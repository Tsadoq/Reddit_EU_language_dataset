During the last two years I have worked on an astro-landscape-photo documentary about La Palma with its natural dark sky and impressive volcanic landscapes. The island is known for many regulations to protect the night sky and I wanted to explore that natural night with my camera to make people aware of what we are losing and already missing in Central Europe. I choose to hike just to enjoy every minute and for all of you who might know - its just stunning how your senses amplify during night! This is my first ever 360° Panorama - taken inbetween Isaac Newton Telescope and the edge of Caldera de Taburiente of La Palma - Full story

Unemployment for people with pre-low-secondary education was 14% as of 2019, yet most immigrants continue to have low education levels, according to [Eurostat](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=File:Analysis_of_the_population_born_outside_the_EU_and_aged_25-54_years,_by_educational_attainment_level,_2018_(%25).png). That said, once these workers get residency status and flee for the cities, they are likely to employ new minimally educated immigrants rather than make efforts to create half-decent job conditions.

This situation is common for Southern Europe: it generally has minimal anti-social dumping protections built into  immigration systems, so companies can freely employ foreigners (either *de jure*, like in Spain, or *de facto* via regularisations - this is not the first one - in Italy). This leads to an oversupply of workers in low-grossing sectors like agriculture, and chronic productivity problems, as the share of active wage people is increasingly tilted towards low-skilled occupations. It is also difficult to change, as there is a huge level of rigidity on the issue, with the right not willing to force companies to invest in productivity gains and the left taking a religious stance that any effort to limit immigration is bad by nature.",,/r/europe/comments/gi6pvg/migrant_workers_regularisation_puts_strain_on/fqd0hu2/,Robi_damian,1589275360

&gt; The same year though [1858], in April, Danilo had ordered ""Pan-Slavic tricolors"" to be made in Kotor, to be future Montenegrin flags. The positions of the three stripes (red, blue and white) was changeable and not established fully. Modeled after the many nations that picked national flags after the French Revolution and inspired by the Slavic nations (in particular Russia), Danilo had made his choice and in July of 1860 in Prcanj in front of his and his Princess Darnika's house, he raised high above a ""white-blueish-red tricolor"". François Lenormant and William Denton described Montenegrin flags in 1865. They compared the Montenegrin national flag to the French, claiming the only difference was it went horizontal.

240,"&gt; They’re called incident, no one says accident as it implies no one is at fault. 

It's the exact opposite, incident implies that nobody is at fault. That's why the police creates incident reports, as the police isn't the judge that can decide if somebody is at fault, it only collects evidence. Heck, incidents don't even imply that anything bad happened. Just that something happened.

Meanwhile: We are talking about something where a person died!

 [https://www.dictionary.com/browse/accident](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/accident) 

&gt;an undesirable or unfortunate happening that occurs unintentionally and usually results in harm, injury, damage, or loss; casualty; mishap

245,"&gt;Among all the large and small nations of Austria, only three standard-bearers of progress took an active part in history, and still retain their vitality — the Germans, the Poles and the Magyars. Hence they are now revolutionary. All the other large and small nationalities and peoples are destined to perish before long in the revolutionary world storm. For that reason they are now counter-revolutionary.

&gt;But at the first victorious uprising of the French proletariat, which Louis Napoleon is striving with all his might to conjure up, the Austrian Germans and Magyars will be set free and wreak a bloody revenge on the Slav barbarians. The general war which will then break out will smash this Slav Sonderbund and wipe out all these petty hidebound nations, down to their very names. The next world war will result in the disappearance from the face of the earth not only of reactionary classes and dynasties, but also of entire reactionary peoples. And that, too, is a progress.

Not really, after the battle of sinope, or more accurately the ""massacre of sinope"" Russia had complete control of the black sea, the region was up for Russia to grab and the Ottomans were in a complete state of panic.

430,"I guess you can ignore all the times that the west propped your failing Empire up in the face of Russian expansion.

Do they teach you about the Crimean war, do they teach you about how the British fleet stopped the Russians at the door of your capital during the Russo-Turkish war, do they teach you about the Egyptian-Turkish war, time and time again you were saved by the west, but your country joins a world war and loses (on it's own accord) and then acts like westerners are out to get them. That's another national myth of yours, the ""invading westerners"" you join a world war, with aggressive acts and irredentism against your neighbors, genocide whole populations of people and then act like you are the victims, and you were fighting for ""Independence"" lol. The reason you view it as a defesnive war is because your armies failed in all their offensive operations, for example in the Caucasus and in Egypt 

Also the west hardly supported the Armenians most of their support came from Russia, which ended in your favor when the soviets took over, and they started aiding you.

Anglos always loved Turks, even during the Asian minor campaign much of the British actually in Anatolia were pro-turkish it was just a few men in London  like Lloyd George and Winston churchill who supported Greece, once the soviets became a viable threat they supported you even more. Even during the greek war of Independence all the western powers where hostile to the greek revolt for years upon years because of the congress of vienna. If the Ottomans had actually been competent and quashed the rebellion early we may not even be an independent state today, And even afterwards the west was always against Greece expanding it's borders unless Russian encroachment was a serious concern , like during the balkan wars.

Even today you are in NATO, a western bloc, your economy is dependent on Europe, you host large American military bases, and nuclear weapons

Stop acting like your country is Iran and is actually a target of the western world. You are not a threat get over yourselves. The only people concerned about you and who you can actually do harm too are your smaller neighbors. If the west really wanted to crush you they would sanction you like they did Iran, your country would collapse in a month

That all being said Turkey is actually very much an imperialist nation itself.

The stuff will still be safe to eat, and though it won't taste as bad as it smells it definitely doesn't taste nice, plus the whole thing of stinking out the house and clothes and everyone's hair.

But really fresh fish at most smells like dew warming in a meadow by the sea, and whilst it is being cooked the smell should be I guess saltier sea breeze, but less distinctly fishy than something like a steak being fried. If rice is being boiled at the same time, the smell of that would overpower the smell of fish that is in optimal condition.

There is a set quota of things that COULD be on the end of year tests, and your teachers prep you for that. Very memorization based. I went to a good, public school (#3 in state) and noticed the pattern that teachers here rarely care. They just want to teach you how to take the tests and move on.

Education is so stressed that a lot of people see it as a negative thing, so act up in class or not apply themselves. Acting up resolves in discipline, usually detention, separation from peers, and scolding. Lots. Of. Scolding. Not applying yourself is common, and most students could pass with flying colors if they had a reason too. Teachers here dont care about how rough your home life is, if you are capable of doing assignments at home, or why you have bruises every other week. They care that they get a pay check and get out.

561,"Actually, Title VI of the Maastricht Treaty, which established the European Union, explicitly agrees on a uniform immigration policy in compliance with the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms as well as the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees. The Maastricht Treaty also incorporates other aspects of progressive social policy, including mandating equal pay between men and women or the general elimination of discriminatory practices, and a promise to advance European integration.

So no, people *did* care even back in 1992, though it is correct that in many cases it took several more years to work out the details on how to promote these values, as the Treaty only laid the groundwork and the basic vision.

Don't get me wrong, though. I absolutely agree on the importance of citizen participation and expression as fundamental pillars of democratic governance. In fact, my commitment to these things forms part of my frustration: The things you say were ""added over time"" (leaving aside that much of it was already referenced in the Maastricht Treaty) were added as a consequence of democratic consensus. What we have now is actually a conservative *minority* holding back the rest of the Union by a certain few countries exploiting veto powers to undermine attempts to censure wayward Member States that transgress against these aforementioned agreed-upon policies.

If you truly believe in European democracy, then you should agree that such behavior is problematic.

When Joshua asked GOD'S Angel if He was for Israel or their enemies the Angel said NEITHER. The Angel just like Christians are part of the LORD Jesus Christ's Kingdom and our loyalty is first to HIM even if it costs us our lives. 

Joshua 5
13 And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand: 
➡️and Joshua went unto him, and said unto him, Art thou for us, or for our adversaries?

14 ➡️And he said, Nay; 
➡️but as captain of the host of the Lord am I now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and did worship, and said unto him, What saith my Lord unto his servant?

15 And the captain of the Lord's host said unto Joshua, Loose thy shoe from off thy foot; for the place whereon thou standest is holy. And Joshua did so.

The UK gov has never said she did not have immunity. So I think you should trust them rather than the Independent. 

&gt; from her viewpoint it would be more beneficial if she faced judgement in UK.

Uh, what? You think it would benefit her more to face a jury? How? Best case scenario, nothing happens. And that’s absolute best. That’s equivalent to not facing the jury at all. 

&gt; This is without taking into account the small chance of being ordered to face judgement by a US court using the much stricter US law.

That’s not going to happen. 

&gt; Tbf my guess is she did not even have a choice and the US government forced her to go back to the US.

Probably. That’s what all governments do. If their diplomat or spies fuck up, they’re sent back home quickly. This means the host country doesn’t need to sit outside the embassy and wait, when really they’re not going to prosecute anyhow (deals exist for this sort of thing) and the embassy won’t need to keep someone locked up all day.",,/r/europe/comments/ghr76h/interpol_issues_red_notice_for_us_diplomats_wife/fqbmdnn/,Devildude4427,1589239708

Ukraine is a backwater to the west. There is no conspiracy to undermine Russia, there is only Ukrainians’ natural desire for close ties to economically robust, non-despotic trading partners.

On the other hand, where population remained overwhelmingly rural until refrigeration became well-established during the twentieth century (e.g. Southern France, Southern Italy, most of Spain), people kept cooking more fresh produce.
Of course it isn't an iron rule: Southern Belgium was industrialised as early as the Midlands, and nevertheless has quite a solid food culture, and the Basque Country industrialised earlier than most of Spain, and yet has one of the world's strongest food cultures.

According to the researchers, Gangelt county has 12,569 inhabitants, of which 400 households participated in the study. Based on the testing for SARS-Cov-2 antibodies in blood samples, the researcher assume that about 15% of the county’s population has been infected. This leads to a case-mortality rate of 0.37 percent.
 
Unfortunately, important numbers remain unmentioned in the document. Assuming that 15% of 12,569 inhabitants have been infected would, by inference, lead to an absolute number of 1,885 cases. If 0.37% of 1,885 persons have died, this leads to the conclusion (or rather, the guess) that there were about 7 fatalities. Furthermore, the researchers report that 600 households were randomly chosen and asked to participate in the study, but only 400 participated (the exact number of persons remains unmentioned). Since 400 is only two thirds of the randomly chosen group, it may be asked whether the motivation to participate in the study may not be due to less-random reasons. For example, it may be possible that people who have already been through the disease may be less fearful of contracting SARS-Cov-2 from the research team.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/ght9s6/german_study_shows_coronavirus_might_not_be_fatal/fqav89f/,dotter101,1589225866

Similarly, *a lot* of chinese people feel that they don't have it so bad, and changing a lot quickly just isn't worth a risk. - My view on the issue is from reading a fair bit about China, but also having quite a few good friends from the chinese upper class.

Not really. The German court is not ruling that the ECB has to do anything because funny enough it doesn't have jurisdiction to do so. All it is doing is saying if ECB doesn't provide sufficient reasoning the Bundesbank can't take part anymore.

You keep repeating that the treaties say so, but they don't.  
That's exactly the issue: when ECJ pretends the treaties give them that authority, they act ultra vires.  

&gt; The Court of Justice of the European Union exceeds its judicial mandate, as determined by the functions conferred upon it in Article 19(1) second sentence of the Treaty on European Union, where an interpretation of the Treaties is not comprehensible and must thus be considered arbitrary from an objective perspective. If the Court of Justice of the European Union crosses that limit, its decisions are no longer covered by Article 19(1) second sentence of the Treaty on European Union in conjunction with the domestic Act of Approval; at least in relation to Germany, these decisions lack the minimum of democratic legitimation necessary under Article 23(1) second sentence in conjunction with Article 20(1) and (2) and Article 79(3) of the Basic Law.

As I got closer to my house, a gang of four or five of them rode past me on the pavement, and after seeing me every single one of them whistled or made a comment towards me. I work hard, I pay taxes, how is it accepted as the norm that we can have so many unskilled young guys who have nothing to offer to us coming to Europe, and harassing us. In normal times, you get approached every five minutes by someone with a bracelet or some other crap, some of whom get aggressive when you refuse them. Go on youtube and look at how many 'Europe bracelet scam' videos there are on there. It has become the norm that these guys will approach you and try and scam you out of money. Not even just in Italy, I've seen it in Spain, in Greece, Cyprus. How do our governments not realise how damaging this has become to our image? This is not how things should work, but unfortunately if you speak against mass uncontrolled and unskilled immigration you're labelled as a 'racist', and the only people who talk about these problems are heavily flawed in many other ways (I'm looking at you Salvini).

If they ever stop being able to obtain the income... well, that's what replacement incomes are for, aren't they?

Mortgage qualifications change if you can put in some capital of your own.

The clause is based on the net value of the house after deducting the debt, so ironically people who only have the mortgage debt and the house would *not* be affected, but people who already have made substantial payments in the past would be forced to sell their house, perhaps in a suboptimal market. This often would mean that older people with their house that used to house their family would be forced to sell and move out of their familiar neighbourhood where they have a support network. It's just counterproductive.

Also, it's income assistance, not a blanket mortage payment.

Secondly - it's the median disposable income - not the average. The average disposable income is probably higher in Germany than Kentucky but what is considered a middle income (i.e the income furthest away from the poorest AND the richest) is much higher in Kentucky. In plain English - people with decent jobs in Kentucky earn more than people with decent jobs in Germany.

Thirdly - I have no doubt life is expensive in LA for all the reasons you say - but how much are people paid there? For what I do - I would earn twice as much for the same job in any major US city (and more than that in San Francisco or Seattle). That's at mid-level. At senior level I could expect €85k here in Europe whereas it would be upwards of €200k in the US not including stock options. It doesn't even compare.

Constitutional organs are afforded wide political latitude in this context. **They may retroactively legitimate an exceeding of competences** by initiating – within the limits set by Art. 79(3) GG – an amendment of EU primary law [...] and, by way of the procedure set out in Art. 23(1) second and third sentence GG, formally transfer the sovereign powers that were exercised *ultra vires.* However, where this is either not possible or not wanted, the constitutional organs are required to use legal or political means to work towards the rescission of acts not covered by the European integration agenda (Integrationsprogramm ), and – as long as such acts continue to have effect – to take suitable action seeking to limit the domestic impact of such acts to the greatest extent possible [...].

The sole fact that only distinguishes between utility vs rooftop usage thrashes the whole thing, unless you add the usage of energy storage systems and whether direct consumption is used or not. That alone makes a 40% difference on the overall figure.

And just to conclude, public opinion killed nuclear years ago. And not for any rational reason but FUD alone. That lead to heavy disinvestment on the running reactors, making them unserviceable in the short term.
Coal alone killed tens of thousands, every single year, more than nuclear ever will.

However, now it seems nuclear is no longer economically sound, and it’s getting worse by the day, as PV and wind combined with Hydro storage is breaking cost ever week.",,/r/europe/comments/ggd072/electricity_carbon_density_in_2019_for_the_5_most/fq9ephe/,Tafinho,1589195829

1265,"But it depends what you mean by ""European identity"". Do I feel ""closer"" to a Greek or Portuguese than to an Indonesian or Kenyan? Sure I do. 
But that says nothing about me actually feeling that ""close"" to a Greek or Portuguese, it just says that I feel even less close to others. 

Just because we share a continent with other countries doesn't mean we feel close to them in any way. Closer than most really far-away countries sure but not actually close at all.

Take Bulgaria and Danmark for example, different peoples, different cultures, different histories, different languages, different politics, different tastes in entertainment etc. etc. I basically know nothing about Bulgaria, I don't think I've ever met a Bulgarian, I don't understand a word of their language, we share no real history etc. Why would I feel ""close"" to a Bulgarian then? Simply because we're both members of EU and nothing else?

The only countries I actually feel somewhat close to (outside of Denmark) would be other Nordic countries, and more distantly you could maybe argue for countries like Germany and Netherlands due to cultural similarities etc. and maybe the UK due to cultural exports, their language being lingua franca. If I was traveling around Canada or whatever and I met a guy from one of the more distant (from Denmark) countries in Europe, I wouldn't identify more with him than I would with the average Canadian. Honestly, I think most Danes would identify more with Canadians than with far away countries in Europe that we've never really had anything to do with.

1308,"&gt; Once heard a greek doctor now working in Denmark talking about the difference in working environment. He said that it wasn't uncommon for him to work 14 hour shifts in Greece but that would then also account for coffee breaks, chatting to co-workers, smoking etc. In Denmark he'd only work 8 hours but when he worked he would actually work and not do anything else.

Yeah, what counts as work is very much dependent on culture. You can also see this in different industries. Like, one of my older relatives stubbornly refused to give up the small-scale family farm (you know, some potatoes here, a couple of cows in a field over there, some onions in another field, sell the surplus to pay for what you can't grow yourself) and kept it up until he retired in the 90s (despite basically losing money toward the end).

As a kid I heard from teachers and other adults that farmers worked very very hard, that they got up at sunset and didn't get to go back home until long after sunset. And this was why even those old miserable jobs every day of the week in horrible conditions in factories were considered better than farming. And I looked at this relative and assumed they were right. After all, he would sometimes come puttering past our house to drop in to say hi on his way back as we were getting up in the morning.

Later on I figured out that yeah, he'd get up at five in the morning,  but he'd also take an hour or two mid-morning to have a solid breakfast, drink his morning coffee, listen to the radio and read the paper. And to him a couple of hours of wandering around the edge of a field making small repairs to the fence to keep the neighbor's horses from getting in was work. So yeah, he worked long days, but unlike the rest of us he didn't have anyone hanging over his shoulder making sure he worked  hard (or pretended to) and he took frequent long breaks just because he felt like it.",Sweden,/r/europe/comments/ghj01h/average_annual_hours_actually_worked_per_worker/fq97isp/,_throwawayagain_,1589188402

1357,"It's funny how while some national stereotypes seem to have some sparkle of truth, some others seem to be fairly unfounded.

For example, I was kind of surprised when I discovered that there's a joke about Italians being slow or lazy.

There's kind of a strong culture of work here, that gets to maniacal levels in some regions, like Lombardy.

Other places in Italy take the piss off them because of how obsessed they are with working, how much in a rush they seem to be all the time and all that.

I thought that maybe other places were even more obsessed, so we seemed chilled by comparison.

Then I started travelling, I lived abroad for a long time, and realized that wasn't the case at all.

All the times I had contractors or engineers at home to do some work I was like ""fucking hell guys, can we pick up the pace a little bit?"". Also, when I lived in England I was surprised that at 5 o'clock sharp they put their tools down and went to the pub. In Italy it would be considered weird, you finish whatever you're in the middle of first, and then you go, whatever the time is.

So, my guess shifted to ""Maybe foreigners experienced Southern Italy work attitude and made stereotypes from that"". I'm from the North, and we have our own stereotypes about Southerners being lazy fucks.

Then I eventually moved back to Italy, in the South of Puglia this time, and I was shocked by the crazy hours these people work.

Just the other day I took my car to the mechanic. He told me to get there at 7am because it was open, and to get it back any time after lunch, as they don't close for a break. Since I didn't have anyone to drive me there, he drove my car back to my house at around 10 in the evening.You do the math of how many hours this guy works. No wonder his wife dumped him last year.

Anyway.

Anecdotal examples, but I really wonder where the stereotype came from, biased as it can be, my perception of how fucking much and how fast Italians work has always been more than I've seen abroad, by comparison.",Italy,/r/europe/comments/ghj01h/average_annual_hours_actually_worked_per_worker/fq97wc4/,Pisodeuorrior,1589188798

Now if those billionaires move abroad (which is generally bad thing to happen to a country), average goes down while median again stays the same so the country looks better in the stat. Same effect with Sweden (a lot of billionaires) and to lesser degree Czech Republic as well.

1447,"&gt; The accusations levied against Mbembe center around two texts he has authored. One is in the forward he wrote for the 2015 book “Apartheid Israel: The Politics of an Analogy,” a collection of articles by 18 scholars of Africa and its diaspora on the similarities and differences between apartheid-era South Africa and contemporary Israel.

&gt;“The occupation of Palestine is the greatest moral scandal of our times, one of the most dehumanizing ordeals of the century we have just entered, and the biggest act of cowardice of the last half-century,” wrote Mbembe, and concluded his forward asserting that “the time has come for global isolation.”

&gt;The second text is from his book “The Politics of Enmity,” in which he compares elements of the Israeli settlement enterprise, as well as the destruction of the Jews of Europe, to the colonial fixtures of the apartheid regime in South Africa, which he calls “emblematic manifestations of this phantasy of separation.”

(...)

&gt; Numerous artists and intellectuals who engage in or express support for boycotts of Israel, and specifically the BDS call, have faced punitive consequences in Germany.

&gt;In September 2019, a German jury reversed its decision to grant a book award to author Kamila Shamsie over her participation in a cultural boycott of Israel. Last summer, American rapper Talib Kweli was disinvited from a summer festival for endorsing BDS. And as I reported on +972, the director of Berlin’s Jewish Museum was forced to resign last year after the museum favorably tweeted an article about a letter by Jewish and Israeli scholars that challenged Germany’s equation of BDS with antisemitism.

&gt;While such silencing of Israel critics appears to have increased, it has rarely received as much attention or pushback in Germany as it has this time. Mbembe’s case seems to have a struck a stronger chord in part because he is an internationally recognized scholar and because, for many, it crosses a red line vis-a-vis academic freedom.",Finland/Sweden,/r/europe/comments/ghc20p/germany_jewish_israeli_scholars_back_african/fq91ho2/,vallraffs,1589182256

1538,"Sure, w oke come from ""awoken"" to mock how some people, very often liberal, all of a sudden have become ""awaken"" to social sensitivities, when in reality these people become **pretentious, self righteous,** and hostile. This is best shown with examples. 

The CP2077 game play showed the main character, fighting a Haitian gang called the animals. A very liberal ""journalist"" accused the game of being a ""white supremacists dream""  and of racism, going around killing black people and calling them animals. 

Despite the fact that 

1)actual Haitians were happy they were represented and that the developers put put effort into making the characters speak actual Haitian creole. And did not see any racism here.

2)The setting is a city in California, in the part of the city populated by Haitian people, just like you have Chinese or Italian communities in cities, the gangs there will obviously be of the same communities. 

3) You design your character, so you can make them black and go into the white neighborhood and shoot white people too. 

4) The creator of cyberpunk2077, a Black American responded to this explaining he is happy about having a black gang and he chose to name them the Animals because they are wild and strong, nothing to do with race. 

And after this was explained to ""Journalist"" do you think the misunderstanding was cleared? No. They became more stubborn insisting the game is racist and he even told Mike Pondsmith, the black creator of CP, he ""doesn't get to decide what is racist or not"", And this ""Journalist"" is a liberal white guy btw. You see, this is the stereotypical ""w oke"" person, They have just ""awaken"" to how much racism there is and they feel the need to go preach, and they think they are making the world a better place, but they are not, they are just annoying. Its very obvious animal was not used in an offensive way and had nothing to do with race and this whole controversy was just a desperate attempt to find racism where none exists to satisfy there desire to ""**preach**"". 

Another example is Kingdom Come, it is a VERY historically accurate medieval game that takes place in Kingdom of Bohemia. It was heavily criticized for no black people in the game. Obviously there is nothing wrong with having a diverse video game character list, and having blacks in the game would not ruin it, but being in a medieval Czech village it wouldn't make any sense, and it would be funny. But whats wrong with a historically accurate game of white people? Nothing but because these ""w oke"" people believe in diversity they want to push this agenda and want all video games to **preach** this. 

Another good example is the Last of Us 2, the sequel has become very controversial very recently because the company went full ""w oke"".  The company hired Anita Sharkesian, a crazy feminis who wants to reform video games, and who has been heavily made fun of by video gamers because she doesn't understand games and thinks EVERYTHING is racist, im not joking, if you youtube her you will find channels dedicating to exposing how crazy her vies are. She influenced the game, and now it is so obviously **preaching** a certain social agenda,  two of the main characters are a lesbian and trans girl and the plot involves hunting homophobi c christians.... When any employees make any criticisms of the game they get called homophodes and closed minded, its so bad that 70% of the development team quit. 

I understand that sometimes good stories can make social criticisms and be thought provoking but when it gets to the point that your game feels like your at a feminist/LGBT parade it too much and people get upset. 

Here are two videos discussing the issue with the Last of Us2 because it is very recent news.

1566,"Dacia Romana existed for 165 years. As a result, the Romanian language started to develop, a process which took a few centuries. There's plenty written about it. Wikipedia is a good starting point. 

Language and culture, though they are associated, in my mind at least, are different concepts. 

I would argue that Romanian culture is just that: Romanian. It can be said that it has Latin influences, but then it has many others. 

Now this does not belittle us in any way in terms of our Latin roots.

And no, I'm not from Italy. I'm from Romania. 

PS: the only reason I commented on your reply in the first place was to make you check your dates. The Dacians were not under Roman occupation for 500 years. Also, during the 165 years of occupation, not all of today Romania was conquered, and the unoccupied territories warred against the Romans almost every opportunity they had.

I'm really interested in how these systems are going to be implemented within the next decade. It seems like the ""tamer"" models, that punish crimes and reward good samaritans are quite popular, but there has also been a lot of pushback against more comprehensive versions.

The US system is actually quite harsh, too: There, private companies can collect and sell any information about you that they want, and even just being accused of a crime can lead to being published on various websites, considerably lessening your chances at employment or renting a flat. Credit agencies are ubiquitious, and health insurance has a deep dive on what you do and how you do it and will reward/punish you with better or worse rates.

1662,"B12 supplement is vegan. Therefore your point is moot.

Also, the reason why you have to supplement it in the first place is because B12 can't be produced by animals at all. (That's why it's essential you get it through diet.) No pigs, no cows, no chickens and not even fish can make it themselves. B12 comes from bacteria that lives in the soil and clings to the produce we get. In aquatic environments, most phytoplankton acquire vitamin B12 through a symbiotic relationship with bacteria, and they become food for larval fish and bivalves. Due to modern agriculture, pesticides, herbicides and lots and lots of washing of the produce we don't have enough of the bacteria on the produce anymore tho. That's why farm animals are given plenty of B12 supplement too. That means when you take B12 supplement yourself, you really are just cutting out the middle man. Also consider that lots of products such as plant milk, meat replacements and sweets are fortified with B12.

For reference, 20,000 people was ~1% of Norway’s population, so having multiple successive years with that many on their way out is really eyebrow-raising. Norway was heavily linking itself to the UK’s trade network as a large merchant marine (which was also getting upgraded to steam in this timeframe I think, there’s another expense), I think that Sweden was trying to build up more production with protectionist measures and moreso focused on Germany when it did look out (causing consternation and contributing to the union being dissolved a couple decades later, the cracks were evident at this time.).

But it seems that while China fucked up at the beginning with covering it up for a week or two, which had a big effect on the virus spreading, they did respond to it very effectively. Due to their authoritarian nature they where able to just shut down everything and stop it in its track. Doesn't make authoritarianism worth it but it is more efficient and can respond well with something like this. And the Chinese gov will probably try to get approval by pointing out how much worse the virus ended up elsewhere. But this virus will probably cause a global depression and maybe even topple governments all around the world, even in the west, due to economic reasons and despair . So I'd think that would be the larger concern for the Chinese gov, that a global depression could threaten them as they rely on a growing economy for the populations approval and to sell their goods worldwide.

1738,"&gt; ECJ is guardian of treaties  

The supreme court disagrees and has disagreed for over 25 years, that's just not what the treaty says in german jurisprudence.  
And the only legal paths ECJ can take to push on this are reinterpretation of the treaty, which will force the supreme court to declare it unconstitutional then void it, or say they've evolved the power to declare their own jurisdiction, [which was denied in 1993](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kompetenz-kompetenz) and will force the supreme court to void the treaty.  

ECJ can either rule in cooperation with the supreme court and respect the fundamental rights of the constitution in their judgements, or not, then the supreme court is the ultimate authority.  

&gt; this is ending with BVG asking if ECB is federal institution and ECB responding with ""yes, what are going to do about it?""  

If an EU institution publicly declares that the EU is a sovereign federation and the member countries are subordinate, the EU breaks that very day. [The EU is not a federal state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staatenverbund).

Treaty of Stolbovo in 1600s gave Sweden the rest. 1721 south of Karelia was transferred back to Russians, until 1809 after Finnish war it was moved under Grand Duchy of Finland, until 1938-1945, when it was finally ceded back. Before 1328, it is very hard to say who ""owned"" it since it was largely just a desolate land between nations. You can't say that Finland was really owned by anyone either. It was during the era when there was LOTS of unclaimed land, which includes most of Finland, Karelia, the entire Lapland and Kola peninsula. NO ONE owned it before 1300s. The region was inhabited by nomadic tribes that really were not loyal to any king.

The claim Russia that has had Karelia from 11th century is wrong.. No one has owned it so long to claim it as their own.

Without millions of Soviets soldier - here is never be a victory. Americans came only in the mid of 1944 - when it was easier. Why they didn't came in 1941? Because they were afraid.

Actually I don't want to continue this discussion.

you can't deny their contribution to victory and could honor their sacrifices because they were simple people who believed in good and bright things. And this is not about communism.

The other thing you mean is the self-image of Austria in history.

Tax *evasion* involves breaking tax laws.  It is illegal.

1782,"You’ve clearly never served. I don’t say that to be a dick, but allow someone who has served to enlighten you: 99% of servicemen, especially volunteers, serve for personal reasons. I served, not because I believed in the grand ideals of the United States or its war on terrorism or whatever, but because I had student loans to pay back and I couldn’t find a better paying job. I knew a guy who knocked up his girl and needed better health insurance for her. I knew a guy who was looking at jail time and made a deal with the judge to join instead. I never knew a servicemember, even the crazy jarhead bullet sponges, who served because they believed in patriotic ideals so much that they were willing to put their lives on the line. They were doing it to be tough, or to pay for college, or because they didn’t have a better option. That’s why servicemembers are usually mostly drawn from the lower/poor classes. 

All this guy is saying is that not every soldier that served in the Red Army or Wermacht (sp?) was a Jew killing Nazi/Commie rapist rat bastard.

1937,"In the end, the German constitutional court has done us a favour. Its ruling last week highlighted the toxic idea that the eurozone can forever rely for its survival on its central bankers, and their enthusiasm in pushing EU laws to the limits.

 Or maybe beyond — as the German court wrote in a case last week on the European Central Bank’s public sector purchasing programme.

The court asserted that the ECB transgressed its competences and violated German constitutional law.

The original German version of the ruling is 110 pages long, while the English translation runs to more than 90. I don’t think many people have yet fully digested all the technical details. I do not believe, as some commentators have suggested, that the court was only asking the ECB for a clarification.

 Although a member of the bank’s council suggested that it would take the ECB five minutes to satisfy the request, I do not agree. They are still in denial.

In particular, I do not see how it is possible for the ECB to meet the court’s criteria for making the purchasing programme conform to the ruling unless it changes some of its parameters. 

The ECB will in future still buy assets and provide emergency relief. But I suspect that the central bank will, in the long run, hold fewer assets on its balance sheet as a consequence of this ruling.

In section 212 of the decision, the court states that the lack of a pre-determined exit strategy increases risks. In section 235, near the very end, it obliges the Bundesbank, the German central bank, to “ensure that the bonds already purchased . . . and held in its portfolio are sold based on a — possibly long-term — strategy.”

Earlier it argues that the €2tn stock of assets on the ECB’s balance sheet constitutes a risk that encroaches on the competences of national parliaments. I think the ECB will struggle to answer all, or even most, of the court’s concerns.

Beware of innocuous sounding words in the judgment like “obvious”, “evident” or “proportionate”. What is obvious to a lawyer may not be obvious to the rest of us — and vice versa.

The notion of proportionality is particularly central to German constitutional law. It requires government and lawmakers to ensure that policy does not over-reach and takes account of the interests of all parties. The court tends to subject its assessment of proportionality to rigorous tests. But it is in the nature of monetary policy that it has to be disproportionate at times.

The ECB is, of course, not subject to German law. As an EU institution it answers to the European Court of Justice. But this ruling is binding on the Bundesbank. I doubt that Jens Weidmann, its president, will want to fob off the German judges with a superficial response.

The ruling only allows the Germans to take part in the asset purchase programme for another three months unless they find a way to comply. Theoretically, the ECB could proceed without Germany. 

But I would strongly advise against it because that could precipitate a eurozone break-up.

Since its 1993 ruling upholding the legality of the Maastricht treaty, the German constitutional court has become more radical. But it avoided outright confrontation, until last week.

I find the most troubling aspect of this ruling is the assertion that the ECJ was also transgressing its competences by approving the bond buying and has gone ultra vires, in the Latin jargon of German constitutional lawyers.

This part of the ruling raises deeply troubling issues for the relationship between the EU and its member states. The German court accepts the principle that EU law overrides national law for areas they specifically recognise lie within the EU’s competence. But they reserve the right to decide whether the EU and the ECJ are operating inside or outside their legal remits. It sets a troubling precedent.

The smartest response to this ruling would be for the EU to address the problems of the eurozone head on: lack of convergence between north and south, debt sustainability and, most important right now, the issuance of mutualised debt to finance a recovery fund.

2020,"*Just gonna copy most of my previous assessment on this.*

Infringement procedures against the German government, because the independent courts have finally had to use ultra vires in a decision entirely in line with over 25 years of precedent.  
That's funny, the court is independent of the government, so you're forcing parliament to choose between being in violation of treaty or accepting your reinterpretation of the treaty and having the treaty thus be voided by the court due to unconstitutionality.  

Great idea, not a political move at all.  


&gt; the European Commission have said that EU law holds precedence over national regulations. They added that the European Court of Justice’s rulings were binding for courts in the 27 member states of the bloc.

The way this is phrased is entirely correct and entirely misleading, which might well be the point so they can paddle backwards when the move fails.  
This entire conflict is not about primacy of EU law over national regulations, or rulings of ECJ binding national courts, it is about **whether EU law has primacy over national constitutions (in most member states it does not)** and **rulings of ECJ that violate the constitutional norms of the country not being binding to the supreme constitutional court (a position that has been held for over 25 years and cannot be overturned without a new treaty)**.  


The interpretation that EU law has primacy over national constitutions has never been an accepted position in most member states, no matter how loudly someone on the EU stage yells it.  
Just think about it for a second, why would several countries have passed amendments to their constitutions during the process of joining the EU if any conflicting EU law would simply overrule the constitution anyway?  
The treaties were simply not interpreted to mean that when they were passed and the supreme court explicitly ruled at the time that the treaty does not give ECJ the power to determine its own jurisdiction either.",,/r/europe/comments/gh641l/eu_could_open_legal_case_against_germany_over_ecb/fq6uouo/,acinc,1589138078

2060,"&gt; First, your English is really, really good. I have a friend in Nuremberg who I often forget is not a native English speaker, and even he makes mistakes sometimes which you did not make even once. 

You genuinely only say that because you don't hear me speak.  
Holding a conversation in writing is far easier than actually doing it through speech.  
That usually ends in ""uh....... uh ........ uh"" and more place holder ""uh""'s.  
It's the reason why I don't use English speaking discord servers.

Also it's [the current year], I have a dictionary in my browser.

&gt; I didn't mean to detract from how disastrous World War 2 was for Germany, I only condensed what I was trying to say, because the only people I know with firsthand experience from that time period are American, and so I have only heard about how awesome the economy was for the average person here in the 1950s. That, and the constant fear of being rained on by Soviet nukes.  
&gt; So yeah, I wasn't trying to gloss over this subject, only describe the usual American narrative of life after the war ended, and also that it is just strange to bring up these topics and to automatically associate them with modern Germans, two or three generations removed from these events.

I know. My reaction is the usual German bluntness. You are lucky this didn't happen in person as I probably would've stared too.

&gt;I mean, even today you have businesses who go around and defuse old aerial bombs. I saw one of these when I visited. We simply have no concept of anything like this, because the last time a war was fought at home, there weren't airplanes or anti tank mines.

The Chinese American started talking about how corrupt and shitty China is and the Chinese Chinese people got pissed and tried to negate everything he said.  
  
Another group assignment a few months later I am in a group with a Chinese girl from Shenyang (75 miles from the North Korean border) and a South Korean guy.

She grew up 75 miles from North Korea and had no idea of what the country was like, or that there was an insane dictator or any of that.

Czechs Poles Lithuanians Hungarians Estonians have the same opinion of the bygone era where they were occupied by USSR.

People in DDR suddenly woke up as the poor men in unified Germany where their old failing industry has collapsed because it was not able to competed no one in their right mind would buy a Trabant if VW was available.DDR was also a ""demonstration"" soviet republic enjoying far higher standard of living than any other place in east bloc.

Old system had higher job security and you were ""being taken care off"" just like being in jail provides you these things.Unemployment was often illegal and people were given jobs that produced no useful goods or services for other you had insane investments like steel mils built hundreds of km away from raw materials that employed tens of thousands of people that instantly collapsed when they had to pay market prices for materials they used instead of allocated goods.People were waiting for 10-20 years to get a 45m^2 apartament for family of 3-4 built in an incredibly shoddy way and half of the equipment that was supposed to get installed was stolen in process walls were crooked because jointing prefab sections was done incorrectly but no one cared.No One Cares is a good way to describe why everything in east bloc was of low quality and very expensive there was no upside of making goods in a more efficient way or keeping quality standards.

People in the west don't understand the mindset of people in post soviet states.Also these questions asked are very vague and change from language to language somehow no nation in EE has voted to go back to planned economy and everyone is enjoying incredible prosperity and freedom provided by the market system similarly these nations joined NATO asap because it protected them from future Russian invasion bringing the old system back.

&gt;And it doesn't matter if states are russia lite. being russian does not mean that their experience under the USSR is diminished and it completely undermines that its mostly westerners that view communism favorably. the evidence clearly points towards the other direction.

I try to explain you why Russians overlook shortages of consumer goods or liberties in the old period and how national pride is when combined with nostalgia for the bygone era changing their perspective on soviet period if you talk to people in former east bloc it is quite clear what they think about the system.

There were beneficiaries of old system like party members or certain protected professional groups that lost a lot on transition but thank god that finally being a miner is less prestigious than being a medical doctor like soviet period often caused due to role of energy exports to the west as critical source of USD that later was used to buy necessary products because socialist economies were unable to produce anything other than resources that was bought in the west.You had special stores with yellow curtains that only militia men or miners can shop in and these were supplied way better than what average worker ones.

2176,"&gt; Yes I do. As a society we have to accept a certain level of risk. 

That is true. Some risk assessement is alway at play, but:

&gt;There are many things that are harmful but are permitted such as cigarettes, alcohol, cars and eating unhealthy but as a society we allow it.

These, however, most of these are not good examples (From your flair I assume you are a fellow EU citizen, so I'll limit myself to EU centric examples):
 - Tobbaco usage is nowadays quite restricted, and AFAIK in most of the EU there are strict laws in place that most definetelly limit the freedom to smoke in order to protect other people who *don't want to smoke*;
 - Alcohol...Well I actually live in one the countries with less restrictions on alcohol consuption if you are an adult, but even here you are not free to drink if you are to perform certain actions afterward (like but not limited to driving), and these limitations are also in place to ensure *other people's freedom from being killed by a drunk driver*; And if you travel to certain Northern European EU nations, well, even I think that's BS,
 - Cars: Oh Boy...Where do we start...An example the limiting access to city centers, if you car doesn't comply with a minimum emissions standards (in the case of my country, there is no grandfathering, if you just found that your car, which you've owned for quite some time, due to such standards being non existing when it was built, well you are SOL, like I was), and these (potential) limits on your freedom to drive your car were justified by protection of public health, once again *your freedom to drive your car is limited by the freedom of other people to not get sick from exposures to particualtes and emissions* (I'm leavin the all CO2 question aside now,, becasue that's another issue);
We could also include the mandatory periodic inspections which (good or bad) most definetelly can affect your freedom to spend or not money on your car.

The last, Unhealthy Eating is probably the only issue where I might concede a point, as the freedom to eat crap (which we all do on ocasion) really doesn't affect other's freedoms, but some EU countries are already studying taxing salt and sugar content, based on the impact of unhealthy eating habits on Healthcare costs (which are a public issue). I'm on the fence on this one, but am still inclined, for now, to dislike these limits, precisely because it is, from your examples, the one where exercising your freedom does not have an impact on other peoples freedoms.

&gt; It is also the same thing with many other disease. There is a flu season every year and plenty of people die from it but we accept that risk and let society continue on as normal.

Well, for the flu, vaccination does exist (more or less effective, but still), therefore if you decide to be exposed and unvaccinated it's **your** choice, and *theoretically* vaccinated people **who do not wish to be exposed thus vaccinated themselves** should not be at risk (I know I'm way oversimplifying but for the purpose let's assume the vaccine is always effective).
In this case, there is still no vaccine, so those people that do not wish to be sick **will have their personal freedom atacked** by people that choose to ignore confinement. Once there is a vaccine, then we can revisit the issue.

In the end, in a modern society, like the one we in the EU have, at least for now, while we must always be wary of attempts to limit our freedom, we must also accept that no one as more rights that anyone else, and our freedoms can not be at cost of another citizen's own freedoms (and vice versa). And this may mean, sadly, government actions, which should always (hopefull *should*) try to minimize the risks of the majority. 

(I could also go on a tangent here and bring the hierarchy of individual needs and how they relate to any society wide risk assessment, but I don't want to cause rage induced strokes to certain people)",,/r/europe/comments/ggotiz/30_people_tried_to_protest_the_lockdown_today_in/fq6i1v5/,GrinningCrocodile,1589131927

Your problem is, that the people you accuse of „defending war criminals“ went through this. Your problem is, that you do not even have a little understanding about what that mean.

2341,"&gt;Well now you're just pointing out other problems with capitalism ;). Specifically fractional reserve banking and central bank inflation that comes with interest payments.
&gt;
&gt;Also, that's a terrible example. Most major stocks in (for example) the s&amp;p500 are vast multinationals with assets across the world.

That presents a whole other set of problems but let's assume it's only a US buyout.

&gt;Secondly, markets price in future value, not current value. (at this point I feel adding a disclaimer that I'm a full time trader is required).

It doesn't really matter what goes into the price. It's what the market decided, so it's what the government must pay.
Just curious, why are you a socialist when your job is literally capitalism in its purest real  life form?

&gt;Finally,you would assume a socialist leaning government would have relatively high taxation and control of the currency. They could inflate the cash into existence if they wanted to.

Let's assume we *could* do that without creating a hyperinflated economic disaster. Now we've successfully bought out the US equity markets. And the derivatives market was just a good sport about it and nullified all of their contracts. Now you still have an unequal distribution of wealth. Without some absurdly oppressive taxation scheme or outright seizure, the bulk of capital is still in private hands and the people who know how to run the companies all quit.

&gt;You may not like these methods, but clearly they are not totalitarian and they are entirely within the task of possibility.

Buying all of my shit when it isn't for sale without some particularized ends for it is totalitarian.

No, ECJ is not the court in charge of interpreting the treaties in Germany.  

This is the job of the german supreme court, who did that in their 1993 Maastrich and 2009 Lisbon decisions, to which they are now referring in this ruling.  
In those treaty interpretations they specifically thought about and discarded both the idea that ECJ would have the last word on constitutional matters and that ECJ would be able to define its own jurisdiction.  
Those would be the only interpretations to justify your opinion and both were ruled unconstitutional and discarded at the time.

2376,"There are multiple companies working on the field, but when they ""fly too close to the sun"" and start large projects, they end up having to cancel the projects midway for various reasons (mostly funding).

The following YouTube videos (in Portuguese) have a very nice summary:

* Part 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZh7i2tz_I0
* Part 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NU2BYLyuXAQ
* Part 3: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jADiaNU5-vY

One thing that seems to be missing from those videos (which is understandable, since that was quite a hot topic that, AFAIR, was never really explained), is a reference to the ""GAMES 2004/2006"" events and the [APROJE](https://agc.sg.mai.gov.pt/details?id=631361)/[GameInvest](https://www.mobygames.com/company/gameinvest-sa) drama. Most of the information regarding that seems to have been lost (and I don't recall a lot of the details), but long story short:

Circa 2006 there was a ton of promise for investment in Portuguese video games, with [Portalegre becoming the ""GameDev capital""](https://www.publico.pt/2006/09/26/portugal/noticia/hollywood-dos-jogos-electronicos-devera-nascer-perto-de-portalegre-1271420), APROJE offering multiple gamedev courses and GAMEINVEST providing investment and acting as a publisher for multiple games.

Since it's 2020 and you are asking ""We have a video game industry?"", I think it's obvious that things didn't go well :P

Some of the courses offered by APROJE were of dubious quality (I think they might have been sued for false claims) and the 2007 edition of the GAMES event never happened, and Portalegre is pretty isolated, which pretty much forced APROJE to close.

GAMEINVEST also had it's share of problems, so they ended up only being able to publish smaller games (IIRC, one of their flagship titles was [""Blitz and Massive""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dthwGUHK6cc), which never got released).

Overall, I believe that this sequence of events (and the 2008 financial crisis) heavily affected the Portuguese gamedev community. We are now finally seeing some new studios publishing quality indie games (with a mix of small mobile games, possibly to help with the funding), so maybe things will get better in the future.",Portugal,/r/europe/comments/ggmfwy/popular_video_games_developed_in_europe_oc/fq5ttse/,JD557,1589117285

2474,"It's because you have a wrong perception of democracy so I gave you an example in the form of USA. 'Viable opposition' is about as far from democracy as you can get. Was the society everyone attributes as the first democracy, ancient Athens, a democracy? You didn't have parties there. You had factions based on where people lived, but no parties. Was the Venetian republic a democracy? Parties have nothing to do with democracy. What's more, parties limit democracy to the views of individuals who you have to choose between. That creates the American situation where no matter what's your political opinion, you have to choose between just 2 candidates. Also, you can't really change who's in power. Maybe in some ideal society. Over half the voting pool of Bosnia doesn't use its voting power because we know our vote doesn't matter. It's just how discount western democracy works.

I didn't call Tito a democratic leader, I called him more democratic than what people think. I'm not a Titoist.

...and yet exactly those people got in power. Don't you begin to see a pattern? I personally know people who were in the party, completely disagreeing with it.

Someone doesn't know history! Stalin said social democracy is 'objectively the lighter form of fascism'. That was put on paper by Stalin, but the general opinion of all Socialist Authoritarians. All Marxists who weren't in line with the party opinion were generally hated by the party even more than other groups. Also you named me groups that weren't actually prosecuted. You're just convinced they were. Only quite extreme ones were prosecuted. Also Žižek spoke openly against Tito, do you need more? It's a bigger threat to an authoritarian socialist country to have itself disconnected from Socialism than the rise of other ideologies.

Are you seriously listing Wikipedia as a source? Seriously? How about you instead read a book and talk to people who were actually powerful and in charge in SFRY?

Again, you're listing Wikipedia. Also, that (wrong) definition does mostly apply to Yugoslavia before Tito's death, but not Yugoslavia after Tito's death when non-Socialists were taking over. In the 80's there were artificial shortages made by corrupted officials to get rich. Things like eg. shampoo.

You said 'until the end of the 80's' which obviously means they were allowed then. Use logic.

I commented on your uses of the words 'communist' and 'socialist'. There was never communism in any country. 'Communist government' is an oxymoron. Also that was the end of Authoritarian Socialism. If you want proof that isn't real Socialism, consult Lenin's and Trotsky's books.

2489,"English translation:  In the end, the judges of our constitutional court will not do much politically with their judgment on the ECB's bond purchase programs, but at least they have maintained their self-respect. This does not apply to other German actors.  The recent ruling by the Federal Constitutional Court on the ECB's bond purchase program has received quite a bit of attention. Not only in Germany, but also in Brussels. There, the EU Commission is apparently seriously considering initiating infringement proceedings against Germany because the highest German court has dared to criticize the ECB, but even more strongly the ECJ, and to refuse to comply with it. This is remarkable because the Commission has never been really irritated by the violation of the stability pact for the euro area by countries such as France and Italy. An infringement procedure against France on such a question would be completely unthinkable, as the former Commission chief Junker has always emphasized. But there are obviously fundamentally different rules for Germany. Could it be that it is somehow connected to the ""liberation"" of Germany 75 years ago? This idea is not entirely absurd. But that may not be the central issue for the moment.  An infringement proceeding against Germany would be all the more astonishing, since the Karlsruhe judgment actually left the ECB completely free to pave the way for even more extensive monetary financing. The ECB has to justify such measures a little more verbose than before, instead of simply hiding behind the inflation target of two percent. Then the way is clear for the extensive debt relief of the weaker states of the Eurozone via the ECB's purchase programs, in the end up to the cancellation of the purchased bonds from the ECB's balance sheet, their complete monetization. Reasons will also be found for this, which the successors of the current judges in Karlsruhe will find plausible in the end. This is all the more true because one can be sure that the political parties who ultimately determine who will be judges in Karlsruhe will ensure that no lawyer who wants to mess up with the EU and the ECB will be promoted there. It is as safe as amen in the church.

 However, the ruling of the Constitutional Court is not primarily directed against the ECB, but against the ECJ, which is accused, however, with remarkable openness, of practicing legal botch by basically doing everything that serves to further disempower nation states in Europe for the ECB's measures that are in good condition and then also appropriate, actually waved unchecked; according to the principle: what benefits the stability of the euro is also legal. This accusation is no longer a soft criticism, it is a real slap in the face. This slap in the face will not have any immediate legal effect, because the CJEU will ignore it and insist that it alone can interpret European contract law, not any national courts, but Karlsruhe has made it very clear here that the CJEU is not the absolute ruler of the European treaties. The accusation against the CJEU is that, through imaginative legal interpretations, it actually creates new EU law, which the nation states have never explicitly agreed to and thus act ultra vires, exceeding its powers. 

 This tendency is certainly justified, because the ECJ never saw itself as a neutral arbitrator between Brussels and the member states, but rather as the motor of the European integration process. He relied on the fact that nobody would ever dare to accuse him of exceeding his mandate. That happened after all. Those for whom the EU has a sacred quality, like the journalists of the Spiegel and the ZEIT, of course immediately rose into a limitless indignation hysteria. A German court dares to criticize the EU and its organs? What sacrilege is pure right-wing populism, if not a preliminary stage to fascism.  Such allegations also show how in the debates in Germany all sense of the right measure has been completely lost in recent years. It is also not surprising that younger German lawyers, who no longer believe that Germany as a state has a legitimate existence, have joined it. It is also not surprising that President of the Bundestag Schäuble describes Karlsruhe's judgment as ""dangerous"" because, he says, it destroys the unity of European law. This is of course a strange assessment, because it is not the resistance from Karlsruhe that is dangerous, but the limitless arrogance of the CJEU lawyers, who followed the maxim ""Necessitas non habet legem"" in the euro crisis without any reservations which the ECB passed over from 2012 is in fact not compatible with the statutes of the central bank. These would have to be changed if this path were to be taken and that would also be the only honest option that would also allow the ECB's decisions to be checked by the European Council. The ECB itself has no mandate for economic policy decisions that it has been making since 2010/12. In the past 10 years it has become a highly political institution, which in no way has a democratic foundation, although a democracy deficit in the case of the EU institutions is almost the normal case again and not the exception. 

 However, let's not kid ourselves, the Karlsruhe ruling will not change anything about the expansion of the euro zone into an unlimited liability community with unlimited monetary government financing. But maybe the ball that Karlsruhe threw into the field will be picked up by others. If Karlsruhe can reject ECJ judgments, why shouldn't other national courts do the same? The results of such resistance against the Luxembourg judges do not have to be found to be gratifying in every case, but in the end the principle applies: if you don't want to hear, you have to feel. Anyone who is no longer accessible to legal arguments must ultimately be countered with radical, quasi system-busting measures, as the British have already done in the form of Brexit. Germany will always lack the courage to do this today, tomorrow and the day after, but countries like Poland may not. One should think about this very carefully in Luxembourg, because for the time being the highest court of the EU still depends on giving its judgments a certain plausibility. For the time being, one cannot rely on force or even violence. The EU does not have the necessary battalions for this.  It applies to the judges of our constitutional court that in the end they will not do much politically with their judgment, but at least they have preserved their self-respect. This also and especially applies to the outgoing President of the Constitutional Court, my Freiburg colleague Andreas Voßkuhle. He behaved, if you will, a little like that Prussian officer, probably one of the Marwitz, the Friedrich the. Große ordered the sacking of the Saxon Castle Hubertusburg in the Seven Years' War in 1761 and refused to do so, saying that such an action was incompatible with oath and honor. In doing so, he saved his honor, but unfortunately Hubertusburg was then looted, albeit by a regiment other than that of Herr v. the Marwitz. This will probably be the case with the ECB's monetary government funding, which the Eurosystem was geared to from the start, but at least one Andreas Voßkuhle and his colleagues will not have been actively involved. So the word of the French King Franz I applies here after his defeat against Emperor Charles V in the Battle of Pavia (1525): Everything is lost, only the honor is not.",,/r/europe/comments/ggzq6q/the_last_rising_up_of_the_federal_constitutional/fq5lpdz/,SamHawkins3,1589110124

In a way Minecraft is THE indie game. It’s what put small game development as serious way to make money on the table. Before that publishers had no big interest in the indie market, because the real money was elsewhere.

Minecraft changed that, publishers started to realize that they could make bank with smaller products as well and started their own indie labels. I mean the indie market was already starting to evolve before that, with things like XBox Indie games for the 360. But it the indie market really got into the public eye after Minecraft made billions and there was a gold rush to create the next one.

edit: I didn't address your point with the motorcycle. Poore &amp; Nemecek calculated the greenhouse gas mitigation potential (see also the correction at the top of the page). The vegan scenario could save ~8 bn. metric tons CO2 (or 8Gt) per year if I understand that correctly. In addition, the UN IPCC 2019 report puts the annual CO2eq avoided in a plant-based world around 8Gt. Both numbers consider a longer time frame (100 years and until 2050, respectively) because they rely on renaturalization of the land currently used to grow feed for livestock, and that land needs time for vegetation to grow before it can absorb CO2 at full capacity.

And people who said that USSR people (now it's s rule to think about Russians while saying USSR, but here is also Ukrainians, Belarussians, Georgian, Armenian, Azerbaijanians, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz,etc.)  are not worthy to thank their contribution and remember it - idiots, because it seems that from your point of view it was better to be looked in gas cameras of nazis or be murdered in another way by your nazi master.

That is a bold statement. I see a lot of commemorations and know a lot of people who are grateful for their sacrifice. Where are you getting your news from?

Well, Soviet Union was allied with Germany and attempted to negotiate a potential entrance into Axis pact. So neither Soviet State can cast a stone. 

When it comes to collaboration, it was more about the leadership of the country than the people, I would say. But there were collaborators among people as well, that is for sure.

U Liku su moji prepreci došli preko Novog Vinodola. Preci moje majke, Kalinići, također su hrvatski plemići iz Novog Vinodola. Moj pradjed stjecajem okolnosti morao je otići u Bosansku krajinu (turska Hrvatska) i tamo se oženio pravoslavnom djevojkom i prešao na pravoslavlje. On je imao isturene prednje zube pa ga je narod prozvao Tesla prema alatki kojom se obrađuje drvo i otud i moje sadašnje prezime Tesla. To je zapravo nadimak. Moj djed je bio časnik u ličkoj regimenti, a moj otac pravoslavni prota!“

He had a diary. 

Krajina, the once Serbian region of Croatia, existed as a Serbian region only from 91. During the time he was born, that area couldn't have been considered to be Serbian. Way before that it was Croatian area. During the time he was born Austria Hungary encouraged anyone to come there, since they needed bodies to defend borders against Ottomans. While Croatia as itself was occupied, it still existed, and it was a distinct teritorry, that had it's own government under Austrian rule, hence kingdom of Croatia and Slavonia a couple of years later.

As I said, I'm not arguing that he is purely a Croat, but thinking of him as just a pure Serb is also kinda disengenous, and it's shoehorning him into one little box.",,/r/europe/comments/ggd391/serbian_and_croatian_soldier_holding_their_arms/fq4ocfh/,why_gaj,1589080431

2920,"&gt;What smaller scales? You ever heard of municipal elections? Or your opinion being cared about? 'It's either a democracy or it's not' is one of the stupidest things about politics I've heard in a while. Is USA a democracy? Elections are most likely rigged, very few people who weren't rich at birth get to any position and it's quite obviously an oligarchy. And yet most people call it a democracy.

I thought this was about whether Yugoslavia under Tito was in any way democratic. What has that got to do with the state of the US democracy?

The most fundamental thing for a country to be considered a democracy is whether it has a viable opposition to the party in power and whether you can vote the party in power out. If you can't - you are not living in a democracy. In most western democracies, however flawed they may be, you can change the party in power by voting. In Tito's Yugoslavia you could not. So it fails the most basic test. The others may be flawed but they can at least be considered democracies, Tito's Yugoslavia can not.

&gt;is one of the stupidest things about politics I've heard in a while

You called Tito a democratic leader so I somehow doubt that.

&gt;You did have to be party approved but everyone had party approval, even if incarcerated before. I don't think I need to explain that much further if you have ever talked to anyone who held a position in SFRY.

Not if you expressed views that were not approved by the party. I never said there was no possibility of rehabilitation, if you renounce your views and toe the party line - sure. But if you decided to stick by your non-communist party views you were not getting anywhere near the power

&gt;I literally said people were incarcerated for all kinds of stupid reasons. And even after that they were allowed everything. I made a mistake about Alija, I'll give you that.

So generous. But not Djilas who wanted to democratise country but was imprisioned and then exiled. Not Seselj who decided to be nationalist and then was imprisoned. Not Perovic or other Serbian liberals who were expelled for having views too liberal for Tito's taste. Not Mesic, Tudjman or members of the Croatian spring who were expelled and imprisoned for nationalism or whatever. You said all views were tolerated within communist party. Putting people in prison and exile for their views kind of indicates the opposite.

&gt;For a modern example, Slavoj Žižek. He left the party in protest. He wasn't kicked or anything even after publishing articles criticizing Tito, militarism and generally politics in Yugoslavia. He is a true marxist, a group of people who were arguably hated by socialist regimes much more than other groups.

So, I listed 10 groups whose views were not tolerated by the communist party, you didn't give me a single example for even one of them but your counter example is the treatment of a marxist communist?

&gt;You have to be fucking kidding me. You want to tell me reality is lying? My great grandfather supported the chetniks (not in any physical way) so after WW2 he was imprisoned and his land was taken. He literally worked his entire life and his posessions in the end were larger than before WW2. He got apologies from many prominent party members (because Yugoslavia parted with Stalinism fully by then). That about not being able to own more than 10 hectares is outright false. When land was mass confiscated (it happened twice, both times early in SFRY) everything more than 10 hectares was taken. You were allowed to own more than 10 hectares. No land was returned during or after the 90's war as far as I'm aware.

Dude, have a look at wikipedia. In 1945 the law limited the maximum of land a person can own to 35 hectares. In 1953 that was reduced to 10ha.

&gt;Illyrian model. Workers elected councils at their workplaces among themselves and they controlled the means of production. Everything was de jure owned by the state but in reality workers had the power over their workplaces in the same way people have power in a country through electing the people in power. Such workplaces competed in a free market. It's not something secret, you know that? There was competition and export and import were controlled by the workers' councils. That is free market. If you think it must be owned by a person who can abuse workers all they want then you're confusing it with capitalism. Capitalism and free market are different things. Also small businesses like shops were everywhere the entire time.

I don't know if your wikipedia is working but this is like the first sentence in the free market entry:

""In economics, a free market is a system in which the prices for goods and services are self-regulated by the open market and by consumers. In a free market, the laws and forces of supply and demand are free from any intervention by a government or other authority and from all forms of economic privilege, monopolies and artificial scarcities""

Does that sound like the SFRJ model prior to 1989 to you?

&gt;When you say 'large enterprises were allowed' you mean 'factories were taken from their workers and given to people genetically and/or politically connected to abuse'.  
&gt;  
&gt;You don't know the difference between communism and socialism. Communism is a stateless, classless society in which everyone gives according to their ability and takes according to their needs. Basically Star Trek system. It's an unachievable ideal. Communism has never been established. Socialism is a system with achieving communism as its goal, according to Lenin.

I did not say they were allowed. I said: ""no medium or large private enterprises were allowed""

The moment when communist parties lost their grip on power is generally referred to as when communism fell, as that was the end of communist ideology and control in their countries. Now, this was about free market vs. state-controlled market so I simply said that there was no free market until communists were gone. It's a simple statement of fact, not sure what that has to do with the Marxist/Leninist theory.

Thanks for the nice comments. I enjoyed our chat as well. I do not agree with some of the details of the genocide claims but recognise it as such and see the denial of it as a barrier to total discussion of the historic era and better relations with many countries.

&gt;That being said, what does a grafiti in a German city and the barbaric murder of non-Turkish Moslems in New Zealand to do with this matter? What purpose does it have to be mentioned here?

I apologise for that comparison though because while the dude might have killed non-Turks, his manifesto, decorations on weaponry etc. indicated a very specific de-Turkification objective especially of those very same areas that was our subject for chat.

So my attempt was not to try and tie global right-wing terrorism, a xenophobic graffiti and your edgy provocations as your per your words but to showcase how a joke about turning back some lands to Armenia is not comparable to the spat between Germany and France if it exists today, the jokes about that calls back to a recent bloodshed made in the name of that objective (among other things) in a way that even islamic terror has not; since islamic terror does not aim the return of German land in France for example to Germany.

However in my limited perspective I failed to truly assess the impact of terrorism in Europe as well which has been truly horrendous.

I think it boils down to expecting the worst of the person across the internet, for me to say ''this isn't funny'' one has to assume the intention to be nefarious which I also did and took your provocative comments to be pointedly malevolent. You clearly showed that wasn't case with your follow up comments and while I am not sure on the lack of humour and butthurt side of things it truly shows I'm on edge about stuff like this as many are but it should not be so.

In full agreement with your closing paragraphs, I also hope for peace and calm finally in our region. It would be lovely if the picture showed a culturally significant mountain either in a sharing agreement or open to Armenian tourists and visitors for example.

2958,"I'm actually italian and I've attended a game design course at uni and I can confirm, most folks here looking for a job in the game industry just look outside the border. Gaming has caught on very late here, I remember not a lot of years ago it was still considered a social stigma and stuff for nerds and neckbeards, while real dudebros spent time with girls and scooters and football and whatever. This has changed really fast in the last few years, now you actually see the ""cool guys"" buying a console and spending their evenings playing with their friends and even girlfriends, but it's also meant we've missed an entire generation of game developers because most computer science nerds just looked for a job in IT or straight up emigrated. It's kinda the same for other computer science industries as well, but the only big one that is nearly completely missing is gaming I'd say. There are some big companies that have studios here, but it's usually very small scale stuff. Most local gaming companies are either indie studios in their early days, or side studios from big companies that make crappy mobile games.. it's not a random occurrence that most famouse italian games are mobile (some of which are really big, like 2048 or Candy Crush itself, or at least, King was founded by an Italian guy), we didn't really have a widespread gaming culture here and a lot of devs (myself included) approached games after starting out as mobile devs or coming from other industries to mobile gaming only because of the easy money and not because of passion or vocation.

TL;DR I don't know if this is my perception, but the culture here tends to adapt really slowly to technology and change even among younger people, so the stigma that ""gaming is for nerds"" stuck with our society until very recently, discouraging young people from dedicating themselves to this career and older people from investing actual money into big projects.",,/r/europe/comments/ggmfwy/popular_video_games_developed_in_europe_oc/fq460io/,xevizero,1589074012

The media sensationalises things to get a reaction from people. When the reality is quite different. The hospitals in New York were not overwhelmed and so they were able to prepare for it. 

&gt;It's not an overreaction. 

The more that is known about it, the more that does look like that way and if anything it is making the problem worse. The easiest way out of this is to reach natural immunity and lockdowns prevent that as well as high costs attached to them. The IFR looks like it is actual quite low, with this virus posing a low risk to the overwhelming majority of the population as such it seems like the wrong course of action to try and suppress it.

&gt;The lockdown is in place to protect those of us who don't want to get sick or die 

Well about 99.97% of people won’t die from it and it is destroying the economy as well as robbing people of their freedoms. There is also little evidence that they are that effective. With in the case of a lot of places the infection has already been spreading for some time.

&gt;Experts are saying this is the only way to prevent thousands of unnecessary deaths.

There also isn’t much good evidence that they do with plenty of plenty of places reaching their epidemic peaks before the time that the lockdown are supposedly meant to have their effect.

3023,"The Swallow's Nest is a decorative castle located in Gaspra, a small spa town between Yaltaand Alupka, in the Crimean Peninsula. It was built between 1911 and 1912, on top of the 40-metre (130 ft) high Aurora Cliff, in a Neo-Gothic design by the Russian architect Leonid Sherwood for the Baltic German businessman Baron von Steingel.

The castle overlooks the Cape of Ai-Todor on the Black Sea coast and is located near the remains of the Roman castrum of Charax. The Swallow's Nest is one of the most popular visitor attractions in Crimea, having become the symbol of Crimea's southern coastline.

The building is compact in size, measuring only 20 m (66 ft) long by 10 m (33 ft) wide. Its original design envisioned a foyer, guest room, stairway to the tower, and two bedrooms on two different levels within the tower. The interior of the guest room is decorated with wooden panels; the walls of the rest of the rooms are stuccoed and painted. An observation deck rings the building, providing a view of the sea, and Yalta's distant shoreline.

The first building on the Aurora Cliff was constructed for a Russian general circa 1895. The first structure he built was a wooden cottage romantically named the ""Castle of Love."" Later on, the ownership of the cottage passed to A. K. Tobin, a court doctor to the Russian Tsar.

In 1911, Baron von Steingel, a Baltic German noble who had made a fortune extracting oil in Baku, acquired the timber cottage and within a year had it replaced with the current building called Schwalbennest. The Scots Baronial and Moorish Revival styles had been introduced in the Crimea in the 1820s by Edward Blore, the architect of the Vorontsov Palace (1828–46). Compared to the Alupka and Koreiz palaces, the Swallow's Nest is closer in style to various German fairy-tale inspired castle follies, such as Lichtenstein Castle, Neuschwanstein Castle and Stolzenfels Castle, although its precarious seaside setting on the cliffs draws parallels with the Belém Tower in Portugal, or Miramare Castle on the Gulf of Trieste outside Trieste, Italy.

In 1914, von Steingel sold the building to P. G. Shelaputin to be used as a restaurant. For a short time after the 1917 Russian Revolution, the building was used only as a tourist attraction. In 1927, the Swallow's Nest survived a serious earthquake rated at 6 to 7 on the Richter scale.  The building was not damaged apart from some small decorative items that were thrown into the sea along with a small portion of the cliff. However, the cliff itself developed a huge crack. In the 1930s, the building was used by a reading club from the nearby ""Zhemchuzhina"" (Pearl) resort, however it was closed shortly thereafter as a safety precaution due to the damage it had suffered in the quake, remaining closed for the next 40 years.

Renovation and restoration of the building was started only in 1968. The project involved the restoration of a small portion of the castle and the addition of a monolithic console concrete plate to strengthen the cliff. Since 1975, a restaurant has operated within the building. 

Owing to its important status as the symbol of the Crimea's southern coast, the Swallow's Nest was featured in several Soviet films. It was used as the setting of Desyat Negrityat, the 1987 Soviet screen version of Agatha Christie's And Then There Were None. The building was also featured in the 1983 Soviet-Polish children's film Mister Blot's Academy as well as in Mio in the Land of Faraway, a 1987 joint production by Swedish, Norwegian, and Soviet film companies.",,/r/europe/comments/ggpwsh/swallows_nest_at_night_time_in_gaspra_crimea/fq3gdqh/,8mckenzie,1589066171

Truth is, Germans were not bothered to the point of fighting back. And I can understand why. It's hard to go against the current, especially when the doctrine it's favourable and makes you think you're some kind of special race.

Contrasting the examples provided, a mandated refugee quota would be in line with the EU's professed values (right to asylum + tackling problems as a bloc rather than leaving Member States to fend for themselves), whereas scaling back religious freedoms or other personal rights would actively go against them.

The EU as an idea is inherently progressive, on multiple levels. If that's not to everyone's taste, then they don't want the EU but something different. It's like arguing that Americans worshipping the Confederate flag are still in support of the US rather than trying to subvert it and turn it into something else, just because they still have US citizenship.

3242,"3 short sentences stating related facts about the declaration previously mentioned and on topic can hardly be described as a rant. If you want to bring up inferring hostility where there is none, your reaction would be the first example in this exchange. 

&gt;The Schuman declaration, per the person you responded to, is a significant historical event for the EU and people who are invested in the foundation of the EU. No matter how involved the UK was and is in the European Union, it's never been something that the British public is attached to in any big way.

The UK was invested in the foundation of the EU, that is the point. Even outside it, it is invested in its existence and its continuance. 

&gt; and barely celebrated its holidays even when they were a member.

Europe Day has barely been celebrated throughout the EU's history, it only became a Europe wide thing in the last 15 years, and it is generally overshadowed by other celebrations around the same time as it even then. Again, the UK is not alone in that. 

&gt;He's asked why Brits would know about a historical event that led to the founding of a political body they never paid much attention to and it's a completely fair question.

And my response was that Britain had a founding role in the political events and has paid attention to the body that created it. Anyone with a passing knowledge of the history of modern Britain since WW2 or Thatcher would know it definitely *has* paid attention to it and its relationship has been intimate if sometimes fraught.

&gt;A lot of people from more pro-EU countries don't know about it, so why would the UK?

3249,"Lockheed did not develop Block 60.  UAE paid an unsustainable amount of money to get modifications for their F-16s that would make no sense if it wasn't a political bribe. 

Block 70 is just a few changes to the aircraft of which the most important one - AN/APG-80 - is made by Northrop Grumman and was paid for with UAE money during the Block 60 R&amp;D. It's an upgrade package for older C variants since the only thing that Lockheed did develop was SLEP to extend airframe life.

The EW system that they developed for the V is still having issues. But it's a hush hush subject because you pay for it and have to constantly work on it.

There is a reason why they still struggle with the F-35 and why their primary defense is a continuing PR campaign in the media and in Congress.

Lockheed is in the business of screwing government out of taxpayer money, not in the business of making reliable and efficient combat systems.

&gt;Air Forces like Israel and the US used the F-16 in both AA and A2G warfare. I wouldn't call the two Iraq wars counter-insurgency operations and the Israelis bombed a nuclear reactor in Bagdad, so there's plenty of combat experience.

Then Bulgaria should buy Bf109 then because they have even more combat experience. Or just stick to MiG-21s because they have the most combat experience of any jet.

F-16s have most combat experience as simple bombers dropping bombs on insurgents.  During the Gulf War the main air-to-air fighter was F-15. During the Iraq War there was barely any fighting done in the air.  F-16s have most combat done in the IDF but that ended in the 80s. The raid on Osirak had F-16As carrying bombs and F-15As providing escort.   F-16s have never fought peer adversary in their current state of development. It's an aircraft 45 years in service and 20 years out of date so the argument that it is somehow more capable because of ""combat experience"" is exactly like the thing I wrote above.

&gt; I'm not trying to downplay the effort by Saab developing the Gripen; they have a history of capable aircraft. but in a real-world environment, the Viper was a lot more successful. how much of that was possible due to shady policies is everybody's guess

All of it.  

Since Gripen's introduction not a single deal won by the F-16 was a clean deal won by a better plane or a better offer.

Literally none. Every time Gripen was offered Americans started their arm-twisting and bullying immediately ""buy American *or else*...""  The only reason why Czechs and Hungarians got their Gripens is because they threatened to dismantle air forces altogether and got them as lease. Because that was something Lockheed or USAF were not willing to do.

Brazil bought Gripens because of technology transfer that neither Lockheed nor Boeing could not provide and Gripen was better than Rafale to Americans.

Today, I firmly believe, what we have done with our region is beyond disaster. I am not trying to say Ottomans had to continue, but within Ottomans, we carved out religious, ethnic racist small countries who are useless.

She wasn't allowed to talk about it either. There are many stories like this.

2. It was, at least in some way, an admission of guilt. Most people were quite ordinary and no monsters on a personal level.

3274,"&gt;That would possibly be acceptable if the rest of humanity did the same but it's Europe that's suffering. 

Why would what the rest of the world is doing change whether or not Europe could take care of its elderly amid declining populations? I don’t agree with the term “suffering”. Do you mean it generally speaking or strictly in terms of how to sustain retirement and health care systems?

&gt;a huge dearth in our population will without a shadow of a doubt cause a massive economical downward spiral that would be impossible to pull itself out of since each individual young person would have up to 6 people to support (parents and grandparents). This would end the possiibility of a high QoL if that's your goal. 

Reducing the economic output is the point! It’s not population that’s the problem - it’s overall economic output. You can either be prosperous and few or poor and many. In my view, later this century this will sort itself out anyway - at the cost of enormous human suffering and this planet’s biosphere for the foreseeable future.

Voluntarily reigning in breeding seems infinitely more preferable to me.

As for retirement, I don’t buy that. We’re prosperous and productive enough to contemplate things like UBI or whatever. Housing, clothing, feeding and medically caring for a large number  (proportionally speaking) of old people really shouldn’t be a problem. A significant proportion of the declining economic output would have to be dedicated to it - but so what.

Back then there were thousands of tourists in Ischgl, no social distancing or lockdown in place, bars and clubs were open (good luck trying to keep a 2m distance in there) and european countries did not take the whole thing as serious as they do now. 
By now the virus is largely contained in Luxembourg, restaurants, cafes and m1ost stores are closed. People are only allowed to leave the house for necessary things and you can only hang out with the people from your household. Those measures have been in place for almost 2 moths and the governement has (re)started contact tracing. The probability that anyone entering Germany is infected is thus rather small. It is not like the people entering Germany could spread the virus like it happened in Ischgl anyway because in germany there are social distancing measures in place aswell. I am guessing the people crossing mostly want to visit their friends and family who live across the border.
Most experts and the WHO (for what it's worth) claim that border closings do not really stop the virus.

You had your own budget and you were just throwing money like there is no tomorrow, and they you are surprised that no one wants to lend you any more money. Do you understand that if greece didnt cheat when entering the eurozone, you would have hard bakruptcy. Most of the money coming to greece went to your pension funds etc... and now decades later you still play this victim game, like you have no responsibility for this situation. This is so ridiculous. What kind of argument is it, that you dont have private sector, because there was war 75 years ago? Like people of greece could not start their own business? Stop pretending that you are that much better than other balkan countries and accept the reality, that you are not doing that much better than them, and start from there. Like they have to as well. There is absolutelly no reason why should germany pay wages for your people in offices drinking coffee and pretending that they work. Germany has balanced budget for quite some time, they were also hit by a war and east was hit by USSR. Because in germany most people dont work in public sector or renting own house with not paying any taxes and all of this nonsense that has been quite popular in greece for some time now.

Just constant bullshit. You clearly did not understand what i fucking said. What i'm saying is that Greeks **DIDN'T** want Europe to pay any more money for Greece.

In 1850 Greece joined the Crimean war in an attempt to scape its lenders and failed, it was rewarded for its treason to pay war reparations with more loans. It took until 1870 to pay off the debts.

3454,"&gt;The war is over now for 75 years. 

Unable to understand the lasting effects war has. 75 years is nothing. 

&gt; It's not ottomans fault that half of the nation was working in public sector.

Unable to understand how the mass destruction of 80% of our industries would lead to big number of people working in the public sector cause there is no plethora of privately owned corporations or other non-government agencies.


&gt; What do you expect, when half of the nation works in public sector with big wages and the other half doesn't pay taxes? That this will work forever?

Also, you are doing plenty of talking without providing much of anything regarding sources to prove that what you are saying is valid.

Now let's discuss something else as well. Why do you think the big issue Greeks currently have with the EU is the austerity measures that we were forced to implement through TROIKA? 

Is it because we **don't** want to eventually be able to be in a position were we can start repaying our debt or is it because we **do** want to repay our debt but we are aware that the measures being implemented are gonna basically make it impossible to not only be in a position to repay but basically ruin any potential future of our economy recovering.

Let's look at National Debt among EU countries. 

https://www.statista.com/statistics/274179/national-debt-in-eu-countries/

Interesting right, the enormous amounts of debts countries like Germany, France , Belgium, Netherlands have. (i'm mentioning these countries specifically because they are supposedly so better off than Greece, which they are. But not because they owe less money)

Basically these countries economies are booming so much that their huge amounts of debt are considered ""sustainable"", which mind you , doesn't mean that they will at any point in the foreseeable future be repaid. But their economies are operating at such a capacity were their debt is considered ""sustainable debt"". 

Greece's debt due to the economy collapsing became unsustainable, so how does a country's debt go from being unsustainable back to being sustainable? 

Option A: We Loan that now insolvent state the biggest amount of money to **ever** be loaned to a country (which again, it was all loaned to repay private banks not be used for Greece's improvement) while at the same time applying such asphyxiating measures to their economy as for it to shrink to a point were it will  never been in a situation were the huge amounts of debt will ever become sustainable again and the loans won't be able to be repaid...ever. 

**OR**

Option B : We restructure the debt by agreeing to a new deal with the banks which the money were owed too, allowing Greece a more workable deal in order for us to be able to get our economy back up to a good enough state (by reduction of tax rates and budget surplus targets as to attract investors to invest in the country) ,  thus for the money to be able to be eventually given back to the loaners and for the debt to become sustainable.

3466,"Again, this wasn't even about the time of this castle but about the possibility of dragging stuff/artillery into the mountains (the quote in question was not medieval). 

But to inspect your Agincourt example. It's mentioned to be ""horses for combat."" So you're talking about heavy, high quality battle steeds. Not mules or old horses used in the country side but the best of the best available horses. Horses that would not carry anything but their rider and maybe some of his armour on the march. Way too valuable to risk any injury or exhaustion. 

Even then, it's 1500 horses for 9000 Englishmen (and Welsh) to use the highest estimate. So a 1:6 ratio. And this is for one battle. The French would also have had many more horses.

Compare that to WW1. The British Army had 3,8million soldiers at the end of 1918. Fighting all over the place. 484,000 horses lost, or maybe up to 2million in total. That's a ratio of 1:8 or 1:2. And this is includes all the horses used in transporting and is for a 4 year conflict. A conflict where horses (now including the less desirable ones) were worth less than men. Also England had by now become a country with quite a bit more focus on horsemanship and breeding than in the hundred years war. A period with lots of wars which probably didn't exactly help with the availability of quality horses. Especially as they relied on import at the time, often from French regions. 

All of this is also excluding mules. Which are what would be used for any mountain climbing as horses aren't made for that. Mules are much simpler in upkeep than war steeds. 

But again, not even really relevant, just interested how the numbers would compare between Agincourt and WW1.",,/r/europe/comments/ggatrv/maglič_fortress_built_by_1250_ad_one_of_the_most/fq0ubis/,Heimerdahl,1589037745

So planting two decades of trees isn't going to do shit against enemy tank battalions.

Nazis were genocidal maniacs, who lived with their idea of Lebensraum in the East and they already showed themselves utterly ruthless, capable of horrible atrocities.

It really is not at all far-fetched to imagine that they would in fact exterminate either directly or indirectly through forced labour a large portion of the population living in the areas that were covered by Generalplan Ost.

And even if it was that they decided to spare Estonians, because they would deem you fit enough for germanization, is that really the line you want to take - ""oh, it wouldn't have been so bad, they would have only killed the Slavs and not us, we would only be displaced"".

The german government has better things to do right now, than to spend their time doing meaningless politic theaters. They are spending their time doing exactly what they need to do right now.

&gt;You mean like the virus that the CCP knowingly sent to you or the economic effects of it?

Couldn't care less. You're pushing his agenda.

&gt; However, he has gotten very good results and is very good about keeping his campaign promises.

Sure, very good results. 80000 citizens dead, more than a million infected, and your infections are still going strong every single day.

I've literally defended the entire government (including her) in their response to the crisis. Learn to read.

&gt;Again, what was Merkel doing to fight the virus in January when trump was forming a virus task force and banning flights from China.

Well, here's the thing. While Trump had to form a virus task-force in January. Germany had their equivalent ready since 2001. Congrats on Trump banning flights by the way, just sucks that your still orders of magnitude more fucked than we ever were. Good luck.

&gt;What is your opinion of Merkel demonizing Trump for banning flights from China and latter Europe and then following his lead?

There are many things about communism that strongly feed into authoritarianism which in turn results into a different system.    

And yeah I consider them a glimpse because even if they were far from their ideal they were much closer to it than anyone else so it's logical that going further in that direction would result in something more similar to say socialist Poland than to Australia or Japan.   In Europe too there's definitely a correlation between the gradient of socialism with it getting stronger to the East Yugoslavia -&gt; Warsaw Pact -&gt; USSR and the degree of oppression.

&gt;You should also understand that politically sensitive topics are filled to the brim with propagandists. (Money are there.)

And you should realize that I'm very much capable of distinguishing the two by simply looking at the methodology and procedures of said studies.

Confirmed  cases and deaths per population size are plotted on a log scale.  Countries are shown from the date where there are more than 1000  confirmed cases.

The % deaths  among the confirmed cases is a crude estimator of the ""case fatality  rate"" the proportion of positively tested that die. In an ongoing  epidemic this estimator is however biased because some of the positively  tested will die in the future. The animation shows a trend that the  ratio in general increases over time. This is expected because the  deaths occurs with a time lag. Between country differences in the case  fatality rate estimates can have several causes: e.g., different age  structures, health systems and different testing strategies and  frequencies.

Note that direct between country comparisons of death counts must take into account the differences in the way death are registered (e.g. only  hospital deaths or all deaths, people dying with or because of the  diseases, confirmed or probable cases).",,/r/europe/comments/ggcb1s/covid19_confirmed_cases_and_deaths_in_europe_per/fpzbaca/,n3ongrau,1589015994

The Communist Party of Russia sought a three-meter statue of Joseph Stalin, which was sold by Komárov in Central Bohemia. Party chairman Maxim Suraykin wanted to place her in front of the Czech embassy in Moscow to remind the Czechs who saved them from fascism. Although the leadership of the village contacted fifteen interested parties, most of whom had Russian surnames, they canceled the auction and the statue eventually went to the local museum.

The three-meter-high sandstone statue of Stalin was the dominant feature of Komarov's Peace Square for almost the entire duration of the communist regime in Czechoslovakia. However, she has been standing in the depository for thirty years now, with an offended shoe on her left leg and a coat flap.

This year, the councilors of Komárov decided to solve the fate of the unwanted memory of the previous regime. In April, they offered the statue for sale for a minimum amount of 20,000 crowns, with the one who makes the highest bid getting it.

As the daily [Aktuálně.cz](https://Aktuálně.cz) found out, 15 people showed interest, more than half of them had a Russian name. Who specifically wanted the statue, however, the management of the town, which has about 2,400 inhabitants, declined to say. The deputy mayor of the village, Radim Šíma, justified this by protecting personal data.

Some time ago, however, Maxim Suraykin, chairman of the Communist Party of Russia, declared his interest in the statue in the Russian media. He said at the time that he planned to transfer the work of art to Russia, and at the same time wanted to ask the Moscow authorities if the statue could not stand near the Czech embassy. ""If she stood before the Czech embassy, ​​she would forever remind these gentlemen who protected them from the fascist threat and to whom they should be so grateful,"" said the chairman of the party, which currently has no deputies in the State Duma.

Suraykin, who ended up penultimate in Russia's presidential election with 0.68 percent of the vote in 2018, came up with the idea at a time when Russia is outraged that Prague 6 has decided to remove the monument to Soviet Marshal Ivan Konev.

Suraykin himself, as a member of the Ulyanovsk Regional Parliament, proposed that, as a retaliatory step, the memorial of 90 Czechoslovak legionaries be removed, which was unveiled here in 2015. ""It would be Russia's response to the cynical and disgusting dismantling of Marshal Konev's monument by the Prague authorities on the eve of the 75th anniversary of the Great Victory,"" Suraykin said.

The statue remains in the region

Even if the Russian side really cares about the Komarov statue of Stalin and offers the highest amount, it will certainly not travel to Moscow. In the end, the envelopes with the offers were not opened at the municipal office. Councilors canceled the demand procedure after the deadline.

They decided to transfer the statue to the collection of the Museum of the Czech Karst. ""The museum appealed to us to keep the statue in the region, because it is a regional monument,"" says Deputy Mayor Šíma.

The director of the museum, Karin Kriegerbeck, confirms that the main effort of the museum is to preserve the statue for future generations. ""The sculpture has its regional historical significance. It documents a certain period of time. Its history is well described, so it belongs to the regional museum,"" explains the director.

However, it is not yet clear whether the locals will be allowed to see the statue again freely after thirty years. According to the director, it will remain in the depository and at the moment it is premature to talk about how the museum will use it.

""We are continuously exhibiting a lot of other objects and keeping them in the depository again. This may be the case with this statue as well, but getting it is fresh information, so I won't tell you anything more about it at the moment,"" the director adds.

Foundry workers worked on the statue for one whole shift for free

The founders of the foundry in the Buzuluk company decided to make the statue in 1949. ""Its employees plus the surrounding peasantry worked for the statue for one whole shift for free,"" describes the history of the statue's deputy, Deputy Mayor Šíma. Its author was Jan Jiříkovský and it was unveiled in the square in July 1951 with the participation of uniformed soldiers and the then chairman of the National Assembly and a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia Oldřich John.

However, about two years before the Velvet Revolution, reservations about the statue began to emerge over the publication of Soviet crimes under Stalin's leadership, as reported by a Czechoslovak television report from 1989. After the revolution, these voices intensified and the first Christmas after the fall of the regime was covered. In January 1990, at a meeting of the local national committee and the Civic Forum, it was decided to remove it.

The statue was until now in the depository. According to Deputy Mayor Šíma, the town began to think about selling the statue about five years ago, when a collector from Rakovnicko, who runs a private museum, showed interest in it. ""He wanted to buy it from us, but we didn't know what the value of the statue could be. For about five years we looked for experts, we approached them with clouds. Some promised to come and see, but when they realized it was a statue of Stalin , so they did not come, ""describes Šíma.

The expert has only been found now. He calculated the value of the statue at 20 thousand crowns. At that moment, the village management announced that it was selling the statue. According to the deputy mayor, it is more of a coincidence that the sale took place at a time when the statue of Marshal Konev was removed in Prague.

Just as a new monument - in this case reminiscent of the liberation of Prague - is planned to be built on the Interbrigade Square instead of a statue of a Soviet military leader, so a new monument has appeared on the Peace Square in Komarov. Since 1991, there has been a cast-iron column with the figure of an eagle and the emblem of the Kingdom of Bohemia, which was created in the Komárov ironworks in 1891 on the occasion of the Jubilee Provincial Exhibition in Prague.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/ggaud4/russians_wanted_to_put_the_statue_of_stalin_in/fpys2ae/,adelkaloc,1589008459

Anyways, Im just explaining the geopolitical realities and these apply to any large nation in the world currently, applied in the past, and will apply in the future. For Russia having NATO set up shop so close to its borders is akin to them or China setting up missles in Canada or Mexico. Imagine how the states would react to that. In fact there’s a precedent when the Soviet Union tried to put a missile on ally Cuba and the US almost started a nuclear war. Also you have to keep in mind Russia’s has a history of getting invaded from its western border and is obviously hell bent on ensuring that doesn’t happen again. 

What Russia does is the same and definitely less violent than what the US does on a large scale world wide. Germany even ensures that the other EU countries’ market’s remain open for their large corporations. If you want to address this issue you want to call out everyone and see who are the worst abusers.

I also understand the substantive argument against this system, and I am in no way saying that this is a blanket solution to a very complicated problem. I did this for two reasons:

1.) To look at what a viable alternative among many that could be used to reform this broken system of seat distribution could look like, knowing well that there is many other factors to take into account.
2.) I've always wondered what it would look like personally in this alternative situation.

I know what you're talking about and how you could screw over smaller nations with this system, and I do understand those points. Certainly in my country, Ireland, this system is used a lot by politicians to kind of forget rural communities because their problems are too costly for such a small population over such a large area of land, especially when it comes to necessities, like broadband. I understand where you are coming from, and I'm not saying that this will be easy, or that it is a blanket solution to such a complex problem, but that this could be a possible viable alternative among many. Maybe you could even take a few points or two from this system and mix it with a few other systems and work with that.

* What they already spend on Medicare/Medicaid/other programs, which is around $1500B (1500B + 300B / 330M = $5600 per citizen, which is around the same as Germany's healthcare expenditure)
* Reducing healthcare costs - administrative costs with billing/collections, actually negotiating drug prices with pharma companies, tightening regulations on hospital pricing and/or having actual public hospitals, removing or greatly reducing the importance of insurance companies and other middlemen, etc.
* A tax increase to cover anything that's still missing. Overall this would actually be a positive or, at worst, neutral since businesses wouldn't be paying for insurance, people wouldn't be paying deductibles/copays/yada yada

Of course this would not be simple to implement and would take time. But the result would be a system that is fairer and cheaper overall.

Regional wise, the region Trier of Germany ranks first of taking in immigrants at the rate of 23.4, as the provinces Agri, Kars, Igdir, Ardahan of Turkey rank first of giving away emigrants at the rate of 26.5.

[Gestapo–NKVD conferences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestapo%E2%80%93NKVD_conferences)

*The Gestapo–NKVD conferences were a series of security police meetings organised in late 1939 and early 1940 by Germany and the Soviet Union, following the invasion of Poland in accordance with the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. The meetings enabled both parties to pursue specific goals and aims as outlined independently by Hitler and Stalin, with regard to the acquired, formerly Polish territories. The conferences were held by the Gestapo and the NKVD officials in several Polish cities. In spite of their differences on other issues, both Heinrich Himmler and Lavrentiy Beria had similar objectives as far as the fate of the prewar Poland was concerned.*

*According to several sources, one of the results of this conference was the German Ausserordentliche Befriedungsaktion (see: German AB Action operation in Poland), elimination of Krakow intelligentsia Sonderaktion Krakau and the Soviet Katyn massacre.*",Lithuania,/r/europe/comments/gfppdl/baltic_presidents_condemn_russias_attempts_to/fpyg8fi/,PB_Kolekcionierius,1589003387

4002,"&gt; we British have outrageously mismanaged our waters and dumped nuclear waste into the Irish Sea

The hubris of European nations of the early 20th century is not comparable to the past 50 years of mismanagement in the face of overwhelming scientific census. Nuclear waste dumping into the ocean is also not really a significant ecological force, its actually incredibly safe. I suggest you research upon the impacts of the Fukushima incident upon the fishing industry - it returned to normality by 2015. And the dumping in the Irish sea has been incredibly minimal in comparison.

&gt; Well mate, I haven't voted for Brexit yet.

That makes 2.

&gt; Edit: Huh, apparently the Med is tied for first with the Black Sea.

According to the GFCM publication The State of Mediterranean and Black Sea Fisheries 2016 (FAO, 2016l), about 80 percent of the stocks scientifically assessed in the Mediterranean and Black Sea are not sustainably exploited.

But this is an admission that the EU will be shaken if China deals pressure and money to an organization called the EU. It's certainly a difficult choice, and maybe they thought it was better overall because the censorship of the deletion of one sentence would remain in a separate report.

However, we have to make them understand that even if China does eventually take control of the media in this case, it will take a tremendous amount of time to get rid of the facts. This kind of pressure only makes the impression on China worse, and no one wins. Therefore, the EU should not have agreed to the removes, rather than a wavering attitude as an excuse.

More to the point, if it is multilateralism, even more so if one country has great power and can control another, then it is not multilateralism, it is a master-slave relationship.

This time, by agreeing to remove it, China will have gotten a taste of it. The pressure will be on next problem too. And EU may have to bend beliefs again.

4095,"The monument was erected following a devastating outbreak in 1679. In the Bulletin of the History of Medicine, epidemiologist Edward A. Eckert writes that in Austria it was “referred to as the Great Plague” with Vienna reporting 60,000 burials, “about half” of the city’s inhabitants.

While the fourteenth-century Black Death pandemic was the most fatal of the plague outbreaks, the disease would recur over the following centuries, including in Vienna. In 1679, the density of the city, the lack of any public sewers, and the refuse that encouraged an infestation of rats all contributed to a terrible epidemic. Available treatments were limited to bloodletting, induced vomiting, and the most basic of care, administered by the Brotherhood of the Holy Trinity religious order; large pits were excavated and heaped with the dead.

In *Reviews of Infectious Diseases*, medical history scholars Boris Velimirovic and Helga Velimirovic cite this account:

&gt;Pains and suffering were heightened when each went out of the path of his friend, even blood relatives could not visit or help one another in their need…often the seven gates of the city were not enough to carry out the sick and the dead…bearers became fewer, and the drum was beaten daily to hire others, for increased pay…because of the lack of bearers of the sick, prisons were opened and prisoners, even persons incarcerated for life, were forced to the gruesome task.

When this harrowing time finally ended, the city felt as if it had been divinely saved. Soon, a lavish monument would rise to remember those who died and give thanks for those who survived.

4141,"By claiming that capitalism’s failures are reasons to try communism, you are inherently being hypocritical. If this is true, then the failures of communism are reasons to try capitalism. 

When judging an ideology, you judge it by its own merits and nothing else. No failures of capitalism are arguments of communism’s success, they are just failures of capitalism. 

So I ask, ignore capitalism. Judge communism by its own merits. Not what Marx wrote about it, not what it could be if done “properly,” not what is wrong with other ideologies, but actual examples of communism’s long term success. 

The point being: Communism is abundant with examples of its failures and hyper limited in examples of its success. Majority, if not all, of said success is short term.

If you want to defend communism, you are defending every part of it. Because, whether you agree with it or not, the ideology has not panned out for the betterment of its people in the long run in all significant examples. 

If you want to play the “it works, it just hasn’t been done right” card... then capitalism is still the logical choice. Capitalism successes are far more abundant than communisms, regardless of both of their failures. So if communism, an ideology rife with failures that have lead to people’s deaths and economic failures, could be done “better...” Then the same could be said about capitalism. All “what if’s” arguments are to be applied equally. 

The above argument is actually a perfect argument for capitalism. Because although it has seen success, the rise of lobbying and corporate power (crony capitalism) has given way to a power shift away from the people and towards companies. It could be done better. But, “what if’s” are not good arguments regardless so this is a moot point.",,/r/europe/comments/geer4s/the_estonian_institute_of_historical_memory/fpxqdhq/,Snarfdaar,1588987457

When it comes to Generalplan Ost, the plan for Baltics was twofold: double their sizes by appropriating land from Russia, and displace half the native population to newly added territories. Notably: no extermination. Second part: start slowly settling now less densely populated countries with German settlers. It'd have added up to about 500k Germans in two decades, about quadruple the amount that had relocated _from_ the Baltics after the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact while the Nazis and Soviets were still buddies.

From time to time a company goes bankrupt, and the people become unemployed, that's normal. Suppose you only have the employees of four companies who participate in a social security system. That means the employees of those other three companies will now have to pay the unemployment benefits of those of the other company's employees until they find work. That's a very heavy burden. But if there are a hundred companies' employees in the system, that's a lot easier. And if the entire country is in it, just one company going bankrupt isn't even noticeable. That's what robustness means.

Local government levels exist to respond to locally different conditions, and to leverage knowledge of local situations.

4393,"**Text of Times article by Bruno Waterfield, Brussels | Didi Tang, Beijing:**


The European Union has been humiliated for the second time in two weeks after accepting Chinese censorship of a letter mentioning that the coronavirus outbreak originated in China.

EU ambassadors had written an opinion piece celebrating Sino-European co-operation to mark the 45th anniversary of diplomatic relations.

Despite the glowing terms of the article, published in China Daily, a state-run newspaper, the Chinese foreign ministry demanded that a reference to the origins of the coronavirus pandemic be cut before publication.

The opinion piece noted that the “outbreak of the coronavirus in China, and its subsequent spread to the rest of the world over the past three months, has meant that our pre-existing plans have been temporarily side-tracked”, in a reference to a postponed EU-China summit.

The Chinese foreign ministry refused publication unless the words were deleted, and with “considerable reluctance” the EU’s diplomatic service, the European External Action Service (EEAS), agreed in order to ensure that publication went ahead, to the dismay of some governments.


“It is regrettable that part of the sentence about the spread of the virus has been edited,” Nicolas Chapuis, the EU’s ambassador to Beijing, said. He declined to comment on why China had asked for the words to be removed.

China is locked in a war of words with President Trump over the US’s handling of the pandemic and is opposing EU efforts to build a compromise at the United Nations World Health Assembly this month because its resolution refers to the virus’s origin in the central Chinese city of Wuhan.

Beijing is a key economic partner as well as a rival to European countries, and the EU is trying to deepen its connections and take advantage of the worsening US relationship with China.

The article concludes that “the world needs the co-operation of Europe and China” on “climate action, peace and security, sustainable development and upholding the multilateral global order”, all areas of tension with the US.

Norbert Röttgen, a senior Christian Democrat and head of the German parliament’s foreign affairs committee, expressed his shock at the glowing tone of the article and acceptance of censorship, and said that the EEAS had to stand up for European political values.

“I am shocked not once but twice,” he said. “First the EU ambassadors generously adopt Chinese narratives and then on top of that the EU representation accepts Chinese censorship of the joint op-ed. Speaking with one voice is important, but it has to reflect our shared European values and interests.”

The EEAS said: “The EU delegation was informed that publication could only take place with agreement of [the] Chinese ministry of foreign affairs.

“The EU delegation made known its concerns. The EU continues to advocate a free press. On this specific case the EU delegation decided to proceed with publication with considerable reluctance as it considered it important to communicate the key messages.”

There is anger among ambassadors who had signed the letter but were not told of the censorship or consulted on the changes to the text, which was published in their names. “We regret that pressure of time prevented advance consultation with member states on this occasion,” an internal EEAS email seen by Buzzfeed News said.

The episode is embarrassing for the EEAS because it had censored its own report to remove references to an official Chinese “global disinformation” campaign over the pandemic.

Leaked emails show that senior advisers to Josep Borrell, the EU’s foreign affairs chief and the head of the EEAS, delayed the report’s publication and removed “key findings” because of “heavy pushback” from China.

China is trying to block EU efforts to build a UN consensus at the World Health Organisation on an investigation into the pandemic over language that refers to coronavirus’s origins.

Hua Chunying, from the Chinese foreign ministry, said that his government was open to co-operating with the WHO, but not on the basis of blame.


“China will make its due contribution with a responsible attitude on matters that will help the humankind to better cope with major contagious diseases,” Ms Hua said. “But China is opposed to any international investigation that assumes guilt, as pushed eagerly by some countries, including the United States.”

Chen Xu, the Chinese ambassador to the UN in Geneva, said that China would not invite international experts to investigate the source of the virus until the world wins a “final victory” over it. “It’s not that we are allergic to any kind of investigations, inquiries or evaluations,” he said.

“We need to have the right priority setting at this moment, and on the other hand we need the right atmosphere.”",,/r/europe/comments/gg20s3/eu_bows_to_beijing_censorship_over_source_of/fpwzyej/,EduTheRed,1588973065

2. They use Saudi Arabia as an example (a wrong one, btw, because first container was from Qatar).

The signing of the treaty of Maastricht in 1993 was passed by parliament, then challenged in court by a number of german citizens.  
In this challenge, the court reviewed the treaty and found that there are ambiguous things they need to interpret.  
They checked multiple interpretations and found that the one you are arguing violates the constitution, but the one I am currently presenting does not.

The Mediterranean diet is/was being pushed by the doctors because it's healthy, now some push it because it's environmentally friendly.

The Mediterranean diet refers to the eating habits of Greeks/Italians in the '60s.  It was first found by Ancel Keys in his ""Seven Countries Study"" where he found that Greeks and Italians were healthier than Northerners and Americans. Red meat in that period was eaten once a month by the average person and even the other sort of meats were eaten less than once a week. The Seven Countries Study also showed that the slowly changing habits of a population in the Mediterranean region, from a healthy, active lifestyle and diet, to a less active lifestyle and a diet influenced by the Western pattern diet, significantly correlated with increased risk of heart disease. The only true Mediterranean diet that has remained in Greece is practiced by the Mount Athos monks and unsurprisingly they arguably are the healthiest people on the planet.

Here I will answer with **Facts and Sources,** if you are genuine about what you say please read my entire response and respond accordingly, it's the only way this conversation has any meaning, if you listen what the other one says instead of closing your ears, which is something a nationalist would do. 

I cannot take it back, especialy when you have made comments like these ""  **murdered them, humiliated them, attempted to annex them and take their culture** "" (also remember that you justified Nazi collaboration and execution of innocents, based on these baseless lies) and still keep talking about heinous discrimination where if we both take a look at the article  [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cham\_Albanians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cham_Albanians)  the first mention of chams and Greeks together says this :

 **Muslim Cham and** [**Lab**](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labs_(people)) **armed units burned a number of Greek villages: 3 in the vicinity of Preveza (Tsouka, Glyky, Potamia), 4 in Thesprotia (Alpohori, Manoliasa, Keramitsa, Fortopia) as well as a number of villages in the regions of Ioannina, Sarande and Delvina.**  

and this:  **Especially in the Sanjak of Preveza, Muslim Albanians embraced ideas regarding the Albanian national movement of the time. Amongst them large landowners and state employees who came from other places were hostile to the local Greek population and persecuted them.** 

there is also this interesting bit about just after the balkan wars   *""Although the Albanian government complained that Chams were discriminated against by the Greek authorities, there is little evidence of direct state persecution at this time.*[*\[104\]*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cham_Albanians#cite_note-Victorp179-104) *""* Which shows even after all the chams have done, the Greeks were not inclined on pursuing vindication.

&amp;#x200B;

So that's how it starts, even if it ends here, which it doesn't we have more to go through, **based on your way of thinking** the Greeks branding them traitors and sending to albania the elderly that were left behind by their own sons (  *""According to British reports, the Cham bands managed to flee to Albania with their full equipment, together with half million stolen cattle as well as 3,000 horses, leaving only the elderly members of the community behind.*[*\[45\]*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cham_Albanian_collaboration_with_the_Axis#cite_note-Meyer_2008:_620-45) *"")(*[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cham\_Albanian\_collaboration\_with\_the\_Axis#Axis\_retreat\_and\_expulsion\_of\_Chams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cham_Albanian_collaboration_with_the_Axis#Axis_retreat_and_expulsion_of_Chams) ) Is by your very OWN words "" **understandable** "" (used on a hypothetical scenario where the Greeks are chams and vice versa), unfortunately for you and the Greeks **it doesn't end here**

**So, so far the Greeks have been discriminated, murdered and humiliated from chams** what happens during Greek rule after the defeat of the ottomans, how are the chams acting? lets see:

[*Reginald Leeper*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reginald_Leeper)*, the British ambassador at Athens in 1945, in a letter to the British Foreign Secretary at April 1945 mention that the Greeks can blame Cham Albanians for the murder of the Italian General* [*Enrico Tellini*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enrico_Tellini) *which was the pretext for the Italian* [*bombardment and occupation of Corfu*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corfu_incident) *at 1923.*[*\[136\]*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cham_Albanians#cite_note-136)*""* 

Here is another interesting passage about chams:

 "" *In May 1924 however, a delegation of the League of Nations visited the area to investigate the issue of exchangeability. The delegation met groups of Albanian Cham Muslims from various villages in the area that had been chosen by Greek authorities and local muftis.*[*\[114\]*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cham_Albanians#cite_note-114) *The local muftis were supportive of the Greek administration.*[*\[115\]*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cham_Albanians#cite_note-115) *Later, the delegation concluded that the vast majority of the Cham community declared that they were of Turkish origin and wished to be included in the exchange.*[*\[116\]*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cham_Albanians#cite_note-116) *One year later, a second commission in general confirmed the conclusions of the first one.*[*\[117\]*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cham_Albanians#cite_note-117) *""*

 It seems many of them left their so beloved land, because they love Turkey more

So far Chams have done heinous discriminations and terrible crimes against the Greeks, and all the while now leaving under Greek rule they still continue to be a problem for them, so they try to persuade them to leave, which those that didn't  dont want to do, of course, but in the meanwhile instead of joining the Greek nation like the Arvanites for example they are a constant thorn and trouble that still cause Greek deaths ""[*bombardment and occupation of Corfu*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corfu_incident) *at 1923"".*

A petition is made to the League of Nations, how does the league of Nations respond?

 *The League of Nations also stipulated that it would not deal with other raised Albanian concerns, as they had been subject to past reports and discussions. In sum, the League of Nations decision regarding the Greek position relating to the Muslim Chams was considered a clear vindication.*[*\[135\]*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cham_Albanians#cite_note-135)

Funny enough because Stalin also rounded up Jews and put them to work in the Gulag, a lot of the arguments for communism come from the belief that in acceptance of communism will somehow eradicate racism.

It’s the typical left wing fix all when they run out of arguments.

• “You’re a facist”

• “You’re a Xenophobe”

• “You’re racist”

It’s a tar brush tactic, despite the fact that I get my economics from a Jewish person who escaped the Nazis through Switzerland, and I also follow another Jewish economist who advocates for free movement of productive people,

Also a fact that people can’t wrap their head around Facism is essentially a form of Plato Socialism, the idea that people should be divided by class and graded based on their worth, the higher classes should rule but share their wealth and property with the lower classes and society should be ruled by a “Philosopher king” who drives the great lie that brings all of the classes together.

Aside from that Friedrich Hayek one of the most influential economists of all time said upon studying Nazism its identical with communism and just another spin off of collectivisation.

Also, A lot of the members of the Nazi party were ex-communist, Hitler delivered his famous Brownshirt appeal to a room of socialists and the Nazis literally copied Stalin’s national planning method.

Hitlers hate of communism was just a hate of the Slavic races and Marxian socialism, which is and never was “Just socialism”...socialism has been around since before Marx parents were born.

However, this proposal was rejected by the Greek side, who feared that Albania would forcibly evict its Greek minority from the country, making the exchange involuntary.*[*\[145\]*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cham_Albanians#cite_note-145)[*\[146\]*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cham_Albanians#cite_note-146) *""*

I would say this is **understandable,** after all those Greeks have lived there for **hundreds of years**, it would be a terrible crime to have them lose their property

Venizelos tries to **make things better for the chams**

 *""The Venizelos government (1928-1932), despite the former Greek-Albanian crisis, took measures to intensify the improvement of the Cham communities both on economic and social basis. In 1931 a law was passed that allowed direct payment of reimbursement through the granting of analogous bonds and the direct return of improperly expropriated urban properties. A number of Cham families responded to these favorable regulations. Moreover, the Albanian government accepted the Greek proposal for the payment of indemnifications in bonds, allowing that way the promulgation of the relevant legislation and thus enabling the process of paying indemnification to the Albanian citizens. Thus, in 1935, according to Greek diplomatic reports,* ***most of the Albanian demands that concerned the Cham communities appeared to be settled****.*[*\[147\]*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cham_Albanians#cite_note-147) *In April 1930, the League of Nations heard claims by small property Muslim Cham landowners that illegal expropriations occurred within the region, while Greek authorities stated that the region had been exempted from those land reform laws. In June 1930, the Greek government passed a special law that properties within Thesprotia were exempt from the Agrarian land laws which satisfied the League of Nations regarding the matter.*[*\[148\]*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cham_Albanians#cite_note-148) *During this time though, there were ongoing efforts by Greek authorities to prompt the dislocation of the Muslim Cham population by means of hard-line policies and migration to Turkey, while discouraging or even forbidding it to Albania.*[*\[149\]*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cham_Albanians#cite_note-149) *The Muslim Chams by the 1930s were viewed in Greece as a hostile population and* ***unable to be integrated within the socio-political structures of the state.***[*\[150\]*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cham_Albanians#cite_note-150) *""*

Let's take a breath here to say that we havent seen any mass murders and heinous crimes for years upon years on the poor cham population, which you also use, let me remind you, to **justify Nazi collaboration and mass murders and executions against innocent Greeks** who had never done anything to the chams**,** the thing that started our argument basicaly.

Now come 1936, Greece is faced with a **Dictator**, not an elected goverment, but a dictatorial regime with **no popular base**, oof 1936 to 1940 doesn't live a lot of years does it now? In those 4 years the nationalists dictatorship of metaxas, cracks down on **All Minorities in Greece** and doesn't single out the chams, he is a nationalist after all, he dissalows the use of minority languages outside of their homes, remember **Dictator Metaxas,** not poor farmer Nikos or Yannis who lives next door to a cham, still even from this nationalist dictator we **Don't** see heinous crimes like mass murders.

**now comes 1940 and we both now what happens then,** as the American Judges of the Nurember trials would say  *""plain murder"".*

 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cham\_Albanian\_collaboration\_with\_the\_Axis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cham_Albanian_collaboration_with_the_Axis) 

So now after all this discussion, answer me this, is this Justifiable still? And how could the Greek side keep this population, who let me remind you themselves fled  into neutral ground to avoid trial, because they know what they did and who still kept fighting with the nazis even when *"" the local British mission proposed an alliance to the Chams and to fight together the Germans, but this proposal was rejected.*[*\[37\]*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cham_Albanian_collaboration_with_the_Axis#cite_note-37) *"",* 

How would those people be left without trial for their crimes? How would it be allowed that the dead and their families would never find justice? they all fled anyway and the trials happened on their absent, since they didnt want to face justice for their crimes, but the dead, **the dead they caused would never come back to their sons, their daughers, their wives and husbands.** Think of them for a bit, show some **Empathy.**

They are considered allies because of the political ties which they have. A nation hostile to the USA, would likely choose to eliminate Israel separately if the opportunity presented itself, that would be a rational choice: Defeat in detail (also knows as divide and conquer).

&gt; Sweden’s unique strategy to deal with coronavirus will ensure it has only a small second wave of cases unlike other countries that could be forced to return to lockdown, according to the architect of the contentious policy.
&gt; 
&gt; Anders Tegnell, Sweden’s state epidemiologist who devised the no-lockdown approach, estimated that 40 per cent of people in the capital, Stockholm, would be immune to Covid-19 by the end of May, giving the country an advantage against a virus that “we’re going to have to live with for a very long time”.
&gt; 
&gt; “In the autumn there will be a second wave. Sweden will have a high level of immunity and the number of cases will probably be quite low,” Mr Tegnell told the Financial Times. “But Finland will have a very low level of immunity. Will Finland have to go into a complete lockdown again?”
&gt; 
&gt; Sweden and Mr Tegnell are under the global spotlight as their response to the pandemic has made them a global outlier.
&gt; 
&gt; Primary and secondary schools, restaurants, cafés and shops are mostly open as normal in Sweden, with health authorities relying on voluntary social distancing and people opting to work from home. Schools for over-16s and universities are closed and gatherings of more than 50 people are banned, but it is still the most relaxed approach of any EU country.
&gt; 
&gt; Sweden’s virus-related death toll on Thursday reached 3,040. This is significantly higher than Nordic neighbours Denmark, Norway and Finland, which have registered fewer than 1,000 between them.
&gt; 
&gt; Mr Tegnell said it would take about one to two years to know whose strategy had worked best and at what cost to society. He stressed that Sweden’s approach was to look at the “wide public health matter” in which an important consideration was that “people should be able to keep a reasonably normal life”.
&gt; 
&gt; The epidemiologist has become something of a cult figure in Sweden, with reports of people having tattoos done of him.
&gt; 
&gt; Public trust in Sweden’s public health agency has increased during the crisis, which Mr Tegnell in part attributed to his efforts to communicate openly, “answering the same questions hundreds of times”. He said he found the attention on himself “rather absurd”, such as his daughters “laughing hilariously” about a fashion magazine analysing his dress sense.
&gt; 
&gt; Mr Tegnell argued that “nothing [to do with lockdowns] had a scientific basis”, particularly decisions to close schools, because there was no evidence that children were a major cause of transmission.
&gt; 
&gt; He believes European leaders, fearful that their health systems would be overwhelmed, felt they needed to copy China’s approach, the first country to lock down because of the disease.
&gt; 
&gt; About a quarter of people in Stockholm had the virus at the start of May, according to a mathematical model by Sweden’s public health agency, which Mr Tegnell said was part of the reason the number of cases in the capital had fallen recently. By contrast, tests this week in Norway’s capital Oslo suggested that under 2 per cent of the population had been infected.
&gt; 
&gt; But Mr Tegnell said uncertainty about how long virus immunity would last meant it was unlikely Sweden would reach “herd immunity”, a level of the disease where so many people are infected — usually about 80 per cent — that it stops spreading. “I don’t think we or any country in the world will reach herd immunity in the sense that the disease goes away because I don’t think this is a disease that goes away,” he added.
&gt; 
&gt; Many countries’ hope is that they can keep the virus at bay until a vaccine is found. But Mr Tegnell said that, even in the best-case scenario, it was likely to take “years” to develop one, before it could be administered to an entire population.
&gt; 
&gt; “It’s a big mistake to sit down and say ‘we should just wait for a vaccine’. It will take much longer than we think. And in the end, we don’t know how good a vaccine it will be. It’s another reason to have a sustainable policy in place.”
&gt; 
&gt; Sweden’s approach has been to have a strategy that could last for months, if not years, without the need for big changes. That contrasts with nearly all other European countries, which are grappling with how to reopen their societies without sparking an increase in transmission.
&gt; 
&gt; This has led to some criticism from those who say Sweden should be trying much harder to curb the number of Covid-19 deaths. Per-capita death statistics show that Sweden is behind only the UK, Italy, Belgium and Spain at this stage of the pandemic.
&gt; 
&gt; One area where Sweden has done poorly is in trying to keep the virus out of care homes. Mr Tegnell, who suggests the higher infection rate in such homes in Sweden is the main reason why it has had more deaths than its neighbours, said: “It’s something that we deeply regret.”
&gt; 
&gt; He made the point that care homes in Sweden — like in the rest of the Nordic region — were for “the very old and the very sick”, as most elderly people live at home, and that there were known “quality problems” with care providers, often private companies.
&gt; 
&gt; “Unfortunately those quality problems have proven to make the elderly very vulnerable to infection,” Mr Tegnell said, adding that an investigation had begun.

I never claimed, that Hitler invented racism. He just build himself a rethoric and a racist word view, that was the underlaying ideology of WW2. 

&gt;	Would the US be a peace loving country without Trump?

Does Trump build factories to systematically kill his own population? Please stop trivialising the Holocaust ffs. The Holocaust was totally not ""a natural consequence of the economic situation after WW1"". That was a consequence of an almost comically evil regime. 

I agree to the point, that some other demagoge may have risen to power, some revolution happened or anything else, as the situation WAS unstable. But tf you denying the Holocaust here?

&gt;	And you would be voting for him!

Highly debatable. His world view together with the AfDs program goes against common sense as well as peer reviewed science. A lot of things would have to happen for me to support them.

&gt;	Versailles created Hitler and without him it would’ve created another German dictator. 

But i dont think you see, why i think you totally missed the point here. Again, now i type really slowly for you: the treaty of Versaille did not put the german citizens into concentration camps. The treaty of Versailles did not try to ethnically clense eastern europe. The treaty of Versailles did not singlehandedly escalate the situation to a second world war, when it totally didnt have to.

Wüsste nicht, dass das in den letzten 75 Jahren irgendwer gefeiert hat. Was du beschreibst (Vergewaltigungen, Morde, Raubüberfälle, und am Kriegsende Vertreibung) ist ein Nebeneffekt von Krieg, der in jedem Krieg seit Anbeginn des Universums auftritt. So zu tun, als wäre das etwas, was nur den Deutschen widerfahren ist, sprengt die Grenzen der Idiotie und Ignoranz. Frag mal die Flüchtlinge, die aus Syrien zu uns kommen, die gleichen Geschichten wie 1945.

Wenn du die ethnischen Säuberungen in den an die Sowjets gefallenen Gebieten meinst, dies ist in der, sich mit der Sowjetunion beschäftigenden, Geschichte behandelt. Ansonsten gab es keine weiteren Vorfälle in der Nachkriegszeit, die der Beschreibung ""ethnische Säuberung"" gerecht werden. Obligatorischer Verweis auf die DDR-Geschichte/politische Verfolgung an dieser Stelle.

Flucht und Vertreibung ist durchaus ein Thema in der deutschen Schulbildung (zumindest war es das als ich '16 fertig wurde). Und ich bin selbst ein Mensch mit schlesischen Vorfahren, also kenne ich die Geschichte selbst.

De Gaulle had shown some initiative with his armored columns and achieved much success with new tactics, but bickering between French and British commanders caused them to do sporadic attacks rather than coordinated ones and for the Allied troops to get encircled. 

The whole surrender of France can be blamed on poor leadership by the British and French. They had the soldiers, the equipment and the technology.

I know being ungrateful is normal for you, but really now, few minorities in Europe have what Hungarians have here and you still cry all over the place for not having enough. I am sorry for you. 

What “penalties”? Lol. You are free to fly whatever flag you want, penalties are paid only by public institutions that use a different flag, other than the Romanian one. In your house you can fly the Chinese flag if you wish, t is not illegal. It is not illegal for Szekely to use funeral flags for our national holiday, so I think you should get informed better. I doubt it’s the Hungarian counties that receive THE LEAST, but yes, I’m not surprised if they are at the bottom of this. What innovation can you talk about when mayors in those areas and officials from the area do not speak the Romanian language? Look up counties with significant Hungarian minorities that are doing much, much better: Bihor, Arad, Cluj etc. Why? Because people there are willing to at least learn the language of the country they live in.

&gt;So yeah, this is totally skewed in our favor because DAMN Modern Greece has some solid Civic foundations.

Uh, what;?

&gt; • Everything Ancient Greece

Ok

&gt; • The Enlightenment

Is Greece somewhere in France, Germany or Britain? I can't name any Greek Enlightenment philosopher fron the top of my head



&gt; • Abolitionist Society

Never heard of this. Was Greece even independent by the time this was an issue?

&gt; • One of the first modern Constitutional Democracies

Greece was ruled by all kinds of dictatorship untill the 1970's

&gt; • Being at the right side of history in World Wars / Cold War

Ok. Bilions of people can claim that, though

&gt; • Abolition of Monarchy and went thought a lot of hardship in the 20th century.

Like most countries?

&gt; • And finally, In my experience - and I am fairly well traveled - the most solid balance between individualism and collectivism there is. A very libertarian society on the small and non-important things, and a very involved society on the big and important things.

Others are posted because some people's identity revolves around ""REVOKE TRIANON REE"" and while personally I think that yes, whole outcome of the world wars were kind of bullshit on our end (a lot of extortion and manipulation, yet we were punished as if we ourselves pushed Moustache man willy-nilly and not Germany) compared to the punishments; it is water under the bridge and if such people put half as much energy towards trying to make their lives better and the country better, maybe we would be somewhere.

I guess Russians can choose, European or Asian. Russians are from Russia, that I guess everyone agrees on, and Russia is located in BOTH Asia and Europe. If not then parts of Norway suddenly became Asian since Norway and Russia share a border you can cross, and it's NOT at the in the easternmost part of Norway, also:

""European Russia is the western part of the Russian Federation, which is located in Eastern Europe. It covers up to 39% of Europe's total land area ""

""European Russia covers less than 25% of Russia's territory, it has a population of 110 million people, housing 78% of Russia's population, making Russia the most populous European nation. All three federal cities of Russia lie within European Russia, namely Moscow, the capital of the Russian Federation and the most populous city entirely within Europe; Saint Petersburg, the cultural capital and the second-most populous city in the country; and Sevastopol, located within the disputed territory of Crimea and considered by most countries in the world to be part of Ukraine.""

But politically they are closer to countries like China and North Korea. Never been anti-Russian before, maybe because I've been to Russia a few times, it's not as bad there as people say.

5273,"Well now you're just pointing out other problems with capitalism ;). Specifically fractional reserve banking and central bank inflation that comes with interest payments.

Also, that's a terrible example. Most major stocks in (for example) the s&amp;p500 are vast multinationals with assets across the world.

Secondly, markets price in future value, not current value. (at this point I feel adding a disclaimer that I'm a full time trader is required).

Finally,you would assume a socialist leaning government would have relatively high taxation and control of the currency. They could inflate the cash into existence if they wanted to.

Its also worth considering the companies and governments do this often at smaller scales. Entire towns have been purchased to make way for everything from quarries to dams. In Australia the government purchased the guns back off their citizens after changing gun control laws.

EU wants trade disputes resolved. What alternative body would you suggest handles a EU-UK trade dispute? Countries have them all the time and are subject to courts. Which one would you suggest handles them. Hot tip, it won't be the UK courts.

&gt;And i've read the previsions of CETA its pretty good to be honest not quite as good as EU membership but given it doesn't come with any of the negative aspects of membership it seems like a decent trade off. 

CETA took 8 years to ratify and is still being implemented. The UK wanted theirs in under a year (lol).It works because Canada is miles away and UK is close. Therefore the EU agreed as it would not bring major competition where as giving the UK the same would do so.

The other issue is that in trade negotiations you try to converge on rules to iron out red tape. The UK is trying to diverge from a system that has very little red tape. Very difficult to do and close a trade deal.

Cut that out and you can eat more filling food to stop you feeling hungry for longer and hopefully cut down on snacking later.

- reduced incentive for gaining useful skills and experience

5438,"&gt; Oh is there someone over the police to stop police from abusing their authority? 

Yes, it's the people. If the people don't want you in charge because you, as you describe yourself, are a terrible person, then you're not gonna be in charge. 

&gt; I want things he has that I already have 

Why? You won't be able to sell them because there will ideally be no money. There's no incentive to take away something you already own from others other than to actively hurt them, which is pretty sociopathic behaviour. Sociopathy certainly won't be weeded out in an anarchist utopia of course, but actual genuine people without empathy, particularly in a society that would incentivize empathy, would not be common. 

&gt; Oh there's someone to stop me from doing that? 

Yep, again, the people. You'd need to win over the people to get to that point and the second they don't want you there anymore, you're out. Hell, depending on the commune maybe it'd be entirely impossible to get to that point in the first place. 

&gt; Your ideal society, which would allow terrible people to run rampant would be super fun to loot, but also put me in danger from other looters. I'll loot it if it comes to it, but would prefer to avoid having a society that is constantly vulnerable to looting, since then I'll get looted too. 

And yet somehow the anarchist attempts didn't fall apart due to terrible people in their communities, but due to outside influence. Weird how that is, considering that the system is supposedly so vulnerable to terrible people.

You're making lots of assumptions about how an anarchist society would work without knowing any actual theoretical basis of it while just overlaying your experiences and framework of our current society onto an entirely different system as if humans are somehow static and don't develop differently based on their environment. Not being educated at all on the matter doesn't mean that you can't voice your criticisms of course, but when arguing so flippantly and dismissively, then the least amount of common courtesy is knowing at least a bit about the subject at hand. 

If there's one thing I'd like you to take away from all this, it's that anarchism isn't just free love hippies doing drugs or whatever it is you imagine, it's a political philosophy with a strong academic background with many wildly different schools of thought behind it, and that deserves a bit more respect than whatever stereotype you imagine.",Russian in Germany,/r/europe/comments/geer4s/the_estonian_institute_of_historical_memory/fptlxah/,CaptainAnaAmari,1588893725

It's not, but Belarus is a lot more integrated with Russia than even Ukraine was. The loyalty of their armed forces is even more questionable.

At the same time I think it's important to look at the state of affairs as it is. If there are specific signs a given country is backsliding, we should take note (be it Western, Eastern, Northern or Southern European). But extrapolating problems to a whole region where they largely don't (yet) exist is baseless.

And a note on Poland. We in Lithuania get slightly more exposure to what is happening there. It's not good, very worrying actually, in that the independence of courts has been reduced. Nonetheless, Poland is not yet beyond the point of no return. And there are signs the ruling party PiS doesn't want to go too hard too quickly. They back down on key issues when they face pressure from the opposition and the EU. The recently postponed COVID presidential election is a good example.

Then you might still feel hungry, because you’re literally absorbing some of the fat into your gut since the sugar has turned off your ability to burn it and feel it as a food source. 

The good thing is, there’s a way to lose fat pretty quickly, called fasting! 

Why do we store fat? So in dire times we can make like a bear and eat our own body!

&gt;support and rule from the dictator in Damascus

Didn't they basically only agreed to work together with Assad only when the USA ditched them?

&gt;People in the U.S. can fulfill their needs by eating out of a dumpster

Needs aren't only food, needs are also things such as housing and healthcare, which is something that you have to agree isn't properly provided to those who do not have the means in the USA.

&gt;In your system I'd steal because that way I could get things I wanted (not needed!) for free without needing to work for them

That's not how it works my dude, you're truly misunderstanding anarchism. Everybody will be expected to work. Now, if you do want something that your neighbour has but you don't have, *then you would get it.* Anarchist economy would be planned decentrally, if a community expresses desire for a certain product, then that product will get produced. Now, if theft (or any kind of other crime) still gets committed, then of course there would still be consequences, but what those consequences would be would depend on the commune: it could be some community service, rehabilitation centers or whatever else.

&gt;Also if you really believe that people would only steal to fulfill needs than I assume you think rich and powerful people today (who have their needs fulfilled 1000 times over) are never corrupt and never steal from anyone.

Oh, the rich and powerful are absolutely leeches. However, the problem here is capitalism, which incentivizes getting ahead of others and thus greed.

&gt;People should abandon these moronically stupid ideologies so that they fan focus on fixing the real world with real world plausible ideas.

The people who entirely abandon reality for the sake of some ideal are *entirely* stupid, I 100% agree with that, but there's no reason why somebody couldn't, say, advocate for significantly better climate policy, while also trying to increase class consciousness or have book clubs discussing anarchist theory or something like that.

Socialism and communism will always be destined to fail. Your ideas are noble but you will fail. Not because your criticisms with capitalism aren’t valid, but because it goes against the natural way humans do business. A pure free market is the natural state without any restrictions all things being equal. Market forces will always push towards equilibrium no matter what your government or so called “collective state” says or tries to do. 

That’s why you will fail, and always will, and it’s back by science. You assume all workers desire the same thing, but they do not. You will never unite and the situation that will be born out of your supposed “revolution” will always be worse. Because communism is the definition of failure.

5777,"The fun part about experts in european law is the disconnect happening in between acknowledging that the legal position is valid and that they do not like it **politically**, like here between these two answers:  

&gt; SZ:So there is this old motive that runs Karlsruhe?  
The ""ultra-vires"" concept was already developed in 1993 in the Maastricht ruling. Then nothing happened for a long time, and it was reanimated in the 2009 Lisbon ruling. And now it has been applied. There could be something else behind it: The European legal community is similar to the German one. **We too are used to legally channeling political conflicts** [...] That has a pacifying effect.  


&gt; SZ:More such judgements will come from Karlsruhe, and the other criticisms will not fade away. Aren't we at some point at which politics should reorganize the situation? Where Europe would have to be refounded?  
There is some evidence that **Karlsruhe's case law has become a massive brake on the meaningful further development of European integration**. In many places we in the EU are so caught up in German regulations that we do not even want to move forward. Majority decisions in the euro area are partially barricaded because Karlsruhe links this to the eternal core of Article 79, 3 of the German Constitution via the principle of democracy. There is no way of getting around this, only with a new constitution.

5781,"The Court of Justice has perverted the treaties to explain them as allowing the ECB to bail out individual eurozone member states.

Article 125 TFEU states that the EU shall not bail out member states and that they remain responsible for their own debt.

Article 21.1 of the protocol on the ECB states that the ECB shall not provide credit to individual member states, or buy government bonds directly.

What the Court of Justice ruled in the Gauweiler and Pringle cases, is pervert the meaning of these words and allow the Union to undertake all  measures necessary in order to save the Member States financially.

These powers were never attributed by the Member States to the EU.

German constitutional law prohibits the spending of taxpayer money without the approval of the bundestag.

The German constitutional court could simply rule that Germany must leave the Eurozone or whatever is necessary to stop the illegal spending of taxpayer money.

The German constitutional court instead opts to enter into dialogue with the Court of Justice and the ECB to find a solution for acting outside their mandate.

Blaming leftists/liberals/whoever is a conveninent escapism excusing yourself for not thinking clearly about what's going on, and an excuse to a false belief that a one, single solution may address whatever multilayer process is in place. Like, go conservative, respect ancestry and stuff, and all will straighten out. The job loss, technology vs society, information flow, democracy, climate, energy, all will be solved.

5996,"Also, Greeks seem to harshly discriminate against Albanians still. There is allegedly a common stereotype by Greeks to think of Albanians as criminals and degenerates. Albanians are the most likely ethnic group to be murdered by Greek law enforcement. The EUMC states that Albanians are singled out as targets of racism and called turks even. In 2010, at a military parade, Greek soldiers (!!!) chanted in unison ""they are skopians, they are Albanians, we will make clothes out of their skin""!!!   


You Greeks should have strives to be like your ancient ancestors, founders of European philosophy and great thinkers and warlords. But now, the main population of Greece, the greko-turks, are like sub-humans in their treatment of others, crash into bankruptcy and cannot admit their crimes against humanity and massacres while claiming to be victims when they cannot properly in fight a war. Absolutely pathetic what the Turkish mixture with your genes has done. Your nationalism is unwarranted.",,/r/europe/comments/geiouj/on_this_day_615_years_ago_this_legend_was_born/fprmjr4/,cell689,1588857678
