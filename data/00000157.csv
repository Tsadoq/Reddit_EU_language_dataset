Some context...

Initially, the [Spanish Electoral Commission tried to ban Puigdemont and Comín from running for the European Parliament](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/biamn4/spanish_election_megathread/em1x754/). Which was an illegal move by Spain, because Puigdemont can't be banned from becoming MEP since he fulfills all the requirements to run for the European elections as established in the Spanish law.

After his candidacy was finally accepted, his party won the European elections in Catalonia, being the most voted party in all four Catalan provinces. 

In June 14, [Spain's Official State Gazette](https://www.boe.es/diario_boe/txt.php?id=BOE-A-2019-8953) officially proclaimed him and the other 2 as elected MEPs.

Now, Spain can't simply stop them from becoming MEPs. After being allowed to run for the elections and being elected by the citizens, they have to become MEPs. There's no way that 3 seats can remain empty in the European Parliament indefinitely.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/c8fr92/meps_call_for_catalan_separatist_meps_to_have/esn7osz/,GulaDelNorte,1562124697

114,"&gt; Though in most cases English will be sufficient anyways.

If you want even lower voter turnouts in small countries that don't speak English, then yes, it would. Effectively, you would remove large portions of the populations from politics. They won't know what's going on in politics or what the candidates that are supposed to represent them even stand for.

This idea that everyone should speak English or some other big language is just ridiculous. That is seriously a Soviet Union 2.0 type idea.

&gt;Which amounts to not transnational parties but merely the same system as we have today where EP candidates enjoy the same freedom of movement as all EU citizens including picking a country to increase their chances of being elected. That is reality of the present. 

Yes, and if a candidate wants to get elected in Estonia they have to talk about issues that Estonians care about in languages that Estonians can understand, meaning that they'll be talking in Estonian. This means that people who will represent Estonians actually stand for the issues Estonian voters care about.

The idea you're talking about where you can get votes from anywhere means that you just ignore small countries like Estonia. You're a candidate there but it makes more sense for you to campaign in some area in Germany than the country of Estonia, because you can get more votes there. Thus a representative of Estonia would be standing for issues that people from other countries care about and nobody would end up representing what Estonians care about.",Estonia,/r/europe/comments/c85fum/macrons_group_in_eu_parliament_demands/esmxpjb/,Aerroon,1562117547

But after reading the article, I have to say it's not wrong either. And all of you with your witty tongue in cheek remarks who scoff at these kinds of articles: I hope you realize that you provide political clout and legitimize governments like in Hungary and Poland.

And let me get this straight. If you don't see how the Orban-esque school of thought is a serious threat to democracy you must have either been in a coma for the last couple years or you are deluding yourself.

311,"I pointed out in another comment that the term 'European' is far too vague a descriptor. It's uncertain whether it's defined culturally, politically, geographically, historically, or a combination of the four. Without first establishing what we mean when we use the term 'Europe' or 'European', it's impossible to state that a country is or is not a European country. 

For example, if we were to define the term geographically, there's a glaring flaw that immediately comes to mind. Firstly, both Russia and Turkey are similar in that they have a minority of their landmass in Europe and a majority in Asia. The distribution of their populations doesn't affect this fact, so with this in mind we either have to say both or neither of them are European. 

The geographic definition brings forth a more serious issue however: the arbitrariness of the designation of the Asia-Europe divide. This 'border', which now rests at the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, has changed multiple times since classical antiquity. If we were to go by your logic (their origin in Asia) and follow the historical Asia-Europe divide, the Don River (which was changed with the Russian expansion eastward), then defining Hungarians as a European people would be debatable as they are believed to have originated between the Volga River and Ural Mountains. There isn't, nor has there ever been, a clearly defined divide between the two that isn't just an arbitrary designation. The fact is that Europe and Asia are one and the same, an entity called 'Eurasia'.

We could try and put in further arguments as to there being a cultural/historical definition that supports the geographic definition and strengthens that argument. But I think that this will still not be enough. The history of Turkey and Europe is very much entwined, and having a good understanding of Turkish history is fundamentally important to having a good understanding of the history of Europe. And I think historical and cultural similarities are as important to define 'European' as it's place on the Earth.

But I don't want to seem like I'm being needlessly argumentative. We define 'Europe' and 'European' differently, and all I wanted to do was highlight some (I have by no means exhausted the difficulties in undertaking this task) of the difficulties with this important issue.

1. Women tend to put less focus on their career and many times end their careers, to become a mother.
2. Historically, there was some discrimination against women in these positions, so even if we had a 50% quota for new admissions, it would need a long time, before there's a 50% quota across tue board

Regarding Franco A. himself, the court decision wasn't made because he was considered an innocent person.

But you can only go so far with that. Perhaps Orbán is so dominant in Hungary that he can afford it, Polish, Czech or Slovak governments not so much because in each country, there are relevant opposition parties which are even more anti-Brussels and which can play their rhetorics way more effectively.

Going too anti-Brussels would then risk decreasing their diplomatic value in the EU and boosting their own anti-Brussels opposition at home while losing some of their own not some much anti-Brussels voters. It's a careful game they have to play, especially in Poland and Slovakia where most of the voters are quite strongly pro-EU, they just aren't pro-refugee quotas.

Then why are they not showing up to votes that would directly affect the systemic changes they claim to want so badly?

To rehash your example, a party campaigns for less funding for parties in general, it itself accepts the same amount of money as all other parties (as is right, according to you...) but then a vote is called on whether to up or lower the amount of funding party gets and guess what? The party that campaigned for the lowering doesn't turn up to vote on this key issue. As a result party funding goes up and our example party gets to go right back to campaigning on lowering party funding without ever lifting a finger to change it.

Any deal means that UK has to co-operate with EU on this. This is all about billionaires and old money trying to hide their wealth. Only a no-deal does it and that is what they want. They don't care at all about economy, they just do not care about anything but how to keep their wealth hidden. At any cost. No-deal brexit is absolutely the worst of the options and that is their goal. They keep asking for extensions and don't come up with ANY solutions to the problem. This is just delay tactics for the inevitable: Britain will leave EU with no-deal.

882,"&gt;You could stay in your first class cabin on the Titanic, or you could get in the lifeboat, accepting a short period of discomfort, but way better future prospects.

That analogy doesn't work because Scotland faces much worse long term prospects after independence. Recent research puts the benefits of EU membership at about 1 - 2% of GDP, but the benefit of UK membership to Scotland is 8.4% of GDP:

[https://voxeu.org/article/gains-economic-integration-eu](https://voxeu.org/article/gains-economic-integration-eu)

&amp;#x200B;

Couple that with the 6% of GDP that Scotland receives as a fiscal transfer from the UK and independence stands to cost Scotland more than 14% of GDP (without counting the knock-on effects).

It was one of three major peace agreements in the period after the 1815 Congress of Vienna. It was the final act of the Congress of Berlin (13 June – 13 July 1878) and included Great Britain and Ireland, Austria-Hungary, France, Germany, Italy, Russia and the Ottoman Empire. Germany's Otto von Bismarck was the chairman and dominant personality.


&gt;The most important task of the Congress was to decide the fate of Bulgaria, but Bulgaria itself was excluded from participation in the talks, at Russian insistence. At the time, as it was not a sovereign state, Bulgaria was not a subject of international law, and the same went for the Bulgarians themselves. The exclusion was already an established fact in the great powers' Constantinople Conference, which had been held one year before without any Bulgarian participation.


&gt;The most notable result of the conference was the official (de jure) recognition of actual (de facto) newly independent states of Romania, Serbia and Montenegro.",,/r/europe/comments/c867xy/eastern_europe_as_regulated_by_the_treaty_of/esk5ksd/,DazzaVonHabsburg,1562052111

by Mark Twain

For example, in Year 1 that useless letter ""c"" would be dropped to be replased either by ""k"" or ""s"", and likewise ""x"" would no longer be part of the alphabet. The only kase in which ""c"" would be retained would be the ""ch"" formation, which will be dealt with later. Year 2 might reform ""w"" spelling, so that ""which"" and ""one"" would take the same konsonant, wile Year 3 might well abolish ""y"" replasing it with ""i"" and Iear 4 might fiks the ""g/j"" anomali wonse and for all.

Jenerally, then, the improvement would kontinue iear bai iear with Iear 5 doing awai with useless double konsonants, and Iears 6-12 or so modifaiing vowlz and the rimeining voist and unvoist konsonants.

A Plan for the Improvement of English Spelling

by Mark Twain

For example, in Year 1 that useless letter ""c"" would be dropped to be replased either by ""k"" or ""s"", and likewise ""x"" would no longer be part of the alphabet. The only kase in which ""c"" would be retained would be the ""ch"" formation, which will be dealt with later. Year 2 might reform ""w"" spelling, so that ""which"" and ""one"" would take the same konsonant, wile Year 3 might well abolish ""y"" replasing it with ""i"" and Iear 4 might fiks the ""g/j"" anomali wonse and for all.

Jenerally, then, the improvement would kontinue iear bai iear with Iear 5 doing awai with useless double konsonants, and Iears 6-12 or so modifaiing vowlz and the rimeining voist and unvoist konsonants. Bai Iear 15 or sou, it wud fainali bi posibl tu meik ius ov thi ridandant letez ""c"", ""y"" and ""x"" -- bai now jast a memori in the maindz ov ould doderez -- tu riplais ""ch"", ""sh"", and ""th"" rispektivli.

There was orthodox metropolitan and there was unbroken metropolitan succession, after Michael Rahoza signed union with Catholic church. Union didn't liquidate orthodox church in PLC, just the church accepted communion with Catholic church. Basically reversing 1054 schism.

The problem was that two bishops in last moment abstained, and there were two orthodox hierarchies in PLC - one in union and one against the union. They later as you said elected separate metropolitan.

It's funny that you are accusing Poland of this act of ""persecuting orthodoxy"", while first of all the union was valid in the whole PLC, in fact it was enforced even more fiercely in GDL.

Secondly the same thing happened one century earlier in GDL. Grand Dukes were enforcing union of Florence (1439) in GDL (actually Kiev metropolitan Isidor was one of the most prominent supporters of the union, later he was even acting as Latin patriarch of Constantinople). For more than 40 years GDL was enforcing union of Florence on its orthodox subjects, going as far as outlawing and banishing metropolitans designed by eastern Patriarch of Constantinople (it was the fate of for example metropolitan Spirydion).",Poland,/r/europe/comments/c7psqg/on_this_day_450_years_ago_union_of_lublin_was/esjz0t8/,iwanttosaysmth,1562046009

|India|328|
|Brazil|300|
|US|295|
|Japan|263|
|China|209|

China is apparently low for administrative reasons:

&gt;China defines “cities” differently than most of the western world. In China, the primary subdivision is the province, and some cities are direct-controlled municipalities such as Chongqing which, being on the same level as provinces, take up about the same amount of space!
&gt;
&gt;The Municipality of Chongqing which in countries like Brazil or the US would be multiple cities and some large suburbs in a metro area and then some, are considered a single city. Most cities in China have massive limits from the size of an American county all the way up to a province, including both urban and rural areas.
&gt;
&gt;This is one of the reasons why (other than its large population) that there are a whopping 160 “cities” in China with over a million inhabitants but only 9 in the US. This is also evident if you look at the map. If you zoom in on China, there are far-spaced large bubbles but over Brazil and America, there are large bubbles surrounded by a host of small bubbles.

Not quite the case, in theory the UN treaties would cover this, but there would need to be a vote to take any action and that was a vote that like with goa would have been lost.

The modern china we think of today is very much a result of the handover (HK was 25% of it's gpd at point of hand over, now I think it's about 2%.

1486,"&gt; OP was wrong in their word choice with a link that wasn’t in English.

As Op explained here, he used an archaic terms, even in English; about the link, I only meant to give all here, the Latin root (rapĕre), I'm not expecting that people gonna readi it in Italian (even if google  translate and others exit... but, anyway...)

&gt; Can’t be proof of anything if I, and most of this sub, can’t read it.

...

&gt; And no, in today’s English, “rape” is correct. While the old Italian might directly translate to “abduct”, that is “abduct” in old English. You need to translate old Italian -&gt; old English -&gt; modern English. Best translate is rape, like it or not.

So, in modern English if I say that /u/Devildude4427  ""raped me in an alley"", for the 90% who read this sentence, means that you ""kidnapped"" me in an alley? Are you sure?

But wait, same goes for Italian; ""/u/PHEELZ  ha subito un ratto da parte di /u/Devildude4427 in un vicolo"" ... are you sure 90% get the meaning...

Moreover, we are talking state vs. state and I think you would punish the people unduly with this shifting of borders.

Nobody asked your opinion on Rammstein, they merely explained a joke to you that you didn't understand and asked people to explain it to you, which they did. 

Then going ""Ew, your joke and your taste in music is shit."" is unnecessarily rude and inapropriate.

Can i have a source on the bavarian greens blocking the construction of new wind turbines?

I know it happens sometimes that there is opposition to a new wind turbine, but that is usually based on the location and environmental impact, for example, my town planned the construction of a few new wind turbines, which would have causes great damages to a very old forest which is still mostly untouched by forestry and harbours great natural beauty.

Nothing to show for immigration policy... Do you expect them to build a wall and shoot everyone who approaches within a 2km radius? They are a usual centre left wing party and their stance on immigration aligns with that. What is there to change when the current immigration policy already aligns mostly with what they want? Whats left is the treatment of the incoming people.

Skyrocketing rents? Yeah not really. The rents have been on the rise in most major cities over a similar amount. See Düsseldorf, Köln, Frankfurt, etc. I don't doubt that the renovation initiative didn't make the situation better rent wise, but it is definitely not as extreme as you paint it.
The G8/G9 debate oh yes. Introduced early this decade by the CDU and definitely very controversial. I for one am one of the early G8 students in my state and i personally was very okay with it.

The Korean war is just some thing that happened which is why NK doesn't like us now, making it seem more like a policing action. Nukes are bad, here's a funny duck and cover clip. Berlin wall, Warsaw pact, just bubble choice answers for tests, we're never informed who was in the Soviet bloc, but we are told about the occupation of Germany by the different powers. China goes communist, then they help north Vietnam? Cuban missile crisis actually got good coverage in my high school, like we spent a whole week on it. 

After that just the different 60's movements. We also spent a good chunk on Vietnam, and while Korea has been forgotten, we discussed the Vietnam war from its French occupation beginning to the evacuation of the US followed by the defeat of South Vietnam. Rest is a bit of a blur, collapse the USSR, and 9-11. Not much if anything on the Yugoslav breakup, different Warsaw pact nation revolutions, or a single word about South America or the breakup of the British and French Empires outside of India.

1836,"&gt; I'm not expert so take that with grain of salt. Warfare was strongly  influenced, sabre, armor, horses was direct response to Asiatic threats.  Food and clothing, also. Typical polish dishes, Russian perogi, Breton  beans, Hungarian goulash, sauerkraut (German), tomato soap (Italian),  pork chop (Austrian?). These are not Asian but you get a drift. 

I get what you mean. The military point is a good one IMO. When it comes to other cultural aspects.. I don't know, I'm trying to think of something that could be considered a heavy eastern influence but I fail to see any. I still think Polish culture was predominately ""western"". I mean, there was for instance Scandinavian influence in England, particulary the language, loanwords etc. but generally the Scandinavian immigrants adopted English culture and I doubt anyone would call the English a western-scandinavian culture. It was a similar case with Poland. Then again I'm not an expert on history, just interested in some of it, so perhaps someone could correct me. 

&gt;Part is noblility virtues (respect toward weaker, women, chivalry). And displaying them was a way to feel connection with nobility

Makes sense, but weren't those virtues commonly shared across Christian Europe? It's just that in other countries they got the chance to evolve their customs. In case of Poles, in order to maintain what they considered their cultrue during partitions, they had to hang on to past times. That's just my take, though, but I think those differences that we have today come from 123 years of non-existence and then another 40 of pretty much theoretical existance. (as a free nation, country).

&gt; Poles are product of their history and environment. People who try to  understand or even advise Poles without knowing their history are either  mildly handicaped or have aganda to push. 

I agree, we are indeed a specific nation, which is why I dislike when some folks here either generalize about Poles and Polish culture or lessen the impact \~40 years communism made. And to be clear, I dislike A LOT about our current culture. But I think in order to change it and move on from it, we need to understand it and know where it comes from.

1853,"The idea that Iran is unhinged and aggressive is what's being hammered into Trump's low information voter base.

The only reason Iran has been acting out and causing headlines lately is because the Trump administration cancelled the Iran deal for absolutely no practical reason. The deal was the result of careful multilateral diplomacy, heavily in the West's favor, forced Iran to accept heavy monitoring and inspections of their nuclear capabilities, and in turn eased the sanctions on the Iranian economy so the regime could focus on keeping the population happy rather than angry and belligerent.

In other words, if the goal was to keep Iran (and by extension, the region) peaceful and stable while limiting their capability to develop nuclear weapons the Iran Deal should have been upheld. So what exactly is the Trump administration's goals with regards to Iran?

1998,"&gt; The current government dislikes renewables and can't shut up about how awesome coal is. 

That's why they are investing into renewables like never before and has all those emission reducing strategies? I mean come on, I understand that you may not like our current government, but how about at least a little bit of objectivity? Try to read up on all the investments into renewables in Poland and in V4 and you'll see the governments are putting a lot of effort into it. However, a headline saying ""things are progressing"" does not grab quite as much attention as ""Poland destroys the climate by not agreeing to wave a Magic Wand That Solves Everything"".

&gt; And then buys it from Russia, while screaming at Germany for having a gas pipeline.

It's easy to yell at the gov for buying Russian coal if you know jack shit about chemistry. The problem is, only certain type of coal is energy efficient enough to burn in power plants. Russia (and eastern Ukraine) has it. Poland does not. If we tried to burn Polish coal in our power plants, at the very best we'd dump A LOT more pollutants into the atmosphere to keep up with the demant. We could theoretically buy high quality coal from our western partners, but they need it themselves for their own coal powered plants, so we'd have to pay premium price for it.

We buy coal from Russia not because we like Russia so much. We buy coal from them because there is no other option.",South Macedonia,/r/europe/comments/c7q5cd/german_environment_chief_seeks_dialogue_with/eshb4d0/,miauracjusz,1561988258

2000,"&gt; He commends D’Albis’s team for using a mathematical model that substantially reduces the chance that the economic changes result from factors other than migration. “The method greatly limits confounding factors by eliminating those with long-term effects,” he says.

In Anna Karenina, Tolstoy tells a beautiful lengthy semi-autobiographic storyline on the struggles of his alter ego Levin, who tries unsuccessfully to implement reforms to make his estate more egalitarian.

My point being: it's quite probable that Nikolai II was a ""good guy"" even if he was at the head of a very conservative authoritarian government.

2211,"&gt; Unless you're proposing to have the courts (the ECJ) make the decision? I really don't think you want to go there. 

Why not? It already largely works this way. Okay, the Court cannot decide to strip the voting rights of any country, but it can issue the fines. In fact, only the Court can issue the fines, not the Commission. And so far, the Court has been more effective in halting the reforms of the Polish government than anything the Commission or the member states did.

The problem is that when you are insisting that this is a political issue and that it needs to be handled by the Commission and the member states, you then have political fights between the country in question and the Commission and other countries. And effectively, you are tearing apart the relations.

You are bringing up all the bitter issues between the member states, you are sowing distrust, as you could see from Hungary, the ruling party issues it to rally support among the population against the EU and the officials in question (in this case, largely Timmermans), this spills over in other countries in the region that are allied to the affected countries, i.e. you can see that Czechia and Slovakia are too against Timmermans even though Article 7 was never trigerred against us.

The resulting situation is what you can see today - if Timmermans is elected, it will further deepen the rift between V4 and the Western Europe, he has the reputation here that all he can do is to preach here about how we should run our countries, how diverse we should be etc., he is someone who is perceived to not understand the region not just the forces who are allied by people supporting Fidezs or PiS, but by people supporting the opposition too. And now you get him as the Commission president, even though a specific set of countries find him unacceptable.

Of course this would have never been such a huge problem, he would have never been so unacceptable, if this issue wasn't politicized in the first place and if it wasn't handled by career politicians but instead professionals in the justice sector.",Czech Republic,/r/europe/comments/c6yex9/merkel_backs_real_lead_candidates_tipping/esgtfyw/,kristynaZ,1561966020

2259,"&gt;Don't forget how the Brits invented concentration camps to get rid of the boers

You know that that's not actually true though, right? The British used concentration camps most certainly, to *concentrate* the boer civilians (hence the name). They were neither designed nor intended to kill the populace, but rather to establish populations of boers who would not / could not take part in the guerilla warfare against the British Army.

The British military and governance tried relatively hard to implement good sanitation, nutrition, clean water, and medical care in the camps. The main causes of mortality were epidemics such as typhoid, measles, etc. which killed around 8,000 British soldiers and guards, along with infected water (typhoid), and also the lack of food which was primarily caused by regular attacks on the supply trains which headed north to the camps, on the single train line which ran to them.

Of course, in modern terms we would say that the British army had a duty of care to the people in the camps, and although they recognised this and paid highly for doctors and nurses to come from the UK, and spent significant money on building water pipelines, shipping meat, etc. to the camps, they obviously still failed given the mortality rates.

To say that it was ""to get rid of the boers"" is hopelessly ignorant though.

2275,"&gt; Every sovereign nation that was victim or in any way affected and injured by German aggresion can demand compensation of reparation. Even nations that were not sovereign in 1945 (like Lithuania, Belarus or Kosovo).

The way I understand it is this: Everyone can demand reparations, but when push comes to shove only the winners can actually enforce them if you leave morals out. 

But I actually genuinely don't know what these cases look like in international law. Would there have been a (legal) way of e.g. Israel to *insist* on reparations for confiscated properties or was that something the German state ended up doing ""voluntarily"" (because everything else would have been political suicide)?

There's another elephant in the room, that (at least far as I know) generally flies under the radar, Italy:
&gt;According to the Treaty of Peace with Italy, 1947, Italy agreed to pay reparations of about US$125 million to Yugoslavia, US$105 million to Greece, US$100 million to the Soviet Union, US$25 million to Ethiopia, and US$5 million to Albania.

Could France demand reparations from Italy? Sure. Would they have an actual legal basis for it? Would it be reasonable to do so officially?

&gt;No. Because 1953 declaration was unilateral, it wasn't treaty. 1950 was treaty with East Germany, it wasn't biding for West Germany, that's why WG signed separate treaty with Poland later. Also Poland was acting 1953 obviously against its best intrests under political and economical pressure from Soviet Union*, that's why declaration can be regarded as invalid ab initio.

As we've had it in the other thread: The Soviet Union was in charge of paying (German) reparations to Poland. The USSR plundered the GDR and was legally allowed to do so:

&gt;Direct and indirect reparations paid by East Germany between 1946 and 1953 amounted to $14 billion in 1938 prices.

It stands to reason it's rational for the US hem to demand of Poland that Poland renounces reparation demands from Germany - since the SU signed a treaty where **they** were officially the nation in charge of recompensing Poland.

If the SU would have been an actually decent state Poland would have received a decent share from all the money, the Soviet Union would have kept the rest, the GDR wouldn't have been turned into a shithole and we (hopefully) wouldn't even have this discussion right now.

So:

1) Germany loses territory to Poland. Totally not reparation but just a compensation for things the Soviets stole from Poland. Alright. Fair enough.

2) The GDR gets plundered by the Soviet Union as a form of reparation. The Soviet Union was in charge of reparations to Poland. Now Poland comes to Germany and wants reparations from Germany **after** the Soviets already took their share.

Why is Poland coming to Germany and ~~wasn't demanding it from the Soviets~~ (sorry, had to) isn't going to Russia?

Is it because Germany has a better economy? Is it because it's politically beneficial to demand it from an ally but not from an enemy?

___

&gt;You can see perversity and dishonesty of German governement here - they never agreed to pay compensation for Polish vicitims, instead they insisted to call it ""humanitarian aid"". Polish side needed to agree, because it was already end of 20th century, and these people were dying, it was last chance for them to receive any kind of justice.

That's a **very** fucking good point and you probably know as well as I did why it's most likely called that way: If it was called ""reparations"" or something similar it would open up Germany to more demands.

That's the very same reason the 2+4 treaty was *functionally* a peace-treaty but Kohl advised his people to both avoid the word ""peace treaty"" and to avoid e.g. the Greek to get a seat at the table. [SPIEGEL reported about this in a 2015 article](https://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/vorab/kohl-trickste-1990-um-reparationen-an-griechenland-zu-vermeiden-a-1019586.html), after gaining insight into archives. The general idea however was known, at least partially, in Germany at the time:

&gt;„Für Bonn gilt es, eine Form zu finden, die einen Friedensvertrag – der nach dem Londoner Schuldenabkommen gewaltige Schadenersatzzahlungen an zahlreiche Staaten der Welt zur Folge hätte – überflüssig macht“

&gt;""Bonn needs to find a form that makes a peace treaty - which, according to the London Debt Agreement, would result in enormous compensation payments to numerous states of the world - superfluous.

-FAZ, February 12th, 1990.

Now, that's where it becomes complicated. Even **if** I would argue that not towards Poland (because Soviets, but that's a different topic) - but most definitely regarding individual victims and especially other countries such as Greece.

Morally and ethically sneaking out of things like that is wrong and that's exactly what Germany did in 1990.

On the other hand, is the opposite morally and ethically just? 

Polish officials recently mentioned 850B$ as reparations. Greece claimed 279B Euros in 2015. Combined that'd be roughly 1000 times as much as the total German debt right now.

If we take all money the German state spent in 2019 combined (0.356B) and spend it on this it would take **over 3000 years to pay this off**. And that's demands from just two countries whereas more than half of Europe could make demands.

I, a random German citizen whose grandparents were too young to even participate in WW2, would be forced to pay money for my entire lifetime if Kohl and the allies made a different choice in 1990. I probably wouldn't be alive if the allies made a different choice in 1945. Meanwhile German schools teach us that [Sippenhaft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sippenhaft) was a disgusting concept which the Nazis abused and something that should never again occur on German soil.

**Even if** a different choice was made in 1990 the only realistic option to enforce payment of those demands would have been to take armies, march into Germany, take everything that exists of value and effectively enslave the German population.

I'll go out on a limb and say: This is why the allies didn't demand reparations in 1945 and this is why the allies supported Germany with the ""sneaky"" option in 1990 and which is why other governments didn't bring it up either. Anything else would have been complete insanity.

Now, the ideal scenario would have been to simply argue that in 1990, make other nations understand and come away 100% cleanly. But I *do* have full understanding for doing it the way it was done because the risk to both the German population (probably the primary reason) but also Europe as a whole was just too much.

___

And, while I still most definitely am curious about your reply regarding the Soviets, because, well, fuck the Soviets, that's where I think I don't have much more to argue.

If the Polish state or you as a Polish citizens want to argue that the Germans alive today deserve to pay for crimes they had nothing to do with, after genuinely trying to all in all be good neighbors for multiple decades then that is your right.

The Germany existing today is not the Nazi Germany that started ravaging Europe in 1939 and which started ravaging Germany almost a decade earlier. I, as a random citizen of the successor state to Nazi Germany, believe I have *responsibility* of helping to keep the memories alive, much more so than maybe other European citizens who keep those events in memory.

But I also refuse to feel *guilty* for those events and I especially reject the notion that I deserve to be *punished* for them - which is exactly what asking for reparations in 2019 does.

PS:

&gt;So advocate for this ffs! As you can see Polish vicitms were completely screwed. Jewish victims were/are receiving monthly pensions from Germany, that are probably higher than this 2 363 one-time ""aid"" Polish vicitms received.

You 100% convinced me on this part. But I also learned why I should phrase that as asking for further compensations, not reparations. =P

2310,"[**__Aragon__**](https://youtu.be/hu1DJdbGZk8)

The Crown of Aragon emerged as a major power from humble origins as a mere County in the Pyrenees. After winning its independence from the now much reduced Kingdom of Navarra, Aragon entered into a union with the County of Barcelona. Its monarchs were eager participants in the Reconquista, the campaign of conquest against the Muslim states of Iberia, which saw Aragon expand to its current southerly extent and add the Kingdom of the [Legendary El Cid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Cid), Valencia, to the composite Crown.

The Kingdom of Naples has finally been integrated after its conquest in 1442. The former King of Naples, René of Anjou, had fled to Provence where he continued to insist upon his claim not only on Naples but also on Aragon itself as well as Jerusalem. We pursued him even there, and with the Duchy of Provence destroyed, the Pope confirmed our claims to all those titles.

Aragon’s relationship with its powerful neighbour Castile is difficult to pin down. Though these nations share a dynasty, the feuding House of Trastámara is rarely at peace with itself. At times it seemed as though peace may be possible and that the two Crowns could be united into one, while at other times it seems that the kingdoms are destined to struggle against one another for eternity as bitter rivals. Both were true, as Castile and Aragon fought against the neighbouring Kingdom of France together, only for Aragon to later exploit the weak claim of the [Castilian heir](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/543615049940336650/592520279197220875/Iberian_kerfuffle.png) (while not having an heir itself) and force it into a Personal Union in a bloody war where the Aragonese troops [persevered](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/543591586265563174/592852692234141706/20190623175015_1.jpg)

Beyond dynastic matters, Aragon is a nation deeply concerned with dominating trade in the Mediterranean. Aragon’s Consulate of the Sea aims to regulate and administrate all trade in the region, while Catalan and Valencian merchants encouraged our Monarch to conquer Genoa to control the flow of profit. Aragon also has designs upon the elusive silk trade. Silk has traditionally seen almost no production in Europe; its secrets are closely guarded but now with the [Llotja de la Seda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llotja_de_la_Seda) finished in Valencia, we are the main producer of Silk in Europe. But not only that, shortly beforehand manufacturers in Barcelona figured out a new way of Gemcutting called Faceting, which allows the Catalan artisans to cut the rare stones in entirely new shapes and to much greater brilliance. 

All was set for our great trade empire to prosper, but Northern African pirates kept disrupting our trade and it just so happened that they, too, were those unbelievers we just recently had expelled from Iberia, so martial action was taken and the Land split between the Kingdom of Portugal and ours.

As the rest was Europe devolved into ever bloodier conflicts and big Kingdoms falling left and right and new ones taking its place, after the last Emperor in Austria was forcefully removed from office, the Electors looked to the most stalwart defender of Christianity to defend the Holy Roman Empire, and so the King of Aragon was crowned by his holiness the Pope *Imperator Romanorum*.

While the Muslim threat from the south was subdued, the threat from the east has increased evermore, with the Ottoman Turks having defeated both the Timurids and the Mamluks. Not enough, new heresies have spread in Christian Europe and already the Kingdoms of England and Poland have fallen to its lies.

In stark contrast to the examples I mentioned, defining trait being that they were *controlled by foreign powers*, Germany did this all to themselves and on their own.

Yes, I do hear those things all the time. And 80% they are purposely being subtle about their admiration towards fascism or being apologetic towards it for some bizzare reason.

If the first thing that some random internet stranger brings up about a horrible vicious being is about the small insignificant ""good attributes"" that they contributed, then that should raise flags  and tell you that there is something not right about that stranger.

I kinda doubt that.

&gt; The experience of Eskarkhanov suggests that they were right. By the time he agreed to tell his story in July, the cycle of attacks had not only chased him out of Russia, it also followed him to Germany, suggesting that the violence has reached deep into the European countries now offering protection to the victims. As Western governments and human rights groups have tried to resettle these men, they have run into a problem few of them expected: Chechen immigrants inside Europe were often ready to continue the purge that authorities in Chechnya had started.

&gt; “It’s been a big concern of ours,” says Kimahli Powell, the executive director of Rainbow Railroad, a Canadian advocacy group that helps resettle gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people who face persecution around the world. “There is a close knit Chechen diaspora in Europe, and so there are also places in Europe where individuals could be at risk.”

Nevertheless the case still stands that the chart in question is and always has been inflation-adjusted, and not unadjusted as you claimed.

That data from 2012 was not available in 2010 does not seem particularly surprising, nor does it seem to be something you can fault the authors for.

&gt; Additionally it was missing 8 reactors and sorted reactors by construction completion instead of construction start. So outliers in construction time (and thus with higher cost) showed later in graph.

But the Fig. 5 chart doesn't seem to indicate that higher construction time would *worsen* the escalation picture in different sorting. With two exceptions, the units with longer construction times don't seem visibly more expensive. I'd expect that shifting them to later years would rather flatten the average trend or at least keep it roughly the same. (I'd rather want to draw both charts to compare them, though.)

But...the paper you linked just said that it wasn't?

2531,"it's a generalized point, I pulled 15k out of my ass as an example, don't fixate on that number specifically. I'm not assuming that everyone in the UK can save 15k, of course they can't. Obviously someone on minimum wage in the UK won't be saving 15k. It's just to compare 15k with 1.5k. Compare 5k with 500 if you prefer, or whatever.

The very general point is just that if you are in a richer country with a higher wage, the discretionary money you have left over at the end is going to be worth more, even if it is the same percentage.

There are obviously amounts where someone will be worse off at a higher salary in an expensive country than a lower one in a cheaper one, I'm not claiming that for absolutely any combination of values someone with a higher salary in a developed country is always better off. Just pointing out this reason as one factor.

Life on minimum wage is not going to leave much room for savings anywhere, this point isn't specifically to those on minimum wage. If you can barely cover essentials, then you aren't going to be saving much and will just be getting by wherever.

I wouldn't presume it's a luxurious life in Slovakia on 2.76 either. That percentage may be the average for the country on rent, but this probably isn't the average for minimum wage workers, from a quick Google people are saying rents are high and have gone higher. I imagine you have a lot of people living together in very cramped circumstances if they are on that money, multiple people sharing rooms.

&gt;As a consequence of aggression by Nazi Germany, much of Poland was subjected to enormous destruction of its industry (62% of which was destroyed), its infrastructure (84%) and loss of civilian life (17.07% of its citizens during the war). Material recompensation incurred by Germany has been estimated as approximately €1.5 billion to 2006 exchange values, which equals to about 2% of all material losses of Poland, not including enormous loss of human population of about 6 million people.[6][7] For those reasons, Poland still remains the country with the least amount of received reparations compared to the amount of damage done from Germany.

And second one, nobody denies Germany admits killing Jews in the Holocaust of their design. They fail to acknowledge destruction and death they caused in Poland and to Poles as is summarized in citation above but also to other countries in Eastern Europe.

&gt;The term Kniefall von Warschau, also referred to as Warschauer Kniefall, (both German for ""Warsaw genuflection"") refers to a gesture of humility and penance by West German Chancellor Willy Brandt towards the victims of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising.


In this publicity stunt he scored points with Jews as he knelt before their victims. Cheap move but effective, media probably loved and it didn’t cost him one pfennig.

2810,"Honestly, I dont think most of the pushback is against gay people just trying to live their lives, nor is it directed towards transgender people just trying to live their lives.  A lot of the pushback is against activists that try to police other's language and try to redefine basic concepts for all of society.  For example, most people wouldn't call a girl wearing construction clothes a man, but we are told that how one presents themselves suddenly defines whether someone is a man or a woman.  Most people think phrases like ""a man gave birth"" or ""a woman's penis"" are ridiculous, but certain activists would have you believe you are a bigot if you push back against anti-scientific viewpoints.  

In Russia, it might be different, but in the West I see this a lot.  People will say ""We are just trying to be left alone!""  Particularly in the transgender movement, this is not why people have such a hard time with it.  Science has shown that transitioning is the most effective treatment for transgender individuals in some cases, but it has said nothing about the etiology of the disorder.  It has not, contrary to some activists, proven that transgender people have the wrong brain for the sex they were born as.  The movement is overreaching and damning those that dare to look at it in a rational way instead of a way filled with emotional appeals.

Its easier for countries that have.

Location of Poland also is a big problem. not that much sun for solar and wind not that strong, we are building wind power plants but it takes time, Poland is also planing to build nuclear power plant but once again it will take time.

still problem of funding energy projects exists, all the current energy projects are already eating away all the wage increases, if they try to push harder it will only create more problems for the country, people leaving(brain drain) and so on, Poland has many other problems that it has to fix at the same time as decreasing CO2 emission, like how underfunded health care here is, its a damn miracle how well our healthcare system works with how underfunded it is(in whole EU its bottom third, just above Romania and Bulgaria).

2881,"""Science"" has not proven that gender is a spectrum, certain social scientists have equated one's behaviors and expressions as the totality of gender and *then* said it exists on a spectrum.  This is problematic for many reasons, for example, this viewpoint would label a woman with short hair and in construction clothes as a ""man"" because of her expression.  It reduces one's gender to stereotypes, and it equates one's interests and behavior with gender, which is extremely sterwotypical.

Gender and sex have been synonymous for a long time.  Only in the past couple of decades have social scientists tried to make a clear division between the two.  This leads to all kinds or absurdities, such as phrases like ""a woman's penis"" or ""a man gave birth"".  It just does not make sense at all.  What makes a lot more sense is that gender and sex have meant the same thing, but there is a subset of the population that has a disorder in which they crave to be identified as the opposite sex.  It does not matter why they do, because we don't understand the etiology, but they do.  For them, being recognized as the opposite sex is helpful.  So let's call them transgender individuals and refer to them by the pronouns they want in person out of politeness.  But we should not eschew the majority of scientific research and logic just to satisfy a tiny minority.  If they can't handle being referred to as transgender men and transgender women, and insist they are just called men and women in all cases, that is on them.  Missing from this discussion is any responsibility in the transgender side.  All you hear is about how they keep demanding how everything be redefined to suit *their*interests, no matter the logical inconsistencies that result from it.

Remain may very well win in a second referendum, lovely. But the underlying clash between Britain’s desire to avoid ever closer union and the EUs desire to carry on with it does not get solved.

If we decided to cancel brexit and stay in, all it would be doing is kicking the can down the road a bit, we WOULD leave eventually anyways, but we would be leaving when our economies and systems are even more intertwined with Europes, meaning it will become increasingly damaging to do so.

I’m sorry my friend but unless you have a magical way to make the British public suddenly reverse their fundamental disagreement with ever closer union, then Britain leaving the EU is a foregone conclusion, whether it’s now or in a few years.

&gt;The EU CATEGORICALLY stated that the ""transition"" method that Alex Salmond promised would allow Scotland to join the EU the second they leave the UK if Scotland had voted leave was false

Where?

&gt;Regardless of a queue

There is no queue.

&gt;THEN applies as a new member state and goes through the joining process as all states are doing that have split apart from a parent country

Which countries have split from existing EU members?

This is an entirely unprecedented situation - it is not the same as a new member joining because in 2014 Scotland already existed within the EU. There is no legal guidance covering this scenario.

&gt;The EU have confirmed as recently as April this year there will be no special preferential treatment for Scotland.

Because the UK has now voted to leave, and is months away from doing so. This is not the same as the argument being made in 2014.

&gt;The EU confirmed that new countries joining the EU have to join the ERM with the goal, after 2 years, to be using the Euro as soon as they fulfil the conditions, there is no set timeline but ultimately you have to.

True - this amounts to nothing more than a commitment, and could in practice run for decades.

This is OK though, as adopting the Euro eventually is not something the SNP are against.

&gt;A Scottish currency would be acceptable as short interim though it would tank on day one

Is that right, aye? You'll be in the minority there with that opinion...

&gt;As it is, Scotland's budget would not allow entry due to not meeting requirements

Scottish budget is decided by Westminster spending. An independent Scotland does not have a deficit as the budget does not exist. 

[Deloitte said of GERS figures in 2017 referring to the impact on Scotland of a recent global slump in oil prices , ""Commentators suggested that, under these conditions, Scotland would struggle to operate as an independent country. However, GERS data is produced for Scotland as part of the UK - it does not model scenarios for an independent Scotland in which the Scottish government would be enabled to make its own fiscal choices"".](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_Expenditure_and_Revenue_Scotland#Criticisms_of_GERS)

2970,"No, in those last 10 centuries Romanian evolved differently from Albanian. Most of the similarities between Albanian and Romanian originate from before the 6th century AD. These evolutions are traceable, we have a solid idea when a word entered the language, and when it didn’t.

For example, the words modhull ~ mazare in Albanian and Romanian respectively. See the difference? Romanian undergoes rhotacism of l &gt; r all the time before Slavic migration, not so much after, compare how the term kopil was borrowed as copil in Romanian, with l unchanged.

See how consistent is this in Albanian and Romanian, both in common words and Latin root words:

njegull ~ negura
mugull ~ mugur
pëllumb ~ porumbel
popull ~ popor
pyll (&lt;*pëdyll) ~ padure
etc.

Now see the Slavic loanwords in Romanian:

kandilo ~ candelă
hvala ~ fală
žalĩ ~ jale
navaljati ~ năvăli
oklou ~ ocol
etc.

The l doesn’t change to r. That happens in words that Romanian shares with Albanian and Latin root words, but not Slavic loanwords, showing it’s a pre-Slavic evolution.

2999,"&gt;Millet-i Sadıka 

So they were loyal and you guys started removing them and attempting to destroy their culture by further minoritizing what was already a minority in their homeland?

&gt;armenian revolts.

Why'd they revolt if they were so happy? Could it be that being a millet meant being second-class citizens and not this term of endearment you see it as?

&gt;slaughtered thousands of turkish civillians 

Interesting this is the only place you choose to use language this strong. What about all the Armenians slaughtered throughout Ottoman history? What about the genocide of moving a million Armenians from their ancestral homeland in an attempt to destroy their identity?

&gt;Because od these rebellions ottoman empire lost city of Van

And who caused this? Perhaps it was distrust of heavy-handed Ottoman officials who had done so much harm to the Armenian people.

&gt;I don’t say armenian genocide didn’t happen

You just want to equivocate to remove blame from the Turks for a genocide caused directly from their actions.

&gt;But their aim was not kill armenians just deportation meanwhile they died because of deseases and gangs

What do you think the goal was? Because I think it's fair to say that the goal was to disarm the Armenian population, spread them across Syria to prevent them organizing, and then Ottomanize their culture even further. Would you say that's accurate? The end result of course was far worse and the Turks did little to help as tribes harassed and killed them on their journey. A journey where prior to they had their houses and properties seized by thr state and were only allowed to keep what they could carry on their backs.

&gt;We should’ve take care of them but we couldn’t

Just lies. Of course you could've; the cruelty and hardship WAS the point. Your people have blood on their hands like everyone else. No need to pretend otherwise, you're not special or evil to be descended from these folks and you shouldn't feel responsible for the action s of others. But don't you dare go around denying genocicde and expect to be respected by the rest of the world.",,/r/europe/comments/c6ywe0/freezing_austrohungarian_soldiers_somewhere_in/eses7ex/,MrFallman117,1561908140

3007,"The whole article is pretty biased, and the cited MEPs carefully chosen to fit the narrative.

It's EPP vs ALDE, not France vs Germany. Just happens that one guy is German and the other French. That Green MEPs allowed themselves to get dragged into the dispute and are now finding themselves split and on opposite sides should also be no surprise, because that's what usually happens when it comes to a choice between principles vs pragmatism.

Should they abandon the rules, drop the Spitzenkandidaten-system and give in to the call of power, like Jadot seems to have done?

Jadot's behaviour in this regard is as shabby as Caspary's.  
Trying to silence the opposition by invoking the killer argument of ""German Nationalism"" just because it increases his chances to get his favoured coalition going should be below his standards as a French Green MEP.

His other arguments are laughable. Which candidate the EPP nominates is none of his business, and now pretending that he would have favoured other German candidates, who apparently didn't even run in the election, only thinly veils his motivations. Attacking the Spitzenkandidaten-system itself now is also pointless. It was agreed upon and the election was held under this premise.

Ottoman empire was not a “thing” lt was a powerful empire which controlled north africa middle east black sea balkans and anatolia. You should look and see. For example Ottoman empire ruled bulgaria for 500 years you know assimilation is very easy thing you know better than me. We could’ve assimilate bulgars greeks serbs albanians arabs extc. But we didn’t. And you can be surw about that we were not expecting the betrayal of Armenians. 300.000 ottoman turks/kurds are slaughtered by armenians and russians in 1893 Otto-russian war. And in ww1 Russia created armenian milita divisions with the mass armenian gangs who passed to russian armenia. While these were happening ottoman army was about to collapse because soldiers were running to theie villages to protect their families from armenian gangs. 120.000 turks are slaughterwd in eastren anatolia and after they captured Van with armenian rebels. The deported armenians after 1920 started to help french army in southern turkey and they continued to terorize. I think you don’t know exact term of genocide. Genocide is the thing what happened to Jews chinese and Native Americans(you killed them). What happened in eastren anatolia was two sided massacres between Kurds Turks and Armenians. And you don’t know the 1918-1920area. Thousands of Turks are slaughtered by armenians till turkish army pushed armenian army and militas to russian armenia.

3095,"Holy shit, is anyone on this site able to have a discussion without being a complete twat about it?

&gt;1. It is expensive to build, but as you wrote it cost so little to operate for decades while producing so much more energy than anything else. You put examples of currently building plants trying to state billions like it is suppose to make us shocked. OMG I THOUGHT IT COST $3.50 TO FIX THE ENVIRONMENT!

No I never said it would be cheap to save the environment, stop fabricating a strawman to argue against. We need to save the environment and we can do it with cheaper and faster options than nuclear. My comparisons are using the levelised cost of electricity which accounts for the full life cycle of a reactor. Even with the reduced operating costs nuclear is still more expensive than most renewable options by a wide margin that is growing every year as nuclear gets more expensive and renewables get cheaper. [See the dozens of studies contained here] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_electricity_by_source) 

&gt; But would you care to put in there expected annual output with average capacity factor for nuclear plants? Then compare it in cost and annual output against existing wind or solar cost? 

I have no interest in generating an energy audit of currently operating nuclear power plants. I have better things to do. If you think it's relevant you do it. 

&gt; No need to bother, [someone did it](https://imgur.com/a/t14zYm5). Sure they gave fuck about inflation. But one would think from your rant how extremely more expensive it is per MW produced, when they are not.

Again see the wiki link above with dozens of studies. I refuse to take seriously an imgur album with a handful of pictures as serious evidence to be weighed against numerous studies from various organisations finding contrary conclusions. 

&gt;
&gt;   JESUS FUCK YOU CALLED THEM economically unfeasible while france with its ~60 reactors operating by the government has one of the [cheapest prices](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Electricity_price_statistics) for electricity in EU! Is that magic? Or are they feasible?

France built their reactors predominantly in the 80s and haven't had a new reactor come online since 2002. The economic situation has changed dramatically since then. Commercial scale PV didn't exist then. Wind energy was just emerging in a significant way. France has a large and well established nuclear industry, they are the exception not the rule. Because of the size and maturity of their industry they could feasibly build cost competitive new reactors now but we haven't seen them do that so that's speculative. It is the construction of new reactors I am saying is unviable not the continued operation of existing ones. That was evident from my original comment, you deliberately chose to argue in bad faith by reframing it into something else. 

&gt;  How is it that people always spout this shit about nuclear being expensive like its 10 times more, while we see germany energiewende in action and spending of 200€+ billions and getting [so little for it.](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/sites/default/files/styles/gallery_image/public/paragraphs/images/ghg-emissions2018-standapril2019-uba-gross4aprilneu.jpg)

Because of the facts outlined in the numerous studies I linked above. 

&gt;2. renewable with current level storage can not do what nuclears can do. When sun dont shine and wind dont blows, factories and cities can not stop. Storage at the level needed is heavily terrain dependant like pumped storage hydro, or solutions not even tried on bigger scale. Is it expensive? We dont know, people are trying all kind of things from literally storing kinetick energy in huge multi tone massive rings, or thermal with chemical salt reaction, or just dumb ass lithium batteries. The point is we are not there to really rely on it.

Peak demand is during the day which is when renewables also peak in output. Depending on where you live and lots of other variables at night energy is often sold below cost because of baseload oversupply. In Australia there's been a few instances recently of energy being sold for &lt;$0 because the oversupply was so high at that time. There are numerous storage methods and alternative baseload sources other than nuclear that aren't fossil fuels. There's geothermal, pumped hydro, flywheels, compressed air and so on. Pumped hydro and geothermal are the most developed and more than capable of serving the needs of most regions for daily cycles. I agree many of the alternatives are mostly in the prototype stage and large scale lithium battery storage is certainly an awful idea. I can't speak specifically to the feasibility in Europe but in Australia our national science body commissioned a study that demonstrated a 100% renewable grid plan with no nuclear was possible and we have fuck all water for pumped hydro not to mention being the flattest and lowest continent with barely any geothermal. Even with the larger population the higher tectonic activity and higher rainfall and terrain variation in europe should make such plans even more feasible.",Australia,/r/europe/comments/c75zfv/map_of_temperatures_in_spain/esejecv/,spectrehawntineurope,1561900921

It seems that the one in the wrong is you, because the amount of lignite usage, which is the worse for the envinroment than hard coal or natural gas, appears to have remained pretty much constant for the last few decades. If the nuchear power was kept at mid 2000s levels instead, with all the growth in renewables setor the production of energy from lignite could have been greately diminished.

Please let me know if you have suggestions to make this roundup better for /r/europe. I can search for posts based off keywords in the title, URL and flair. And I can also search for comments.

If you would like this roundup sent to your inbox every day send me a message with the subject ['europe'](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=subredditsummarybot&amp;subject=europe&amp;message=x). Or if you only want a weekly roundup, use the subject ['europe weekly'](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=subredditsummarybot&amp;subject=europe%20weekly&amp;message=x)

However, I can do more.. you can have me search  for any keywords you want on any subreddit you want.

FWIW, this can actually be much worse.

Also, FWIW (and I know you didn't mention it) paper bags are about the worst thing you can do from a carbon standpoint. Reusable plastic is best, then single use plastic, and paper and reusable cloth are both pretty bad. Mostly because of the energy required to move all the water to make them.

If that assumption is more or less correct we should compare period 1955-1982 for Germany with 1990-2017 for Poland (at least I remember that from my source). Performance of Germany after 1982 is irrelevant for this analisis. Then all fall in place, Germany had its miracle in this period, there was oil crisis, too but Poland experienced 2008. All in all Poland outperformed (slightly) Germany in coresponding periods which was what I expected. What I cannot understand is why Poland didn't outperform Germany in period 1990-2019 head to head.

3630,"If you ever wanted an example of how weak, short sighted and powerless EU is all you have to do is look at Albania. 

Another round of negotiations and Albania is deemed not to have met the “EU’s economic and judicial standards”. While these do matter, in the long run they are completely insignificant. Countries like Albania (and similarly other small European countries) can not function in today’s world without becoming someone’s satellite. I think this can probably be said for most countries in the world today. You give up certain freedoms and in exchange you get a superpower to support some insignificant agenda you have.

The real superpowers that have been playing geo-politics for decades, realize this and do not give a shit about your economic and judicial status. This means that in the current climate Albania will turn to whoever provides the support EU will not. This leaves someone like US, Arab countries, and China. All of which realize that making Albania a satellite and extending their foothold in Europe has significant benefits. While EU is still questioning the Judicial standards, that will mean fuck all 50 years from now, these “superpowers” are purchasing their politicians in Albania (and elsewhere, this is not isolated to us) and manipulating elections to get them elected. In turn creating their own puppet government. 

Albanians have every desire to become part of EU but ultimately will support those that support them in turn.  EU is focusing on issues that have a shelf life of few decades. The EU politicians focus too much in their individual nations agenda to see the benefits of working as a block. Obviously Albania’s condition is no-ones fault but it’s peoples but these political games being played are much bigger than what these news make them to be.

My brexit vote has nothing to do with any of that. It was a result of the inflexibility of the British public’s desire with the path the EU is heading down.

The EU is heading towards a super state of ever closer union.

The UK public will never, ever, want this. 

Both of these truth cannot coexist, one HAS to give way to the other. To me, either choice giving way to the other is an evil choice.

To force the British public into an ever closer union would be absolutely horrendous.

Likewise, to force the EU to continue avoiding the reforms it wants to enact simply because we do not want to, would be selfish to a ridiculous degree and breed an ever increasing hatred towards us from the europhiles.


The only fucking option is that we break apart as amicably as possible and try to forge a new relationship on the other side. One that will obviously be bloody worse for all of us,  but at least we avoid one of them two terrible choices.

So please tell me oh wise remainer how YOU would solve them? Because your sides case was to just stick your head in the sand and keep on hoping the political stalemate of Britain in the EU would carry on forever. A status quo of Britain being a roadblock to integration.

3698,"It's *probably* similar for most nations and areas.

The explanation I've seen is that in general women (especially young women) tend to be more economically mobile than men. They tend to be the ones that ""marry out"", they tend to be the ones who move towards jobs and who tend to move for education.

Men tend to stay closer to their homes, tend to be seen as those who inherit houses or farms.

In a nutshell, the % of women living in an area seems to be a really good indicator for economic prosperity.

Just to be 100% clear the map linked is from 2007 (I just haven't found a better one with newer data), the correct title would be this:

* Sexual proportion of people born between [1983 and 1987](http://www.daburna.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/deutschlandkarte_sexualproportion_20bis24jaehrige.jpg) (red=more women), proportionally (20-24 years old in 2007).
*  Sexual proportion of people born between [1973 and 1977](http://www.daburna.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/deutschlandkarte_sexualproportion_30bis34jaehrige.jpg) (30-34 years old in 2007).

In context this makes it even more obvious: Women in their early 20s are *extremely* mobile. Women in their early 30s start to settle and leave the cities a bit - but they'll still stay in the general areas they picked earlier.

The most extreme example on these maps, as you can read in theri sidebar, is 149 women:100 men in the map for women between 20 and 24.

This also should ""the migrants are stealing our women"" into context.

3741,"&gt;Not to their victims they not. Not to the countries they destroyed.

It's not that simple. First of all the occupation forces were responsible for reparations and  the allies agreed that **no money would be payed as reparation**. It was also agreed that all payments went directly to the **four victor powers** - who were in charge of redistributing them.

&gt;According to the Yalta Conference, no reparations to Allied countries would be paid in money. Instead, much of this value consisted of German industrial assets, as well as forced labour to the Allies. Reparations were to be directly paid to the four victor powers (France, Britain, USA and the Soviet Union), for the countries in the Soviet sphere of influence, the Soviet Union would determine its distribution. 

1) Territories were annexed.

For example the German territory that went to Poland counts as a reparation.

2) Industry was dismantled:
&gt;Foreign stocks of about 2.5 billion dollars were confiscated. The remaining German industries had to give up a share of their production to the Allies. Large shipments of steel, coal, but also other industrial production were seized and transported out of the country. Later the Western Allies softened their stance in favour of the Marshall Plan, while Eastern Germany continued to deliver industrial goods and raw materials to the Soviet Union until 1953.

3) Intellectual property:
&gt;The Allies confiscated large amounts of German patents, copyrights and trademarks worth about 10 billion dollars.

4) [Forced Labour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_labor_of_Germans_after_World_War_II)

5) Germany payed the occupation costs of the allied military.

6) Reimbursement for Holocaust victims:
&gt;Until 2005 about 63 billion euros have been paid to individuals. Additional payments by German companies which exploited forced workers have been made.

3833,"&gt; How do you think QEII would fare against 12 P-700 heavy AShM?

Asking the wrong questions. Any anti-ship missile would be up against the destroyers.  

&gt;The Type 45 destroyer is equipped with the Sea Viper (PAAMS) air-defence system utilizing the SAMPSON active electronically scanned array multi-function radar and the S1850M long-range radar. PAAMS is able to track over 2,000 targets and simultaneously control and coordinate multiple missiles in the air at once, allowing a large number of tracks to be intercepted and destroyed at any given time. This makes it particularly difficult to swamp PAAMS during a saturation attack, even if the attacking elements are supersonic.[57] The US Naval War College has suggested that the SAMPSON radar is capable of tracking 1,000 objects the size of a cricket ball travelling at three times the speed of sound (Mach 3), emphasising the system's capabilities against high performance stealth targets.[56]

Arguing that not every single soldier was morally responsible for this is a more nuanced opinion.

People have lumped this together, I actually believe that there are very few people who actually believe the Wehrmacht as a whole was clean. Ignoring the countless war crimes committed by independent units which in bad faith you could argue to be ""outliers"", they literally were instrumental for the holocaust. 

So often a guy comes around and says ""I don't believe a conscripted 17 year old who worked on a farm before that is morally responsible for crimes of the Wehrmacht/third Reich"" and people act like he said he believes the Wehrmacht was an honorable army that only defended the Vaterland.

3952,"&gt;You're looking at everything with the great power of hindsight.

You are correct and I said so. 

&gt;The futility was obviously not obvious to the people, otherwise they wouldn't have fought back so strong.

An interesting point. Maybe their leaders who were sipping tea in exile should have told them over the radio instead of asking them to rise up.

But I generally disagree. The futility of the situation should be obvious to many ( not all ), if Greece gets overran within weeks and the British start evacuating their troops you maybe consider the possibility that regardless of your skill and bravery the opposing army can't be beaten.

&gt; If you want to make the point that the British commanders knew early on this was a lost fight and should have instructed the resistance to give up that's a whole different discussion. It's possible the High Command knew they were sending many civilians into their deaths just to hold up the Germans for a little bit. Which (if true) again shows you what I tried explaining earlier. No morality, no law, this was a total war.

This is a topic I have thought about quite a lot and my opinion sounds rather unpleasant but I have little doubt that this is a topic that was badly managed by the Allies and governments in exile.

I think everyone should be able to live anywhere in the world **as** **long** **as** the immigrants go through a fine mesh sieve while entering. Most countries don't have one cohesive way of life that everyone subscribe to. The ones you have now in your country are our dregs. They are not liked in Turkey, too. Most Turkish immigrants in Europe went there during post ww2 because factories needed unqualified male workers to man the menial labor positions. Rural, uneducated, unemployed people with nothing to lose flocked to your countries. I assure you, you would be perfectly fine with educated, respectful, mindful, tactful Turks. We are not that few and far in between. I am an immigrant and I knew that from the first day I was a guest in someone else's country and I had to be respectful, integrate daily life and be an example of a Turk so people get to know me would think better of my nation. I upheld those values more than 10 years now and none is surprised I am accepted now; not as a polite guest but a fellow of the folk here. Didn't lose my culture, didn't lose my values.

4199,"I follow geopolitics pretty closely and to be honest, INSTEX is not going to maintain the JCPOA. INSTEX allows European Importers/Exporters and Iranian Importers/Exporters to trade internally. Using this mechanism yes, they can avoid the US financial system to some extent. However this only covers a small portion of Iranian trade.

In addition, INSTEX does not protect companies the way they think it does. In the US, the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 mean that the SEC has the permission to require all US-listed companies to disclose certain business activities with Iran. Under the TRA, the SEC  could require disclosure of INSTEX transactions functionally allowing the treasury to move around this special purpose vehicle. This would basically negate the effects of INSTEX.

Another issue is that the TRA requires disclosure of all financial interactions with the  Government of Iran, any political subdivision, agency etc.  Although INSTEX is technically European, it's tied to the Iranian gov't may be interpreted as such which would give the US legal authority to require disclosure if they choose to avoid SEC guidance.  The TRA is a very broad law, and violating it can lead to serious implications for participating companies. Using this, the US could pressure European companies into choosing between Iran and the US with the threat of enforcement of the TRA.

Under it's current structure, INSTEX transactions are very transparent, and it's difficult to make them less so.

That said, it is a warning sign of opposition to US sanctions policy and it shows that in a post Trump world, the US is going to have to be more careful about using unilateral sanctions and will have to favor multilateral sanctions where possible.",,/r/europe/comments/c6wzqn/eu_mechanism_for_trade_with_iran_now_operational/esc5w0q/,Martingale-G,1561821755

They usually give millions and millions of state funding to NGOs who are actively working on harming our economy and social stability, causing drama and crises to increase their power, funding as well as general green and leftie lobby power. Sometimes direct funding but often even way more € of indirect through projects from other state funded institutions. Best example is ""Deutsche Umwelthilfe"" who are actively blackmailing the German taxpayer, companies and suing state institutions already causing insane damages. 
Any reasonable government would fight against these institutions not support them and make them grown in power and have to give in to ever more insane demands and give them more funding to shut them up again which is basically what happened.

The mayor of Lampedusa said that during the last few days SW3 waited to be allowed to dock in Italy, more than 200 migrants reached Lampedusa by themselves.
Some say NGOs helped reducing deaths among those who try to cross the Mediterranean sea, others say that they're facilitating the exploitation of migrants by human smugglers.

When I read that this sort of migration is an Italian problem and that people hope we have a plan, I fear there's a big misunderstanding, to say the least, or a stunning amount of hypocrisy.
The agreements reached in Dublin deputize the regularization of migrants to the countries they first set foot on.
With that excuse southern european countries like Italy are left alone in this crisis.
It was rather stupid for Italian politicians to sign such a pact, but they don't really ever shine for intelligence (they ALL are a joke to me). It is quite deceiving for French, German, Dutch, (insert other northern European nationality), governments to ignore this fact and not realize that this is a European crisis that needs to be addressed as a union.
This is why Europe was created, to be able to work together to solve similar issues.

If Europe keeps ignoring the fact that Italy by itself can't solve it, were I the Italian government I would just welcome any migrant, give them papers to freely travel across Europe and say: ""Go wherever the fuck you want!"".

Side note: the solution of paying African  countries like Libya or Sudan to withhold migrations lead to the creation of detention camps, which is unacceptable to me.

Also, why add nuclear into a grid with lots of renewables that desperately needs plants like gas plants for balancing. Renewables basically destroy the concept about base and peak load.

4727,"&gt; More relevantly, let’s look to the last war that had been had between Germany and France.

Yes, let's look at that one indeed: France was beaten, occupied, surrendered and then agreed to the pay in a peace treaty because, let's not mince words here, to the victors the spoils. That's brutal, honest, old-fashioned way of waging war in Europe up to that point. 

Quite tellingly, none of those questions can seriously be raised about the *Second* World War, because it's as clear as day who's done what. 

Which is precisely the opposite of what happened in Versailles and the main reason why the Nazis and the revanchists were able to make hay out of it. The First World War was the fist known incidence where the power that mobilised its forces the last was dubbed the ""aggressor"" and assigned all guilt and had to surrender although not a single inch of its soil was occupied. 

Why? Because it was offered a 'peace with honour', which would indeed have been more like peace of exhaustion of all sides resulting from a stalemat - which it basically was hadn't the US stepped into it, picked winners and losers, then reneged on all its promises, turned around and made it into a humiliating defeat for one side only, where tens of thousands of civilians had to die after the fact because the naval blockade persisted for months.

*That's* what made it into the holy mess it was. I mean, in the end it was so bad that even Lloyd George had to call for restraint on his side of the rope, and there's a reason why people like John Maynard Keynes and George Bernard Shaw clairvoyantly thought of the 'peace' at hand as being the setup for the next war.",Charlemagnia - personally vouching for /u/-ah,/r/europe/comments/c6h4q2/100_years_ago_the_treaty_of_versailles_was_signed/esbd9wr/,ColourFox,1561786846

At the same time in Finland it's highly unrecommended to hug anyone other than your closest friends, but in many Southern countries it's totally ok to hug your colleagues or any friends, even those you barely know - NOT doing that is considered as creep. Personally, I don't like hugs and kisses, while in Russia all female friends tend to hug you when you meet them or as goodbye, while in France and Turkey many girls (and guys) kiss you on cheek. Do I consider it rude, insulting or harassing? Definitely not. The same is about ""sexual"" jokes: the same joke can be considered as appropriate and neutral in Russia but totally unacceptable and explicit in Turkey.

If the Americans ratified the damn thing.

The French had originally intended to partition the Rhineland entirely out from Germany as a security buffer, but the Americans were appalled by this, and talked Clemenceau into leaving the Rhineland in Germany in exchange for extending an Anglo-American guarantee of France's borders, so that if ever a second war break out the UK and USA would immediately be obligated to come to France's defence.

Wilson put his name on the treaty but failed to get his own Congress to ratify it, and America went full isolationist mode immediately after. The UK later said that with the Americans out they were out too.

4878,"It's ""ideologies"". 

Thatcherism is not universally praised by economists. It created high unemployment, to levels not seen in the UK since the Great Depression. Her housing policies distorted the property market and created an artificial boom. Many say that Tatcher's policies have contributed to the current housing crisis.

&gt; Thatcher's legacy: her role in today's housing crisis

https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/aug/26/right-to-buy-margaret-thatcher-david-cameron-housing-crisis

https://journals.openedition.org/osb/808

&gt; This paper first outlines the changing housing market that John Major inherited when he came to power in the United Kingdom, in November 1990. Indeed, after a few years of uninterrupted boom the market faltered and went into recession. It then reviews some of the housing policies implemented by the John Major government, and considers whether these mark a shift away from Thatcherite housing policies. It suggests that, paradoxically, John Major pressed on with many of his predecessor’s policies despite them having brought about the housing crisis and being discredited. However, it argues that the last years of the government saw a change in policy. The government was faced with the consequences of his predecessor’s policies and forced to act on them. These new priorities paved the way for his successor’s policies.

4897,"Well, it’s a huge &amp; resource rich country with abundant populations in states with different climates that also only has two neighbors that are both relatively small economically, most of everything else has to take the cost of coming over oceans. So in that sense it seems reasonable that in many cases there wouldn’t be that much competitive advantage to international trade to make it that important.

Whereas European countries are often somewhat small going by land and are more likely to have internally consistent climates and not have so many resources on account of them having been exploited for a longer period of time, or have had different industrial priorities. It’s a harder to supply the need domestically and it is also very easy to transport goods from the abundance of nearby countries that may have better regulations or prior investment or climate to support a particular good, therefore international trade is more important and there’s more of a focus on how to be competitive in trade.

The world bank has some interesting [data](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NE.TRD.GNFS.ZS) on how big trade is compared to GDP by countries and regions, it’s hugely important to most EU countries relative to the rest of the world but to North America (particularly the US) trade is relatively unimportant.",Mississippi,/r/europe/comments/c6in00/what_the_iran_crisis_reveals_about_european_power/esawzed/,sparkling_uranium,1561771332

The first term has generally fallen from contemporary usage; the second term has stuck. The modern term for the former is Netilat yadayim, washing of hands.

Honestly, the 1960s looked a lot worse. Washington DC's GDP per capita was literally stunted for 20 years after the massive riots caused by MLK's assassination. Not to mention the Vietnam War (which literally had US soldiers murdering their own officers towards the end of it), a president being shot, almost having nuclear war, race riots constantly, etc. On the grand scheme of things, the 21st century has been pretty good

Maybe I'm an optimist because I lived in the third world myself and witnessed the dramatic growth and ""rise of the rest"" that has been occurring in this modern age. My main concern is climate change, the current state of the USA today quite frankly looks petty and forgettable in the future.

We still don't know who this new guy will be (just like noone expected that Putin will endorse Medvedev in 2008).

Regarding the oligarchs, this is where I say the west has made a great mistake. The west should never have allowed the oligarchs in power after the fall of the SU. Unfortunately they did. Now, a good Russian president of would fight to completely eliminate the oligarchs without compromise, not cozying up to them and protecting their interests like Putin.

* The final design wasn't something invented just for this specific car.

Most importantly:
&gt;None were actually delivered to any holder of the completed saving stamp books, though one Type 1 Cabriolet was presented to Hitler on 20 April 1944 (his 55th birthday).

The ""Volkswagen"" as it was intended and as we know didn't even come into existence during the Nazi regime. Only after the war was when production for civilian cars actually started.

5319,"&gt; Somehow I forgot about Crimea, lol. I´ve always thought that a solution could be to make crimea an independent ´neutral´ state like Austria in the days of the SU, with the excuse of ´giving the people of Crimea another chance to decide their future´. This way Russia, Europe, and Ukraine would all save face. If we get creative, maybe Crimea could be an independent state under shared Ukrainian and Russian sovereignty. It would be a first, but if done in good faith it is not undoable.
To make them independent is surely a bold move. But what if local politicians immediately call for the next referendum and they vote for joining Russia again? The West as well as Ukraine will not be happy about it. 
&gt; I might be wrong about this since I am not an expert on current Russian politics, but I don´t believe there are many candidates out there that have Putin´s ´charisma´. 
Of course, Putin’s charisma is quite unique and most people around him aren’t good at public appearances, interviews, negotiations. However, someone like Sobyanin or Shoygu could easily win if he has no real opponents.
&gt; If so, there only needs to be a scandal, recession or some other sort domestic problem in order to see the whole thing crumble down without Putin being able to unify the country, and it wouldn´t surprise me if some people are already gathering incriminating information on potential candidates right now just to release it when its convenient.
I think different fraction of Kremlin already prepare for fight and once Putin formally announces he’s not going to run in the next cycle (he constitutionally can’t anyway but who knows what he may think of) there’ll be a lot of rumors and dirty information coming on pretty much everyone. The problem is that as the result of this mess we may get two bad candidates who can win and a bunch of irrelevant ones, which means no chances of improving relationships with EU. 
The reason I mentioned Duma election is that United Russia, a ruling party, is very unpopular now, compared to its 10 years old positions, so it would be interesting to see what kind of strategy will Putin use, will he make the election more competitive, or maybe there’ll be a new party which is pro-Putin but critical of United Russia, or a relatively big opposition party will appear. No matter how much of information, insight or analysis I read on Telegram, it’s all very unclear.

There are hotels and restaurants in the Old Town of my city, they have AC.

Somehow I forgot about Crimea, lol.

This way Russia, Europe, and Ukraine would all save face. If we get creative, maybe Crimea could be an independent state under shared Ukrainian and Russian sovereignty. It would be a first, but if done in good faith it is not undoable.

It is true that we don´t really know what a post-Putin election would like apart from the old guard presenting a replacement. I might be wrong about this since I am not an expert on current Russian politics, but I don´t believe there are many candidates out there that have Putin´s ´charisma´. If so, there only needs to be a scandal, recession or some other sort domestic problem in order to see the whole thing crumble down without Putin being able to unify the country, and it wouldn´t surprise me if some people are already gathering incriminating information on potential candidates right now just to release them when its convenient.

5563,"&gt;But in recent days, a group of Muslim women called Citizen’s Alliance of Grenoble has twice turned up to pools in the city at the foot of the French Alps wearing the burkini. 
&gt;
&gt;In their first attempt, around 15 women managed to enter the pool on May 17 and filmed themselves bathing, saying they had done so ""to defend freedom of religion”. Last Sunday, a group were fined €35 (£30) each for doing so.
&gt;
&gt;Undaunted, they have called on Facebook for a third “operation burkini” this Sunday, claiming they are the “Muslim Rosa Parks” of France, a nod to the US civil rights icon.
&gt;
&gt;In response to the high-profile action, Grenoble residents have launched a rival “citizens’ secular, ecologist” Facebook group called “Everyone Naked”, calling on all members to turn up to the pool “baring all” to take on the “burkini brigade”.

I think it's only sensible to question someone's reason for labeling people as bad when they are mostly known for being the voice of reason in a time of hardship (and being awarded the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought by the EU Parliament).

The true fallacy these days, I think, is that ""communism"" has been turned into a distorted boogeyman where some people continuously cherrypick from its worst/early excesses to misrepresent its tenets. Which I am skeptical about not because I think it's the best thing since sliced bread, but rather because of *another* fallacy where people go ""communism = socialism"", which in turn interferes with my belief in social-market economy as an optimal balance.

5709,"The only actual way to do that is to make more courts and are more judges. Of course, that's a lot of money. Not only for the new infrastructure that would be needed, without taking into account lots of the existing courts are in horrible conditions, with failing AC, leaking pipes, ceilings falling or just not enough personnel to properly carry out their function, but also all the new personnel that you would need to hire. And courts are still waiting for things like the digital case files to be finished after almost ten years! While the rest of the digital infrastructure still sucks ass. 

&amp;#x200B;

The only solution that the different governments and the Judiciary Council, both from PP and PSOE, have proposed to 'solve' this situation is to make the actual overworked judges (which have a laughably high ratio of citizens they must take care of compared to other European countries) to work even more, by giving economic incentives to make more sentences in a less amount of time! Or create to *more* specialized courts that will collapse after a month of being operative. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is the real drama of the Spanish Judiciary. The election of the Judiciary Council is a laughable matter compared to this. And nobody wants to address it, even if the judges have started to go into strikes for the first time in their history to get the politicians to address it.

5738,"&gt;And as an Irishmen, I hope to God we never raise our corporate taxes, the benefit it brings to our economy is incomprehensible.

The problem here was never our corporate tax rates, but specific agreements with specific corporations such as Apple that [allowed them to pay no tax whatsoever](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/06/new-york-times-digital-the-paradise-papers-after-a-tax-crackdown-apple-found-a-new-shelter-for-its-profits.html) :

 

&gt;In May 2013, the Senate’s investigative subcommittee released a  142-page report on Apple’s tax avoidance, finding that the company was  attributing billions of dollars in profits each year to **three Irish  subsidiaries that declared “tax residency” nowhere in the world.**  
&gt;  
&gt;Under  Irish law, if a company can convince Irish tax authorities that it is  “managed and controlled” abroad, it can largely escape Irish income tax.  By seeming to run its Irish subsidiaries from its world headquarters in  California, Apple ensured that Irish tax residency was avoided.  
&gt;  
&gt;At  the same time, American law dictated that the subsidiaries were only  tax residents in the United States if incorporated there. The federal  government permits taxes on any income generated by foreign units to be  deferred indefinitely, as long as the company says those profits stay  offshore.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Apple has sought the holy grail of tax avoidance:  offshore corporations that it argues are not, for tax purposes, resident  anywhere in any nation,” then-Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan,  who was the subcommittee chairman, said at the 2013 hearing.

5752,"&gt; Yes, and what was the impact of Putin's first 13 years until the Crimea crisis?

The annexation of crimea was not some kind of inevitable natural disaster but something putin willingly did, knowing what the consequences would be. So *he* is responsible for the economic downturn resulting from that.

&gt; You could blame Putin for not diversifying the economy/diversifying it too late

Yes you can and should.

&gt; almost the entire infrastructure and housing in rural areas comes from Soviet times, modern Russia has produced almost nothing on her own

Now that's not really flattering for Putin. As I said, he had 20 years to improve the situation.

&gt; o inherit then an economy that is also massively corrupt and kleptocratic, and a political situation where you need to worry about being couped or assassinated if you don't cater to specific corrupt elements is no easy task.

Except that never in human history has a communist state ever done promoted that. We judge every other government form by its physical real life examples, like democracies or fascism. Why should communism be any different?

&gt;People who want to rule use what ever that is convenient for them, what ever takes them to power, even if it's only a shell of the actual ideology.

Agreed.

&gt;The same justification for being against say, capitalism could be used as it's been a regime of murderous regimes that massacred millions. 

As an economic system I think its fair to criticise it and argue that it killed millions of people in the name of profit. After all, it is simply the truth, just like communist states being brutal and oppressive dictatorships.

5856,"&gt;When was it ever in question that war in Ukraine is more important than the plane 

From what I've seen (not much but still) Ukrainian media somehow talked more about the plane, than about anything else, and the OP does the same, which is kind of interesting.

&gt;the reality is much worse 

Is it because Russian aggression and recklessness are actually not that bad or there is something truly terrible ahead? Let's see.

&gt;Russia is sneakily and deliberately manipulating elections 

I see. Russia posting a couple of obscure memes that nobody saw is definitely a greatest threat we have to face. Because people in the old democracies are stupid enough to not know whom to vote for unless Russia shows them with their couple of memes and the media that nobody watches. Because it surely never happened before in the Western world, that people in one country express their opinion about some political issues in another country. Or Western media talking about political issues in other countries. Or funding political movements with a certain agenda in other countries. Or constantly saying which politicians in other countries are good and which ones are bad. Or supporting one side in an internal civil conflict.

&gt;bribing politicians 

Maybe you think that the vote in PACE happened because everybody was bribed, but it's not what happened most certainly. Even Ukrainian media didn't believe that, which tells a lot. Again, from what I've seen.

&gt;If Russia succeeds in its aim to dismantle the EU 

Believe it or not there is no aim to dismantle the EU for Russia. First of all it's impossible anyways. Secondly Russia has issues with NATO and American influence and not the EU per se. If the EU stops trying to get into post-Soviet space, what's the problem with the EU would be for Russia? Dealing with the chaos of completely dismantled EU is not even good.

&gt;Brexit, Trump and Salvini 

Yeah Russia totally did all of that, because everybody in the UK and the US have no opinions of their own and Russia is so popular there that everyone just follows what Russia says and votes accordingly immediately.

&gt;Electing Trump is the worst thing to happen to Earth's climate 

Because up to 2016 everything was totally going according to plan and now it's a complete disaster and all is ruined in just two years. And all that is because of Russia of course. I'm sure Russia also picks candidates for Democrats as well, because how else can you explain that they managed to pick the only candidate that was less popular than Trump. Surely they couldn't do it on their own accord.

&gt;Russia has also spread anti-vaccine conspiracies and thusly contributed to lower vaccination rates and disease spread. 

Looks like too many people injected too many conspiracies about Russia into their heads. I think it's a dangerous pandemic because it makes people blind to real problems and makes them act in a weird and funny way.

&gt;And you just act like there's nothing to be upset about? 

There are always things to be upset about. But I don't think that new McCarthyism is a way to go.

&gt;All the terrorists in the Middle can't hurt Europe as much as Russia does by getting the West to punch itself in the face. 

I'm sure those terrorists are nothing compared to those horrendous Russian memes. Those memes deal permanent damage, I tell you. 

But if you are the guy, who repeatedly punches himself in the face, and then repeatedly accuses the neighbor behind the fence for doing that, maybe just maybe you should begin with reconsidering your general view of the world a little bit.

Several years have passed and people are still in denial that there are problems inside the West with big groups of people who are really pissed because they have their own reasons.

Hydrogen is also another candidate for the future, just that it has high losses to produce it and it's hard to store, but compared to electricity easier to store.

And the last option is to go a step further and go Carbon Capture and Usage, with Methane. Easy to store, easy to fill up your car, the infrastructure is already in place. But even higher losses when we talk production.

5983,"Freud would be delighted to analyze the broad range of maladaptive and immature defense mechanisms when it comes to the car industry and governments. Denial, rationalizations, you name it. Let's ban cars left and right by &lt;insert here random date&gt; without having any plans to adapt the infrastructure. With the huge, crowded and many times old real estate that we have, which is in great part in many cities either dedicated to rent from investment funds or rich private citizens, or is rather used to buy and flip by the middle class to make a buck, who do you think is gonna invest all that money to adapt the infrastructure? The very volatile job market makes even private owners unsure of what will happen tomorrow to be sure they'll still be there 5 years from now. An electric car is simply not a portable car, it's tied to a pretty short and fixed charger. Meanwhile they kill the old car industry and scare people off buying a much needed means of transportation which could help them get a better job in an area that has a much too high unemployment rate for such a supposedly modern continent. But no, bwaa haaa waa, something something corporate evil, evil private transportation, climate change...

There are many things you can complain about in that directive, but how is this not just straight up copyright law? The newspapers write an article, they own the copyright on the text, what's wrong with them being able to determine who can use it? I know there's a stream of copyright anarchists that would like to abolish copyright altogether, but I don't think you can say ""allow newspapers to own copyright on the articles they make"" is particularly novel.",The Netherlands,/r/europe/comments/c68dcr/united_states_president_on_vestager_eu/es8kz6b/,silent_cat,1561701903

The US, China, and Russia have each sought to challenge or disrupt the existing, post-1945 world order; and each seeks to divide Europeans from one another.
The turmoil in the current system represents an opportunity for Europeans to shape a new order that meets their strategic needs.
In addition to the fight against climate change, European interests include: increasing stability on its troubled periphery; managing migration more effectively; and defending the open world trading system.
European countries will need to transform EU foreign policy decision-making processes, deepen their cooperation in multilateral settings, and set multilateral standards for emerging technologies.",Luxembourg,/r/europe/comments/c6gkgg/rescuing_multilateralism/es8l0oc/,JackRogers3,1561701952
