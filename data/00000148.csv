1,"&gt;A multicultural, single Europe doesn't mean you have to erase culture at all.

If you stick a bunch of cultures in a blender together, you end up with a uni-culture like America. Are there any distinguishing features between Irish and German American culture you can name today?

&gt;I have no idea what the point is of the rest of your comment, but quoting the Telegraph as a news source... dude.

The source is irrelevant, the picture was the point. It's a leftist European leader proudly posing for a photo doing a far-right hand gesture. It illustrates the continued cooperation between European leftists and formerly Nazi aligned Islamist groups that I mentioned.

Another example is [anti-Semitic pogroms in Paris,](https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/mvnbyv/manifestation-palestine-gaza-paris-barbes-197) jointly organized by leftist and Islamist groups. Leftists marched about screaming ""anti-fascist"" slogans and comparing the Israeli government to the Nazis, meanwhile their Islamist friends ransacked Jewish businesses, firebombed synagogues, and [spray painted swastikas,](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/08/02/world/ANTISEMITISM/ANTISEMITISM-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale) whilst waving far-right MB flags.",,/r/europe/comments/cr3li9/the_myth_of_eurabia_how_a_farright_conspiracy/ex4v8dn/,WookieInHeat,1566011555

24,"It's not the official name of the country. But language and usage is a bit looser than that and it is used in many contexts including official contexts to refer to the entire country including Northern Ireland.

The official ISO country codes for the country are GB and GBR, not UK. They use ""GB"" on their numberplates, even in Northern Ireland. Their Olympic team is branded ""Team GB"".

This is further amplified by the denonyms for the country being ""Britain"" not ""UK"", like it is the *British* government, not the *UK* government, *British* citizen, not ""Citizen of the UK"" etc.

The Oxford English Dictionary does record this usage in its definition of the word, as applying to the entire UK.

Some took the vegetable soup with a ladleful of rice inside.

The second course was either meat or fish, with pork-free options for muslims and fish on Friday for those observing religious/lent fasting. Always with a side of boiled vegetables (carrots, potatoes, spinach, green beans) or baked potatoes.

Because Finland was under Russian rule as the Grand Duchy of Finland for about a hundred years after the Finnish War, in which is was taken from Sweden by the victor of the war, Russia. The Grand Duke of Finland was not a vassal of the Tsar of Russia, nor a Romanov relative of the Tsar, but the Tsar themself. Not only that, but in addition to the grand duke of the territory being the Russian Tsar, the territory was also administered by a Governor-General. Finland may have been autonomous, and it retained the name ""Grand Duchy of Finland"" (the Swedish King formerly being the Grand Duke of Finland), it was still a part of the Russian Empire. An autonomous one, but a part of it nonetheless. It would be like saying Australia were not a part of the British Empire during the 1800s and the first third of the 1900s.

105,"&gt; Article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights provides that “no one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation. 

You've cited article 12, but incomplete. For completeness, here is the full definition, appropriately sourced. The missing part is bolded.

&gt; Article 12.
 
&gt; No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation. **Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.**

https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/

You then think you're clever, and switch both context and sources without indication, obscuring this switch:

&gt; Privacy can be defined as the presumption that individuals should have an area of. autonomous development, interaction and liberty, a “private sphere” with or without. 

You've likely found a definition contained in a 2013 OHCHR report, responding to the Snowden leaks. It pops up in the top of my Google search. The OHCHR refers to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. 

However, this definition is neither an ""official definition"" of the U.N., nor does it imply privacy cannot exist in the public sphere. Namely, the OHCHR in turn cites ""Lord Lester and D. Pannick (eds.). Human Rights Law and Practice. London, Butterworth, 2004, para. 4.82.""

[Scholars have never found complete consensus on what constitutes a definitive definition of privacy](http://publicatio.bibl.u-szeged.hu/10794/7/3188699.pdf) (Page 258, PDF page 3)

You'd be interested, then, that in 2015, in the wake of the Snowden leaks, the OHCHR decided to appoint a Special Rapporteur on the right to privacy:

&gt; In April 2015, the Human Rights Council adopted resolution 28/16 at its twenty-eighth session, deciding to appoint for a period of three years a Special Rapporteur on the right to privacy. The resolution directed the Special Rapporteur, amongst other responsibilities, to report on alleged violations of the right to privacy including in connection with the challenges arising from new technologies. States were called upon to cooperate fully and assist the Special Rapporteur.

https://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/DigitalAge/Pages/DigitalAgeIndex.aspx

This Special Rapporteur was [Prof. Joseph Cannataci](https://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Privacy/SR/Pages/SRPrivacyIndex.aspx). 

**Here is what Special Rapporteur on the right to privacy, professor Joseph Cannataci had to say about CCTV:**

&gt; **However, Cannataci says we are dealing with a world even worse that anything Orwell could have foreseen. “It’s worse,” he said. “Because if you look at CCTV alone, at least Winston [Winston Smith in Orwell’s novel 1984] was able to go out in the countryside and go under a tree and expect there wouldn’t be any screen, as it was called. Whereas today there are many parts of the English countryside where there are more cameras than George Orwell could ever have imagined. So the situation in some cases is far worse already.**

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/24/we-need-geneva-convention-for-the-internet-says-new-un-privacy-chief

Not only that, they wrote another report in 2018. There is quite an interesting bit at page 3:

&gt; **The protection of the right to privacy is not limited to private, secluded spaces, such as the home of a person, but extends to public spaces and information that is publicly available (see CCPR/C/COL/CO/7, para. 32). For example, the right to privacy comes into play when a Government is monitoring a public space, such as a marketplace or a train station, thereby observing individuals.**

&gt; The beginnings of the Peace of God movement lay in Peace assemblies, which were religious gatherings usually held in open fields. At these assemblies, the relics of saints would be displayed, and crowds of believers would come both to see the relics and to try to witness any miracles that may be caused by the relics. The local nobles and religious authorities would then publicly state laws regulating the soldiers’ actions, in order to prevent harm to non-combatants during battles. The soldiers would then publicly swear to abide by the laws. In a way, the Peace assemblies bear a resemblance to the American Temperance movement rallies of the late 1800s.

260,"A few weeks ago a chase happened near my apartment. Later I read about it in the newspaper: ""Wild West Berlin!"". 10 to 15 people are said to have staged a fight in the Schlüterstrasse in Berlin-Charlottenburg. When the police arrived, the men fled, with a larger group following two men. The one should have aimed with a pistol at his pursuers and also pressed. But no shot broke. After handing over the weapon to his colleague, he should have reloaded and pressed again. Again, no shot broke. When the Berlin police were able to confront the two men, they had already thrown away the weapon. Later, the officials found the sharp pistol on and around the nearby Kurfürstendamm, an unfolded knife and a telescopic baton. The whole action was apparently the aftermath of a brawl that had taken place in a Berlin club and in which the members of a criminal Arab clan should have been involved.

The area around the Schlüterstrasse is characterized by large-scale town houses from the turn of the century and good restaurants. The expensive boutiques of international fashion labels are just around the corner. Over the past few years, I've watched the area change. Above all, there are old-timers, well-fed commoners and a few happy workers with decades-old leases. The area is increasingly becoming the stage of dubious figures. Smart cars drive through the streets and park where it pleases. A neighbor told me a while ago that she had asked one of the gentlemen to park his car. The answer was: ""Shut up, you old cunt.""

All in all, it is apparent that in Berlin, an environment whose outlines are not very clear is increasingly coming to the fore. If you think the activities of criminal clans are limited to a few streets in Neukölln or Wedding, you're wrong.

Robberies and murders

Criminal Arab clans have caused a stir in recent years with spectacular robberies. They looted a jewelery department in Berlin's department store in the middle of the day, they stole a hundred-kilogram gold coin from the Berlin Bode Museum and blew up a Berliner Sparkasse. In addition, there are brutal murders that have also taken place in the realm of criminal clans. In Berlin-Neukölln, a man was beaten to death with a baseball bat. In the vicinity of the former Tempelhof airport, an intensive offender was killed with eight shots. For his funeral in Berlin-Schöneberg 2000 guests appeared. The police registered more than a hundred criminal clan members. It was a pretty impressive company.

The presence of the clans has also increased at other levels. Wealth and success are more clearly displayed, for example in the form of expensive and tuned cars. Investigators find that younger clan members are less modest. Shisha bars literally spring up in the city. Some are actually well attended. But many are mostly empty. For some of them, there simply has not been an entrepreneurial success. For others, this does not matter because the shisha bar anyway only serves to purify money, which is piled up by means of protection racketeering, drug trafficking, prostitution and robberies. The success of the authorities in the fight against clan crime are rather modest. For one thing, the clans have very good defense lawyers, on the other hand almost nobody wants to testify against them. Witnesses suddenly do not remember or withdraw their statements.

Germany as a self-service store

""The clans regard society as a prey society,"" says Ralph Ghadban, a German Islamic scholar who grew up in Lebanon and now lives in Berlin. He published the book ""Arab Clans - The Underestimated Danger"" in 2018. After massive threats from the clan milieu, he is now under permanent police protection.

Criminal clans are likely to perceive Germany as a self-service store; as a kind of Disneyland, where you do not even have to pay admission. The fact that many members also receive social assistance from the state in addition to their criminal activities, should strengthen their impression that they are dealing with naive idiots in Germany. In the patriarchal structure of the clans, ""honor"" is a central concept - and, of course, ""respect"". But respect is primarily owed to the stronger. The German state has so far made no impression on the clans.

De-escalation is counterproductive

German policing is reaching its limits. Affected is not only Berlin, but also Bremen, Lower Saxony and North Rhine-Westphalia. ""Der Spiegel"" quoted from a clan report of the State Criminal Police Office of North Rhine-Westphalia from 2018. It is an expansion of clan crime recorded. Usual police measures did not continue, says the report. Reassuring behavior is ""in the milieu of clan members only in rare cases expedient."" De-escalation is even counterproductive, since ""such behavior is interpreted as a weakness of the police or the state"". Police actions are extremely costly even for comparatively harmless offenses. Within a very short time, clan people mobilize their supporters over the phone.

Basically, the problems with criminal Arabian extended families have been known for a long time. Figures that seem to play a significant role today appeared in police reports shortly after the turn of the millennium. Even then, they let nothing say threatened officials and intimidated witnesses. Why did not you do a lot of work? A misunderstood consideration for foreigners should play a central role. The official admission that there is a clan problem in Germany would have attacked the idea of ​​a peaceful, multicultural society. That was probably not very opportune. Even today, there are many critics who reject only the term ""criminal extended family"" because he takes innocent people in clanship.

It is clear that not all family members who have a specific name are criminal. At the same time, this form of organized crime can only be understood by taking the ""family"" component seriously. Because they are criminal family businesses, into which many members grow. The authorities note that criminal acts are often committed by perpetrators under the age of 21 because they are covered by juvenile justice. The concept of the family also leads to a completely different relationship and confidentiality. An exit from the organization is much more difficult than with other criminal networks. Indiscretions are rare, secrecy is great. Since the patriarchal structured families are often very rich in children, there also seems to be no problems with new blood.

With their negligence, the authorities have made the clans really big. Law enforcement is only partially deterrent. An arrest seems to be a kind of initiation rite in parts of this milieu: ""jail makes men.""

The keyboard of intimidation

The German Achilles heel has apparently recognized the clans: the fear of being accused of racism and discrimination. The authorities in Germany react to this, due to their own history, perhaps as sensitively as nowhere else. My colleague Jonas Hermann was just for a reportage in Essen. The harder stance against clans is seen in Arab milieus partly as a racist campaign of the state. For the clans, not only the threat of violence is part of the intimidation, but also the charge of racism. In the extreme form he was in Essen like this: ""We are the new Jews."" Criminal clans, as clan members want to tell society, are an authority fantasy.

In the meantime, politics has recognized the clan problem. Nobody could say that it would be kept secret in the media. Some may think the warnings about the criminal clan exaggerated; but that the state must defend itself against them should be consensus among the whole society. This constellation also carries a danger: There is no political dispute over how to fight the clans. In North Rhine-Westphalia, the police makes the life of the clans with raids a little harder. The local Minister of the Interior Herbert Reul was demonstratively involved in such police actions. The signal is clear: Here, the boss takes care of the matter. In Berlin, the authorities have confiscated real estate from clan members. This was possible because the burden of proof was reversed. Now the clans have to prove

These measures are far from sufficient. In the fight against the clan crime probably quite a different robustness and hardness is required. Above all, it needs witness protection programs that really protect people who are willing to testify. Only then can the crimes be punished in the future. It also takes elaborate drop-out programs that allow willing to leave the clan structure. Probably you have to be even stricter income proof. The police need more skills to intercept the clans. In the case of intensive detainees, who have repeatedly been criminalized, the judiciary might have to crack harder.

Integrate or create

The current problems with the clans should above all be a wake-up call in the asylum debate. Many clan members are so-called Mhallamiye Kurds. Originally they came from Turkey, but then moved to Lebanon. When the civil war broke out there in the 1970s, some of them came to Germany. Here they applied for asylum mostly unsuccessful. Because they were either stateless or had no passports, they were not expelled. The authorities hoped they would eventually go by themselves. They did not leave. They stayed here without work and without being integrated into this society. This form of being proved fatal. It is probably not exaggerated to see in it the foundation for the later criminal activities.

Germany has received more than one million asylum seekers in recent years. The country must do everything in its power to integrate it. At the same time, those who have no perspective here must be scrapped. As self-evident as it sounds, it is not.",,/r/europe/comments/creghc/germany_the_disneyland_for_criminal_clans_german/ex45qjz/,d_agostino,1565999024

293,"&gt;It opposes the Western style liberalism that promotes things like feminism.

Socialists were never in favour of western style liberalism to begin with, in fact they treated/treat it as an ideological enemy so of course the CCP rejects western liberal principles just like Lenin rejected those principles in the early 20th century. They were liberal insofar as they advocated for women's suffrage, their right to education and the full integration of women in the workforce. However, socialists never went further than that, they were still very much in favor of family values and they rejected the core of liberal ideology which is individualism. Granted they were very much against ethno nationalism and racism which is another similarity with liberalism, however socialists gradually developed their own version of left-wing nationalism which varied from country to country. For example in Yugoslavia, Yugoslav nationalism was promoted intensively by the government.

It's a very recent phenomenon where socialists teamed up with progressive liberals and adopted almost every progressive idea and march under rainbow flags instead of under the hammer and sickle. Personally I disagree with the current trend on the left because the obsession with LGBT and minorities alienates native-born working people which is why they have lately started to support the far right . 

&gt;All of these have gone beyond conservatism and become radical, reactionary parties that seek to change the status quo into more authoritarian systems.

I don't think so. For Republicans I agree that they went too far to the right although they were already very right wing before Trump was even in the political scene. However I don't think that PiS and the Tories are fascist or even reactionary. Poland has always been a  conservative country so there's nothing reactionary about PiS's views. Gay marriage and abortion were never legal in Poland, they are preserving the status quo, which means that PiS is a standard conservative party by your very own definition. As for the Tories, their policies haven't changed, they are still very socially liberal, while Brexit can hardly be described as a right wing policy.

297,"So you are saying that all of the media who have said that one of the parts of the good friday agreement is that there will be no hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland are wrong? Hmm? You don't think anyone else would have pointed that out then? Why do the politicians all say so? Why do american politicians say so? Why do EU politicians say so? How come you are the first person I ever heard of to say the good friday agreement has nothing to do with it? **Are you insane?**

&gt;Urm, yes they are? 

**Urm, no they are not?** The other countries in the EU would **never** allow an open border to an outside country that's not part of the common market. It goes against the common market. What about this are you not getting?? 

&gt;The Irish Government have stated that on no condition will that border be built, see Simon Coveney's comments.

They are saying that the backstop is an absolute neccessity, because they will not allow the hard border to return. Do you seriously not see the difference compared to what you are trying to say they are saying? They are saying there **must not** be a return of border checks. They are saying there **must be** some form of checks, and are looking into how it may all work out. Again, the rest of the EU will never allow an open border to a third country, what the hell do you think this is? Do you think individual countries within the common market are allowed to do whatever they wish? AGAIN, that defeats the purpose of a common market. 

&gt;Are you stating that major cooperations would engage in illegal smuggling because it would be easy to do? You're talking shit.

Smuggling? They wouldn't smuggle. They would be acting completely within the law. **WHAT ARE YOU NOT GETTING HERE??** You are living in a fantasy land. It would be 100% legal for anyone to move anything across that border. It's not smuggling. It's buying something in one country and taking it to another country, because there's no border, no customs, nothing. 

And it doesn't even have to be about major corporations, it's just as bad for private persons to be able to import anything like that. 

A couple of months from now, you'll see. A hard brexit means border checks between the UK and the EU. It's that simple.

319,"&gt; Socially, the CCP is absolutely a conservative party.  
  
While I agree with your analysis about CCP's core ideology, I think you made a mistake on using words like ""conservatism"" or ""liberalism"" on Chinese politics.  
  
As a Chinese person myself, I always found many western internet users are unaware about the very popular belief ""denialism on legitimacy of mainstream western-oriented political spectrum"".  
  
Basically this kind thought argued so-called capitalist system and socialist/communist system are both ideologies completely developed by European philosophers themselves from 17th to 19th century, based on the social conditions in Europe only at that time. Those philosophers did not consider any opinions from the oriental world. And the problem is, most Chinese people don't think how basic rules about how society operates are the same between east and west. They do not accept such terminologies just being copied to their civilization which is parallel to the rest of world for 5000 years. There is a saying ""there are neither left-wing or right-wing in China because why we use where in a parliament hall a bunch of French revolutionaries sit (research: the origin of ""left"" and ""right"") to determine our politics of Middle Kingdom 200 years later? We should develop our own definitions on what is left-wing, what is right-wing.""  
  
Remember in the linguistic sense, a word itself doesn't have any meaning, only people's interpretations on it gives it meaning. Think about it: why we consider ideologies such as feminism, fall inside the category of ""liberalism""? Why there is no right-wing feminism? The people of the west just accepted how it is, but what would happen when majority of 1.4 billion Chinese population reject this definition?  
  
Mao was not saw as a leader of **pure ideological marxism-leninism** even when he is alive, in fact, certain percentage of low-rank Communist Party members in 1960s had no idea who Karl Marx is. The reason why PRC had majority support back in 1949 was they promotes Chinese Nationalism in name of socialism (which was seen as a left-wing ideology, until today, left-wing in China means you are a nationalist are anti-west).",China,/r/europe/comments/cr57ee/reurope_survey_results_opinion_on_european_leaders/ex3ryce/,PartrickCapitol,1565990386

353,"&gt; What was put in place in 2013 (and in addition, Virgin in 2014) was the result of pressure applied by the government and constitutes content filtering.

But you are still able to access the content.

&gt;In both cases, you downplayed, distorted and lied by omission about the scale and scope of the various programs

Simply no, the claim in each case was far in excess of the reality. 

&gt; Not only are you quote mining my quote, no, that's not just ""the tick box"". That's forcing ISPs into blocking and content filtering.

No as the ISP does not block it and as mentioned in the government documents I cited they believe any further responsibility should go to the content host and not the ISP. - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_verification_system#United_Kingdom

&gt;websites that publish pornography on a commercial basis would be required to implement a ""robust"" age verification system

Yup ""robust"" http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2018/9780111173183/pdfs/ukdsiem_9780111173183_en.pdf


&gt; Perhaps you should express yourself more clearly if you claims are incomprehensible. You said ""lobbying Mindgeek"", not ""Mindgeek lobbying [...]"". Regardless, this is lying by omission. Pressure was applied by government onto ISPs.

I missed out the word ""by"".

&gt;Requirements to verify age with credit card or passport in person for mobile providers

As I pointed out before credit cards don't verify age in the UK. 

&gt;Device and network filtering imposed by various broadband providers (BT, Virgin, Sky, TalkTalk, Orange);

Just so you know Orange does not operate in the UK

&gt;* Content blocking on public WiFi networks;

Not really to do with the government, just common place on networks of organisations, but even still not even that wide spread.

&gt;* Web filtering in libraries and schools;

Something that was around long before these events and considering most schools in the UK have unsupervised access to the internet for their students who are minors, not doing this would first of all be moronic and second of see the schools under a breach of care as they are legally responsible for their students safety and wellbeing while onsite.

&gt;Widespread issues with overblocking:

Sure there was a big issue of this when ISP's first started, but slowly content got whitelisted and now issues are rare. They are more common on filter that different orgs have internally as many lack the technical support to maintain them. Arguably that would be a good case for ISP's to take charge or such things so it's not done at a small scale.

&gt; but the overarching criticism of British porn censorship and web filtering/blocking in both the public and the private sphere, pressured by the British government, is quite correct and entirely justified.

357,"Of course, the budget isn't the same as military ability or intent, but surely there is a fairly strong correlation. It's very hard to judge actual military capability so military spending will have to do. The difference between NATO's budget is 15 times that of Russia's in 2018. If you look at the total spending since the cold war ended the difference is even more extreme. That doesn't include the non-NATO countries in EU who would also be involved if a EU was attacked. Any aggression from Russia against EU or NATO would be suicide, why would Russia do something that gives USA an excuse to invade? Putin is many thing but stupid doesn't appear to be one of them. As far as I can tell, anyone who claims otherwise are either fools or liars.

&gt;IIRC there is only two real conscript armies of a significant size in Europe: Greece and Turkey. The others are either absolutely tiny: Estonia and Latvia. Or conscript on the paper only, i.e. conscript for a month or two, and the rest are professional.

It's a bit more than that (but less than I thought): [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription)

&gt;I'm not saying that Russia can do it today. Otherwise it would be already too late to talk about it, and Russian troops would be already in Lithuania. What I'm saying, that the difference is not as large as it might look from the spending numbers alone. And that Russia is changing its Army aggressively, and being a dictatorship it can pick up the pace way faster then Europe's democracies can.

Of course, they are trying to increase their capabilities and we should carefully monitor and make sure we stay a few steps ahead of any potential threat.

391,"&gt;No it wasn't, and that is explained in my previous comment. ISPs immediately went to work in 2013.

No **some** ISP's (infact very few) started work on a token effort with little government guidance. And then the mandatory bad that was talked about kept getting postponed and then canceled. I have linked to the government statement on this already.

&gt; Okay, so, it appears you've googled wildly and have then cited what you've seen without even reading or checking what it is you're actually citing.

I cited it further down in my comment.

&gt; You cite the same link two times

Sorry copy paste error

&gt; ink discusses a soften of plans in 2017 to mandate something that was already put in place in 2014 after pressuring all major ISPs covering approximately 95% of households.

No what was put into place in 2014 was not anywhere near the full scope of what had been proposed and covered non of the proposed mandatory requirements.

&gt; Under this approach the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) will gain the power to force ISPs into blocking porn websites that fail to put “tough age verification measures” in place.

In that sense the Government’s softer tone towards the existing self-regulation approach by ISPs may be a moot point

Yup thats the tick box saying you are 18 I mentioned before. As all other age verification tech relies on credit cards, which in the UK can be got before 18 and don't carry any age related info so renders them useless. It's also a bit of an issue for companies that sell booze online in the UK.


&gt; ne other big concern is that the drive to rid the internet of bad content could risk running into a conflict with freedom of speech and the perilously tedious issue of context. Lest we forget that there’s the problem of how you define “hatred” and “terrorism” online in the first place and then separate that from related content that may include criticism of the same subject, as well as satire, the right to cause offence, political free speech and so forth.

We can see a future where big commercial websites are all adopting automated filtering systems in order to keep themselves safe from the law, not least because manual validation of every piece of user submitted content would be impossible. But as a consequence those filters might easily end up removing harmless content and impacting free speech.

Yup this not really relevant to the claim of needing a porn license though is it. Yes there are times the filters block legitimate content, though as you've seen the ISP's still let you access this it just needs to be whitelisted by the user. The only sites out right blocked are by court order.

&gt;Quite a change from ""just lobbying Mindgeek"" and ""hurr durr popular meme lol"". Seems we are making some, albeit minimal, progress.

Not really, it was mindgeek lobbying government (here was the thid link I meant to post https://novaramedia.com/2019/04/13/the-uk-government-risks-facilitating-a-porn-monopoly/ and some extras https://www.ft.com/content/9913ba8e-942b-11e9-b7ea-60e35ef678d2 + https://www.inverse.com/article/31314-pornhub-mindgeek-ageid-user-verification-system-myles-jackman-pandora-blake).
And the end result of all of this was 1) isp's providing user filters 2) no porn ban 3) no porn linence, so all the things that were claimed and are a popular thing to shout at brits online and the thing you first objected to me saying was wrong.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/cr2m5c/london_is_the_6th_most_surveilled_city_in_the/ex3b9wc/,arran-reddit,1565982895

400,"&gt;Conservatism on the other hand has no such vision for a societal future, because at its core, this ideology is about ""preserving things as they are"".

Yes and ""preserving things as they are"" also include cultural heritage, traditions, values, religion etc. not simply the preservation of power as you seem to imply. The CCP can't be conservative when the values it represents are in complete opposition with traditional Chinese values, ideas and beliefs.  It doesn't make the CCP conservative just because it resorts to extremely authoritarian measures to protect its rule.

&gt;The thing which you are apparently not to happy about is that the CDU is not a radical conservative or reactionary party.

What do you mean by ""radical"" conservative? The things that I criticized the CDU for are based on standard conservative values. For example, reinforcing national sovereignty by rejecting eurointegration, preserving German culture by rejecting mass migration and multiculturalism, promoting family values by rejecting gay marriage etc. None of these are radical or reactionary by any means, they are the basic principles of conservatism that the CDU abandoned out of greed and self-hatred.

478,"Somebody asked me in another thread whether I believe violence could return to NI so I’ll leave this copy and paste here.

I’m Irish and old enough to remember the Troubles. The answer to your question is complicated and without certainty. To understand the risks better and to contextualize the current situation, I would advise watching Peter Taylor’s recent documentary on BBC2.

Firstly, it’s useful to ask what actually sparked the violence. When the British Army were deployed in the early 70’s in NI, their remit was to act as a barrier between increasingly hostile sectarian communities. When Bloody Sunday resulted in the deaths of 13 Catholics shot dead by the Paras, it was the single biggest recruiting coup and PR coup for the IRA. The violence increased exponentially, fueled by economic deprivation and unemployment. The early 90’s saw both the IRA, UDA and the British Government realizing no one could win militarily, and populations in both communities tired of the cycle, with a generation of men and women lost to the violence, either dead or in prison. The peace process started slowly but surely, eventually leading to the GFA.

A lot of focus has been on the border issue and customs installations, but the GFA is about much more than this, it’s about communities integrating and business and economic co-operation, it’s about trying to get FDI back to NI and giving the impression of stability. Now that Brexit threatens all of this, and threatens to significantly worsen economic circumstances in NI, the question of violence returning is being raised. And it’s being raised now because of a few additional reasons. There has been a slow and steady increase in sectarian tensions that never went away, a generation of youth who are now willing to pick up a brick or stone and hurl it at the police and opposing community, a generation young enough not to remember the pain of the Troubles. The darker elements like the dissident IRA and their political wing Saorise are rubbing their hands with glee at the prospect of a hard border as way to recruit, as are the DUP who never wanted the GFA. And so not just real bonfires are being constructed now, figurative ones are as well, and all that’s missing is a spark.",,/r/europe/comments/cqow29/21_years_ago_today_an_ira_bomb_in_the_red_car/ex2u5l9/,Propofolkills,1565975351

Their goal was to get a united ireland with force when the majority of NI wanted to stay in the UK. They were doing something against the majority of a country's wishes. They obviously killed innocent protestant civilians and bombed areas in england and NI which were despicable acts of terrorism. 

The Old IRA were fighting under a different context, the majority of the three southern provinces were in support of the IRA. The island of ireland has had many atrocities caused by the british empire, people had enough and the british empire weren't going to let ireland get independence through a simple referendum.

Like I said The troubles is different, people (primarly foreigners) act as if NI is part of the UK because of some oppressive law which is completely wrong.

521,"&gt;A liberal can be a conservative. A socialist can be a conservative. A communist can be a conservative. A libertarian can be a conservative.

You're mixing up the word conservative as adjective with conservatism as ideology. Just because someone advocates for the status quo doesn't mean that he/she is a conservative unless the status quo is a conservative regime which definitely isn't the case with Germany atm. Merkel could be more accurately described as a neoliberal or as a technocrat but conservative no, not since she is in power at least. 

&gt;The reason we in the West identify conservatism with liberal ideals is because conservatism adapts to each respective culture and our culture is liberal.

That highly depends on the country. There are very significant differences between the conservative movements of individual western European countries. In some cases like Britain or the Netherlands yes, even the conservatives share the basic liberal principles but in countries like Spain, Germany or Italy it isn't.

&gt;The Chinese Communist Party is a very conservative political entity.

It really isn't though. The CCP couldn't give a rat's ass about preserving Chinese culture or traditions. Religious beliefs are actively discouraged by the state, in same cases they are even repressed while cultural heritage sights are bulldozed down to make way for more skyscrapers and apartment blocks. Not only that, the Communists waged 2 civil wars against the Kuomintang who were the actual conservatives.

 &gt;The CDU is a conservative political entity too.

It used to be but it's definitely not anymore. You can't call yourself a conservative and be in favor of mass migration, gay marriage, more eurointegration and the complete marginalization of Christianity (to the point where churhces are being destroyed in Germany to make way for new buildings - https://www.thelocal.de/20180110/historic-church-demolished-to-make-way-for-brown-coal-mine-).",Serbia,/r/europe/comments/cr57ee/reurope_survey_results_opinion_on_european_leaders/ex2vhse/,Petique,1565975973

Human traffickers in North Africa cram people into small boats, which are towed out into the Mediterranean and deliberately scuttled, then notify ships operated by far-left European activists to come ""rescue"" them and dump them on the shores of Europe. EU leaders have done nothing to discourage this practice, and in fact have encouraged countries to accept the ships. Thousands, if not millions, of people have entered Europe through such methods over the last decade, despite its ""extremely well secured"" border.

Spain is multiracial, many Latin-Americans come to Spain and get the citizenship for Spanish ancestors.

-

People in the north of Spain is whiter than the south, because of the sun. Spaniards share much of their DNA with Italy, Portgal, France and Germany.

Obviously we arent as white as nords, its a matter of adaptability to the enviroment.

But hey, your school partner is a Spaniard and he looks Latino, so every Spaniards should be like him.

The Northwest Ordinance (Article V) provided for the admission of several new states from within its bounds:

There shall be formed in the said territory, not less than three nor more than five States [...] And, whenever any of the said States shall have sixty thousand free inhabitants therein, such State shall be admitted, by its delegates, into the Congress of the United States, on an equal footing with the original States in all respects whatever, and shall be at liberty to form a permanent constitution and State government: Provided, the constitution and government so to be formed, shall be republican, and in conformity to the principles contained in these articles; and, so far as it can be consistent with the general interest of the confederacy, such admission shall be allowed at an earlier period, and when there may be a less number of free inhabitants in the State than sixty thousand.[7]

Considered one of the most important legislative acts of the Confederation Congress,[8] it established the precedent by which the Federal government would be sovereign and expand westward with the admission of new states, rather than with the expansion of existing states and their established sovereignty under the Articles of Confederation.

So I was wrong. It was a legislative act made during the years of the Articles of Confederation, our first constitution, and not in our real constitution.

746,"https://www.nytimes.com/2001/02/01/world/tokyo-journal-the-japanese-it-seems-are-outgrowing-japan.html

&gt; In 50 years, according to statistics kept by the Ministry of Education, the average height of Japanese 11-year-olds has increased by more than 5 1/2 inches. The height of girls, who grow faster at that age, meanwhile, has increased even more.
&gt;
&gt; So far, there has been no definitive explanation for the increased growth, but it is widely believed to be caused by improvements in diet and the elimination of once-common infectious diseases, both expressions of Japan's swift postwar economic rise. According to one recent study, for instance, intake of animal protein has doubled to 60 grams a day since 1960.
&gt;
&gt; The ultimate implication of these statistics -- much taller Japanese people -- is borne out in the experience of Mr. Kawana and many other young people seen these days on the streets of Tokyo. It is also corroborated by a variety of government and private studies that not only show Japanese people to be growing much larger than before, but also indicate changes in people's conceptions of beauty and ideal body type.
&gt;
&gt; ''In the past 20 to 30 years, the average height has increased by 5 centimeters, based on the much faster growth of people born between 1940 and 1960,'' said Makiko Kouchi, an anthropologist who is research group leader at the National Institute of Bioscience and Human Technology. ''The body weight of men has stayed the same as the height, meaning that physiques of men have remained pretty much the same. Women's body weights have not increased in pace with their heights, though, with the result that women have become much, much slimmer.''
&gt;
&gt; The vogue for thinness among Japanese women has clearly caught on, as even a quick glance at the twiggy women who appear on popular television variety shows will attest. But taller young people here complain that the Japanese idea of themselves as a short people has not kept pace with reality, resulting in a frequently inconvenient mismatch.
&gt;
&gt; ''The old Japanese industrial standards no longer fit Japanese life,'' said Matsutaro Yoshioka, research and development director of the Research Institute of Human Engineering for Quality Life, a quasi-governmental group that sells data about the characteristics of consumers to industry. ''The standard cooking table, for example, only fits the older generations. We are trying to measure the younger generation so as to advise Japanese corporations how to meet their needs.''
&gt;
&gt; The most obvious area where this mismatch is encountered is in clothing. Japan's clothing manufacturers still tend to offer few goods to those on the taller end of the scale. The problem goes well beyond clothes, though, and extends to furniture, automobile design and train seats, too. (A disclosure: at 6-foot-4, this reporter is familiar with the issue.)

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5811819/

&gt; The Japanese have traditionally been much shorter in height than their European counterparts, particularly Scandinavians, though they have experienced a dramatic secular increase in height since World War II (Matsumoto, 1982). Tanner, Hayashi, Preece, and Cameron (1982) showed this to be due primarily to an increase in leg length, possibly arising from the shift from rice to a dairy‐based diet during the 1970s.
&gt;
&gt;South Korea is another East Asian country whose inhabitants are materially shorter than in the West—indeed in 1978 South Korean children were shorter even than the Japanese (Y. S. Kim, 1982). However they, like the Japanese, have experienced a steep increase in height in recent decades, and they are now taller than the Japanese (J. Y. Kim et al., 2008; Mori, 2017). Furthermore, South Koreans are among the tallest peoples in the Asian continent (Schwekendiek &amp; Jun, 2010), and South Korean women are 20 cm taller now than they were a century ago, a larger increase over the period than any other group (NCD Risk Factor Collaboration, 2016).

-

&gt;As noted at the outset, Europeans have historically been much taller than Asians. The Dutch are recognized as the tallest nation, and their secular increase in height has recently stopped (Schönbeck et al., 2013). Figure ​Figure33 of Schönbeck et al. (2013) shows how height in The Netherlands has increased since 1955, equivalent to Figure ​Figure44 of the current article. The adult increment amounted to 7 cm in both sexes, but the pattern by age was quite different from Figure ​Figure4.4. The increment increased linearly from birth to 15 years in boys and 11 years in girls, when the increments were respectively 10 and 8 cm, after which they fell back to 7 cm at age 20; so there was no infant increment at all. However, the Dutch in 1955 were already taller (175 and 164 cm by sex) than the South Koreans were in 2005 (Schönbeck et al., 2013), so both the nature of the secular trend and the factors driving it were clearly different in the two countries.

-

&gt;In conclusion, child height and weight have increased dramatically over the past 40–60 years in Japan and South Korea. The changes have affected both size (i.e., cm and kg) and developmental age, in that the growth period has advanced in timing and shrunk in duration. Most of the height increment seen in adults has already accrued by age 1.5 years, indicating that the secular height trend in these countries (though not in The Netherlands) represents increased growth in the long bones during infancy. The trends have been larger in South Korea than Japan, but there are no convincing differences in national income, diet or lifestyle to explain them.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/cqpdj8/girls_in_traditional_dress_volendam_the/ex22r8u/,vokegaf,1565961572

The thing is, Lithuania is facing the same main issues as other developed Western countries — unsustainably low birth rates. But along with that, there also the added pressure from emigration, which is putting us at the bottom of population growth stats and masking the even more significant birth rate issues in countries like Greece, Italy, and Spain. 

Emigration was a huge issue over the last 10-15 years, but seems to be getting under control. In fact, this map is incorrect (the source itself has inaccurate nunbers) and between 2018 and 2019, our population decreased around 0.5%. This year, from January until now, our population has decresed by 787 (around 0.03%) and there's been positive growth since march until August (an increase of around 3000 or so). A lot of that is down to Ukrainian migrants, sure, but population in the UK and other Western European countries is also growing to immigration, not births. So, yes, we're not doing great but A) this map is incorrect, B) our birth rates are bad but not the worst in Europe by a long short and C) recent population growth might be pointing to a recovery.",Lithuania,/r/europe/comments/cquvma/population_growth_of_european_countries_2019/ex1rlxj/,AndriusG,1565954102

&gt;Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK which, after Brexit, will share a land border with the EU, and thus free movement rights are of particular importance. Any undermining of the operation of the CTA challenges a principal objective of the GFA,

Could you explain exactly who is threatening to end the CTA as a result of brexit? I haven't seen that anywhere at all. It would be news to me.

&gt;Equality law is of considerable constitutional importance in Northern Ireland, given the extent of discrimination that dogged its history. Indeed, human rights protections generally have a particular salience in the politics of Northern Ireland, given the history of terrorism and state responses to it. Such measures offered reassurance that Northern Ireland was embarking on a programme of real change.

Said a lot without saying much.

Which part of equality law is directly under EU oversight within the GFA, as in the GFA references the ECJ as the arbiter and administrator of said law, or makes it so that EU law must be applied as the basis of the equality law of the territory?

&gt;Leaving the EU would also impact on the remedies available for the enforcement of rights in Northern Ireland, in particular the extent to which human rights obligations limit Parliamentary sovereignty, an important part of the political settlement.

Is this part of the GFA? I have read it and not seen this in the text. 

Parliament is always sovereign. It is never limited by any decision made in the EU, so I am told by remainers.

Many later passage tombs were constructed at the tops of hills or mountains, indicating that their builders intended them to be seen from a great distance.

Regarding students, Greenlands students, university or any other than primary for that matter, can study for free in Danish universities and other educational institutions with no transfer of money from the Greenland government. This would also require renegotiation.

The PIRA’s terrorism only served to set back the cause of civil rights in Ireland by decades (because no government can be seen to give in to terrorists).

1015,"With all due respect, in your comment there is a number of misconceptions.

The Nordic Paradox don’t make assumptions, this is because the fact that it is a paradox shows that the assumptions of an hypothesis are proved wrong. Said other hypothesis is social constructionism. 

Your comment seems to focus on Nordic countries. The so called Nordic paradox is proved even if we don’t consider Nordic countries, it is something that can be seen in all countries, not just the Nordic ones, as a comparison between more feminist countries and less feminist ones., wether you include Nordic ones or not. 

In your comment you seem to assume that the fact that stereotypes exists implies that the causality is as follows: Stereotypes create differences in behavior. You don’t consider the possibility that differences in behavior causes stereotypes. Because the differences are smaller in less feminist countries than in more feminist countries, (wether you include the Nordic countries or not). A few comments to help clarify the implications:

1.- The Nordic paradox shows that differences in average personality between men and women are stronger in feminist countries. The same with career choices and many other variables.

2.- Social constructionism assumes that said differences are the result of social pressure (in the form of stereotypes), of this is true, you would expect said differences to diminish in countries with less stereotypes and increase in countries with more stereotypes.

3.-  Given that the results are the exact opposite than what you would expect of said hypothesis were true, there are two possibilities. Either feminism increases traditional gender roles and stereotypes (which would be absurd, and I don’t think that you are arguing for feminism to be considered a negative force for society), or in countries with less social pressure people behave more freely showing the innate differences between tastes and interests between sexes. 

This is not to say that stereotypes are a good thing. A stereotype can be wrong or right, in the sense that said stereotype conforms with the average behavior of said group, but even when is right in that sense, it is still wrong to assume anything from any given individual based on it as what is true on average for a group there is a extraordinarily big chance to be false for a given individual, this is because the differences between the averages of two groups are always much much smaller than the variance inside a group.

This is not to say that social pressure don’t change average behavior. We know it does because different cultures show differences in the gender roles. What it means is that not all those differences of behavior are explained by social pressure/stereotypes/culture, as if that would be the case there would be no reason for all cultures through history to share many things in common in regards with gender roles. I.e.: there is no culture in which mothers systematically kill every single baby girl at birth. It’s an extreme example I know, but it goes to highlight that not all influence in behavior is due to culture/social pressure, but due to biological influence.

So the fact that stereotypes exist in Nordic countries and in countries very influenced by feminism is expected in the field of psychology/sociology, the paradox don’t claim that those stereotypes don’t exist in feminist countries, it showcases that the believe that  the existence of said stereotypes proves that the differences in behavior are a signal of discrimination is actually false.",,/r/europe/comments/cqpm0l/more_uk_girls_take_science_alevels_than_boys_for/ex1d52y/,ignigenaquintus,1565939942

&gt;witch trials

&gt;In the county of Vaduz and in the dominion of Schellenberg witch persecutions took place at the end of the 16th and in the middle of the 17th century. The climax lay in the years from 1648 to 1651: At that time about 100 persons were executed. After that there were witch trials again, in the wake of which at least nine people were burned as witches and sorcerers. Further trials took place in the 1660s and 1675/76. For the last phase of the witch persecutions around 1679/80 alone, more revealing sources are available. The Vaduz witch trials came to an end in 1681, when the emperor prohibited Count Ferdinand Karl von Hohenems from continuing the inquisitions and trials. In 1684 the emperor withdrew the criminal jurisdiction from the count because he had enriched himself with the assets of the convicts. Ferdinand Karl von Hohenems was arrested, accused, sentenced and banished to Kaufbeuren in Swabia.

Meanwhile many on the other side are not persecuted anymore because you want to keep the peace and not stir things up again. Would be best to just forget about it then and not persecute the soldiers as well.

&gt;The school in the south-eastern city of Diyarbakir was **one of five** primary schools since 2013 that offered a fully Kurdish-language education.   
&gt;  
&gt;From 2014 onwards, it was also the first school in Turkey to give parents their children's report cards in the Kurdish language.  
But that has now come to an end after it became the first Kurdish school to be closed down in October by the governor. **All five such schools in the south-east have now been shut.**

1183,"&gt;They would then need to decide if they wanted to become a state, like Puerto Rico did just before trump won.  
&gt;  
&gt;THEN the Senate would decide if we were gonna incorporate it

No.  Here's what the constitution says about new states ([Article 4, Section 3](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleiv)):

&gt;**New states may be admitted by the Congress into this union**; but no new states shall be formed or erected within the jurisdiction of any other state; nor any state be formed by the junction of two or more states, or parts of states, without the consent of the legislatures of the states concerned as well as of the Congress.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Congress shall have power to dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to the United States; and nothing in this Constitution shall be so construed as to prejudice any claims of the United States, or of any particular state.

Congress is the house and the senate and when Hawaii became a state a bill was introduced (Hawaii Admission Act) which was submitted and approved in both houses and signed by the president.  Also and just for clarification: there's nothing in the constitution that says that a territory has to vote for statehood to be admitted into the union.  Congress could pass a bill making Canada a state tomorrow if it wanted to... not like that going to happen, but the way the constitution is written it could.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/cqxgtf/us_looking_into_purchasing_the_entirety_of/ex0ylpa/,ujorge,1565925525

1240,"So, about 7 years ago I was at a bar in Boston and casually asked the bartender for some ""Irish Carbombs"" (drink) for myself and some friends. He flat out told me ""No. Not by that name, I won't serve it to you."" Confused and taken back at the blunt response, as this is a commonly ordered drink, I figured the bartender was just being a dick for some reason. Trying to circumvent his logic, I said ""Ok, can I order a Guinness then and a shot of Irish whisky?"" -  ""No. Not now you can't."" He responded. ""I'm sorry is there a reason why you can't serve that drink?"" I asked. The bartender then stopped and gave his full attention. ""I'm Irish."" He said. ""My family and I grew up in Ireland during the time of the IRA, when people were terrified going about their day to day lives in the streets, because cars exploding the streets. I was there when one went off. That's like going into a bar and ordering a 9/11. Would you order a 9/11?"" 

In my entire life, it had never dawned on me, or had I stopped to contemplate the origin of the name. I don't think many people do, it's still a pretty commonly ordered drink by that name. He was absolutely correct...  I immediately understood where he was coming from and it was probably one of the most profound things I've had an instant realization of in a bar.

1318,"As part the self-rule law of 2009, the Greenland and its people have the right to self-determination. That includes the right to declare full independence from Denmark, although the law specifically states that it would have to approved by a referendum among the Greenlandic people. The self-rule law doesn't say anything about becoming part of another country, but I guess it would involve first fully separating from Denmark and then pursuing their transfer to the other country.

Much as I think this idea is entertaining, I have my serious reservations about its reality:

1) Money. Denmark transfers large sums to Greenland as part of the so-called block grant, which in theory is 3.4 billion DKK (c. 0.45 billion Euros) per year, but in reality the number is about a billion higher (as noted in a review by the Danish finance minister in 2017). Quite a sum for a place with a bit more than 50K people. Additionally, although Greenland has health clinics, two hospitals and a university, they are rather limited due to the small population. This means that more complicated medical cases are transferred to Denmark and many Greenlandic students attend universities in Denmark. For free, payed by taxes by people in Denmark (taxes in Greenland stay with Greenland's home rule, i.e. there is no money transfer to Denmark). Then there's the odd one-time payments. Greenland's government wanted a new airport and ""somehow"" (more on that in #3) the Danish state ended up providing funding and state-guaranteed loans, which is so large compared to Greenland's economy that many say Denmark will end up having to foot the bill. In theory the block grant is supposed to become smaller when Greenland starts earning money from their minerals and other natural resources. This all looked mighty fine one or two decades ago, but as surveys have continued, the economic feasibility of most projects has disappeared. Getting to the minerals is very expensive. Global warming and disappearing ice might change that, but that's a bit of a gamble. So, at this point Greenland is a money pit. However, I've never heard anyone in Denmark complain about this; they are, after all, Greenlanders but also Danish citizens.

2) What's in it for Greenland? Even before the self-rule law of 2009, they decided many things themselves. With the self-rule law, they govern most things, with major exceptions being defense and foreign policy. Since they govern their own trade policy, parts of the foreign policy is defacto transferred to Greenland too. Would they get similar levels of self-governance if part of the US? Would the US send a block grant to Greenland every year? Would healthcare and education remain free? I doubt it.

3) What's in it for USA? Trump may have his ideas, but something like this would take years and require the work of many levels of government. The US armed forces already have essentially unrestricted access via the Thule Air Base and Denmark is a close ally. This leads me back to the airport mentioned in #1. Greenland's government wanted a new civilian airport and expansions of two older civilian airports. Most people with any sort of insight into economy and levels of air traffic said this made little sense. Step in China. They were willing to provide funding and all the other things needed in this fundamental piece of infrastructure. Denmark wasn't too happy. The US *really* wasn't too happy about having a Chinese-funded and -run airport right next door. They contacted Denmark and shortly after Denmark made a deal where most of the funding relies on them.",,/r/europe/comments/cqxgtf/us_looking_into_purchasing_the_entirety_of/ex0ql1e/,iieer,1565919780

 Candidate Trump pointed out in 2015 that it was a bad deal and would either be renegotiated or he would leave. The Iranians repeatedly refused offers to negotiate so Trump left which was his right since congress had never ratified it.

 After Trump left, Iran agreed to follow it regardless of what Trump did. Iran has violated it so now all other signers are obligated to reinstate their sanctions on Iran.

1653,"&gt; Oh I'm not saying reckless democratic crusading is productive, just that democracy needs to be supported. Without foreign support, Eastern Europe may not have transitioned as it did. Of course, The West had won a cultural war by that point and Eastern Europeans wanted liberal democracy. 

Yeah obviously I would want to support countries who are themselves moving towards democray, but this is something totally different than thinking ""gee, lemme sanction China and woosh they will become a democray"".

Sandctions just don't work very well. North Korea has been sanctions for decades, and it's still a dictatorship.

&gt;and in some cases the communist party itself initiated a transition, because the Soviet Union collapsed.

That's exactly the emulation I mentioned. Our model of society is so good, they themselves initiated a transition. We just need to sit and applause! This is what works IMO.

&gt;In addition to domestic and foreign pressure, their oppressive systems had been imposed by a foreign power 

Not in the case of Russia itself?

In the case of Russia, our mistake was that we didn't help them enough in the period that they were open to democracy.

I think we are doing it opposite - we are sanctioning hard dictatorships, then when they transision to democracy and need help, we sometimes drop the ball and they revert to authoritarianism.

Instead we should rely on the emulation effect, and then go all-in on helping democrati forces to stabilize control when they have taken over power.",Denmark,/r/europe/comments/cqr3w2/do_you_think_the_eu_should_sanction_the_prc_why/ewzkc07/,Orange-of-Cthulhu,1565896955

In my protestant state school we did a lot of Irish history, but I can't remember how far we went past the Irish Free State's creation.

My upbringing had already determined my attitude to the Troubles though. As far as I was concerned, Northern Ireland being part of the UK was *just right* and the way things were. The IRA were just terrorist thugs who wrongly felt justified using violence to attempt to achieve political objectives.

As an adult, I read up on the history a lot and realise it's a lot more nuanced. Republicans would see Northern Ireland as a minority of Irish performing a coup and creating their own mini-state (with the help of the British Empire), complete with a de facto one party regime and systematic discrimination.

Wow you're a specimen. Corruption has a **huge** impact on the living standards of a country, which in turn impacts education, work and birth rates. You can't decouple them.

The fact that you actually genuinely are not aware of the impact of corruption is just astonishing.

&gt;You are talking about the clan ownership system which indeed was a part of european history.

The word you're looking for is *corruption,* which is a part of European history that many European countries have dealt with far more than Bulgaria has.

&gt;There are literal ghettos in the capital where if you are white everybody is looking at you as if you are a demon

Yeah, and a Roma trying to be perfectly legit, seeking work or education in a white district is just warmly welcomed, huh?

&gt;I never said anything about ""purging"" or doing anything to the brown people and i would appreciate it if you steer away from personal attacks in the future as i came to discuss and not to measure who can pull the best strawman or ad hominem.

With the language you used in your now *deleted comment* you have absolutely no right to lecture anyone about politeness.

&gt;The political structure in Bulgaria immitates the english political structure. You either vote for the party that sucks less or you vote for the crazies.

This means literally nothing. All you're saying is ""first past the post"", which is not the fault of immigrants, and on the contrary makes it much harder for immigrants to have a proper voice in politics, which leads to sentiments of social and political exclusion.

&gt;I dunno where you imagined those 0.7% but by official statistics only 85% of the population is a Bulgarian native the remaining 15% are what costs the government well over 8million eur or levs a year.

Well, Hinkley point in the UK is getting paid about £100 per MWH. Offshore wind farms in the UK contracted in the last 5 years are getting paid between £65 and £170 per MWH.

But the big problem with renewables is the variable output. Last month in the UK:

Wind

Minimum 0.27 GW

Solar

The great irony is Australia and Greece want to keep the use of the word feta for the same reasons: feta ultimately represents cultural heritage.

&gt;(b) on board any aircraft or any vessel under the jurisdiction of a Member State;

&gt;(c) to any person inside or outside the territory of the Union who is a national of a Member State;

&gt;(d) to any legal person, entity or body which is incorporated or constituted under the law of a Member State;

&gt;(e) to any legal person, entity or body in respect of any business done in whole or in part within the Union.

&gt;https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32012R0036

As you see nothing about territorial waters, because as discussed later, it would be illigal due to ""Innocent Passage"", foreign ships in territorial waters are not under jurisdiction of the state.



Ships can traverse territorial waters of other states due to UN law of the seas. EU sanctions do not and can not overwrite the right of innocent passage.

And no, Iranian vessel did not enter Gibraltar port. 

&gt;https://tankertrackers.com/storage/1352/responsive-images/Screenshot-2019-07-04-10.47.11___detail_1024_576.png


Stopping or even anchoring do not automatically negate innocent passage.
&gt;Passage shall be continuous and expeditious. However, passage includes stopping and anchoring, but only in so far as the same are incidental to ordinary navigation or are rendered necessary by force majeure or distress or for the purpose of rendering assistance to persons, ships or aircraft in danger or distress.

 Moreover the decision to cease the ship was made a day before it even entered Gibraltar waters.

1944,"&gt;Well, Hinkley point in the UK is getting paid about £100 per MWH. Offshore wind farms in the UK contracted in the last 5 years are getting paid between £65 and £170 per MWH.

Hinkley Point can only deliver at this price because they are heavily subsidised and not liable for damages or demolition. The state bears those costs.

&gt;But the big problem with renewables is the variable output.

With a big enough grid with wind and solar being dispersed around the country this is less of an issue. Additionally pumped storage and gas power plants can help to mitigate any spike or dips.

&gt;Currently the variability of wind and solar is balanced in countries like the UK and Germany with the use of fossil fuels. For all the talk of storage, anything more than a few hours worth is still prohibitively expensive and governments and industry are planning on using fossil fuel backup for decades to come.

We already have one of the cheapest ways to store energy, pumped storage. In most regions in europe this can be achieved. with smaller and bigger dammed lakes, natural or artificial.

Nuclear Power is the exact opposite of renewables and is extremely static. The power output is very slow to change and is a massive disincentive to actually transition to solar and wind.",Österreich,/r/europe/comments/cqnung/europe_has_space_for_enough_wind_turbines_to/ewy5fwm/,RedKrypton,1565875113

1952,"&gt;the big problem with renewables is the variable output

It's the waste. The size of solar farm you would need to match the output of one nuclear power station is going to create so much more waste.

&gt;Solar panel waste will become a major issue in the coming decades as old solar panels reach the ends of their useful lifespans and require disposal. Last November, Japan’s Environment Ministry issued a warning that the amount of solar panel waste Japan produces each year is likely to increase from 10,000 to 800,000 tons by 2040, and the country has no plan for safely disposing of it.

&gt;In China, there could be 20 million metric tons of solar panel waste, or 2,000 times the weight of the Eiffel Tower, by 2050

2017,"I agree that without a common enemy, US and EU interests will continue to diverge, but I doubt that there would be any differences significant enough to seriously harm the alliance between Europe and the US.  I think it would be a good thing if Europe was able to provide a sort of counter-balance to US ambitions abroad.  Perhaps fiascos like the Iraq war could have been prevented.  

I dont think the EU will become an institution diametrically opposed to US interests either.  I get the feeling that you think the US is an imperialistic power which is inferior to Europe with its nations of high minded ideals.  I think you will be in for a surprise if Europe develops their own army and is capable of taking actions which might be viewed as imperialistic. France, the strongest military in Europe, already engaged in ""imperialistic"" activities recently.  There was the bombing in Libya, their activities in Northern Africa in general, and a few other things which display their willingness to engage in such activity.  It is easy to criticize the actions of a nation active around the world if your country does not even have the capability to do the same thing, all while having much less expected of them.  It is like sitting on the sidelines and yelling at the star player how they are doing everything wrong.  

Having said all that, the US has made many terrible mistakes over the last few decades.  The US needs to accept less active roles abroad and let other nations increase their regional presence.  The EU could form an army if they truly had the political will to do so, even though it would take a while.  It really needs to, because the US is quickly finding its population is not happy with the status quo and the money spent on pointless excursions.

2023,"The problem is actually representative of a more fundamental problem. Australia isn't the only one doing it.

The approach the EU takes is based on the concept of French 'terroir', meaning to a specific agriproduct is always tied to an area with a specific breed of stock or plant.
It basically copyrights the land in that geographic area and thus guaranteeing exclusive rights to the region and their jobs forever.

The Australian (and for that matter the US and Canadian and co.) approach is treating agriproducts just like any other IP: If you have that specific stock and the process, it is just the same as the original. The reason why they do it is it allows for a more free market-based approach and it also allows European offshoot countries like the US, Australia and co. to produce otherwise copyrighted products they heavily rely on in their daily lives. If not, they would be completely dependent on importing European products for a lot of their food.

Everytime the EU does FTAs with countries like that, it tries to make the other side have the 'terroir' principle enshrined. Since the EU usually has a lot of leverage over say Africa or Latin America in terms of agrifood production, it usually gets its way but for the US and Australia and Canada, it usually doesn't work so easily because they do bot want to conform and have leverage in other areas such as financial services.

2058,"&gt;You're proving my point. If it matters so much, then there's no need for anything beyond a ""made in"" label.

Local produce will be more common and may well be the only exposure of local customers to a product of that name. As such they may think that the local variety is the only variety, even if it is of lesser quality. That means a lost opportunity for the original producer to sell their superior product.

By forcing both producers to offer their product under a different name, we have the best of both worlds: customers are aware of both the original and the copy, and can make a choice based on their ownt taste and priorities. That also means that the copy may very well develop its own following. At that point it will also be entitled to the same protection.

2075,"&gt;the key point is that the benefits of EU membership outweigh the occasional drawbacks by far.

And my point would be that that very much depends on what you see as beneficial and what you see as a cost.The weighing up of EU membership as positive or negative is pretty much entirely subjective.

&gt;It may be sold under the same name, but it not necessarily the same, after all China built their economy on for a significant part on plagiarism with dubious quality. Steel is an alloy, so yes, there can be wide variations in composition and properties, wich means different grades of quality.

Yes.. And when you are buying steel in large quantities for manufacturing or construction, you tend to be pretty specific about what you need, you tend to verify and you tend to only go with suppliers that don't try to screw you by shipping something other than what was ordered..  The standards for grading steel are fairly well understood after all.

&gt;Depends on the circumstances, the point is I don't see much the UK has to offer that would incentivise to give the UK a good deal right now. It pretty obvious the UK will be compelled to make some unpleaseant concession for quick deals, after all you have to present Brexit as a hugh success.

A large developed domestic market with tendency toward net imports? And I don't think that it is obvious that the UK will be compelled to do anything, rapid trade deals aren't going to mitigate the impact of leaving the EU rapidly, so why accept deals that  aren't beneficial, or create an unpleasant or politically problematic situation?

&gt;Debatable. That may have been unequivocally true in the past, but nowadays? Maybe not so much, we'll see about that. If it's desirable to keep a close relationship depends on the attitude and behaviour of the UK. If it keeps going down that path of ever increasing hostility in rhetorics and actions towards to EU, keeping a distance might be the better option.

That's up to the EU, but the UK is going to remain a large, non-EU economy geographically close to the EU with significant bilateral trade either way. In other areas, the EU and UK share quite a few common interests. It'd be a massive pain in the arse for the EU if it ends up in a position where it has managed to alienate all of its neighbours after all.

&gt;After a no-deal Brexit the UK will immediately find itself in a rather desparate situation. The Brexiteer have made it clear that they intend to go all-in on a quick deal with the US to mitigate this.

A quick deal with the US doesn't mitigate it, no UK/US deal will be particularly quick and for any deal to mitigate anything it has to be beneficial...

Explain human trafficking then.

&gt;It does. ""A camp where persons are confined, usually without hearings and typically under harsh conditions, often as a result of their membership in a group which the government has identified as dangerous or undesirable""

People detained in ICE facilities are not being held without hearings, that's the whole point.  

&gt; The same thing happened with Japanese people and those were also concentration camps:

No, it's not ""the same thing"".  *American citizens* of Japanese descent were taken from their homes and held without trial. They'd done nothing wrong and did not deserve the treatment they got and it is a very dark stain on my country's history.  

But that is not the same thing as temporarily holding people who willfully violated our laws for processing through the immigration court system.  It's a night and fucking day difference.  Every jail in the world is a concentration camp using this logic, which would render the term meaningless.

&gt;That is your assumption. You are associating it only with Nazis and therefore everyone else must, too.

Am I? Why was there discussion of the opinions of 'holocaust scholars' on whether these facilities are concentration camps if there's wasn't an intent to associate them with the Nazis?  Stop playing dumb, we all know why.

&gt;Why bring up crimes? Because you associate these immigrants with crime?

[It is a crime](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1325) for non-citizens to cross our border without permission.  

Either you are arguing in bad faith or you are exceedingly naive (or stupid).

&gt;What is dishonest is you suddenly talking about how these people are not trustworthy instead of talking about how they are treated.

It's people like you that I'm calling dishonest.  We seem to be bumping up against the limits of your ability to follow this conversation.

&gt;The length of stay is not the major part of what makes a concentration camps.

It is certainly an element of it. People are held in concentration camps for long periods of time. Japanese internment lasted 4 years.  Boer war concentration camps ran for 2 years.  Nazi camps speak for themselves.  Meanwhile, most detainees in border patrol custody are not held there for very long.

&gt;Also, people are staying for months on average in certain facilities.

Without context that's meaningless.  The standard is to try not to hold people for longer than 72 hours, but if someone is being held for months, there just might be a valid reason to hold them.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/cq9trx/no_chance_of_usuk_deal_if_northern_ireland_peace/ewxko3g/,Shmorrior,1565860762

Trade still isn’t comparable to fighting alongside the nazis.

Creating a new Republic of the Union for an ethnic group that neither was large in absolute terms, nor constituted anything close to a majority in its territory, nor had been a separate independent nation prior to its incorporation into the USSR, was unprecedented in the history of the USSR. 

Very progressive of Finland to commit atrocities and kick out the current inhabitants of a city! Such a great example. I for one absolutely stand by the fact that all Czechs of the Sudetenland should be killed!

Yeah, the objective was to surround and then take the city. The city had no Karelian or finnish population, so you cannot use that as a “liberating” excuse. 🥺

2148,"&gt; Trump will be gone soon, and while relations won't be exactly the same, you will likely see the US pushing for a stronger EU with support for a European army.

I believe it when I see it. The crisis in the EU/US relationship has been brewing since 2002 when some Western European countries denied the US the backing for their illegal wars and the US promptly divided European countries. I do not see this going back to the old normal of a united west - after the fall of the USSR, the external pressure to paper over essential differences in interest is gone, and it won't come back. While Russia stronk, it is just a question of time till its decline will be very obvious. And European appetite to support US imperialism isn't too high.

&gt;when in reality it isn't happening because there is no political will for it in Europe.

And there won't  be for generations. Europe is not a single country but a somewhat loose union. Setting common rules for an unified economic framework took 30y, agreeing on a political and judicial framework for aligning laws and freedoms took &gt;50y and has stalled lately. I can't see federalization or a common army taking less than 100 - 200y.

&gt;I think Europeans like the arrangement because they are able to use their money for other things, while knowing they have the power of the US military to back them up.

Sure, that was and is true. And the USA likes it because it has unchallenged power over Europe and agrees to pay for this. Simple deal.

What I don't get is why typically US Americans are so super naive to think a strong European army would mean we will be still aligned with the US and not clash. Nothing in history indicates that this would be true, in fact, a powerful EU would most likely get into rivalries with the US the same way China does now. 

Just imagine a replay of 9/11 and the aftermath. This time, the EU doesn't just write concerned letters but tells the US is has no legal ground for invading a couple of countries and it will deploy a peacekeeping force sufficiently powerful to make it very bloody for the US to invade the next Iraq/Afghanistan. Then what?

No, I don't, wtf?

&gt; half of the West does that 

Certainly not half. And even if it was, does that legitimize it in any way? No.

&gt; most of the youths, history is full of rebellions against old elites

They are not politicians in power... come on.

&gt; in democracy elites must be changing or they are removed 

Are you aware that **ORBAN** HAS BEEN THE **ELITE** in power for the last decade? Isn't it ironic that he speaks against not specified ""elites"" and blames them for the problems his government is responsible for?

&gt; Is there rhetoric against rule of law?

Are you kidding me? Rule of law and independent judiciary is one of the pillars of democracy, and one of the fundamental values of the EU, which Hungary is part of. Do you even watch the situation in Hungary or are you just blindly defending Orban, because you believe his bullshit? Seriously, do you know anything about recent developments in Hungary? The limitations of competences of Hungarian Constitutional Court and shifts of power to the government including abolishing public interest itigations, limitations of the Constitutional Court regarding reviewing constitutionality of non-procedural changes to the Fundamental Law, changes in the procedures of appointing judges and limits to the Court's say on budgetary matters, ... The arbitrary creation of National Justice Office and the extensive powers given to its president **chosen by the government**? Just this one thing is almost a book case for breaching the principles of rule of law... I can continue all day but I don't have time for this bullshit, you should seriously actually start watching politics you are advocating.

&gt; Some may not like the direction but it has nothing to do with legality.

LOL of course it has nothing to do with legality, because it is legality that is changed. The problem is legitimacy, not legality.

&gt;Academic structures and authorities. Old elites in essence. 

LOL. I don't even have words for that.

&gt;This needs deeper discussion and knowledge. Academy has a role in asociety, are they fulfilling that role? Because they are employees of the state and when they started to bite the hand that fed them it’s no wonder changes were coming. 

Yeah it definitely seems that you have no clue on what is going on in Hungary...

&gt; Point is many old political elites you praise here 

Except I don't praise any politicians here, you just made that up out of your (stupid) assumptions. I am simply desciribing Orban's political stances and rhetoric as far-right, because that's what it is. I am not demonizing him in any way, I am merely analyzing his features as a politician.

&gt;  democracy is not only when your candidates win

What MY candidates? ... Yes, you are right, it's not when your candidates win. But democracy also means independent judiciary, academy, media, which have to be protected by the very means of democracy - civil society. And all of this has been constantly threatened and limited by the current Hungarian government, in many ways. Democracy needs to defend itself not to become a totality, and Hungary is definitely on it's way there. Democracy is not simply the rule of the majority, although in practice it often is, but democracy is much more than that.

BTW, far-right is not demonization. You got it wrong. It's a simple place in the political spectrum that is identified by an agent's rhetoric and actions.",Czechoslovakia,/r/europe/comments/cpu4lt/hungarys_farright_government_vilifies_finland/ewxl5dm/,peterstiglitz,1565861309

It makes the ICE facilities = concentration camps comparison an invalid one.  People are fine to criticize the conditions, staffing, treatment, resources, whatever else. Just stop trying to attach baggage to the issue that diminishes what people that went to *actual* concentration camps experienced. 

&gt;If they said ""I want to leave this camp"" they would have been let go? No, they wouldn't. Only if they agreed to leave the US but that is of course not the same as leaving the concentration camps.

Non-citizens do not get to simply cross into the US and do as they please.  Many of these people cross the border with the *intention* of surrendering to border patrol and being taken in for processing.  Border patrol isn't out rounding up people on the Mexican side of the border or US to stuff in these places. They came to us.

2251,"Spending is irrelevant, it's capability that matters. Germany's military is in terrible shape at the moment. France is much more capable, but its forces are geared towards interventions in Africa and are therefore rather light; the ability of the French to deploy sufficient and tough-enough forces quickly to stop a Russian invasion of, say, the Baltic states, is very doubtful.

&gt; bans Germany from having nuclear weapons

And this is why forging any kind of effective common European military will be extremely difficult. Especially its nuclear arm, because the Russians still keep a vast nuclear stockpile and are not above blackmailing other countries using the nuclear stick. A common European military would have to greatly increase its nuclear capabilities (deploying a full nuclear triad and respond tit for tat to any new Russian armament initiatives). The UK is leaving the EU and France has made it clear it won't share its nuclear arsenal. The US nuclear umbrella protects Europe against Russian nuclear blackmail for now, but what if the US withdraws its guarantees?

As regards conventional forces, we'd need an integrated command and vastly increased spending to maintain sufficient conventional forces, also deployed along the peripheries (Baltic states, Romania, Poland, Cyprus), to be able to respond quickly to any military adventurism in our backyard. This would, however, also require a CLEAR political leadership, i.e. someone would have to have the authority to deploy the forces (because even a top-notch military unit is completely useless if there's no one to send it to combat) – if all EU countries had a veto power, the EU military would be completely and utterly impotent. If it would take just one country (say a Putin's stooge in Hungary or Italy or Czechia) to block any EU military response, the whole project would be a completely useless waste of money. Presently, the US takes lead in most NATO operations and the rest follows. Without the US, I very much doubt there would be political will in Europe to even defend the peripheral states and to confront Russian adventurism.

And in case you think I am focusing too much on Russia, the same applies to any would-be trouble maker (say, Erdogan or various actors in North Africa).

2321,"&gt; Brexit hasn't happened yet, we still don't know if it will

That's a very optimistic way to look at it. However, Brexit is 2 and half months away, and your new PM is called ""the Trump of Britain"" for a reason. He has got no good will towards the EU, and they have none for him. There's red lines for each side, and unfortunately, it seems like these red lines are right on top of each in some cases, like the Irish Backstop issue. When you have neither side willing to extend an olive branch and both sides not budging on key issues, it becomes impossible to move forward. Johnson doesn't seem like one to give in, nor does the European Commission.  If Brexit is avoided, I don't think it will be done pleasantly. It will be a last minute crash.

However, pessimistic views on the inevitability of Brexit ~~and secret hopes that it becomes cataclysmic ending to not just the British Empire, but also the British state on the whole, leading to parts of it breaking off and integrating into Europe~~, I think you are right elsewhere. While Europe is by no means in a perfect position, with Germany, the heart of Europe, weening off of nuclear and coal, potentially leading to Russia getting a bigger cut of the German energy market, and Russia and Turkey are off causing trouble, just outside of the EU, it is, overall, doing well.

Hence why Hitler took the pre-emptive gamble to strike first.

To their detriment.

Their entire existence is to be against republicanism and remain in the union at all costs. Once reunification happens, their existence is pointless, there is no joining back in the union.

They are the staunches of the staunch. Their hatred runs too deep. Even their leader stated if unification happens [she'll leave the country.](https://www.irishcentral.com/news/irishvoice/united-ireland-arlene-foster). That kind of says it all. Their leader would rather leave than live in a republic. 

Most Unionists would integrate fine. [Even the Orange Order is being welcomed with open arms by Leo two days ago.](https://extra.ie/2019/08/13/news/irish-news/leo-varadkar-orange-order-march).

Other than that, we're pretty much in agreement. I think it's fair to say that 80% of it it exactly what you say: Protecting domestic producers against possible foreign competition. It's especially sensitive in agri-business, because it's what Southern Europe and France heavily depend on and there's no way Brussels can let them down. 

Personally, I wouldn't object to use ""feta"" as a generic term rather than a protected description of origin. As long as they don't call it ""original feta from Greece"" whilst it isn't made in Greece (i.e. duplicitous), I'm fine with it because the consumers will sort it out in the end.

If it's the cause, it's worth emulating in other places, if it's the result of its wealth and it's unique geographical history and a peculiar artifact then it is not worth considering.

Historically Switzerland was hardly ever been a rich country, there are no valuable natural resources, and being a landlocked country there were never any over-sea territories, which helped other countries to prosper tremendously. Switzerland was by all means considered as one of the poorest countries in Europe, and even in the 19th century many Swiss left the country to seek better opportunities. The success of Switzerland started with industrialization and the establishment of Switzerland as a direct democracy with strong federalistic structures. All those factors are considered to have been played an important role in its development.

2. You are talking about the clan ownership system which indeed was a part of european history.  

3. There are literal ghettos in the capital where if you are white everybody is looking at you as if you are a demon(Unless you have already been beaten up by the mobs). Ambulances get assaulted and people are getting robbed frequently. Unless all ""0.7%""  
 of the tan people of prosperity,education and peace are all multiplied 6 times and concentrated only in those ghettos then sure you got the image right. If you steer clear from any neighbourhood surrounding the black holes of prosperity then in this case you will have a good time at half the cost of any EU country.
4. I never said anything about ""purging"" or doing anything to the brown people and i would appreciate it if you steer away from personal attacks in the future as i came to discuss and not to measure who can pull the best strawman or ad hominem.  

5. The political structure in Bulgaria immitates the english political structure. You either vote for the party that sucks less or you vote for the crazies. 
6.

Let's not mention the fact that the majority of websites providing statistics say that Roma and non-native population statistics are usually underestimated and the fact that 20% (by 2017 statistics)  of bulgarian population is above the age of 65.

2642,"So how do you know they are as conscious when the areas of the brain that are hypothized to contain consciousness (and every part of the brain) is very underdeveloped? If a huge chunk of your neural connections were somehow removed you would obviously not be “you” anymore and you would have all your cognitive and all other neural functions impaired. Why would consciousness not? 

I’m on board with it creating trauma. The article you linked seemed to show that the males who were kids and could remember the procedure were likely to experience PTSD while that was not the case for males who were circumcised as infants even tho they also had increased risk of depression and anxiety and other disorders. I still read it like the older kids were much more serverely impactet. If FGM were done with very young babies it would likely have less servere effects too both mentally and physically than it is now when done to children and teens. It’s  ofc horrible no matter what. Discussing this in detail seems unimportant. Regardless, I’d still strongly claim that cutting off glans is worse than cutting off the foreskin for sexual satisfaction no matter at what age. 

&gt; i think what they do to most american boys is the male equivalent of the worst type of FGM.

It’s not about what you think. I can think that cutting a finger off is worse than cutting an arm off if I for some reason was super emotional about finger cuttings but not so much about arm cuttings. The most severe form of FGM is way way more invasive both initially and permanently. That’s obvious. How can you seriously not see that when reading about it. It’s not so much about glans vs the foreskin but all the other horrible things that are done other than cutting off the clitoris (which is still the worst for women). You seem very biased in this and I don’t see why other than an irrational strong emotional reaction that happens to favor one violation over some others.",,/r/europe/comments/cpqc8z/circumcision_of_girls_in_germany_stop_this_madness/ewwbo07/,vb_nm,1565825184

Its your opinion that there is no threat to the union. There are many who think that Brexit is a big threat. A border poll has never been as likely to pass according to polls. An argument for one is the best it has every been especially if there is a hard brexit. If it would be called, if it would pass I don't know. I don't think it is a risk worth taking. 

That is before you take into account the economic damage a no deal brexit is projected to do to NI. If NI ends up poorer with more unemployment and more tension I can see the conditions for a perfect storm. Violence is already up. We don't need to risk this hard fought for peace. 

Scotland is a different story and I cant speak with great knowledge about this as I have not lived there and am not as aware of their system.

Oh que si. 

&gt;La justice le soupçonne d’avoir inventé l’escroquerie du siècle. Ces quinze dernières années, Cyril Astruc a passé sa vie entre des villas somptueuses et des cellules de prison, fréquenté des gangsters et des milliardaires, gagné jusqu’à 600.000 euros par jour grâce à des méthodes peu avouables. 

&gt;Il est comme Arsène Lupin enfermé à la Santé dans 813, le plus troublant des romans de Maurice Leblanc : un prisonnier-vedette, qui suscite autant de vigilance que d’admiration. 

&gt;On le présente comme « le prince du CO2 », le cerveau de l’escroquerie à la taxe carbone, cet incroyable tour de bonneteau qui a coûté près de 2 milliards d’euros à la France en moins d’un an, entre novembre 2008 et juin 2009, et au moins quatre fois plus à l’Union Européenne. 

&gt;Sur ses propres bénéfices, les montants les plus mirobolants circulent : la justice les chiffre à 22 millions d’euros en France et 72 millions d'euros en Belgique, mais les estimations les plus hautes vont bien au-delà.   « Il a pris au moins 500 millions », nous a certifié un de ses ennemis exilé en Israël, partagé entre la jalousie et l’admiration.

&gt;Tout partait d’une noble idée : pour réguler les émissions de gaz carbonique dans l’atmosphère, l’Europe a institué en 2005 le système dit des « droits à polluer ». Chaque entreprise dont l’activité peut avoir un effet direct sur la qualité de l’air dispose d’un quota annuel de rejet de CO2. Si elle le dépasse, elle doit acheter des certificats d’émissions supplémentaires.

&gt;Il assure ne s’être intéressé au système des « droits à polluer » que pour le mécanisme financier. 

&gt;Son idée était de créer un marché concurrent à BlueNext pour la protection des forêts. Au lieu de s’échanger des quotas de CO2, les entreprises y auraient acheté des « certificats de non-déforestation ». Il suffisait de convaincre des présidents africains de signer des engagements contre le déboisement massif, ce qui ne leur coûtait pas grand-chose ; puis de trouver des industriels européens pour financer ces opérations. 

&gt;En retour, l’argent aurait abondé un fonds de développement des infrastructures, moyennant un pourcentage pour lui – « On n’est pas des philanthropes. » Si tout s’était passé comme prévu, sa société serait entrée en Bourse dans l’année et il aurait touché « entre 500 et 600 millions d’euros au moment de l’introduction ». 

&gt;De grandes banques de la City étaient prêtes à le suivre. 

&gt;« Pourquoi les États ont-ils créé ce marché du CO2 ? Qui a eu l’idée de taxer des produits qui reposaient sur du vent ? Les banques ont profité du système [plusieurs sont mises en examen], les courtiers aussi. Tout le monde s’est sucré et il faut croire que pendant des années, personne n’a rien vu. »

2796,"Sure. I am not implying you're wrong. I'm questioning what the alternative is.

We have a very clear problem: People are pissing in the steets of Amsterdam of which the vast manority are men.

Solution: We put in portable urinals that are cheap, easy to place and have the lowest possible barrier of entry to encourage men to use them instead of pissing in the street.

Side-effect: the public toilets that are available (which are mostly unisex) are not used by men as much, lowering the barrier of entry for women.

The retort of this thread: Why don't we place an equal amount of toilets there for women as we do for men?

The answer? The problem that's trying to be solved is aimed at men as they are the ones causing the most problems. 

What did we solve with this argument? Absolutely fuck all. We've established that men will piss in the street when they have no easier alternative and we've established that portable toilets for men have been placed to try and remedy this issue.

Hurray! Another 15minutes of both of our lives is wasted in an argument that shouldn't have happened in the first place because 

1: These toilets aren't placed to give men and advantage over women.
2: These tojlets aren't placed for convenience but as a countermeasure
3: The city determined this was the easiest, cheapest and most effective method to counter the problem.

We could, alternatively, remove these urinals and put more police on the street with the sole purpose of finding people that piss in the street. (That would be less effective, more expensive but wouldn't make women feel left out i guess).

Or we could place an equal amount of portable toilets that women can also use. I don't think i have to tell you what an unguarded public toilet generally looks like right? This would give the women something to look at and feel equally treated because these things would be so disgusting that the only thing you'll ever do is look at them.

Not too mention there are GUARDED, SAFE AND CLEAN toilets right inside the damn building on the picture that's open 24/7 a mere 100 METERS from this exact spot. (Fun fact, the women toilet area inside that building is much bigger than the men area. I guess you'll never figure out why that is)

Don't worry, i don't feel personally attacked. I am only disappointed that you feel the need to bring gender inequality into a topic about ugly portable toilets that are a necessity because men piss on the fucking street. 

You are damaging the reputation of everyone fighting for gender equality by baiting for a discussion that isn't anywhere close to being relevant. Look at the reactions in this thread to all these dumb ""why are there no women toilets"" questions. Most of these people are not against equality but you're giving them nothing to support that cause the next time the topic of equality comes up.

""IF WE JUST PUT AN EQUAL NUMBER OF PORTABLE TOILETS ON THE DTREET WE'RE EQUAL AND IT'S OK RIGHT? HURR HURR RIGHT?"" 

Or should we also start the argument on why there are more sit-down toilets in the women restrooms compared to the men's restrooms? Or why there are no urinals in the women room? 

Remember #metoo? Valid fucking argument when it started. Used as a joke now because it was used for everything. ""this man commented on my new glasses at work, is he spying on me? #metoo right?""

A major news site actually runs 'Stadium Files' where they collect all their own articles related to stadium construction projects exclusively (there are plenty of arenas and venues for other sports, training facilities, etc. built also) and so far they have 205. Obviously, they can write about the same story multiple times though. 

Projects going 3-5 times over the original budget are extremely common, almost the norm. A then-2nd league team got approved for a €12 million new stadium but went bankrupt before construction began, solely because they couldn't finance the costs of the planning. They played in the lowest amateur league (6th league) but later dissolved that team as well - and the construction is underway. They look like they'll receive a bailout, too.

Properly determining how much that would be would certainly get tricky, but there's quite a difference between e.g. how much unemployed people get here in Germany (Hartz4 - which is, in the end, not much less than what someone on minimum wage has at the end of the month) and a real bare minimum.

2959,"First of all I support the system of the national social health insurance, like it is for example in Germany. The German system is oldest, founded by von Bismarck; it is not flawless but working quite well. In such system, regular preventive examinations of all people can be obligatory very easily, it is actually common situation. 

I support regular mandatory general examinations of children by a paediatrician, twice a year. There is a basic standard examination procedure (medical history = anamnesis, physical examination, basic laboratory) which includes also outside visual check of genitalia. This can be extended based on state of particular child and family medical history. Also examination by a specialist can be requested. Regular preventive examination by a female(!) paediatrician gynaecologist is very important for many reasons like evaluation body development, early identification of problems, verification, if the girl is informed about her body functions, hygiene and sexuality adequately to her age and if she understands it. The most important part of such examination is the conversation with the girl which is also the first part of examination. Actually, the most important skill of a paediatrician gynaecologist is the ability of the efficient verbal communication and ability to interpret also non-verbal part of girl's responses. She must be able to gain maximal confidence, because girls are often very shy to speak about their state and problems, fears and doubts. She must also recognize signs of a psychic trauma. It is a preventive care, not diagnostic or curative care and it should be very different from examination of adult women. If there are no symptoms or information indicating a disease or a developmental disorder, trauma or abuse a brief visual examination of external genitalia is sufficient physical examination. But it is also sufficient for discovery of damages caused by an intervention like the FGM or sexual abuse. Such examination doesn’t need to be performed using the gynaecological chair and other special equipment, which could be traumatizing.",,/r/europe/comments/cpqc8z/circumcision_of_girls_in_germany_stop_this_madness/ewvdfrt/,Jizera,1565803993

2966,"The problem is not whether you can leave the church at 16 or 18. The problem is that religious parents don't accept their child's freedom to discover what they truely believe in. 16yo understands the world well enough to decide on their beliefs and philosophical ideas. Some parents understand parental authority as the right to indoctrinate their children. ""You have to go to church, believe what we believe in and don't ask questions. And we do it for your own good because we care about your salvation."" And they don't care what their child really thinks about it. It's not about helping your child discover themselves, it's all about herd mentality and authority.

&amp;#x200B;

I have seen what alcohol can do to people who drink without moderation and I think that it's best for the society that people who are too young don't drink. I can also see how driving a car by someone under the age of 18 can be dangerous. Joining the army should also be allowed from the age of 18 because a soldier should be mature and understand all the risks that come with being in the army. Doing all these things by someone under the age of 18 can bring harm.

&amp;#x200B;

But the state should guarantee religious freedom. And if some child gets disillusioned with the religion of their parents, and starts reading some literature, various philosophies or books of various religions, it only brings good to the child - the more you know the better person you become and you understand the world better so you can make better decisions. It's only for the better of society to have citizens who reach out for various ideas and sources and think critically about what they believe in. Parents should engage in dialogue with their children and talk with them. 

&amp;#x200B;

Teenager is not mature enough to drink alcohol, drive a car or join the army - but of course is mature enough to ask questions about the world and have their own opinion on it. It shouldn't be like ""if you are 16 and want to leave your church, it's simple, just wait two years"". It should rather be like ""if you are 16 and want to leave your church, it's very simple, just stop going there"". And don't tell me anything about drinking alcohol underage because I never said that we should allow children to drink.

The two women were attacked by a drunk man while they waited at the Wittenau train station with a baby in a pram, Deutsche Welle reported.

The man grabbed one of the women by her arm and shook her, demanding she speak German, according to a statement from the Berlin police. He then verbally threatened them and attempt to hit them with a belt buckle, it said.

The women escaped by boarding a train. German police arrested the 37-year-old attacker, who is under investigation for “harassment” and “attempting to cause bodily harm”.""",,/r/europe/comments/cq86ed/women_targeted_for_speaking_turkish_in_racist/ewuh73y/,0n0mat0poeia,1565780959

3188,"That all sounds fine and dandy until you start going through the areas where EU military forces are decades behind the US in capability and/or lack the capability in sufficient quantity to make a difference. This concerns mundane stuff like aerial refuelling, reconnaissance, intelligence assets etc. 

If Russia openly invaded and seized the Baltic states, for instance (let's set aside the likelihood of that happening), the EU would probably eventually be able to kick them out – after a year or so of massive and expensive mobilisation effort trying to assemble the disparate national military forces, or rather the combat-effective parts of them, into an expeditionary force capable of taking on a major power. Ask yourself how likely it even is that the EU's effort wouldn't stumble right at the door because many EU countries would refuse to participate. 

The EU lacks the kind of forces that could be deployed on moment's notice in sufficient numbers, with sufficient air cover and logistical support to actually thwart a naked military aggression against its periphery states. That's a simply military fact and you can bet Putin knows about it. If Europe's alliance with the US collapses and the US withdraws its forces and guarantees from Europe, then it will leave Europe incredibly vulnerable to blackmail and extortion by the likes of Putin.

You are absolutely correct that the EU needs to build up independent and credible capabilities, but I am a realist and looking at the completely lack of political leadership in Europe in this area, I am not optimistic. It would even in the best of cases take decades for the EU to become a credible military player capable of standing on its own in all areas of defence policy. And this is just speaking about conventional warfare; an EU standing on its own would also need a much more distributed and credible nuclear deterrence to play on the same field as Russia; somehow I just can't picture e.g. the German government paying for the development and deployment of nuclear-tipped IRBMs aimed in response to Russian intermediate-range missiles.",Czech Republic,/r/europe/comments/cq5xab/of_course_the_us_supports_a_no_deal_it_makes_a/ewuh8ku/,Victor_D,1565781004

3190,"No, i am correct, wikipedia is mixing money and reserves as explained in this article https://www.cnbc.com/id/100760150

&gt; So we can see that while the central bank's balance sheet does expand, the only impact in the private sector is to change the composition of the banks' balance sheets, exchanging bonds for reserves. The total assets of the private sector don't change. Hence no money is being created any more than, say, if someone sold their stocks and put the money into bonds. 

															 																										 														

&gt; Now, some people will argue that reserves are money. But let me explain why I don't think reserves are money. 

															 																										 													
															 																										 														

&gt; What is money? Money has three functions: a medium of exchange, a store of value and a unit of account. Bank reserves are a store of value; they may be a unit of account; but they are definitely not a medium of exchange. 

															 																										 														

&gt; Only financial institutions can hold reserves at the central bank. You can't go into a store and buy a loaf of bread with bank reserves, as you can with, say, a dollar bill or a checking account at a your local bank. Reserves just sit there. Although they do earn interest, that doesn't mean they are money. You can rent out your house and get an income stream from that, too, but that doesn't make your house money.",France,/r/europe/comments/cq6f41/german_economy_contracts_as_export_engine/ewuh8zk/,idee_fx2,1565781017

https://www.faz.net/aktuell/finanzen/deutsche-finanzbranche-rechnet-mit-hartem-brexit-16329270.html  

It's in German, so here's a summary: The Center for Financial Studies did a survey in Germany amongst the financial business. 51% think a hard Brexit is likely, 31% think it's very likely. Only 11% believe that a hard Brexit can be avoided.  
2/3 believe that the German financial markets are sufficiently prepared to deal with the fallout. 70% think that the EU should not offer new compromises, preferring a hard cut to further uncertainty.
Last not least: 88% think that in case of a hard Brexit more financial business will move from the UK to Europe, offering new business opportunities.  
So, yeah. It seems that at least among the financial services in Europe a hard Brexit is regarded rather as an opportunity for more business rather than a scary prospect.

They are kind of the news source of record in the UK, sort of like the AP in the US.

As for the Independent; large newspapers in the UK have a history of firmly supporting one political party or the other (that's true in the US as well, but it's more blatant and consistent over time in the UK). ""Everyone"" knows that the Telegraph reports the view of the Tory party and the Guardian the view of the Labor party (more or less).

It actually took years for the nazi to seize power and start their march to madness.

Now let me ask you this : How many times have you thought and had empathy for all those poor Germans from the 30's who got dragged into something they didn't want?

My guess is probably not much. Because In a way they are part responsible because they let it happens.

The truth is, out of those 17 millions you claim that want to stay in the EU, a lot actually despise the EU and its political aspect. A good chunk want to stay to keep the economic benefits, no more, no less. Which is probably why the opposition isn't even pro-remain either but pursue its own Brexit delusion. Which is why it will happen, no matter the consequences for millions of other Europeans.

Not one of racial superiority. The class divisions of the time were based upon ""how close your lineage is to originating from the peninsula?"", not ""how white you are?"".

For example: 

Even the Spanish accounts for the Great Temple massacre by Alvarado paint it as what it was. A betrayal and downright violent massacre of the Aztec nobles during their most sacred holiday. During the celebration itself as if that wasn’t enough.

The encomienda system was pretty fucked up and while slavery was “illegal” in the Spanish Empire, forced labor thrived with this system.

The only thing that makes it “better” than the British colonization of US/Canada, was that the Spanish conquest was considered to be an evangelization of people’s (from their POV) and therefore the Indians could be converted to Catholicism.

3842,"The best explanation of why a market economy works so well (compared to a socialist economy):

&gt; Another indispensable feature of market economies,
which no socialist economy has yet been able to replace,
is the fact that market competition is an ongoing
trial-and-error process, coupled with extensive feedback
mechanisms (see Hayek 2002 [1968]). We do not know,
from the outset, how to organise a successful enterprise or
industry (let alone an entire economy). We find out by trying
lots of different things, with most of them failing, but
some succeeding, and the latter ones getting more widely
adopted.

&gt; A market economy is a testing ground, in which different
business ideas, different management styles, different
organisational models and different industry structures
can be tried and tested in competition with one another.
For example, integrated models, where companies perform
a lot of functions in-house, can compete freely with
specialised models, where companies outsource many
functions to external contractors. In this way, we find out
where specialisation is more appropriate, and where integration
is more appropriate.

&gt; It is a common misunderstanding that the main role
of competition is to act as a spur: we work harder when
we are under competitive pressure than we do when we
can take our current position for granted. But this was
never the main issue: socialist economies had other (less
benign) ways of spurring people on. What they lacked,
however, was the knowledge-creating capacity of competition.
This is the main role of competition in economic life. Socialist economies deprive themselves of the vast
amount of knowledge created by competition. To a lesser
extent, so do market economies that hinder the competitive
process, for example, by erecting barriers to market

the reason for that is a bit different though.

Many jews escaped Germany in the 30s, considering the Netherlands a safe country and generally welcoming of Jews. Unfortunately the Netherlands had an excellent administration system, that included religion in their records, and so did the Jewish council, registering every jew.

3870,"&gt; Yes, but most EU countries have taken on rather differing industrial and commercial approaches in the past, most of Eastern Europe not having much choice, development levels also vary more across the EU than within individual member states. It leaves a vast variation across the EU when compared to a single country.

I don't think it's any different than other political structures of comparable size. Look at the United States: California, the Midwest with the Rust belt, New England, the South, all vastly different. As long as the benefits outweigh some downsides here and there it worth it.

&gt; Of course you are, it might be fine because you see some other benefit, but if the EU applies a large external tariff on say, oranges to protect orange growers in the EU, you end up paying more for oranges than you otherwise might. And the EU might end up trading away protections for your local paper producers in exchange for protections for orange producers somewhere else..

The price is of course a factor but shouldn't, and isn't for me, the only one when buying something. Cheap often correlates with low quality (since you talk about Chinese steel which is notorious for quality issues) and you might even end up paying more. If there are legitimate reasons for a reasonably higher price, than I'm fine with paying a bit more.

&gt; The EU hasn't got a trade agreement with China, nor has the US, Singapore has and it seems to be a reasonable one, the same goes for Switzerland.

Singapore is like 3/4 Chinese so it's hardly a surpise if they get a preferential deal. And incidentally Switzerland particpates in the single market which has nothing to with this, right? A deal with a small country that acts as a proxy for access to the EU market, of course that's appealing to China.

It surely would have resolved this quicker than this seemingly endless nuisance that Brexit turned out to be. That would have been better in my opinion.

&gt; The pressure is that leaving with no-deal will be costly for the UK. The EU taking a position and holding it is pressure on the UK.

3871,"I wouldn't say Germany is perfect in this regard, I think Scotland is better at this, but if someone from England moved to Germany and obtained German citizenship, they would be accepted as German by most Germans. In a 2014 survey about immigrants and ""Germanness"" (https://www.projekte.hu-berlin.de/de/junited/deutschland-postmigrantisch-1/),  people were asked ""Which of the following things are in your opinion important for being a German?"". 

- 96.8%: A command of the German language.

- 78.9%: German citizenship

- 40.8%: Speaking German without any accent

- 37.8%: Not wearing a headscarf

- 37.0%: German ancestry

So if you have German citizenship and speak German fluently, you would be accepted as a German by the majority. From my personal perspective, I would add that even the majority of those people who would expect ""proper Germans"" to speak without any accent or have German ancestry would accept you as a German if you strongly self-identify as a German and are well integrated in the local community, as a regular at the local football club, for example. In this case you would simply be accepted as the exception to the general rule.

Obviously, in the case of England and Scotland there is no specific English or Scottish citizenship, and the language criterion is unlikely to impress people given that so many people speak English. This is why it matters so much here if people are open-minded and welcoming. I have no doubt that this is way more common in Scotland than in England.

Regarding hyphenated identities. This is not really a thing in German, except for people with a Turkish background, where a large number of people still identifies as Turkish. I personally don't mind hyphenated identities and I have never met people who criticize US citizens for hyphenated identities. But what is really weird (and this is criticized a lot indeed, also by myself) is when Americans consider themselves Germans (non-hyphenated) without ever having set foot in the country and without speaking the language.

If you push it even further and bring up the atrocities committed by the conquistadors people still know that of all possible outcomes it was better to be a native under Spanish rule than under British rule. This is because the Spanish were interested into expanding their empire while bringing the natives into it by forcing them to convert, unlike the British or the French who pushed the natives further inland every time their borders grew.

3976,"&gt;And rural regions have different priorities than cities, mountainous regions are different from lowlands, coastal regions different from landlocked regions, etc.

Yes, but most EU countries have taken on rather differing industrial and commercial approaches in the past, most of Eastern Europe not having much choice, development levels also vary more across the EU than within individual member states. It leaves a vast variation across the EU when compared to a single country.

&gt;This is the contract, you give up something but gain much more in return because the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.

The question is whether you do get 'much more in return'. It's certainly a different approach, it means that any trade deals are being carried out with a large market to back them up, but it also means that there are more caveats.

&gt;And so what, I'm not really losing anything if the EU also protects something that's not of much relevance in my little corner of the world.

Of course you are, it might be fine because you see some other benefit, but if the EU applies a large external tariff on say, oranges to protect orange growers in the EU, you end up paying more for oranges than you otherwise might. And the EU might end up trading away protections for your local paper producers in exchange for protections for orange producers somewhere else.. 

And that is part and parcel of working as a collective group, it is undoubtedly good for smaller EU economies, it's good for countries like France where agricultural support and protection are core to agreements and so on.  It might be less appealing if you are a country that uses a lot of the stuff that the EU wants to protect, but don't produce much domestically (like say, steel).  It might not be great if the things you export are less prominent in EU trade agreements because most other EU members don't have the same focus on them (like say, services..) or where the internal market isn't quite there yet either..

&gt;You seem to have a stangely distorted, inflated sense of scale in regards to the UK though that seems to be a common theme in the public discourse there these days. ""Massive"" is certainly not the right word for the UK. The Chinese market is massive, the EU and US are big markets, the UK is medium-sized at best.

The UK is the 5th/6th largest market on the planet, that's pretty massive.. It's 2x the size of Canada's and about 1/7th of the EU market (of 27 states..). 

The US, EU and Chinese markets are larger than anyone else else by a large margin, then you have massive markets like those of Japan, Germany, the UK, France, India, Italy, and Brazil.. And then another 180 odd much smaller markets, the UK's domestic market is bigger than that of South Korea, the Netherlands, Hungary, Croatia and Slovenia combined... It's not one of the top 3 economic superpowers, but it's a massive market.

&gt;I wouldn't count on it because the Chinese modus operandi boils down to taking without reciprocating if they can get away with it because that's what they think they are entitled to after the West has exploited the rest of the world (including China) for centuries.

The EU hasn't got a trade agreement with China, nor has the US, Singapore has and it seems to be a reasonable one, the same goes for Switzerland. 

&gt;Well, the EU isn't run by Trump. But I agree in retrospective the EU should have been more assertive from the start considering how thing are only getting worse it seems.

I'm not sure that being more assertive would have led to a better outcome, and while you are right that the EU isn't run by Trump, I'm reasonably sure that that's not a bad thing. The EU should almost certainly have been far more capable of making use of the leverage it had than Trump would be.

&gt;Not sure what pressure you refer to, there is certainly none from the EU. The EU has made its postion clear for a long time and now the ball is in the UK's court. The only thing we are doing is waiting for the end of October.

The pressure is that leaving with no-deal will be costly for the UK. The EU taking a position and holding it is pressure on the UK. And the EU has a lot of leverage here, the transition deal on offer as part of the WA is insanely valuable to the UK. Yet it seems not valuable enough to cover what the EU would like in return.",United Kingdom - Personally vouched for by /u/colourfox,/r/europe/comments/cpai91/british_diplomats_to_pull_out_from_eu/ewsad18/,-ah,1565723371

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_in_Uruguay


&gt;Scholars do not agree about the first settlers in what is now Uruguay; but there is evidence that there was human presence some 10,000 years BCE, the Homo catalanensis culture. **Indigenous Uruguayans disappeared in the 1830s**, and with the exception of the Guaraní, little is known about these peoples, and even less about their genetic characteristics.[4]


&gt;Native peoples had almost disappeared by the time of Independence as a result of European diseases and constant warfare. European genocide culminated on April 11, 1831 with the Massacre of Salsipuedes, where most of the Charrua men were killed by the Uruguayan army on the orders of President Fructuoso Rivera, and the remaining 300 Charrua women and children were divided as household slaves and servants among Europeans. By 1840 there were only 18 surviving Charrua in Uruguay.[8]. According to the history professor and journalist Lincoln Maiztegui Casas, “the disappearance of the Charrúa people was a gradual process that took more than 200 years, and the root cause was territorial occupation by Europeans”.[9]",England,/r/europe/comments/cpqp88/an_incredibly_detailed_map_of_spains_exploration/ewsaymi/,JeuyToTheWorld,1565723728

Also there were Christians already in Finland and for example Christian Proper Finns (the tribe of Southwestern Finland) fought against pagan Tavastians. And Proper Finns allied with Swedes to fight Tavastians. The first crusade is also thought to be a propaganda story with little historical evidence it ever happened. To my understanding, it wasn't really any misery for Finns to be ruled from Stockholm.

4034,"&gt; How is that related to any of what is under discussion here?

Because many just point at poor socialist countries, as if there are not poor capitalist countries.

&gt; But we do have a clear correlation. Neighbouring and equally wealthy countries in the Interwar era ended up vastly different once some of them had been subjected to socialism/communism for decades.

While certainly true. It's not like the thing about them having been colonial powers and thus controlling quite many resources around the world already did not have major impact.

For example, while many argue East Germany is poor(er) because of socialism (it didn't help that the USSR removed many factories), one shouldn't forget East Germany was poorer than West Germany even before the Soviet Union. Just as an example, many important and rather rich cities during the HRE were in what would be considered Western Germany, as the Rhine was kind of a trading hub and to the north there was Hamburg and Lübeck, kind of the main cities of the Hanseatic League. Eastern Germany on the other hand had not much of such big big cities.

For example, look at Turkey who also wasn't rich and did not become rich by not being socialist. Actually it had about the same GDP per capita as Poland.

The only countries where one can truly claim capitalism worked wonders (or at least absence of socialism), are the Scandinavian countries, the rich western European countries, were quite wealthy for a long time, mainly because of colonialism.

The correlation is rather if you are allied with the West aka ex colonial powers you you probably ended up richer.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/cpeukn/why_socialism_by_albert_einstein/ewsbm0n/,CDWEBI,1565724127

4109,"&gt;If we aren't flexible enough to have the ability to change our minds on which mp's get to sit in parliament when the political situation changes drastically (as with a pm resigning) then I'm not sure that's entirely fair.

The point is that the PM resigning isn't a drastic change to the political situation, it's a personality change at most. And if it turns into a drastic change to the political situation, VONC's or other 'no-confidence' measures are the tool that our elected MP's have to manage that (which would generally lead to a GE..).

&gt;People should be allowed to change (or not change) their minds, and that should be reflected in parliament.

It is, we have elections quite regularly.. That's sort of the point isn't it?

&gt;I agree that there is normally a GE eventually but it seems to be at the discretion of the ruling party, (or in the event of a vote of no confidence) whereas I think it should be standard practice. If a leader wants to take the country in a different direction from the previous leader I think we should get a proper say in that.

Again, isn't the issue here that the PM doesn't really get to take the country in a different direction, or rather if a majority government wants to change direction, it doesn't need to change PM to do it, and a change of PM doesn't mean a change in direction most of the time. It hasn't with Boris really, his position is only marginally different from where May was in any practical sense.

And of course there are other scenarios where there actually is significant change, where a GE wouldn't be occur too. We are a representative democracy after all, the PM changing is probably not going to change your vote for a local MP, and it is your MP who has a say in who is PM (well a 1/650th..).",United Kingdom - Personally vouched for by /u/colourfox,/r/europe/comments/cprmff/the_tides_of_illiberalism_are_beginning_to_ebb_in/ewrytk7/,-ah,1565716673

4202,"&gt;Yet I'll saying it again, I'm talking about pro brexit MP's who also say this, which is most of them at this point. So no that's the opposite of their job. If they believed there was a net positive rightly or wrongly then them backing it would be fine, but most of them do not believe that.

And how do you know that they don't believe that? They clearly seem to think that the costs are worth the benefits?

&gt;I've not even expressed my direct view on leaving in this thread. But many leave backing MP's have expressed their view and said they are going to vote against that view. The leave MP's are among the people saying it will be bad for the country.

You haven't expressed a direct view, as I said I formed in impression.. Because frankly your position doesn't really make sense otherwise. MP's have not said that they feel leaving will be bad for the country overall, they think that there will be a cost to leaving, that is worth it in the long run, and to be out of the EU..

&gt;But then why do they keep saying they don't think that in debates?

They seem to be saying that the costs of leaving are acceptable, not that they think it'll be bad for the country.

&gt;You mean like Theresa May who spoke about the harm leaving would do and then as PM talked about the harm a no-deal would do and then put enough read lines in place to know they would not get a deal that would pass the commons.  Or Jeremy Hunt who has openly talked about the negative effects and the brain drain that has already started in many sectors.

Isn't that MP's changing their position as they have more information and as the debate has shifted? I assume you aren't suggesting that MP's can't change their views..

&gt;It really seems like you own desires around brexit one way or the other are clouding you ability to see the erosion of our political structures.

Not at all, I would like the UK out of the EU with a deal in place, and over time I shifted from a pro-EU to a pro-leave position, so I can see why MP's might shift their perception about what is right for the country based on their own understanding of the situation..",United Kingdom - Personally vouched for by /u/colourfox,/r/europe/comments/cpq4es/more_brits_voted_remain_than_there_are_people_in/ewrn01d/,-ah,1565709248

We negotiated in good faith that the UK is grown up enough to do the same. It’s not our fault, that the UK completely screwed up their domestic process. It was hard enough for the EU negotiators to keep certain wishes from member states like Spain with Gibraltar out of the negotiations.

The negotiations ended shortly before 29th of March. Everyone on the EU side expected the UK to leave. They are still here cause they came back on their knees begging for more time for the ratification of this negotiated treaty.

From our side the negotiations ended Boxer the departure date on 29th of March, after nearly constantly 2 years of negotiation.

4257,"&gt; And how do you know that they don't believe that? They clearly seem to think that the costs are worth the benefits?

For the final time, because they in their own words have said so; so either they are lying and think it's great or are acting against their better judgment for purely political reasons.

&gt; MP's have not said that they feel leaving will be bad for the country overall, they think that there will be a cost to leaving, that is worth it in the long run, and to be out of the EU..

You clearly have not been watching parliamentary debates as you claim, as then is only a few dozen MP's that hold with what you are saying.

&gt;They seem to be saying that the costs of leaving are acceptable, not that they think it'll be bad for the country.

Costs that they say there will be little to no benefit from for the country. Thats harming the country. They may be acceptable to them, but thats still them acting against the public interest.

&gt;Isn't that MP's changing their position as they have more information and as the debate has shifted? I assume you aren't suggesting that MP's can't change their views..

The more information that has come about as it has gone on has been against their position not in favour of. The only thing that has changed towards it is the political landscape. Change their view sure, with a rational, but they are not saying the harm they talked about they now believed to be wrong, they just say it's not relevant.

4262,"&gt; It is always the responsibility of the individual to be knowledgeable and informed about what they're doing. How could it be anyone else's?

Free and independent media is one of the pillars of democracy and indeed its is one of the factors included when measuring the level of democracy of countries. The argument here is that an un-informed decision shouldn't be equated to be at the same democratic level as an informed decision - that is, the level of democracy isn't the same between countries with different levels of media freedom. Granted that this doesn't apply to the UK, as it has abundant media plurality - but the underlying reason for why free and independent media is essential for democracy is the implication that it allows for an informed citizenry, freely. When one considers that people voted without knowing the implications of their vote, or even what the vote would entail, arguably that is not the decision of an informed citizenry - *not unlike* in the case of a country with lacking free and independent media. One can make an argument that is even more damning, from a democratic point of view, when it mostly seems to have been about an emotional decision than an informed decision. 

I honestly don't see how it can be the responsibility of a people in a country with no media freedom to be able to make democratic choices, by definition - The information people are fed is not free nor independent.",,/r/europe/comments/cpq4es/more_brits_voted_remain_than_there_are_people_in/ewro8gt/,Idontknowmuch,1565710065

4279,"&gt;Yes what I said, their actions do not match with the model of democracy we have.

You are talking about the actions of our representatives, in Parliament here right? How does that not match with the model of democracy we have? It seems to match it pretty much perfectly.. 

&gt;No it's not as it's wasn't campaign as such, it promised all routes similatianly, as such thats putting a bunch of options under one umbrella. All research has showed if we asked, remain, norwegian model, canadian model or no deal, or something to that affect we'd not be having this conversation. It was deliberately skewed. Thats like if come the next election you got to vote for tories or not tories and then a dice was rolled to see who got.

Again, the referendum was purely about whether people wanted the UK in or outside of the EU. The campaigns (both sides) offered a slew of different possibilities if we were in or out of the EU, from hard and soft brexits, through to EU reform and closer integration. The question however was in out, not about a specific exit (or a specific remain for that matter, there 'remain and reform' call was major, the 'we can limit FoM' thing was in there and so on.

&gt;Yes they have https://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/who-we-are-and-what-we-do/elections-and-referendums/past-elections-and-referendums/eu-referendum

That link isn't to anything that supports the claim you made..

&gt;No, the government's own internal recommendations were against it. Thats very far from my own subjective opinion.

The governments external recommendation was, but then the government position was that the UK should remain, that was a political position.. The internal government documents we've seen more recently indicate the impact of leaving and what has to be mitigated, they don't contradict the issues that the UK has with the EU..

&gt;I've not seen any evidence that suggest it will be better managed by the UK, just subjective speculation. 

I haven't said that it'll be better managed by the UK, that it will be managed by the UK is however a fact..

&gt;There is also a lot of speculation that it will be managed worse at things like workers rights. consumer rights and quality standards will be put at risk when we leave. To be honest I care most about those.

I care a lot about those, I am generally unhappy that the EU has in some places eroded them, in others hasn't acted to secure them and that the Unions, Labour movement and Labour party don't seem to get any credit for the work they did in securing them in the first place.  And like most people, I think they are important so while the Tories might try to reduce them, they will face opposition, and Labour governments in the future will reverse any damage.. You know, like how we ended up with most of those things in the first place.

&gt;Yet studies suggest it will have a poor impact of social issues as well as economic ones, so no it's not the case here.

Really? Which studies.  Everything I have seen seems to be extrapolation of economic projections rather than studies on social impact.

&gt;People were pointing out it's flawed when the out come was predicated to go the other way.

So.. The people who thought it'd go remain have been claiming it is flawed when the result wasn't what they wanted? Well yes.. But frankly the predictions that it would go remain were incredibly tenuous if you looked at short term or long term polling. The UK has always been relatively euro sceptic, the high point for EU support was in 1975, the referendum wasn't a low point (it would have gone far more toward leave if held in 2012 for example)..

&gt;No they should be fighting for what they think is best. Thats like saying MP's who wanted to surrender in WWII were doing a really good job and respecting our democracy.

They are fighting for what they think is right. The issue appears to be that you disagree. That doesn't make it undemocratic.",United Kingdom - Personally vouched for by /u/colourfox,/r/europe/comments/cpq4es/more_brits_voted_remain_than_there_are_people_in/ewrcg0b/,-ah,1565701794

4392,"Popular mobilisation in defence of the rule of law deserves western support

The tides of illiberalism in central and eastern Europe are in partial retreat. High-handed leaders who scoffed for years at the rule of law are losing public trust and power. This trend, though uneven and not irreversible, is heartening: some of the region’s countries have taken a wrong turning over the past decade, betraying the civic democratic promise of the 1989 anti-communist revolutions.

It would be a mistake to think that well-judged EU policies, backed by the US, have contributed to the new trend. The role of what we used to call the world’s leading liberal democracies has been relatively small. Rather, illiberalism is on the defensive mainly because hundreds of thousands of the region’s citizens, impatient with politicians who feed corruption and bend justice to their own purposes, have risen up against it.

The most prominent examples are Romania, Slovakia and the Czech Republic. In all three countries, the rule of law was eroding under pressure from politicians borrowing populist methods from Viktor Orban and Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the Hungarian and Polish leaders. In Romania and Slovakia, it is a grim fact that it required public revulsion at murder to stop the rot.

In late July, the abduction and killing of a 15-year-old Romanian girl prompted such outrage that the nation’s constitutional court struck down controversial changes to the legal system passed by the ruling Social Democrats. The chief purpose of these changes was to undermine the judiciary’s independence and protect party bigwigs and their friends against corruption charges. But prosecutors and citizens alike seized on the murder to argue that the changes weakened the state’s ability to tackle serious crime in general.

The landmark decision came two months after several other blows against Romanian illiberalism. Liviu Dragnea, the Social Democrat leader and strongman behind the government, lost his appeal against a conviction on corruption charges and began a prison sentence of three and a half years. The party’s vote collapsed in the European Parliament elections. In a simultaneous referendum, Romanians supported a ban on pardons or amnesties for corruption cases, as well as a ban on emergency decrees to change the justice system.

In Slovakia’s case, the turning point was the February 2018 murder of Jan Kuciak — an investigative journalist probing the ties between business, organised crime and politics — and his fiancée. Mass demonstrations brought down Prime Minister Robert Fico, the dominant figure of Slovak politics for the previous 12 years. Then, last March, the national presidential election was won by Zuzana Caputova, a political outsider who campaigned against the corrupt, clientelistic status quo — but in a deliberately mild and reasoned manner.

Andrej Babis, the billionaire Czech prime minister, clings to power after being rocked by the biggest anti-government demonstrations since the Velvet Revolution swept away communism. Public discontent focuses on the entanglement of his political and business roles, which the EU authorities suspect — and Mr Babis denies — amount to a conflict of interest. After campaigning with a Donald Trump-style red baseball cap bearing the slogan “Strong Czechia”, he topped the polls in his country’s European Parliament elections but his party was crushed in Prague, the liberal-leaning Czech capital.

To interpret these various events calls for perspective. Central and eastern Europe is not a monolithic region. The most extreme version of regional illiberalism, that of Mr Orban’s Hungary, has a stronger grip on power than others precisely because it has gone furthest in dismantling or corroding the institutions of a civic democracy. The Polish variant, that of Mr Kaczynski’s Law and Justice party, appears on course to win re-election in October because its policies appeal to millions of voters and the opposition is disunited.

Moreover, the Czech, Romanian and Slovak protests have been directed largely against corruption, cronyism and abuses of the law rather than in support of the western-style liberal norms embraced by the pro-democracy revolutionaries of 1989. Little suggests that hostility to non-European migrants and refugees, or lukewarm interest in deep EU integration, is fading.

4429,"Ok I'll try this again 


Figures show a 3 percent increase on wage growth above inflation on average yes we can agree 

What I'm saying is that those figures and calculations don't include every aspect of an economy that figures into disposable income it's like using gnp over GDP to argue success of an individual economy. It's doesn't show the whole context 


So to that point , if people are seeing a percentage increase in wages but the economy is not seeing a percentage increase one would assume (based on the market confidence) that people are instead saving or paying down debt instead of buying goods. We would agree that would be the normal outcome I presume? 

However what I'm pointing out is that instead of that or even stagnation in the debt market we are seeing savings figures lowering and debt figures increasing...therefore some factors are clearly applying that is affecting the market outside the basic parameters or wage growth.

So if you look at what is covered in inflation , ie what products services etc are used to gauge the inflation rate (or cost to the consumer) that is used to compare to the growth rate to get figure we have, whats in there? Well you'll notice that social services aren't in there. So if the government cuts the pensioners free TV licence or reduce services provided to an area or restrict further medical services from the free public sector these additional costs get applied to the consumer but not the inflation index or at least not properly 

This is the point people seem to be missing. The UK economy is shrinking , that means less money into the government, the country is already cutting services to save costs so if the economy continues to shrink so will government services , consumers have to pick up the slack for these hidden additional costs and these additional costs are applying to UK consumers more and more over the last few years 


So if we put all the data and context together you can see exactly why that even with high wage growth numbers the real wage growth is behind Germany's at lower than 1 percent. Less money for the government to spend on services means more money the population have to fork out to maintain their same standard of living. This is why figures for debt are increasing and savings decreasing while at the same time the UK standard of living is decreasing even though average wage growth is strong 


People make mistakes when they take one economic variable in isolation and make market statements based solely on that one data point.

4450,"&gt;And they didn't both before the ref or after, thats them failing again, I've mentioned this one already.

Right, but that is their job.. They represent us, we elected them. That seems to be an issue with representative democracy (although failing might be a bit harsh, they seem to be doing a good job at representing their constituents, the issue is that the country is split and so are MP's).

&gt;The electorate was given a single option that encompassed many options all of which were promised while being mutually exclusive, the electoral commission has said this was deeply flawed. And what MP's have done since is not in our best interest.

The referendum was purely about a direction, in the EU or outside of it. The idea that it was supposed to dictate a route out of the EU to MP's is flawed, and indeed that would be a problem in the context of a representative democracy.

The EC also hasn't said that the approach to the referendum was flawed, it approved the question and so on.

&gt;Thats not what I was talking about, but of course it was and that has been pointed out by the electoral commission.

Firstly, the Electoral Commission has not said that the referendum breaches or otherwise harms representative democracy, and secondly if that isn't your point, what is?

&gt;Not about what I think, about what every study from both the civil service and third parties shows it's hugely damaging. So there for any action towards it is not in the public interest.

Again, you are conflating objective and subjective positions here, and weighing data and outcomes based on your perception of a good outcome. There is a lot of evidence to suggest that leaving the EU will, in the short term, leave the UK worse off economically. There is also a lot of evidence to suggest that leaving the EU will mean that UK governments will exercise the competencies currently held by the EU. If your view is that the economic is more important then yes, this (in your view) damages the country. However if your view is that governance is more important, then remaining damages the country...

The public interest is varied, we often take policy decisions that are 'poor' economic choices because we think the social or environmental impact is more important. That is true here too.

&gt;No it's that their actions are not what they are elected for and our political system has been tainted to such an extent that this is not seen as an issue.

That sounds exactly like you not liking the outcome and so trying to claim that it is the system that is flawed.. Surely our MP's (elected after the referendum, largely on manifestos to leave the EU) are representing us right now, and working toward what they think is best. Remain MP's seem to have been fighting quite hard, as have leave supporting MP's... Isn't that what happens in a representative democracy?

&gt;An MP used to get away with ""I believe this is whats best"" or ""this is what's best for my constituency"", but now they can go on record say they are voting for something they know will harm the country and that's never been ok before.

You think that on balance it will harm the country, the MP's in question seem to feel that it will, in the long term, be better than remaining in the EU..

4462,"&gt;university graduates can't find work and experienced people are seeing their salaries decimated as there's just so much competition for jobs

To be fair, the university thing being the answer to getting the best jobs and higher salaries was always a scam to get people to keep enrolling and making them pay the fees.

Here in spain for example the university fees raised almost threefold in the last 10 years, and obviously the salaries have not increased proportionally so a lot of people are taking what would be the equivalent of an associate degree because you can get it in 2 years and you leave with an education that leaves you ready for working in whatever thing you studied, and doesn't cost an eye and an arm, and since most companies nowadays seem to be more interested in actual experience than a higher level of degree, if you main goal is to find a decent work fast you are good.

Ofc there's people that eventually move from an associate degree to a higher degree or whatever but I honestly wouldn't recommend it as a first choice because with the volatility of the economy, the uncertainty of work and the high cost is definitely not worth it unless you are wealthy and you are not worried about money/work in the short term.",Barcelona (Spain),/r/europe/comments/cpqebh/uk_pay_growth_hits_11year_high_as_employment_boom/ewr5flc/,nagarz,1565695193

4640,"&gt; Yes, but the EU market covers a range of very disparate economies with protectionist tendencies toward a range of industries, which isn't an issue for the UK. The UK doesn't need those concessions.

That's what to single market and its harmonisations are for. The differences of the EU ecomonies are not really much of a factor, the common rules of the single market are what makes it so attractive.
The UK simply prioritises different things it wants to protect. Hopefully you not trying to suggest that there is nothing to protect and Brits are longing for a completely open, unprotected market.

&gt;  I doubt people would look at something like CETA for example and suggest that Canada was screwed over by the EU.

Obviously not or Canada wouldn't have signed it. It only works if there is enough in there that they still benefit enough from the overall deal even if they had to make some concessions. That's the thing, your market size dictates how many concessions the other party is willing to put up with you can push through.

&gt; That's the sort of thing that trade agreements aim to remove though

""Aim"" is the right word, because China has not much of an incentive to remove those restrictions. It's domestic market is massive and will only continue to grow. They will only remove them, if they have served their purpose and aren't needed anymore, not because anyone could push them in trade negotiations.


&gt;  why hasn't the UK accepted the withdrawal agreement already

There are various factors in play, you should probably know this better that me. For one the WA is not a trade deal, it deals with the terms of the UK's depature from the EU and anything that's in there it is seen as a temporary arrangement until a trade deal with the EU is done. Even the no-deal Brexiteer want a trade deal in the long run. Another thing is the current chaotic state of British politics in which a rational approach to those things is basically a minority position. And then it is mostly posturing against the EU (even though they are not fooling anyone and we are clearly seeing what they are doing) because we are still in a phase were Brexiteer think this might work.

So when my class (6 male, 3 female) lined up for the obligatory group-photo he suggested everybody should get naked for the picture.

[Wikileaks even overtly stated](https://theintercept.com/2018/02/14/julian-assange-wikileaks-election-clinton-trump/) ""We believe it would be much better for the GOP to win"", calling Clinton a sociopath.       
      
But I'm not just talking about that. Look at how they responded to the Panama Papers; many politicians across across the world were implicated by the leaks, including in Europe. But Wikileaks framed it as a targeted attack on Putin funded by the U.S.   
   
I used to follow their Twitter account, and some of their responses to international incidents came as quite a shock to me (then a supporter); far from impartial, sometimes tastelessly scoring political points (against Western governments) after something awful happened (their tweet after the 2014 attacks in Paris, for example).       
      
Have [a read of this article](https://thisinterestsme.com/wikileaks-bias/) - it highlights a few of the instances where Wikileaks has acted in a questionable way.     
     
Feel free to disagree, but I don't think Wikileaks is driven solely by a desire to expose the truth *wherever* it may be found. I wouldn't necessarily claim its agenda is to assist 'enemies of The West' either; but I do think its tunnel vision at times is to the benefit of states with skeletons equally deserving of being uncloseted.

The name ""*la Grande Guerre*"" was first coined as a propaganda term by French papers in 1915, and didn't really gain track until 1918 and espescially during the interwar-period. It's a hallmark of French triumphalism, which is precisely the reason nobody uses it today since we all know how that turned out in the end. Besides, there never was anything ""grand"" about it. In hindight, it sounds like a cruel joke. 

German biologist Ernst Haeckel was the first one to call ""this first world-war"" (""*Dieser erste Welt-Krieg*"") as early as September 19**14**.

5240,"&gt;The UK's highest ever share of global gdp was in 1960
The rest of the world caught up with the West since 1960. Then emerging economies are not emerging anymore, they are fully fledged economic actors. While it means more wealth being created overall, it only seem natural that those new actors get their own share of the world's economy, which mechanically reduces the humongus share previously monopolised by Western countries. I'm not even talking about whether it's more ethical or fair, it's just a logical consequence of wealth being increasingly shared globally.

Nonetheless, the UK remains much wealthier than the rest of the world, and the average Brit today lives a much more prosperous life (*i.e.* have a much higher quality of life, because this is what it boils down in the end) than the average Brit of 1973. As a matter of fact, this date is a poor choice to compare the financial well-being of Britons, as the late 60's and the 70's were actually an awful time for the British economy.

I'm not saying all is for the best, mind you. We hear similar complaints in France. But that's just the consequence of the rest of the world catching up and the West not being the sole beneficiary of global economic growth anymore. It has little to do with the EU membership, as many Britons are apparently led to believe.

I mean, as a matter of fact, EU membership actually [boosted the British economy](https://voxeu.org/article/how-rich-nations-benefit-eu-membership):

&gt;*A measure of the magnitude of the economic benefits from EU membership is given by the difference between the actual per capita GDP for each country (or labour productivity) and that of its SCM artificial control group. (...) We find that per capita incomes in the UK and Denmark would have been 25% lower (if they had not joined the EU in 1973)*

Oh wait the embryo is completely reliant on exactly this one person he eats from and that caries him around. It doesn't life without the mother. You could argue it's a symbotic being that will grow to a human.

It's not like the embryo appeared in the mother's body by accident, or someone insidiously placed it there. As far as I know it doesn't work that way. You can consider it a symbiotic being if you want, as long as his final stage of development is a human you shouldn't have the right to kill it.

&gt;So you set up a potential life (embryos are not yet able to live without their mother) over the real life of a woman?  

Not over, rather slightly under. Not enough to kill it, but enough to sacrifice at least this 9 months of mother's life.

the rich will continue being rich, not caring about the poor whom they steal from, and have all the wealth at their fingertips to keep their luxurious lives. if bees go extinct, they’ll make their own bee drones, or better yet just go fruits in a lab.

I assume that these used Euros.

Changes in currency exchange rates reflect changes in the underlying economy. Currency changes do not effect GDP, but GDP changes can effect currency rates.

When currencies move against each other, it is because of underlying economic indicators. So, they are related, but in the opposite direction: GDP effects currency.

So, to answer your question, any changes in exchange rates was already factored in, as they are based on GDP. But, you seem to be asking if small changes in exchange rates can change the metrics for GDP per capita. And the answer is no. If your currency devalued, it is because of GDP shrinking.

5386,"The Soviet Union was backed by the US during WWII. It is possible for an organization to have a leftist policy at home but also receive outside support from non-leftist allies due to the idiosyncrasies of geopolitics.

The YPG and allied groups have advanced a leftist (but not Marxist) reorganization of Rojava along their ideology of democratic confederalism. They are by far the most leftist, secular group in that region. Additionally, the US provided them with military support because for a long time they were the only group with their shit together fighting the Islamic State, and the pendulum of US foreign policy has currently swung to “Muslims are worse than Commies,” though of course that’s not always been the case nor will it always be.

So it started as backing them as the only credible opponent to IS that wasn’t a murderous dictator or other jihadists, though there may now be some sense that allowing Turkey to sweep in and massacre a group that has been allied to the US would be bad for courting other US allies in the future. The economic ideology is incidental for US operations in Syria, given the lack of major US business interests operating in the country, though is of course still paramount in US operations in other parts of the globe.

For example countries like Ireland or Luxembourg have already built their economy around their very low corporation tax, and to make that universal now would mean Ireland and Luxembourg would effectively have to redesign their economy.

The reason a shared currency is bad is because when places like Greece had their recession, their currency was fairly stable when it shouldn't have been.  Your currency is meant to crash in that situation and it leads to the country getting more tourism, increasing exports and decreasing imports which will all improve the economy and eventually balance the economic crash that occurred.

And yeah there are times were *She* doesn't want the kid and *He* wants it, but, just from personal experience with friends and from my mother (mother midwife), most of the time it's the man that runs away even before birth or shortly after.

&gt;Where is the fact that tradition often is used as an argument relevant in our conversation ?

It's relevant because it's literally the only thing used to defend bull fighting.

&gt;Since when is the fact that peoople are playing fascist anthem somewhere a proof that this place is fascist by essence ?

It's not just ""somewhere"". This is the first match in Mallorca after the ban. And immediately the far-right Vox party sticks its nose into it AND fascist anthems are used to celebrate the return of bull fighting. Open your eyes, honey.

&gt; Would you say the sam thing after hearing that some football supporters sing fascists anthems ?

I'll say it if the overturning of a ban on football is celebrated by fascist anthems.

5681,"I didn't really have time to reply earlier. Sorry for that. But I'll begin at the end:

&gt; And thats without the added bonus of autoritharism, which is necessary when you simply come and take eveyone's property by force.

Not really. Communism isn't about ""taking everyone's property"". When discussing property with respect to socialism/communism, usually there is a distinction made between personal property and private property. Personal property would be something like the house you live in, private property would be something like an apartment building you own as a landlord to live off of the rent. It would certainly take force to take away your personal property. You wouldn't just leave your house because somebody decides it isn't yours anymore, so there would have to be police kicking you out, or at least the threat of it happening. The same isn't true for private property. To the contrary: A major function of the state and its authority is actually to uphold private property rights. If you own an apartment block and your tenants refuse to pay the rent, you will call the police and eventually have them evicted. 

If there is a new decision that from now on your apartment building won't belong to you anymore, but to the people living in it or to society as a whole (whatever that would mean in detail), you would of course feel robbed, but no police or other force would be necessary. You would just lose the right to have those (former) property rights protected by police.

&gt; Not to mention that you have to stop people from leaving

I don't think many people really ever thought that you could have socialism/communism in some places and capitalism in others. Stalin did, but his ideas of ""socialism"" was basically identical to capitalism with the state holding a monopoly on basically everything. In that scenario, of course the state can act within the capitalist world market as a single big ""corporation for everything"". But IMHO that has little to nothing to do with socialism, let alone communism.

&gt; I mean, maybe, it might work in a postscarcity society. But we're not there yet.

I don't think that's true. Today ""having too little"" isn't a problem anymore, at least not on a global scale. Yes, regionally it's true, but globally we produce way more food than we can eat, and product designers use planned obsolescence to keep the demand for products artificially high. And even the hunger that still exists in some places is more due to misdirected subsidies in 1st world countries that interfere with local food production in other places. In other words, productivity isn't an issue, but distribution is. And while capitalism is great at increasing productivity, it's terrible at distribution, because it leads to the accumulation of wealth in the hands of a small minority of people. Automation just accelerates this tendency further.

&gt; yes, this is where we are biologically, you cannot force nature

Proponents of all ideologies have always claimed that their ideology is based on human nature, and that all other ideologies are therefore against it. That doesn't make it true. There is nothing in human nature that says ""do as little as you possibly can"". Otherwise people wouldn't have hobbies, wouldn't volunteer, wouldn't play, wouldn't read, and also wouldn't take up jobs that don't pay as highly as others they would also qualify for, etc. People do all of that stuff. The question is of course whether or not that intrinsic motivation to do things is enough, and that's a legitimate question. There have been surveys asking people about the effects of a universal basic income: whether they belive that they would keep working in their jobs even if their needs would be covered by the UBI, and also whether they believe most other people would keep working in their jobs. The result was that the vast majority of people said they would keep working in their jobs, but most said they believe that most other people would just stay home and do nothing. ""Lazy people who need to be threatened by poverty to do anything at all"" is how we have been conditioned to think of each of each other, but not what we actually are.

If you look at more modern cities they employ design-philosophies (or lack thereoff) that recall the US more. Wolfsburg and Wuppertal are for example 2 of the most modern cities in Germany but you can also look at the sprawl of the huge metropolises. Try Rome, Paris, Munich for example. 

Maybe to give you an example from my own state: [This city](https://www.google.com/maps/place/25348+Gl%C3%BCckstadt/@53.7890019,9.4199204,1867m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x47b3d952cb0394e3:0x8a51fd33b94453cf!8m2!3d53.7911914!4d9.4260898) was founded in 1617 by the infamous danish king who had loved building stuff (Christian IV). He wanted it to compete with Hamburg. This is around the same time New York was founded and it was largely built up by the same kind of people, dutch merchants. It peaked sometime in the first half of 19th century when it was for some time the capital of the danish administration of the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein and had more than 5.000 inhabitants (which was rather respectable back then). Today it has around 11.000. By comparison [here](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Norderstedt/@53.6997636,9.9784095,5284m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x47b227d14aa4a89f:0x4248963c65836b0!8m2!3d53.6993066!4d10.0008798) is a city in Schleswig-Holstein which is also close to Hamburg but which was founded in 1970 (cobbled together from a number of villages) and has around 80.000 inhabitants.

&gt;Flavio Biondo was the first scholar to have observed (in 1435) linguistic affinities between the Romanian and Italian languages, as well as their common Latin origin.[24] When comparing Romanian with other Romance languages, linguists noticed its peculiarities which can be detected at all linguistic levels.[25] In the early 19th century, the Slovene linguist, Jernej Kopitar, suggested that Romanian emerged through the relexification either of an ancient Balkan language or of a Slavic idiom, instead of directly developing from Vulgar Latin.[26] Paul Wexler published a similar hypothesis in 1997.[26] Friedrich Diez, who was one of the first German scholars systematically studying Romance philology, described Romanian (""Wallachian"") as a semi-Romance language in the early 19th century.[27] Due to the high ratio of Slavic loanwords, Romanian used to be even regarded[by whom?] as a Slavic language.[28] Nevertheless, as linguist Graham Mallinson emphasizes, ""Romanian in its various forms retains enough of its Latin heritage at all linguistic levels to qualify for membership of the Romance family in its own right"".[29]",,/r/europe/comments/covj8k/these_european_toponyms_all_derive_from_the_same/ewnx53w/,AndreiXM,1565594731

5867,"does it really?

Surnames are a relatively new invention.

&gt;During the modern era, many cultures around the world adopted family names, particularly for administrative reasons, especially during the age of European expansion and particularly since 1600. Notable examples include the Netherlands (1795–1811), Japan (1870s), Thailand (1920), and Turkey (1934). Nonetheless, their use is not universal: Icelanders, Burmese, Javanese, and many people groups in East Africa do not use family names.

That's why when u look into some countries for example Germany, you'll get a lot of family names that are basically professions. Muller (Miller), Schmit (blacksmith), etc.

When they all decided we need family names to identify individuals, they invented stuff and it varies from area to area.

In Romania in the south most family names end with -escu or -anu (Eminescu, Constantinescu, Basescu, Iliescu, Ceausescu, Tariceanu, Plesoianu, etc.) while in Transylvania they are mosly varied from Hungarian, Slavic or Romanian origin, and in the East (Moldova) they are mostly natural items with some being Poama-Neagra (black-fruit), Padurean (of the forest), Pierdevara (waste-of-time), Floarea (flower) or family names which start with Of (Aaniţei, Aancuţei, Afloarei, etc.)",,/r/europe/comments/covj8k/these_european_toponyms_all_derive_from_the_same/ewnxse1/,AndreiXM,1565595651

5954,"I totally agree that it wouldn't be an easy task. That said, I don't think creating strong regional passenger rail networks in these denser areas would be that expensive in the grand scheme of the federal transportation budget (about 72 billion annually). In fact, most transportation experts argue that in the long run rail transport is generally cheaper/a better investment when you price in the full scope of health, social, and environmental externalities. 

Rail is much cheaper to maintain than highways, produces massively less pollution per person than cars, and is much safer than car based travel. It's also cheaper for the commuter when gas, maintenance, insurance, initial cars costs, etc are priced in. These cost savings add up. 

There are added difficulties of creating transportation networks that involve several states, as you point out. However, this doesn't mean it would have to be a federal issue. There are plenty of examples of interstate cooperation in rail investments, the most familiar to me being the interstate agencies that run the rail systems that bridge NYC, ct, and New Jersey. 

Finally, it's also important to recognize that per mile construction costs tend to be higher in the US than in Western Europe and Japan. While part of this can be attributed to higher labor costs and things the transit agencies can't be blamed for, most of it seems to come from substandard project planning and implementation.

I agree it wouldn't be easy to make this system work, but a modern high speed rail system in certain places in the US would be a huge economic win for this regions and populations. The fact policy makers aren't pushing these solutions is, in my opinion, a fantastic structural mistake.

It's late for me now, but I can provide some sources for my claims tomorrow if your interested. There's a few really great resources on international cost comparisons and some great new work being done on projecting more accurate external transit costs.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/covht7/deutsche_bahn_german_rail_nailing_the_ad_for/ewnt2mk/,metzless,1565589502
