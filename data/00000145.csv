183,"&gt; It seems you overestimate the value of a trade agreement for the ROI and underestimates the importance of an open border for the ROI.

Nope.  I'm simply pointing out that the only variable that the RoI has to work with is the trade agreement or not -- the RoI will get a hard RoI-NI border, no matter what choices the RoI makes in this process.

&gt; For the ROI an open border is a fundamental necessity, without you have violence again.

The importance that the RoI places on not having a border is irrelevant if it's not going to be an option available to the RoI.

&gt; The WA isn't a or the trade deal. 

No, that's true.  But the only reason for the WA to fall through would be because of the backstop.  The only reason the backstop is in the picture is because the RoI can veto the trade agreement that would follow the WA and in good part eliminate the value of the WA to all parties concerned.

&gt; For the EU, the view is simple. Follow the ROI on this.

Correct, because what the EU particularly cares about is the trade agreement, and if the RoI objects to the WA, she will veto the trade agreement.

I'm not saying that the EU should deviate from the RoI and offer a WA without the backstop while the RoI objects.  I'm saying that the RoI should drop the backstop demand, and that it would be irrational for the RoI not to do so, because she's got no chance of the UK agreeing to a backstop in exchange for anything that the RoI is going to put on the table.

&gt; The EU has also a long breathing space in the process. Sooner or later the UK will ask for a trade deal and in agreement in the future an open border in NI will be part of it.

Nope.  As I've said repeatedly, the UK will not trade NI for a trade agreement.

&gt; Overall the odds are high that the UK has lost NI even now.

No.  What's going to happen in the event of a no-deal is that the EU will require the RoI to establish a hard border to keep the EUCU from breaking down -- she cannot reasonably do otherwise.  The UK will treat that as a violation of the GFA, and will void the GFA, terminating the RoI's route to acquire NI.  This is why the UK has been playing the ""maybe there's a magical technical fix to the border"" game and saying ""I'm fine with not imposing a border going into the UK...of course, it's up to the EU as to the other direction"" -- because it knows perfectly well that the RoI is going to be wedged into that position once the UK and the EUCU become disconnected at a customs level.

The RoI lost her chance at NI when the UK chose to Brexit and thereby effectively determined that the RoI and UK were not going to be in one country together.  Once that happened, the UK wasn't going to turn over NI.  That referendum happened years back.  It's over and done with, barring some at-this-point extremely-unlikely path where the UK somehow remains in the EU.

&gt;That doesn't mean that NI become part of the ROI, maybe thaty became a independent state. 

*rolls eyes*

&gt; And a fun fact, if Scottland became independent it seems there will also some form of border in the Irish sea.

Also not happening (well, not any time soon).  The UK will not have another referendum for decades at least, if ever.  She did the ""establish a democratic basis for the union"" that had been lacking in Scotland.

&gt; The UK government want a unilateral exit clause of the WA for the WA itself.

Yup.  Because when they exercise that exit clause, it will force the RoI to impose a hard border, which will result in RoI actions that they will consider a GFA violation, which will let the UK void the GFA.

&gt;You fall for the stupid claim of some hardcore Brexiters

I don't think that I've seen any Brexiters say this.

&gt; that the intention of the ROI is to rob NI from the UK

What, are you *joking*?  Of *course* the RoI would like to acquire NI.  Why do you think the RoI valued the GFA?  Because it created a route for them to acquire NI.

The RoI wanting NI isn't some sort of hidden secret.  The RoI and UK have been spatting over NI since Irish independence.  Let's not be disingenuous here.",üá∫üá∏ United States of America,/r/europe/comments/cx9jjz/brexit_what_we_should_learn_from_this/eyplpm4/,vokegaf,1567303791

&gt;TIL Russia invaded itself.

Chechnya isn't Russia. It got invaded in the 19th century by Russia, got destroyed and people got genocided by Stalin, and it declared its indepence before the dissolution of the USSR. Then of course it got invaded and now controlled by Russia and its warlord. Chechnya is Russia even less than Slovenia is Italy and Austria. 

&gt;So spreading terrorism further into Russia is ""just an excuse""? 

I'm not sure what part of the brigade being majority Dagestani and being under Dagestani Jamaat you failed to understand.

Chechnya was actively fighting with those groups as well. And those groups were there thanks to Russia, lol.

You sound different so I will make an attempt to explain.  


&gt;In the sense of 'voting instructions', there are three categories of whip in British politics that are issued on particular business. An expressed instruction on how to vote could constitute a breach of parliamentary privilege, so the party's wishes are indicated unequivocally but indirectly. These whips are issued to MPs in the form of a letter outlining the parliamentary schedule, with a sentence such as ""Your attendance is absolutely essential"" next to each debate in which there will be a vote, underlined one, two or three times according to the severity of the whip:

&gt;* A single-line whip is a guide to what the party's policy would indicate, and notification of when the vote is expected to take place; this is non-binding for attendance or voting.
* A two-line whip, sometimes known as a double-line whip, is an instruction to attend and vote; partially binding for voting according to the party's position, attendance required unless prior permission given by the whip.
* A three-line whip is a strict instruction to attend and vote according to the party's position, breach of which would normally have serious consequences. Permission to not attend may be given by the whip, but a serious reason is needed. Breach of a three-line whip can lead to expulsion from the parliamentary political group in extreme circumstances, and even to expulsion from the party. Consequently, three-line whips are generally only issued on key issues, such as votes of confidence and supply.[citation needed] The nature of three-line whips and the potential punishments for revolt vary among parties and legislatures.  


This is merely a three-line whip.   

The Moscow trials on the other hand:

&gt;The Moscow Trials led to the execution of many of the defendants. They are generally seen as part of Stalin's Great Purge, an attempt to rid the party of current or prior oppositionists, especially but not exclusively Trotskyists, and any leading Bolshevik cadre from the time of the Russian Revolution or earlier, who might even potentially become a figurehead for the growing discontent in the Soviet populace

You sound different so I will make an attempt to explain.

I appreciate that. 

Anyway, on to the main point:
&gt;This is merely a three-line whip.

Perhaps in normal conditions, but with the parliament being prorogued in what is now a transparent attempt to assert control over multiple branches, it's a bit authoritarian. This now shows at least that being for extension has now become a key issue.

&gt;Can you see the difference?

Yes. It was hyperbolic, and while that's how internet posts are, although it's sadly seeped into daily discourse.

'Course, discussion without hyperbole would be nice, but that would require a return to better standards for dialogue, which requires a rebuilding of mutual respect.

Remember the part where you said it was nationalistic, xenophobic hyperbole? I used to think that the opposite was true, that Brexiteers were like that to us.
It may not excuse this some of this sub, including me, but many still remember when we were called a Caliphate, an analogue of the Soviet Union or the Fourth Reich. I'm personally still bitter about that.

Or interventions at all for that matter. countries are eminently capable of tearing themselves apart. Especially when they have weak institutions to begin with. Somalia tore itself apart after a failed invasion of Ethiopia. In Eritrea their totalitarian leader enslaves it's people after a bloody seccessionist war with Ethiopia. In Sudan north sudanese arabs wanted to to rule east african south sudanese. Now the british should never have given in to north sudanese pressure in 1946. But nothing but north sudanes greed prevented an amicable split.

Do not infantilize africans. They are perfectly able to make their own decisions.

But yes, i agree we should not destabilize other countries. For all that Saddam commited numerous massacres, the name Bremer should be held up as the definition of incompetence after how he lead the transitional government in Iraq. And i completely agree the rebels in Syria should never have been supported. Nor the ones Libya. 

But don't for a second pretend that european countries are responsible for all instability. **Every** country is created and shaped by war. European, asian, american or african. Wars you win, wars you lose and wars you are neutral in.

All we can do is make the best of what we have. Their instabillity is not caused by europe. Their instabillity is why europe managed to conquer them in the first place.

To be clear, I also think that Islam is a violent and inherently political ideology, but the same can be said of Judaism and Christianity. It's just that those societies have learned to get rid of some of the more extreme parts. I see no reason why reasonable amounts of at least somewhat qualified Muslims couldn't do the same.

My point boils down to this: I think there's a lot of reactionary viewpoints (sexism, homophobia...) inherent in all Abrahamic religions, including the Christians who hate Muslims despite seemingly agreeing on a lot of things. I just think the outside geopolitical influences I mentioned in my first paragraph can turn a ""normally"" bigoted Muslim from just that to a Jihadist/terrorist.

372,"Text of the Article:

Parliament returns on Tuesday and it is expected that anti no-deal MPs will ‚Äì with John Bercow‚Äôs help ‚Äì quickly seize control of the order paper. They will then try and rush through a bill designed to stop the UK from leaving the EU without a deal. I report in the Sun this morning that Number 10 will treat these votes as they would a confidence vote with anyone who doesn‚Äôt back the government being immediately disqualified from standing for the Tories again. They hope that this will keep some waverers in the government lobby next week.

It would mean that if former Cabinet Ministers such as Philip Hammond voted for the legislation, as they intend to, they would be barred from standing for the party again; ending their time as Tory MPs. It is hard to think of a precedent for so many Tories going from being Cabinet Ministers to being ineligible to stand for the party in a matter of weeks.

This upping of the stakes will certainly have an effect on some Tory MPs. There will be those who are reluctant to end their careers in the party over this issue.

There will undoubtedly be protests over this decision. Boris Johnson will be accused of purging the Tory party of those opposed to no deal. But the tactics are not dissimilar to those used by John Major to get the Maastricht treaty through in 1993 in the face of opposition from Tory Eurosceptics.

This approach is not without risk, though. There is a danger that MPs will still rebel and then decide that they have nothing left to lose; increasing not only the chances of them voting down the government in a no confidence vote but also backing an alternative Prime Minister.",,/r/europe/comments/cy0vaf/tory_mps_who_vote_for_the_brexit_extension/eyp04hi/,casualphilosopher1,1567286705

Nazis, and other ethnic nationalists like them, base their national identity around race. This has the ideological end goal of establishing an ethnostate.

This by itself is already morally irredeemable. Worse yet is that _you can't just ask all the minorities in a country to pack up and leave_ so such ideologies inevitably end in genocide.

Your arguement is leaning on an idealized version of the reality, where everyone perfectly understands each other.

You speak of ‚Äúunderstanding one another‚Äù, but wouldn‚Äôt giving proportionate voice to marginalized groups, improve such understanding?

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I am not saying it‚Äôs impossible to be impartial. I am just saying that this type of law, can  make impartiallity more likely where it matters.

An example from a coutry where the representation of genders in government is more equal, would be Sweden‚Äôs paternity leave law. Women were less likely to be hired, due to possibility of maternity leave. The introduction of paternity leave, both gave men the ability to stay with their newborns and it also made the employers discriminate less, as both genders were eligible for a paid leave.

I honestly do not want some kind of draconian policy that would force us to pick a worse person for a job. Personally, I‚Äôd prefer it to be implemented in form of incentives. But I also feel like women are still overlooked when the best candidate is being looked for. Thus, we are actually NOT getting the best candidate possible.

They signed two trsde agreements in 1939 and 1940. 

Via Wiki:

During both the first period of the 1940 agreement (February 11, 1940 to February 11, 1941) and the second (February 11, 1941 until the Pact was broken), Germany received massive quantities of raw materials, including over:[55][76]
German Neubaufahrzeug production, 1940

    1,600,000 tons of grains
    900,000 tons of oil
    200,000 tons of cotton
    140,000 tons of manganese
    200,000 tons of phosphates
    20,000 tons of chrome ore
    18,000 tons of rubber
    100,000 tons of soybeans
    500,000 tons of iron ores
    300,000 tons of scrap metal and pig iron
    2,000 kilograms of platinum

Large amounts of crude oil were delivered, with German documents in 1940 already indicating that the Soviets had delivered crude oil at a rate of 150,000 tons a month for five months in 900 German tank cars exclusively reserved for it.

On June 22, 1941, Germany began Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union through the territories that the two countries had previously divided.[25] Despite fears causing the Soviet Union to enter deals with Germany in 1939, that Germany came so close to destroying the Soviet Union was due, in large part, to Soviet actions taken from 1939 to 1941.[77] Without Soviet imports, German stocks would have run out in several key products by October 1941, only three and a half months into the invasion.[5] Germany would have already run through their stocks of rubber and grain before the first day of the invasion were it not for Soviet imports. Without Soviet deliveries of these four major items, Germany could barely have attacked the Soviet Union, let alone come close to victory, even with more intense rationing.[78] At the time of the invasion, the L√ºtzow was still not yet complete enough for sea travel, but four 20.3 cm turrets had been installed.[79] The Soviets used her as a floating gun battery against German invaders.

598,"I honestly always wondered why is it that Sudetengermans were always the most vocal among all the expelled Germans in German politics even though they have the least right to complain (compared to the other expelled Germans) since they were the only German group in Central Europe that lived in a free democratic country in the 1930s and used this to overwhelmingly (80-90%) vote for Nazi-affiliated party. Those guys were more ethusiastic about Hitler than Germans in Germany.

As for the Czech-Germans relations - we have centuries and centuries of experience with co-existence with German state entities, so we just kinda got used to live besides you, also we have no ambition to play some kind of middle power in Europe (as opposed to Poland), so there are no tensions stemming from that. Middle powers are okay with having confrontations, small countries will throw a stink only when you step at their sensitive spots.

And yes, there are just fewer anti-German feelings among the general population here compared to Poland. WW2 itself is less of a formative moment in our national psych√©.

&gt;Such armor was made to order by renowned armorers, and, **as a rule, had decals and decorations**, even if we are talking about combat, not ceremonial armor, and its cost converted by the above mentioned method was in the range of $100,000 to $250,000.

If we decide to take this as gospel then:

1. The entire range of $100,000 - $250,000 covers the top quality armor, not just the 250k figure. A piece like that may have been a part of a 250k set, or a 100k set, we can't tell. 

2. The article specifically says that that $100,000 - $250,000 is for armor with decorations. If you want to estimate the price of a single piece without decorations, you should subtract from $100,000 - $250,000 however much you think the engravings on the whole suit might cost.    

3. The article doesn't say anything of how much does a single chest piece cost in relation to the full suit. Maybe we can make some un-scientific guesses by comparing the costs of a cuirass on sale on that website to the price of the whole suit: [600](https://armstreet.com/store/armor/western-plate-cuirass-9-segments-breastplate-the-kings-guard) to [3,739](https://armstreet.com/store/armor/medieval-western-knights-armor-kit-the-kings-guard) which is a whole lot less than 40%, though no doubt if we looked at more sets we'd get different figures.",,/r/europe/comments/cxtxbd/armour_of_a_polish_hussar_xvii_century/eynzbp3/,Tasty_Y,1567265823

The government wants to negotiate a deal and be done with Brexit. And to get more leverage on the EU, it also wants to option of threatening to leave without a deal.

The problem is that parliament neither approves of the deal negotiated by the government, nor do they favor threatening to leave without a deal to gain leverage, making it an empty bluff by the government.

Therefore, the only option is to postpone the exit date yet again and repeat the cycle.

859,"True that. Either the artisans are dead or dying out.

Take this one for instance, from back home in India: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidriware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidriware)

Currently, there are less than 5 expert craftsmen engaged in this, and around 300 people in total working in the field, including all assistants and acquaintances.

A small piece crafted in this art like a keychain or something would fetch around 100$ in the open market. An ornament may cost more depending on the size and what not. A bigger piece like a hookah or a pot would cost close to 2000$ (buying directly from the national agency in India that hosts these craftsmen) and would easily sell for $5000-10k (judging from the appraisal I casually got from an art agent here in Europe) depending on the design and craftsmanship. A very large piece like a table or some shit like that would easily cost $200k and sell for a lot more elsewhere outside of India. The value for these pieces comes from the craftsmanship and the rarity of these pieces in the open market.

An expert craftsman working on a piece earns on average $500 monthly, an apprentice even less. Now you can see the problem why this type of detailed art is fading out. All of the value of the piece gets siphoned through agents and middlemen. Not to mention, most people in India don't even know about this kind of art (or any art for that matter).

Frankly, in Europe, from what I've seen, the welfare state has done a lot leading to the preservation of the arts.",,/r/europe/comments/cxtxbd/armour_of_a_polish_hussar_xvii_century/eynjnon/,LaysAnatomy,1567250159

861,"&gt;When Israel kidnapped and murdered Eichmann, it was totally okay.

I wasn't alive during the Eichmann process, but I don't believe that Mossad kidnapping him out of Argentine was morally and legally correct either. My same gripe applies, Israeli authorities should have worked with German and UN authorities to extradite him, if they believe that Israel has a special claim on prosecuting Eichmann as a criminal. Kidnapping and making a show-trial out of it, to gain some national sense of revenge out of it, doesn't sit well with me. 

&gt;When the US bombed Afghan into ashes to find one guy, it was totally okay. ...

I also was too young during the US invasion of Afghanistan, but not only is this a completely different case with its own set of problems, I am, you guessed it, also against it now. The US extralegally, against UN-mandate, went and invaded a sovereign country on shaky evidence. Why do you think I am fine with that?

&gt;But when the russians kill one terrorist, everyone goes mad.

I would get mad about all these cases, I don't know why you strawman me. It's especially funny because the Russian government is the one that claims to respect national sovereignity of other countries and regularly criticizes the US for not doing so. Which is somethign I would agree with! But then they turn around and invade Georgia, invade Ukraine, meddle in foreign elections, finance extremists and radicals, meddle in Syria and kill British and German citizens in acts of vigilantism.

Sorry, but this is complete nonsense. The only reason why UK politicians are every three days in Berlin is that they are wrongfully obsessed with the idea that Germany run the EU. 
The only point is that Germany is the biggest country in the EU.

To be fair it is in the human nature to concentrate thinking on things wich are familiar and more in the view of sight.
Hence people are looking on short term effects.

&gt; I don't know what that means. I don't think that they wake up in the morning and say ""eh, I've got a perfectly-reasonable fix, but I just can't be bothered"" and pad off to watch the television.

Ok, maybe I can make my point clearer.
The Brexit is a radical change and the biggest upheaval for the UK since WWII.
Independent from the question if it makes sense, it carries the high risk that the UK will break apart over this.
This risk steems not from extern source, aka that the ROI seduces NI to leave the UK. It comes from the point that after the Brexit the people could still live together.
To get this you have to make shure, as a politician, that you find a way of Brexit which works for the majority of people. Even if you have to work with your political opponents for this.
But for the actual political class in the UK that isn't the case. Everybody looks only on his own small voter base.",,/r/europe/comments/cx9jjz/brexit_what_we_should_learn_from_this/eyndb0d/,McManix,1567242577

1094,"&gt;Mankind lived undred thousand of year without poluting.

Before 1800 the world population was under 1 billion and the life expectancy was 30 years. If you are willing to go back centuries years in time, technology wise, say bye bye to a heated house in winter, bye bye to vaccinations or antibiotics. It will become normal again for half of your children to die before the age of 5 because of pneumonia or measles.

Before gas and electricity, people heated their houses on and cooked with wood. Burning wood, even though CO2 neutral, causes [air pollution](https://woodsmokepollution.org/).

[7 million](https://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2014/air-pollution/en/) people die of air pollution. Half of that is caused by outdoor air pollution (to which fossil fuels contribute), the other half by indoor air pollution. Most of those are in low or middle income countries (the countries that have the lowest CO2 emissions per capita), because they burn wood indoors to cook on.

Now back to nuclear power. The only disaster in the production of nuclear power for consumers ever that caused more than 10 people to die was Chernobyl (not talking about weapons or accidents with weapons). Chernobyl's death toll is estimated by the UN and the WHO to be around 4000. Over the 60 years nuclear power has been used, that's about 70 deaths per year. Meanwhile, every 4.5 seconds someone dies from air pollution. That's a Chernobyl every 5 hours.

Chernobyl was the worst nuclear disaster that can happen with a civilian power plant. Everything that could go wrong, went wrong. With modern nuclear plants such a disaster is not even possible:

* Modern plants (like western plants at the time already did) have a containment structure of several meters of reinforced concrete (70% steel, 30% concrete) that survives the impact of a plane crash. An explosion in the reactor would not be able to blow the roof of like it did in Chernobyl.

* No-one would build a reactor anymore in which the reactivity increases as the reactor heats up.

* Control rods were stupidly designed in Chernobyl.

That this stuff all happened in the first place was due to poor safety culture in the USSR.

Furthermore, the nuclear sector is one of the most tightly regulated sectors in the world, like aviation. Everytime an accident happens, people learn from this to prevent it in the future, so that it becomes safer and safer. E.g. in Fukushima, a hydrogen explosion happened. Now plant operators install Passive Autocatalytic Hydrogen Recombiners, which recombine hydrogen with oxygen back into water before an explosion can happen.

Aviation is the safest form of transportation, because the sector learns from every plane crash, still, people are more scared of flying than of driving a car, which kills thousands of times as many people. It's the same with nuclear power, it is the [safest way to generate electricity](https://www.nextbigfuture.com/2011/03/deaths-per-twh-by-energy-source.html), statistically safer than solar energy or hydroelectric power, but somehow people are still scared of it.",,/r/europe/comments/cwxwqt/france_is_still_cleaning_up_marie_curies_nuclear/eyn98jp/,collegiaal25,1567237282

At the same time to incentivise economic growth it forced Greece to make new businesses pay the tax of the next year because what else spells economic growth better than making new businesses pay 70%+ tax.

And i'm not an EU hater, i understand if fucked Greece to stabilise the zone even the IMF head said so.

1292,"&gt; The non-use of a brake does not seem to have had any negative influence on it.

I mean, *I* wouldn't be upset about having intra-EU immigration -- I'd say that it's unquestionably advantageous to the UK, and that people objecting to it are not acting in line with the UK's interests.  But that's not my point -- whether it's advantageous or not, people often object to immigration, and according to polling, that played a considerable role in the vote.

&gt; Why do you think that Merkel has such big influence?

She was the last one negotiating with Cameron prior to the election. Yeah, I'm sure that she didn't have an entirely-free hand.

&gt; Is it surprising? The knowledge that the EU has a political part, that the EU beside the bureaucracy has also a political nature is only just developing.

Well, what I meant was things that deal with small-scale issues at home, not that that politics at the EU level were even interesting -- I mean, even that is incredibly short-term.  I mean, you wouldn't decide to join or leave the EU because you think that a current politician is terrible (well, within certain sane limits, I suppose) or great.

Like, when Blair or Cameron or some guy in the Foreign Office is sitting down to decide ""should the UK be in the EU"", they aren't going to be primarily thinking ""How annoying are bendy banana regulations?"" or ""Will the EU spend some of the funds she receives from the UK on roadway maintenance in Wales?"".  Those just aren't all that important, and at any rate, both are terribly short-term -- what's happening today there likely has very little useful predictive power about what will be happening in eighty years.  But that was what was in written about in the media.

If I'm thinking about EU membership's benefits to the UK, I'm thinking of things that I'd expect to be relevant for quite some decades:

* Will it eliminate military threats?  Will it create military threats?  Will it make my country more-or-less defensible?

* How will it affect my leverage over time, both with the country that I am leaving and with other countries?

* How will it affect the cost of trade with other countries?

* Will it gain/lose access to important resources or transport routes?

&gt; It's clear neither May nor Johnson or even Corbyn shows the will to find a solution which works for most of the people.

1325,"Ach Berlin. Was ist Berlin? Berlin ist die Stadt f√ºr die man sich als Deutscher auf internationaler B√ºhne sch√§men muss. Wenn man Berlin mit anderen europ√§ischen Hauptst√§dten wie London, Paris, Madrid und Amsterdam vergleicht, treibt es jedem anst√§ndigen Menschen die Schamesr√∂te ins Gesicht. Selbst kleine L√§nder wie √ñsterreich, Belgien oder die Schweiz haben mit Wien, Br√ºssel und Z√ºrich international vorzeigbare St√§dte mit hoher Lebensqualit√§t. Deutschland ist gestraft mit Berlin, der Hauptstadt der Versager. Berlin beheimatet mit Abstand am meisten Arschl√∂cher in der gesamten Republik. Deutsche Bahn, Bundestag, Air Berlin und der Axel Springer Verlag sind nur einige Beispiele f√ºr den unf√§higen Abschaum der hier beherbergt wird. Glorreiche Zeit sind schon l√§ngst vorbei, diese Stadt liegt am Boden. Der Berliner an sich ist durch und durch ein fauler Lump. Charaktereigenschaften die in jedem zivilisierten Kulturkreis als pure Faulheit, Unfreundlichkeit, Unf√§higkeit, dissoziale Pers√∂nlichkeitsst√∂rung und Dummheit gelten, erkl√§rt der Berliner kurzerhand zur Berliner Wesensart. Ein weiteres zentrales Merkmal ist der alles beherrschende Minderwertigkeitskomplex. Deswegen projiziert der Berliner auf jeden der in irgendeiner Weise besser ist als er, massive Hassgef√ºhle. Besonders die ihm in allen Belangen haushoch √ºberlegenen S√ºddeutschen sind ihm ein Dorn im Auge. Er neidet ihnen den Erfolg und M√ºnchen steht ganz oben auf seiner Hassliste. Diese Stadt ist alles und hat alles was der Berliner gerne w√§re und h√§tte. Das M√ºnchen dem Berliner sein Lotterleben finanziert, interessiert den Berliner nicht, er glaubt sogar insgeheim er h√§tte es verdient. Anstatt sich aus seiner aus Neid und Missgunst entstehenden Lethargie zu befreien und seine Stadt umzukrempeln, ergeht er sich in asozialen Schmarotzertum und h√§lt noch gro√üe St√ºcke auf seine vermeintliche Weltstadt. Kulturell ist Berliner eher schwach veranlagt, gro√üe Werke liegen lang zur√ºck. Auch gilt hier bereits das Aussprechen des Buchstaben ""g"" als ""j"" als gro√üe Kulturleistung. Fortgeschrittene beherrschen sogar das Anh√§ngen eines ""wa?"" an den Ende eines jeden Satzes. Das Leistungsniveau in der K√ºche bewegt sich auf √ºberschaubarem Niveau. Eine Wurst aus gemahlenem Seperatorenfleisch mit Ketchup und Currygew√ºrz wird hier als Currywurst und als kulinarischer Geniestreich verkauft. Jeder vern√ºnftig denkende Mensch h√§lt eine Wurst mit Ketchup wohl kaum f√ºr den heiligen Gral der K√ºchenkunst und wahrscheinlich noch nicht einmal f√ºr ein Rezept. Gro√üz√ºgig l√§sst der Rest der Republik den Berliner in diesem Glauben um seine Minderwertigkeitskomplexe nicht √ºberhand nehmen zu lassen. Wirtschaftlich ist Berlin ein einziges Desaster, selbst die sp√§te DDR stand solider da. Ansonsten fu√üt die Berliner Wirtschaft auf alternativen Blogs, irgendwas mit Medien und Genderstudies wenn man den Universit√§ten glauben darf. Ungeachtet des wirtschaftlichen Bankrottes leistet sich der Berliner trotzdem Prestigeprojekte wie das Stadtschloss und einen Flughafen der mangels Funktionst√ºchtigkeit als Kunstprojekt gelten soll. Ebenso beherbergt diese Stadt s√§mtliche Zentralen der Volksparteien, die aus Marketinggr√ºnden auf das ""Verr√§ter"" im Namen verzichten. B√ºrgermeister dieser Stadt war lange der lustige Wowib√§r der mit seiner Prestige&amp;Prosecco Politik alles in den Abgrund riss, was noch halbwegs pr√§sentabel war. Kurzum: Berlin ist der Fliesentisch Deutschlands. Es ist das f√ºr Deutschland, was Griechenland f√ºr die Europ√§ische Union ist und h√§tte Berlin eine offene Kloake, w√§re es das Rum√§nien Deutschlands. Berlin ist ein Schandfleck, der Pickel am Arsche Deutschlands. Berlin ist der Typ der ohne Einladung auf deine Party kommt, noch nicht mal Alkohol mitbringt und auch nicht versteht dass er nicht erw√ºnscht ist wenn man ihm ein paar Z√§hne aus dem Gesicht klopft und die Treppe runterwirft. Berlin ist das Detroit Deutschlands und geh√∂rt f√ºr 200 Zloty an Polen verkauft.",,/r/europe/comments/cxjqde/britons_make_worst_tourists_say_britons_and/eymn9ix/,Kharaaz,1567214060

 What will happen to Russia after Putin?

This technology doesn‚Äôt fucking exist. Please, prove me wrong. Go ahead. Currently the entire solution to the backstop is the ‚Äútechnology‚Äù and ‚Äúalternative arrangements‚Äù. 

People started talking about this in November when May signed off the deal. It‚Äôs been 10 months and I‚Äôve still not heard a single person elaborate on their backstop alternative apart from scrap the back stop and those two quotes verbatim. 

That doesn‚Äôt even touch the main problem: why do you need to remove the backstop if you have the solution right in front of you? The backstop is insurance. If you have a solution ready, the backstop will never be activated. It‚Äôs a back up in case alternative arrangements are not possible. 

So what‚Äôs the big concern? If you have the solution right there in front of you, and you are so committed to an open border in Ireland, what‚Äôs wrong with the backstop? Why are you wasting so much time arguing over something, by your own admission, is effectively a non-issue since it will never come into place?

Oh yeah, it‚Äôs because the alternative arrangements and technology are bullshit, there is no solution, you just want to ditch the backstop and keep the rest of the deal as is, then fuck over Ireland. You want your cake and eat it. But the EU will obviously listen to Ireland before the U.K.  and Ireland will not back down on this because **IT COULD NOT BE CLEARER THAT WE ARE TRYING TO FUCK OVER IRELAND AND BE A DICKHEAD ON THE WORLD STAGE.

You said it‚Äôs about balancing our economy so we can export more. But that requires investment. We have a devalued pound, and rock bottom investment. Both due to uncertainty. So we aren‚Äôt exporting more, and we are paying more for imports. Especially so since we don‚Äôt have much natural resources so we have to import (at higher costs) to manufacture to then export. And this doesn‚Äôt factor in impending tariffs that will wipe out the savings from a devalued pound for foreign consumers. So how exactly does this help? Germany isn‚Äôt devaluing the Euro to wipe out benefits via export tariffs. Your argument doesn‚Äôt work. 

&gt;	But let‚Äôs be honest, they move where labour costs are low and they are offered incentives to stay.

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHA
Mate have you seen the difference in wages between Eastern Europe and say Germany or the U.K.? You seriously think they move where the labour costs are lower? And incentives to stay? Well those are illegal so nope, that‚Äôs not the case either. 

Believe or not, and try not to be blow away here, they actually go where it makes the best financial sense. And sometimes that means going to a place with thigh labour costs because they are very skilled and good at what they do. And tariffs suddenly mean that the cost/benefit arguments need to be re-evaluated. But you couldn‚Äôt be more wrong about that. Like not even close to correct. 



And we can‚Äôt compete at the higher end or the lower end? You realise we have an awful lot of very high end tech going on in this country and we can compete? We just compete on services and scientific innovation rather than the manufacturing.

The main reason France scores so high on oil imports is because of *Total S.A.*, so what *EDF* gains in electricity sales is likely coming out of Total's revenues.

The other thing is that not everyone can afford to charge the car during the night. Commuters need their cars in the morning or in the evening, and it's a reasonable assumption that this is when most of the charging gets done. 

Now I didn't run the math for France, but for Germany: If half of the current German car fleet is replaced with electric cars and a mere 10% of all those cars want to charge at once, they require more than double the current ad hoc capacity of the entire German grid.",Charlemagnia - personally vouching for /u/-ah,/r/europe/comments/cxd4mn/how_dependent_are_eu_countries_on_oil_imports/eym4xvz/,ColourFox,1567199579

1542,"Why would that ""raise economic hopes""?

(1) Greece is still dependent on the market for their interest rate and the quantity of money. Would they use bank loan contracts, the market has no say about the interest, because bank loan contracts are not tradable securities, unlike bonds. 

(2) Greece does not create the money they need for fiscal spending out of nothing, like for example Kublai Khan. Greece is weak compared to the Yuan Dynasty.

(2) Greece is subordinate to the EU. The EU tells Greece and all other EU member states how much to deficit spend. And that amount is 3% of GDP max. So, it doesn't matter that rates are low, because interest rates on government bonds are not a central driver of the economy. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Fiscal_Compact

(3) Greece is subordinate to the IMF. In their ""letter of intent"", the IMF tells Greece what to do. This is undemocratic legalised financial blackmail. Unelected bureaucrats rather than representatives of Greece choose Greece's faith. https://www.imf.org/external/np/loi/2011/grc/113011.pdf 

(4) Greece is subordinate to the ECB. According to Article 107 of the Maastricht treaty, it is forbidden for anyone, including elected officials to subordinate or give instructions to the ECB.

(5) There are no Credit Guidance instructions given to reflate the Greek economy.

(6) The Greek banking sector index is still down the drain.

(7) There is a brain drain happening. https://www.ft.com/content/24866436-9f9f-11e8-85da-eeb7a9ce36e4

(8) Youth unemployment in Greece is 39.9% (OECD stat). https://data.oecd.org/unemp/youth-unemployment-rate.htm

(9) GDP per capita is $18,600, down more than $13,000 from the peak of $32,000 in 2008.

Conclusion: the hope is unfounded. There is ONLY hope once Greece breaks free from the EU, the ECB, the IMF, their own national bank, the BIS, and all these other predatory institutions.",,/r/europe/comments/cxd5r2/greeces_borrowing_costs_hit_new_record_low/eym4zcx/,retardedbutlovesdogs,1567199608

That was the only thing that changed in these thousands of years of human history.

&gt; After 45 years there were wars, but they were waged in such a way as to avoid heavy losses, and any conflict was resolved in advance. 

Well, they were waged in a way to not touch powers with nukes, because that would be just the end of human species, and most of other mammal species too. As for other powers, it's no problem. Whole of Korea was bombed harder than Dresden.

&gt; If nuclear weapons were a significant factor, then the USSR would not break up

There are ten times as many people who speak Nahuatl (the main Aztec language) as speak Navajo. More people speak Southern Quechua (the largest Incan language) than Danish. And Navajo is one of the largest native american languages outside of Latin America. Or looking outside North America, the very Catholic Philippines, also converted by the Spanish, never had Spanish or English anywhere close to displacing Tagalog under either Spanish or English colonial rule.

Heck, during the 16th and 17th centuries Classical Nahuatl was one of the official languages of New Spain, with plenty of literary works, Catholic religious works (although not the liturgy itself), etc. published in it. Its really only in the 18th and 19th centuries that it goes into rapid decline due to centralization and hispanicization by first Spain and later Mexico (with Mexico's efforts being much more effective than Spain's due to having much more ability to exert its wills than a distant colonial overlord like Spain). And there are still many more Nahuatl speakers than there are speakers of any native language in the US or Canada. Quechua similarly was learned and used alongside Spanish by Spanish colonial officials and Catholic missionaries during the first two centuries of colonial rule before being cast aside due to increased centralization tendencies in the late colonial and independence period.

The actual linguistic demography of Native American languages doesn't really bear out that Catholicism kills minority languages. Centralization, state enforced homogenization, and (in the case of empires) Europe's increasing sense of it complete and utter cultural superiority over the rest of the world in the 18th and settler colonialism kill languages.

1691,"The point was more to illustrate that Marvel's Thor is not really much to do with Norse mythological Thor beyond inspiration. It's a magic warrior king guy with a hammer, lightning powers, and some shared names. That's about it really.

&gt; Are you going to say casting a blonde blue eyed, narrow nosed German to play a blonde, blue eyed, narrow nosed Swedish character is the same as casting a black sub-Saharan with a broad nose, big lips and Afro?

I mean literally nobody had mentioned race until now but sure, whatever. If Marvel wants to do a female and/or black Thor, cool. I thought Idris Elba was great as Heimdall. Mixed black/mesoamerican Tessa Thompson fit in the films just great as well. It didn't matter that they looked nothing like you would expect their Norse inspirations to look like because Marvel is not trying to recreate Norse mythology. If some big company *was* trying to do something true to the myths then yeah, I'd expect more appropriate casting - Thor should be white, male, ginger, and either played by a Scandinavian or by someone who can convincingly do one of the accents. 

Again, if you're unhappy with Marvel Thor *looking* non-Scandinavian (even ignoring how much Hemsworth's Marvel Thor doesn't look like Norse Thor) why is it okay for him to *sound* so thoroughly non-Scandinavian? 

&gt; How does it feel to be so woke that you take joy in the usurpation and destruction of your own kind and that you'd resort to the most asinine justifications for it?

Okay, whole bunch of issues here: first of all, *nobody's* kind is ""Marvel comic hero"". Second, I'm not Scandinavian, I'm Scottish. Our myths get very little representation in anything mainstream ever. The three biggest films about our history starred an Australian in a ridiculous anachronism stew of clothing, an Irishman, and an American.  Third, if you *were* to do something as loosely based on our myths as Marvel's Thor is on the Norse then no, I don't give a damn how you do it.

Yes ukraine can get gas through NS 2, russia technically cant stop Germany from providing gas to ukraine but that is only assuming russia will provide enough gas through NS 2 that will be enough for ukraine needs which is honestly ulikely, since they are pretty clear with their intentions for ukraine.

1723,"""Vulture"". Poland acted this way to stress out its right to self-determination and will to defend western borders. Munich agreement was a collapse of post Versailles order, and proof that western allies are ready to change eastern borders of Germany just to prevent war. Poland also did not want to be considered second class country, that rights are less worthy than German of any great power. It was a mistake, because it painted us as Hitler's collaborators, but it really wasn't some kind of ""expansionism"" just for the sake of having more land. This couple towns didn't make us more powerful or so.

Negotiate over Danzig? With Hitler? Impossible. There was no such advices btw

Defending on big rivers would mean losing half of our industry. Also our leaders were afraid that after annexing Pomorze, Wielkopolska and ≈ölƒÖsk Hitler would stop and try negotiate peace with western allies.

BEF started crossing the channel 3rd September, and ended 27th. I don't know which date you are referring to. Polish Army never capitulated as a whole.  But that's true that any possiblity of effective defence collapsed with Soviet attack 17 Sep and all big formations capitulated about 26 Sep. I don't exactly get your point with this one. French army was fully able to start offensive war around 12 Sep, they decided not to. It wouldn't change the outcome of battle of Poland though.

Of course it wasn't impossible. And nobody was expecting that western allies would start the new world war to help Poland. Some people were expecting that world war would start basically automatically because of the crucial differences between two sides, possibly with Soviet attack.

The comparison between Germans killed by Polish army and Jews killed at hands of Polish collaborators or that some Poles were complicit in their deaths is nonsensical. First of all we don't know to how many Jewish deaths was caused in some way by Polish people, also the goal of the war is not to kill your enemy, the goal is to rule him out of warfare. Should Poles kill more Germans just to look better in such useless comparisons? Polish 1st armed division that took part in fights in Normandy and Netherlands took captive according to some source 50 thousands Germans soldiers, should they kill all of them?

I also think the cultural factor is complex, it could also work the other way around: if you live in a prosperous society that offers you opportunities you'll tend to be more relaxed and cooperative, if you live in a struggling society you'll be more in survival mode and just care for you and your family. So maybe more freedom means more abuse in the short term but more opportunities and hence a healthier work culture in the long term. Also free markets are driven by competition, if a company doesn't care enough about keeping its employees happy it will struggle and fail. Too much regulation makes life harder for new entrants and helps to keep unproductive companies alive, it kills competition and worker mobility.

It would be a bit complicated to explain all its uses but essentially because the second little is being addressed by the first one (or the other way around - I'm not great at grammar even in English) you have to lenite it - this changes the spelling from ""beag"" to ""bheag"" and changes the pronunciation from beck to veck (in Gaelic  g's sound like hard c's and bh is sounded like a v). So the whole things sounds out beck a veck phonetically.

Too add a fun fact this is where the name Hamish comes from. In Gaelic Seamus is a very popular name, if you are referring to Seamus you lenite the begining and slenderise (adding an i) to the end making it Sheumais. We don't pronounce s when next to h in gealic - so the name changes in pronunciation to just Heumais - which has been anglosized to Hamish.

&gt;31 Aug 1939 	Adolf Hitler offered the United Kingdom that Germany would not risk war if Poland was willing to turn over Danzig and a small section of the Polish Corridor, and that Poland was to allow a plebiscite for the remainder of the Polish Corridor in the near future; British Ambassador in Germany Nevile Henderson expressed that the United Kingdom, while desiring peace, could not sacrifice Poland to achieve that goal. Meanwhile, **Henderson continued to press Poland to send a delegation to Germany** in a last attempt to negotiate peace over Danzig and the Polish Corridor. When Polish Ambassador in Germany J√≥zef Lipski attempted to send Henderson's message to Poland later in the evening, he found that Germany had cut telephone and telegraph communications to Poland.

1938,"&gt;Frankly, I quite like that part. You're not supposed to toy around with the constitution at or just for convenience. And if you change it, there shouldn't be any question as to the legitimacy of the will to do so. Requiring two thirds of both chambers may seem harsh, but it does the job very well in my opinion.

I thought you might, and that seems a fairly common position in Germany. The point is that the UK approach is different, but also seems to work while allowing for flexibility and evolutionary change that can be quite rapid and fundamental (in positive ways). The use of legally driven shifts (I'm thinking the German constitutional court and LGBT rights but I'm sure there are other examples) is also more a German (and US..) thing than a UK one for example.

&gt;Besides other things, its spares Germans the gruelling experience the UK currently goes through. Which is not because of Brexit as such, but because of the way it came to pass: Basically on a 50/50 split of the general population, with the mood of the day tipping the scale.

Oddly I'd argue that Brexit is a fairly decent example of the UK system working rather than an indication of dysfunction as such. It's messy, noisy and annoying, but it's hard to argue that in the face of a lack of consent to EU membership, that Parliament hasn't had to act, while at the same time no-one has been able to push anything through without massive scrutiny.",United Kingdom - Personally vouched for by /u/colourfox,/r/europe/comments/cxdpml/suspending_parliament_why_it_couldnt_happen_in/eykx886/,-ah,1567170709
1939,"&gt; If you electrolyse water with 100 joules of electricity, how many joules of electricity can you get from the obtained hydrogen? (with current technology)

This is a dangerous way of thinking because it leads to people taking the money instead of improving their health, environment and that of future generations

&gt; If you store 1 litre of hydrogen for a month, and transport it across europe, is there significant loss?

Why would you though?  It can be extracted more locally than oil and gas and needs far less processing.  Not to mention companies have been doing just that for a long time now.

&gt; Does the whole production/storage/transport produce significant waste?

Not really because the storage is reusable as are the production methods and because it's easier to extract than oil and gas, again it can be done locally so transport isn't as much of an issue

&gt; Does Hydrogen leakage have any adverse effect on the environment? (to my knowledge, it very bad for the ozone layer)

*In January 2002 Milan Bandiƒá (mayor of Zagreb) was stopped by Kre≈°imir Mi≈°iƒá, a police officer, and accused of drunk driving. Bandiƒá's attempt to bribe the officer was unsuccessful, and he then threatened the officer through his (alleged) connections with the Ministry of Internal Affairs in Croatia. His threats failed, and Mi≈°iƒá turned him in. When the media later found out about the incident and criticized Bandiƒá, Mi≈°iƒá was fired for leaking information to the press. Under political pressure, Bandiƒá resigned.\[18\]\[46\]\[47\] A police investigation revealed that Mi≈°iƒá had 92 open cases when he was fired, so he was subjected to a disciplinary process for neglecting work. Bandiƒá later helped him return to the force, becoming godfather to Mi≈°iƒá's daughter. (c) Wikipedia.*

&gt; ""Import dependency on oil is calculated as the ratio of net oil imports (oil imports minus oil exports) to gross inland energy consumption of crude oil and petroleum products plus fuel supplied to international maritime bunkers).""


This graph only shows oil-based energy consumption (transport, industry...), without absolute values, so it makes no difference between France where electricity production uses almost no oil, and another country without nuclear power. 


While i understand this representation to show dependency to oil importations (the point of the graph), i find it lacks nuances between countries for estimating the consequences of a sudden oil shortage or the effort to stop using oil quickly.

2063,"&gt;That's FPTP. 

I used to be deeply critical of FPTP and  I still am to a degree but this is actually a feature rather than a bug.

The two main left/right parties *need* to incorporate popular views of the further left/right or they risk getting replaced entirely because there can only really be 2 parties. This produces a kind of filtration and moderation effect where the more centre parties are the ones to enact potentially disruptive of controversial legislation and that adds a kind of stability to proceedings. They'll tend to temper the harsh parts - people complain about BoJo but would they rather have Farage?

Consider if we had a proper PR system like in Germany. If an election were held we'd probably end up with a Tory/BXP coalition but under FPTP we'd maybe just have a larger Tory majority.

The two party system is objectively less representative of people's votes in terms of the parties that get into power but it generally creates more moderate and centrist governance.

I'm not saying I love it but there's no perfect system here, it's all trade-offs. Again, Germany is learning that to some degree with Afd who now just hover around 15% or whatever of parliament. In the UK we have no such radical right party in parliament.",Scotland (Anglo-froggish),/r/europe/comments/cx6jbg/47_of_brits_think_suspending_parliament_is_not/eykprpr/,Whoscapes,1567163890

It is up to Parliament. They've had years to vote on it, and can cancel their ongoing recess, but have chosen to whinge because they're losing five days out of the hundreds they've already had. 

&gt; You know fair and well that this is not what this tool was made for.

It is helpful for Boris, yes. And honestly, it's a good thing for Parliament because it forces them to get their act together whilst not taking away all their sitting days - they still have time to vote and reject the EU Withdrawal Act, amend the exit date, or whatever. 

But it's not the only reason he's calling a Queen's Speech. This is the longest session for 300 years, and an incoming PM is expecting to call a speech, and the timing is excellent for conference season anyway. Boris has good justifications, and multiple benefits, but that doesn't mean it's illegitimate or anti-democratic.

2123,"&gt;No. It's about economic growth.

It's entirely relevant. ""Economic growth"" is practically meaningless unless you can point out what it actually translates to. 

&gt;  It's about economic growth. And 0.3% is absolute crap but apparently for France that's pretty good.

Yeah, maybe the economists pointing out how it's good know something you don't. Germany, France, Britain and Italy are among the top 10 economies in the world. Growth can mean something entirely different to them. 

0.3% growth is from a **much larger** base than that of most countries with higher growth. Those decimals represents *enormous* sums. When a western-European country grows 1%, each percent means something entirely different than that of a much poorer's country percent. 0,3 increase from a billion is a way larger number than 3% growth from 10 million. GDP per capita at purchasing power parity is quite relevant. 
You do know how percentages represent, right? Indonesia is an emerging developed middle-income country, yet its GDP per capita PPP is medium at 13 120$, which is still *less than half* that of France. How is that supposed to be irrelevant exactly?

Similarly, China has a GDP growth of 6,2%. Sounds Amazing, right? It's also one of the biggest economies, so that must be good?  That actually represents a *dangerous stagnation and decline for China.* China is actually really nervous about it, and you better believe we're in for some interesting stuff as China's retirement wave starts accelerating. Weird, huh? It's almost like these numbers are highly relative.

&gt;The reality is that European countries are stagnating in relation to Anglophone countries

You literally just snidely bragged about how fucked Britain supposedly is. *The second largest Anglophone country.*

&gt;the developed Asian economies

That term again. Neatly dodged Singapore, huh? Your argument doesn't look so good when a country's GDP growth shrinks from **14,5%** in 2010 to **3,2%** last year, and shrinking. That's quite a lot for less than a decade. Oh, what about South-Korea? It surely must prove your argument, right? 3,1% in 2018! Fantastic!

That's not an argument, that's just restating your position. 

&gt; all the main political parties gave their word to uphold the vote

That's not the point. The point is that many people voted with the knowledge that the government might say what it wants but the fact was that the referendum was not legally binding. I know people who either voted Leave as a protest vote or didn't bother to vote Remain because they expected that the result wouldn't matter.

&gt; i forgot about the greek referendum, yes i remember thinking what a bastion of democracy greece had become, from the birthplace of democracy too, the irony. and asking the irish to vote again after rejecting the lisbon treaty was totally undemocratic.

The Greeks and Irish don't feel that way though, so I'm not sure how your personal opinion makes them undemocratic. Again, I'm not seeing any arguments here.

You can use electrolisis to turn electricity into hydrogen and so if you electricity is low carbon, the hydrogen will be too. For now it's just a more expensive process.

The big idea is to eventually use the surplus electricity that gets produced in a high-renewable grid to make hydrogen. But for that to work out we also need to start work on hydrogen tech today.

It's similar to how battery electric cars might still partically run on coal today.

Sorry but it isn't. And this comes from somebody who thinks that hydrogen/methane made from electricity (so not from natural gas) is the best bet to go 100% renewable.

Electrolysis is 70-80% efficient. Then going back to electricity in fuel cells is in the 40-60% range.

2428,"**Simple majority on independence referendums**

I have had some comments on the past on this.  To rehash the high points from memory.

* I have never found any independence referendum -- and I went digging through a handful -- that has been anything other than simple majority.  That seems like a reasonable standard to conform to.

* To have something other than a simple majority -- say, a two-thirds supermajority to leave the EU -- it seems to me that the same high bar should be met to have *entered* the EU as well.

* On the other hand, in many cases constitutional change has a higher bar than this.  Given that independence -- normally from a country, not the EU -- can have an effect that is arguably at least as great as constitutional change, this seems questionable.

* I personally do think that there is an argument for supermajority votes, but I think that the issues for which that should be applied should be as minimal as possible.  A vote can be thought of as modeling a civil war.  If two thirds of the public want out now and would fight for it and one third want to remain in, having a bar higher than that just means that you have a reason to have a *real* civil war rather than a modeled one.  In the US, the supermajority bar is to modifying the US Constitution, and that is a fairly minimal set of law that deals directly with things that are expected to be minimum for things to function.

* I am somewhat uncomfortable with the idea that people raised this *after* a vote rather than before as an interesting technical problem.  That is, it seems easy for one to advocate for a supermajority to promote a policy that one agrees with.  Theoretically, the ideal should be to *convince* people rather than to fiddle with the bar.

* Federation will also address the specific issue of EU membership referendums in that members won't be able to simply leave.

* Some of what seemed objectionable to me was that the issues on which the Brexit referendum were fought did not seem to map very well to issues that I saw as Leave likely to resolve effectively.  The British leadership and civil service was not generally supportive of leaving.  Britons seemed to me to object to immigration -- a common complaint -- but I do not think that leaving the EU is likely to effectively address those issues; it seems likely to simply raise the proportion of non-EU immigration, which I doubt is actually what they wanted.  Some questionable claims about money and the economic effects were prominent in the debate.  I think that some people resented the expansion of the EEC without their approval -- I mean, whatever the benefits of the EU, it *is* true that the British government had been adopting a policy of ""ask for forgiveness rather than permission"", and while I assume that they planned to ask for approval at some well-timed moment, the time they chose wound up smack dab in the middle of the refugee crisis.  To me, the debate surrounding the issue seems like it might be more-palatable than raising the bar.

* Once the bar is hit where large numbers of people start voting single-issue voting third party in a FPTP system for the purpose of leaving the EU, things are already on fire.  Trying to fiddle with the fine mechanisms beyond that seems unlikely to fix things.

* I personally found the short three-month campaign window to be a bit more-surprising -- in the US, far-less-important Presidential elections run for considerably longer -- but I have to admit that even if it were longer, I'm not sure how viable it is to try to explain why *random collection of experts who favors Remain* holds their position to the general public.

* I was surprised at the extent to which the referendum seemed to be fought over what I'd call comparatively unimportant or short-term domestic political issues -- both for Remain and for Leave.  I don't mean approval/disapproval of Cameron, but over things like ""will EU membership cause the national government to be compelled spend more on domestic service X"" or ""will I be required to conform to some slightly-annoying regulation"".  None of these seem to me to be particularly fundamental to EU membership or even particularly interesting, though I'll concede that perhaps those points play better politically than geopolitics or international economic or military relationships.  Certainly, though, it seemed terribly disconnected from what I'd call any serious benefit of the EU, and thus the arguments are fragile.

* Economic or financial benefits seemed to largely be taken as a matter of faith.  One side had their set of experts, the other the other, and the typical voter on the street had little to recommend one or the other.  Here I wonder if the three months mattered -- I don't think that one can realistically sort out what's true or not in a short window.  Plenty of argumentation and explanation happened *after* the referendum, which it was largely irrelevant (though positions didn't really change much, so maybe that didn't matter anyway).

**EU approval matters**

I sat down and tried to figure out ""what was the last place where something could reasonably have been done differently without a lot of risk and political damage?"" a while back.  I got:

* Blair chose not to use the immigration brake (along with Ireland and Sweden).  This probably lead to a higher level of immigration, and he probably mispredicted political backlash or ability to handle it.  Blair probably would not have been faulted had he used the brake.  After this point, any figure probably would have had to suffer serious political harm or take major risks to greatly-change things.  Cameron could have ignored public opinion (which would have probably lead to serious Conservative losses and UKIP gains; I'd assume that even if the Tories were willing to take that kind of political risk, that they'd expect Labour to split the political damage in some way, and even that sort of arrangement wouldn't work well in a PR system).  Merkel could have extended more concessions, especially restricting immigration (which might have encouraged various organizations that favor internal protectionism in the EU; if French workers think that they can cut others out from competing with them, my guess is that that becomes a risk and integration in general becomes at risk).  May could have tried to play with the referendum result.  None seem very palatable.

* EU approval never greatly outpaced disapproval in the UK for long after Maastricht according to Eurobarometer.  That seems to me like a dangerous situation, and one that could reasonably be guessed at being a dangerous situation.  I don't know who (if anyone) is responsible for dealing with low approval -- the EU itself?  National governments?  Nobody?

    EU approval was low for about twenty years.  That was a long time to do something.  Yeah, maybe nobody could quite predict the refugee crisis, but they *had* to know that any serious crisis could be politically-dangerous.

2429,"[continued from parent]

**The potential terms were not made very clear**

* ""Hard Brexit"" and ""Soft Brexit"" were fuzzy terms that changed in meaning.

* What Leave entailed was not made very clear.  As I've argued on here, having a ""Leave, but only with a deal"" option is not practical, *but* I do think that it would have been possible to establish whether-or-not something like EEA would have been viable from the start -- I saw a number of people on /r/ukpolitics saying that it was clear that EEA was never a realistic option, but not right at the referendum.  I don't think that this was likely clear to a voter.

* The EU has not offered a set of backstopless terms, and if this is to happen, it must happen prior to Halloween.  Either the EU will make such an offer, or it will not.  My view is that it would be irrational for the RoI not to do so, but say it does not.  If it does not, it seems to me that it would have been heavily to RoI benefit to have made as credible a statement as possible explicitly and vocally prior to the referendum that this would be its position.  Hell, even if it makes such an offer prior to Halloween, it would be to its benefit to try to claim as convincingly as possible that it would not do so prior to the referendum.  This was not an issue that I saw seriously discussed until the A50 process was underway (just ""Ireland will be a complicated issue"").

    Speaking more-broadly, I'd say that it is almost certainly an EU interest to avoid having the public of any member to believing that any terms will be offered that are more-favorable than what it will offer is considered viable prior to choosing to leave.

* I personally could not seriously guess at winners or losers until after the referendum.  I didn't know EU tariff schedule contents until after the referendum, nor did I see industry papers put out until after the referendum.  I cannot imagine that the typical Briton was in possession of any source of information that most could consider trustworthy as to who would likely benefit or be worse-off.  That being said, the economics were not considered to be a top issue.

* The British government released an internal report that modeled economic impact, which was more-or-less in line with other predictions (except for the Deutsche Bank one), but that was not released until after-the-fact and after a great show of demanding it.  It seems reasonable to me to believe that this information would have been useful to voters.  I don't know when the actual report was written (might have been after the referendum and so wouldn't have been relevant anyway), but surely if it wasn't, producing one before the referendum could have been of value.

**Overseas voting**

This would not have swung the referendum, but an item that saw some discussion was whether UK citizens living abroad in the EU (who I'd assume would have been more-likely-than-the-general-public to vote Remain) should have been permitted to vote.  That is not really an EU issue *per se*, but it does seem like a fair issue to raise.  True, maybe someone living in Japan or Greece doesn't have quite the same ties to the country, and perhaps they should have less influence.  But especially for Britons living abroad in the EU, it seems like the particular issue of UK EU membership is directly germane to them and that they are full participants in the issue.

The US does not hold federal referendums, but in general, as I recall, US citizens living abroad vote in federal elections as if they resided in their last US state of residence (and somewhat-curiously, due to the federal structure, residents of US territories cannot vote in federal elections), and at least some if not all states permit citizens to vote in elections in their last state of residence as if they were still resident there.  I don't know what the norm for this is at an international level.  There does seem to me some argument that even if I'm living abroad, that changes that will fundamentally alter what my citizenship means -- and even more-directly, my rights in the country where I am residing and perhaps my right of continued residence or employment there -- are a matter on which I should have a say.

I understand that due to some complicated case history, residents of Gibraltar could vote in the Brexit referendum, though residents of other British Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies could not.  The EU relationship with those exists on a bilateral basis, as I understand it, so it's not totally unreasonable to not vote in the referendum.  Perhaps the only other EU member for which this would be important is France, which has some overseas territories, but it does seem to me to be a point on which there was some disagreement around the referendum.

I would not say that this is a question for Brussels, but it does seem to me a matter worth consideration for members in the EU as to how they handle referendums.",üá∫üá∏ United States of America,/r/europe/comments/cx9jjz/brexit_what_we_should_learn_from_this/eyk49tj/,vokegaf,1567136445

Boris Johnson, like everyone else in parliament agrees that certain kinds of Brexit are unacceptable and not worth voting for, regardless of the referendum. We know this because they voted against a Brexit proposal put before them and agreed with the rest of the EU.

The question is whether a may withdrawal agreement brexit is not acceptable, but leaving without finalising any of the details of trade is, the majority of the house disagrees with the second proposition.

The most obvious rational approach is for Boris to clear out everyone from his party not committed to his strategy, and hold an election with only loyalists in it, while each other party puts forward their own strategy.

2488,"UN military forces are drawn from UN member states and controlled by the UN Security Council, which is pretty much the ruling body of the UN as all UN Member states are obliged to obey the decisions of the council. The UN Security Council consists of the 5 countries who were the largest contributors to the Allied victory in WW2 (the US, UK, France, Russia and China). Each of these 5 countries has the right to veto any resolution that is brought before the council. So, in simple terms that means that in order to send UN troops to Ukraine, you'd need need to get approval from Russia. And that is unlikely to happen because Russia has no interest in putting an end to the war in Ukraine.

The sad truth is that no one really has a way to do anything about Ukraine. Ukraine itself is mired in corruption, poverty and internal division. Russia doesn't want to put a stop to it. Belarus wants to help but its mediation efforts so far have failed and it is afraid to upset its ally Russia. The UN is controlled by Russia. The EU is internally divided, doesn't want to upset Russia and its most wealthy and powerful member states have no real interest in Ukraine. The US would like to do something, if only to spite its rival Russia, but it is limited in what it can do without provoking a Russian retaliation.

2504,"&gt;The European commission is unelected, the president is unelected.

The European Parliament (which is chosen by the people directly) and the Council with the heads of state (which are chosen directly in some democratic countries, **unlike your own**) elect the Commission. With Parliament having the final say, meaning that they are in the most powerful position.

So 1. the European Commission *is* elected 2. they are elected by the people that *you* either directly or indirectly elect. 

Let me ask you something, did you vote for Boris Johnson directly?

See. The EU and the UK are not so different at all! :)

&gt;Many other things are imposed on the countries... 

Imposed? When a party you dislike in the British Parliament makes laws you disagree with, do they also 'impose' those on you? You are part of the democratic system of the EU, but just like in your own Parliament, you can't always have it the way you personally want. 

That doesn't mean the EU is authoritarian, it just means that sometimes you don't get what you want, because more people want something else. That's democracy.

&gt;AND it is ilundovratic in the UK because they voted FOR Brexit

Right, and I agree that the UK should leave. But how does the UK voting for Brexit mean the EU is authoritarian? **The EU can't force you to stay,** they can't make the UK leave either. The EU has zero power in that.

The UK is still in the EU because the British Parliament is incompetent, not because the EU is authoritarian. Want to leave? Then leave. The UK could've left years ago.

---

Let me just make a small note that it was the UK that has an 'unelected' PM ask *a queen* to *suspend Parliament.*

If you want to (incorrectly) name the EU undemocratic, go ahead, but then also call your own government undemocratic because 1. it has the same system 2. it's literally suspending the democratic process for a few weeks, so according to your own rating system, the UK is even worse dare I say.",Nazi Netherlands,/r/europe/comments/cwptff/save_our_democracy_stop_the_coup_everywhere_in/eyjsomm/,CreeperCooper,1567127198

Georgian officials have refused to have any talks about placement of police checkpoints on Georgian controlled territory.

AFAIK they couldnt, they would have to actually change UK law (Referendum Act) to do so.

2679,"&gt;  I think it would benefit all European countries

I understand you do. But it is evidence you barely know some European countries. 

There's countries like Slovakia, whose reality lies within Europe. Slovakia's identity is fully European, its foreign relations with non-European countries is relatively weak and mostly determined by European context. Its geopolitics is confined to Europe. There's little reason not to be part of a federal Europe. 

There's countries like France, whose reality lies also to a large extent outside Europe. France itself is multi-continental via its dependencies, but more importantly much of its identity and potential lies in Africa. It has a strong foreign policy and geopolitical ambitions. But furthermore France is strong enough to determine European foreign policy to a large extent. France and Germany being the to main drivers of Europe's geopolitics. So a Federation is a good tradeoff. 

There's countries like Portugal, whose reality also lies to a large extent outside Europe. With rather strong and wide foreign policy, and geopolitical ambitions much larger than its size. However unlike France, Portugal doesn't have a voice within Europe strong enough to impose any of its interests. This means being part of a Federal Europe would mean giving up its geopolitical ambitions, its foreign policy, and to a large extent its identity. 

You may not understand this. But as I said, that's just profound ignorance. Let me try to give you some pointers to show how this point. 


Here is a recommended book [The Lusophone World: The Evolution of Portuguese National Narratives (Portuguese-Speaking World: Its History, Politics &amp; Culture) 
](https://www.amazon.com/Lusophone-World-Portuguese-Narratives-Portuguese-Speaking/dp/184519859X). Relatively recent, born out of a PhD thesis on the subject, so rather serious material. If you happen to read it sometime do meditate on how much of that you knew or didn't know. 

Here is a video of the [5th Ministerial Conference of China and Portuguese Speaking Countries](https://youtu.be/TNQJ9zCwEf8). Were you aware that this is the main platform connecting China and Portugal? Did you know China is [promoting Portuguese in Macau](https://24.sapo.pt/noticias/internacional/artigo/governo-chines-quer-macau-a-traduzir-radio-e-televisao-em-portugues_26887342.html). Do you understand the leading role of Portugal in establishing this connection between China and Portuguese Speaking Countries? 

Here is an excerpt by the [Carnegie Endowment for International¬†Peace](https://carnegieendowment.org/2018/10/15/china-s-rise-as-geoeconomic-influencer-four-european-case-studies-pub-77462) on the relationship between China and Portugal. Notice the contextualisation. 

&gt; Portugal, a European country with a long-standing relationship with China due to its own colonial history, notably in Asia, became a key partner of Beijing in Western Europe in 2004 after signing a strategic partnership exactly five years after the handover of its tiny colony of Macau to China. China has always been intrigued with the 220-million Portuguese-speaking community worldwide, and in 1996 studied the creation of the Comunidade dos Pa√≠ses de L√≠ngua Portuguesa, a community based on the shared language of nine countries on four continents.28 It is headquartered in Lisbon. Each year, the Sino-Portuguese Macau Forum takes place in the former colony, sometimes in the presence of the Portuguese prime minister and a Chinese vice premier. The Macau connection has played a crucial role in the continuation of the Sino-Portuguese relationship, primarily through a group of influential politicians and advisers once posted in that former colony.

Note the difference between the standard [German perspective](https://www.dw.com/en/portugal-a-china-friendly-eu-nation-driven-by-need/a-47872582) where Portugal is just a poor rectangle being bought by China, and nothing but that, an influence that should be removed according to German will.

 Did you see how the Bulgarian [Georgieva](https://www.ft.com/content/944d18ce-8588-11e6-a29c-6e7d9515ad15) entered the race to become UN Secretary General, with the support from Berlin. A late nomination into the race, when all candidates had gone through most stages of evaluation. Complete disregard for the rules. An embarrassment for Bulgaria since they already had their own candidate running. And disrespect to Portugal who was well ahead leading the race. Portugal, i.e. Ant√≥nio Guterres, did win. Do you think Portugal would have a UN SG if Europe were a Federation? 

Do you know anything about the freeing of East Timor from Indonesia? Do you know Portugal‚Äôs role? Do you know of [Portugal‚Äôs diplomatic wars with Australia](https://www.icj-cij.org/en/case/84)? Have you seen reports of Portugal‚Äôs peace [keeping operations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4nXsG47Ts4) post independence referendum, with forces independent from those lead by Australia. Have you seen the cables [with the Portuguese accusing Australian forces of intentionally causing trouble for profit](https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/06LISBON1137_a.html). Have you seen how the [East Timorese celebrate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pi_FzabPrmI) Portugal‚Äôs win in the Euro? Did you know all Timorese born until 2000 in Timor have right to Portuguese nationality? Do you know how much or how little Europe supported Portugal in the process of freeing East Timor? How much do you think Portugal would have done in a Federal Europe? 

Do you have any understanding of the [basic principles of Portuguese geopolitics](https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/08LISBON2689_a.html). The explanations in that cable continue to apply. Did you know any of that? Do you understand how it is incompatible with a European Federation?  

Did you know Brazilians residing in Portugal, without Portuguese citizenship, can request equal rights to Portuguese citizens. Meaning in the territory they are treated as Portuguese for the vast majority of purposes. This means Brazilians can even vote for the Portuguese president without having citizenship. In theory they could even become Portuguese ministers or prime-minister without Portuguese nationality. 

Do you know that Portugal is rushing to fast forward [some version of ‚Äúfreedom of movement‚Äù within the CPLP](https://www.tsf.pt/portugal/sociedade/interior/projeto-de-livre-circulacao-na-cplp-deve-ser-aprovado-em-julho-11035440.html) countries, with the [understanding](https://24.sapo.pt/atualidade/artigos/portugal-diz-que-ha-tempo-para-aprovar-mobilidade-na-cplp-mas-nao-todo-o-tempo) that there is a limited window of opportunity, given the sentiments in Europe regarding emigration. How much leeway do you think Portugal would have a say in determining such policies in a Federal Europe? 

And I could go on, and on and on. But this should provide a taste for why it is unthinkable for Portuguese diplomacy to support a Federal Europe. It simple has no support in Portugal, and will continue not to have. And for good reasons. It‚Äôs contrary to its whole geopolitics and identity.",Portugal,/r/europe/comments/cw7lsb/macron_to_ambassadors_if_we_do_not_react_we_will/eyjkpnt/,autoclismo,1567121373

2693,"&gt; I never said EU was supposed to do more, I just said that attributing the positive state of Europe to the efforts of legislators etc can easily be questioned.

Following this logic, when is it ok to give credit to european legislators ?

&gt;Except some member states have inherently less impact on decisions than others. That is why there are many sceptics in small countries like the Czech Republic, where people are sick of being ruled by other nations

This is a demographic and economic reality. Of course larger and richer countries will always exert more influence than smaller and poorer one. You only have to take a quick look at european history to see how those smaller countries were at the mercy of the great powers for the longest time. At least the EU is heavily mitigating that issue, with one vote per country on the Council, one commissioner per country on the Commission, and degressive proportionality to elect the EP.

It's weird that you chose the Czech Republic, since it's actually a great of example of why the EU is such a great system to avoid repeating the past. From the Bohemian Kingdom being ruled from Vienna, to Tchekoslovakia suffering under soviet yoke, without forgetting the Munich Agreement... Yes, Germany still wields considerable influence, but that's just never going to change.

2695,"&gt;If they are completely autonomous (and completely independent of Serb control), and there's freedom of movement, what practical difference does it make? Why is that unacceptable?

It makes the difference of having our flag fly there, maps showing it as hours, them not having their own sports teams, but in larger terms, actually having some control. A lot of autonomy isn't independence, there'd still be matters they'd have to answers to us for.

&gt;For Kosovars, it's not that long ago that Serbia took away their autonomy, and the current president is still someone who was a prominent member of the government that made that decision. Can you really blame them for being mistrusting of Serbian government?

I can't, but you can blame Serbs in Croatia and Bosnia for not wanting anything to do with them after what happened in WWII? You can't, yet we all know how that story ended.

Also, Vuƒçko wasn't in charge in 2008 when the UDI came.

&gt;There are legitimate concerns that should be addressed, such as the appropriate rights and protections for Kosovar Serbs, as well as freedom of movement between the two countries. But provided these things can be agreed on, and everyone can work towards closer European integration and prosperity, wouldn't that be best?

2763,"I think what you have to understand is that from a geopolitical perspective, the US has been incredibly stable. There are really only two areas where the Trump admin has truly diverged from Obama, Trade and Climate Change. Besides that, Trump is just continuing Obama's policy, he is continuing Afghanistan pull out, he is continuing the Pivot to Asia, he has made the US functionally energy independent, and as a result, is slowly removing US efforts to maintain freedom of navigation in the middle east. This gives the US more resources to use in Asia. Now you can argue that these are two immensely important areas, and I'd agree. But functionally speaking, there are no immediate costs to not working on climate change, and therefore no loss in geopolitical capital. So from a pure politics perspective, there are no short-run costs to avoiding working on climate change. As much as I disagree with Trump's policy here, it's ""meh"" in terms of political impact. 

Now as far as trade goes, it has absolutely has changed. But there's also a strong argument to be made that the US has allowed other countries to engage in far higher rates of protectionism with higher Tariffs among other things. A lot of the American establishment viewed the leniency towards trade disadvantage as a political carrot to attract other nations with. But there's a significant contingent who feels that if the rest of the world is engaging in protectionism, then there is no reason for the US not to. Trump was really a representative of this movement, and it was bound to happen eventually. Going forward we're going to see the ratification of FTAs getting more difficult as this non-identified caucus has a lot more power and willingness to combat the ""establishment"" . You can expect an America that today is far more independent than it was in 1990 and has more ability to exercise it's power. So you see these are symptoms of a great fundamental change. What you see as erraticism has really been decades in the making for better or worse.

Trump is absolutely an erratic and has a madman-like personality. But the policy behind all the bluster is actually fairly expected and stable. I think the real surprise is if Clinton was elected(who was SecState under Obama), we'd have seen a somewhat similar policy, the main difference being a US compliance with the Paris Accords, and the US that would not be attacking other countries on trade as much. But then again, as I say, this contingent in the US political sphere has existed, and it is bipartisan, and a figure from this political group was likely to get elected at some point. In a way, Trump just accelerated about a decade of policy into a short term. His immunity to his political opponents because of his base means he has more freedom than most first-term American Presidents.",,/r/europe/comments/cx55ql/macron_advisor_rising_shootings_an_opioid_crisis/eyj70jh/,Deadassskillz,1567113530

It was for most of recent history russian, both territorialy and after 1945 ethnicly as well. Since the founding of the USSR, the Crimean ASSR (as it was known at the time) was part of the Russian SFSR. It just so happend that a certain soviet leader that came to power shortly after Stalin's death was a russian-ukrainian from Kharkov decided to be nice to his home republic within the Union and transfer the peninsula to Ukraine's juristiction. Of course, this didn't exaxtly matter in any way since they were all under direct rule from Moscow, the union itself being highly centralised. However, doing the chaotic collapse of the USSR in 1991, nobody really bothered to undo this act of ""kindness"" if you can call it that, mostly because pf other issues like the russian economy being as close as ever to a dumpster fire. And no, Turkey hasn't regained shit. Let's compare: in 2014, Crimea was about 70% russian
In 1971, Cyprus was barely 20% tukish, with greeks forming an absolute majority. Neither NATO nor the EU bothered with the problem, because of certain strategic interests in Anatolia. The CIA actually knew that an invasion was coming but did not do anything to help the defenceless greeks. But suddenly, when Russia annexes a land with a population overwhelmingly russian, everybody is like ""Yo, you can't do that"". I mean really? Are we really going to apply the principles of self-determination that were the bases of the post - Great War borders and the long process of de-colonisation (heavily supported by America may I remind that) whenever we feel like it?

Salvini seeing that he wasn't going to get his elections backtracked on the vote of no confidence but it was too late as Conte had already basically thrown his dimissions at his face and ripped him a new one in front of the country and the parlament, tried to make up with M5S but was told to fuck off and ended up being relegated to whining about how a PD/M5S government is not ""the will of the people"" at the opposition.

What I was saying was that during the referendum various different kinds of Brexit were all discussed as if they were not all mutually exclusive, with the Leave campaign committing itself to no specific solution. At some point however, if you're going to Brexit, you have to choose a type of Brexit. 

Anyway, I don't know who you mean when you talk of ""the UK"" as a coherent whole, if are not talking about the British government, as led by its PM. Theresa May was very much the author of her own disaster. Right after the referendum most analysts expected the UK to go for the softest type of Brexit. This would have been the rational choice. May opted however to put party over country, pander to the Tory extremists and paint herself into a corner with her ridiculous red lines.

Because no dialect had a critical mass in terms of number of speakers, prestige, etc., they ended up taking vocab from one dialect and grammatical features from another.  The result was an official Irish that no one spoke natively.

The implementation of teaching the language certainly has left something to be desired as well. With so many non-native speakers now teaching Irish, other problems result.  For example, Irish (as well as Scottish Gaelic) has palatalization, meaning that consonants sound different depending on whether they are ‚Äúbroad‚Äù or ‚Äúslender,‚Äù so the words beo (alive) and b√≥ (cow) sound the same except for the way the b‚Äôs are pronounced.  But English doesn‚Äôt have this distinction, so learners can‚Äôt always be understood by natives.  (It would kind of be like an English learner unable to hear the difference between ‚Äúcrab‚Äù and ‚Äúcrap.‚Äù).

- northern renaissance happened simultaneously with french renaissance (end of the XVth century). So saying that France was a backward country while Burgundy was  filthy is extremely biased and inacurate.

If they win the vote of no confidence, they'll very likely be unable to agree on a interim PM and thus Boris gets to call a general election.

Or the opposition loses the vote of no confidence, Boris' position is strengthened and he has free reign to do what ever. He'll likely find a scapegoat for a no deal exit and remain as the PM post-exit with brexit voters flocking to his side.

At this point I don't see how this could play out in favour of the opposition, in the short term at least, brexit might very well destroy the Tories in the end. Even if the opposition manages to get a interim PM and get an extension from the EU(realistically I don't see Corbyn or anyone else push the envelope much further, but I doubt it even matters much) for a general election, Boris will then just rally his supporters behind him by calling it an attack against brexit and ally the brexit party, while the opposition remains fractured.","The top of the Baltic States, as always",/r/europe/comments/cwz9u3/jeremy_corbyn_has_called_on_mps_to_support_a_vote/eyirxql/,NerdPunkFu,1567106718

I'm fully aware of this, but the reality is we held that much territory. The Vance-Owen plan would've seen us give up some 27%. That was too much.

The history of Scotland is really reflected by Scots in a way - Scotland became united under a Gaelic elite, the centre of power moved to the Lowlands, the elites adopted Scots (the Anglic language of the Lowlands) which rose in influence, Gaelic faded away, and Scotland became increasingly linked to England, eventually leading to the Scottish inheritance of the English crown and the rise of the English language over Scots.",New Zealand,/r/europe/comments/cwzadd/status_of_the_celtic_languages_in_the_21st_century/eyi7csf/,banananaise,1567098518

2930,"&gt; I don't see any studies in those links which quantify the percentage of migrants fleeing because of famine and drought.
&gt; &gt; and I doubt anywhere close to 50% of the migrants are literally fleeing from famine and drought.

https://docs.wfp.org/api/documents/WFP-0000022124/download/?_ga=2.85460124.46423775.1540402016-1767178983.1540402016

&gt; There is clearly is a link between food insecurity and emigration from the three countries. Poverty and unemployment are the general causes of emigration, followed by reduced agricultural productivity, adverse climatic events such as droughts, pests that result in crop losses and the widespread occurrence of violence. The high rates of food insecurity found in the households that participated in this study demonstrate the linkages between emigration and food insecurity. Nearly half (47 percent) of the families interviewed during this study were food insecure (38 percent were moderately food insecure and 9 percent were severely food insecure). These levels of food insecurity have not been previously seen in the region, including in the results of various assessments over the past three years that focused on drought and the effects of El Ni√±o in the Dry Corridor.

Mabye you should look a little harder then.

&gt; Most of those links were just opinion pieces about the situation.

They are not opinion pieces. They are first hand reports on what is happening in that region. What you're writing is an opinion, and not a very well informed or argumentative solid one.

&gt;  Most Central American illegal immigrants migrate for economic opportunities, and I doubt anywhere close to 50% of the migrants are literally fleeing from famine and drought.

So, do you have a source for that study to make that claim, or did you just pulled it out of thin air? Also, a nice way to belittle the problem at hand, as mass migration very rarely has one single  factor it comes down to. But this was also written in one of those articles.

&gt; ‚ÄúMigration stories are always complex,‚Äù Sutter says. ‚ÄúIt's not untrue that violence is driving people out; it‚Äôs not untrue that poverty is driving people out. But it is also true that climate change and severe drought are causing people to move from Central America, and from other [regions]. And I think that we have to look at that in a clear-eyed way and think about what that means.‚Äù

2993,"The article seems quite disingenuous and even silly at times.

&gt; Arcueil Mayor Christian M√©tairie.

The article should have mentioned that the mayor is a ""federal councillor"" of the French Green Party (*Europe √âcologie Les Verts*). A party well-known for its anti-nuclear commitment. 

M√©tairie is obviously using the interesting case of Curie's laboratory as a prop in his political agenda.

&gt; There are traces of a uranium isotope at the Curie annex with a half-life of 4.5 billion years. ‚ÄúFrance‚Äôs nuclear industry is like a plane that took off without a landing strip,‚Äù says Yannick Rousselet, a Greenpeace campaign leader.

Yeah, that's where the whole scheme of using Curie to put the whole French current nuclear industry on trial is in plain sight.

&gt; A 1997 study concluded that pedestrians and ¬≠residents of apartments just a few feet from the perimeter wall aren‚Äôt at risk of radiation poisoning, but officials say the place remains a hazard.

Why a hazard ? The article does not say. But French sources show that, according to the [mayor's own words](http://www.leparisien.fr/val-de-marne-94/la-depollution-du-laboratoire-curie-reportee-en-2018-10-10-2013-3211545.php) : ""the danger is not the radiactivity itself because the radiation levels, even indoors, are low. But a fire could spread dangerous substances"".

I guess that clears it up, better than the vague and ominous ""still dangerous"".

&gt; ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre proof that France has a serious nuclear waste problem,‚Äù says Arcueil Mayor Christian M√©tairie. ‚ÄúOur situation raises questions about whether the country is really equipped to handle it.‚Äù

Curie's laboratory seems to be more of an odd legacy of the very fisrt steps of radioactivity research rather than a metaphor for today's whole French nuclear industry. And huge amounts of well-identified nuclear waste are paradoxically proving easier to deal with than a few unknown subtances stored in an old Parisian garden.",,/r/europe/comments/cwxwqt/france_is_still_cleaning_up_marie_curies_nuclear/eyi9q3p/,fellowsparrows,1567099451

There was nothing in the slightest resembling a de-facto border between eastern bosnia and serbia in the 90s.

3022,"&gt;the territory of Kosovo was part of the Ottoman Empire longer than it was part of the Serbian kingdom or empire.

Yes, so what? They took it from us and we got it back.

&gt;When the Serbs annexed Kosovo in 1912 from the Ottomans, they basically used a 1000 year old claim on a piece of territory that changed demographics centuries prior to majority Albanian. Talk about irredentism.

450 year old claim which was perfectly valid as it was the Ottomans that took it from us, and we it took back from them. That's how the division during the Balkan wars was done, based on who owned what before the Turks. That's also why there was such conflict over Macedonia, as all three allied powers held it at some point.

And demographically it only changed maybe 50 years prior to 1912, and even then it wasn't a massive Albanian majority like now. Not to mention there were barely any Albanians there before the Ottomans took it.

Irish was never fully dead, but had been relegated to being spoken by the poor so there was a social stigma surrounding it. And English already existed as a common language, which was also the main global language, unlike Yiddish. Irish also had no importance to Catholicism, while Hebrew is intrinsically linked with Judaism.

Just saying the Irish are lazy is very facile for these reasons. But at this point Irish should be spoken much more commonly as it is, and some responsibility must be taken for that, not just only complaining about the English attempt to destroy the language. That happened but it is in the past and must be moved beyond.

Of course the EU wants to keep 'Business as usual'.  It is cheaper and more efficient.  

It's not an act of charity on the EU's part to just keep doing things the way they are done now.  The EU has been saying they are going to sic their attack lawyers on the UK and that is a lie.  Inertia and efficiency indicates everyone wants as little trouble from this as possible, and Boris is calling the bluff.  

Of course the EU doesn't want to change things, and the UK does.  This is what happens when there is built-in imbalance.  The people with advantage want a status quo, that benefits them.  They will then threaten dire consequences, but in the end they'll just have to accept a less-beneficial position.

Following your logic, when will we invade Vatican city to forcibly redistribute the wealth stolen from the poor? Actually, if we go back further every nation's government started out as a tiny warlord somewhere, so really we should disband all nations as all of them are build on the fruit of the labour of others. 

See how nonsensical that argument is? When the UK became a constitutional monarchy the power was handed over peacefully in return for the retention of the royal family as part of the UK government/head of state.

3234,"&gt;Yeah, and this being acceptable is WITHOUT PRECEDENT. It wasn't okay then, it isn't okay now. So the only thing that is precedented is that it's not been acceptable, even when it last happened....26 years ago.

That's a rather different argument though isn't it.

&gt;Brexit is automatic unless revoked. 

Yes, because Parliament legislated for it in that way, and hasn't managed to find a majority to change it.

&gt;This prevents an organised revocation.

No,it doesn't. It doesn't prevent a revocation (a lack of a majority does, revocation wasn't even slightly likely prorogation or not), it doesn't prevent legislation to force an extension, it doesn't prevent a VONC. It creates a new avenue for MP's to oppose it (the motion that accompanies the Queens Speech) and the possibility for Parliament to vote down the Queens Speech.

&gt;As such, it pushes Brexit through. 

And that's exactly what it doesn't do. It would have if it had been over the period from now until the 31st, it could have if it had started later and covered the period in the run up to the 31st. As it it is reduces the number of sitting Parliamentary days from 24 or so to 19, it still leaves enough time for any of the options that people have been talking about, assuming a majority can be formed around it.

&gt;I'm going to assume you aren't stupid, but this is beyond obvious unless you purposely try to obfuscate.

I'm not, but I get the impression that you have a slightly flawed overview of the situation, which given some of the reporting is not surprising.

3342,"&gt; we have several times and it's going fucking nowhere

So the discussion is not going as you like, so let's suspend parliament longer to mostly prevent it. So much democracy...

&gt;can't remember full details

So you don't even know what you are talking about.

&gt;well democratically we voted to leave

So if the majority voted leave, then why be so afraid it is all going the be blocked? Maybe the majority voted leave but with a deal, that the Brexit politicians can't deliver on. So maybe check in with the electorate if this gigantic change is really what they want.

&gt;well yes they gave us the extension because without it we leave on no deal which isn't great for us but it hurts the EU too, especially as with a deal they get their divorce bill or even better, we stay and everyone sees how hard it is to leave os they don't bother

It's amazing how you twist the extension the UK asked for as something bad the EU has somehow done to you. And we are seeing how hard it is to leave, since the UK has no clue on how to proceed and now grasps to things like then just suspend parliament to prevent it doing its job.

&gt;you haven't voted right so vote again. if we do a second ref and remain wins should it be best out of 5? fucks sake.

God forbid people change their minds after a few years in which it became clear all the talk of an easy Brexit with a quick trade deal was not going to happen. I really don't get this argument at all. So you think there should also be no elections, because nobody every changes the way they vote? Might as well leave the old party in power forever then. This is not about voting the right way, it is about giving people a say in a massive decision that shapes their future now they have more information about how it is going down.

Government bills can be carried over to a new session (I think by a motion in parliament). One such bill is the one ending free movement in to the UK for EU (etc .) citizens, something the government has promised to do on the 1st of November.

It might be a relief to government if it IS delayed as they're nowhere near ready administratively or legally to do this.

&gt; There are a lot of MP's that want a deal with the EU before no-deal. It's near impossible to get any major steps done in two weeks.

Yes - except maybe for a vote of no confidence, which requires only a vote in the commons (not multiple votes, committee stages, votes on the lords, etc, as for legislation). Then there would be almost certainly be an election.

This may be what the prime minister is expecting to happen.

&gt; The EU and May had agreed on a deal, parliament can either agree on that deal or face no-deal (or, but this won't happen, stop Brexit).

Another option is to have an election and get a new parliament. This might change what can be passed. If the conservatives get a majority without the help of the DUP, for example, they'd have more chance of passing the deal. It's not obvious that the prime minister would want to pass it, though (although it's possible he wants to be forced in to reluctantly passing it).

3494,"&gt; The Brits want to control their borders, to make sure immigrants are stopped from entering... but also don't want a border with the EU?

The UK government has said they will allow EU citizens to enter the UK for 90 day visits. Also, it's very unlikely there'll be immigration control at the Irish border (there isn't now, unlike with the rest of the EU, and Irish citizens will retain their right to live and work in the UK without a visa).

For these reasons almost all immigration control aimed at EU citizens will happen away from the border, via employers, banks, landlords, etc.

When it comes to the Irish border it's the movement of goods that's the big issue. That's why the backstop was meant to help - it allows freer movement of goods whilst not applying at all to people. It's still a contradiction to want no border and the other stated aim of 'an independent trade policy', however.

Even without a border it'll inflame things in NI. Right now, people can go about their business there, including going back and forth across the border, with very little contact with the British state, at least the central one. This seems to have reduced the affront to people regarding themselves as Irish by enough to avoid them killing each other so routinely (but there's still a lot of anger and hatred). A customs border, even without border posts, etc, means filing customs forms and paying the British government for permission to move goods around within the island.

Now when the truth is out people wonder if it‚Äôs ‚Äòsafe‚Äô to buy a fossil fuel car, mainly worrying about raised taxes. 

So they wait a bit longer buying a new car. The car they are currently using is working fine. 

Adding to this is raised traffic tolls in Sweden big cities. It not unusual for people to pay ‚Ç¨80 √° month per car. If you have to cars in the family you pay around ‚Ç¨2000/year in extra tax.

3626,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_strategic_bombing_during_World_War_I

&gt; The best-known German strategic bombing campaign during World War I was the campaign against Britain, although strategic bombing raids were carried out or attempted on other fronts. The main campaign against Britain started in January 1915 using airships. From then until the end of World War I the German Navy and Army *Luftstreitkr√§fte* mounted over 50 bombing raids on the United Kingdom. These were generally referred to as ""Zeppelin raids"": although both Zeppelin and Sch√ºtte-Lanz airships were used, the Zeppelin company was much better known and was responsible for producing the majority of the airships used.

[Helium Act of 1925](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium_Act_of_1925):

&gt;Sec 4.  That hereafter no helium gas shall be exported from the United States, or from its possessions, until after application for such exportation has been made to the Secretary of the Interior and permission for said exportation has been obtained from the President of the United States, on the joint recommendation of the Secretary of War, the Secretary of the Navy, and the Secretary of the Interior.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amerikabomber

&gt; The *Amerikabomber* (English: America bomber) project was an initiative of the German *Reichsluftfahrtministerium* to obtain a long-range strategic bomber for the *Luftwaffe* that would be capable of striking the United States from Germany, a round-trip distance of about 11,600 km (7,200 mi). The concept was raised as early as 1938, but advanced, cogent plans for such a long-range strategic bomber design did not begin to appear in Reichsmarschall Hermann G√∂ring's offices until early 1942.

-

&gt; On 8 July 1938, barely two years after the death of Germany's main strategic bombing advocate, Generalleutnant Walter Wever, and eight months after the Reich Air Ministry awarded the contract for the design of the Heinkel He 177, Germany's only operational heavy bomber during the war years, the Luftwaffe's commander-in-chief Hermann G√∂ring gave a speech saying, ""I completely lack the bombers capable of round-trip flights to New York with a 4.5-tonne bomb load. I would be extremely happy to possess such a bomber, which would at last stuff the mouth of arrogance across the sea.""

We have hired a lot more staff, have tripled the level of overtime we need and are waiting on brexit to finally be delivered before we start the investment on opening a new factory (very exciting for us). We have a site located near Manchester and have to just sign everything over.

We are waiting for brexit because we will only be opening a new one should we actually leave, in anticipation of the pound remaining weak for quite awhile. Should brexit be cancelled we will use that investment money elsewhere and keep our current production levels, because we anticipate a suddenly reversal of brexit and commitment to the EU will trigger a climb back in the value of the pound quite substantially and rapidly, making increased production levels unnecessary.

For me it's a moral position totally independent from the objective results. For example, a parent is good to his child because he genuinely loves him. Not because it's its interest, nor for recognition. Some of those genuine good actions can either have objectively good are bad results.

When however someone does something in the purpose to foster his own interests, then it is not a good action. But it can have objectively good or bad results.

There is probably a gray area where you are genuinely happy to do something for someone but can't help being satisfied of yourself or happy of the recognition you get.

&gt; Venezuelans, who once enjoyed South America's most prosperous economy, are feeling the effects of food shortages and a crippled economy.
&gt;
&gt; A study released Wednesday found that Venezuelans had lost an average of 11 kilograms, or 24 pounds, in body weight last year, and 90 percent of them live under poverty‚Äîup from 48 percent in 2014 and 82 percent in 2016. The three Venezuelan universities that published the report revealed that 60 percent of the people surveyed said they had woken up hungry in the past three months because they didn't have money to purchase food. Nearly a quarter of the population was eating two or fewer meals per day, the study reported.
&gt;
&gt; Venezuelans have lost more weight compared to 2016, when they reported a loss of about 18 pounds, according to the annual study. For this year's survey, a dozen researchers surveyed 6,168 Venezuelans between the ages of 20 and 65. Roughly 30 million people call Venezuela home.

3746,"&gt; We're talking about abolishing the monarchy and relinquishing their assets, which are cultural heritage sites of the British people.

This isn't exactly the case, though. Unless I drastically misunderstand the financial structure of the Crown Estate, it comprises property that the monarch owns in their own person and the expenses of the monarchy are actually paid out of the Crown Estate--essentially, the Queen lives off of the revenue of the Crown Estate, much of which is her personal property rather than a public good. I believe that there is already a distinction in UK law between property that is owned by the monarchy *ex officio* and by the monarch as a personal holding. In a common law system like the UK, the most logical outcome of the abolition of the monarchy would be that those assets *ex officio* of the monarchy would revert to public ownership but that the personal assets of the monarch would remain private.",Paris 10eme | US Expat,/r/europe/comments/cwlbgz/queen_accepts_request_to_suspend_parliament/eyf27d2/,Gwenavere,1567042345

I don't think it's a stretch to say that peoples' opinions may have changed since that time.

Because this meant the Court had no jurisdiction over the case, it could not issue the writ that Marbury had requested.**

Basically, ""nah, we can't do that. Because our powers give us the right to define what isn't constitutional, we find that it isn't constitutional that Congress can tell us what to do.""

To effectively cheat the system like this is frankly outrageous to me and I feel does nothing but damage our position. I'm very disappointed in certain figures whom I admire so vocally supporting this, especially Rees-Mogg, who, despite all of his flaws to some, has always seemed to be an ardent defender and acolyte of proper parliamentary procedure and behaviour. While what is being done is legal, it's incredibly underhand and that's just not what I stand for!

However, I expect that a Vote of No Confidence will be imminent. And I cannot see how Boris will win it with this new position.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/cwlbgz/queen_accepts_request_to_suspend_parliament/eyejjpj/,AllRedLine,1567034669
3858,"He's very convincing when he talks, he seems like someone who really thinks what he sayd and understands normal people while most other politicians look like they're acting when they talk and they always talk about principles and other ideal, abstract stuff while Salvini talks about everyday situations. Another big factor is a very clever use of social networks (like M5S) while most other politicians aren't as ""modern""

As for immigration specificallt, other parties usually tend to avoid talking about the problems related to immigration and only talk about the positives while Salvini talks about possible solutions for the problems related to it. I disagree with him obviously but that's the reason why he's so popular

Something Salvini could say for example is

""Just 10% (or whatever) of the total immigrants are fleeing from wars, the rest are escaping from no war and they don't have any right to get into Italy. Immigration must be regulated. We don't have any jobs for italians either, if we take lots of immigrants they won't have any job, they will become criminals, they will be exploited and won't pay any tax because they're illegals while at the same time making salaries become lower even for italians because of their ""competition"". The solution is to improve the living conditions where they live because the right not to have to emigrate is more important than the right to immigrate in other countries. What about the victims of the earthquakes that happened in central Italy years ago, what about poor italian people who live in poverty? We have the money to pay for migrants but we don't have them for poor italian people etc etc""

It doesn't sound racist, fascist or whatever at first, it sounds somewhat logical, so it's hard to argue with him. The usual counter argument by left parties is something like

""We need to help migrants, we need to keep the ports open, Salvini is a racist""

They don't really address what Salvini is talking about. One counter argument could be that helping migrants doesn't mean that you can't help italians at the same time. On top of all this you add ignorance, brainwashed people who think that migrants are the problem of everything, people that directly associate migrants with invaders, criminals, assassins, people who cheer when ships with migrants on them sink and so on

One thing traditional parties should have done in past years imo would have been to address the problems related to immigration instead of acting as if they didn't exist and let extremist parties become more and more popular, instead they kept ignoring those problems and calling other people ignorants and it looked like left parties weeren't even realizing what was happening even though extremist parties were clearly becoming more and more popular.

3916,"The Queen's Speech normally happens every year, and sets out the legislation the government intends to pass in that time. However, because of Brexit, the last one was in 2017. 

Boris becoming PM means he gets to do a new Queen's Speech, and is enacting the procedures to do so. This is normal and expected for an incoming PM, whether it's just after an election or not. Because of the timing though, it means Parliament will be closed for 5-20 days shortly before the EU negotiation deadlines. 

MPs opposed to Brexit and/or no deal are angry about this, as it scuppers their plans to delay/cancel/modify Brexit. 

On the other hand, Parliament is away on a five week recess at the moment, and returns on Sept. 3. If they actually cared about the lost debate days, they'd cancel it or come back early. Since they aren't, it's proof of that they're just whipping up outrage for political points. Speaking of an emergency recall, that's the prerogative of the Speaker, who normally does it on the advice of the government, but doesn't have to. 

From a more neutral standpoint, Parliament has had a long time to do this. They've rejected May's deal multiple times, as well as all other options. Extra debate days will do nothing, since they won't be able to decide on anything. Most people are now fed up with this. 

As an aside, Boris is flying to Brussels between the Queen's Speech and the vote on it for last minute negotiations, and Parliament will get to vote on anything he negotiates there.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/cwlnbq/do_not_prorogue_the_uk_parliament_petition_hits/eydykbq/,Candayence,1567026414

3927,"&gt;The wage increase has nothing to do with Brexit and is to do with other domestic policies such as National Living Wage which have driven the average up. Other things like employment are following exactly the same trend as pre-Brexit currently. These things are likely to change if we crash out with no deal and the people who are hardest hit will be the poorest in society.

[I doubt peoples wages rose by 3.9% in 3 months, fastest rise ever, simply because some people earning min wage got a raise](https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/aug/13/uk-wages-rise-at-fastest-rate-for-a-decade-despite-brexit-risks). maybe both played a part, but since less europeans want to come here which shrinks the labour market and thus gives workers more negotiating power due to being less disposable, I'd say brexit is the bigger contributer to this


&gt;Freedom of movement provides a net benefit to the UK economically and that's not even counting the practical benefits of free movement. When people moan about freedom of movement they always over-look that there were numerous additional controls which the government simply chose never to implement which is a domestic issue rather than an EU issue.


agreed that it is better for the economy, but things being better for the economy is different from being better for the individual. as I said an increased workforce makes workers cheaper, so FoM improves our economy by allowing employers to have cheaper workers which contributes to income inequality being too high


&gt;Yeah, some people are going to be hit really hard by the withdrawl of EU money and amongst those people will be some of the least privileged areas of the UK. I've not really heard many Remainer's citing those grants as a reason to Remain though and indeed the areas which receive most of those grants largely voted to leave in a hilarious display of voting against their own interests. A perfect example as to how Leave's lies and scapegoating of the EU played into people's prejudices instead of common sense.


but the way EU handles fishing and FoM have lead to people having their wages cut in half, so say contruction workers especially and fishermen are fucked. also I don't get how you can turn a blind eye to people who get EU grants sticking up for the EU

Then why go on a five-week recess? Why fail to decide on anything over the past three years? Why act shocked about a highly predictable prorogue that was probably going to happen anyway since its conference season?

Actually, no. The procedures being used mean that isn't an issue. It's a prorogue for a Queen's Speech and State Opening of Parliament, it can't be enacted so often. 

&gt; government doesn‚Äôt like parliament having a vote

Not as bad as it sounds either. The government derives its power from the Commons, avoiding a vote generally means that they can only slightly delay Parliament backtracking.

4061,"Well, they'll also increase demand, which drives up wages.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lump_of_labour_fallacy

&gt; In economics, the lump of labour fallacy is the misconception that there is a fixed amount of work‚Äîa lump of labour‚Äîto be done within an economy which can be distributed to create more or fewer jobs. It was considered a fallacy in 1891 by economist David Frederick Schloss, who held that the amount of work is not fixed.[1]
&gt;
&gt; The term originated to rebut the idea that reducing the number of hours employees are allowed to labour during the working day would lead to a reduction in unemployment. The term is also commonly used to describe the belief that increasing labour productivity, immigration, or automation causes an increase in unemployment. Whereas some argue immigrants displace a country's workers, others believe this to be a fallacy by arguing that the number of jobs in the economy is not fixed and that immigration increases the size of the economy, thus creating more jobs.[2][3] 

In an area where immigrants have a disproportionately-highly-represented skillset, they will tend to drive down wages, and in areas where they have a disproportionately-underrepresented skillset, they'll tend to drive them up.

My impression is that when it comes to immigration the general public tend to disproportionately-heavily weight the risks of downwards pressure on their personal wages to the benefits of upwards pressure.

Might be due to [loss aversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_aversion):

&gt; In cognitive psychology and decision theory, *loss aversion* refers to people's tendency to prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains: it is better to not lose $5 than to find $5. The principle is very prominent in the domain of economics. What distinguishes loss aversion from risk aversion is that the utility of a monetary payoff depends on what was previously experienced or was expected to happen. Some studies have suggested that losses are twice as powerful, psychologically, as gains.[1] Loss aversion was first identified by Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman.[2]

It might also be due to the fact that the economics of job loss/wage decline due to competition is a simpler economic concept than that of job generation/wage increase.  [As Nobel laureate economist Milton Friedman put it in this 1970s talk that I rather like linking to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0pl_FXt0eM):

&gt; Now why is the steel industry and similar industries, why are they so effective in their campaigns for protection?  Because of a very common problem that affects not only this but lots of...a lot else, and that is the difference between the visible and the invisible.  The people who are going to lose their jobs in steel are very visible.  They're a collective group.  You can name their names.  Suppose we restrict imports from Japan -- then people are going to lose their jobs in these export industries.  They will be widely spread over the country.  You and I couldn't name one person, but that doesn't mean they're any less real.  But the greater propaganda effect of the steel industry is because, you can see, the visible is a more potent political force than the invisible people who will lose their jobs.",üá∫üá∏ United States of America,/r/europe/comments/cw45b1/eu_says_britain_must_pay_brexit_divorce_bill_even/eydjhga/,vokegaf,1567019725

4143,"&gt; To be honest, EU basically never implements anything, so no measurable improvement can be directly attributed to it. EU merely pulls the strings (directives, laws, grants, ...), while actual work is done by organs of the member states.

Because that's precisely what the EU is supposed to do ? Steer everyone in the right direction.

&gt;I personally find it presumptuous to suggest that EU is responsible for peace in Europe.

Nobody is saying the EU is solely responsible for peace in Europe, but it's just intellectually dishonnest to pretend it's not one of the pillars.

&gt;It is true of all politics that it tries to appropriate all the good stuff and distance itself from all the bad stuff, so why is it so hard to accept that some people are suspicious of any dominant political entity that has power to affect your life in a non-trivial way.

Because the EU is not a clearly independant political entity like the USSR. The EU is nothing else than the some of its parts. Member states wield an insane amount of power in the Union. So if you have to blame someone for something, point the finger at the member states (or the MEP's elected by a member state) who are responsible for the things you are taking issue with (which is perfectly fine) instead of just blaming ""the EU"" or ""the establishment"" like you just did, which really doesn't mean much, and is completly counter productive.",,/r/europe/comments/cw94ct/so_what_has_the_eu_ever_done_for_us/eyd6mws/,papyjako89,1567012228

4173,"&gt; **Member of the European Parliament, 2009‚Äî2017**

&gt; Goulard was first elected Member of the European Parliament in the 2009 elections. Throughout her time in parliament, she served on the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. In 2014, she joined as substitute the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. In that capacity, she served as rapporteur on budgetary surveillance in the Eurozone.

&gt; In addition to her committee assignments, Goulard served as chairwoman of the European Parliament Intergroup on ‚ÄúExtreme Poverty and Human Rights‚Äù.

&gt; On 15 September 2010, Goulard supported the new initiative Spinelli Group, which was founded to reinvigorate the strive for federalisation of the European Union (EU). Other prominent supporters are: Daniel Cohn-Bendit, Guy Verhofstadt, Isabelle Durand as well as Jacques Delors, Joschka Fischer, Andrew Duff and Elmar Brok.

&gt; In November 2016, Goulard officially announced her candidacy for the office of President of the European Parliament;[3] the post eventually went to Antonio Tajani.

&gt; During her time in parliament, Goulard continued to write regularly in a wide range of both French (Le Monde, La Croix, Lib√©ration) and international (S√ºddeutsche Zeitung, Financial Times particularly) newspapers.

&gt; **Minister of the Armed Services, 2017**


&gt; Goulard was appointed by President Emmanuel Macron Minister of the Armed Services on 17 May, in the First Government of Edouard Philippe. In this capacity, she ranked above her immediate predecessor and foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian in the government hierarchy. She was only the second woman to head the ministry, which reverted to its pre-1974 name of Ministry of the Armed Forces.[4] Goulard was replaced by Florence Parly, a former executive and budget official, in the 21 June government reshuffle.[5] She had stepped down after an inquiry over alleged misuse of payments for assistants in the European Parliament[6] was opened on 20 June 2017.[7]
________________________________________________________________________________________
&gt; Goulard, a centrist, strongly supports NATO and the European Union, and holds hawkish views on the regimes of Vladimir Putin and Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan. In 2004, before accession discussions were opened with Turkey, Goulard had taken a position in the debate citing concerns about the eventual enlargement of the European Union to include Turkey by underlining the necessity of preserving the European Union's political ambitions and its capacity to act. She also called for doubts of citizens, facing a European project whose direction they do not properly understand, to be taken seriously.

&gt; Following the 2014 elections, Goulard joined fellow MEPs Othmar Karas, Sven Giegold, Sophie in 't Veld and Alessia Mosca in an open letter aimed at exerting pressure on the President of the European Commission and national government leaders during the nominations process to improve the gender balance in the composition of the European Commission.[10]",Occitania,/r/europe/comments/cwkiiz/france_proposes_sylvie_goulard_as_european/eyd6yxm/,Void_Ling,1567012443

If for example a state parliament passes a law that conflicts with federal law, federal law wins out and the state law doesn't apply.

Example: the federal state Hessen has a constitution which predates the federal constitution. So until a couple years ago (when they truck it) the constitution of Hessen still had the death penalty in it. However the federal constitution outlaws the death penalty.

4248,"It's cute that you try to embiggen yourself and ensmallen the other party as you reply, but let's ignore those parts to shorten time spent.

&gt; TPP was clearly constructed as Obama's version of trade war with China

Trump is not supporting the same approach to economic world order that the US constructed. The last big change occurred in the 90s and this is an attempt at another one, but where the 90s change was a leap in the same general direction, this one aims to either take a turn or make another leap. What will actually happen in the end depends on world dynamics.


&gt; he wants a different deal with Iran because he sees the old deal as not enough, not because the direction is bad.

That's after-the-fact rationalisation. He decided that the Europeans were quicker to set foot in Iran, so he shut the door using means that posed the United States as a different entity than the country tried to pass as in the previous geopolitical era. The US soft power weakened as a result and they now have to use hard power to compensate.

&gt; Weakened control over Europe is a process which started under Bush senior and Obama had also put his quite important part with his pivot to Asia

The focus on Asia did not aim to weaken control over Europe, decision makers in the US know that America needs to maintain influence elsewhere *as it works to contain China*. With Trump, the approach is here again less soft power and more hard power, which may have as a consequence to prompt European countries to become a rival pole, rather than an extension of American control over world order.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; I'm not going to continue this discussion, I suggest you read real geopolitical experts to gain some knowledge and realize I'm right here.

If you have to say that, you should doubt your own certainty. What you have here is time to write posts long enough that you forgot the point: Just because Trump can't turn everything upside down doesn't mean we can say it's a direct continuation. There are clear breaks in policies, it's just that a country can't jump around all over the place.

If you want to see another example of break in foreign policy, look at France in 2007. France in 2017 might be an attempt to a return to former policy, we'll see, but in 2007, the clean break was less radical than the USA in 2016.",,/r/europe/comments/cszgbc/the_end_of_peak_germany_and_the_return_of_france/eycoylw/,_Handsome_Jack,1567004934

4257,"&gt; Yes, there are more Germans than there are Czechs, but not all Germans will want the same thing, and not all Czechs will want the same thing.

Sure thing, but that does not mean that there aren't certain demographic blocs in the EU which would inevitable dominate the politics. Nordics for example have a pretty special social and welfare system in their countries, yet they have small populations, who is gonna fight for their interests in the federal government? If you're gonna require them to send more money to subsidize Southern Europe, they will eventually struggle to afford all the welfare programmes that they have in place for their citizens.

Then you have V4 who has categorically different ideas about how migration should be managed, we aren't even as small as the Nordics, yet we have only been able to avoid policies being forced upon us by our governments throwing tantrums in the Council. If it was up the the democratically elected Parliament, they'd be sending buses of relocated refugees here already. And you can bet you'd find a majority for that in the current Parliament too.

Or take agricultural policy. Post-communist countries are a result of their past where agriculture was managed by huge state-owned entities, have till today large fields managed by large companies, whereas in the West, smaller and medium-sized farming companies are having a larger share of the market. If there was a federal government, the agriculture policy would be ever more skewed in favour of the big countries like France, Spain or Italy, we would simply have little chance with our voting power to make any changes.

And there are so many more and more examples. The thing is that the EU has a set of diverse countries, which have a different structure of an economy and some measures will simply work better for some countries and worse for others.

In the end, different interests groups will fight for what policies be implemented and it's pretty much unavoidable that peripherial voting groups will be marginalized. And who will be peripherial can differ based on what the issue is - in some cases, you are indeed right that most Czechs may find themselves in the mainstream bloc, so we may benefit. But some others may lose a lot. And in other instances, we will lose. We are quite strongly economically connected to Germany but that does not mean we need the same exact policies as Germany, we are still much poorer than them.

And unlike the old core small countries, we do not have the soft power to push for our interests. We do not have the know-how nor as much resources to spend on lobbying. We do not have such a strong diplomatic staff with over 50 years of experience in EU politics. I mean, look at the EU bodies now, look at the positions in them where the member countries do not have a guaranteed spot but they have to compete for them - the EU East is massively under-represented in all of them.",Czech Republic,/r/europe/comments/cw7lsb/macron_to_ambassadors_if_we_do_not_react_we_will/eycp41c/,kristynaZ,1567004991

&gt;What are the implications for MPs opposed to a no-deal Brexit?

&gt;  
&gt;Mr Johnson‚Äôs team are ready for such a showdown and believe the prime minister could win such a vote, given the reluctance of most Tory MPs to open the door to Number 10 to Mr Corbyn, even as head of a caretaker government that would seek to prevent a no-deal Brexit.

No not at all, social and environmental issues are not on the same level as ""I'd like to make more money"" issues.\

&gt;There are solid restrictions in place (https://ec.europa.eu/info/about-european-commission/service-standards-and-principles/codes-conduct/staff_en) for gifts, including a limit of 50 EUR. Lobbyists giving gifts are exceptional as well. Not the rule. Lobbyists work to establish productive relationships with decision-makers and convince with facts. Moreover, politicians and civil servants get high salaries to incentivise them not to take gifts and remain independent. Legislation is a complex affair involving many public and private decision-makers, you can't just buy legislation of off them with gifts. Again, confusion between bribery and lobbying / public affairs.

Yes, that is not good enough, and needs to be addressed (as so much about our healthcare system does) but it is not as large a problem as the Press makes it out to be.

Sort of same story with student loans. Yes, some people took out way, way too much debt for their degree. And others are simply doing their best to pay off loans. But, again, its a small subset of the country. Not denying that there is a problem, but it is not as wide-spread as you may think.

4395,"&gt; Because this concerns kinda political bullshit.

In what way? 

&gt; When Lithuania wants to built nuclear waste yard on the ground 3km away from the Belarus border and near national park and 30km away from the big Latvian city it is ok and they just ignore any claims from Belarus and Latvia.

I have not heard anything about that. Not that I searched for it or anything.  Mind showing me articles about it? 

&gt; When accidents happen on Ignalina demolishing yard they don't think that it is need to inform Belarus side

You mean the one's easy accessible in the state nuclear power safety inspectorate (VATESI) website? Information that you or me can check at any time but surely your government is aware of and has other means to inquire about such information?

&gt; but any small event on Astravec plant building is viewed as national treat

Define ""small"". I don't think replacing/repairing the core twice before the plant is even operation is small. Nevermind that the whole thing doesn't follow any international regulations to begin with.

&gt; I don't know what to say about Lithuania

You were not lost for words in your earlier comments with your gross generalizations.

&gt; It seems that at least some of them are really ebobo with their independence and well being.

What is that supposed to mean?

&gt; Of course, I could be wrong, but I personally had this impression.

Yes, I'm sure you met every Lithuanian on the planet.

&gt; Some of my friends from Poland also claim to have encountered extremely high arrogance among Lithuanians.

Is this where I start listing what people I know think of various ethnicities like it holds any water? 

&gt; So it can be that Lithuanians as a whole very often see himself higher than neighbor countries.

Is more widespread then we think even the US is catering to their 1% which is obviously wrong.

The only workable fix is to have really strong legal institutions and to have non profit organisations look into these people non stop and keeping a spotlight on their bullshit.

Problem is that is really hard to have strong law enforcement and snooping ngo's when they can just throw money and influence around to prevent those two factors going after them.

4763,"Not only that, assuming that the UK is out in eight weeks, the RoI and Malta are the only EU members remaining that have English as an official language, so I would assume that that'd drive some additional immigration up.  I remember reading an article on here quoting Jens Spahn, German deputy minister of finance, who was pissed off at immigrant waiters working in Berlin who only spoke English and hadn't learned German.  My guess is that Ireland will probably pick up some portion of migrants who don't want to deal with hassles like that for a while.  So my assumption is that Brexit -- removing the UK as a convenient destination for EU migration -- will cause immigration to Ireland to rise and put upwards pressure on the population.

That being said, Ireland also *just* legalized abortion, and I expect that to put downwards pressure on population relative to where it had been.

So now China's just not taking it and the world that used to export their plastics away and pretend they didn't exist had to do something else. Sometimes burning, maybe, but otherwise it's going to landfill.

Furthermore economics isn't a real science (and there is no Nobel prize in Economics), you can usually point to articles about studies for whatever political agenda you want to satisfy. In the article posted above, there isn't even a link to the actual study, which can be found [here](https://www.cep.eu/fileadmin/user_upload/cep.eu/Studien/20_Jahre_Euro_-_Gewinner_und_Verlierer/cepStudy_20_years_Euro_-_Winners_and_Losers.pdf). 

Basically they used an algorithm to determine which non-euro countries behaved similarly economically to specific euro countries before the euro introduction and then use this control group to determine a hypothetical GDP the euro countries would have without the introduction of the euro.

There are a number of problems with this. Regarding Italy in particular, the two countries weighted the most are the UK and Australia. - The UK did exactly the painful economic reforms Economists predict would help the Italian economy, but no italian politician has been able to get through. And [Australias economic growth](https://www.globaltenders.com/economy-of-australia.php/) has largely happened in mining exports to east Asia, something that isn't really an option for Italy.

4895,"For a ""Tatarstan"" to exist in Russia is unnecessary because about half the population of this entity is Russian. It'd probably be better to divide this territory and incorporate parts of it into other provinces. It may be offensive to Russian people for this entity to exist given how horrible and destructive the Mongol-Tatar yoke was for ancestors of Russians.

The Mongol-Tatar yoke that struck parts of Russia was a deadly virus. It was a significant reason for Russia lagging behind western European countries for so long. It had profoundly regressive effects on Russia's cultural, economic, and political development. Russia during the Mongol-Tatar invasions was more civilized and socioeconomically advanced than the primitive Mongol-Tatar societies. Russia's consolidation was delayed until the 17th and 18th centuries when Ukraine and Belarus were recovered from Polish rule. The feudal exploitation of Russians intensified, and Russians were oppressed by both their own and also Mongol-Tatar lords. 

The prince of Moscow Ivan III refused to pay tribute in 1476 and at the stand at the Ugra River in 1480, the Mongol-Tatar yoke was overthrown, a landmark in Russian history.",,/r/europe/comments/cw8z5y/tatarstan_legislators_recommend_rejecting_bill/eyalxi7/,ConsciousBook,1566965348

4900,"More or less, one thing that makes Salvini popular is similar to what made Mussolini popular. Like back then there's this idea that traditional parties are controlled by weak people who keep talking but they can't achieve anything in the end. It's fascinating how history can repeat itself. Another similarity is how the fascist party was elected together with another party and it didn't take many seats (Lega wasn't really elected together with M5S, they just collaborated) but then its popularity increased and 3 years later it won with like the 60%

Salvini some days ago asked for new elections so that italians can give him ""full powers"" as he's now at 30-40% (compared to 17% 1 year ago), but now PD and M5S should form  new government so there shouldn't be new elections until 2023 unless the government supported by PD and M5S fails (not so unlikely imo). In that case, or in 2023 we will see what happens. M5S supporters don't seem quite happy about M5S (anti-establishment, anti-PD party) now collaborating with PD itself, so those people will probably start voting Lega or stop voting from now on",,/r/europe/comments/cvtcuk/italy_poll/ey9x4ck/,Junkererer,1566954321

- clean beaches and rivers

- cleaner air
    - it already was clean
- lead free petrol
    - already had it
- restrictions on landfill dumping
    - so we have to bribe people to have the garbage dumps we need

    - anything imposed from without is wrong in principle anyway
- cheaper mobile charges
    - so you *didn't* raise energy prices to the point where people can't pay the bills anymore? That's news to me.
- cheaper air travel
    - so are you guys environmentalists or not? make up your mind. Besides, it's not true. Besides besides, commoners are happy if they can afford even one vacation a year. Anything about flights is about the jet set only.
- improved consumer protection and food labeling
   - read: rules so stringent everyone resorts to Chinese imports on the sly
   - also read: just always write *all* the allergies on the package so you don't get sued, no matter that that completely defeats the purpose
- a ban on growth hormones and other harmful food additives
  - no, anything *actually* harmful was already banned
  - double no, the EU has forced the lifting of bans on things that were actually harmful
  - triple no, the EU just bans what the big corporations' lobbyists tell them to ban
- better product safety
  - you banned all the cleaning products that work, proving nobody who makes decisions at the EU has ever needed to clean anything themselves
  - you banned working vacuum cleaners, you assholes
  - we resort to Chinese imports anyway, so fuck you. I don't know if they're safe. Probably not. But they work.

  - Europe-wide Mickey Mouse enforcement. Great if you're Disney (who aren't even European), terrible if you're anyone else.
- no paperwork or customs for export throughout the single market
  - brought about by common standards as achievable as they are enforceable, so it's just corruption now. Thanks.
- price transparency and removal of commission on currency exchanges throughout the eurozone
  - and all it took was the complete and utter destruction of Southern Europe, as well as making savings interest a thing of the past throughout the EU. Thanks guys.
- freedom to travel, live, and work across Europe
  - I love the new roaming Gypsy thieving gangs, they make life so much more interesting. But not as much as I love the destruction of worker's rights in Western Europe by poor Bulgarians undercutting everyone.
  - Thanks to EU rules it's now legally impossible for a Dutchman to compete with a Bulgarian, even in the Netherlands. Because you have to pay the Dutchman the Dutch minimum wage, but you only have to pay the Bulgarian the Bulgarian minimum wage, even if he's working in the Netherlands.
- funded opportunities for young people to undertake study or work placements abroad
  - Intentionally loosening people from the society they grew up in at a young age destroys that society.
  - Not that it matters, because this is only for the upper class. It's meant to breed a race of rootless cosmopolitans who will be ""Europeans"" by default, who will have nothing to belong to but the EU and who will come to rule us in 50 years' time if the EU has its say. That's the only purpose of ""Orgasmus"". It is to at least subjugate, if not outright destroy, our pre-existing societies. You have to be a real EU fanboy indeed to consider this a good thing.

  - What European health services? I have to pay out the nose for insurance. I have to pay extra for it to work abroad. 
- labour protection and enhanced social welfare

  - By ""enhanced social welfare"", do you mean my ever-increasing tax euros going towards Polish scammers? I think you do.
- smoke-free workplaces
  1. Fuck you. Some people like to smoke. It should be up to the owner, like it used to be.
  2. ""Enforcement""? What's that? It sounds like something for the plebs. Yes, let's go all in to prevent a freelancer from smoking in his own home since he's technically on the job. No, let's not do anything about the big multinationals.

  - Again, *already had it*, assholes.
- holiday entitlement
  - Not only did we already have it, you made it *worse*.
- The right not to work more than a 48-hour week without overtime
  - Go ahead and ask the Bulgarians.
  - Besides, we already had it, and it was 40 hours (though to be fair it didn't work back then either).
- strongest wildlife protection in the world
   - let's destroy European agriculture so that we may become fully dependent on imports
- improved animal welfare in food production
   - see above.
- EU-funded research and industrial collaboration
   - an EU-funded money black hole that taxes are thrown in and nothing comes out (except perhaps ""feminist glaciology"").
- EU representation in international forums
   - Cessation of national representation in international forums (that means ""fuck you if you're not Germany or France"")
- bloc EEA negotiation at the WTO
   - ""Fuck you if you're not Germany or France""
- EU diplomatic efforts to uphold the nuclear non-proliferation treaty
   - So what? 
- European arrest warrant.

- cross-border policing to combat human trafficking, arms and drug smuggling, and counter terrorism intelligence
   - a free ferry from Tripoli to Lampedusa, on which every African who wants to can travel to the promised land, where he will be given a luxurious life entirely for free funded by tax money from the people who do work, and where he will also be given complete immunity from any and all laws, no matter how badly they might act.

M5S is a populist party (sometimes said to be a left party but it depends tbh) and Lega a populist far-right party just like FDI and the others are tiny parties, so in the end there are like 2 center parties in Italy right now, and it's not looking good as they're just approximately 30% of the population

I don't think that I have to tell you why Forza Italia is not really a good choice (Berlusconi) and the party is almost dead anyway as there is nobody that can replace Berlusconi who is too old by now

For PD it's not so easy as it's composed by different internal ""currents"", and depending on which current is the most influential at any time PD can look different. From 2013 to 2018 the party secretary was Renzi (italian president from 2014 to 2016) and he was very centrist, he almost didn't even look like he was leading a left party.

&gt;The EU does know how to negotiate

The EU has given us much worse terms than you gave Canada. A ""third party/third country, whatever you want to call it. You've given Canada a much better deal than you will give us. I personally feel like you want to punish us because you're intensly worried about disintegration, but if you think that's what's the UK wants then you're mistaken. Even Churchill argued for a ""United states of Europe"". I know it's hard for most people in this sub to comprehend but even as a remainer, my country comes first. I'm for EU rights in the UK (and I think I've commented, and demonstrated, that the UK has shown a better hand here giving EU citizens the right to live, stay, raise families, and continue life as normal than the EU has). But I wont shy away from stating that the EU is using us (citizens) as a bargaining chip, despite accusing us of the same, whilst not giving us any right whatsoever in the EU. Again, if my comment history is not enough, i'm pro-eu, I don't like everything about it but I think it was better for us to remain and try to fix the things we didn't like than to leave and let you deal with it yourself. I'm immensely sad that we are leaving; I hope it's with a deal, but I feel that the EU doesn't want to deal with us, you'd rather we suffer, you'd rather we be made an example of etc. 

From my perspective, the EU is playing hardball. And maybe, so are we. You're treating us worse than you treated Canada or Japan, or even Brazil. You gave them the deal we wanted, but you won't grant us the same privilege despite us importing more EU goods than Canada, despite us being the EUs largest importer of German cars (in the EU) or Italian Wines, or French Cheese etc (it goes WAY beyond this, these are only examples). You want to play hardball, and I understand this point of view. But what the EU doesn't understand is that if you show Canada, or Japan, or Brazil or India, or Ukraine favourable trade deals but tell us, no you pay us billions and we decide alone what deal you get then we feel some animosity towards us. We feel singled out, we feel punished for leaving the union. If you treat us worse than you treat other ""3rd parties"" then we feel singled out about this. We feel like you treat us worse than you treat your worst enemy. We feel like you prefer to do a deal with American, or Russia, or Brazil, or China, or any other nation than us, because you want to teach us a lesson.

We can be your friends. If you would like us to be. Or even if you don't want us to be. We've shown without a shadow of a doubt that we are there to defend Europe. That we are willing to go to war for Europe. That we will defend to our last breath European Identity, individuality and freedom. But all we get back in response is: you want to leave, fuck you. We'll fuck you up, we'd rather accept Canada or Turkey than you lot.

I could just as easily point to one piece of data and do the same thing.  Have you seen any studies which have quantified the data? Any studies that say segregation is due to factor X, which has a y% influence on the outcome?  No?  Didnt think so. 

So, there is a lot of uproar right now regarding gentrification, which is a nicer way of saying white people move into a neighborhood.  How much does that contribute?  How would you fix this?  Laws already make it illegal to discriminate on race in business, so what else can one do?  

You seem like the type of person that gets *just* enough information to feed your ideological narrative, and you are incapable of understanding the subject further than that fleeting superficial piece of data.  Segregation in the US is a result of people making free choices.  When white people leave an area, it is white flight.  When they move back into an area, it is gentrification.  Almost like white people are a scapegoat for certain groups.  Weren't we just talking about similarities to Nazi Germany?  Having a scapegoat sounds awfully familiar.... Oh, but that similarity is irrelevant, because your entire worldview is shaped by your ideological bent and your hysterical reactions.

It's a long road and there's still a lot of room for improvement, but I can feel a major difference in the way that I'm treated, and I don't care whether some law which *says* that I have equal rights to men was passed before or after we joined the EU - I know the difference our membership has had on the minds and attitudes of people, and I'm very happy about it. Not to mention all of the other cool things which have come with the membership - I have visited the majority of European countries by now, participated in multiple education programs, and yes, exchanged currency without paying a huge commission like there used to be and my phone bill is noticeably smaller, too. Recently the mother of a friend of mine had an eye operation for which we don't have the equipment in my country - she could be treated in Germany without additional charges because our national health care system and the German one have a special agreement through the EU.

well, tbh the justification come from nature itself, and in particular from human mind (not the rational part of it): everybody want to have power and to be rich.

So, rich people usually are perceived as better than poor people, they are considered to have more quality than other humans with less power or resources, and usually they are positive models for every society.

Human evolution is very dependant on individuals. We don‚Äôt have a society based on some kind of hive mind, we are not ants. Most innovations and revolutions in human history can be resumed by just a few names of important people, ignoring the names of milions of people living and working with them in the same historical period.

This is the reason people love to vote for strong leaders, and they can accept only one winner at time. Names. Personality. Who has the power. It‚Äôs always the same: this is how human brain works.

5139,"&gt;The UK would have introduced a lot of ""good stuff"" anyway, that's correct, but the benefit of 27 countries introducing new legislation simultaneously means nobody is ""out on a limb"" while they pioneer (for example) industrial air pollution limits.

It also means that the EU can't act until most or all of the members involved are on board (and so either members act independently anyway, or where an intervention could be seen as protectionism, they can't act...). And obviously while the 28 members of the EU might all be roughly harmonised, the rest of the world isn't so... good for the single market I suppose, which is the point behind harmonisation.

&gt;It's a shame that outside of this union the UK won't be able to lead the discussion or easily influence the new legislation the remaining 26 will bring in the future. 

It'll be able to lead the discussion, a lot of this (as we are seeing with the G7) happens outside of an EU context too after all, but it will obviously not be able to have a say in a political union it isn't a member of.

&gt;We'll still have to abide by all the product standards etc. - see Denmark and other nations that do so voluntarily to facilitate frictionless trade.

For export to the EU? Obviously, and EU producers need to comply with whatever the UK's rules end up being (if there is deviation). The UK also has to abide by Chinese and US standards, although there are obviously international standards to.

Oh and there are 28 EU member states, 27 without the UK.

5247,"&gt; A Chechen exile shot dead in a Berlin park had fought against Russian troops and may have been assassinated by a Russian agent.
&gt; 
&gt; German police arrested a 49-year-old Russian man soon after the shooting on Friday, and found the suspected pistol and bike used in the attack.
&gt; 
&gt; The victim was Zelimkhan Khangoshvili and he had long been a target.
&gt; 
&gt; Witnesses quoted in German media said the killer approached Khangoshvili, aged 40, from behind on a bicycle and shot him twice in the head, then sped off.
&gt; 
&gt; The attack took place in the Kleiner Tiergarten park in Moabit, central Berlin, just before midday on 23 August.
&gt; 
&gt; Police were quickly on the scene and arrested the suspected killer, who had been spotted dumping the bike, pistol and other evidence into the nearby River Spree.
&gt; 
&gt; The gun, a Glock 26, was used with a silencer. Police divers recovered the gun and bike, the Berlin state prosecutor's office tweeted.
&gt;
&gt; The suspect, named only as Vadim S, reportedly had a large sum of cash in his flat, searched by investigators. He has been formally accused of ""treacherous killing"".
&gt; 
&gt; Vadim S travelled to Berlin from Moscow via Paris a few days before the attack, and had a return ticket to Moscow, German media report.",,/r/europe/comments/cw931s/russian_held_in_berlin_killeronabike_case/ey91znm/,form_d_k,1566933452

5252,"I understood your point. Let me retry. History has clearly demonstrating how appeasing to Nazis and taking them under democratic and free speech protection has lead to the abolishment of democracy and free speech by the Nazis who kept getting stronger and stronger. It also lead to mass-frenzy of peoples, usually against minorities and rampaging anti-intellectualism.

Now you are standing here and saying that calling people out for saying Nazi stuff or doing Nazi things will *also* make them more likely to be a Nazi. Which I disagree with. If someone tolerates people who say shit like 

The big problem is, that Hitler is usually painted as pure evil. But of course we all know that history is not just black and white."" (said by an influential AfD politician)

or

""We have to shut down the borders and then just endure the horrible pictures from the borders."" (said by an influential AfD politician)

or

""We Germans are the only people in the world who have planted a memorial of shame in the heart of their capital"", and suggested that Germans ""need to make a 180 degree change in their commemoration policy"". (said by an influential AfD politician)

because they aare feeling economically a bit worse off or have private problems, like almost everyone else, WE. NEED. TO. CALL. THEM. OUT. Displeasure with how your government functions, doesn't need to automatically lead to conspiracy theories like the great replacement or as another influential AfD politician said:

""These Pigs [refering to the German government] are nothing but puppets of the allies of the Second World War and have the mission to keep the German people (Volk) small and divided by creating micro-civil-wars, created in the urban centers by foreign infiltration (√úberfremdung).""

Even if the AfD had godlike climate, trade, social, educational, employment and foreign policies (WHICH IT BY THE WAY ABSOLUTELY DOES NOT), it would still not be okay to support it because of the NAZI shit their top-politicians say on the reg. And if you go along with that, I ain't gonna call you a non-Nazi, if you catch my drift. Oh, and ignorance of all these things doesn't absolve one either. If a person believes that a far-right party kind of represents them, but they just don't know jack shit except for some of their social media posts, then they are better off not voting at all.

&gt;I don't compare scenarios. Both were invasions that happened after ethnic disparity. 

That is *way* too simplistic of a comparison...

&gt;We can also take France for example. Remember who invaded Libya? 

Are you literally saying for this as well that it was the same? Do you even follow international events a bit??

&gt;I am repeating a valid argument. You are just crying how I am wrong. No arguments.

But pretty much only Russia considers these valid arguments...

&gt;Again, nope. This is not even a conversation. You're just pathetically crying to punish Russia for taking advantage of a situation that the West created. We started a coup in Ukraine thinking we could turn Ukraine toward us without effort. Russia took the chance and grabbed land. If there was no coup, Russia wouldn't have the opportunity to invade.

How many times are you gonna use the ""crying"" argument to defend a criminal? How did the West create the Russian crime again?? Why are you defending a criminal and blaming the victim?

That have been incorrect.

Continue.

&gt;self explanatory

But they're incorrect.

&gt;with a rudimentary understanding of the economy

I have a minor in economics.

&gt;It's not my job to explain to you how public spending increases the cost of living 

Well, public spending doesn't increase the cost of living.  Eventually public debt has to be paid off, which means taxes, but as long as GDP grows and tax revenues outpace the growth in debt, you actually have an easier time paying off said debt.  This has largely been true in Canada's case.

&gt;or how tariffs work.

You claimed tariffs, I challenged you to provide me with a list of new tariffs on food.  Considering that Canada has since 1999 signed CETA and the new, revised NAFTA, among other trade agreements, tariffs on food have actually fallen.  So this is not an explanation.

Everyone around here is trying to keep a certain narrative running, don't be daft. I've linked a few credible sources to bring nuance to your initial statement, you can see it for yourself.

&gt;Businesses don't 're-invest' 100% of their profits but apart from the hugely philanthropic projects of many companies and individuals, they tend to store money in banks, this increases the supply of loanable funds which decreases interest rates which makes it easier to start up small businesses, take steps to improve your life etc.

They tend to store a lot of money in stocks and real estate which doesn't really benefit anyone but themselves. And yes some of them provide loans to SMEs (or bigger ones) in Africa. That still doesn't say a lot about poverty rates, or multi-dimensional poverty around the world. Besides, I thought the financial crisis of 2008 would have told you that banks aren't exactly the paragons of virtue and good management you try to sell them as. They fucked over a whole lot of people.

Of course not. If you want to trade freely and fairly with your neighbours you‚Äôre gonna need an evolving set of commonly agreed regulations around health/safety/labour/etc. That‚Äôs literallly what the EU does.

You suggesting that other countries should not have a say in said regulations is something I genuinely don‚Äôt even know how to comment on.

5374,"&gt; Unless you are saying that someone stupid enough to get into a car they thought was an Uber where Uber doesn't exist deserves to get raped.

Deserves? No. 

But let's assume random tourist Joe steps in Metropolis and in order to find transportation he:

1. Does not use a phone call/app to call a radiotaxi or equivalent (otherwise he would have realized Uber does not work in Metropolis)

2. Does not use one of the official, colorful, city-licensed taxis in the official waiting area for taxis (perhaps because he found them expensive, or unsafe?)

3. As a consequence, walks around the airport, quite a far distance from the arrivals area (since no other transportation services are allowed there), until he finds a private car (remember: we are a far away from the area most travelers get their cars) which claims to offer him transportation somehow. 

4. He is kidnapped 

Now let's compare with tourist Daniel which arrives to Gotham and, searching for transportation:

1. Boards the first official looking taxi he finds

2. He is kidnapped


Now, at least in my internal scale of city safetiness, Metropolis ranks much higher than Gotham. Why? Gotham is so fucking insane you can be kidnapping even by boarding an official taxi at the airport! On the other hand Metropolis seems quite safe if you just apply some common sense. 

This is why I say there is a significant difference on this ""misidentification"". 

&gt; Thirdly, I've been to Valencia/Alicante/Benidorm, and they could not be any safer.

5386,"&gt; https://www.fraserinstitute.org/studies/canadas-rising-personal-tax-rates-and-falling-tax-competitiveness-2019

You're quoting the Fraser Institute, which is a heavily partisan right-wing think tank.  In the article you're linking, the Fraser Institute is picking on the Liberal party in particular, and is coming in with its usual claptrap about how taxes decrease competitiveness.  This conveniently ignores cases like the Nordics, which miraculously manage to grow despite having higher taxes.

The period they're quoting is from 2015, since the Liberals came to government.  There's a new tax on the highest earners (over $300,000), which hardly affects the cost of living for anyone except those people.

So kindly fucking read the fucking bullshit you fucking claim as a fucking source.  I'm not about to waste my time rebutting garbage links you throw in to your discussion in an attempt to bog me down.

&gt;Canada has abnormally high levels of tariffs, especially on food. Fact.

Which have not gone up, and have in fact come down.  So tariffs are NOT an explanation for RISING food costs.

&gt;Public spending increases the cost of living. Take macro 201.

Public spending does NOT increase the cost of living.  It CAN, and that cost is not evenly distributed.  There's a difference.

If I tax the top earners in the country to subsidize food prices, that is a reduction in the cost of living.  Due to the inherent inefficiency of transferring wealth (via the cost of administrating the program), there is a NET overall loss but this loss is absorbed entirely by those wealthy enough to be taxed.

So why don't you go take a 350-level econ course about public expenditure or taxation policy and outcomes.",Canada,/r/europe/comments/cw5j6d/ireland_no_1_tax_haven_as_us_giants_cash_83bn_in/ey8rak7/,sluggathugga,1566926542

For a modern politician who wants to be taken seriously in any way, being a Nazi would just not work and people, including politicians, know that.

They are national socialists, trump for sure at least and Nazi describes a follower of national socialism and it's idiology. Racism, anti-democracy, anti-liberal, anti-communism, racial and socialdarwinism being some of the cornerstones. With Johnson I find it harder to understand...he calls himself libertarian. Seems like libertarian nationalism, which isn't so far off.

Yes, it's called writing. Sometimes you don't just type out exactly what you want to say. You use metaphors, you use figures of speech, you use sarcasm, and you use imagery.. All to drive home your point. 

Extract of article, because it's behind paywall:

&gt;Ah Denmark, what a country. If any society breathes the spirit of liberty, this is it.

&gt;It was only a few weeks ago that I was in Copenhagen for some international conference, and as ever I rose early and went for a run. As I passed through some yuppie zone of warehouse conversions and posh restaurants I saw to my amazement that the Danes had also got up early for exercise ‚Äì and they were diving stark naked into the bracing waters of the harbour. And I thought to myself ‚Äì that‚Äôs the Danes for you; that‚Äôs the spirit of Viking individualism. I mean, we have a climate warmer than Denmark; but even so, would you expect to see Brits disrobing and plunging into the waters of Canary Wharf, or even Greenwich? We are pretty easy-going, but not that easy-going.

&gt;Denmark is the only country in Europe, as far as I know, that still devotes a large proportion of its capital city to an anarchist commune, called Christiania, where I remember spending a happy afternoon 25 years ago inhaling the sweet air of freedom. It is the Danes who still hold out against all sorts of EU tyrannies, large and small.

&gt;They still chew their lethal carcinogenic tobacco; they still eat their red-dyed frankfurters; they still use the krone rather than the euro; they still refuse to let foreigners buy holiday homes in Jutland; and of course it was the heroic population of Denmark that on that magnificent day in June 1992 stuck two fingers up to the elites of Europe and voted down the Maastricht treaty ‚Äì and though that revolt was eventually crushed by the European establishment (as indeed, note, they will try to crush all such revolts), that great nej to Maastricht expressed something about the Danish spirit: a genial and happy cussedness and independence.

&gt;It is a spirit you see everywhere on the streets of Copenhagen in the veneration for that supreme embodiment of vehicular autonomy, the bicycle. The Danes don‚Äôt cycle with their heads down, grimly, in Lycra, swearing at people who get in their way. They wander and weave helmetless down the beautiful boulevards on clapped-out granny bikes, with a culture of cycling in which everyone is treated with courtesy and respect. Yes, if you wanted to visit a country that seemed on the face of it to embody the principles of JS Mill - that you should be able to do what you want provided you do no harm to others ‚Äì I would advise you to head for wonderful, wonderful Copenhagen.

&gt;So I was a bit surprised to see that on August 1 the Danes joined several other European countries ‚Äì France, Germany, Austria, Belgium ‚Äì in imposing a ban on the niqab and the burka ‚Äì those items of Muslim head-gear that obscure the female face. Already a fine of 1000 kroner ‚Äì about ¬£120 ‚Äì has been imposed on a 28-year-old woman seen wearing a niqab in a shopping centre in the north eastern town of Horsholm. A scuffle broke out as someone tried to rip it off her head. There have been demonstrations, on both sides of the argument. What has happened, you may ask, to the Danish spirit of live and let live?If you tell me that the burka is oppressive, then I am with you. If you say that it is weird and bullying to expect women to cover their faces, then I totally agree ‚Äì and I would add that I can find no scriptural authority for the practice in the Koran. **I would go further and say that it is absolutely ridiculous that people should choose to go around looking like letter boxes;** and I thoroughly dislike any attempt by any ‚Äì invariably male ‚Äì government to encourage such demonstrations of ‚Äúmodesty‚Äù, notably the extraordinary exhortations of President Ramzan Kadyrov of Chechnya, who has told the men of his country to splat their women with paintballs if they fail to cover their heads.

&gt;If a constituent came to my MP‚Äôs surgery with her face obscured, I should feel fully entitled ‚Äì like Jack Straw ‚Äì to ask her to remove it so that I could talk to her properly. If a female student turned up at school or at a university lecture looking like a bank robber then ditto: those in authority should be allowed to converse openly with those that they are being asked to instruct. As for individual businesses or branches of government ‚Äì they should of course be able to enforce a dress code that enables their employees to interact with customers; and that means human beings must be able to see each other‚Äôs faces and read their expressions. It‚Äôs how we work.

&gt;All that seems to me to be sensible. But such restrictions are not quite the same as telling a free-born adult woman what she may or may not wear, in a public place, when she is simply minding her own business.

&gt;I am against a total ban because it is inevitably construed ‚Äì rightly or wrongly ‚Äì as being intended to make some point about Islam. If you go for a total ban, you play into the hands of those who want to politicise and dramatise the so-called clash of civilisations; and you fan the flames of grievance. You risk turning people into martyrs, and you risk a general crackdown on any public symbols of religious affiliation, and you may simply make the problem worse. Like a parent confronted by a rebellious teenager determined to wear a spike through her tongue, or a bolt through her nose, you run the risk that by your heavy-handed attempt to ban what you see as a bizarre and unattractive adornment you simply stiffen resistance.

&gt;The burka and the niqab were certainly not always part of Islam. In Britain today there is only a tiny, tiny minority of women who wear these odd bits of headgear. One day, I am sure, they will go.

&gt;The Danes swim starkers in the heart of Copenhagen. If The Killing is to be believed, their female detectives wear Faroe sweaters on duty, as is their sovereign right. If Danish women really want to cover their faces, then it seems a bit extreme ‚Äì all the caveats above understood ‚Äì to stop them under all circumstances. I don‚Äôt propose we follow suit. A total ban is not the answer.

If you genuinely come to the conclusion that Boris is Islamophobic after reading that, then you are a fucking idiot. 

&gt;What on earth do you think supports your claim in this article? Good heavens.

5676,"TL;DR

Capitalism is inherently exploitative as they do a fraction of the work yet get most of the pay

Capitalism is doomed to fail as the Earth has finite resources yet Capitalism demands infinite growth

Capitalists can heavily and negatively affect the working class and can even use influence to topple nations they don't like (e.g. Iran after nationalising their oil, The Banana Wars)

 The wealth gap only grows and [more people are being pushed *under* the poverty line, not getting lifted off of it.](https://youtu.be/A6VqV1T4uYs) Our planet is dying and climate change will be irreversible in 11 years. the biggest polluters, however, want to profit and polluting is cheaper than not polluting. So, the logical choice is to pollute, and if regulations are imposed, those companies will simply move somewhere more ""libertarian"", leaving thousands unemployed. Unless the motive of profit is gotten rid of this will continue to happen.

Communism has worked in multiple nations (that I listed) 

Communism has had many benefits: 

\-literacy rates boosted to 56.6% in 1926 and 75% in 1937.

‚Äì feed everyone: no major famines were registered after the late 1940's (and keep in mind Genocide carried out by the Germans (General Plan Ost) also happened).

‚Äì be fairly socially progressive (given the historical context): female vote, homosexuality, efforts to end racism and more came first in the East, then in the West.

‚Äì have democracy: search about the Soviet system and its adjacent. you'll be surprised with how democratic it is. One-party rule may sound bad, but if the party more accurately represents the public than 100 parties controlled by the ruling class, I think it's safe to say that the system is more democratic.

&gt; Until you start making sense. If you need extra capacity to meet peak demand, why would you build a nuclear plant? Who would suggest doing such a thing? Peak demand, over and above baseload, requires flexible plant (cheap to build, saves fuel when not in use). 

Oh, so now you want a peaker. Let me quote the very point YOU SHOT DOWN that i made in the very beginning of this entire comment chain:

&gt;The only reasonable idea i have to solve this problem is that we overproduce electricity from renewable and nuclear during summer and make hydrogen/methane with it for use in winter. Methane, while even more expensive to produce, is easier and cheaper to store.  
&gt;  
&gt;After all, for renewable or nuclear energy, it never makes any sense to throttle their production down. So why not use the surplus energy to prepare for winter.

In your examples, you are missing some important points:

* There's nothing special about dividends. Whether capital gains come through dividends or appreciation is irrelevant. If you can't pay your taxes from cash you'll just have to sell some shares, or other assets. Your purported net loss doesn't exist.

* Nobody will own just 20bn‚Ç¨ in SAP shares, but will likely choose an asset allocation that is better at managing risk and allows them to have enough cash for all their expenses incl. taxes.

* People at the lower end of the wealth tax will enjoy a substantially lower total tax rate when you take into account tax allowances. Right now that allowance is effectively set at ‚àû‚Ç¨.

&gt;You can't really oppose the government in Cuba without getting in trouble (this includes supporting different strains of socialism from the party, e.g. anarchism), there is just one party

Two things here: It's illegal as such to be an anarchist or a liberal in Cuba, but I have no delusions that if you advocate the overthrow of their current system it's likely that you get into trouble, if you advocate US intervention it's definite you'll get into trouble; now in Germany if you're an anarchist and advocate the destruction of the German state the Verfassungsschutz will observe you but leave you mostly alone until you wave YPG flags or commit violent acts against the state; but I ask you: Can you really compare Germany with Cuba? Just with their level of development, and international geopolitical situation? I think not. It's not like most Latin American countries are better democracies than Cuba.

About the party, that's not really true. Other parties as such are not illegal, but the point about the Cuban system is that parties *are not allowed* to run in elections, that includes the communist party. The communist party in Cuba is more of a big social club, or lobby organisation, that is the dominant political organisation because of Cuba's history.

Yes, I'd argue considering the conditions they have to work with, they are a democracy. I'd even argue that some aspects of it - like the absence of money in politics and the communal direct democratic grassroots system - is somewhat better than our representative system, but of course it isn't perfect.

Mind you that those dividends are payed from a corporate profit that is already taxed by 30%.

5969,"&gt; French general Charles de Gaulle delivered a famous speech at the Paris city hall championing the courage and determination of an empowered France that stood up to liberate itself from the occupation of Nazi Germany.

Lol.

If only I had been awake to see what was really happening, like how the Amazon actually got set on fire by the evil organizations trying to destroy Brazil. And the melting of the glaciers of Greenland was a conspiracy of those greedy scientists planting bombs there just so they can annoy governments.

And if I do believe what you're saying, then we should never believe journalists and it's basically a waste of time wanting to know anything about the world because there's a chance it's not completely correct anyway.
