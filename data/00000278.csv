So you had a very rural region with bad roads and nearly no major railway connections to Vienna and the big Austrian cities (meaning: no one ever went there), that never had been part of the HRE and ""Austria proper"".

5,"&gt;BRUSSELS — Many Britons see their country as a brave galleon, banners waving, cannons firing, trumpets blaring. That is how the country’s voluble foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, likes to describe it.

Typical american journalistic hyperbole. No one sees the UK like that, aside from a few drunken racists, and the deluded idiots that shamble about the halls of westminster, feeding off of the teet of the country like the parasites that they are. I include Corbyn in that statement.

&gt;poor Theresa May

Yeah, poor Teresa May; arguably one of the most unpopular Prime Ministers in a hundred years, not able to hold a majority and responsible for the continuiation of some of the most brutal, underhanded policies that do nothing but subvert democracy and attack the sick and the in need at every turn. Poor Teresa May indeed. Whatever did she do to deserve the wolves at her door, or the disquiet in the voice of the country?

&gt;I’ve lived and worked for nine years in Britain, first during the Thatcher years and then again for the last four politically chaotic ones. While much poorer in the 1980s, Britain mattered internationally. Now, with Brexit, it seems to be embracing an introverted irrelevance.

Then look out of the window Steven, better yet, look outside of the London bubble that has become so fundamentally detached from the country that *it* wants independence from the rest of the UK, the rest of the UK hates the city, and has contributed to a widening gap of distrust.

&gt;The ambitious Mr. Johnson was crucial to the victory of Brexit in the June 2016 referendum. But for many, the blusterings of Boris have lost their charm.

Perhaps because in his top drawer, he had both a statement for Britain leaving, and and argument for Britain remaining at the same time. His political dieals have ruined a country's political standing, its diplomatic credibility, and all so he can help his Eton chums get richer. The man should be tried for Treason.

&gt;Britain — renowned for its pragmatism, its common sense, its political stability and its unabashed devotion to small business (“a nation of shopkeepers”) — has become nearly unrecognizable to its European allies.

Yeah, but to be fair, the media isn't exactly doing a great job of bolstering the public perception that the EU *are* our allies, best on punishing the people - not the political establishment for their short sighted lack of vision for an exit, or prejudiced approach to all but the fine details of how to line their own pockets before the real business of offering stability can begin.

&gt;“People need to look again at Britain,” said Daniel Brössler, a correspondent for the German daily Süddeutsche Zeitung. “It’s no longer the country they understood it to be their whole lives.”

This I agree with. Exit from the EU is a symptom of a wider problem int he UK; for years we've been struggling to find our place in a post imperialist world; we hang on to our monarchy like it has any *real* power or relevance, and our political system is so shambolic that a party that had no majority can remain in power because a bunch of shady thugs from northern Ireland can show our ""leader"" (let's use that term loosely and laughingly) where the magic money tree she says doesn't exist is actually to be found.

The problem with the UK and the EU, is that the country has had a culture separate from the overall mindset of the mainland - it's not surprising, we've had to, and for the longest time, doing things alone has worked well for us. The Global community no longer works in the old way, and I think that scares a number of people. Strive forward, Britain...Ever upwards to new and better heights.

&gt;Meanwhile, with the Conservative government so riven and rudderless, the old hard lefty Jeremy Corbyn is leading the opposition Labour Party back into an equally fantastical socialist past.

Except Corbyn, the latest in a line of champagne socialists that have been seduced by celebrity, also supports exit.

eh. I'm done with the rest of this American gossip mongering tripe. It's making me angry that they can't just focus on Trump and accept that things are generally shit everywhere.

So what is that supposed to mean? The people in the Mediterranean don't enter the EU illegally, they are simply reaching the first EU border official in an EU harbour to apply for asylum. Nothing about reaching the border and applying for asylum at the first possibility is illegal.

&gt;That simply means that anyone who has not entered the schengen area legally is deported

You don't seem to know how a deportation works, at all. So, where do you deportation them to and how? Do you ""just"" put them into a plane and fly them to Lybia?

&gt;Any illegal immigrants are deported straight back from the country they were coming from

105,"Of course Catalonia has a moral basis for independence. The Spanish state does not own Catalonia, it’s people or it’s future. Spain is supposed to be a democracy. And in a democracy it is the consent of the people who legitimise the state. How else does law derive it's legitimacy? Can Spain just make a constitutional amendment right now saying ""elections are actually over lol peace out"" and then it's legit and nobody can argue with it?

Without consent the state is nothing but a bunch of people telling us what they can and can't do at their own will. And that's all the Spanish state is to Catalonia if it does not have the consent of Catalan society at large.

Spain's whole approach to Catalonia has been characterised by utterly obscene arrogance. If Spain had handled this like the UK handled Scotland this would've all been over years ago with minimal drama. 

Instead Spain treated Catalonia with the highest degree of disrespect it possibly could within the confines of western politics. It decreed immediately that the consent of the Catalans doesn't even matter because Catalonia is the State's legal property whether they like it or not.  It supressed their self-determination at every stage from the moment when they tore up the statue of autonomy, when they denied the referendum even as Catalans repeatedly elected pro-referendum parliaments, when they forcibly supressed their voting, when they disbanded Catalonia’s elected parliament.

And now we have chaos. And potentially it will get even worse. What will happen now if Catalonia again returns a government that intends to secede? Will Rajoy just overturn the election he himself called and put Catalonia under the permanent control of the ministry of the interior forever? What a ridiculous and totally avoidable situation Spain has put itself in. Even the Tories weren’t this retarded.

Although later on some of the princes started thinking of it as a German empire (and it even got ""of the German nation tacked onto its name at one point), the Emperors (by this point always Habsburgs) very much wanted to preserve this grand idea of a universal christian empire, and saw their realm as bigger than any one culture. Although by this point most of their Empire was German (they'd lost Italy some time ago), they held onto quite a few non-german areas, particularly in the east, so it is not surprising that being part of the empire didn't make the Dutch feel German. The two things were not really connected. It was only once the HRE was disbanded, and the Austrian's power waned (the turning point was their losing the Austro-Prussian war) that the idea of an empire specifically of the Germans became an accepted possibility.

155,"Serbia has one of the fastest growing economies in Europe. New highways are being built, more money is being spent on education and it is breaking new ground in the renewable energy, construction and engineering sectors. Serbia’s ability to attract substantial foreign investment, particularly from China, has been vital to this transformation. But this is now at risk.

Securing inward investment is vital not just for growth and employment in the country, but to make the judicial, political and economic reforms necessary for Serbia’s accession to the Economic Union. China is bringing new technical expertise and innovation. Yet, rather than embrace a new vision for Europe, the European Union’s scepticism over China threatens to undermine future growth and stability.

European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker spelt out the EU wariness of China’s programme for development in his State of the Union speech. “If a foreign-owned company wants to purchase a European harbour, part of our energy infrastructure or a defence technology firm, this should only happen with transparency, with scrutiny and debate,” he said. Germany, France and Italy have also looked to find ways to “screen investments” into the EU, showing the protectionist posture taking shape within the EU.

These proposals are vague at best, but the draft regulations include procedures to assess, investigate, authorise, condition, prohibit or unwind foreign direct investments. This week the EU also agreed to new rules to guard against lower-priced Chinese imports.

All this sets up a potential clash with China’s ambitions in the Balkans, and is likely to have a direct impact on Serbia. Our country

Serbia is at the centre of China’s “One Belt, One Road” infrastructure initiative, a transport and trade corridor running from China to Germany, via Greek ports, the Balkans and central Europe.

This means money has been poured into building roads and high-speed railways, contributing to a 2.8 per cent rise in Serbia’s economic growth last year. According to data, the total trade volume between China and selected western Balkan economies reached €3.3bn in 2015-16. Serbia accounted for almost half of that total trade volume.

Last month, the government also announced that it expects to open 10,000 jobs through a joint €300m project with the China Road and Bridge Corporation for the construction of an industrial park in Belgrade, allowing Serbia to keep its young engineers and develop nanotechnology, biotechnology and IT systems.

The question of whether external influencers in the region, namely Russia and China, offer any alternative vision, as some fear, was debated at the Belgrade Security Forum this week. The simple answer, they concluded, is no. Indeed, Europe remains Serbia’s most important foreign trade partner, and it is committed to doing everything necessary to achieve our strategic goal of EU integration. The progress Serbia has made is reflected by this week’s announcement that five more chapters in its membership negotiations with the EU could be opened by the end of the year.

For Serbia to prosper, it needs to make it easier, not harder, to attract investors who can bring more jobs, improve living standards and lift economic growth. Investments from China have had a positive and immediate impact on Serbia’s transformation, effectively helping it to become a respected political and economic force in the region. These reforms are not only bringing Serbia closer to the EU, but are crucial to establishing peace and stability in the region. As President Alexandar Vucic said to the UN: “Economic growth and reforms are a prerequisite for [a] better life, in the first place, for the poor and the middle class.”

While preparing to screen Chinese investments, the EU has been so far been unwilling to present credible alternatives. This vacuum, coupled with “accession fatigue” created by the EU’s neglect of Serbia, has dented confidence in the EU. A new Regional Co-operation Council survey this week showed that old wounds may be harder to heal than the EU imagines.

Serbia is the only country in south-east Europe where the people who perceive EU accession as a bad thing now outnumber those who view it positively. The scale of the challenge facing both Serbia and the EU is that 38 per cent of Serbian citizens don’t believe their country will ever join the EU, and only 18 per cent expect Serbia to join the bloc by 2025. Putting politics ahead of the economy will only compound this view.

For China, the Balkans clearly represent a gateway to larger European markets. This also presents an opportunity for Europe to embrace the positive contribution China is making to this region, and work with China to develop free-trade networks that will benefit everyone. Particularly with the US and Donald Trump sticking to an “America First”, isolationist policy, the future prosperity of Europe, I believe, depends on it.

Europe also needs to do more to protect countries like Serbia. What Serbia needs now is consistent reassurance over EU membership. This doesn’t necessarily mean speeding up the EU accession process, but being more visible to the Serbian people to win hearts and minds, and ensuring greater access to the western European market.

The most positive sign that the EU approach to Serbia is changing came this week when Johannes Hahn, the Commissioner for European Neighbourhood Policy and Enlargement Negotiations promised: “Serbia belongs in Europe and will soon become part of the European family”.

Now it is time to put those words into action.

The university’s executive board had received an increasing number of complaints about religious students “disturbing university life”, explained Dieter Lenzen, Hamburg’s president. “External Salafists” had been pressuring female Muslim students to wear traditional Islamic dress such as the veil, he said.

While justification does not matter to you it matters to leaders in geo-politics, economy and industry and every other rational person. The law is not backwards just because you dislike it as every other province of Spain, Catalonia has the option to convince others to support it's initiative and amend the constitution and pave the way for an independence. Other provinces have a full and equal say in the matter as is heavily affects them. If Catalonia had not been successful at that it could have with truth and facts presented to the international community the any real justification for it's independence and present a properly formed plan (to be negotiated) how they intended this independence to how. What deadlines the people, economy and industry had to make appropriate adjustments, what to expect, prepared provisions for people who are against independence etc. Prepare a reason for why half the populations voice does not matter.  

And most importantly they should have protected the integrity of the ballot box had they still opted for the illegal vote. While vote would still have been illegal at least they would have gained any real international support for their independence which is what would have helped them put things in motion.

I think the UK also works in the same way that's why the Tories needed an Irish party's support to form goverment (I don't remember the name sorry). 

It's like if PP with their 130ish deputies formed goverment instead of calling elections or reaching an  agreement with other parties when they needed more yes votes than no votes in Congress.

It also failed in the Spanish Senate (and it would have in Congress if it were needed) with a supermajority.

There wasn't external pressure to rush the process.

329,"&gt; To be clear, I don't have any strong feeling on Catalonian independence. I don't think the Catalonian people are particularly oppressed, or that **the Spanish government is some fascist state**, nor do I think that Catalonian behaviour has been ideal or even legal.

The government is not the State, but just one of the three branches of a State. It was not the government that gave the orders to suspend the referendum, it was the courts. 

&gt; The argument that the referendum was illegal does not make it ethically acceptable to put police officers in between people and expressing their desire to vote. This should quite obvious regardless of whether the referendum was illegal or not. The use of force in this case undermines the moral authority of any government.

The courts do not care if something is ethical or not, only if something is according to the law or not. The catalan secessionists ignored the orders of the courts and the courts answered by sending the police to enforce their decision. This was not a case of putting police forces between people and their desire to vote, it was just courts enforcing their decision of preventing the referendum from taking place until they could determine its legality.

You seem to think that the appeal to the law and the use of police force is on itself a sign of authoritarianism, but how would a non-authoritarian state act? Are you suggesting that the Spanish courts should just look the other way when someone was ignoring their orders? Do you think that it was in Rajoy's hands to grant whatever the secessionists were asking, no matter if it was against the constitution? Note that the disproportionate use of force by the police is a different matter here.

Ultimately, the question you want to ask is whether Spain is a democratic state or not. In a democracy the rights of minorities are protected and the law is just a manifestation of what the majority of society consider to be just, which means that the use of police force to uphold the law is not only justified but required. On the other hand, separatists think that Spain is not a democracy because the law does not recognize what they consider to be their rights. Since they have not been able to change the law, they think it is justified to break it.

In my opinion, separatists are wrong. the Spanish constitution guarantees the rights of Catalans to their culture and language. The catalan government has control over their education and health care. Catalans have representation in the national parliament and have a voice in changing any law that affects them, just as much as citizens from any other region (and arguably more) If they want to change any law, even the constitution, they can do it if they get enough support from other political forces, but the fact that they do not have that support at the moment, does not justify breaking the law.

415,"&gt; So if a country like Montenegro fulfills all the standards needed to join EU, what is the reason for it not to join?

Nothing to do with Montenegro being a Balkan country and almost everything to do with the fact that I want the EU to succeed and for that we need to ensure that potential members want the EU for reasons that go beyond pure economic and trade benefits. As brexit teaches, having countries that stay in the EU for just the benefits of the single market does not work in the long term.

Once a country in the EU, it is extremely difficult to ensure that that country continues to comply with the Copenhagen criteria (i.e. the political and economic criteria that a country must meet in order to get in), and those criteria are IMHO already too lax. We see it now with Hungary and Poland. PiS in Poland and Orban in Hungary would not pull off their quasi dictatorial stunts, if they weren't sure that the EU cannot do much to counter their desire to become more authoritarian and illiberal. It is not just my opinion, it is actually something that Orban himself stated some years ago: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-07-28/orban-says-he-seeks-to-end-liberal-democracy-in-hungary.

A sovereign country has all the rights to become the next Russia or the next Turkey, if they want to. But I don't want that country to be anywhere close to the EU. The enlargement to the east is not wrong per se, it just happened too soon for too many countries. Most of EE states are just too young and unstable. So I prefer to be overcautious that allow a country whose PM could potentially become the next Orban.

and then you drive withthis car to a place that is known for the cheapest stuff, that has almost no luxury trademarks to offer and where people buy cant afford to buy somewhere else.

that is to me an inconsistency. you cant spend lots of money to make it look like you have lots of money and spend lots of money to enjoy luxury and then be too greedy to go shopping where all the people buy who dont care for the actual price of their milk.

561,"&gt; who were / are not happy with some of the treaties ? 

Which treaties are these?  I'm referring to the freedom of movement portion of the bilateral treaties.  Swiss voters were promised the ability for the government to enact certain mechanisms if immigration was seen exceed certain bounds.  Regardless what you think of it, I maintain that the EU could have saved itself a lot of trouble by showing a degree of readiness to compromise - for example granting a transition period, or some other concessions to sweeten the deal.

&gt; Switzerland doesn’t really matter in the grand scheme of things 

That's pretty dismissive, I don't accept this.  Switzerland matters a lot, but probably not in the way that you imagine.

Let me explain:  it's a small, stable country, with a prosperous economy and a GDP a little less than the Netherlands, and would be a net contributor to the EU.  So that'd be a good thing for the EU to have - but yes, inherently, it doesn't really matter.

Where it is important is that Swiss exceptionalism is complexity - all those bilateral treaties, regular spats about air traffic, movement of people, banking secrecy, etc., that all costs money, time, and attention that would be much better spent elsewhere.

And you touch on the other aspect - Switzerland, despite the fact that it is very tightly tied to the EU economically (much more so than Norway), is an example of how a country can ""go it alone"".  As such it will always stand out as an unwitting example for separatists and anti-EU parties.

589,"That the worst thing you can say about independentism is that it's ""irritating"" explains how you might be confused about the reaction to it. 

They inequivocally and unilaterally declared independence from Spain, which was not just illegal, it was unethical by all acounts: it was declared based on an illegimate referendum with no democratic guarantees whatsoever, on oh so many layers, from being unconstitutional to not being recognized by the opposition, and with a participation under 50%.

This declaration was to be imposed on 2/3rds of the population who do not want to be independent. And this is not an imposition like raising taxes, this goes against the very essence of the modern  european state that has provided, if not anything else, unheard of peace and freedom for decades.

Obviously nobody should want for police brutality, but we have seen worse for much less in Spain and the rest of Europe. Of course the criminal investigations are not going to solve a political problem, but should they be put on hold then? Should we free Spain from the reign of the law for a while?

People must be held accountable for their actions. Nobody has been prosecuted in Spain for being independentist or forming,  belonging, or voting for an independentist party. But some people and some parties have cornered all three powers of the state into a point where any reaction will look as a worse case scenario. This is not because of excesses on the side of the state, this is because the scenario has been manufactured by the independentist movement to ""**bootstrap**"" its oppresion. Of course they have no moral basis for independence on any reasonable, modern framework: they enjoy the many freedoms that the Spanish state and the EU provide; they are not discriminated against, they have a degree of self-government that not only surpasses most of Spain's regions, it surpasses most of Europe's regions.

So again, what they are doing is ""bootstraping"" an oppresion: they provoke and provoke, each time going a bit further, each time testing the foundations of the state a bit more, reaching for the core: the constitution. And that was when they crossed the line they were hoping for. Of course the whole declaration of independence had no real intent of proclaiming an independent state, as proven by how there was no actual infrastructure in place for it. No, the only objective was **provocation**, to create a reaction that can be manufactured as ""oppresion"", an oppresion that would, in their eyes, legitimize a unilateral declaration of independence. This is the point where we are right now: the politicians in jail want to be perceived as political detainees. The police force is not just opression, it's a police state, an authoritarian state. Puigdemont is a president in exile, not fleeing from justice.

I hope this can help you put into perspective the actions being taken on either side.

Canada has Wal Marts, but everything is 30-50% more expensive and they have 1/5th the selection.

Finland was a state within a state, with its own senate and its own Diet, its own local officials, legislation, army, money (the mark) and postage stamps. And to top it all off, Finland was separated from the empire by an official border.

In Czech and many other gendered languages, the ""masculine"" gender is also default. If you say ""student"" in Czech, you mean all students, not just male students. Only when you need to actually distinguish between the sex of a particular student, you say ""(ten) student"" or ""(ta) studentka"". It's not a sign the language is biased against women, you need a default gender because spelling all the variants in all cases would make the language extremely cumbersome and irritating to hear/write.

824,"&gt; High profile ministers wanting different outcomes and even publicly being in disagreement.

That's pretty standard part of negotiations though, there are several possible outcomes and each has there own pros and cons, some people lean one way others lean the other. 

But to me at least the aim of the UK in talks has been fairly clear for at least a year now. 

Leave the single market and customs union, CETA style trade deal with the EU which is as far reaching as possible and the UK willing to contribute to the EU budget for better terms of access. 

&gt;Another big reason for me is the complete lack of any meaningful facts.

I do agree that there is very little information available with regards to the details of exactly what the UK wants and is willing to offer. 

But again this is a negotiation and that is how it works, if the UK publicly announces that it will pay £2bn a year for better trade terms, that is going to be the opening EU position. You can't make that kind of information public and expect not to get taken to the cleaners by the other side. 

So that seems like common sense and its reasonable for them not to make that information public. ",,/r/europe/comments/7abm8s/we_are_reporters_for_business_insider_uk_we_have/dpc1qev/,Tamicantuto,1509804298

&gt;We think everyone is a thief.

I have a fun anecdote about this. The first time (years ago) I visited the US I had a rental car, and one day I had to fill it up. So I pull up to the gas station, get out and examine the pump. The card reader was disabled as it was business hours, so I pick up the nozzle and try to pump gas, but it doesn't work. I spend some time trying and examining the pump but I figure nothing out. Then I notice a girl calling me from the shop: ""You have to pay first!"" 

I go inside, I'm a bit embarrassed and apologise, I tell her that where I'm from we pay after we pump (also because if I'm filling the tank I don't know exactly how much will go in, so how do I pay that first? I was unaware of how common credit cards were in the US).

The girl gives me an amused look and tells me ""oh no, we can't do that here, if we did everyone would leave without paying"" 

Now it's my time to be amused: ""Well Miss, I'm pretty sure that if it works in Italy it can work ANYWHERE!""

Yes.

Bush could be written off as a one time thing, but with Trump we know the US didn't learn from it, it can happen again and it COULD be worse.

Well that right there tells you which side was the wall. If they ask for something (a referendum) and you keep saying No over and over again, you leave them no choice. What's the compromise here? You either let them hold a referendum or you don't. What is the legal way when 70-80% of the Catalan population wants to hold a referendum and they can't? They keep asking for it, and the answer is always no. The first referendum was a non-legally binding opinion poll, seems like a fair compromise, but even that was considered too much by Spain. 

What I'm saying is Canada had the foresight to see that this line of reasoning would only lead to the instability that Spain finds itself into today and would eventually do more harm than good.

1070,"&gt;But why?

&gt;We helped rebuild the country with the Marshall Plan

This is one reason why. Yes the marshall plan was important and it was a sign of good will and helped all of europe, especially us germans morally, that better times are now ahead. But you didn't really rebuild anything. The marshalplan was 1% of our gdp (1,4 billion) at the time. Over 5 years.
I'm not saying that i'm not greatfull or denying any contribution, but having to constantly read how the US bascially saved europe on their own is just so tiering. 
 It is this constant gloryfication, this constant pointing out how great you are and what good you have done for us in the past. 

&gt; by opening up our markets to it.

Well after allowing germany to becoming a ""State"" again (under your influence), I would count it more as an Capitalistic nessecity. It was as benfeicial for you as it was  for us. Not to meantion that  West and east germany were to be the shining examples which idiologie is superior, Communism or Capitalism.

&gt;We browbeat France into recouncilation with it after the War, both economically &amp; militarily, and then aggressively backed European integration which paved the way for Germany being re-accepted back into the fold politically.

Well, most people also went to school and learned what the allies  actually had in plan for germany. It's not like we don't know that you planed to make us an agricultural buffer state. Only after it was clear that the USSR wasn't interested in joining an aliance you were actively pushing for our rehabilitation. So while I'm definitly not blaming or juding america for their plans, I think that they were fair considering the circumstances, I don't really buy into america doing the morally right thing, this was 100% in their interest.

&gt;Germany's entire national identity is based around the liberal democracy we helped militarily protect, economically prop up &amp; politically back during the Cold War.

&gt;It's culture has, I hate to say it, been Americanized to such a degree that it makes any Russian influence inconsequencial.

Uhhm, while this is actually not wrong, this has more to do with russia being infulenced by german culture than the other way around.

Their whole westernisation that started under peter the great, the vast amount of german immigrants that went to russia at the time shaped their county. Catherin the great became zar, after her husband made a retared peace with prussia, because he was a big  fan of prussia. She also brought many policies with her like the enlightened absolutism. Many big russian cities at the time had rather big german minorites (or rather from the holy roman empire), like in Moskau or in Skt. Petersburg. 
Not to mention Russias support of prussia and austria in the napolionic wars, or later on prussias support of russia in the krim wars. The only real divide between germany and russia was after Bismarck, who himslef was always pro russia, Wilhelm in his surge for glory abandoned them.
But even in WWI we had huge influence on their idiologies, their socialist reforms are basically based on a german. After WWII we were divided and while the west was definitly more poropseros it is not the socialist influence didn't leave us to this day. A lot of people are aposed to predatory capitalism, which many people, including me, see america as the reason for. 

You also misjudge how many russians do live in germany. In highschool I had at least 2 people in my class who where partly russians. 

There are a lot of culural ties between the two countries, that are centutires old and it would be foolish to think they are straight up not important.

&gt;Because, from where I'm sitting, I feel like we're the best ally Germany could've ever fucking hoped for in it's entire history if truly values liberal democracy &amp; prosperity for a unified &amp; soviergn country

....

&gt;the decades long presence of American soldiers in the country

I somhow think this is contradicting each other.

&gt;Our cultural connection is undeniable thanks to not only Hollywood's influence

Yeah, it's just fucking great to watch another movies that states how much the americans sacreficed in WWII and how much of big of a hero you were.
I'm sorry , but as someone who studied a bit of histroy, it is really tiresome to watch yet another movie or see nother game on the markte  the over-glorificates your acomplishments. 

Not that I'm not denying any of you accomplishments in WWII, I think you had a crushal part in it, espcially econmically.

&gt;But yet, despite ALL OF THAT, we're still relegated to being ""just as bad as Russia""

Yes because in the end you are also ruled by a tiny elite that is just in for the benifit themselfes. Your country is the fountian of predatory capitalism, that is infesting the world. The rich get richer and poor just poorer. And this is just spuring over to us, 20 years ago we had a rather nice system which actually was something like super social neo-libarism (Soziale Markwitschaft - social marketeconomy). And while other countrys try to somehow encounter it, you vote for someone like trump, who embodies lobbyism and curruption. I agrre that russia is definiteley not better , but at least you could say that they had a good reason for choosing putin, since he did made their lifes better, at least at the beginning. 


I think we are far more socially focussed than you amercains are and the russians, or rather the USSR embodied some of it.
I'm by no means prasing the USSR as a whole or whishing them back, or their corrupt version of communism that was no better than facsim and in fact was just another tolitarian regime. The USSR and their ""Communism"" disgust me to be quite honest.

This dosn't mean I hate america. I for example have mad respect for Obama to this day, I think he was one of the best presidents period, and I'm still sad he is gone. I'm also aware that a large mayority of americans were germans, alot of german mercanaries (Hessians) helped you calim your freedom, your military was built around prussian tradition and bismarck was for example quite found of lincoln. So we do have a lot of ties, even though we dont't really live them out anymore, sadly.

 Waht can I say, I just feed really conflicted about your country.
Yes Russia made some real asshole moves and you america did also do a lot of good things in the past not denying this. But it feels like we are all now caged in a system that is led by you, and you sadly are not able to refine it.

You may not remember the early 90's and Anguita, but he was imho the best politician we ever had while in democracy. And it's a bit odd that he was considered as such back in the day yet he got very little votes. Perhaps his roots at the PC made people ""vote more conservatively"" but regardless, i find that a bit ironic.

Anyway, if you don't mind, i'm pretty screwed already since i'm under fire from both sides so look for someone else to convince. You may find someone more reasonable than me.

&gt; It is further argued here that the term identicide (from the Latin words identitas (identity) and caedes
(destruction), [Meharg 2006]) is a more appropriate term for these intentioferential cases of mass
violence than genocide. Identicide and genocide are substantively fairly interchangeable; any genus
(e.g. an ethnic, religious etc. community) is represented by a common tier within the complex
identities of its members. However, genocide seems less appropriate, because the term was coined as
‘the crime of genocide’ [Jones 2006], and is as such heavily politically charged. It seems difficult to
prove that in the Late Republic these occurrences of mass violence were perceived as crimes.",,/r/europe/comments/7am2dg/i_think_ive_got_it_guys_the_perfect_solution_for/dpbtfbn/,FrenchFishies,1509783584

1176,"&gt;especially after this madness they have done.

So let me get this straight: Catalans vote in 2006 for more autonomy and more financial independence within Spain (i.e. retaining more money in Catalonia instead of redistributing that same money around other parts of Spain), then they get this right denied and you like it or not the independence movement as a consequence starts growing, thanks to politicians, blah, blah, blah, and then, after all of this mess we've been through, the solution is to ""leave things as they were before"". 

IMHO, I don't think that's how we solve the issue. I think the solution must be achieved by changing Spain completely first in the political side of things. If you have corrupt politicians in those poor regions, no matter what you do, this money will not get redistributed properly and thus you kinda loose your argument about the whole redistributing thigie.

Tell that to us, valencians. We are poor compared to those rich parts of Spain and yet we receive the least amount of money in the whole country from the central government.

-- *Fahrenheit 451*

That being said, for a less-grim take...*Fahrenheit 451* was published in 1953, and might have been complaining about the rise of radio or television compared to the newspaper:

&gt;Without turning on the light he imagined how this room would look. His wife stretched on the bed, uncovered and cold, like a body displayed on the lid of a tomb, her eyes fixed to the ceiling by invisible threads of steel, immovable. And in her ears the little Seashells, the thimble radios tamped tight, and an electronic ocean of sound, of music and talk and music and talk coming in, 
coming in on the shore of her unsleeping mind. The room was indeed empty. Every night the waves came in and bore her off on their great tides of sound, floating her, wide-eyed, toward morning. There had been no night in the last two years that Mildred had not swum that sea, had not gladly gone down in it for the third time.

*Fahrenheit 451* reads like a condemnation of society's shift away from the written word, and away from interpersonal, human interaction towards mass, broadcast media.

However, that isn't quite what's happening today.  Radio peaked long ago, and it looks like in both the [US](https://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/03/nielsen-reports-a-decline-in-television-viewing/) and [UK](http://informitv.com/2015/08/09/uk-traditional-television-viewing-declines/), television use peaked in 2010.  Internet use is growing.  And [the largest chunk of that is social media](http://blog.globalwebindex.net/chart-of-the-day/social-media-captures-30-of-online-time/), of which I suspect most is written, and is interpersonal.

So I guess...people like us here on Reddit, as well as people on Facebook and other places are, a century past broadcast media's rise, reversing the shift away from the written word, and away from being passive consumers of broadcast content.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/7an4gg/the_most_popular_newspaper_in_each_european/dpbrbsw/,vokegaf,1509777465

1283,"&gt;Peters set out his proposals for a CCER in a speech in February 2016, in which he said he hoped the UK would leave the EU to “heal a rift” with NZ that occurred when the UK joined the EEC.

Sounds like the New Zealand Foreign Minister was not super-enthusiastic about the EEC.

&gt;He noted that Boris Johnson had backed a migration agreement between the UK, NZ, Australia and Canada, suggesting that a future migration agreement between these four countries could be based on the current Trans-Tasman Travel Agreement (the agreement between Australia and NZ that allows an automatic right to live and work).

Note that when you open the gates to free movement, people tend to shift towards places with higher wages.  Wikipedia says that in the period since the [Trans-Tasman Travel Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-Tasman_Travel_Arrangement) was signed, there [has been a constant flow from New Zealand to the wealthier Australia](http://www.stats.govt.nz/browse_for_stats/population/Migration/international-travel-and-migration-articles/kiwi-exodus-australia.aspx).

&gt; The dominant historical flow of migrants across the Tasman is New Zealand citizens moving from New Zealand to Australia. This averaged 27,600 a year from the year ended June 1979 to 2016...

[Among these four countries](
http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/topics/income/):

|Country|Population|Average Household Net Adjusted Disposable Income per Capita (USD)|
|-|-:|-:|
|Australia|24,704,000|$33,138|
|Canada|35,151,728|$30,474|
|New Zealand|4,831,110|$29,016|
|United Kingdom|65,648,000|$26,687|

If that happens, I'd expect to see the UK tend to lose population to Australia, though the differences on the whole are not huge (as I've commented before, certain fields do have very large differences, like pay for medical doctors).

&gt;Peters also dismissed a trade deal with the EU as a “fiction”...

Huh.

&gt; ...and said it had been a mistake for NZ to show solidarity with Europe in restricting trade with Russia.  Instead, Peters said NZ should do a new free trade deal with Russia. (Indeed, the Coalition agreement includes a commitment to “work towards a Free Trade Agreement with the Russia-Belarus-Kazakhstan Customs Union.)

Hmm.  I'm suspicious that this is the FM showing solidarity with the UK for political reasons, because the value for establishing trade with Russia don't add up here for me.  New Zealand [didn't do much trade with Russia even back before the whole sanctions business](http://www.stats.govt.nz/browse_for_stats/snapshots-of-nz/nz-in-profile-2013/main-trading-partners.aspx).  Germany alone is more-important from New Zealand's standpoint than Russia.  Ditto for Australia.  Canada overwhelmingly trades with the US (north of half-a-trillion USD in trade a year), with the EU a bit under a quarter that and Russia at only $2.7 billion even before the sanctions business.  And I'm assuming that both the EU and the US would like to retain the Russia sanctions.

It *is* more advantageous to trade with a country that's being sanctioned, because you can be an alternate supplier and destination for goods.

Canada, UK, Australia all have far stricter rules for entry too. 

2. One thing the Trump camp is *not* wrong *::uncontrollably vomits::* about is the fact that Germany's refugees are actually migrants more than asylum seekers meaning they have a home, it's just not full of hope like the Western world. But chances of life, kids, education, etc are there - it's just less than ideal. That doesn't make them a refugee thus they shouldn't be called that, they should be called a migrant.

That's a western european culture kind of thing and it is very much connected to wealth, civilization and also partly religion. Going to Denmark or Sweden or Austria or France etc. is not too different at all. 

Of course german culture exists and I for once have actually watched numerous films from Weimar Germany and also from the new German cinema movement in the 60's &amp; 70's (I've seen 30+ films from Werner Herzog alone), I've read Goethe, Rilke, Schiller, von Kleist, Hölderlin, Mann, etc. in my sparetime, I love the romanticist paintings, especially from Friedrich and I adore expressionism (especially Marc and Nolte among the painters), I adore our composers (Beethoven &amp; Schönberg &amp; Bach, etc.) but also Can and Popol Vuh and Klaus Schulze but the people who cry about the downfall of German culture care horeshit about all that, that's the real irony here and that's what he is trying to say, it'll slowly fade because nobody bloody damn cares and that's sad. The consensus is that German movies are shit, people most definitely not read Goethe in their sparetime if they read at all, nobody cares about paintings and many people would be hard pressed to name German bands besides Rammstein and maybe one or two local bands.

It was Roman in that sense that it followed the Papcy and Rome, as for being an empire, lands stretching from North Italy to France and germany is quite a large kingdom if not empire as to how many different cultures and people he ruled. 

And the arguments still hold to after Charlemagne. The amount of bishoprics and princes that followed the Catholic church made the HRE holy, hell the bloody thirty years war fought over religion was in the HRE, the HRE continued to follow Rome and the Pope up until Charles V and the Reformation. The only thing that the HRE wasn't, was an empire at that point. the lack of control the emperor had over the dozens of princes made it more of a titular title than anything.

1348,"There are four EU overseas territories in the Pacific:

|Territory|Administering EU Member|Population|Area ( km^2 )|
|-|-|-:|-:|
|[New Caledonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Caledonia)|France|268,767|18,576|
|[French Polynesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Polynesia)|France|280,208|4,167|
|[Pitcairn Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcairn_Islands)|UK|57|47|
|[Wallis and Futuna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallis_and_Futuna)|France|11,899|142|

If New Caledonia leaves, unless it opts to join the EU as an independent country (lot of that going around...), that will be the bulk of the EU OCT land in the Pacific, and about half the Pacific population.

It [sounds like the economic impact on New Caledonia of independence would be substantial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Caledonia).

&gt; Financial support from France is substantial, representing more than 15% of the GDP, and contributes to the health of the economy

I assume that that would end.

It also sounds like [a large chunk of trade is with the EU, and currently enjoys tariff-free status](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_member_state_territories_and_the_European_Union):

&gt; The OCTs are not subject to the EU's common external customs tariffs[15] but may claim customs on goods imported from the EU on a non-discriminatory basis.

Obviously, if there's a will in the EU to change that, it could do so, but I'd assume that by default, dependent territories becoming independent lose that status.

[The CIA says that New Caledonia imports a quarter of its imports from France](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/nc.html).  Most exports go to East Asia (60.8% to China, Japan, and South Korea, so any tariffs to the EU may not be a big deal, with France and Belgium being another 9.5% of exports).  Wikipedia says that it's a major nickel exporter, so I assume that the China exports are mostly that:

&gt; With the annual production of about 107,000 tonnes in 2009, New Caledonia was the world's fifth largest producer after Russia (266,000), Indonesia (189,000), Canada (181,000) and Australia (167,000).[3] In recent years, the economy has suffered because of depressed international demand for nickel, due to the ongoing global financial crisis. Only a negligible amount of the land is suitable for cultivation, and food accounts for about 20% of imports. In addition to nickel, the substantial financial support from France and tourism are keys to the health of the economy. In the 2000s, large additions were made to nickel mining capacity. The Goro Nickel Plant is expected to be one of the largest nickel producing plants on Earth.

It sounds like the issue of independence has been fairly contentious, but that presently, a [substantial majority are opposed to independence](http://www.radionz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/330754/new-caledonia-majority-against-independence-poll):

&gt;An opinion poll in New Caledonia has found that 54 percent of eligible voters are against independence from France.
&gt;
&gt; The poll was carried out I-Scope on behalf of the Caledonia television station in late March and early April but its findings were not released until after the French presidential election.
&gt;
&gt; The poll also found that just under a quarter of respondents are for independence.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/7aonks/french_territory_new_caledonia_to_hold_referendum/dpbpg7p/,vokegaf,1509773017

Inditex has been doing what is considered legal tax avoidance by tunneling their European revenue via Netherlands, Ireland and Switzerland resulting in a corporate income tax rate of 23%. Ikea, company famous for heavy tax planning and complicated corporate structure still paid 822 million corporate income tax with 23% average.

In comparison Apple has been tunneling money from Europe, Middle East, and Africa since 1992 to Ireland. The problem is that the effective tax rate is not even close to the 12.5% Irish corporate tax rate, but rather somewhere between 0.005% to 2%. That's clear preferential treatment and against the EU law.

I think many Americans forget that on the long run 14 billion going into EU pockets wont change anything. Hell, VW Group has paid 14 billion (almost all to US, it's 4th largest sales region) for the dieselgate and they are doing profit and sales wise better than ever before. With the Apple case that will be 5% of the net cash reserves resting in Europe. The only reason by far most of Apple's whole net cash reserves rest in Europe is because of these tax deals.

Less than three miles from my home, there's a 1 acre plot on which 20 static caravans, [just like these](https://media.pitchup.co.uk/images/4/image/private/s--i7cNYP98--/c_limit,h_1350,w_1800/e_improve,fl_progressive/q_50/b_rgb:000,g_south_west,l_pu_logo_white_vcbkgt,o_25/v1423735888/quantock-orchard-caravan-park/example-of-ou-static-caravan_superior-4-6-berth-static-caravan.jpg), are situated. There are between 10-12 Polish guys living in each one. If you want to work for the farmer, you have to live in his caravans. It's very common practise. This way he can pay you £1,300pm, but recoup £200pm through rent, and all he has to do is provide very poor quality accommodation.

1430,"&gt; I swear Germans (the translated writings of whom the majority of the linked article is based around &amp; referencing) stay on this East German-borne, Eurasian pointed, Russian circlejerking bullshit. Russia fucked &amp; backstabbed Clinton, it fucked &amp; backstabbed Bush, it fucked &amp; backedstabbed Obama and it'll eventually fuck &amp; backstab the German elite too. Hell, the latter two American Presidents even did a big ""re-start"" shtick, and the former even pulled a whole ""new friendship for a new age shit"". 

Watch your ideology, dude. There are very much capazities to how popular Russia is with the general population here, in fact I don't know many countries that are viewed more negatively by the general population. The sentiment of many people is merely that we want peaceful relations and no escalation &amp; isolation politics (because that way we're breeding a monster) but Americans get extremely worked up about that. What exactly are you saying they will backstab us with? We have no close diplomatic ties with them, we know their government is a quasi dictatorship, we know their government isn't trustworthy but what exactly have we trusted them with? We're basicly doing buisness and that's it. Their leverage to economically threaten us is relatively limited, they have gas, sure but there are other markets and right now Russia is very happy to do buisness with anyone. 

&gt; I swear, listening to anti-Atlanticist Germans critisize us for being ""pretentious"" is hilarious. The German elite have their head so far up their own asshole that they didn't even realize pushing Ukraine to sign a Association agreement with the EU would cause Russia to invade, since they probably figured that Russia knew they could ""work with"" them at the expense of American influence (probably willfully blind to the fact that Russia likely considers the growth of German influence at the expense of Russian, especially in relation to Ukraine &amp; their planned Eurasian Union, to be just as threatening despite the German elite's delusions).

Ukraine was handled poorly from both Nato and EU, yeah.

Dafuq? Is this where the weapon lobby propaganda comes, ""you have to spend 2 % of your GDP because then we can all kill ourselves with some even mightier explosions"". That's some mighty bullshit right there. If Germany were to spend 2 % of its GDP we would match freaking Russian spending by ourselves. Putin isn't going to invade Poland, Romania or the baltics because he knows it's delusional. He knew his cards with Crimea, he played them, now the situation is on ice. Should Putin invade the Baltics or even the rest of Ukraine (which he won't but I promise you, the guy who will follow Putin will be 10 times worse if we already run around and propagate Russia as the enemy now and with a new hyper-nationalist president I'm not sure anymore if that wouldn't end in WW III), he will create a new source of mass nationalist terrorism in Russia. I don't think that's his goal. He could annex Crimea because Crimea is actually majority Russian, doesn't go as well with other regions.

1456,"First of all thanks for the interesting run down on the the whole situation.

I think that the main problem is not with Agrokor going down per se, but the, as you said, profitable subsidiaries such as Ledo etc. going down with it. Not to mention all the suppliers from the agricultural and manufacturing sector for whom Agrokor is a vital buyer. Them going down down spells economic disaster in capital and bold letters.

With regards to Mercator, AFAIK they signed a 2 year (?) contract that forbids Agrokor from meddling in Mercator's financial affairs and other stuff, so maaaybe we're safe from financial machinations from Agrokor and the banks, but I really ain't on speed at the whole situation, so who knows really. 

Once again, I really hope you can find a way to save your agroindustrial sector, because AFAIK a lot of it is tied up in Agrokor. We blew it all in the years preceding the recession with management buyouts that consolidated our agro-industry with nauseating debts that bursted with the global recession. A lot of these firms were then bought by foreign firms on overwhelmingly undervalued terms. Mercator was just one of them, Droga Kolinska was bought by Atlantic Grupa, Pivovarna Laško (which includes most of the Slovenian drinks industry) was bought by Heineken and Fructal by some Serbian firm. I'm all for trade and the EU, but a lot of our alleged national champions were bought for pennies and while it seemed prudent at the time, I just can't help but lament the foolishness that resulted from all of this. 


For example, and no offence to Croatia at all, but 5 years ago, Mercator always had most of its branded products Slovenian. Meat was mostly Slovenian and Slovenian products were prioritized. Which I think is beneficial, as we're a small country and our agro-industry lives or dies on the whim of retailers. But as soon as Agrokor bought Mercator, guess what. Croatian products everywhere! Pik Vrbovac is everywhere, also Ledo, Podravka, pushing domestic products off the aisles. The catch is we had a lot of them them before, only now they cancelled competing products from smaller grocery stores plus introducing new Croatian ones. And I think that's not healthy for our economy as it shrinks competition and forces us into buying a select producer. Not to mention it clearly cuts of Slovenian producers, which are a part of our nation's economic tale (to put it romantically). Seriously, I can buy more Slovenian products from Hofer than Mercator and that says a lot about the state of our retailers.

And just an appendix: in the end of the day, if the nationality of the product in question doesn't matter, the transportation costs do, that's why I rather buy locally (or nationaly - we're a small nation) produced products, as they stress the environment a lot less than stuff produced a 1000 km away. Hofer does great marketing with milk produced allegedly from Slovenia. The cows from which the milk is procured are from Slovenia, but the milk is then shipped to some part of Austria for processing and then reshipped to Slovenia for retail. It's cheap, sure. But tell me that it has less of an effect on the environment than milk from our local Ljubljanske Mlekarne.

In my opinion some Germans have a somewhat romantic view of Russia or at least think that Germany is the Western European country most similar to Russia. So it's assumed that Russians are more sympathetic towards Germany than other European countries. There is also this sentiment of the USA being ""just as bad"" as Russia when confronted with Russian aggression etc.

And - it's not just oil, but also gas. Idk if you were following, but Kolinda started moseying around Poland and USA for the Three Seas Initiative, connecting the EU periphery vertically (which I actually support), building LNG terminals so that the east gets less reliant on Russia and makes some money, etc etc. And Croatia was perfect for that because: a) Rijeka/Krk and b) we're already not-that-dependent on Russia because we told them to get lost after they withheld gas delivery that one winter, some slapfight with Ukraine.

Next, Agrokor goes into crisis. The Russian bankers appear very *interested* in taking over their share of the company. (That money is... not that relevant to Russia. But the economic influence on Western Balkan through this octopus? Another story.) But our government intervenes and takes over the management. They get a new cash-injection from some American vulture fund. Russian bankers appear displeased.

Next, our biggest gas company ""incidentally"" makes a new deal with Gazprom for 10-year-delivery. Kolinda runs to Vladimir with distinguished Croatian businessmen, lots of pics are taken, etc etc. And now this stuff with oil, some Russian mini-boss promising to rescue our Sisak refinery from MOL's mismanagement and modernize INA *if only we'd let him do it.*

Yeah... interesting times here \^^

&amp;nbsp;

Now, as for the situation itself~

Some parts of the company are being sold off already. The debts that go beyond the value of the company-property are around 2 billion dollars... so compared to our 50-billion-GDP it's not so much, but I *think* a great(er) danger is the debtors suing us if they're not happy with how the restructuring/resolution goes.

In that sense, you lot should also be careful with nationalizing Mercator, because if Mercator vouched for Konzum's debts for example (and it probably did, that's our problem with most of Agrokor, Jamnica/Ledo/Belje/etc are doing good/OK business but STILL drowning because of Konzum/Tisak/etc), and then the debt-seekers can't get their money back from Mercator (or Agrokor in general, but again, that depends on what Mercator's management signed), then they can sue the State of Slovenia.

Here we're walking a thin line with this government intervention, technically Agrokor is still a private company in a legal sense, politicians basically voted in a new law to take over management so that company doesn't go under with domino-effects, old management couldn't be trusted (and it really couldn't, *Ivica cooked the books*), etc etc, but... it's a grey area, legally speaking.

lol
&gt;During the Kosovo War, **over 90,000 Serbian and other non-Albanian refugees fled the war-torn province.** **In the days after the Yugoslav Army withdrew**, **over 200,000 (over half) Serb and other non-Albanians civilians were expelled from Kosovo and many of the remaining civilians were victims of abuse.**[78][79][80][81][82] After Kosovo and other Yugoslav Wars, Serbia became home to the highest number of refugees and IDPs (including Kosovo Serbs) in Europe.[83][84][85]
In 2000, German war photographer Frauke Eigen created an exhibition about the clothing and belongings of the victims of ethnic cleansing in the Kosovo War.[86] Eigen's photographs were taken onsite during the exhumation of mass graves, and were later used as evidence by the War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague.[87]
**According to a 2001 report by Human Rights Watch (HRW):**
The KLA was responsible for serious abuses... including abductions and murders of Serbs and ethnic Albanians considered collaborators with the state. **Elements of the KLA are also responsible for post-conflict attacks on Serbs, Roma, and other non-Albanians, as well as ethnic Albanian political rivals... widespread and systematic burning and looting of homes belonging to Serbs, Roma, and other minorities and the destruction of Orthodox churches and monasteries... combined with harassment and intimidation designed to force people from their homes and communities... elements of the KLA are clearly responsible for many of these crimes.**
**In 2007, tens of thousands of Serbs were preparing to flee the province of Kosovo, packing their bags, fearing a new wave of ""ethnic cleansing"" at the hands of the Kosovo's new Albanian-led administration.**

Also, in this case, there should be a third referendum in the new size-reduced Spain, asking people if they want Catalonia in the EU. If “no” wins, Spain should place a permanent veto to Catalonia.

1729,"What, you think that the aim is to export to Vietnam without permitting imports from Vietnam?

In the long run, a trade equilibrium will always form.  [Europe figured that out hundreds of years ago when it dropped mercantilism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercantilism).

Let's say that there are only the EU and you you ban imports from Vietnam to the EU, but you permit exports from the EU to Vietnam.  ""Ah *hah*"", you think, ""now European companies are winning!  The EU is better off""

What will happen is that European wages will rise relative to Vietnamese wages.  That might *sound* good to you — after all, high wages sound nice, right?  Thing is, the only goods you can buy with those wages are…made in Europe, by those increasingly-expensive workers.  Your wages aren't going any further, because real prices in stores are rising — they won't buy you more bread or automobiles than before.  Eventually, prices for European-made goods become so high that Vietnamese can't afford to import them and EU exports dwindle to a halt, and the two entities operate in isolation.

This is economically-inefficient in that neither side can leverage [comparative advantage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_advantage) present in the other side's economy, which means that in real terms, in terms of the things that you can buy, both economies are worse-off overall than they otherwise would have been.

Now, in the real world, there are some caveats.  Given that both the Eurozone's euro and the Vietnamese dong float relative to each other, don't have a fixed exchange rate, some of that would be expressed via the euro rising relative to the dong, rather than just euro prices skyrocketing.

Additionally, in the real world, there are other countries.  So if you block imports from Vietnam, but permit imports from the US, the US will import goods from Vietnam, take some of the trade benefit that would otherwise have accrued to the EU, and then export US goods to the EU, leveraging the edge given US labor and companies given by having access to resources that European companies are prevented from having.  Like, if I can import cheap Vietnamese-made shoes, my US employer pays me more in terms of shoe-buying power than would otherwise have been the case, even without giving me more dollars.  And EU employers have to compete with that, with their own wages not going as far.

What you wind up with is a [trade triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_trade), where the US will tend to the EU, the EU will tend to export to Vietnam, and Vietnam will tend to export to the US, with the EU on the net worse off than if it had had just permitted imports from Vietnam in the first place.

Broadly-speaking, countries want to engage in trade when they can.  There are other concerns, and sometimes they override the reasons to engage in trade, but as a rule of thumb, trade is beneficial.  It's why sanctions have bite…",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/7aickd/lse_brexit_the_eu_isnt_protectionist_its_one_of/dpb08xd/,vokegaf,1509739916

You probably should.

You can't fabricate money from thin air.  Protectionism just transfers it from one pocket to the other.  So if you, say, disallow import of steel, you transfer funds from industries that use steel, like the auto industry, to the steel industry.  Weakening one, strengthening the other, and weakening the whole a bit by adding economic inefficiency.

Sure, it's great for investors and workers in the steel industry.  But it's just as crummy for workers and investors in the auto industry.

1865,"&gt; Why the hell would you want the symbol of tyranny and oppression to stay?

I don't think monarchies are symbols of tyranny or oppression in the red countries in this map. There's one bad apple in a line somewhere, a revolution happens and suddenly all kings and queens are tyrants and oppressors. That's a very black and white worldview, if I'm being honest.

&gt; Should Germany have Hitler Jr. as a symbolic head of state with no powers? 

Not sure what Hitler has to do with this. 

 I can't see how choosing someone to do a job just because they were born with a golden spoon in their ass is better than electing one.

Because such a person has been prepared for such a task for his whole life, and comes from a line of people who had to do this before him/her. Can't mess up and leave after a few years, leaving the mess to be cleaned up by the next guy.

nd not to mention it's expensive as fuck to keep up their royal lifestyle with all the castles, ceremonies and whatnot. 

They bring in money through tourism, and exclusive trade deals. 

And let's be realistic, if you're a country that does all the fancy ceremonies and stuff, that won't end if you swap one symbolic figurehead for another. Look at the US, for example.

Just giving the viewpoint of someone from a monarchy here. 

Main point is: being a dick isn't exclusive to monarchs. At least you can be sure that if you have a monarch that isn't a dick, you won't have a figurehead that is also a dick for a *long* time, and chances are his/her successor isn't either. (Can't say that for presidents, who change regularly and not being a dick isn't a criteria nor prevents you from being elected, sadly.)

And if they happen to be then we'd just depose them if we felt like it. As a local example, the Dutch king said he wants to be a modern king and would step down if that was asked. These days most European monarchs definitely know to behave or they'll be happily replaced with a republic. In turn, they do their best and for that, they are well liked.

Their population dropped 90% in the 1500’s due to European diseases, 100 years before the English ever came into contact with them. The reason there were more indigenous people in Spanish colonies is 1) They didn’t establish ‘The United States Of America’ they left before establishing a solid country and expanding 2) They raped/consensually had sex with a lot of natives, thus offspring(check the link provided as to why) 3) Latin American natives were not nomadic and insanely sparse like the plains indians etc. Not saying American treated them well, or that they even cared about them. But they were simply already wiped out by the time we got there and Americans and Spaniards had differing beliefs in how to deal with Natives.

Ilona and Piotr Kwiatkowscy from Hamburg expect the Polish government to help recover the 10-month-old daughter Marcelina, which was taken by the Jugendamt in mid-October this year. ""Polish politicians can help us, they just need them,"" the girl's father said.

Marcelina was taken away by two representatives of the Hamburg Youth Office (Jugendamtu) on October 15th. in the absence of her mother and father. According to the grandmother's family taking care of the girl during the incident she was to be mauled. They arrived at the police station to explain that the child would be given if the mother did not return home.

7 thousand euros for staying in a shelter

""The Jugendamt accuses us of being an incompatible marriage. We do not know on which basis we were charged, ""said Piotr Kwiatkowski's father. ""They say we're bad parents for our daughter, but not for the two older children we have,"" he added.

""I'm a husband and I know what marriage is. I want to protect all my children and my wife. In the Jugendamt they try to separate us, my wife was hired to divorce me and move home to single mothers, ""he said. He added that the Jugendamt asked the family to pay a bill of 7,000. euro for a month's stay in a child's shelter.

Kwiatkowski looks forward to the help of the Polish government in recovering his daughter. - I think Polish politicians can help us, they just want to. President Andrzej Duda is my president. He is a Pole and I am a Pole, and he should help us, show us that we are one, ""he remarked.

The Polish Association of Parents Against Discrimination Against Children in Germany, to which the Kwiatkowski family appealed, helped in filing a complaint with the German prosecutor's office about the crime.

District spokesman Altona Martin Roehl said that because of the good of the child can not address the specific issue of the Kwiatkowskis state. ""The Jugendamt intervenes only if the life or health of the child is in immediate danger,"" he said. The decision to take the baby is ""the last resort, it's the ultima ratio for us,"" he added.

Complaints were already affecting the European Parliament

Vice-President of the Parents Against Discrimination Against Children in Germany Klaus-Uwe Kirchhoff said he was in the process of analyzing the case. Noting that it was only preliminary findings, he pointed out the brutal intervention of the Jugendamt's representatives. In his opinion, the German police have negatively assessed the conduct of the Jugendamt. ""The police have behaved well,"" said Kirchhoff, a former employee of the youth office.

The European Parliament's petition committee adopted a critical report on the Jugendamt a few years ago. The Commission investigated complaints from parents from different EU countries who accused the Jugendamt of obstructing or even preventing them from contacting the child in cases where the court has granted parental access under supervision.

In Poland loudly the cases of divorced Poles living in Germany were complained, who complained that German institutions prevented them from using the Polish language during supervised meetings with children. Similar problems were reported by parents in France and Italy.

The Jugendamas were created in the 1920s as an institution for the care of difficult youth, depraved as a result of the war. After coming to power in 1933, the Nazis included the network of these institutions into their educational system. At present the activities of the youth offices are under the control of the German federal states. In cases where babies are neglected or mistreated by their caregivers, the Jugendamas are often criticized for their sluggishness and lack of determination. On the other hand, they are accused of interfering in family life and privacy.",Poland,/r/europe/comments/7akd0q/jugendamt_took_their_daughter_call_for_help_to/dpalkn8/,Tartyron,1509725256

I don't know. I think the Scottish ""settlement"" seems unfinished and semi ad-hoc. But that's the British way so probably not bad for now.

So far the UK has pretty much done all the big things right. If Brexit had gone Remain I'd don't think there'd be any serious talk of another indyref.

Hrvatski enciklopedijski rječnik is incorrect then (Hungarian a doesn't result in o &gt; pandur, baršun, gazda, bitanga, hajduk, karika, aldomaš, orsag)

According to Miklošić's etymological dictionary of Slavic languages, and Petar Skok's Etymological dictionary, and ЭТИМОЛОГИЧЕСКИЙ СЛОВАРЬ СЛАВЯНСКИХ языков, and even [online Slovenian dictionary](http://www.fran.si/193/marko-snoj-slovenski-etimoloski-slovar/4289482/oblk?View=1&amp;Query=oblok&amp;All=oblok) [oblȍk -ọ́ka m lat.‛arcus’, star. tudi ‛okno’ (18. stol.)] marks the word proto-Slavic, and not as Hungarian loanword. 

The only thing we can discuss is whether the word is derived from adjective with suffix - ok (Skok, Miklošić) or the word is from lǫkъ 'arch' with prefix ob- (Russian, and Slovenian online dictionary). The problem I have with the latter etymology is that the back nasal sound ǫ in Slovak should result in u, not o, but the word is attest as [oblok](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/oblok), not obluk. In kajkavian ǫ can result in both o and u. 


Plus, Slavic o can become a in Hungarian: pandur &lt; pǫdar, parlag &lt; prělog, gazda &lt; gospoda (gostьpoda), and considering that in Hungarian word ablak there's no n, we can only conclude that either the Hungarian word is of newer origin when Slavs stopped pronouncing nasal sounds, or ǫ never existed.

Didn't avoid if Kosovo existed, but a achieved statehood. Which is a rather ""vague"" term. However if Kosovo did not exist, there would be no ruling to consider. So definitely the ICJ recognised them as existing. If they were a state is another question.

&gt;According to Thomas D. Musgrave, Self-determination and national minorities (Oxford Monographs in International Law, Oxford University Press, 2000) p. 235 n. 170, in 1991 the Badinter Arbitration Committee of the European Union used the following definition of the state:

&gt;In Opinion No. 1 the Commission had noted, at p. 1495, that ""the State is commonly defined as a community which consists of a territory and a population subject to an organized political authority; that such a state is characterized by sovereignty.

Or the 1933 ""Montevideo Convention on the Rights and Duties of States"".

&gt;The state as a person of international law should possess the following qualifications: (a) a permanent population; (b) a defined territory; (c) government; and (d) capacity to enter into relations with the other states.

2046,"&gt;Ok, right back at you. There's a thousand different ways to combine family and career, and political decisions can heavily influence the impact one has on the other. How well do tertiary education and having a child go together? 

Then compare education levels, not the average wage regardless of fields...

&gt;What's the day care situation look like and how well protected are women by law?

Then compare the daycare situation and labour law, not the average wage regardless of fields...

&gt;How often do men stay home instead?

Then compare paternity leave with maternity leave, not the average wage regardless of fields...

&gt;Who has kids when and how does that impact their career, and vice versa?

Then compare average age at first child, not the average wage regardless of fields...

&gt;A women that had kids with 20 and started working again as a cashier at 35

Now I'm sorry, but this is a personal choice - rather few women leave such a long *gap* in between.

&gt;The statistic might not, but it could have provoked interesting discussion instead of endless moaning about some hoax.

It is a hoax because people are generally idiots and will interpret this the wrong way. This statistic literally doesn't show what it intends to show. 

For Estonia for example I am fairly certain that longer life expectancy *for women* has a strong impact on average wage. If there are many old women in the labour force doing simple service industry jobs, while there are very few men of their age in the labour force, then obviously *women in general* have lower average wages, even if in specific fields for equally qualified workers the gender wage gap might be very small or not exist at all.

This statistic therefore is caused by the opposite of what it intends to show. It shows that women earn less than men on average, while the root cause of this problem is that men live shorter lives on average...",Estonia,/r/europe/comments/7aiirw/eu_gender_pay_gap_how_much_less_do_women_earn/dpaep9y/,h2ppyme,1509718282

If you are portraying your opponents as unfair reactionaries going into exile is actually the thing to do. And historically leaders who do this are not viewed as cowards. (Whether the opponents actually are unfair reactionaries is up for debate). Maybe his actions are an attempt to mirror some Catalan 20th century history: the Catalan president was in exile until 1977. Within current lifetimes.

Not sure how.

&gt;The whole point of the wage gap isn't that women earn less than men in the same field of work, but that they generally work less prestigious/well-paying jobs than men.

This is only part of the problem. For Estonia the real reason is men living shorter lives and there being many older women in the labour force at low-paying service industry jobs, while there being very few older men in the labour force, not bringing the average male wage down that much.

2121,"&gt; EU is so much against nationalism its members will exclude catalonia to save their territorial integrity.

Territorial integrity is not the same as nationalism. I guess you know something about Germany: it's one of the least nationalists countries in the world, they are quite ashamed of their own history (not of their traditions and way of living though), but they want to preserve frontiers. I already told the reason before: in Europe, fighting over frontiers have brought many bloody wars.

&gt; WWII started because people wasn't allowed to re-united their country

WWII had many reasons, and nationalism played a key role. What people weren't allowed to re-unite their country?

&gt; ah, so EU now is not against nationalisms, but against change.

The EU is against repeating the same errors that brought WWII and WWII.

&gt; And catalans wanted to secede peacefully.

Catalans wanted to secede peacefully? Where do you get this from? I can remind you something: the deputies that declared independence in the Parliament of Catalonia, although being a majority, represented only 48% of the voters that had elected that Parliament.

&gt; Nor what Catalan's legal status technically is. But if Puidgemont claims is a citizen of the Catalan Republic I don't think Spain has jurisdiction over him.

The Catalan Republic is not recognized by any country in the world. Not only that, most of the countries in the word had specifically said they don't recognized it. Belgium is one of the few that has no official position yet (no doubt because they have independentists in their own government).

Here it isn't as much a ""crime on moral"", but rather a huge generalization of everything narcotics-labeled as equally bad. I'm not sure exactly when this attitude started brewing, but I think it is founded in several things, one of them being our overzealous view of the state and subsequent  laws as being completely justified. I think this has resulted in a quite one-laned road towards opinions being based on laws and legislative obligations rather than the laws and legislations being based in societal attitudes. If the Swedish state and legislation tells you cannabis-consumption is bad, and subsequent punishment will take form as a consequence of this consumption, the people automatically embrace this view in fear of not being a ""law abiding citizen"". The results of course leads to an extreme amount of unnecessary weight on welfare when individuals get punished for something futile/trivial, thus rendering them less likely to securing a job and more likely to need benefits from the state.

2237,"&gt; Pro-unionists leaders were never interested in talking, only in imposing their own agenda (""you give us more money AND forget about independence"").

In 2012, Artur Mas went to visit Mariano Rajoy, and demanded a new financial system, one that would basically give Catalonia the right to collect all taxes, like Basque Country. He told him that otherwise he would push for a referendum (even if it was not legal) and independence. Rajoy told him at that moment it was not possible, because Spain was going through the worst crisis in many years, and giving Catalonia a system similar to Basque Country would wreck Spain. So Artur Mas went for the referendum. Do you call that negotiation? I call it imposition.

The main nationalist party, CiU, never talked of independence until 2012. Before that, as late as 2011, Artur Mas said he would never back independence because it would break up catalonian society. Which happened. So independence has not been in the table for a long time.

&gt; I really dislike the ""didn't want to talk"" argument. Talk is what has happened for the past 30 years. It is precisely when talks ended in lawsuits that this shitshow started.

No, talks ended when the pro-independence leaders decided to declare independence. What actually happened 2 years ago, when the Catalonian Parliament declared they didn't observe the Spanish Constitution. And in the last two years there were no lawsuits. Lawsuits came when it was clear that pro-independence leaders wanted to fully go ahead with independence. Now it's in the hands of the Justice.

It costs about 30.000 $ per year to house a prisoner in the US for example. The NY terrorist is 29 years old. Average lifespan is 78 years.

That means the guy will have to kept alive for almost 50 years, 50 * 30.000 = 1.500.000 $

And that's just for one guy.

Clearly it would be much, much cheaper to execute him and not allow him to have any appeal process etc.

Additionally, if the legislation could be redesigned to allow executions only in cases where there is absolutely no doubt - video evidence and such and / or a high number of witnesses, I'm sure the politician, lawyers and judges could work something out that is reasonable - and the number of false convictions would be kept to an absolute minimum approaching zero.

That would clearly be worth it as far as I'm concerned. And even if there's a small number of wrongly convicted and executed, the huge amounts of costs that were saved would more than make up for it.

2282,"Your argument doesn't follow from that point. Yes it can be useful to have some sort of ""embodiment of the state"" type of person who rises above the usual politics, but it's demonstrably false that this can't be an elected position.

For example, the president of Iceland [Guðni Th.](https://grapevine.is/news/2017/01/24/satisfaction-with-president-reaches-record-high/) has north of 80% approval ratings and is functionally equivalent to having a king, whereas recent polls in The Netherlands suggest that [only 65% of the electorate](http://www.dutchnews.nl/features/2017/04/11-key-facts-about-dutch-king-willem-alexander-as-he-turns-50/) approves of the monarchy as an institution, nevermind who the king is.

In countries without a monarchy nobody's suggesting to do away with the position of the president, but where there's a monarchy a lot of people find the very idea of inherited government positions to be distasteful, which delegitimizes that part of the government, even though the monarchy may serve a worthwhile political function.

You may also be looking at this with rose-tinted glasses since The Netherlands has been relatively happy with its monarchy in modern times, but the very institution is a timebomb waiting to happen. The next heir to the throne might be more like a Boris Johnson or Donald Trump-like character than the kings or queens you've liked thus far, and unlike with an elected position you'd be stuck with that person for decades instead of just not re-electing them (or more likely, not electing them in the first place).

2375,"&gt; The question is - how serious Catalans are?

The first mistake is to think of Catalonians as one. According to latest polls, people that actually want an independent Catalonia are around 35-40%. 

And, most importantly, the number of deputies that declared Catalonia an independent country last week formed a majority in Parliament, but actually represented only 48% of voters that elected that Parliament 2 years ago. The rest, representing 52%, voted ""NO"" to independence.

&gt; Being democratic or lawful does not mean being right or making good decision.

In a democracy, following laws is vital. Because laws are designed to ensure everyone's rights are respected, specially those of minorities. 

There are means to change the Constitution in Spain. But of course they would require a lot of talking and convincing, which is the way big decisions are made in democracies. And the way things were done in Canada and UK (Quebec and Scotland), btw, which are often cited as examples. And pro-independence leaders were never interested in talking, only in imposing their own agenda.

&gt; It all depends on people now - and no ""law"" , ""rules"" or ""directives"" are relevant in that matter.

That's a dangerous statement. In Nazi Germany, people were against the Jews (because they were manipulated, just like many Catalonians), so it was right to go against them? I hope you say the answer is no. In a democracy, law would have protected those Jews, just like in Spain and the rest of european countries democracy protects the rights of everyone.
And when someone goes against those rights, the state has the right to defend itself. 

&gt; BTW ""selling"" Poland to USSR influence was also fully legal. It does not mean it was ""right""

There was no international legality back then. It was just the will of the most powerful, USSR. ",Spain,/r/europe/comments/7ahzug/what_happens_now_that_puigdemont_has_refused_to/dpa3qgp/,khalast_6669,1509697329

I think the monarchy is important to Canada to keep the American cultural influence at bay, and to help us remain anchored to some sort of past.

American culture is of course very prevalent in Canadian society. When a member of the royal family comes to visit (or on remembrance day, public Christmas events, or Victoria Day) it really does stir something in the soul to have a crowd sing GSTQ with Union Jacks flying. I really do believe that the US and UK cultural and political combination is what makes Canada unique, at least when it comes to the eastern provinces.

Also, modern Canadian identity was more or less invented in the late sixties/early seventies. With an increasingly diverse population, and with that a changing culture, it’s good to be able to hold onto something so distant and yet close to the remnants of what it historically means to be Canadian.

It is a site for exchanging opinion. Poles do not want to exchange anything. 

They like Russia made ""Skrep"" for 1 Massacre and they do not want the truth. Even if all facts against their opinion. They want respect for Poles politics lie. 
 
Massacre
Poles killed Poles. 
Polish government had made a terror for Ukrainian Polish citizens for 20 years. Do you understand that it all was Polish citizens? 
All. 
Poles in Volhynia executed it. 
Then times changed and USSR came and made it own terror.
Than NAZI came and made their terror. 

Than Massacre began. 
Just imagine. What need to happen with you that you will come out of your house and begin to kill neighbors,children, women? 

What needs to happen ? 
It is not easy to do such things. 


Why was Massacre only on Volyhnia? Why? Nowhere only there? Why? That is the main question Poles do not want to answer. 

Because if you made bad thing for 20 years it can happen shit like Massacre. 

Also they all right - 100 000 Poles was killed? Guys it is WW2? on that territory was German (who only in Ukraine killed 2-3 millions of Ukrainian and Jewish peaceful citizens). USSR who did not like nor Poles nor UPA (and also killed millions of peaceful citizens) 

How did you count who killed Poles? how? How do you know that it was UPA ? 

USSR to destroy UPA used such tactics: They took criminals and NKVD soldiers, gave them UPA uniform, sent them to a village, and these guys were ordered to kill citizens. Than everyone in newspapers and just talks know that UPA killed peaceful citizens. How do I know? 

My neighbor was an old guy who when he was in USSR army in UPA uniform killed peaceful citizens in Galicia. 

Next fact Poles do not like - 30000 Ukrainians were killed in the same Massacre by Poles. So people killed people. 

and this happened only Volyhnia. Why? 

All this Massacre story has to many strange elements. 
And the easiest way for countries such USSR and communist Poland, Germany was to cover everything by blaming UPA or OUN-B. Why? Who cares about some this guys? 
 
Because real fact check as for me will give other results of this Massacre and role of USSR and Germany in it. it is much more convenient to cover what you did by writing history. 

Why Poles downvote

Politics. 
Check yourself. Every Pole would say that Bandera made Massacre. 
Hmm... Bandera was in German prison 1941-1945. But every Pole will tell you that. Why? Because of Polish politics every time, when they begin to speak about Massacre, tell name Bandera. 

Facts of this tragedy as for me were changed by USSR, Germany and Poland to cover their crimes in it. 

This was a tragedy - great tragedy of Ukrainian and Polish nations - BOTH. 

What want Poles? They want that Ukrainian need not to heroized UPA ? But UPA was 1939-1957? It fought for Ukraine. for 20 years and it was not only in Volyhnia, it was in whole Ukraine. Some UPA guys made bad things in Volyhnia but there were much more UPA guys who even did not know about that? 
Why not Ukraine then to ask Poland to stop heroized all Polish kings, generals, soldiers in period 1540-1670? It was also Massacre of Ukrainians by Poles? Or in many other periods? 

Massacre 1942-1943. Another strange fact. Why it stops one day? 
Just stopped? why? 

I told and still convinced - All this Massacre story is half lies, which is used by Polish politics to heat Polish nationalists and a bad attitude to Ukraine. Nothing more nothing less. 
Every time when Poland need something from Ukraine they begin in media campaign - Massacre, Bandera, some Polish tombs in Ukraine. ??? Everytime!!!! The same!!! We need to have a policeman near every Polish tomb in Ukraine because everytime Poland want something - something happen to Polish tombs in Ukraine. Do you think we do not have any other things to do only to destroy Polish tombs?

Of course.

The same as Ireland before independence. Prior to 1916 Home Rule (greater autonomy) was the consensus. 1916-1918 changed the consensus. And here we are all these years later with an Irish republic.

&gt; there is no agreement with the central government

There typically isn't. Central governments have a range of options though.

&gt; No reasonable minimum conditions for independence have been met, none whatsoever.

&gt;  el simple hecho de que estén en la cárcel, reconforta a la mayoría de la sociedad española. Da igual el ""porqué"", sino que lo que importa es que estén ahí. Eso da una apariencia de que el Estado funciona y que ""reacciona"" de forma efectiva ante la amenaza secesionista

Si lo entiendo. Soy Español, espero no haber dado la impresion de ""esconderme"" tras la bandera Europea, pero es solamente que un dia me parecio que a lo mejor seria mas facil tener conversaciones en este sub si no iba con la rojigualda por delante. Y bueno, que tampoco es que sea yo muy de banderas.

En esto que dices estoy de acuerdo en gran medida, sobre todo la parte de que el pueblo tiende a regirse mas por sentimientos que por razones. Pero espero que estes de acuerdo que ""ser asi"" es algo tan Español que de esto no os librais los Catalanes tampoco. Llamemosle temperamento Iberico, por dejar de lado las nacionalidades :)

Supongo que ya entenderas por mis comentarios que yo apoyo la decision de Lamela. En principio, reconozco que iba un poco llevado por la marea de pasiones que decribes, pero hoy en dia creo que en su auto expone con claridad sus razones, y yo, desde mi punto de vista totalmente ""laico"" las comparto.

Dicho esto, me he tirado todo el dia con una sensacion muy rara. En teoria, hoy era un dia para que nosotros los ""unionistas"" (adjetivo al que no me acostrumbrare nunca) celebraramos. Pero a mi no me han entrado ningunas ganas de celebrar; es mas, no estoy ni mas contento que ayer, de hecho estoy bastante preocupado y entristecido. Creo que es por darme cuenta de que estos ingresos en prision, por muy justificados que esten juridicamente, no auguran nada bueno para ninguna de las partes. Y que al fin y al cabo son personas normales con sus familias y tal, a los que se les acaba de meter en la carcel. Bastante duro, no me cuesta mucho imaginarme en la misma situacion. 

Solo estoy en desacuerdo con una cosa:

&gt; para la mayoría de la sociedad ... ver a los líderes secesionistas en la cárcel = éxito de España.

Creo que te equivocas. Me pongo como ejemplo: como ya digo creo que la jueza ha actuado correctamente. Aun asi no lo veo como un ""exito de España"" (para nada), y como ya te digo, no tengo gana ninguna de celebrar. Es posible que tengas la imagen de que la mayoria de los Españoles son del tipo ""a por ellos"", pero eso es algo que se dice en un momento de pasion y que muchisimos Españoles (yo diria que la gran mayoria) no se sienten asi realmente. Sin entrar en el ""quien tiene la culpa"" seguro que no es dificil ponerse de acuerdo que esto esta jodiendo a la sociedad entera bien jodida (tanto Catalana como no Catalana) y de una forma monstruosa. Y creo que de eso es consciente mucha gente, quiza muchos mas Españoles de lo que tu piensas.

Solo te pido que no entres en el juego de la retorica ""oficial"" de tu equipo (se puede ser indepe de naciones y a la vez de pensamiento) que lo que mas busca es que veas al ""enemigo"" como una masa monolitica y de pensamiento unico. Yo te prometo que hago el esfuerzo propio todos los dias (y muchas veces fallo). Veo el hecho de que hoy me sienta mal como un pequeño exito personal.

Why would Germans, French, Belgians, Spaniards be entitled to be the majority in their country, get to set rules, dictate social, economic and foreign policies etc while Catalans are not allowed ?

Politicians with mandates from their population doing what they are asked from the population should not be jailed in any countries, under any circumstances. 

On that note, I find Catalans to be way too submissive. 

This would NEVER EVER FLY in Quebec. I don't think for a second that our police would comply with any Canadian orders of the sort, and there is no way Quebecois would let Canadians dictate anything, let alone jail its elected officials without riots/physical altercations happening.

2754,"Fun fact: Spanish Conquistadores were responsible the vast majority of the genocide of Native Americans. There are many many sources from Spanish Conquistadores journals explaining it in great detail. By the time the English got there, the Native population was already almost wiped out due to the diseases and genocide by the Spanish. British settled and began trading with the Natives, naturally there were some conflicts but nothing major. There was huge demand from the Cherokee for British trade goods like (Iron tools, Firearms, Ammunition) and relations were mostly positive for a long time. The Cherokee wanting those tools, meant they would willingly come to British settlers frequently to trade. Which caused even more unintentional outbreaks of disease. It wasn’t until the American Revolution where the Cherokee sided with the British against Americans and outed themselves as enemies that major conflict occurred. Then they got destroyed by the more technologically advanced society as is what happens in all human conflicts.

• ""Look at all the working poor in Germany, how can they let that happen!""

Oligarchs were for the most part stripped of political power in the early years of Putin's government when most mass media were stripped from them and transferred to the state. They still get a large share of representation in politics and have of course a major influence on economy but the oligarch is by definition is a businessman who uses political influence to make politics service him, oligarchs have very little political influence in Russia compared to the amount they have in the west, proportionally speaking.

2909,"&gt; How did they have a short amount of time?. They knew of what they were going to be acused of for weeks now. Catalunya's parlament does have law services that told them what laws they were breaking and of what they could be accused, but they chose not to listen to them.

They could not have known whether they will be accused of sedition, rebellion or just misuse of public funds or some other charges. But anyway, that's not the point, the point is that there should be some reasonable amount of time between them getting the notice and them actually showing up and 24 hours is not a reasonable amount of time. And as I said, the Supreme Court recognized that as well, so this is really not just my opinion.

&gt; Also, if they are investigating some facts that are believed to be delictive, where is the foul in the reasoning that the judge does not want those facts to be repeated? If a presumed serial killer is arrested, then should he be left free until the trial because there is still not a definitive sentence?. That's not how the justice works, if the judge believes there is enough evidence, she can adopt preemtive measures.

There definitely was a risk that they might flee, so I understand the preventive prison, but she was talking about them trying to finish Catalonia's separation from Spain, which is just absurd. They have been deposed, they have btw. peacefully gave up the positions, they had no administrative power, no control over any official Catalan institutions, so there is no risk of them finishing the whole independence process for now.

&gt; It seems to me that you believe what you want to believe.

Well, we obviously have different opinions on this, so I could say the same about you. Evidently different people have different opinions.

2970,"&gt; Work to change the Spanish constitution.

This is not only a ridiculous argument (from a Constitutional Law basis), but it's also impossible because Spanish MPs won't accept it (as it usually happens with any independence process). If you look at history, you will see how the majority of times when a independence is declared the Constitution of the State doesn't accept it. Yes this doesn't mean the independence is illegal.

From a Constitutional Law point of view, changing the Spanish Constitution so Catalonia can become independence means a Constitution should be addressing the possible independence of the internal entities of a State. This doesn't make any sense, since this is not one of the subjects addressed by Constitutional Law. Independence processes are regulated by International Law, not by Constitutional Law.

Also, this basically means Catalonia's future must be decided by Spain. In other words, Catalonia's independence must be authorized by Spain. And Catalan people opinion, should be ignored. This also means right to self-determination doesn't exist, and that this right can only be authorized by a State to its internal nations.


There's a reason why no International Law expert (from outside Spain) supports the Spanish argument.

[This](https://i.imgur.com/g9XaFhV.jpg) is what international experts say about Spanish Constitution and Catalonia's right to independence.

Here you also have the opinion from International Law professor Marc Weller at University of Cambridge:

&gt; Having reviewed the recent practice and international judgments on Kosovo, we fully conclude that there is no prohibition on the unilateral declaration of independence in the Catalan case. If the central government represses or prohibits the referendum, this will only increase its legitimacy.

Another opinion, from [Richard A. Falk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_A._Falk), American professor emeritus of international law at Princeton University:

&gt; Catalonia is winning the battle of legitimacy, which is one of the elements that are studied when discussing recognition of the right to self-determination of a territory, as it has acted in a peaceful way and seeking agreement within the democratic institutions, while the Spanish state responded with repression, intimidation and trying to cause some episode of violence. International law chooses the side that has acted more legitimately and rejects the unreasonable methods of the central government.",Catalonia,/r/europe/comments/7achr0/judge_sends_eight_former_members_of_catalan/dp98ftc/,Gerardpb2,1509653869

You didn't answer his question. I too am pretty interested in the Poles who massacred Ukrainians.

&gt;Poland can't ban anything by itself, because Poland doesn't control its borders, EU can ban something.

The UK has banned the import of Polish potatoes into the UK. Obviously they didn't need the EU's permission to do so. If Poland starts refusing visas then they're welcome to, Ukraine isn't in the EU and doesn't fall under Schengen.

[In 1885, after](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbo-Bulgarian_War) centuries of mutual fight against the Ottomans and after thousands of Bulgarians fought in the Serb war of independence. The entire bulgarian army was on the Ottoman border expecting a turkish invasion - instead, the backstabby Serbs did it.

Then in 1912 when they took all of Macedonia despite signing a treaty with Bulgaria before the war to split it. 

[Then in 1913, when they signed an anti-Bulgaria alliance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek%E2%80%93Serbian_Alliance_of_1913) with Greece in order to keep the lands in Macedonia they had promised to Bulgaria. 

And only after all of this - comes your picture, where Bulgaria tries to take the same lands that Serbia promised it would receive after 1912.

The first thing you need money for is the down payment of the credit. I mean you *can* finance 100% of your house, but you are likely to have trouble finding a bank that will give you a good annual rate, if you aren't outride refused. Banks usually want you to put down 10% or in 15.000€ in our case.

The next thing you need money for are several fees and taxes you have to pay. NRW for example demands 6.5% in property sales tax. You additionally will have to pay about 4% for notary fees and court costs to get the contract set up and ownership properly changed. And it is customary for the buyer to pay the brokers fee, which is about 7% here. That's an additional 17.5%, or 26.250€ you need to be able to pay.

Last but not least you want to set up an emergency fond for when unexpected costs occur. The last thing you want to happen is to default on your financing because you lost your job, or get into trouble because your heating unit suddenly needs replacing or something like that. Let's say 5.000€ is a reasonable reserve here.

3262,"It's a very common misconception, but that's not how government budgets work.

The government alone is able to create and print money.  It decides how much money to allow in circulation at any given time.  This amount of money is fixed; neither citizens, nor companies, nor anyone other than the government can create money.

The government can choose to give this money to people.  It can give subsidies to corporations.  It can pay companies in return for providing public services (e.g. utility companies).  It can hire people and pay them wages to perform some duties.  Or it can give it out to certain sectors of the population, if it decides that those people having money would benefit society more than them not having money.

The government can also decide to take money away from people, in the form of taxes, fines, and the like.  It can do this to control inflation (which it has total control over, as it is the only entity able to create and destroy money).  It can do this to discourage (or punish) people from engaging in certain behaviors, like smoking.  It can do this in order to maintain a balance of power - to prevent a few individuals from hoarding much more of the wealth than they need, for instance.  It can also, unfortunately, take money away from people in order to exacerbate power imbalances, favoring the rich and keeping the middle and working class from accumulating too much wealth, and therefore power.

Every first-world country today has the unlimited capacity to manage this money dispersal in a way that ensures that everyone gets plenty of opportunity to advance, and that no one is left to suffer an inhumane life.  Our resources are abundant enough to ensure that everyone can have access to quality food, housing, healthcare, education, etc. - with countless left over for the more ambitious to have a quality of life above and beyond what you most likely personally experience now.

And yet, people perceive that guaranteeing unemployed people a basic standard of living ends up squeezing working and middle class people like yourself.  Why might that be, when our resources are so abundant?

It's because the government is baking thirty pies, giving 29 to their wealthy friends, and forcing you and Homeless Joe to fight over the last one (although in reality the inequality is much vaster than this).  In your mind, it may seem unfair that Homeless Joe gets any pie at all when you're busting your ass for your share.  I am consistently in awe, though, that very few people seem to be asking, ""Wait, where did the other 29 pies go?""  I suspect that if you were provided the opportunity to obtain enough pie to never go unsatisfied, you wouldn't mind if Homeless Joe got a slice once in a while too.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/7a9x18/unemployment_eurozone_89_in_september_lowest/dp8mlzd/,peppermint-kiss,1509632035

3273,"You haven't really debunked anything. Fact is, if people are free to choose without government intervention, they overwhelmingly segregate among racial lines in the US.

Examples of the US government having to force people into ""diversity"": Desegregation busing, Fair Housing Act, the Housing and Urban Development Department that was specifically designed to fight (completely natural) racial segregation and a multitude of similar government program over the past decades.

Just look around countries like the US or Canada: if people are left to their own devices, they choose to live among others who are like them most of the time. That's true for white Americans (white flight phenomenon), Asian Americans (Chinatowns etc.), black Americans (who prefer to live in black neighborhoods just like whites prefer to live in white neighborhoods) etc.

Similar things can be observed in Europe. If people are left to choose for themselves, most of the time they choose to live among people like them, which is why you have migrant ghettos in France, Germany etc., which is why Germans try to send their children to schools with low numbers of migrants, etc. etc.

Diversity and multiculturalism are inherent weaknesses that have to be forced onto people. How else would you explain that it takes government programs and propaganda for diversity and such? If it were such a positive thing and people would strife for it naturally, the government intervention wouldn't be necessary.

With that and the article literally saying ""han acabado marchándose del lugar al no disponer de orden judicial"", leads me to believe thay they didn't have legal legs to stand on and they tried just in case they got lucky, and eventually recognizing they didn't and leaving.

3396,"When I used to post on SA I used a different username so not me you are thinking of.

First off I'll take a shot at the Penal Laws which - while doubtless entirely barbaric - predate the famine by a couple of hundred years, were created with the backdrop of the Catholic/Protestant and were applied across England before Ireland so calling them a specifically anti Irish measure is stretching things. In just over a hundred years the English Crown went from burning Protestants to legislating their supremacy.

Regardless the Great Famine was many things:

* Complete negligence - the Corn Laws did serious damage to domestic growth across the whole of Great Britain. By the time they were finally repealed it was too late.

* Racism/anti-Catholicism - significant help was denied on this basis and to me it would be the closest thing to justifying the genocide claim but as it's just one part of a pretty horrific mosaic I can't agree with that. 

* British party politics - Peel's initial attempt to repeal the Corn Laws was blocked in parliament by a group who's prime concern was the effect it would have on business in England and Scotland. This and a couple of other lost fights led to the election of...

* Russell and his zealous application of laissez-faire economics by a man who wasn't just inadequate in Ireland - Russell also got Great Britain into the middle of the Crimean war doing much more of the heavy lifting than was necessary.

* Greed that can only be described as rapacious - the merchants who kept exporting food during even the worst of the famine.

I would happily call the Great Famine something similar to a genocide which is complete callousness; most of the people that made the decisions that caused it weren't making any attempt to kill off the Irish, they either just didn't give a fuck about Ireland or viewed Irish Catholic (not all Irish) lives as utterly unimportant compared to the objectives they wanted to accomplish.

In truth I'm not sure if that disregard for human life is better or worse than an intentional genocide but I would say it's different. ",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/7a5knk/mural_in_belfast_northern_ireland/dp8du0f/,MrZakalwe,1509617121

Everyone looks on Catalonia, not noticing that their websites where not the only ones shut down, but although websites of persons and organizations trying to proof the corruption claims. There where also some arrests in other parts of the country. The situation reminds of turkey, a lot of people got arrested by simply naming them enemys of the state, in Spain they are arrested as supporters for Catalonias Independence. Wether it is true or not. The big difference is that the number of arrests made in Spain outside Catalonia is far less. While in prison awaiting a judge to decide if they are guilty or not, their houses and offices are searched, documents and laptops are confiscated and examined. All you need is a handfull corrupt policemen for the next step. They will look through all evidence but not for traces of supporting Catalonias Independence but for proof about the corrupt Politicians.

3524,"&gt; The thing about exporting food from Ireland during the famine has become a standard fixture on this sub as seen by the prominence given in the title here, where it's used to imply that the British were shooting starving rioters while simultaneously taking away the food they needed for Britain's own profit. It's still worth pointing out that, despite its frequent repetition here, the claim that it was significant is very much fringe history based on the views of a non-scholar writing in the mid-1800s. It is not accepted by the mainstream of historians as a significant factor in the famine because Ireland was actually a huge net importer of food during the critical period. While certain foodstuffs that were being produced for overseas markets did continue to leave Ireland during the famine years, they were dwarfed by the massive imports of grain the British government brought in from North America. The optics of any food at all leaving the island are obviously poor but it was not a factor in the death toll.

&gt; At the height of the famine in 1847 3.7 million hundredweight of wheat was imported as part of the relief effort vs 335 thousand exported. A net 13.6 million hundredweight of corn from the US was imported and the only grain that was exported more than imported was oats, which were primarily considered to be horse-feed rather than food for humans.

http://www.efm.bris.ac.uk/ecesc/Articles/Irish%20Trade.pdf

&gt; Ireland was not a net exporter of food during the famine and the exports that did happen were dwarfed by the imports that came in to provide relief, eventually feeding a huge chunk of the population. The fact that any food was leaving makes for a fine emotive point but it was not a relevant factor in the outcome. The idea that it was comes from John Mitchell, who, in the 1860s advanced the claim that Ireland actually had enough food to feed itself through the famine and would have been fine, or at least much better off if not for the exports, which were a critical elements in causing the mass deaths. But, despite the popularity of Mitchell's thesis on reddit, the definitive survey of the views of historians of the period (The Oxford Handbook of Modern Irish History) states that ""Few historians support the case"" and that those who do are outliers who can only sustain their conclusions by assuming that there were massive exports that we, somehow, have no documentary evidence for. The documentary record is entirely clear on the amount of food entering and leaving the island, so assuming unsubstantiable and unrecorded movements of vast quantities of food is the only way it's possible to claim that the British approach to food import and export was a net contributor to famine deaths.

Ernst Ulrich von Weizsäcker is considered one of the pioneers among environmentalists - above all because he knows the subject inside out. Now the president of the expert organization Club of Rome, which focuses on sustainability, has taken a surprising position for the combustion engine - or rather: against its hasty condemnation. ""Please don't make a snap shot at the combustion engine,"" writes Ernst Ulrich von Weizsäcker, a scientist from the natural sciences, in a catalogue of demands for the Jamaica talks to form a German coalition government. 
 
""Firstly, **with today's electricity mix, the electric car is more climate-damaging than the internal combustion engine**. Secondly, the Audi model can convert excess wind power, which is otherwise destroyed, into hydrogen or methane and thus feed the climate-neutral internal combustion engine. Nevertheless, however,""of course, it is necessary to push ahead with e-vehicle technology,""explained Weizsäcker. 

It also calls on the future coalition to implement the German voluntary commitment under the Paris climate protection agreement and to **introduce a gently rising CO2 tax**. In the coalition negotiations, the Greens insist on banning the combustion engine by 2030.

Maybe you're used to Brazilian Portuguese rather than the European version, but in Portuguese standard pronunciation vowel reduction is extremelly common, and heavier than in other Romance languages

""European Portuguese has taken this process one step further, raising /a, ɐ/, /e, ɛ/, /o, ɔ/ to /ɐ/, /ɨ/, /u/ in all unstressed syllables. The vowels /ɐ/ and /ɨ/ are also more centralized than their Brazilian counterparts. The three unstressed vowels /ɐ, ɨ, u/ are reduced and often voiceless or elided in fast speech. If /ɨ/ is elided, which mostly it is in the beginning of a word and word finally, the previous consonant becomes aspirated like in 'ponte' (bridge) [ˈpõtʰ], or if it is /u/ is labializes the previous consonant like in 'grosso' (thick) [ˈgɾosʷ].""

The question of Catalonia being a part of Spain or not, considering all the ties and specifications, is ultimately affecting the interests of Spain as a whole. To that, it also domestically has the legal right to decide how the issue with Catalonia is resolved. Internationally it has the legal right to protect own territorial integrity.

Is it undemocratic? Depends, ""democratic"" is a term with a pretty wide meaning. However, let's just say that it's not democratic. Why? There are several reasons. State tend to not want to give up on their sovereignty, obviously, but more importantly there is also a pragmatic side to it. There are many regions that have cultural contrast or ""uniqueness"" in relation to the majority of the population of the state they are part of. If they have all of them had the right to unilaterally separate themselves from the states, it would most likely, to put it simply, cause a significant destabilization of the international system, significantly increasing the likelihood of conflicts. Moreover, these ties develop and change with time. Not only there would be many more new states created, but the changes, accessions, separations, might occur every other decade. By itself, it's a threat of chaos.

(me for example - I voted 2 times for PO and switched to PiS in last elections - the reason for it was politicall offer to crisis (Russia, Economy, migrants.. etc.) presented by both parties).

Most people choose PiS over PO - and it was not by some drastical change. Simply looming crisis put forward people beliefs in certain areas over those in others. (In Poland for example ""Safety"" is several positions above ""rule of law"" in peoples minds)

A better example is saying that the nazi swastika comes from the buddist swastika. Well, as a design, sure, but there is not much in common between the two.

Obviously there's a substantial amount of Germans that *welcome* these migrants and even want more of them, often to the point of wanting to completely abolish all borders and letting everyone in, even gloating about Germans becoming a minority in their own country in a couple of decades. I've even heard absurdities like ""Germans will become inbred without migrants"" first hand.

I know that because I live in one of the most left-leaning districts in Germany, which is populated mainly by these ""refugees welcome"" types. But that kind of attitude is popular all over Germany and the anti-migrant crowd is still minority, as seen in the recent federal elections.

So when these migrants in Greece demand to be transferred to Germany and most Germans obviously want that, too, why would the Greek government not comply? The train tickets and transportation costs surely must be miniscule compared to the costs of housing and feeding them.

But of course know that there's a substantial left-leaning population in Greece, too - so maybe they want to keep all the future doctors and nobel prize recipients to themselves :) (now admittedly, *that* was indeed sarcasm).

3650,"&gt;But not so the Catalans. They have an advanced autonomous rule in a country ranked by OECD in the top ten in the world where fiscal decentralization (direct collection of taxes by the sub-national units) is concerned. Not only are their general human rights not infringed upon in democratic Spain, which also ranks among the most democratic countries in the world by Freedom House or Human Watch standards, but their linguistic policy had been, on the contrary, one of exclusion, not inclusion[1].  

&gt;In Catalonia students are only taught in Catalan in their first years of schooling, English is more promoted than Spanish as a foreign language (although the majority of Catalans have long indicated that Spanish was the number one mother tongue, before this statistical item was dropped). The obligatory use of Catalan as the sole medium of instruction for all school subjects has been championed by Catalan nationalists over the past decades with little contestation, although in no other region of Europe has a group which does not have the linguistic majority managed to promote a monolingual model[2].

Finally, people start talking about this scandal. Catalan governments need to be pressured to abandon this policy. It's repulsive. It's something unprecedented in democratic or liberal regimes. 

&gt;True, the Spanish dictator Franco had once banned Catalan in schools, but arguing in democratic Spain that one has to go completely in the opposite direction to do justice or make reparation, goes too far. In fact, in a bilingual society a bilingual model should be promoted to ensure social communication. Had a similar policy existed in Scotland, they would have gained independence by now. This long term linguistic policy is a proof of an exclusionary, not inclusionary identity politics

Exactly. 

It's rather bleak how, under Franco, from 1967 onwards, [schools would offer 5 hours of Catalan per week](http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1967/09/12/pagina-20/34356141/pdf.html), yet nowadays children whose mother tongue is Spanish are often limited to 1 to 3 hours of Spanish per week.

Going by what ive seen online over the years Serbs they seem to be quite open minded and accepting, more so than one would intially expect considering its a rather poor, Eastern European and rather backwater-ish place. But despite that they seem pretty keen on being cosmopolitan, pro-LGBT and open to diversity etc(Just why is that?..). I mean perhaps this open mindedness comes from the fact that Serbia has had relatively little exposure to other outsiders/those who are different etc thus the slate is still clean as it were and one doesnt see the same level of animosity and bad relations that you see in actually more diverse countries. But still i'd never expect such a country as Serbia to be as accepting as they appear to be.

It is true, as you say, that many innocuous objects have been used by terrorists to cause harm, but your average radicalised individual doesn't know how to make bombs off the cuff. Access to this information increases the probability of their use. 

The content of the book should matter very little though. I can have ""Mein Kampf"" on my bookshelf without expecting to be put on a list for potential genocide merely because the instructions are within. Similiar to if I were a hunter I don't expect to be on a list of ""potential mass murderers"" because I own a firearm. 

&gt;Regarding him fighting in an active war zone. Yes, he can go to a war zone and fight, but there is no proof that he was fighting for who he was fighting for.

I'm sure he has ample proof in pictures, videos and not even to mention that I am confident that the british intelligence authorities were tracking him. If they didn't then, well, that's their fault. 

A citizen should never have to face arrest or have his rights taken away due to the incompetence of the state. It's not HIS job to proof he is innocent, it's THEIR job to proof that he is guilty of smth illegal. 
You can't arrest everyone in a car crash and say ""Alright, it's now your duty to proof to us that you *didn't* cause the crash."".

Maybe during the famine years themselves, but the effects of the land confiscations and the penal laws (which weren't even fully repealed) had laid a groundwork of poverty and exploitation which wasn't really resolved until the early 1900's.

3804,"&gt; All of that said, the problem underlying everything else was the over-reliance of the Irish on the potato crop, which was in turn a product of the size of the Irish population at the time. It had risen from 3.2 million in 1750 to 8.2 million a century later: an enormous total, nearly a third higher than it is today. The result was a severe shortage of land. At least a quarter of the country’s farmers scratched a living from tiny plots of five acres or less, and this in turn meant that, in order to survive, families had to turn over all their land to the cultivation of the highest-yielding, most nutritious crop. By 1845, the potato was not only the staple, but in many cases the only, food sustaining a huge number of Irish men, women and children. Thus, while the potato blight of 1845 struck many different countries, from the US to Belgium, it hit hardest in Ireland.

Given the population had risen at such a rate, it only made sense to produce the highest yielding crop.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/7a5knk/mural_in_belfast_northern_ireland/dp7z8k0/,amanko13,1509589326

We were forced onto poorly arable lad because the British literally took the good land for themselves.

I'll explain my perspective in a bit more depth because I am conscious of how you have interpreted it.

While technically legal, ownership of the book is heavily monitored by police. It's legal, but ownership will certainly put you on a list that dramatically heightens the probability of getting your door kicked in at 3am.

This is because the book purportedly gives detailed instructions on how to create improvised bombs and weapons. It is true, as you say, that many innocuous objects have been used by terrorists to cause harm, but your average radicalised individual doesn't know how to make bombs off the cuff. Access to this information increases the probability of their use. 

You could argue that vans and knives have been used by terrorists but banning them would be tough as they have mainstream uses, and as far as I know there aren't any other normal uses for the information in the book.

Regarding him fighting in an active war zone. Yes, he can go to a war zone and fight, but there is no proof that he was fighting for who he was fighting for. 

He could have gone to Syria to join ISIS and return as a sleeper, or he could have gone to Syria, been captured by ISIS, tortured to give personal details of his family and then threatened to return home and provide support to cells under threat of having his family targeted. The possibilities are endless, and actually quite plausible.

I have no doubt that his ownership of the book is innocuous, but when combined with him returning from a war zone where sleepers are known to be returning from, I think it warrants him spending time with the authorities to clear things up. 

At the end of the day, it all comes down to whether we trust the judicial system to come to the right conclusion. 

Although I recognise our system can be vastly improved, I generally do believe it its efficiency, and if we start to bypass it then we have big problems on the horizon.

Another thing to consider, the outrage over this story is because the guy is white. If an Asian guy had a copy of the book, and disappeared to go to Syria to fight, nobody would batt an eyelid about him being processed through the judicial system before acquitted and released.

Russian Tsar promised to never invade Poland again but he was killed by Russian spies, Russians prefered young Wladislaw but he had to convert to Orthodoxy and this was a problem for his father. Polish king didn't know what to do with Moscow and Russia, he didn't want his son or himself to convert into Orthodoxy and there was no possibility that Russians would accept Catholic ruler, and definitely not Sigismund III.

4000,"&gt; a) they suffered historical injustices that parallel those in the New World

So did most of the people of Europe. In the time before WW1 Germans conceptualized Eastern Europe in very similar manner to the way Western Europeans were conceptualizing Africa - as dark and messy continent filled with barbaric, inferior people that ought to be removed for the German settlers. 

Not to mention historical processes where it did happen, like the German Ostsiedlung. Germans in the 10th century went as far east as roughly the Inner German border during Cold War, but by 1914 Germans extended to Lithuania and in all major cities in Latvia and Estonia. 

Speaking of Latvia and Estonia, after the Northern Crusades of the 12th century Germans simply never left and created the ruling class in Baltic states on ethnic grounds with cities, aristocracy and politics all being completely dominated by German colonizers and local Baltic and Estonians being relegated to the roles of peasants. 

&gt;b) they arrived long before the people who oppressed them (who just so happened to be as white as them) and

That's highly disputable and even if they did Germanics also arrived in Scandinavia several thousand years before Christ. If you want to make Sami indigenous but Germanics not you'd have to arbitrarily draw a line in sand. 

&gt;c) they've retained much of their local culture

So did Lithuanians, Latvians, Estonians, Slovenes, Croats, Serbs, Ukrainians, Poles, ....

&gt;that is oldest

By any reasonable means French are as native to France as the Basques are, considering the brunt of the (native, white) French population derives from the Celts with some Frankish and Roman admixture.

4015,"&gt; nationality like Canadian or American, not an ethnicity

In the central and eastern Europe a nation is not given by adherence to a state. A nation is a group of people that identify themselves as a nation. Mostly they have a common language and a common territory. They very often have a common political history, they had often a separate state in early middle ages, part of these states belonged to the Holly Roman Empire. But for example Germans and Jews were present in large part of the territory mixed with other nations. Western Europe was also like this in past. The French kings gradually suppressed diversity and the French revolution finished it. But as you can see on the example of Catalans, Flemish or Scottish the situation is not so far form the Eastern Europe. Also some northern Italians consider themselves a separate nation. Establishing of nations in Europe is a complicated process and almost each nation had its own way. There is no general common rule defining what a nation is. Industrialization caused a specific process considered often as a national revival but it was a redefinition of national identities or even a genesis of a new nations. Are Austrians a separate nation or are they Germans only living in a separate state?  In 1930s a response to this could cost people life. 

There is no rule you could use to decide if Moldavians are Romanians or a separate nation. There is also no rule to decide if they should have a common state even if they would consider themselves the same nation. And it is very arrogant and stupid to say that Moldavian identity is caused by a Soviet brainwashing.

&gt;In summary, there is excellent evidence that the British could have done far more to alleviate the famine than they did, and that, even though the event occurred well before modern ideas of how to respond to such crises were formed, a good many people were critical of the extent of British aid at the time. There is also good evidence that a significant proportion of Protestant Irish landlords put their own economic interests ahead of those of their tenants and that a few influential policy-makers were willing to let the famine largely run its ""natural"" course for a combination of political, economic and ideological reasons. There is not, at least in my view, any evidence of an active conspiracy to materially worsen the conditions that the Irish suffered.

4069," The crucial question in whether or not it is genocide comes down to intent. Did the British government intend to destroy the Irish people? The answer is no. They were heartlessly negligent, but neglect is not the same as murder. There was never any plan to wipe out the Irish nor any actions that could be viewed as such. The government didn’t directly kill anyone nor did they deliberately destroy any food. In fact the relief aid, pathetic as it was, does damage the genocide argument. After all, why would the government set up soup kitchens if it wanted the Irish to die.

It was not murder or genocide that killed so many, but neglect. Had the government really wanted to exterminate the Irish, they would have done more than let natural disasters run their course.

Think about this, if you want to expand the definition of genocide to include government negligence, then you could also argued that [this is ""genocide""](http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/1-2-million-child-deaths-that-india-could-have-prevented/story-fqjt5vL8B3pfSxtaFobCiO.html) (they know millions of people are dying, they have the power/means to give them food and medicine.

4073,"&gt; Idk how to make explosives but creating antibiotic resistant bacteria is relatively easy if you know how to modify plasmids, transform these into the bacteria of interest and grow them on selective media. This is something I learned in my 3rd year of biomed.

I know you mean well, but AMP resistant E. Coli do not a weapon make. Even if you went down the list, jamming in all the resistant genes you had in your lab into the damn thing, it still wouldn't be dangerous. 

One, the organism has to actually meaningfully harm people, two it has to be spread through casual social contact, and three have no vaccine. And, meeting all of those qualifications, you will have to find a cultured sample that hasn't been confined to a secure facility. There's a reason why you don't have to use a decontamination shower to get into your place of work.

Then of course, assuming you managed to make this pathogen, you'll have to release it, and then evolutionary biology takes over. If the environment for the bacteria doesn't actually contain all those antibiotics, the resistance genes will actually be selected *against*, as the thousands of additional basepairs they entail will slow down the replication of your bacteria compared to wild bacteria.

This is a known phenomena that actually leads to the loss of engineered traits in genetically modified organisms.

&gt; Explosives are very different but I guess you could modify bacteria to produce explosive compounds but that requires extensive modification of complete metabolical pathways and an expertise in biochemistry, which is probably closer to doctorate level stuff.

You say its complicated but somehow manage to trivialize just how insane of a task that would be. Also, considering that pretty much any ""grown"" explosive would require your organism to fix nitrogen (which is not easy) and then not use the nitrogen for its own benefit, that's an uphill battle to stabilize.

(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohthere_of_H%C3%A5logaland)

&gt;Ohthere said that he lived **furthest north of all Norwegians**, and that his home was in ""Halgoland"", in the north of Norway, by the sea. Halgoland is identified in modern historiography as Hålogaland, a historical region of northern Norway comparable in area to the modern region of Nord-Norge. While greater precision is impossible, suggested localities for Ohthere's home include Senja, Kvaløya and Malangen, all near Tromsø. He claimed to be a leading man in his homeland, perhaps to be understood as a chieftain, and described himself as wealthy, owning 600 tame reindeer, of which six were ""decoys"" used for catching wild reindeer. Conversely, according to the report in the Old English Orosius, Ohthere ""had not more than twenty horned cattle, and twenty sheep, and twenty swine, and the little that he ploughed he ploughed with horses."" **But his main wealth was in tax paid by the Finnas, or Sami people**, of whom the highest-born paid 15 marten skins, 5 reindeer skins, 1 bear skin, 10 ambers of feathers, 1 coat of bear skin or otter skin and two ship's ropes, each 60 ells long, made of either whale skin or seal skin.

&gt;Another source of Ohthere's wealth was the hunting of whales and walrus. He is reported as saying that his own land was best for whale-hunting, with walrus up to 7 ells long and whales mostly 50 ells long, and that with five men he had killed sixty of them in two days. While the killing of this number of whales in two days seems unlikely, historian Kjell-Olav Masdalen suggests that, rather than whales, Ohthere intended the number killed to refer to walrus; Janet Bately suggests that it might best be seen as an indication of how many whales could be caught in good conditions. Ropes of whale skin were of sufficient value to be **included in the tax paid to Ohthere by the Sami**, and Ohthere said that walrus had ""very noble bones in their teeth"", some of which he brought to King Alfred.

&gt;Also, large navigable rivers running through your land is very good, because trade on and along rivers is easier than across land

Sure there are. None of them serve as the division between the Roman and Germanic world's though. The Rhine impeded the movement of armies which kept this cultural division alive. 

&gt;Those are not borders of the Frankish Empire, you are just describing areas within it...

I'm aware, with these internal geographic divisions it's no wonder no successor could ever reunite the Empire and frankly it's a miracle that the thing was ever formed in the first place.

&gt;This is how the Empire looked after the coronation of Charlemagne as Emperor.
So buffer states in the east, surrounded by sea on nearly all sides but south Italy and mountains around the provinces in modern Spain, seems like quite above average geographic 
placement for borders when historic empires are considered.

Thick forest to the East, the Rhine and large marshland in the center and the Alps to the South cutting the Empire off from Italy. 

Inevitably you're going to see individual centralization to the East and West of the Rhine and South of the Alps as the central authority is impeded from forcing its will.

&gt; Tell that to the Romans lol.

The extinct Romans who steamrolled inferior Gallic and Germanic tribes then suffered from rebellious regional governers and generals and eventually fell apart as Germanic tribes consolidated the holdings they took from the Empire. Those Romans?

We think differently.

The difference in your quality of life if you have €50 000 instead of €5000 is drastic but having €500 million over €50 million changes absolutely nothing. The first millions are hard to earn but the rest isn't, so let's not pretend that any multimillionaire has deserved the life of utter luxury more than an orphan or severely disabled or sick people, especially if you inherited the money. Those less advantaged people need help, so you're not morally entitled to huge piles of cash when thousands of others are suffering.

Except under certain circumstances. Most of these seem to be qued from negative situations or at least perceived negative situations. Depression, low physical health and long periods of anger/frustration seem to trigger an increase in wanting to have sex with your sibling. 

You can sort of see why in the wild if you in that state it is likely you were unable to find a mate inside your territory so the defences in your mind drop down and enable you to do something you wouldn't normally. Plus there is a bit of a genetic hail mary going on in which if there where few survivors then the chance of siblings that both survived having the gene to pass on is increased.

4310,"&gt; In elections, you count deputies, not votes. So if Yes has more deputies than No, the independence can go ahead.

That's the answer I feared. Actually, you can count votes in elections too. [A quick look at Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_regional_election,_2015) can give me the number of votes for JxSí (1,628,714) CUP (337,794) and every other party in the Catalan parliament. 

If independentist parties argue that a majority of seats is enough when lacking the numbers (numbers that can be checked by everyone), they'll be making the error of using representative democracy rules for a plebiscite, and they'll probably be accused of moving the goalposts. 

After all, the very point of using these elections as a plebiscite should be because there's the opportunity to vote legally and count the votes. Otherwise, a vanilla representative majority is only legitimised to do vanilla representative things (like choosing a president or passing normal laws; heck, independentist parties wouldn't even be legitimised to change their own statute of autonomy without 2/3 of the seats).",,/r/europe/comments/79vfu9/puigdemont_hires_belgian_lawyer_who_defended_eta/dp7087e/,Misticsan,1509552507

4317,"It's a political problem. Linguistically, the language they speak in Moldova and Romania is basically the same. However, during Soviet times, Moscow tried to create a separate Moldovan identity, including adopting Cyrillic alphabet for the totally-not-Romanian-language. This was actually rather successful as only a small minority in Moldova today see themselves as Romanians and even calling the language 'Romanian' is, as you can see, a heated topic.

Because Moldova rejoining Romania (basically getting annexed East Germany style) has been a topic since collapse of USSR, those that oppose it have been continuing to emphasize the separate identity of Moldova, and have also portrayed Romania as aggressive and expansionist.

As I've repeatedly stated here, I'm surprised by the lack of enthusiasm of joining Romania in Moldova. It would be probably the best chance for them to ever join EU, but even joining Romania alone would be a massive improvement over the current extremely impoverished and corrupt society that barely even functions.

Like the saying goes: If you have a race with one Usain Bolt and ten Danny DeVitos, nine DeVitos will be in the top10.

4392,"I'm actually really interested to know what statistics they're using for these British cities, because there is something 'off' about them.

Greater Manchester is listed as having ~3.3 million people here, which is not a figure I've ever seen for Manchester before. The highest figure I've seen is [2.55 million in the Manchester Metropolitan Area, according to ESPON.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_metropolitan_areas_in_the_United_Kingdom)

Given that on this graphic, Manchester seems to have been given an extra ~800,000 people, I'm wondering if for some reason they've included inner city Liverpool (which conspicuously has pretty much exactly 800,000 people) in the Mancs figures, but strangely *not* any of the other towns in the Liverpool metro that lie directly between Manchester and Liverpool, like Warrington (160,000), Wigan-Ashton (220,000) and Runcorn-Widnes (120,000).

I don't know for sure that this is what they did, but it is the only way I can think of to make the numbers in the graphic add up - otherwise, where else did they get this extra ~800k people from?

Meanwhile, Birmingham has moved in the opposite direction - listed with ~3.1 million people, when the usual 'upper figures' for the West Mids Conurbation is [3.7 million people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_metropolitan_areas_in_the_United_Kingdom) (ESPON figures).",Scouse Republic,/r/europe/comments/7a1pxc/20_cities_in_the_eu_with_the_largest_number_of/dp6tj5s/,Mendicant_,1509545238

On the face of it, the former seems more likely for a couple of reasons. Firstly, from what I've been reading, it doesn't sound like Mas was exactly the most popular guy in Catalonia at that point (having to use a helicopter from the roof to escape protests and all). That makes it seem unlikely he that enough political capital to convince so many people to change their position on a major political issue. Secondly, approximately, 10% of the electorate decided they were pro-independence between June 2012 and October 2012. That sort of movement over three months is extraordinary enough. But if we accept the version that Mas switching to be pro-independence was the major driver of that 10% movement, then that window shrinks to something like 2 weeks!

Yes you can. If you care for being ""branded"" as a ""fat-shamer"" that's your problem.

&gt;Instead society just keeps on growing fatter. 

No it doesn't. 

&gt;Also note that the definition of fat has change quite a bit in society's eyes over the decades. Just see how you immediately jumped to the 200-300kg category. Unless you work out like crazy (i.e. have a lot of muscle mass), you're almost certainly already too fat by the time you hit 100kg.

It really didn't.  Those ""1950, this was not fat then"" are just false propaganda.

4470,"&gt;Nothing is really happenning and both side are overdramatising thing

The problem for the UK (and to a smaller extent the rest of Europe) is that Brexit *is* happening by default since article 51 was activated. Regardless of weather a deal is struck or not the UK will be out of the European Union in just over a year's time unless something drastic changes. And say what you will, but if this exit happens without a deal being place, that really can be catastrophic for the UK. It's easy to imagine a temporary economic loss of multiple percent of the GDP. And it would take years to bring this damage under control, let alone mend it. For all the bluster of some in the government, it's pretty clear that the ""no deal"" potentiality is mostly just a bluff. The effects would just be too costly for both sides, but the UK in particular.

That includes the UN agreement that set the first borders, and each time this is happening, Israel has no reason to continue the peace agreement that was already broken by Arabs.

4571,"Fair enough. 

&gt;In any country, you must abide by the laws, otherwise violence WILL be used against you

No. **Violence** as a form of punishment is not used in any western democracy (apart from the death penalty in the US and some other minor exceptions). **Force**, however, can be used as a form of punishment (if we take the liberty to define involuntary imprisonment as use of force), or as a means to force compliance. 

&gt;You are obliged to provide the data to the tax office under threats of government violence.

Let's ignore the word ""violence"" here and just assume you meant sanctions instead. Then what? In what other country are tax declarations voluntary? Of course you have to declare your taxes, otherwise there would be no tax revenue. 

&gt;Then this tax office make this data public and there is absolutely no way of defending your privacy.

You are falsely equating privacy with tax records. This is not a universal truth, and both sides of the argument have valid points. For instance your credit rating is also public information. Making the tax records public is not an arbitrary measure, it is meant to, among other things, hinder tax evasion.

&gt;You may not see it, but this is what tyrannical regimes do

No, tyrannical regimes generally suppress information to it's citizens. This is the exact opposite. Transparency is not tyrannical.

&gt;I'm not saying that Finland is tyrannical, but it is usually hard to see the tyranny coming.

This is a bit rich, isn't it? Especially considering this practise has been in use since the 18th century in most of the Nordic countries. 




And then, let's jump back to the original comment: 
&gt;At the end of every government action is a threat of violence.

Ignoring the points made above concerning the difference between violence and force, and ignoring all of the government actions that are not connected to criminal or civil offenses (let's for instance name providing food and shelter for the homeless, there are no sanctions connected to this action whatsoever) this is still false. There are many offenses that are not punishable at all, then there are offenses that are punishable by fines and other economic sanctions with no element of force. 

Maybe you are beaten by the police for breaking the law in Slovakia, but that doesn't happen here.

Maybe that's just because they're 1) were never very Muslim, so secular nationalism had appeal just like it did to Christian Balkan peoples 2) not Turkish, so compensating.

Seriously weird when they start howling with the wolves and naming their kids Cengiz...

&gt; Abulhamid probably grew up with stories of the genocide of Circassians.

Somehow I doubt that, and really doubt it was a factor.  It's well documented that his psychology was paranoia because of assassination attempts on previous sultans, and the loss of Balkan territories.

For the society you can look at such historical geopolitical factors but for specific criminal individuals I think it's more fruitful to see it as a mental illness and usually it has nothing to do with ethnicities per se, that's just how it manifested itself.

How do you explain this?  Abdulhamid massacred Armenians, even back in the 19th century.  When the Young Turk movement deposed him the first time, some Armenians (mostly in Cilicia and in cities Constantinople) supported the YT movement.  When he took back control in the counter-coup, he massacred Armenians, but YT was really irrelevant that far East.  When the CUP faction of the YT took control, it genocided Armenians.

So now matter who is in power, they massacre Armenians.  So it seems like massacring Armenians is a way for neo-Turkish leaders to divert the masses' attention and solve power struggles which are inherent given that their states are very artificial creations that glue diverse groups of Muslims together.

(Also true in Azerbaijan in the 90s.  I say neo-Turkish because this hasn't been a problem in eg Uzbekistan where they don't have a complex.)",,/r/europe/comments/79mwj5/map_of_the_armenian_genocide_and_the_deportation/dp6gqvt/,ThrowawayWarNotDolma,1509516303

When yeoman returned home, he found that his son had been killed in a fight: son had sold the smelts without telling his father.

Lieroinen was accused of murder and witchcraft. He admitted the witchcraft but denied the murder. He could not find any jurors to clear his name and take the oath but the folks were happy to witness that Lieroinen was a great witch that had found lot of stolen goods and *marked*  many thieves. However, the witnesses told that before marking Lieroinen had always insisted that the deed is on his customers' soul, not on his own soul.

Both Lieroinen and the yeoman were convicted.

4877,"&gt;What's the point of abolishing timezone changes then, if it's not to make it better for the people?

For me it's a question of logic and logistics; it is more logical and more logistically manageable *not* to have random time changes whenever *some* seasons come along.

&gt;And how is it more fucked anyway? Spain might decide to be on UTC, Sweden might go for UTC+1, and Cyprus for UTC+2, and neither of them will ever have to change twice a year.

We already have timezone changes from East to West as the rest of the planet; this is something we can't and shouldn't even try to change because that is how it works and if you need an example why *one* timezone cannot exist for such an area just look at China's mess regarding time management.

We must accept already an important rift; but your system would mean that you would create a **new** division between South and North because some countries would be one hour ahead/behind than others *not* on a East-West way (that we can't help because that's the way the world *spins* in space) but because we can't be fucked to just agree on this **one** minor thing.

Imagine that Italy and Germany, which right now operate under the same time, are now in two different timezones; alread that's going to fuck up quite a lot of logistics and will require an absurd amount of work for little to no good.

We have enough troubles as is, we shouldn't be creating even more.

4904,"Any Serb living in Kosovo when the Albanians had autonomy and self-governance will tell you how it was used to bully the Serb population. After decades of stability, a major drop in the proportional Serb population in Kosovo [can be seen to occur starting around the time of reforms in the late 60s,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_history_of_Kosovo#Early_20th_century) going from 23.55% to 13.2% in 20 years. Even with proportional majority control of the governmental apparatus and *de facto* equal representation in Yugoslav democratic bodies (including federal veto power), Kosovars continually insisted on complete independence from SR Serbia and parity with the other Yugoslav Socialist Republics. Serbs were a minority in Kosovo and their rights were not protected by the local Albanian authorities, you could not count on law enforcement if you were attacked, there was constant simmering ethnic hatred towards us (and to be fair we responded with indignation and similar anger), and that was well before the ascent of Milosevic. Why exactly do you think that happened?

And your latter statement is a total joke and ignorant of the facts. Minorities in Vojvodina have always been treated well and their democratic rights protected. Non-Albanian Muslims in Serbia proper went through the unrests of the 90s and 00s unmolested. The autonomy of specific minorities in specific autonomous provinces was limited for specific reasons, which CNN would of course never tell you about, because when you mention CIA-backed terrorist groups and decades of oppression you begin to lose the black-and-white moral high ground Western governments needed to present to their voters.",Serbia,/r/europe/comments/79x0qh/suriname_revokes_recognition_of_kosovo/dp6e27l/,TwoSquareClocks,1509510632

The second during the alliance against Bulgaria. As a whole, the relationship between us seems good because we have distance between us.

4906,"Well I would rather have neither Russian or American bases. Hence why no NATO and why conscription. Hence why EU membership and supporting EU common defense.

I agree some of Europe needs to up their defense, but not for sake of NATO. Rather for themselves and for common defense of Europe. Which does not require NATO or capability to crush and conguer Russia. All it takes is sufficient level of resourcing to counter an attack and make the price of attack too high for **any** attacker against Europe. Which basically means EU, since EU also has common defense article and is way more integrated and deep rooted than NATO. 

Not militarily, but politically and societally, which is what these defence pacts come down to in the end. All defense pacts are just words on paper. What comes down to is 'do we have interest and willingness' when rubber meets the road. 

EU is so intertwined, that even though the wording in treaty is more vague than say NATO article 5, the pact is more substantial. Since due to common market etc. attack on one of us is **literally** attack on all of us, since events in one EU country will necessarily always affect all others due to the integrated status of the Union. Ignoring attack is not matter of treaty breach, it is a matter of daily practical effect.

It means Schengen border is breached, due to free movement your own citizens are probably in that countru, your countrus businesses have businesses in attacked country, said attacked country will raise hell in EU Parliament about getting aid and will stop all unanimous decisions in EU council until aid is sent.

&gt;

&gt; The Public Prosecutor's Office identifies three phases in the secessionist process, beginning with a ""preparatory phase"" between 2015 and 2017. The facts investigated reveal that ""an international image campaign was carried out"" to convey to the world ""a unique and biased account of the situation in Catalonia "".
&gt;
&gt; This lobby came to recruit for the pro-independence cause ""more or less well-known characters from the international scene"" who mobilized - via social networks, fundamentally - in favor of the independence cause.

-  ""First off, active resisters before D-Day constituted not a small minority of the French population but a tiny one—perhaps as low as two percent of the people were actively engaged in publishing underground newspapers, sabotage operations, intelligence gathering, recruiting, or participating in one of the networks designed to rescue Allied fliers.""

The French resistance is a myth of 'everyone fighting off the Nazis'. I'm gonna give you some numbers: there were around 50 thousand active fighters during the Lithuanian partisan movement, and about 100 thousand supporters (https://lt.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lietuvos_partizanai). Let's do the math: 50.000 out of 2,5 million is 2%. The French resistance was a regular resistance, nothing special about it.

But the funny thing is you give a link about Carles and it says

&gt;Unas vivencias que explican en gran medida porqué, **siendo un convencido independentista, el joven Carles optó por el partido del pactista Pujol** y no por formaciones más rupturistas como Esquerra Republicana. «Los pueblos tienen derecho a la libertad, al igual que los hijos a irse de casa. Pero el proceso es difícil porque no hay mentalidad democrática en España, que aún está anclada en el imperialismo de los siglos XV y XVI.

As I've said in another post - I'm glad to give money to the public school system. Do I have to justify such expense? I would assume - correct me if I'm wrong - that you too are happy about your tax euroes being used in such manner. 

This we use to establish that giving power to the government by itself is not bad (again, if you're an anarchist, that's another matter). 

Why this one specifically though? Because as I said in another post - as I'm glad to pay taxes so I'm not surrounded by illiterates (or sickly people), I'm glad to pay taxes so I'm not surrounded by inbreds.

5165,"&gt;Yeah, it solved the Serbian issue, by destroying their separatist political entity.

Good, you admit it one way or another.

&gt;They rose up because propaganda told them to.
Croats were absolutely in no position to do them harm in the early 90s, Croatia had neither military nor political capability, not even a fully functioning police force.
Had they not rose up, nothing would have happened.

There is no denying Belgrade propaganda played a big part. But your leadership did very little to combat this propaganda, in fact it only gave it more munition. Don´t deny this. Serbs were turned from a constituent people into a minority, which they last were (with the exception of WWII) in Austria-Hungary. Ustaše in emigration were allowed to return, and Tuđman and co. did not give of the feeling that they had good intentions. Which they did not have, they were no better than Slobo (or latter Alija).

Had they not risen up they´d be stuck living in a country they still feared with minority rights, separate from Serbia, something they ancestors fought to make sure wouldn´t be the case. 

&gt;But Croatia absolutely was the victim in the last war, just as it was the villain in the war before that one, the roles switched.

I don´t consider either side the victim in the last war. I do believe that you had the right to secede, but only if the Serbs in Croatia were also allowed to secede, that is stay with Yugoslavia. Otherwise it´s double standards. 


The number stayed consistent due to the fact that post war many were moved into the now deserted of those killed, also, NDH did include Bosnia, so many of the victims were from here, not the latter republic of Croatia.

Had they remained in the homes they would have certainly been subject to attacks, bullying, discrimination and quite possible ethnic cleansing anyways.

As for Z-4, it´s not as clear cut as you make it out to be. I do agree that rejecting it was a massive mistake, but don´t act like you guys wanted peace. It was clear that both Tuđman and Milošević despised the plan, just that Franjo reluctantly accepted it cause he knew Slobo wouldn´t. The Croatian public too wasn´t too happy with the plan. After this you carried out Op. Flash, attacking Krajina, despite the area being guarded by the UN. And when they asked you pull back you refused. You wanted the plan to fall through just as the Austrians wanted the ultimatum to fall through in 1914. Doesn´t excuse our actions, but please don´t act like you wanted a diplomatic solution.

&gt;That is arguable, but the court decision is not.

Of course I can´t argue with the court but I can refuse to accept their decision. I doubt many of you people are too happy about Vojo getting released.

&gt;Dude, nobody outside Croatia and Serbia care now, even less will care in years time.

Again, read what I said before. One day, when the world order shifts away from the US and NATO, presumably to China and maybe Russia, that decision will be painted as something shameful the west made possible. ",Rep.

Thats exactly how these things work...

There are conflicting articles i have found, which means its not as clear cut as you claim. None of them official sources. All of them says *de facto* withdraw of recognition is possible. One source says de *jure* withdraw of recognition is hard (possible) while an American law website says its not possible. I mentioned American becuase, well, for USA its not since they are part of that agreement.

&gt;A state **may withdraw diplomatic recognition of another state**, or simply refuse to deal with that other country, after withdrawing from all diplomatic relations with that country, such as embassies and consulates, and requiring the other country to do the same. The state will appoint a protecting power to represent its interests in the other state. -**Wikipedia** (no sources stated)

---
&gt;Sometimes it is possible to withdrawn a granted recognition. Especially, it is easier for the de facto recognition since the position is different with the de facto recognition which includes an ambiguity for the future of the entity. If the government of the entity loses the effective control on its territory there will be no ground for recognition and it may be taken back. On the other hand de jure recognition is **more difficult to withdraw** because as mentioned above it is stronger than de facto recognition. - **LawAspect.com**

---
&gt;De Facto Recognition

&gt;This is a provision recognition and not a permanent one. i.e it **can be withdrawn by other States at any time.** 

&gt;De Jure Recognition

&gt;This is a permanent recognition which one granted **cannot be taken back or withdrawn by other States**.  - **lawnotes.in**

So unless you can find a text from UN or any organization Suriname is part of that makes it illegal to withdraw *de facto* recognition (or de jure for that matter), this is simply pointless talk. In fact even then it would be pointless other than putting an argument, as they just did it regardless if its legal or not.",,/r/europe/comments/79x0qh/suriname_revokes_recognition_of_kosovo/dp5wa7c/,4DEATH,1509487578

5287,"&gt;To be fair, I'm not sure how reliable are the poverty statistics. They claim that 45% of the population in my community (Canary Islands) live in poverty.  

 45% sure sounds very far from the reality. Almost half of Canarias living in poverty? that's just not true.  

&gt;And while we are indeed a poor community, I don't think we are that bad. I mean, 45% poverty probably implies hunger and people dying in the streets or something?  

 Poverty in a developed country doesn't mean dying of hunger, that simply doesn't happen in a 1st World country, there's always somewhere to go and get some help, plus here healthcare is there for everyone. But it means going to the 'food bank', getting your clothes from the local NGO, not being able to afford decent studies for your kids, not being able to pay the bills, ending up expropiated of your home, etc.

And yes, you are right, once you recognise a country, there is no back. This is a reason why Taiwan (rep. of China) is a country, because the republic of China was recognised by nearly every other country in the word at one point, although most other countries don't have formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan at the moment. On the other hand, let's take Abkhazia as an exemple, is a subject of international law with limited recognition (basically a country with no recognition) and therefore saying that Abkhazia is not a country is legitimate while saying that Taiwan isn't one is wrong.

And we also don't have to forget that a country is not the same as the government of said country (legally speaking).

5351,"&gt; My country's identity is non-debatable.

Your identity is on the same level like those that our Bosnians and Krajisnici have. So I agree that your thesis about being non-Serbs isn't debatable, since it's totally incorrect.

&gt; We, unlike our northeastern neighbors, fought for our independence, and never submitted to a foreign invader (again, unlike our northeastern neighbors).

Of course you did submit. You payed taxes to Ottomans like everyone here had, but you had more freedom ever since gaining autonomy status. The fact is that you were never fully conquered because you have hard terrain for doing so. Same like Turks actually never touched mountainous parts of north Albania.

And of course everyone fought hardly for his independence from the Ottoman's booth, from the start to the very end. So you're not special there at all.

But remind me again, why are we even talking about this when it doesn't have to do anything with someone's identity? What are you even trying to prove with it?

&gt; If you're such a big Serb, go prove it and take Kosovo or Krajina back. You won't, because just like every other nationalist idiot, you're probably a narrow-minded bigot that masturbates to pictures of Draža and maps of muh Great Serbia.

Thats a massively generalizing statement and not in a good way. Most of the people who have come to Europe as refugees over the last few years are either war refugees or economic immigrants under the disguise of pretending to be refugees. Both are looking for a better life and are certainly not here to blow people up. Otherwise we would be having daily terrorist incidents by now all over Europe. 

That said of course ISIS and other terrorist groups used the very same routes as the refugees to smuggle their operatives into Europe and are also actively trying to recruit people among the actual refugees. But they are doing the same (quite successfully) among normal European citizens. 

The idea that we would not have terrorist attacks if only we deported all refugees is ridiculous. Sure we would probably be somewhat safer but if safetly is what we value most there is a lot of other things we could do that would have greater impact on our ability to thwart terrorist plots.

However that's beside the point, I wrote he supported independence for more than 30 years and he clearly did. While you **rambled like a madman** that support was only recent. 

&gt;Puidgemont wasn't actually pro-independence till very recently

So you will keep lying ? He supported his father and others in 1992. They were clearly seperatists, one of your apparent buddies in this thread went so far as to call him a terrorist sympathiser.

5385,"Breaking with the stance of other Western countries, Israel decided on Monday not to express an official opinion on the issue of Catalan independence in the meantime, NRG reported.

According to the report, Spain asked Israel over the weekend to publicly declare that it does not support Catalan independence, as part of Spain’s efforts to garner international consensus on the matter.

Israel’s ambivalence is a departure from the opposition to Catalan independence declared by the EU and US. On Friday, US State Dept. spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement that “Catalonia is an integral part of Spain, and the United States supports the Spanish government’s constitutional measures to keep Spain strong and united.”

According to NRG, the reasons for Israel’s move are twofold: First, Catalonia is seen as a pro-Israel region, with Israeli flags a common sight on Catalan homes - notwithstanding the Barcelona municipality’s recent adoption of BDS measures.

Second, Israel is fed up with Spain’s anti-Israel stance of many years. This attitude was manifested in comments made by Deputy Defense Minister Eli Ben-Dahan during the Spanish crackdown on the Catalan referendum: “For many years, Spain lectured us about how we need to give [national] rights to the Palestinian Arabs,” wrote Ben-Dahan on Twitter. “Today we see their hypocrisy, as [Spain] doesn’t even allow the Catalans to hold a referendum on independence.”

On the other hand, officials quoted by NRG noted that Israel has also not expressly sided with Catalonia, likely so as not to pay a price for departing too drastically from international consensus.",Switzerland,/r/europe/comments/79xl0a/israel_refuses_to_support_spain_against_catalan/dp5ie0e/,JimJones4Ever,1509473121

5408,"&gt; How did they choose who to ask?

I am telling you. They should (since it is a political poll) set a quota of how many people from each affiliation to ask, to have a political representation of Catalonia so in normal circumstances, if you already have enough people from one party, you ignore the answers after you have fill the quota and call another person. You never answered a phone poll and after a couple of question being told that you are ""not the target demographic""? One of the reasons for that is because they already filled their quota for ""your type"".

However, as they explain, they have decided to vary the quotas and instead of using the political affiliation as the main source, they are driving it through age... Which is basically an excuse to publish results that are slighlty skewed, but not skewed enough to be unbelievable.

&gt; What you are saying would be true if vote memory was 100% real, but some people may hide/lie about who they voted.

Of course, so they can lie about all the other questions if they want... but ""memory"" should not be party-related so you should try to match what people remember having voted anyway.",Spaniard in UK,/r/europe/comments/79vp5g/new_ceo_poll_on_catalan_independence_487_yes_436/dp5ik5m/,Drogzar,1509473303

&gt;""At dawn I was awakened by the noise of shots and volleys. The Armenians had attacked the town. Immediately I mounted my horse and, followed by some armed men, went to see what was happening. Judge of my amazement to discover that the aggressors had not been the Armenians, after all, but the civil authorities themselves! Supported by the Kurds and the rabble of the vicinity, they were attacking and sacking the Armenian quarter, I succeeded at last, without serious accident, in approaching the Beledie reis of the town, who was directing the orgy; whereupon I ordered him to stop the massacre. He astounded me by replying that he was doing nothing more than carry out an unequivocal order emanating from the Governor-General of the province to exterminate all Armenian males of twelve years of age and over."" - Rafael de Nogales Méndez

Is that what you call an uprising?

&gt;When the Russians invaded Anatolia that’s when the real massacres

No, the real massacres started with the Ottomans. The Russian scorched earth wherever they could because their ultimate goal was to completely depopulate Western Armenia and build a Cossack state after the war. They did not even try to prevent massacres of Armenians or even punish those caught that took part in massacring Armenians. Kurdish chiefs were treated as guests of honor by Russian generals. So Russians just had no regard for anyone's life, but no massacres directly aimed at Turks as they would like to believe.

&gt;But they noticed the same pattern and basically said you can’t kill us if we kill you first

Well, to sum up, everything you said is false. Like plain wrong.

There is no nazi parties with political weight in Western Europe. America isn't immune to this sort of speech and should I remind you that when germans elected Nazis, USA had segregation ? The context is also very different, the benefits of having two ""big tent"" parties, thanks to the FPTP system, means that far-right and far-left ideologies should pass in dems or reps primaries to have actual political weight.

Nazis marchs are very rare in Europe and when it is, no political figure claim that there is good people on both sides. 

Nazis are allowed to march and to produce speech in the US but they were too in Germany before they rised to power(except for a little time but it was mostly because of the violence with death in the streets) so it seems that we weren't immune even with the freedom of speech. But sure, I guess we can let them advocating for murdering people based on their color skin or religion, nothing bad will happen and if it does it's just because of a mentally ill individual.

Western countries are all fertile ground for totalitarians (even I would reject the term because far-right nowadays are not defined by their totalitarism rather by their racism which can be find in libertarians too) but USA have a bigger issue with white supremacists and racists in general than any other countries in Europe.

It got so bad, that they moved another coffee shop directly behind the DE/NL border in Venlo, which only slightly helped to mitigate the problem. Then sometime in 2012 or so they banned foreign customers from coffee shops altogether for a year or so, which only led to drug runners roaming the area around the shops looking for German license plates to intercept people that didn't know about the new laws. Those runners of course weren't only in the business of selling weed or hash.

On the German side those people, that didn't want to drive further inland into NL to shops, that still sold to German customers, or deal with drug runners, turned towards domestic dealers indirectly financing god knows what with their purchases.

Genetic analysis of the viral genomes provides highly convincing evidence of the mutation that ""jumped species"" after human consumption. In the case of the HIV-1 M strain, the science is so accurate that it can pinpoint the exact town where the last common ancestor with SIV lived (viz. Kinshasa, Congo, in 1910). 

&gt;One would think that Africans have been eating bushmeat for generation, why would the HIV/AIDS virus have waited for the twentieth century?

Prior to the twentieth century, viral vectors in Africa were very undeveloped (as was the rest of the continent). After colonization, several factors empowered the creation and spread of new viruses:

* Creation of large towns and cities. In a low density rural setting, a new virus might wipe out its host and his tribe and then go extinct before ever making contact the world at large. But with a city, the virus can find a permanent habitat.

* Guns. Hunting a chimpanzee with a knife or a bow is actually extremely hard, because they are intelligent and agile creatures. Hunting bats is nearly impossible. But hunting these creatures with a gun is stupidly easy. After Europeans introduced guns to Africans, bushmeat became much more common.

* Sex. African tribal societies were fairly monogamous (well, it was usually 1 man to many women, but you get the idea). Non-marital sex only became common after colonization and urbanization. Many viruses are sexually transmitted.

* Injections. After the creation of many vaccines and antibiotics in the 1950s, westerners started shipping millions of syringes to Africa. Of course, the syringes were reused, and therefore provided a new vector. Some studies link smallpox eradication efforts with the inception of HIV.

* Population growth. Africa's population was minuscule in 1900, with just a few tens of millions of people. It has doubled half a dozen times since then.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV

&gt;There is evidence that humans who participate in bushmeat activities, either as hunters or as bushmeat vendors, commonly acquire SIV.[136] However, SIV is a weak virus, and it is typically suppressed by the human immune system within weeks of infection. It is thought that several transmissions of the virus from individual to individual in quick succession are necessary to allow it enough time to mutate into HIV.[137]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simian_immunodeficiency_virus

&gt;Simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs) are retroviruses that cause persistent infections in at least 45 species of African non-human primates.[1][2] Based on analysis of strains found in four species of monkeys from Bioko Island, which was isolated from the mainland by rising sea levels about 11,000 years ago, it has been concluded that SIV has been present in monkeys and apes for at least 32,000 years, and probably much longer.[3][4]",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/79ujmd/denmark_could_become_first_hivfree_country_in_the/dp5bufb/,vokegaf,1509466366

In this Clement was aided by the researches of his personal physician Guy de Chauliac who argued from his own treatment of the infected that the Jews were not to blame.

5640,"- Responsible for many war crimes during the Croatian war of independence, Bosnian war and Kosovo war.

- Has changed its name a lot during the last 100 years: Kingdom of Serbia, (part of) Kingdom of Croats, Slovenes and Serbs, (part of) Kingdom of Yugoslavia, (part of) SFR Yugoslavia, (part of) FR Yugoslavia, Serbia and Montenegro and now the republic of Serbia.

- As we all know, Serbia does not recognise Kosovo as an independent state, yet the Serbian government has recognised the government of the republic of Kosovo as the legitimate government of the autonomous province of Kosovo and Metohija.

- The non recognition of Kosovo has lead to many unique regulations: For ordinary citizens (non diplomats) the Serbian government issues five different passports.

- Serbian border guards are required to look through every single page of a passport to make sure that there is no stamp issued by the republic of Kosovo. If they find one, they will invalidate the stamp with an ""invalid"" stamp to show that the Kosovo is, in their eyes, not a country.

- Serbian Athlete Ivana Spanovic nearly won a gold medal in the women's long jump at the 2017 World Championship in London but her last and best attempt was measured around 5 cm shorter because the sticker on back touched the sand.

- The former FR Yugoslavia was the only country in history that, as part of the sanctions for the war in Bosnia and Croatia, was excluded from the Internet until 1995.

- The most expensive cheese in the world is produced in Serbia.

- Although homosexuality is not as accepted as in western Europe, Serbia has a gay prime minister.

- Serbia's BFF is probably Montenegro. There is a saying that Serbia and Montenegro are ""Two eyes in one head"".

- Serbia has also good relations with Russia although it isn't perfect: Putin has claimed that he would accept Kosovo's independence if the west accepts that Crimea is a part of Russia.

- Asteroid 1564 is called ""Srbija""

- There is a not so small seperatist movement in the northern part of Serbia.

- The list of the worst diplomatic relations between two countries was once charactarised as:

1. Russia-Ukraine

2. Serbia-Kosovo

3. Serbia-Albania

4. Serbia-Croatia

Nontheless, the situation is getting better: Croatia's president Grabar-Kitarovic and back then Serbian prime minister Vucic have agreed that both countries should cooparate on a formal basis to solve disputes and problems between the two countries. Vucic has also met the president of Albania two times but the Albanian president mentioned the Kosovo-issue which was heavily critisized by Vucic since it was not on the formal protocol. There were also informal talks between Serbia and Kosovo and both subjects of international law (that's how they actually called the it in the agreement) signed an agreement about the bare minimum of cooperation between Kosovo and Serbia.

And by the way: The best relations in Europe are between Norway and San Marino.

- There are also tensions between Serbia and Bulgaria/Romania. One of the reasons is that the two EU countries complain about lack of protection of their minorities in Serbia.

- When red star is playing against partizan you can be sure that there will be hooligans who do everything to get a good brawl.

- Another problem for Serbia joining the EU is the issue with the ""Republika Srpska"" - the other half of Bosnia that is inhabited by ethnical Serbs. The EU does not want the Republika Srpska to join Serbia but there are many people who want to achieve that or who are in favour of it.

- Some of you might remember the football game Serbia-Albania that was interrupted by a drone with a flag of greater Albania. I would say that this game will be remembered for decades but all for the wrong reasons.

- The vaterpolo games between Serbia and Croatia/Italy are great to watch because these are the three best teams in the world. The semifinal between Serbia and Croatia at the world championship this year was one of the best games I have ever seen in my life.

- The last presidential election in Serbia caused for many protests around the country against president Vucic.",,/r/europe/comments/79qfcu/what_do_you_know_about_serbia/dp5530y/,asdlpg,1509459005

5816,"&gt;Section 907 wasn't the issue I raised but the other two points that I quoted in my comment above. Furthermore Section 907 has been waived.

Section 907 remained all the way until the modern Bush era, the president before Obama. He was the president to lift the sanctions from Azerbaijan, and those sanctions were installed by measures of lobbying. It just goes to show the effectiveness and the strength of Armenian lobby, who at the time, denied all aid to Azerbaijan when every other post-Soviet state began receiving aid (including Armenia). There was another sanction as well, which prohibited weapon sales to Azerbaijan. That sanction still remains in part because of the Armenian lobby, which is why Azerbaijan relies on Israeli weaponry, and **Russian** weaponry - where Russia sells Azerbaijan poor and outdated weaponry at high market prices, and subsidizes those sales and gives Armenia high tech weaponry at almost no cost. 

Then Armenians begin meming ""Ermeni lobby, they think we have an Ermeni lobby!"" Of course, the Armenian diaspora is one of the backbones of Armenia and Karabakh. I just watched a documentary called, ""Karabakh,"" where the Karabakhi Armenians (Artsakhi Armenians for you) claimed the only reason they are surviving is because of the Armenian diaspora - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tK3qACn_Uo

&gt;As for the Circassian case, again it is not something which involves Armenia, Armenians or Armenian history, just like the Balkans, but I have said numerous times that it would be great for Armenia to recognise it. Even if because of the sponsor of the German Bundestag Armenian Genocide resolution, Cem Ozdemir who is of Circassian decent.

It doesn't involve Europe, yet Europe is the front runner in recognition when it comes to tragedies of these sorts. Why is Europe obligated to recognize the Armenian genocide when it has nothing to do with them and is not apart of their history? Why did they go ahead and recognize it? 

Why is Azerbaijan obligated to recognize the genocide when Azerbaijan had nothing to do with the genocide and it was not apart of their history? The United States? Israel? 

For a people who are staunchly adamant about having their tragedy recognized, you send a wrong message to other people in regards to their 'struggles' or issues. It also does lead to the question as to why some genocides are more important to others. 

&gt;It is also false that ""Jews"" don't recognise the Armenian genocide. Some of the most important advocates and voices since day 1 have been Jews as well as Turks. I am not sure painting a whole group of people with one single brush based off of comments read online makes much sense, whether they be Armenians, Jews, Turks, Iranians, etc...

I am going by what someone had said, there was a post on your subreddit, where one of your users claimed that Jews want to have a monopoly over genocides, that's obviously someones sentiment. I could also imagine Armenians would feel threatened, that their genocide would be somewhat diminished in contrast had other genocides gained light and recognition.

The children show up in scary costumes and we take a walk on the churchyard in the darkness.

5854,"Did you just literally nitpick little pieces of my comment to try to make your point? Or did you not read all of it?

Let's begin shall we:

&gt;Why is it breaking French law?

Read the article we're currently discussing, it's explained.

&gt;So when Polish people and their great countrymen are insulted, should Polish government be quiet? What if someone tried to remove DeGaulle's monument from Warsaw?

Read the article, they're not removing the monument just a part of it. The statue of the Pope will still stand at the exact same place, I already said this in the comment you're replying to now, this look familiar to you:

""And if the French were removing the statue of the pope, I might understand.""

Why are Polish people insulted btw? I'm French and I wouldn't give two shits if Poland decided to tear down De Gaulle's statue, it's their decision to make. If they choose not to honour his memory I could say it reflects badly on them? But it says **nothing** about the people who still do respect his memory.. so why get upset?

&gt;The exploitation started way back in 2004 and all Polish governments bent over backwards to make it possible.

Cool, so you agree with me. Or would you say it's a good thing that Poles are being exploited?

&gt;Stop being an idiot. You know well that this is a populistic liberal law to decrease the main advantage of Polish workers - low labor costs.

Are you capable of explaining this without calling me an idiot? telling me what I know and don't know.

Partially, but that’s not the main focus by any stretch. I am from East Germany.  Cultural understanding in the former Russian-controlled bloc and cultural cooperation as such (between European cultures) is entirely different in Western Europe compared to the east.

And, yes, if we can’t even find a common platform on the question of whether or not we want very close culture cooperation (as seen in the founding nations in the EU), then I’d rather have Poland not in a further integrated union.

This is not about progressivism. It’s even one step further back - it’s about the unwillingness to even argue about common values.

Certainly. Not that that means anything. Germany is a core member of the EU and I moved not even 300km within Germany.
