&gt;**What do we already know about the unlikely kidnapping in Genk, where a 13-year-old boy was held hostage for 42 days?**   
&gt;  
&gt;It sounds like a story from a crime thriller, but it was a harsh reality: a 13-year-old boy from Genk was held hostage for no less than 42 days, and was only released last night. What do we already know about this hostage-taking, one of the longest in Belgian history?  
&gt;  
&gt;""We've slept very little, it's been very exciting hours"", it sounds at the public prosecutor's office in Limburg. That seems to be an understatement, because the Limburg hostage-taking story, which had a (good) ending today, was preceded by a lot of investigation and negotiation.  
&gt;  
&gt;***What exactly happened?***  
&gt;  
&gt;On the night of 20 to 21 April, a 13-year-old boy was abducted in the vicinity of Genk. The perpetrators proceeded in a very triple manner. ""It was a violent abduction"", it sounds at the public prosecutor's office in Limburg. They arrived in a stolen car, and entered masked and heavily armed into the house where the family lives. The boy is taken away, and according to our information some other family members were threatened.  
&gt;  
&gt;*It was a violent abduction*  
&gt;  
&gt;— Limburg public prosecutor's office  
&gt;  
&gt;The perpetrators flee and disappear without a trace.  
&gt;  
&gt;***Why was the boy taken hostage?***  
&gt;  
&gt;Exactly why the boy was taken hostage isn't clear yet. His identity and background are not communicated either. One of the avenues the investigators are investigating is the drug environment, his father was once convicted of drug offences, but it is far from certain whether the hostage-taking is actually related to that. When asked whether this family was targeted, the public prosecutor's office remains vague: ""Most hostage-takings are directed at a particular person.""  
&gt;  
&gt;The fact is, the perpetrators were asking for ransom. A lot of ransom, it would amount to several millions (according to our information about 5 million euros). The public prosecutor's office does not want to communicate whether something has been paid.  
&gt;  
&gt;***Why did it take so long?***  
&gt;  
&gt;With all their might the police tried to find the boy. There would have been dozens of phone taps, but without success. The police had to be sure that the boy was safe before they could intervene. ""There were frequent contacts between the kidnappers and the family. Twice there was a sign of life,"" says the public prosecutor. ""Throughout this period, the child's interests and life were paramount. That was the guiding principle of the investigation."" For the same reason, the kidnapping and the investigation were (deliberately) kept out of the media. ""This has been particularly important to the success of the investigation.""  
&gt;  
&gt;*There were frequent contacts between the kidnappers and the family. Twice there was a sign of life*  
&gt;  
&gt;— Limburg public prosecutor's office  
&gt;  
&gt;And that was today: a little after midnight the boy was released, immediately the sign for a big police action. ""There were 12 searches, 4 in Antwerp, the rest in the region around Genk - Zutendaal, Houthalen, Maaseik."" The searches lasted until 6 a.m. this morning and a total of 7 suspects were arrested. The investigating judge will decide later whether they will be jailed as well.  
&gt;  
&gt;A total of about 100 people cooperated in the investigation, which also had an international side, because there were contacts with Dutch, French and American authorities.  
&gt;  
&gt;***How is the boy doing now?***  
&gt;  
&gt;The public prosecutor does not want to go too deep into the question of how the boy is doing now. ""On a medical level, at first sight it looks pretty okay. A forensic doctor will examine him. But, the impact on the child, being stuck for 42 days, no one wants to go through that.""  
&gt;  
&gt;*This is undoubtedly exceptional*  
&gt;  
&gt;— Limburg public prosecutor's office  
&gt;  
&gt;Anyways, this hostage-taking - one of the longest in Belgian history - is ""undoubtedly exceptional"".

Or that I'll look at a movie, see a British man on screen and feel ""represented"".

I didn't even internally class myself as 'white' until the last 4 years. I've always seen myself as Irish. It's my cultural upbringing, the group of people that I immerse myself in, the history that I learn and feel proud of, the group of people and country that I associate myself with.

But now I feel like that's all being eroded, even in European discourse. Our cultural differences and our wildly different histories are becoming irrelevant. Discussions of 'representation' in European media, in government, it doesn't matter what backgrounds they have or what European ancestry they might have, it only matters if they are white.

A journalist here in Ireland bemoaned the lack of diversity in the news and cited the presence of 'white men' as the problem. It's ridiculous. If there's anything lacking, it's Polish and Lithuanian representation. Both groups are far more ingrained and common in Ireland than any 'non-white' group. Do people think they look at white people on the screen and feel represented?

It's the most basic and idiotic way of looking at 'diversity'. There's more to the hundreds of different cultural groups in Ireland than skin tone, and reducing Europeans to a shade of skin is incredibly sad for the future if that trend continues.",,/r/europe/comments/guhylz/thousands_join_uk_protests_over_george_floyd_death/fsilpw4/,ProgressMind,1591010331

57,"If there will ever be such a thing (though, for the life of me, I've never understood the necessity for autonomy), the push for autonomy needs to get more reasonable. The bill for autonomy in its current form seeks that the Hungarian language becomes the only language in all institutions and local administration. 

Basically forcing whatever other minority in the Harghita or Covasna to learn Hungarian in order to be able to get around. 

Once that happens, no Hungarian will see the necessity to learn Romanian, as they won't be needing it when they deal with the local administration, in pubs, restaurants when they order food and anywhere else.

The natural compromise here would be to eliminate Romanian as a native language being studied in schools and have it studied as a foreign language. Let's not forget, they'd be a linguistic enclave, surrounded from all sides by regions that speak Romanian. That isolationism will do a lot of harm to them in the future. 

They need to drop that request. But I suspect UDMR has deliberately kept that request in for years, so that they can show to the Szekelys: see, they don't want you to get autonomy.  

&gt;giving autonomy to them would kill nationalism there.

Love the unbiased magyar links i cannot understand

Btw that tree starts in 1508 well to bad that the firsy atestation of this familly is from 1236 under the ""candea"" name 

&gt;And yes Dagffy apperently did have olah ancestors on one side, but I don’t really see the point? 


That like it or not everything in Transilvania waa build only by you, majority of the castles,fortifications etc were build in ethnic diverse areas, and a lot of people of different ethnicities took part in the process of building


&gt;So you managed to point out two of thousands, one of which wasn’t even true?

Actually i pointed 3 :/ and do you know the meaning of ""and so on""


&gt;We just pointed out that whenever there is a pic about “beautiful Romania” it’s alway a pic about a Transylvanian city center built by us in the 19th century

When for the majority of it hungary and Transylvania was under austrian rule, following yout logic tthat claims that this castle build by a vlach familly with tge participation of other vlschs,saxons and magyars as part of the workforce is hugarian dosent that make everything build in the 19th before AH austrian??? Also again i'm sure that absolutely 0 romanians from that juicy majority who inhabited Transylvania cobtributed to the building of this citties it was all on you ;)



&gt; and old town built by us or the saxons,

You mean Sibiu or Sighisoara who was literally borded with Amlas county a Vlach predominant region in the west and in the east Fagaras county who again was known to have a big vlach populstion in the north Alba Iulia and Deva with again predominant Vlach populations, or Brasov who was founded on some bulgarian and vlach villages i'm sure vlachs barely did anything to help

&gt; or an old castle built by us in the middle ages passed off as Romanian
achievements.

Just like this one is an only hungarian achievment :)



&gt;Which is fine you do you, just don’t act so offended when we point that out.

Eliminating visa restrictions for three million people is very significant. Being able to continuously live, study and work in a country is a huge step up from being able to visit for six months and then having to return home and risk arrest by the secret police.

The conditions for renewal of residence are the big unknown here. I would hope for something as simple as ""be in work or study"", but I also suspect that they will depend on exactly how the Communist Party behaves.

The BBC article from which you selectively quote seems to have been written before the details of the offer became clear, and only updated in some places. It was initially thought that only *current* holders of BNO passports would be eligible (a ""small percentage""), but it has since been confirmed otherwise.

The covid-19 crisis has triggered a new debate within Europe about the need for greater supply-chain “diversification”, and thus for a managed disengagement from China. That will not be easy, and it won’t happen quickly. But, clearly, Europe has abandoned its previous ambition for a more closely integrated bilateral economic relationship with China.

In the past, when Europeans sought trade, economic-, and foreign-policy reforms vis-à-vis China, their hope was always to increase contact with the country while making the relationship fairer and more reciprocal. The basic goal was to expand bilateral trade and pry the Chinese market open for European investments. Even when the EU toughened its approach to China, its objective was still to deepen economic ties with the country. The creation of new EU instruments to screen investments and enforce antitrust measures were presented as regrettable but necessary measures to create the political conditions for closer cooperation.",,/r/europe/comments/guewhe/the_end_of_europes_chinese_dream/fsi0pw6/,JackRogers3,1590990632

487,"I’m not used to express my perception of art, my job is project management, computer science and data analytics, but I’ll try to explain, from memory, a little.
   
I’m from western Germany and I still vividly remember the fall of the Berlin Wall. I’d been to Berlin often, so I knew the area back then and I‘ve been there a hundred times since.  
The wrapped Reichstag looked completely implausible to me, from the ground to the sky. It’s huge. But I think I didn’t realize how huge it is until it was gone.  
Jeanne-Claude and Christo temporarily removed a huge object that I was used to see in this place and that my brain expected to be there. They instead put an abstract surrogate in it‘s place, a basic form.  
That changed the perception of the surrounding landscape / space, too. Everything was “wrong” but the color, material and “folding” they chose were non threatening.  
At the same time it was possible to explore the - reduced - form of the Reichstag. All details were hidden under the tarp and what was left was the wrapped form, inviting me to guess the contents like a gift. And that’s what it was. I remember (or am I making them up as a part of me?) some kids in the grass, laughing.  
I was there with a couple of friends from uni, who are now lawyers, scientists, managers, and I remember that we were very happy just sitting there in the grass, with some cans of beer, looking at whatever the Reichstag was temporarily transmogrified into. It looks different now to me, more personal, it’s not just a building anymore.  

Knowing that there will be no more works of Jeanne-Claude and Christo makes me sad. At the same time I’m happy that I had the chance to see two works of them and maybe the work in Paris next year.  
I really didn’t expect this to make such an impression on me, it was *just* a wrapped building.  

But music is *just* wind and a painting is *just* dust, so why did I expect less?",,/r/europe/comments/gu7hep/artist_christo_has_died_at_84_bulgarianborn/fsha8ls/,lisaseileise,1590973671

It's not a question of what they will do, [they already redistribute the loot](https://twitter.com/SophNar0747/status/1266178599079510016)

&gt;If the same person had been killed by a gang in a ghetto nothing would have happened, as it is common with other victims of gang violence. This selective behavior that shows lack of interest for the victim as if the value of his life is differential, depending on the killer is not able to inspire any change.

Well of course people are angrier about the police murdering someone than about gang violence. The police is an organisation that shows the same racist violence across the whole country, gangs are not. And the protest is not just about George Floyd, his murder is only the spark of the outrage that concerns a long history of police brutality.

The systemic causes behind police brutality are also easier to see than those behind gang violence. Capitalism-induced poverty forcing people to become criminals requires a few more steps than police officers straight-up murdering people.

A major problem I see with our perception of poor and oppressed people is the mystification. We tend to perceive them as inherently innocent and good and thus hold them to much higher standards. It is false to expect them to act like saints, as the ability to always act morally and in accordance with the law is unfortunately not something everybody can afford. To survive, many people have to resort to unsavoury measures. It would be nice if all of society's problems could be solved by sitting down at a table and talking everything out. But to sit at that table is a privilege not everyone enjoys.

The South of the US had slavery and then large scale racist legal institutions up until 40-50 years ago. If a group of people feel aggrieved, then situations like this provide an outlet for that by putting a face to a much larger and more complicated set of issues. 

The US has around 800,000 police officers and 330 million people. There's going to be a lot of high profile incidents in the US just because there are way more people. But every time it happens, then that's a high profile emotionally charged news story on the national news. Compare that to France, which has around 220,000 police officers and around 67 million people. Even if the rate of police brutality were the same in the US vs France, then the US would still have 4-5 times as many high profile cases of police brutality and you'd see these things on the news 4-5 times as often.

664,"I meant they will offer nothing in changing things.

&gt;Well of course people are angrier about the police murdering someone than about gang violence. The police is an organisation that shows the same racist violence across the whole country, gangs are not. And the protest is not just about George Floyd, his murder is only the spark of the outrage that concerns a long history of police brutality.  
&gt;  
&gt;The systemic causes behind police brutality are also easier to see than those behind gang violence. Capitalism-induced poverty forcing people to become criminals requires a few more steps than police officers straight-up murdering people.  
&gt;  
&gt;A major problem I see with our perception of poor and oppressed people is the mystification. We tend to perceive them as inherently innocent and good and thus hold them to much higher standards. It is false to expect them to act like saints, as the ability to always act morally and in accordance with the law is unfortunately not something everybody can afford. To survive, many people have to resort to unsavoury measures. It would be nice if all of society's problems could be solved by sitting down at a table and talking everything out. But to sit at that table is a privilege not everyone enjoys. It's not about inspiring change, it's about forcing it.

Gang violence has mainly to do with power. Gangs that operate in ghettos are not after money for their survival. They are responsible of different violent crimes like rapes, killings as part of gang wars...

That's a sick search for power, not an immediate result of poverty. The aim of a gang member is to climb the hierarchy. Have you seen any of those who have made it to the top, to drop out because they have earned money? The answer is no, because money is not the goal as a way for a better life, but as a mean of power for them.

Nothing will fail till the discrimination I describe stops to exist and the victims are not used as tools for promoting the ideas of the rioter, but are the real center of the process of protests, valued as human beings, not reduced to tools in the hands of different circles. And the fact is that nothing has changed with previous riots regarding police violence in the US for a very long time.",,/r/europe/comments/gu1mou/demonstrators_rally_in_europe_in_solidarity_with/fsh09yr/,TravellingAroundMan,1590968006

- everything below 50% is usually a failure, so there's no need to further specify. Maybe have a distinction between ""failure"" and ""didn't even try""

- everything between 50% and 80% is where the bulk of the students will be, and where differentiation is most important for self-reflection and improvement monitoring. Put basically all the grade differences you want in here, e.g. ""just sufficient"", ""below expectations"" ""in line with expectations"", and ""good""

- everything above 80% is exceptional, or possibly a broken system. Mark this as ""excellent"" grade and give an additional award outside of the grading system for 95+%

In this way, municipalities began to carry out all kinds of works (most of them absurd), in order to obtain money from the State. Many of these works were 'to decorate' roundabouts with any valid excuse as a kind of 'art'. The 'motivation' for this one was to commemorate the International Polar Year, whose location is Azuqueca de Henares, near where I live.

We still don’t have real answers to questions about immunity, cross immunity, how long will the thing be with us, how many peaks, will there be a vaccine, if so when, so we can’t really make an informative judgement by now.

I mean if we call it going for herd immunity, the famous Stockholm testing which showed just 7 percent having antibodies is seen by many as proof it’s nit worth it, but we still know very little, about as I said immunity and how long the virus will be with us, and lockdowns can’t stay for ever so it still might prove to be the only way sadly.

So as very late Sunday, May 31st (as some like too dig out old covid related posts weeks/months on Reddit and make fun of them, as if they themselves were prophets :D ) based on current science the attitude seems rather problematic, but can’t really be judged.

That being said, the best attitude retrospectively based on data, at least from Western countries would have been testing, contact tracing and protecting the vulnerable population, while not totally destroying the economy with full scale lockdowns except in places like Bergamo where it got out of control, but not countrywide.

Regarding the structural differences: I hope that the young people that go to the successful industrial countries go back to their home country to start making business. In fact I believe that this is happening to a certain degree. Poland ist a good example how they can become economically successful. 
In the Balkan Region there is a lot going on in tourism. 

I hope that the knowledge that the people get in eg germany flows back to those countries at some time and it is too early to tell. 

At least I have the feeling, that the people do never forget their home and want to go back. Until now there isn’t a lot of money there but maybe it will change. Plus the differences eg Albania-Serbia or France-germany are really decreasing. For the better whole Europe.

897,"&gt;No it's not.

Okay, point me to a protest movement that revolved around destroying their own consumerist goods prior to 2005. If they're older, there will be examples, right?

&gt;It's a form of showing that you're serious about your conviction to the point of self-harm. Certainly much more mild than hunger strikes or self-immolation by the same logic is behind it.

Self-harm excludes harm to your property, it's exclusively used to describe inflicting bodily harm or emotional scarring on yourself. You know why it excludes harm to your property? Because people just laugh at you when you throw your own TV out of the third floor window. 

&gt;Execution of that form of protest isn't very good but it still gives bad press and if you never buy from the same company you hurt their bottom line. That's way better than nothing.

There is no such thing as bad press, especially not in cases like these where right-wingers have already paid for the product and then tell liberals to buy those products too.

899,"There are no tests done at the grad level, as far as I know. There is no actual evidence that university is easier in the South than in the North. You can understand why people think this if you consider that northern universities are usually higher ranked (I'm talking about world university rankings, though I'll admit they're not entirely reliable) and are way harder to get into. 

The most prestigious universities for engineering are in the North. The best universities for medicine are in the North. The best universities for law are either in Rome or in the North. The best universities for math are in the Center/North. By best, I mean they have the best reputation, they're valued more by employers, they offer a wider range of courses, they have the most international students, better researchers, better professors (theoretically, but not necessarily true in my experience), harder exams. So they attract better students. Kind of like Harvard and Yale are better than Arkansas State, for example.

And in these universities it's hard to get the highest grade. Take the Politecnico di Milano for instance, less than 3% graduate summa cum laude.   Now look at any southern university: you'll see that way more students get the highest grade. Thus, a high grade from the Politecnico is worth more, because it's much more difficult to attain. This is what I mean when I say the grades are inflated. There are faculties in the South where over 50% of the students graduate summa cum laude. At this point it kind of loses value.

As for the INVALSI, the incentive is that it influences your middle school final grade, it is taken very seriously, or at least it was when I took it.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; It seems (but I may be wrong) that you are comparing universities to schools when you mention INVALSI. 

Could you clarify what you mean? I mentioned INVALSI because they're a measure of a students' basic academic skills. It's taken in the 8th grade (I think also in the 5th grade). The results that come out of this test are in stark contrast with the graduation grades (high school and university): how is it possible that over 65% of the southern students can't do decently on a standardized test and then so many of them go on to graduate with the highest grade? It happens every year: Apulia and Campania get tons of 100s (perfect grade) for some reason. Is everybody smarter there, or is the bar lower? 

The discrimination is there and it's been a serious issue for hundreds of years. It goes way beyong the university grade, but I can assure you that employers do discriminate against southern universities. This happens because, as I said, it's not uncommon to go to the South if you're not good enough to pass in the North. And good southern students go to the North if they have the means.

The exam is national and it's the same for every public university, but the score required to get in depends on the university you're applying to. You can put up to 10 (I think, not sure) choices when you take the test, and then, based on the score you get, you go where your score allows you to go. The highest grade required is always in Milan/Pavia, the lowest are usually in Sardinia, Calabria, Apulia, Sicily. There would be a lot more to say about the state of southern hospitals, but I don't want to get into that. Just know that no med student wants to study at a southern uni.

And just so you know, some people buy degrees here too.",,/r/europe/comments/gtdx46/pisa_2018_mean_score_in_mathematics_literacy/fsfs8kf/,1_84,1590945020

Furthermore, there are hundreds of deaths by gang violence every year, but again not a single protest. Why? Are the family members of people killed by gang members in less pain than those who were killed by the police?

How the fuck does so similar trash happen at the same time in our countries? Ironic, considering it's usually the ""anti-globalist nationalists"" behind these, actually taking coordinated actions in our region. 

In Estonia, the alt-right party is also pushing their own people to the public broadcaster council. Only in our case, they pushed people with their own ideology to positions that were supposed to be reserved for experts (there are also political positions in the council that they already hold). However, their excuse was that people with their ideology can also be experts (I'd disagree, considering the average brain capacity of their members).

Estonian Public Broadcaster has been rather critical of the government so far, so the alt-right accuses them of ""representing the deep state"" or whatever. According to their logic, the neutrality and professionality of public broadcaster should reflect in a way that they should praise and criticise the government in equal amounts.

1056,Let me tell you this man.it was the erdogan and his stupid ministers narrative which showed it like turkey was pushing the refugees.yes it was a political move to break the agreement and as a turk i supported it because europe left no other choice because of the reasons i mentioned earlier.All erdogan had to do was giving an order to minister about breaking the agreement and the refugees would flood the gates anyways.but he wanted to turn it into a shitshow and branded it as a punishment for those europens who oppose his policies in syria.all of this was a domestic policy in order to show his supporters his capabilities and power.i mean if there was no “pushing” there would be no difference in the numbers of the refugees on the border believe me.as i said turkey did you a favour by keeping this people for many years it was not the erdogan it was the turkish people he was sitting in his 1000 room palace and turkish youth were committing suicide because they were unemployed.so its just very frustrating people bitch you and call you terrible things after you suffer a lot for their comfort.its not their fault that turks suffered its erdogans fault but at least people in here can be kind towards turks.,,/r/europe/comments/gtkbtf/turkey_poll_for_parliament/fsfg704/,cihanthehorse,1590938582

I think they changed for first 3 years to 'must improve'-'good'-'very good' instead of 0-5 a couple years back but I'm not sure. In uni you get FF to AA but prof decides where to put the thresholds, if there is a bell curve or not. There is an automatic FF for below 35 or 45 in most unis though.

You receive a 6 in something when you score 90% or above usually. This is also known as LA or Largement Atteints (Largely Attained)

You receive a 5 in something when you score 75% - 89.9%.
This is also known as AA or Atteints avec Aisance (Easily Attained)

You receive a 4 in something when you score 60% - 74.9%.
This is also known as A or Atteints (Attained)

You receive a 3 in something when you score 45%-59.9%.
This is also known as PA or Partiellement Atteints (Partially Attained)

You receive a 2 in something when you score below 45%.
This is also known as NA or Non Atteints (Not Attained)

At ages 10-11 (Grades 5/6) you sit some tests in French, German, English and Maths. Your score is then calculated using French, Maths and your best scoring subject out of German and English. 

If you score 16-18 you qualify for Voie Secondaire Baccalauréat (VSB or Secondary Baccalaureate Way) which means from Grade 7-9 you can study Greek, Latin, Chemistry, Physics and Biology.

If you score below 16 points you will be put in Voie Secondaire Générale (VSG or Secondary General Way) which means from Grade 7-9 you can study Woodworking, Italian, Sewing and Cooking.

There used to be a VSO but it was canned a few years ago due to discrimination these students felt. They were more aimed towards gearing up for Apprenticeships in the craft trades for less academically gifted students.

Depending on your score at the end of Year 7 and Year 9 you can move up or down between VSB and VSG. 13 points in VSB causes you to repeat the year in VSG, 16 points in VSG causes you to repeat the year in VSB.",Hampshire County - United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/gtwct1/grading_systems_used_in_european_countries_w/fsf3xhr/,Zephinism,1590930737

1197,"&gt;A Belgian prince has contracted coronavirus after attending a party during lockdown in Spain, the country's royal palace says.  
&gt;  
&gt;Prince Joachim, 28, travelled from Belgium to Spain for an internship on 26 May, the palace said.  
&gt;  
&gt;Two days later, he went to a party in the southern city of Córdoba, before testing positive for Covid-19.  
&gt;  
&gt;Spanish reports suggest the prince, a nephew of Belgium's King Philippe, was among 27 people at the party.  
&gt;  
&gt;Under Córdoba's lockdown rules, a party of this size would be a breach of regulations, as gatherings of no more than 15 people are currently permitted.  
&gt;  
&gt;How lockdown is being lifted across Europe  
&gt;  
&gt;Spain's capital Madrid adjusts to new normal  
&gt;  
&gt;Spanish police have launched an investigation into the party. Those found to have flouted lockdown rules could be fined up to €10,000 (£9,000; $11,100).  
&gt;  
&gt;Everyone who attended the party is said to be in quarantine. Prince Joachim, the youngest son of Princess Astrid and 10th in line to the Belgian throne, is said to have mild coronavirus symptoms.  
&gt;  
&gt;Rafaela Valenzuela, a representative of the Spanish government in Córdoba, condemned the party, calling those who attended ""irresponsible"".  
&gt;  
&gt;""I feel surprised and angry. An incident of this type stands out at a moment of national mourning for so many dead,"" she said.  
&gt;  
&gt;The party was first covered by Spanish newspaper El Confidencial, which cited a document from the Andalucian authorities but did not name the prince.  
&gt;  
&gt;Belgian media have since confirmed with the palace that Prince Joachim was in Spain, where he remains.  
&gt;  
&gt;The prince is known to have a long-standing relationship with a Spanish woman, reported to be Victoria Ortiz.  
&gt;  
&gt; Spain is in the process of emerging from one of the strictest  lockdowns in Europe. It outlined a four-stage plan on 4 May to start  easing the lockdown, which saw children under 14 confined to their homes  for six weeks.  
&gt;  
&gt;The country said it was moving to a second phase  from 1 June for 70% of Spaniards, leaving only major cities under  tighter restrictions.  
&gt;  
&gt;Spain has among the highest number of  coronavirus cases and deaths in the world. As of Saturday, the country  had 239,228 infections and 27,125 deaths, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.

Also, the best universities are all in the North or in the Center: the Polytechnics of Milan and Turin, University of Bologna, Milan, Pisa, Rome, Trieste. There are some good unis in the South too, such as the University of Naples Federico II, but they are few and far between. A lot of southern students know this, so they go study in the North after high school. Very few people do the opposite, and usually it's people who failed the entrance exams for med schools in the North, which are way more competitive.

1407,"&gt;Putin is not hostile to EU

When did EU military provovocate Russia by violating airspace or sea zones? When did EU stage a conventional offensive attack in the Baltics, or stage a Nuclear attack on Poland? When did EU kill Russian citizens on Russian Soil? When did EU meddle in Russian elections? When did EU fund Russian extremist parties? When did EU support rebels and invade neighbouring countries? Never, that was all Russia towards the EU or its neighbors. If you don't want sanctions, the only direct 'hostile' response the EU has done, than maybe don't do those things.

&gt;As a people,we don't have negative view on EU,but we happen to learn that you can't be trusted as a govements.

On the other hand, I will provide some actual sources for my claim (that there were slaves in the roman army):

Here is an excerpt from a book by Jonathan Roth on the [Logistics of the Roman army at war](https://books.google.lt/books?id=LfRiXN5hhCUC&amp;pg=PA105&amp;lpg=PA105&amp;dq=slaves+roman+army&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vAzw9U-t_j&amp;sig=ACfU3U3I-gw1D19onIzjopeDd2Znue389g&amp;hl=lt&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjtv4fywt3pAhWKxIsKHdsLBZkQ6AEwDXoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=slaves%20roman%20army&amp;f=false):

""Since the roman army did not rely on private merchants or sutlers  for the bulk of its logistical support, military slaves must have performed at least some of the non-combatant roles"".

""At times the sources refer to these military slaves by the normal latin words for unfree persons: servi, servitia, etc."" 
Also colones for public(disputed, might be private) owned military slaves. 

""There is no question that there were private slaves who were brought along by officers and sometimes by rank and file soldiers""

""Although as slaves they did not count, technically on the army rolls they appear to have been considered, in a very real sense, a part of the army"".

Aah... yes, uh.. well, you see...   
The EU could off course do exactly what the Trump/BoJo propaganda machines would like us to do, but there are a few problems with that:     

-The Trump/BoJo administrations are based on Political Science (where the results are supposed to mean what I think it should mean, therefore no reason to explain any of it), while the EU prefers to base their decisions on the immutable laws of Physics.          
*Getting the same results from the same inputs, even when using a different font or lots of exclamation marks, is highly confusing for some people.*

1582,"&gt; Their aim was to make the people happy 

Not quite.

You're right that Christianity was very popular, and very widespread, but by the time Constantine issued the edict of Milan, it is believed it was not the majority religion. The goal of Constantine and following Roman Emperors in adopting and then promoting Christianity was to create a unified, centralized power structure that could bind the people to the authority of Rome. You have to remember that Constantine took power only a few decades after the Crisis of the Third Century, when the empire nearly collapsed because of conflicting interests and regional dissatisfaction. 

Constantine was well aware that the Empire did not have anything that truly unified it. Language was split between Greek in the East and Latin in the West, the official languages, but regions still had their own (Punic, Aramaic, Coptic, Celtic, etc.); religion varied from location to location; taxation was not unified, being performed by tax farmers; and the legions, while notionally loyal to Rome, had shown to be very fickle.

Constantine understood the power of a single organized religion that had local power bases (the bishops) which could serve as intermediaries between the Emperor and his subjects, reducing, in theory if not in reality, the distance between emperor and his subjects. And since Christianity was the only monotheistic religion that had spread throughout the whole empire, it was an easy choice to make.

The monotheism part is important, since a single God, and a single church, meant a single set of rules. Hellenic polytheism was notoriously changeable depending on location. It is telling that one of the first things Constantine did was to call [a council of all the Christian bishops at Nicaea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Council_of_Nicaea), in order to determine what was orthodoxy and what was heresy. This can be seen as more than just theological arguments, since a religion without a clearly defined right and wrong would defeat the purpose of what Constantine was trying to accomplish.",Italy,/r/europe/comments/gthref/roman_road_construction_illustration/fsdvnby/,xepa105,1590894417

UKIP originated in England, and the most popular party in England, the Tories, called the referendum because they were afraid of losing votes to UKIP in their English base. And obviously the BBC has to cover this phenomenon, and many newspapers have their base in England. If not for all this media coming from England, there wouldn't have been any meaningful political discourse about the possibility of leaving the EU in Scotland at all, it would be just like in Ireland.

England, not Scotland, has time and time again in the last few elections voted for the Tories, who push for policy for leaving the EU. In every single constituency the majority of Scots voted to stay in the EU and has since voted overwhelmingly for pro-EU parties.

1770,"In 2018 I holidayed in Spain for the first time. Before we chose the destination, my girlfriend composed a short list of areas which met her criteria (proximity to the coast, mountains, good restaurants etc.). At the time I had a Spanish colleague, so I showed him the list in the hope that he'd narrow it down for me. Without hesitation, he pointed to one of the areas and remarked ""I certainly wouldn't go there. I've been there myself, and there's a town just a twenty minute drive away which is very popular with chavs. They get drunk, make a mess, and as a result the locals don't want Brits there"".

Similarly to /u/Golfhacker27, I have experience living in a rural area which has experienced a significant population increase following the expansion of the EU in 2004 and 2007. Like certain areas of Europe which have attracted poor calibre tourists from the UK, my village has attracted poor calibre workers from across central and eastern Europe. It's a generalisation, but many of those who've moved into my community from Lithuania, Poland and Romania etc. are what we'd call chavs. Many don't behave, and as a result they've had a detrimental impact on the quality of our lives.

I would have been eleven or twelve when Polish workers began moving into my village. I'd cycle to school at 7 am and would have to navigate my way around Polish guys who'd passed out in the middle of the road the night before. Some of them were laid there, still clutching a bottle of vodka. This has happened several dozen times, and sadly a Polish guy working in the local agri sector drank too much one night and was found dead on the pavement by the village postman one morning a few years ago. I've seen locals drink a cider or two too many at the local pub, but nothing like that. There were drunken brawls outside people's homes in the early hours of the morning, lots of noise and some nasty injuries - we weren't used to this behaviour.

In 2014, things went downhill quite quickly around here. Without wishing to cause offence, I attribute this mainly to the growing numbers of Romanian immigrants who settled in the area. I was born in 1993, and between then and 2014 neither myself or any member of my family had been the victim of a crime. Since 2014 Romanians have broken into and damaged property belonging to my parents on five occasions, and I had my own property broken into by a Romanian just a fortnight before the 2016 EU Referendum. You can probably guess by now which way I voted.

I've met many courteous Poles and Romanians, and have had the good fortune to visit both of these countries. The problem I have is that my community doesn't attract normal people from these countries who behave normally. Instead we scrape the barrel and attract the lowest of the low. Since 2016, a significant number of these people have either returned to their home nation or moved elsewhere in Europe, and things have really improved.

It simply shows the mandated by law age when you can retire and he get some form of relatively 'decent' state pension.

If a Swede works from 20 to 65 because of great labour participation in Sweden and low unemployment, and lots of jobs and business opportunities, then that's 45 years of contributing to the national pension fund.

If a Spaniard works from 30 to 65 that's 35 years of contributing to the pension fund, due not soo great job opportunities for example, high unemployment, etc..

The current high unemployment in Spain shows that the labour participation and hence contributions to the national pension fund, is not great for Spain when compared with Sweden.

I personally, I don't think that Sweden or any other highly productive economy in Sweden, should be on the hook for bad policies in Southern Europe (corruption, pet projects of politicians, high tax evasion, high black economy, low investment in the research and development areas, etc..).

However we have lots of exceptions where the best example of this is banan (eng: track or road) which is pronounced with a long vowel at the first **a** and a short vowel at the second **a**. And we have banan (eng: banana. wich is pronounced with a short vowel at the first **a** and a long at the second.

2229,"This article is missing some very important points. Yes, Sweden has a high death rate, but most of those deaths can be traced to things other than the lack of a lock-down. It is absolutely not clear that forcing children to stay home from school, or ask people to wear face masks in public, would have lowered the death rate by any significant amount.

Ever since the social distancing measures took effect, the rate of hospitalizations and deaths has gone down consistently; that's a fact. The peak in early April was significantly higher than in our neighbours, that's true. But because the inherent delay between actions and results, that peak was *already inevitable* by March, the time both Sweden and our neighbours introduced countermeasures. So you cannot blame the *height* of the peak on those countermeasures, only its rate of decline afterwards.

So why was the peak so much higher? Well, that will probably be the topic of much debate in the future, but part of it seems to be that we had to ration PPE because the regional governments had abolished the strategic reserves, that the people working in elderly care in Stockholm didn't have access to sick pay and were forced to work even with symptoms, and quite simply because we had more cases already in February than our neighbours. And none of these things can be blamed on the Public Health Authority or Dr. Tegnell, of course.

In my opinion the reasoning behind the countermeasures is, and remains, sound: Young children and asymptomatic people don't spread the disease much, so keeping them home has little effect except for worsening their school results. Wearing masks in public doesn't protect you from getting the disease, only from spreading it. So if you're asymptomatic, wearing a mask has no effect except for worsening the mask shortage. The disease spreads most in clusters, so preventing people from travelling across the country to a festival has a huge effect, which is why public events like festivals were banned in early March. But prohibiting you from going to your local restaurant for lunch doesn't do much except trash the economy. The policy makes sense. As well it should, since it's been drafted by a group consisting of literally 100% scientists and 0% politicians.",,/r/europe/comments/gtd86g/swedens_coronavirus_experiment_has_well_and_truly/fsb9yct/,my_two_pence,1590852184

Patten had judged that: ""People in Hong Kong are perfectly capable of taking a greater share in managing their own affairs in a way that is responsible, mature, restrained, sensible"".[22] During the final days of British rule, the British wanted to play the political game; the Patten administration legislated for labour rights and collective bargaining.",Portugal,/r/europe/comments/gsoah6/eu_not_in_mood_to_follow_trump_into_china/fsba5fo/,Dozed12,1590852541

Also the thought of architecture not being art is detached from the literal forms in architecture. The form very much being subject to change and innovation and not being constrained to a literal box. In the words of a smarter man:

 Architects are in charge of the FORM of the built environment, not its content... Architecture is NOT ART although FORM is our specific contribution to the evolution of world society. We need to understand how new forms can make a difference for the progress of world civilization.

Suppose the  ICJ rules that the Joint Declaration is valid, and China has materially breached it?

&gt;European migrants paid substantially more in taxes to the government than they took in benefits or public services in 2016-17. The report estimated that European migrants made a total contribution of £4.7bn to the public finances in 2016-17. “There is no doubt that EEA migrants are paying more in taxes than they receive in benefits,” it said.  An average adult migrant from one of the original 13 EU member states (excluding the UK and Ireland) contributed £3,740 more to Britain’s exchequer than an average UK citizen; an eastern European migrant accession countries paid an average of £1,040 more. Richer, younger migrants with fewer children were of greatest financial benefit. The research showed that young employees earning £50,000, for example, paid £20,000 more in taxes than they received in state spending.

&gt; Average annual hours worked is defined as the total number of hours actually worked per year divided by the average number of people in employment per year. Actual hours worked include regular work hours of full-time, part-time and part-year workers, paid and unpaid overtime, hours worked in additional jobs, and exclude time not worked because of public holidays, annual paid leave, own illness, injury and temporary disability, maternity leave, parental leave, schooling or training, slack work for technical or economic reasons, strike or labour dispute, bad weather, compensation leave and other reasons. The data cover employees and self-employed workers. This indicator is measured in terms of hours per worker per year. The data are published with the following health warning: The **data are intended for comparisons of trends over time; they are unsuitable for comparisons of the level of average annual hours of work for a given year, because of differences in their sources and method of calculation.**

2461,"You've brought also South Tyrol up, which was nothing more than a general argument for autonomy. Your Vojvodina is a bit closer to the situation in Romania, because it adresses the Hungarian part, but it is still not the same situation as in Romania. You have said it yourself, the Hungarians in Romania depict a larger group than those in Serbia and they are not connected geographically to Hungary. Also according to you the Serbian ones were not causing problems to get what they want. That's also how I imagine a successful attempt at autonomy looks like. If someone had a feeling of ""the enemy in the middle of our country"" from this situation in Romania, I cannot blame them for it. I just try to imagine if Turks in Germany would want to claim autonomy and it is not appealing at all, even though Turkey is so far away. I won't roll up the facts about WW1 again, since you seem to have made your mind up, despite what happened. Hungary was also at fault for the war. The true Hungarians, the ones in power had decided so. The same way you do not excuse the astrocities of the Hungarians against their minorities, I also do not excuse whatever has been done to the Hungarians. But what happened is also not to be blamed on the actual generation of Romania, which have not even been borned around those times.

No criticism whatsoever is allowed is automatically dismissed as being irrational hate. 

 The EU is indeed in a broken state, because of half implemented integration, that's hard to disagree with. But the price for full integration is too high, especially since there is no European ""nation"", you can't expect people, not just countries, the general population, to go along with this without nation building. You speak of the EP as if it represents the people, it doesn't represent me. How could it. My country only has a marginal influence and without nation building, there is no European ""us"", nobody knows who these people are because there is no common European media/cultural sphere. So why would I look at it from another perspective than a national one?  
  
As far having a frank discussion, yes. That's long overdue and getting more and more critical. It's obvious that different countries have different views on what the EU is and what it should become.

2654,"&gt;The French president argued that the enlargement process was “too bureaucratic” and “automatic” and should give existing member states more power to reverse the process if the situation in candidate countries deteriorated. 

Look at Poland and Hungary, for example. They went from aspiring to join the EU to opposing its authority quite fast. If there's already much discussion on the subject of redistribution, adding half a dozen net receivers would only make things worse. The balkans are quite uncooperative with each other, no doubt that a premature EU membership would mean that decision making within the EU gets infinitely complicated.

For countries and people interested in success of the project, that's an obvious ""not right now please"". EU institutions, counter-intuitively, can't be counted on to defend themselves, or at least the ideals they represent. There's a lot of trash in the EU bodies.

2712,"Romania has a large industrial port, with oil terminals, container terminals, grains terminals, Constanta. There are talks about privatising that and the dutch would like a dutch company to control that port. This way, that port cannot become a competitor for ports in rhe Western side of Europe. Not that it can, in a short amount of time, but in the long run. 

If you look at a map, ships coming from India/China would have a shorter route through Constanta than going all the way to Rotterdam, after clearing the Suez. So a truck carrying containers/oil/grain/etc would have easier access to this side of Europe, than going all around. 

This is one of the reasons the Chinese invested heavily in Greek ports. 

Adding to that, Constanta has also direct access to the Danube, the biggest river in Europe and one of the main commercial arteries. River ships can get to the same port that sea vessels can. This is a unique advantage. 

So you could unload river cargo straight into an ocean vessel and the other way around. This will create major competetive advantages for this port.

Plus I am sure there are other economical reasons. 

For instance joining NATO required us to give a highway contract to Bechtel. A few billions later, Bechtel left and no highway is there. Of course our corrupt politicians also played a part in that. But the idea is nothing comes free.

You can make the argument that migrants are more poor than the general population and are thus more crime prone and you would be perfectly right.

Instead the argument that is running rampant in r/europe is that the difference in culture is responsible for the crime rate. Always without proof because it's just racist horseshit.

""Don't you worry!"" cried the moustached man with a hearty laugh, who was Steve (owner of ""Steve's Italian Ice-Cream Parlor (In Italy)"") , because he could discern from Obama's wisdom Obama's supposition, and knew that it was not distinctly not kosher (in the non culinary sense). ""I am not planning to cannibalize or eat any of you to mix with my ice-cream.""

""Oh phew!"" said Malia wiping her forehead.

The Spanish progressively restricted and ly outright forbade the enslavement of Native Americans in the early years of the Spanish Empire with the Laws of Burgos of 1512 and the New Laws of 1543. The latter led to the abolition of the Encomienda, private grants of groups of Native Americans to individual Spaniards and their Mestizo descendants.[1] The implementation of the New Laws and liberation of tens of thousands of Native Americas led to a number of rebellions and conspiracies by ""Encomenderos"" (Encomienda holders) which had to be put down by the Spanish Crown.[2] Asians (chinos) in colonial Mexico had the same status as Native Americans and thus were forbidden to be enslaved by law.[3]

The Crown attempted to limit the bondage of indigenous people, rejecting slavery based on race.

An autonomous region similar to the one I proposed for Székelyföld already exist in the form Vojvodina which is next to Hungary and cooperates with Serbia, was never even threatened to be annexed not even during the Balkan Wars where Hungary aided Croatia, proves that nobody wants to annex anything, this clearly shows that your argument has no basis and is completely idiotic.",Hungary,/r/europe/comments/gqe3x8/in_hungary_people_older_than_65_years_cannot_shop/fs94lcw/,Barna333,1590794682

Everything but the south-west of Slovakia is very hilly, or to be precise, mountains. The south-west of Slovakia is the only place with flat land and its also place with large concentrated population. So they just build NPP in relative proximity to Bratislava because it would make no sense to build NPP for some bača and his sheeps in Tatras. Maybe only if they wanted him to go really hardcore into parenica, korbačiky and bryndza production, which I wholly support.

With Czechia, its a bit more complicated. Czech population is relatively equally distributed. There are large population centers (Praha, Brno, Ostrava), but they are not concentrated in a single part of CR and distributed quite well.

On top of it, as /u/kolima points out, North of CR had mountains rich on coal. The most famous is probably Ostrava, but Mostecko is huge as well, just lacks the associated metal industry and proximity to population centers (but Prague is not far away) and the Vltava has number of dams close to Prague, so its fine as well.

So really, from the POV of ČR, the place is not really that strange. There is another planed NPP to be build close to Ostrava (which I wholly support), but it never got past the planning stage.

For those who say Trump is just an anomaly and to focus on China, the time he's in power does count, especially if it's for four more years, the duration of such a potential conflict.

As soon as Trump is out, than the EU and US can start finally doing something (because not all Americans are Trump supporters), but not before.

3384,"&gt;If we wanted to pump money around for the sake of pumping it around, we wouldn’t have waited for a pandemic. It’s insulting that you’d even say that.

Don't be so quick to be insulted. 

If you look at how the commission proposal you will see that a lot of money does not go to Spain or Italy. If the objective is to help a well-defined set of countries with limited ability to lend money, i.e. Italy and Spain, get through a nasty recession, why on earth would the other 25 EU countries receive grants as well? The Netherlands, Sweden, Austria, Germany, and so on all receive grants. Eastern Europe receives massive grants. This is what I refer to with the pumping around of money for purposes unrelated to the problem we're supposed to be solving. A prime example of the expensive and schizophrenic policy that has become a hallmark of Brussels. 

&gt;You profit extremely from the bloc, and it’s not because you’re special, nothing against the Netherlands, but if you think this wasn’t what you signed up for, then you’re not that bright. 

Every electorate was sold a different version of reality on what the EU is and is not. The treaties help clarify what are real agreements and what are non-binding declarations of intent. 

That said everyone profits from the EU and the single market in particular, trade is a win-win proposition. This is also very true for an export oriented economy like Italy.

By the strict definition of what the union is, my assessment is correct. By what the Dutch electorate was sold, my assessment is correct. Consensus decision making (i.e. veto rights) ensure even a small country like the Netherlands cannot be forced to comply with policies it does not want to comply with. Combined this provides justification for and ability to just reject this commission proposal out of hand. 

&gt;This is not about Italy’s fiscal situation, this is about the consequences of the pandemic. Italy has never asked for money, quite the contrary actually, but now there are those that need help, and the fact that you’re not willing to give it really makes the 4 unworthy of this union.

Unworthy of the union you would like the EU to be, not unworthy of the union the EU _is_. These four countries happen to strictly follow all EU rules, unlike some other member states. I applaud your enthusiasm for a different and more close union, but that next level of integration will not happen with all 27 member states. 

W.r.t. Italy's fiscal situation. It is about that. The pandemic is a synchronous shock, i.e. we all got hit hard economically, yet the ability of a government to offer fiscal stimulus is asynchronous, i.e. some countries can lend more easily than others. The vast majority of the EU nations are handling the response to the pandemic perfectly fine at the national level. If Italy and Spain had lower debts, in accordance with the stability and growth pact, we would not be having this discussion. 

Surely it is undeniable that the high debt-to-gdp rates are the problem here? While we can have a meaningful discussion about why those debt-to-gdp rates are so high and what role the single currency has played in that and if there is European policy that's hampering growth and hence should be changed, it is surely also undeniable that choices the electorates and political classes within these countries themselves have consistently made are primarily responsible for their high debts?",The Netherlands,/r/europe/comments/gs313t/the_eus_750_billion_plan_to_recover_from_covid19/fs7fw51/,I_really_like_Cheese,1590764792

You can just see that a Giga is nothing more and nothing less than a number.
Now numbers have wonderful properties, especially when you relate them through an operation called multiplication.
For example, we can multiply 1.000.000.000 by 0,000.000.001 to get 1 or, to put it in other terms a gigapico.
That's exactly 1 Giga multiplied by 1 pico.
As simple as that.

Once again, it was said that Greece had cooked its books so as to enter the euro area: again this became a headline and was adopted by many politicians.

Translation (by google, but I had to fix it from some broken places as it gets confused easily):

Mart Kuus, an Estonian mushroom seller arrested in Helsinki, claims that the whole incident was caused by black money and tax fraud.

Last Thursday, August 13, Kuus tried to sell chanterelles at the Helsinki Market Square. As he did not have a trading license, the market stewards called the police. In the ensuing battle, six Finnish police officers and an Estonian Kuus took part, both sides were injured.

Mart Kuus, why didn't you have a marketing authorization?

""For 20 years, essentially since Finland began to transport forest products from Estonia, no Estonian has received a sales permit there. Permits are issued by an official of the Helsinki City Government, and the application is answered only as ""rejected"".

""Actually, I didn't want to sell these mushrooms there, but to create a discussion about how Finnish intermediaries are deceiving Finnish buyers and the tax authorities,"" said Kuus. ""Although I immediately offered to pay 1,000 euros on the spot, in addition to possible fines, the police were still called.""

Mart Kuus, explain why Estonians do not get a trading permit on the Finnish market?

According to Mart Kuus, there has been a giant black market behind the matter for decades, the participants of which do not want to let others on the market.

""First of all, forest products from Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Belarus are sold to Finns as Finnish , because Finns are willing to pay much more out of patriotism for local goods,"" said Mart Kuus.

Kuus said that Finnish dealers buy berries and mushrooms cheaply from the south and repack them in order to market them as local products. With such a mechanism, a profit of up to 20 euros per kilogram of mushrooms can be made. According to Kuus, this money is skillfully hidden from the tax office using various techniques.

""Finland has a tradition of selling berries and mushrooms per liter, 1 liter contains about 200g of mushrooms. Finnish wholesalers only buy large mushrooms because they fit less in a liter. 1 liter of chanterelles costs 5 euros,"" Kuus explained the prices of Finnish mushrooms.

“A total of 3.5-4 euros per kilogram of mushrooms is bought in Estonia. One kilogram of mushrooms makes about five liters of two hundred gram mushrooms. A liter of mushrooms costs five euros on the Finnish market, so 1 kg costs 25 euros. This gives a profit of 20 euros per kilo of mushrooms,"" calculates Mart Kuus.

""Do they pay taxes from those sales? They Don't! ” said Kuus. ""The daily turnover of Cantharellus cibarius mushrooms in the central market of Helsinki alone is 3-4 tons, ie 75-100,000 euros! The monthly turnover of the Helsinki market is at least five million euros. ""

In total, tens of millions of euros are circulating in this business, which Kuus considers to be a sufficient factor that such harsh measures were used against him. Kuus do not believe that ordinarily police officers would have taken such drastic measures, the order had to come from above.

""If the monthly turnover of the Helsinki market reaches 5 million euros, then it goes without saying that no native Estonian will be allowed on the market,"" Kuus describes the attitude of the Finns. ""They use all sorts of tools to keep us out of this business.""

As Kuus did not obey the orders of the police, they used pepper spray, a rubber stick and, according to Kuus, even a telescopic stick. Kuus resisted, causing at least one police officer to be injured: a broken tooth and head wounds requiring sutures.

Kuus is suspected of causing minor injuries and resisting the authorities. According to Kuus, his case is currently being handled by his lawyer.",Estonia,/r/europe/comments/gs2w81/police_per_100000_inhabitants/fs66206/,kingpool,1590730099

3962,"Anyway, you don’t seem to want to answer my question. So let me answer it to you. It’s not exactly a “free” choice, as you said. Some countries are simply unable to provide the support needed, not because they don’t want to, but because they can’t. But why can’t they? Well, you know exactly why, which is why you’re not answering.

They can’t because they already have too high public debt levels. And why do they have too high public debt levels? Because of past national decisions. The EU begged them and repeatedly told them to lower their debts (so that in case of crisis they would have available headroom) but they refused, or they moved too slowly to decrease debt levels. Those are all national decisions.

They are constrained only because of their own past national decisions. Yet somehow to you that’s the fault of the EU, or in any case an EU problem? Of course not. That’s a national problem, caused by national decisions.

Also, even more importantly. Can you tell me what the national public debt is? Don’t answer, I’ll do it for you: the national public debt is nothing but the sum of all past public balances (deficits and surpluses, obviously with different signs).

So, if now, in 2020, having a big public deficit and supporting your economy massively (like Germany is doing) is “market distorting”, then the same holds true for past years too. Having an intervention of 10% of GDP (10% deficit) or more in a single year, or having an intervention of 1% (1% deficit) for 10 years has the exact same “market distorting” effect. 

It also comes to reason that having a 1% surplus is also “market distorting”, but in the opposite sense: the State is removing resources from the private economy, so instead of supporting the economy, you are actually putting a burden on the economy, holding the economy back. 

Germany has had a budget surplus since 2014 at least, almost every single year bigger than 1%. So Germany has distorted the market by removing more than 6% (1% * 6 years) of GDP = -6% of GDP distortion...then we look at Italy, where the deficit since 2014 almost never descended below 2%, so we distorted the private economy by offering a lot of support, more than 12% (2% * 6 years) = +12% of GDP distortion.

One country provided +12% of GDP support for its economy since 2014, another removed -6% of GDP of resources from the economy. Talk about “market distortion”. The difference between the support provided by Italy to its economy and the “penalty” imposed by Germany on its economy is very very significant.

So what we’re actually seeing now is a rebalancing of that situation, of the situation of the last years. Italy (and some other countries) provided support to the economy for all these years in “limited” amounts each year while Germany (and some other countries) kept a brake on its economy for all these years, all of which caused a big market distortion in favour of Italy (and the others like it). Now instead, Germany (and some other countries) is providing massive support to the economy in a single year, while Italy (and some other countries) is unable to provide the massive stimulus that Germany is doing, but simply increase the stimulus somewhat, all of which is causing a big market distortion in favour of Germany (and the others like it). Summing the 2 periods together, you have a mostly balanced situation.

But of course the effects, the results, are very different. And we know exactly which option is the better one. Keynes taught us this a long time ago. The road chosen by Germany and others has much more positive economic results than the one chosen by Italy (and others).

Still, it’s true that the money provided yearly by Italy (and others) was provided in accordance to State Aid rules, while the money that Germany (and others) is providing now is not bound by those State Aid rules, so the market distorting effect is not equal, not 1€ = 1€, but you surely did not make your point by providing an in-depth analysis of all these different but very fundamental points and a quantitative and qualitative impact assessment of the market distorting effects to actually reach a conclusion on whether Italy (and others) or Germany (and others) distorted the market more. You just simply preferred to assume that it’s the distortion happening right now that’s more significant.

And again, Italy and those other countries that do not have a “choice” now and cannot implement a 10% of GDP support to the economy right now (without having to worry about State Aid rules) can’t do so because of their own past decisions and no one else’s. We have a saying in Italy that tells: “chi è causa del suo mal pianga sé stesso”, which I think translates to: “he who makes his bed must lie in it.”

And anyway, the decision to suspend State Aid rules was approved by all Member States, and they knew very well that each country would have a different “firepower” to support its economy.

4004,"Yet the countries that least need it are the only ones whose stimulus values even come close to the US values.

Which is my entire point. Cohesion policy my ass - this will lead to the complete and total opposite. 

The EU stimulus is macroeconomically insignificant, the only good it does is set a good precedent. Even without being watered down, it's still less than 0.75% of GDP *per year*. That is a paper tiger, to say the least. 

State aid rules are suspended, so what do some countries do? Inject large amounts into their companies, while the rest of the EU suffers, unable to compete against those massive cash flow injections and resulting competitive advantage. The rich grow richer, the poor grow poorer.

I predict over the next few months/years we'll be seeing a lot of cross-border acquisitions of weaker countries' companies by those companies that are now getting massive injections from their respective states.

Also, there is no country that approaches the 10% GDP immediate stimulus of the US. Deferrals and delayed stimulus are currently being negotiated and it is very doubtful the values won't be significant. Expect Germany's totals to be dwarfed by them.

And yes, we're talking a 10% GDP *immediate* stimulus. Not 3%. Not over 4 years. Not partially loans. Not partially deferrals. Direct, immediate stimulus. Even Germany did only about 5%, and all other EU countries dwarf Germany.

Individual actions performed by countries separately have nothing to do with cohesion policy. So even if these individual actions were to “lead to the complete and total opposite”, actually, since they have nothing to do with cohesion policy, they wouldn’t lead to the opposite, because they’re not supposed to take care of cohesion anyway. 

The EU stimulus is not “macroeconomically insignificant”. Just because it is not at the level of the US one doesn’t mean that it is “macroeconomically insignificant”.

Also, what’s this fetishism with what the US is doing? Would you really prefer the EU to do as the US did? Do you realise that over 40 million Americans lost their jobs and are unemployed now (so they not only lost their jobs, but their healthcare insurance too, most probably), compared to waaaay less than 5 million Europeans who lost their jobs (but they still have healthcare costs taken care of)?

Just throwing money at the problem is not the answer, especially if your purpose is to actually help normal people, poor and middle-class people. And that should be obvious for anyone that actually compares US and EU numbers during this crisis.

4051,"Yes, and the national stimulus is incredibly uneven and biased towards rich countries that need it the least. It will be incredibly counterproductive in terms of cohesion, and in normal times *would have been prohibited by treaty*. State aid rules exist - they've been suspended. 

Consider the type of market distortions caused by a rich country injecting 60% of its GDP in its economy over the next few years, and a poor country only 5%. Taking into account the differences in GDP, it might be a difference of a factor of 60 or more.

Why do you think this sort of thing isn't usually allowed? Because it just leads to the rich getting richer, and the poor getting poorer. It's unfair, it distorts the market and prevents free competition by giving some companies an unfair advantage, and it leads to the poorer countries' companies being swallowed up by those rich countries' companies in the long run, digging the poor countries deeper into the hole they're trying to get out of.

There is a reason for the cohesion policy, for these state aid rules.

4063,"Translation :

On Thursday evening, the Sejm adopted the Public Aid Act.  At the last moment, an amendment by the Lewica (The Left) was introduced to it, which limits the remuneration for CEOs and directors in companies that benefited from the assistance.

""The Sejm has just adopted my amendment to the act on public aid. In companies rescued by the budget, the president's obscenely high salaries will be banned. If a company takes public funds, it cannot spend them on the boss's expenses!""  - one of the Lewica MPs and the leader of the Razem party Adrian Zandberg wrote on Twitter.

He also added, not without irony, that ""sometimes the strength of arguments works even in the Sejm.""  This is because their amendment was voted as a minority request.  However, it was supported by all 227 PiS deputies, 5 Civic Coalition, the entire Lewica and one PSL-Kukiz'15 deputy.

* High energy water flows, these are concentrated in wet and/or snowy mountainous regions. Large continental rivers (high flow) are also an option but not necessarily ideal (low flow velocities and elevation changes).

* Lack of extreme dry seasonality

* Low evapotranspiration, usually related to higher latitudes (closer to the polar regions, irrespective of humidity).

* Ability to route water discharges between points of vastly different elevations (doesn't have to be across the dam structure)

* Deep valleys with sturdy geology for secure dams and efficient water storage and low populations to minimize displaced communities.

This explains why hydro output in Europe is concentrated in Norway, the Alpine countries, Balkans and Anatolia. Italy and Spain, for instance, are too dry despite being mountainous. UK is too flat overall (almost all hydro is in Wales and Scotland). Russia and Ukraine have the large continental rivers, but are very flat.

&gt; European Commission President Says he Spoke to Leaders of Other Planets about Brexit
&gt;
&gt;In a speech before the European Parliament discussing the consequences of the Brexit vote, the President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, made the stunning comment that he had spoken about it to “leaders of other planets.” Juncker’s comment suggests that world leaders are in communication with extraterrestrials, which closely monitor global events and assess their geopolitical and ‘exopolitical’ impact.

-

&gt; Also, at several points in his speech, Junckers makes references to himself as a “human being” and not a robot or a machine, suggesting that some in his intended audience are not human as one native French speaker has noted in translating and interpreting his comments in a helpful thread on the Project Avalon Forum.

-

&gt;There are two scenarios I wish to raise here.
&gt;
&gt;One is that extraterrestrials require global unity as a precondition for revealing themselves to humanity, or having their existence disclosed. If so, then the effect of  Brexit is one of slowing down the process of global political unification, thereby delaying any official announcement of extraterrestrial life.

-

&gt; The second scenario is that the European Union is a façade for a Nazi Fourth Reich which has secretly made alliances with a group of extraterrestrials called “Draconians.” A retired aerospace engineer, William Tompkins, has provided documents supporting his claims that he participated in a covert U.S. Navy program with 29 spies in Nazi Germany who had discovered that the Third Reich had made secret agreements with Draconians.

&gt; Popalloff, in summarizing Dinucci,  points out the suspicious nature of many European citizens being in locked down in their homes, while elite NATO troops are able to travel around without any restrictions at all. Popalloff, concludes his/her article by saying that the “pandemic is obviously a cover story for some kind of powerplay by the 1%.”
&gt;
&gt;The implication here is that the Coronavirus pandemic, the European lockdowns, and the NATO exercise all combine into a nefarious coup being covertly orchestrated by the 1% (the Deep State), and people need to be concerned about what is really happening behind the scenes.

&gt;Is Coronavirus a Deep State Bioweapon attack on China planned in 2005?

-

&gt; In an interview and letter made available in 2010, an anonymous official within the City of London revealed a secret plan supported by high-level Masons to support a biological warfare attack against China designed to cripple its economic growth and growing military power. The biological weapon was to be part of a timeline of both contrived geopolitical events and a natural disaster that would eliminate half of the planet’s population.

-

&gt;…a contrived limited nuclear war in the Middle East planned to occur sometime before 2012 that involved the direct participation of China and the US after Israel launched a preemptive attack against Iran:

-

&gt; The Vatican has long been rumored to be working closely with extraterrestrial visitors, as I have explained in another article. The whistleblower learned that extraterrestrials are much involved in the high-level planning of geopolitical events as he highlighted in his summary of the planned timeline discussed at the 2005 meeting…

It is fine if countries want to change this, it is also fine if countries do not want to be a part of it. The Netherlands should not be a part of it in my opinion, it is not the union we signed up for and it ties countries together too much. 

The ESM already goes too far in my view.

The EU as it stands is mutually beneficial for all already, so I think the threats of some members to leave are overblown. I'm perceiving a bluff and am willing to call it. I might be wrong, a risk I'm willing to take. Nothing against Italy or Spain by the way, but their public finances are and should be their own business.

With people flared as Dutch (I won't call them Dutch because I have no way of knowing if they actually are) calling this cover ""provocative"", instead of racist or xenophobic or whatever you prefer, and criticizing the guy who posted this instead of the one who actually made it?

It's not just a magazine, I have tens of screenshots of people from this /r being racist and insulting (pretty safe to assume they are not all old, ignorant geezer from bumfuck nowhere, since they are educated enough to be able to write in a foreign language and on a relatively little known social media like Reddit).

Just the fact that this cover exists proves that there's a target for this type of rhetoric. 

Is everyone from the Netherlands (or even the majority) like this? Obviously not, I happen to live in one of the few palaces in Italy where Dutch emigrate to, one of them even married my aunt and had two children with her, almost all of them are perfectly lovely people. But this does not mean there isn't an unresolved racial issue in your society that no amount of sticking your heads under the sand will solve.

&gt; Dutch people in general love Spain and Italy. Just spin it as: we are helping our friends. Hoekstra just said on live TV he was contemplating to go on holiday in Spain or Italy.

Right, they ""love"" Italy and Spain because they spend their vacations here. I bet people that go to Sharm el-Sheikh all ""love"" Egypt./s The south of Europe isn't a fucking theme park.

Love implies a modicum of respect and trust, where I'm from. Don't kid yourself, you just like the scenery or the food or God knows what, you don't ""love"" the country. Much less its people. And, frankly, no one expects you to do it, even loving one's country is hard, sometimes.

4293,"&gt; It’s the easiest way to understand contribution bit not the fairest because non monetary contribution isn’t so easy to account for. Again the size of the EU market is one of its main strengths and it surely isn’t provides by the frugal fours but it isn’t accounted for in the evaluation.

It is fair. We pay more per capita for access to the sizable EU market and to be a part of it. Demanding more because Italy sucked at decreasing its debt is what's unfair.

&gt;For example Austria has virtually no military expenses and is not part of NATO.

That's because they're neutral (though EU membership and neutrality is a disputed topic) and don't have agressive neighbouring countries. They're also indirectly protected by NATO due to the NATO troops deployed across Eastern European NATO member states, despite not being a member itself (Russia's not going to steamroll through NATO countries to get to Austria).

&gt;I say that the F4 shouldn’t complain because you might be net contributors in cash as are Italy and France but your real contribution in the other sectors is much lower.

What other sectors? The Netherlands is responsible for the distribution of a huge amount of goods throughout Europe. Do you think Rotterdam became Europe's busiest cargo port overnight? Or that Schiphol is Europe's 4th busiest airport by sheer coincidence?

Of course not. The infrastructure required to keep that going isn't cheap, and Germany's industry is reliant on it (as are other European sectors).

That, and we're responsible for a huge amount of technology (though that's not limited to just Europe) through ASML holding.

&gt;Italy has no problem borrowing money for now but I honestly can’t see why we wouldn’t borrow all together at a lower interest rate.

Because it'd fuck over the low interest rate my government managed to get by screwing people like me over.

&gt;EDIT: I forgot about NATO and the EU, the latter does have military projects in the world which mainly use French Italian or German military and border control is not part of nato duties, furthermore we have seen how nato has been divided in the last years

The EU does have limited military programmes, but NATO is by and large the biggest contributor to our safety. As for border control; Italy and France aren't paying for border control at the port of Rotterdam or Schiphol Amsterdam airport so I don't completely get where you're going with that.

As for NATO's division; that's due to the US' retardism. The EU is just as divided, if not more, when it comes to military matters. Or anything really (just look at this discussion).

2. The writer is the head of the ""Polish Economic Institute"". A organization that is partially funded by the EU, you can't really use that as a proper source ffs...

4. I don't need to read another book about the EU, I'm reasonably well educated and well read in this matter, thank you. I prefer the EU the way it was intended, not the behemoth it has become.

Have you read your own article? I don't have the time to respond to every sentence, but for an example about the low quality: 

In reaction to a statement of Mark Rutte that we are a net contributor, the author states that without immigrant labor we wouldn't be a net contributor... Like wtf has that to do with the subject of being a net contributor? Yes value was added by those immigrants and we paid them for it in salary. Why should that value not be counted towards our economy?

Or that we are not a net contributor, because; ""*Everybody in the single market with the help of the cohesion policy is a ""net receiver""* "" Well that solves it then, everybody in the EU is a net receiver now, nobody is a net contributor anymore.

France would benefit in the same way as Italy and Spain if debt would be shared across the EU, by having to pay less interest on their bonds while being able to continue running up that debt.

4544,"I made these flags a while back. Not sure why they have been posted all over reddit today. 

Here are the explanations for all of them,

For all of the flags I decided to use the dimensions and colours used on the national flags of the countries. Along with some black of course.

For Denmark I decided to replace the Nordic cross on the Danish flag with a white 16-pointed star. The star is drawn in the same fashion that Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe drew the supernova of 1572 in his works De Nova Stella.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tycho_Brahe#/media/File:Tycho_Cas_SN1572.jpg

Finland's space flag depicts the constellation of Leo. The lion, which is Finland's national symbol is depicted on it's coat of arms surrounded by nine white roses, here replaced by the nine primary stars of the constellation of Leo.

For Iceland I drew an aurora borealis effect in the colours of the Icelandic flag. Possibly the best looking flag of the bunch.

Norway received the colours from their Nordic cross in a wedge shape rising against a black sky. The wedge is similar the Norwegian air force roundel.

The Swedish flag is a blue planet rising. The inspiration was the photo Earthrise which was taken using a Swedish Hasselblad camera. Orbiting the planet is a yellow spacecraft shaped like a crown.

4570,"Believe it or not, if you ask Romanians who were the most reasonable occupiers between the Russian Empire, the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the Ottoman Empire, most Romanians will choose the Ottomans. Even thou they were the most distant to us culturally and religiously, but they also got involved the least in our shit and didn't care much about ""suppressing"" us since the Romanian economy based on resources and agriculture didn't compete much with the Ottoman one based on commerce, actually they even complemented each other somewhat. (unlike Russia for example were the economies were direct competitors)

Now most Romanians will still agree the Austro-Hungarians were the most developed and have the highest standards of living during more recent times (when the Ottoman golden period fell apart), and they still were much better than the Russians (which were ironically the only ones of the same faith as the Romanians, we all know how important ones faith was back then). The Austrian's main problem was that they didn't like viewing the Romanians much as first class or at least ""normal"" citizens in their multi-ethnic empire.

History is sometimes ironic like that. And if you think that was because Romanians and Russians didn't have enough things in common, you're actually surprisingly wrong. Although our ties were mostly with the Ruthenians and current relations with Ukraine might not show it, mainly through the Principality of Moldova Romania had a great amount of contact with the Kievan Princes. Be it fighting invading hordes, kicking out the Mongols or even Cossacks (yes I know ,the most Ukrainian/Russian thing ever), believe it or not there was a very large amount of Romanian Cossacks, and if you search for it on Wikipedia you will find a rather shockingly large list of Romanian Cossack leaders, many of the highest positions like Hatmans (which by the way used to mean general in Romania in the past but now no one uses it, it was completely replace by Capitan). I think  at some point some Moldovial rulers were even rulers of parts of Ruthenia or something (royal marriages and what not).

4583,"&gt; I'm living in Stockholm and honestly, people didn't give a crap about masks

I'm living in Gothenburg and that's because the information was that masks don't do shit if you don't have it, and to use them when they should be given to healthcare professionals and the high risk who actually need to was the dumb thing to do. For regular people it was to wash your hands, cough or sneeze into your elbow and if you want to wear gloves. People buying up masks when they didn't need it were selfish as fuck.

&gt; preferring to sacrifice a part of the population (the old and the immigrants)

This is such a bad take that it is borderline offensive. Why is not going into lockdown seen as a means to sacrifice immigrants when we can follow all the same guidelines as anyone else? Same goes for old people, if they are high risk and still go outside without taking the necessary precautions then that isn't the lack of lockdowns fault. 

The general opinion seems to be ""if you didn't stop everyone from going outside and lockdown the entire country then you want to kill old people"" which is so asinine that it's almost funny. People will only be happy to stay in lockdown for so long, and you can't force them back into lockdown soon after letting them back out again without risking a lot of backlash. We've still got 12-18 months AT LEAST to go without a vaccine with this virus floating around and I would put every last coin I have on countries that had massive lockdowns suffering from huge second waves and a population that refuses to go back into lockdown.

4595,"&gt; That's very naive view of human nature. Lack of conscience isn't the  sole cause of wars and murders. 

Man, you throw the word ""naive"" around like it's hot candy, do you even know what it means or do you just love to use catch words you found on the internet?

&gt;There have been plenty of religious and  ideological wars throughout history. 

mate, there are countless ""reasons"" for wars. ideology, religion, skin color, language, the list goes on. 

And now take an educated guess why humans can kill themselves over such rather small details when it comes to humankind as a whole. 

In the end, it is all about power. And the willingness of a lot of humans to kill for that. Dehumanizing is at the forefront of this trend, where empathy is conciously removed from the equation. And now take a guess what kind of people do that. 

&gt; Beliefs and ideas matter. WWII didn't happen because Germans lack  conscience or because there was a sudden inexplicable surge of  sociopaths in the population. It happened because critical number of  ordinary and otherwise good psychologically normal people bought  disastrously bad ideas. It's evidenced by the fact that Nazi propaganda  abused empathy to push its cause. 

No, ideas do ""not"" matter when it comes to the shittyness of human nature. That is why people growing up in a certain society/religion will usually consider this soceity/religion the ""best"", despite often having no idea what other societes or religions even look like.Just take a look at all these religious war, or do you really want to tell me that teaching details about religion is a propper reason to go to war? It is not. People just use such reasons as excuse for their own ambitions.

People are tribal and rather primitive in their nature, with civilisation only having a very weak sway over people. Remove the threat of psunishment for any given crime and lots of people ""will"" become monsters. Something observable all over history and hardly a new phenomenon with the Nazis. What was different with the Nazis was that they had modern industry at their disposal to do what they did. 

Believing in proportional disastrous ideas in itself does not make people into murderers. It happens because people are so often capable to become murderers that even ""ideas"" often make them want to kill others. 

&gt; Honestly, I find this carefree attitude, to uncritically accepting and  acting on ideas without taking time to consider whether they are  compatible with basic ethical commitments, alarming. There very few  people in this world who would consciously do evil. Most of them are  simply ignorant or neglectful or entangled in their own lies, excuses,  or convoluted systems of thought, which make them blind to the  consequences of their own actions. 

And I rather consider exactly this attitude to incredibly ""naive"", to use this word that you love so much. 

Simply because it makes it so much easier for another ideology to take its place. just remove the Swastika and have a reband of the ideology and there you go. If you do not take human nature into account and how easy it is to dehumanize an enemy and make your followers go al out of bonkers all you achieve is fighting the symptons, never the root cause.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/grnsq3/78_years_ago_two_czechoslovak_paratroopers_jozef/fs3g65k/,Gammelpreiss,1590678480

The CCP has had many conflicts with neighbours and conflicts on foreign territory, like with the KMT in Myanmar territory. Some of the countries invaded and occupied include:

Tibet, Korea, Taiwan (post civil war, mostly naval), Myanmar (to fight PRC, similar to US in Afghanistan to fight Taliban), Tibetan uprising, multiple invasions of India, Vietnam (Chinese troops with North Vietnam against the democratic government of South Vietnam), border conflicts with the USSR, Communist Vietnam after the Vietnam war including occupations of parts of Vietnam.

Probably missed a few, but the PRC has an extensive history of invading other states given how young the PRC is.

Currently though the threats from the CCP are more ""Cold War"" style threats of: sowing division in the EU, supporting illegitimate dictatorships like Venezuela after Maduro lost the elections, unfair economic competition to cripple foreign industries, toleration of criminal groups as long as they operate abroad including toleration of exports of drugs like Fentanyl as a trade which they learnt from the British but are more discreet about and try not to let it be sold in China, intellectual property theft, theft of private data of foreign citizens, cyber-attacks on foreign states private businesses and people outside of CCP control.

Pretty much any way they can harm democratic nations they have been carrying out for decades. CCP occupations are worse than puppet governments and ""spreading democracy"".

Our government exists to stand in the way of any sort of prosperity for the masses and to support the dozens of families who rule us and the police are their lapdogs who beat us when we raise our heads. Fuck Greece, there is nothing to be proud of in this country and I am extremely ashamed to have been spawned by this degenerated husk of a people. At every turn of my life, there was Greece and my fellow Greeks, a cruel, capricious and sneaky lot, ready and only too gleeful to take away my smile and ruin my life in any way they can with some inane corrupt bullshit or pointless bureaucratic expensive red tape I couldn't afford.

Why not? They took part in colonialism, too. Large parts of the East African coast was controlled by Arabs for centuries before Europeans kicked them out. How do you think Islam make it to places as far South as Mozambique? 

&gt;You have examples of Jannissaries and Mamluks who lead entire nations, and they were slaves raised in the Muslim world. European chattel Slavery was ten times worse than this type of Slavery. And the abolition of Slavery in Africa started with Europeans against other Europeans who you know by that time hold all monopolies on slave trade, yeah really brave.

Jannissars and Mamluks were generally not from African origin, as far as I know. Most of them were European,  Caucasian and Turks.

Male African slaves were castrated before they were send to Arabia. About half of them died in this procedure. I wouldn't call this ""better"" tbh. And it's one reason why there aren't millions of Afro-Saudis out there. They couldn't reproduce, which ensured to flow of more castrated slaves.

Actually, from a geneva convention point of view it's the entire opposite.

Killing a high rank officer can make an actual difference to the enemies occupational strength.

Not only do you take out an important cog of the machine, you also show that your enemy leadership is vulnerable. Besides giving a boost to your morale it can decrease the morale of the enemy considerably.

How are our politicians supposed to explain that to a voterbase that has seen extensive privatization, tax increases, social welfare cuts and recently the migration crisis? If this is badly handled, EU scepticism will rise across 90% of the political spectrum in Sweden.

- If the only thing that happens is a money transfer, won't the structural issue still be a problem? Does this proposal solve the issues you describe, or is it ""just"" a way to keep the union together?

Yes, we Turks are sensitive when it comes to the topic of the Armenian Genocide, but that is usually because people who preech for its recognition do not speak for it for the prosperity and unity of the Turkish and Armenian people. Rather, to bash on Turks.

4851,"&gt;It makes no sense. Yes the people want the EU to cooperate on things that matter, but the reality is that the EU doesn't, and won't, and is neither interested nor capable of doing so.

Effectively there is a disconnect between what people would like in terms of cooperation (which does vary by member state..) and both what there is consensus for, and indeed what would require more integration.

It is true to say that there are areas where EU members would find value in further pooling sovereignty (as they do in a slew of areas..) to support further cooperation, the problem tends to be how that is implemented (once you take into account a slew of objections and issues..) and that it falls short of what some people would like. The result is people demanding that the EU does more, while not wanting more integration on one side, and people demanding that the EU does more and demanding integration unnecessary to achieve that on the other..

Basically there needs to be a large, EU wide discussion about what the EU should be, some work to build consensus around that, then an implementation (before it starts again..). Obviously that would mean actual public input and potentially an undermining of member states powers, or an erosion in what the EU is, so instead we end up with this messy approach instead, where there is almost a push to make things less transparent and to jump as far forward as possible in the hope that the things that are jumped over will have to be dealt with to prevent failures later.. ￼",United Kingdom - Personally vouched for by /u/colourfox,/r/europe/comments/grncp4/germanys_scholz_sees_recovery_fund_as_more_than/fs2tfav/,-ah,1590664655

It's extremely unlikely that Italy or Spain would default on their debts. If they will it will affect the whole EU area and lots of Europeans would have their pension saving affected.

This package is helping by providing debts at a much better interest rate; debts that are more likely to be paid than at a higher interest rate.

4901,"&gt;And what is the ideological outcome.

There are lots of ways that member states, or indeed the EU can push money into the economy via the existing mechanisms. The problem is that it's hard and creates political problems between contributing members. The aim here is for the EU to borrow and grant funds to member states, that significantly changes the role of the EU in borrowing and creates a path for significant 'federal' debt as a core component of the EU budget.  Right now the EU can not borrow to fund its own operations, it can't borrow to fund grand programmes, or development aid, or EU level interventions.. This cuts through that.

There has been a long standing aim to change that, we saw it in 2008 and we've seen it in the interim in a number of guises, it has generally had a number of detractors.

The ideological outcome is a significant shift in what the EU can do in terms of borrowing, without the scrutiny that a treaty change would come with. It's effectively more powers being passed to the EU by member states by virtue of reinterpretation or a lack of resistance rather than doing it formally and having to be accountable.

&gt;EU rules dictate that the ECB cant provide funding directly to euro countries. So of course if eu countries want access to ecb funds then there has to be a political work around to come up with a legal framework. Which is this exactly. There is no predetermined outcome.

4907,"&gt;The point that you can see where Kiev/Belarus is in that video

And you can clearly see on the video that Kiev indeed belonged for ~100 years to the PLC (the internal Polish-Lithuanian border is not shown in your video unfortunately, but it was on the Polish side of it). And the part of Belarus shown on this map did belong to Poland in the interwar period in 20th century.

&gt;How's that even true, when Lithuanian King is in Warsaw

Wait until you find out that in that historical period there was a French king in Hungary, and Luxemburgian king in Czechia/Bohemia. Yes, dynastic intermarriages and ensuing medieval politics was very interesting.

&gt;and same as it's shown in this video

But this video literally shows the same thing this map does? For writing such long walls of text, you surely have some serious difficulties explaining what exactly your point is.

&gt;Now Poles knowing what treat this posses, because apparently you had ""issues"" with your ruler, he couldn't have heirs and no one could replace him easily because reasons

When he died, his cousin from a French-Hungarian dynasty took over. Problem over.

\&gt;Lithuanian education

Later on, we simply had a female king, and she needed a husband, ideally one that would expand the Polish power projection abroad. Various candidates were considered, among those heirs ftom the Austrian ruling family, but ultimately a Lithuanian ruler was chosen on the condition that him, and the entire country will be converted to Catholicism.

The Polish female ruler died in childbirth 14 years later, and Polish nobles, after long negotiations, and granting some serious privilleges to the nobility, they decided to proclaim her 14-year long husband a king, as by then he was a well accustomed withe the country, and well-suited to carry on ruling. He then married again, and again, lived to the old age, and his children were brought up in the Polish court and with Polish customs and culture, and continued the Jagiellonian dynasty which lasted for another 150 years.

&gt;So that's how what was once Great Dutchy, which would swallow Poland without chewing

Lolol, even at the greatest extent of the Grand Duchy in mid 14th crntury, Poland still had a higher population, stronger economy and was more developed than GDL, despite being smaller on map at the time.

And if it decided to openly enter into conflict with Poland for some incomprehensible reason, Poland would just temporarily ally with GDL's enemy Teutonic Knights, easily defeating GDL with combined forces.

&gt;Moscalls chip away whole Dutchy and poles couldn't give two shits, it was never belonging to them, so chip away, fuck Dutchy and LT in general.

Yeah, that's one of the aspect why union with GDL was a mistake - it involved us in a conflict with Muscovy we had no business being in, which ultimately led to our demise 400 years later.

&gt;Polands attitude is only worse towards Lithuania, to a point were you invade Lithuania and start polonization, which is treating lithuanians as if their lower beings and need to serve polish people. 

By the time the ""invasion"" in 1919 happened, those territories were already majority Polish, as the German census from 1916 shows. And the claim that it happened due to ""Polonisation"" is especially funny considering that this area was controlled by Russian Empire for 100 years prior to that, and Russian Empire put heavy although unsuccesfull effort to destroy the Polish culture and language, banning most Polish-language stuff within their country - yet they would also allow for ""Polonization"" of former GDL area to happen at the same time?

&gt;Poland is ""making"" demands for all the things I've mentioned in other comments

Poland is only demanding that Lithuania finally joins other civilized European countries in treating autochtonous national minorities who have local majorities in many towns and villages, like a civilized European country should.

'' In the [2005 OECD report for Greece](https://books.google.com/books?id=Wstn-8rGQZQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=el&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false) (p. 47) it was clearly stated that ""the impact of new accounting rules on the fiscal figures for the years 1997 to 1999 ranged from 0.7 to 1 percentage point of GDP; this retroactive change of methodology was responsible for the revised deficit exceeding 3% in 1999, the year of EMU membership qualification"". The above has led the Greek minister of finance to clarify that the 1999 budget deficit was below the prescribed 3% limit when it was calculated with the ESA79 methodology in force at the time of Greece's application. Since the remaining criteria had also been met, was [properly](http://www.hri.org/news/greek/ana/2004/04-12-08.ana.html#09) accepted into the Eurozone. ESA79 was also the methodology employed to calculate the deficits of all other Eurozone members at the time of their applications. ''

'' An error frequently made in press reports is the confusion of the discussion regarding Greece's Eurozone entry with the controversy regarding usage of derivatives’ deals with US banks by Greece and other Eurozone countries to hide their reported budget deficits. A [currency swap](http://georgewashington2.blogspot.com/2011/07/goldman-bet-against-its-european.html) arranged with [Goldman Sachs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs) allowed Greece to 'hide' 2.8 billion euros of debt, but that affected deficit values after 2001 (when Greece had already been admitted into the Eurozone) and is not related to Greece's Eurozone entry.

Especially when actions can't be reversed.

What did the local population get? Expertise in sugar cane planting? That becomes useless when they can barely plant it anymore. The sugar cane processing infrastructure? Also useless now. And you can barely go back to plating whatever you were doing before too. Infrastructure result is negative: you had productive land before, you don't anymore. You had expertise how to plant other things before, now you don't anymore.

Also, the time scale: If you mine, say silver, something until the resources run out in the local, what is the use of the knowledge of 'extracting silver' now? What use is the road from that mountain going to a port if none of them have any resources now? And in the end, the overseer was some spanish lord that just went back to spain and the population is left to fend off for themselves. And their old roads and farms, which were useful before the colonial silver mining, are now broken and unproductive (and a lot of expertise how to use those is lost). Infrastructure result is negative: you had productive farms and a well maintained road network linking cities before (instead of an empty mine to a useless port), you don't anymore. 

Colonization was not a process of 20-30 years where you come, build some mines railroads then go away. In some places they stayed until the resources were completely depleted. And the infrastructure and built and expertise was useless for the future, because the resource is not there anymore now.

&gt; But that process should still result in a functional resource extraction network that the local population can at least export for their own profit as opposed to colonial profits

This is impossible in some cases until you kick out the colonizer. If you manage to do it, of course. Maybe you can try again in 200-300 years. You said it yourself why it is impossible:

None of those things you've listed were brought here with the German and Austrian partitions (the abolition of serfdom was a big plus, though. Didn't happen in the Russian partition until the January Uprising forced their hand, though). The ""introduction of European languages"" is particularly funny, both for the obvious reason, and because Poles at the time were stereotyped as being very talented with those. 

As for the weird arguments being presented in TVPropaganda, I think part of it is just your regular old racism (muh superior European culture!! Unless it's treating queer people with dignity, then it's filthy western decadence), and another part is just lack of, lets call it, personal experience. Poland never had oversea colonies, and as such never had to come to terms with a history of colonialism. The closest we got was serfdom in Ukraine and Belarus. Except that serfdom was present in the entire PLC, and the vast majority of Poles were serfs too, so it gets treated in our culture less as ""enslaving other nations"" and more as ""that's just how things worked back then"". While that doesn't excuse the aforementioned racism, and I think a more explicit ""colonialism is bad"" message would be good, neither do I believe that we must be just as sensitive as Western Europeans and Americans to something that has little to do with our own history, just because it was a major issue in the west.",Poland,/r/europe/comments/grvhuy/polish_state_tv_elearning_lesson_on_colonialism/fs2ds8a/,HadACookie,1590650131

5096,"Most European capitals and large cities are surrounded by a ring of motorways in order to meet the high demand for road transport originating from these metropolitan areas. As a result, dense motorway networks can be found around capitals such as Budapest (120 km per 1000 km2), Vienna (109 km per 1000 km2), Madrid (96 km per 1000 km2), Prague and Berlin (both 91 km per 1000 km2). Since the motorways are generally concentrated in a ring close to the cities, the motorway density often decreases with the size of the area. For example, the motorway density reported for relatively small region of Wien is higher than for the much larger region of Île-de-France, even though the motorway network of Paris is larger per se.

Other densely populated regions with high motorway density include the Randstad region in the western part of the Netherlands: Zuid-Holland (127 km per 1000 km2), Utrecht (125 km per 1000 km2) and Noord-Holland (108 km per 1000 km2).

High motorway densities are also found around the major seaports of northern Europe: the motorway densities of the regions of Bremen (205 km per 1000 km2) with the port of Bremerhaven, of Zuid-Holland with the port of Rotterdam (127 km per 1000 km2) and of Hamburg (114 km per 1000 km2) are among the highest of all European regions.

Another reason for the high density of the motorway network in some central European countries (such as Germany) is the proportionately high volume of transit freight traffic.

The density of motorways on islands is generally low, as islands cannot be reached directly by road. Instead, they rely on sea or air transport. Even so, the motorway density of the Canary Islands appears relatively high at 37 km per 1000 km².

The primary reason for Géza II's invitation of Germans **was border defense**, similar to employing the Székelys against invaders (The Szekelys were used to act as a barrier against the Tatar invasions from up North, hence their high concentration in the 2, 3 counties on the map - some still commemorate annually the 1717 Tatar invasion today by fasting, in [the Cluj village, Sic](https://www.mediafax.ro/social/cluj-satenii-din-sic-tin-post-si-merg-la-biserica-pentru-a-comemora-invazia-tatara-din-1717-foto-15605889)).

Germans were also sought for their mining expertise and ability to develop the region's economy, since they were skilled traders and crafty in varied trades.

They were drawn there **by the elite status they'd have** in the new territories, alongside Hungarians and the Szekelys. They were all members of of the *Unio Trium Nationum* (or 'Union of the Three Nations'), which was a charter signed in 1438.

&gt; 
&gt; Public opinion surveys

&gt; A crucial, differentiating aspect of our measure is that, in addition to experts’ assessments, we use,
&gt; where available, public-opinion surveys—mainly the World Values Survey. Indicators based on the
&gt; surveys predominate heavily in the political participation and political culture categories, and a few are
&gt; used in the civil liberties and functioning of government categories.
&gt; In addition to the World Values Survey, other sources that can be leveraged include the
&gt; Eurobarometer surveys, Gallup polls, Asian Barometer, Latin American Barometer, Afrobarometer and
&gt; national surveys. In the case of countries for which survey results are missing, survey results for similar
&gt; countries and expert assessment are used to fill in gaps.

So they use:

- experts' assessments
- public opinion surveys
- survey results for other 'similar countries' where survey results for a specific country are missing

This basically means that results can vary from accurate for some countries to completely inaccurate for others. 

Expert opinion is valuable, as long as those experts truly know the political climate and the democratic framework. 

Public opinion is generally a terrible indicator. People tend to exaggerate corruption or lack of it, tend to have poor knowledge of the legislative component of their democracy and can be ill-informed regarding elections and fraud.

And using survey results for similar countries when data is missing is just plain wrong. Just go with N/A if you don't have data, don't substitute your own. 

A better alternative would be to:

1. Analyze and compare democratic frameworks on a country-by-country basis. Rank them based on how democratic each system is. 
2. Obtain data regarding to what degree these are respected on a country-by-country basis. Having a great democratic framework is only good if it's respected and there's no voter fraud, election fraud etc.
3. Combine the data and get a score based on that.",Bromania,/r/europe/comments/grprx2/european_democracy_index_by_countries/fs27j3a/,outslide,1590644934

5181,"""The progesterone receptor is an example of how favourable genetic variants that were introduced into modern humans by mixing with Neandertals can have effects in people living today,"" says Hugo Zeberg, researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology and the Karolinska Institutet, who performed the study with colleagues Janet Kelso and Svante Pääbo.

Progesterone is a hormone, which plays an important role in the menstrual cycle and in pregnancy. Analyses of biobank data from more than 450,000 participants – among them 244,000 women – show that almost one in three women in Europe have inherited the progesterone receptor from Neandertals. 29 percent carry one copy of the Neandertal receptor and three percent have two copies. ""The proportion of women who inherited this gene is about ten times greater than for most Neandertal gene variants,"" says Hugo Zeberg. ""These findings suggest that the Neandertal variant of the receptor has a favourable effect on fertility.""

The study shows that women who carry the Neandertal variant of the receptor tend to have fewer bleedings during early pregnancy, fewer miscarriages, and give birth to more children. Molecular analyses revealed that these women produce more progesterone receptors in their cells, which may lead to increased sensitivity to progesterone and protection against early miscarriages and bleeding",,/r/europe/comments/gs0mpg/women_with_neandertal_gene_give_birth_to_more/fs28nj9/,arnaoutelhs,1590645814

5196,"Well, that's the question, did Russia supply the BUK, or did the rebels repair a BUK they captured from Ukraine, as they claimed before the shootdown. Considering there is a bit of evidence showing it being transported towards Russia after the shootdown, you would expect there to be at least some evidence of it being brought in, and there is none. Also we had photos of the Ukrainian captured BUKs before the shootdown, and claims that the rebels repaired at least 1 of them to working conditions, so it is within reason to consider this possibility too. Balance of the evidence suggests that this is indeed what happened. Of course, it could be that it was just never photoed coming in, it's not impossible.

The other thing is, of course, who actually pulled the trigger. Ever since the shootdown I was absolutely sure that it was the rebels, but since I watched Strelkov's interview from last week, he is adamant that ""rebels did not shoot down the plane, no other comments"", which to me, suggests that it may have actually been someone who came in from Russia, current military or not, who came in to operate the BUK. I don't believe Ukraine could have shot it down, so it is either the rebels or someone from Russia, likely serving military member. And I tend to consider Strelkov to be an honest person, if he said that the rebels did not shoot it down, he probably knows they didn't, otherwise he would have just said ""no comment"" and left it at that. But he specifically added that ""the rebels did not shoot it down"". What a mindfuck.

Also, there is the question of Ukraine's involvement. We know that the plane was significantly diverted from its normal course by Ukrainian air traffic control. Could this have been done with the intent to cause the shootdown? There has been some suggestion of a second plane, possibly Ukrainian military, being near the Boeing around the time of a shootdown. If this was the case, it could have been used to attract being targeted and then manoeuvred away to cause the rocket to re-target to the Boeing instead. Israel did something similar in Syria, when their jet hid near a Russian recon plane and caused the rocket fired at it to re-target the Russian plane instead. Whether there was even a second plane though, is unknown, there is too little evidence. It seems likely that without someone's testimony, who was involved in the planning, it would be impossible to prove Ukraine's involvement, but the re-routing of the plane is sure highly suspicious.

In any case, we are unlikely to know the full truth any time soon, if ever. Only someone coming forward or declassification of additional information could paint the full picture.",Russia,/r/europe/comments/gqdase/russian_mh17_suspect_admits_moral_responsibility/fs1ukcn/,WeAreBRICS,1590635982

5201,"&gt; The act of someone flashing at the park is just that and that is classified as sexual harassment. Isn't so crazy, is it?

Just because it is, doesn't mean it should be. 

I have found these definitions for harassment:

&gt;illegal behaviour towards a person that causes mental or emotional suffering, which includes **repeated unwanted contacts** without a reasonable purpose, insults, threats, touching, or offensive language:

&gt;Harassment covers a wide range of behaviors of an offensive nature. It is commonly understood as **behavior that demeans, humiliates or embarrasses a person**, and it is characteristically identified by its unlikelihood in terms of social and moral reasonableness. In the legal sense, these are behaviors that appear to be disturbing, upsetting or threatening. They evolve from discriminatory grounds, and have an effect of nullifying or impairing a person from benefiting their rights. When these behaviors become repetitive, they are defined as bullying. **The continuity or repetitiveness and the aspect of distressing, alarming or threatening** may distinguish it from insult. 

So, a one time incident shouldn't count as harassment, because it's not repeated. And also, if someone exposes their genitalia to another person, I think more than humiliating the second person they would be humiliating themselves, but I digress.",⠀,/r/europe/comments/grf7l9/mens_world_the_sexual_harassment_video_that_shook/fs1v34q/,Tyler1492,1590636308

5425,"I have no idea what propaganda you've been reading, but [here](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/10/turkey-rejects-resolution-armenian-genocide-191030054815944.html) is Turkey's response to the U.S Congress' vote on recognizing the Armenian genocide, an _official_ response from the Ankara gov't.

""[The recognition] is devoid of any historical or legal basis"" 

Also, [here's](https://www.armenian-genocide.org/turkey.html) an in-depth report on how the Armenians, Kurds, and other minorities have been suppressed over the past century in Turkey's attempt to create a homologous ethnostate. 

[This](https://hnn.us/roundup/entries/125231.html) article provides a direct quote from the then-prime minister Tayyip Erdogan in 2010, responding to how he would handle the existing Armenians in Turkey.

""We tolerate 100,000 [Armenians]. So, what am I going to do tomorrow? If necessary I will tell the 100,000: OK, time to go back to your country. Why? They are not my citizens. I am not obliged to keep them in my country."" 

Not only is the 100,000 number generous (there are only an estimated 70,000 Armenians currently in Turkey) but it's also down from 2 million in 1914. Another of his quotes is that it was ""ugly"" to be an Armenian. Erdogan is currently the President of Turkey and the leader of the Islamist party there, may I remind you.  How is his attitude one of acceptance/recognition? 

[Here's](https://www.npr.org/2019/12/12/787582258/senate-passes-armenia-genocide-measure-ignoring-white-house-objections) an article by NPR that includes a quote from Turkey's communications director, stating ""History will note these resolutions as irresponsible and irrational. [U.S. lawmakers] will go down in history as the responsible party for causing a long lasting damage between the two nations.""



Lastly, [this](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-114jhrg95113/html/CHRG-114jhrg95113.htm) article is the transcript of a U.S Senate hearing in 2014 marking the 100th anniversary of the beginning of the genocide. One of the speakers noted this about a prior meeting arranged between the Turks and the Armenians

""We invited the Turks. We invited the Armenians. They sat at a table not unlike this one. And frankly, the denial--it was sophomoric, to say the least. And the arguments proffered by a distinguished member of the diplomatic corps for Turkey reminded me exactly of the Holocaust deniers.""

I get that scandinavians don't feel good about federalisation. But you guys have had your mini-EU for some time between the nordics, so I wonder if it's just that you feel culturally too distant from us or it's just cold economic calculation that makes you disapprove of federalisation.

They pardoned part of it and the rebuilding of a functioning economy was necessary to even pay back anything (btw.

The difference is that they only lend what they were absolutely certain to get back.

Here's a quote from wiki:
In the mid-14th century, upon the death of Bolesław Jerzy II of Mazovia, king Casimir III of Poland initiated campaigns (1340–1366) to take Galicia-Volhynia. Meanwhile, the heartland of Rus', including Kiev, became the territory of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, ruled by Gediminas and his successors, after the Battle on the Irpen' River. Following the 1386 Union of Krewo, a dynastic union between Poland and Lithuania, much of what became northern Ukraine was ruled by the increasingly Slavicised local Lithuanian nobles as part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. By 1392 the so-called Galicia–Volhynia Wars ended. Polish colonisers of depopulated lands in northern and central Ukraine founded or re-founded many towns. In 1430 Podolia was incorporated under the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland as Podolian Voivodeship. In 1441, in the southern Ukraine, especially Crimea and surrounding steppes, Genghisid prince Haci I Giray founded the Crimean Khanate.[47]


Bohdan Khmelnytsky, Hetman of Ukraine, established an independent Ukrainian Cossack state after the uprising in 1648 against Poland.
In 1569 the Union of Lublin established the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, and much Ukrainian territory was transferred from Lithuania to the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland, becoming Polish territory de jure

5496,"Greece is supposed to pay back the debt, in theory at least. So it can either have a growth larger than at least interest on debt or austerity for many decades.

As you write, they have aging population (ever-growing pensions) and no industrial base. There is no way they can grow out of this.

That leaves budget surplus for decades. I haven't researched it a lot, but I doubt we will find many examples where it happened in history. Recession once a decade and suddenly all your gains paying the debt for a decade evaporate.

I see very little difference between austerity to have surplus to pay back the debt and an austerity forced by losing access to credit markets. 

I have read that Argentina could borrow for 10%, 15 yrs after default. If you decide to pay back, it's decades before you borrow again.

Edit: Also consider an effect the current course had on the nation. They lost 400k people (2010 - 11.12 mil. people; 2019 - 10.72 mil. people). I am guessing young people, who were future of the nation. The ""debts must be payed and Euro is sacred"" cause a situation with the figures I already cited.

Very simple example: a person in country A (eg Germany) owns an asset in country B (for instance Microsoft stock from the USA) and receives 1000 usd in dividends per year from that investment. He then uses those 1000 usd to buy an American Iphone.

US will show a trade surplus of 1000 usd. Germany will show a 1000 usd trade deficit.

But Germany will not have to borrow dollars to compensate for that. And neither will the US. Government balance of budget doesn't come in the picture.

And you can find similar examples for new foreign investments.

Renewable electricity was also placed 1st in the merit order, so providers could generate whenever possible and utilities have to purchase the electricity. The difference between the market price and the guaranteed tariff is paid by all household consumers through an added charge on their electricity price (EEG-Umlage). 

The interesting dynamic is the following: If market prices drop, the difference between them and the guaranteed reimbursement for renewable generation increases. So the added charge the household customers have to pay increases, whereas the utilities tend to not reduce consumer prices, rather increasing their margins due to the low market prices. 

If nuclear power plants go offline, the market price will increase. This means that consumers will have to pay less of a surcharge, which is good for their bills or at least enough not to increase them in any significant manner.",-6 points 9 minutes ago,/r/europe/comments/grl4jf/spain_approves_push_for_100_renewable_bans_all/fs0d0kf/,Bojarow,1590607543

There's lots of historic records that prove this, as in actual orders signed by Stalin and other people (can't give any links because it may take hours to find anything, esp. in English), likely even Lenin. They didn't always kill people directly, but they tried their best to destroy their self identity by forcefully relocating them into Siberia, etc. (Ukrainians, Crimean Tatars, Chechens, etc.) with classic divide &amp; conquer (part of definition of ""ethnic cleansing"").

Yes, the goal set by Nazi Germany was horrible, but why USSR should be treated differently just because they did ethnic cleansing differently, if tenths of millions died in both cases?

Anyway, it all started with the monument... So if you admit that millions died a horrible death (sometimes people were simply shot, but other times raped, tortured, etc.), why is it so hard to understand that nations occupied by USSR have the right to do as they please with remnants of culture of their oppressors, esp. seeing as a legal successor of USSR, Russia, uses those entities as a mediums to continue oppressing said nations?",,/r/europe/comments/gr0574/for_georgias_independence_day_i_thought_i_would/frzxn1i/,8day,1590600171

The way you grossly generalise that running a surplus for a while in order to build up some reserves is somehow obsolete and debunked fiscal policy will strike a lot of people the wrong way.

Don't get me wrong I do think that expansionary fiscal policy is generally the way to go, but building some reserves at least has its merits.

5805,"The point everyone is trying to make (and that the US has made clear in two separate financial crisis) is that you didn't need to go through all of that austerity and penny pinching to grow and mantain a healthy and productive economy. You don't need constantly run surpluses after surpluses to achieve economic growth and social progress. The actual reason why the ""Frugal Four"" are so enamoured with fiscal responsibility ( hard to call it that to be honest, considering that's an implicit admission by your government that you're not worth investing into as a population) is that it allows northern government to mantain the most important relative advantage they believe the EU gives them: permanent monetary devaluation. Austerity means lower growth and lower wages: your wages and the wages of most of dutch workers are lower than they would be if they had been outside the euro. This is a net disadvantage for you, but a net advantage for the productive system, because essentially your exports are permanently devalued against your old currency. The opposite situation exists for Italy: the euro is permanently higher than the lira, making our exports more expensive than they would be without the common currency. If your government stopped running surpluses, it would make the economy grow more (by definition, since GDP factors in government budgets). This would put inflationary pressure on the euro, increasing salaries and appreciating the euro against other currencies. This makes every european export more expensive. The problem is that with your far higher labour costs, this would stop the permanent devaluation effect that the euro had on your exports, and while it would raise the costs of italian exports (or spanish exports) too, it would make them relatively more competitive than yours, because they'd still cost less. What I'm trying to say is that what your government calls fiscal responsibility is mostly their way of mantaining relative advantages in the EU, which is a system that needs relatively less developed areas to supply the more developed with free skilled workers and deflationary pressure. In other words, you need us (relatively) poorer than you. Because if we're not, the system falls apart, and you lose your relative advantages. It's a predatory system. It's also a predatory system that damages your labour too. You're paid less, you have less benefits, you retire later than you would, and they have thoroughly convinced you that there's literally no other way to develop, that you need to sacrifice to grow. Truth is, you didn't have to all that ""austerity"". Your suffering was for nothing, and you're defending a political system that sistematically wants to devalue you, and your labour, because it ticks all the right boxes when it comes to nationalism. It makes you feel like the laborious ant to the lazy cricket (was it a cricket?) and confirms all you've ever thought and have been taught about both yourself and Southerners, as this sub has amptly demonstrated time and time again these past few months. You see us as inferiors, and you allow yourself to be mistreated by your government without even understanding that you're being mistreated just because it will allow you to keep feeling like you're our better.

Does that mean:

1. We should all be reckless and profligates spenders? No
2. Italy has many structural problems that have nothing to do with Europe? Yes
3. The uneasiness to hand our political class almost 200 billion € is unfounded? No

But 1) also means that we shouldn't exalt surpluses as a moral imperative. Surpluses are to be used in periods of high growth to reduce debt. Any other application is just to drive down labour costs at the expense of the workers; and 2) also implies that while Italy structural problems are its own, the EU is a monetary cage that enshrines preexisting conditions and doesn't allow meaningful internal reforms without massive and at the end of the day actually counterproductive fiscal sacrifices. By removing monetary policy from the grasp of nations and by limiting actual economic policy from parliaments, you force national governments to sacrifice a hell of a lot more than they'd have to do otherwise to achieve meaningful change. In fact, these sacrifices would be so dire that they'd end up just enshrining relative positions of development even more between countries. In short, while the EU isn't the cause of Italy's woes, it does make resolving them essentially impossible to resolve, and this impossibility is actually valued by other countries, since the productive models pushed by their governments rely on being in a monetary union with underdeveloped areas. And 3), sure, the reservation is understandable, but let's not pretend there aren't racial/xenophobic elements to it. The idea that Italy could do good reforms with this money is simply never considered because it belies the idea that incompetency and corruption are innately italian qualities that could never be purged: the only way to ""resolve"" Italy is to let you rule it, or fix it, or overrule italian wills, as of course we all know that Italians are prone to daydreaming populism (but of course, when the dutch are inevitably pushed to populism by feckless, lazy, lounging about italian voters, they are fully justified).

5849,"A pro-life activist was accused of defamation during a show on Polsat News television by seven men. Kaja Godek wanted the case to be dropped because ""the victims did not show that they were gay"". The court granted her application and discontinued the proceedings.

Kaja Godek is a pro-life activist, who conducts social activities within the Life and Family Foundation, of which she is a volunteer and board member. The Foundation is famous for promoting homophonic content and anti-abortion activities. All over Poland, it sets up banners with slogans aimed at the LGBT+ community. Among other things, they show that homosexuality seriously harms life and health, and that non-heteronormative people are four times more likely to commit murder. 

A year ago, Godek stood as a candidate from the list of the KORWiN Confederation of Braun Liroy Nationalists in the European Parliament elections. On May 19, 2019, she was invited to the program Breakfast in Polsat News. 
Kaja Godek insults in Polsat 

 ""The fight against paedophilia in the Church and in every environment must be above all a limitation of the influence of homolobby and this is not done by any political force in Poland today, because it is paederasty that is the introduction to paedophilia and this is shown in the Sekielski brothers' film. There, out of six cases of harassment, five are homosexual. And it always is. Now gays say they want to adopt children. Why do they want to adopt children? Because they want to harass and rape them, those are the facts"" - the words of Godek have outraged many. 

But seven men have filed a private indictment against Godek in court under Article 212 of the Penal Code.  
Godek wanted to redeem 

Before the trial began and the indictment was read out, Kaja Godek and her lawyers filed a motion to discontinue the proceedings. - It is the responsibility of the accuser to prove that the words concerned them, and the honourable gentlemen did not carry out such proof. In our opinion, the deed, this statement, does not exhaust the elements of a forbidden act - said Kaja Godek after leaving the court. 

The journalists were not admitted to this session. Due to the restrictions connected with the coronavirus epidemic only the parties to the trial and witnesses can enter the building of the District Court for Warsaw-Praga-Północ. The entrance door is guarded by security guards and a policeman, everyone has to state the ""purpose of the visit"" and identify themselves.  

 - According to Mrs. Godek, accusers should prove that they are gay. The arguments presented by the defendant's attorneys were completely absurd - comments Konrad Dulkowski, President of the Monitoring Centre for Racist and Xenophobic Behaviour, who participated in the trial as a social party.  
""Unbelievable and scandalous"" court decision 

The District Court for Warsaw-Praga-Północ took up the application on Wednesday afternoon. Judge Małgorzata Nowik granted the motion of Godek's attorneys and discontinued the proceedings. Reason? No reason for directness. She decided that Godek did not know the persons she insulted.   

- Unbelievable and scandalous. This ruling shows that LGBT people have virtually no way to defend their dignity,"" comments Dulkowski. He points out that the court's decision is surprising, because Article 212 of the Penal Code refers to a group of people. - And there are rulings that indicate that someone who insults does not need to know the individual members of the group he insults - indicates the president of the Centre.   

Only three people listened to the announcement of the decision: Kaja Godek, the prosecutors' attorney Magdalena Spisak and Konrad Dulkowski, the president of OMZRiK. The media was not allowed in. - And yet, the judge was terribly nervous, until she was shaking. Very strange - Konrad Dulkowski reports.   
Godek: There is freedom of speech in Poland

A complaint against Wednesday's court decision will be submitted by both the prosecutors' attorney and the Monitoring Centre for Racism and Xenophobia. - We will fight to the end. If necessary, it will end with a complaint to the European Court of Human Rights - announced the President of the Centre.

And Kaja Godek will triumph: - The discontinuance of this case confirms that there is freedom of speech in Poland, especially when speaking in the public interest. 

Godek is known for her controversial views. She is a fierce activist of pro-life movements. He is one of the authors of the civic bill ""Stop Abortion"", which was dealt with by the Sejm in April. The project presented by Kaja Godek assumes a total ban on abortion procedures. - Abortion is worse than coronavirus. It brings more victims and they are all deadly - Godek spoke in the Sejm.

5938,"I don't know about KLM once again - but Air France does have an automated process to collect your voucher, although unlike Vueling (from what I understand from your comment), it requires manual action from the consumer.

I think that there's a few reasons for that:
- Creating a new PNR in the GDS used by AF/KLM is actually not free (I believe it costs them half a euro or something? but that adds up fast), so they prefer people to modify their existing reservation than collect a voucher and just book another flight later.
- Unlike low-cost airlines, the ones like Air France or KLM have stuff like personalized booking assistants for high-level frequent flyers, so they probably need flexibility and choice for every single one of these customers.
- They could have wanted a way for the customers to choose between voucher and cash, but it seems like this ship has sailed, as I don't recall being able to choose the latter option when I collected my voucher around a month ago.
- And of course, maybe they're hoping for customers to forget about their voucher and just not collect it. That would be a little bit scummy of course, but would probably save them quite a bit of money.",,/r/europe/comments/gr1oxx/air_franceklm_ceo_will_get_nearly_800000_euro/frz4wpg/,satouru,1590585421

I think it's a good proposal for the Netherlands. The net cost for the Netherlands is not that much, since we also get quite some money from the proposed fund.

5963,"in itlay, and probably in most of the empire territories, after the collapse of the roman empire most of the cities got depopulated, and people abandoned the houses which with time became wrecks. when cities became more attractive and they needed to grow the people ethier demolished what was still there to take materials or built on top of them as they could serve as foundations, or a bit of both, and this process almost never stopped, for example, it is said the in Rome they made more damages the Barberini than the barbars, because they demolished many roman buildings to take the precious materials to build new stuff. to put in perspective, the Colosseum is not like this due to it self collapsing, it is because popes and lords slowly mined it for its precious marbles to build other beatiful buildings; probably the other big example would be the Pantheon which had huge bronze beams as decoration in the entrance, thet got demolished by Urbano VII Barberini to make the San Peter's Baldachin.

tbf people and nobles where really upset with the pope due to this, but i doubt they could do anything

It's been very hard to quanitify the benefits of the EU. The Netherlands is however strategi ally importantly located and open borders are phenomenal for a trade dependant nations like the Netherlands. Saying its a net loss is therefore certainly true when looking from a short term and solely economic perspective. From a long term and social standpoint helping the hard hit nations might very well lead to net gains across the board. 

The problem of a vast social-economic chasm is still firmly there though. Covid-19 isn't the cause for the long oming financial crisis. Covid-19 is simply the tigger event that exposes the underlining problems in a number of countries. It's very hard to sell to the population is a number of countries that the 2008 financial crisis wasn't enough of a lesson for some countries to clean up their financial act. That is why the ""frugal four"" demand economical reforms in exchange for this relief fund. 

The problem is that without financial and economical reforms the next major crisis will again lead to bail-outs and emergency funds. At some point that becomes politically unsustainable. In fact, even this package will be a very hard sell and will require and immense amount of work load grease and consessions across the board. 

In the end I do feel we have a moral obligation to help other countries and it's okay if that costs us money.
