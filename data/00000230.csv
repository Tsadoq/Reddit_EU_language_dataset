Turkey is a West Asian country born out of the demise of the Ottoman Empire which itself was born out of an illegitimate claim to the Roman Empire. Constantinople was taken by force by the Ottomans and has since then been a launchpad for West Asians trying desperately to be considered as Europeans, which they never have and never will be.

If Turkey has a legitimate claim to be European, Britain equally has a claim to be South American due to its ownership and administration of the Falkland Islands.

But she was naive as she did not plan it accordingly and consider the burden debt ridden countries of the European south would face. She made an EU wide decision without talking about it with the EU and is facing the political consequences of that. Her poor management has allowed populism to emerge in Europe because the people mistook her act of kindness for refugees as abandonment of her countrymen. 

It would be unfortunate that her good intentions be overshadowed by her poor execution because I truly believe she could have brought refugees in and kept the EU together at the same time. It can be a template for great compassion and utter selflessness.

181,"The 1919 war with Poland was over Tesin and the main line between northern Moravia and eastern Slovakia. It was one the most important links in A-H as there were not other important railway connecting Slovakia with the western territories of the monarchy.  The exception was a line between Brno and Trencin, which opened in 1888. The reason for the under developed connections laid in 1873 market crash where many railway companies went bust. Several lines were under construction and never finished. The big one from Prussian Breslau via Opava-Vsetin-Trencin-Budapest was a casualty of the bust and bancruptcy. The Austrian government and former shareholders fought for years to get their money back causing such projects to be postponed and eventually abandoned.    

The Czechoslovak government opened several new lines in the 1920's between the Czech half and Slovakia like Lysa pass (Vsetin - Puchov), and Veseli and Myjava. The line between Brno-Breclav-Bratislava was totally rebuilt because the connection between Breclav-Kuty was only for a local cargo, not a passenger service. Several other lines were never finished and you can see some remainders in the countryside like Vizovice- Vsetin.

&gt; The Turkish public must acknowledge the injustices Greeks on Imbros island (Gökçeada) suffered in the 1960s, Greek Orthodox Patriarch Bartholomew said Nov. 12 at the launching of a book on the island’s Greek community.  
“Imbros could be a bridge between Turkey and Greece, but it was comprehended as a threat by Turkey. With this approach, the Rum \[Anatolian Greek\] minority, who were engaged in agriculture and raising livestock on the island, were forced to emigrate from there,” the patriarch said.Turkish society is not informed about the cruelty that occurred on the island at the time because of limited opportunities for communication, he said.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;**Jail built on island**  
According to Feryal Tansuğ, a historian at Istanbul’s Bahçeşehir University, who compiled the book “İmroz Rumları, Gökçeada Üzerine” (Rums of Imbros, on Gökçeada), non-Muslims on the island were targeted as part of an official policy that included allowing inmates at a jail built on the island to roam free and harass locals.  
“In 1960, there were nearly 6,000 Rums on the island, and the number is only 300 now,” Tansuğ told the Hürriyet Daily News yesterday.The book represents the first comprehensive academic study written in Turkish on the island’s Greek minority issue.Imbros, which was officially renamed Gökçeada in 1970 by Turkey, is located in the north Aegean Sea at the entrance of Saros Bay and is also a district of Çanakkale. A large majority of the island’s Greek population has left the island for various reasons since the beginning of the 1960s.   
“There is a lack academic study on such an important matter. When we talk about Rums of Turkey only Istanbul, Cappadocia and Pontic Rums are remembered, but Imbros is forgotten and it is a case that cannot be ignored,” Tansuğ said.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;**Pro-Hellenic name**  
Tansuğ said she titled the book “Imbros,” a pro-Hellenic name, because the appellation is 5,000 years old and is still used by locals, unlike “Gökçeada,” which was given by the Turkish government in 1970.The patriarch also expressed hope for the future. “Even if it has a different demography now, we will do our best for Imbros to \[make it\] an island where people live happily,” he said. k HDN

The Armenian Genocide happened in 1915, in Eastern Turkey. Ataturk was a mere officer in Gallipoli in Western Turkey most of that year. How the hell could he lead the Armenian Genocide if he wasn't even there and had no power to even do so if he wanted to?

It's the same thing for the Assyrian Genocide which ended in 1920 (started in 1914), so Ataturk had no kind of power where it started, and until it ended Ataturk wasn't in the region either.

Ataturk became president in 1923, and all 3 genocides you mentioned ended before that. And from 1919 to 1923 he was busy organizing the army that pushed back England, France, Greece, Italy and so on that had invaded the country and divided its regions for themselves.

Sandy areas replanted with sturdy growths to prevent soil erosion. The psalms sung in church produced in bunks by talented Danes schooled according to the teachings of Grundtvig https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N._F._S._Grundtvig Not just one national anthem produced but two (maybe three), To be Danish became a subject in school. Events were created to celebrate being Danish. The concept of the union state and the celebration of it became acceptable.

Here is where I disagree. Globalism doesn't in itself constitute an ideology. It's used as a slur for any number of beliefs.

For example, I believe in supranationalism, I like the EU, I support skilled immigration (at a high level) but I *don't* believe in granting religious minorities special rights *nor* in having open borders (i.e. uncontrolled immigration). I also think the nation state has a role to play on many issues, so despite advocating for more supranational politics I would not want to abolish nation states.

450,"&gt; You dint get slaughtered after 6 years because your milk production has stopped being efficient.  

No, but people get sacked from work if they don't produce anymore. And this is something that most workers realize at every moment in their life with no way of ever relaxing. The cow has no clue until one second before the bolt kills it instantly.  

&gt; You can also stop working, find another job, work less, move to another country, get in the dole. Whatever the you want, you are not an unwilling slave...  

Are you sure this isn't just very stressful to most people? To me it is, certainly. I do have many possibilities, but nothing is gotten for free, you need to work reall hard for it giving you serious stress symptoms (which I got already as a teenager, in fact, bleeding gum and nose, ear problems, hair loss etc.).  

&gt; Dairy farming is a big contributor to global warming  

Still tiny compared to burning fossile fuel. As far as I know Sweden will be fossile fuel free within 20 years or so, I'm sure we can emit a little cow gases then (and today) with not much problem.  

&gt; But the amount needed to produce the cows food is a lot. Its unsustainable even in sweden.  

No, we typically take water from the lakes and streams, not ground water. We'll notice if our lakes and streams start to get shallow. Until then it's a just a really bad argument.

454,"&gt; In any case, fracking has had way more environmental benefits than anything else because the increase in natural gas supply in the US is killing the coal industry. Natural gas burns clean compared to coal and pollutes exponentially less. 

So you consider the broad availability of Oil a good thing? Instead of being forced to finally switch to hybrids or electric you get 30 more years of gasoline. Actually thats a very bad thing.

&gt; Europe, and especially Germany, prefers to burn dirty coal and lignite compared to the US which is reducing coal in favor of clean shale gas from fracking. You can never look at something in isolation. 

Not really true. This is a short phase, while removing nuclear energy. Its very hard to provide a stable energy source while nuclear is gone. Not much other choices beside coal and gas for that period. We cannot do both at the same time without support of coal.

458,"&gt;Germany, too

So it turns out the US had similar lead regulations to the cleanest of EU states. Then the US must be way ahead of the EU as a whole. 

&gt;Where did i say the EU has stricter standards? It seems more like you are the one going into versus mode, whenever critiziced.

When you earlier said:

""The only things you need are making it worthwhile and you also need to exempt the industry from a lot environmental protection laws. With other words: you need a country ruled by lobbyists and not by the people""

 ""This article also makes pretty clear that there is no unbiased research in the US Government agencies. Basically all their results are at least influenced by the Government and therefore by lobbyists.""

or 

""We fear that the water we are still able to drink from our taps gets poisoned. I think it's a very good thing that we don't change our water protection laws just to get a cheaper oil price.""

You make it sound like you think the US is ruled by lobbyists which want to poison people's water to make money and that the government doesn't care. You were implying that the EU doesn't like fracking because you don't change your water protection laws just to get a cheaper oil price. 

My point is that the fact that the US does have strict environmental regulations shows that the US government is not ruled or controlled by lobbyists. The US government, in my experience, uses very good judgement and scientific analysis when making environmental decisions. How safe is something, how many jobs does it create, what is the risk reward?

If you compare the European Food Safety Authority or the EU commission to the American USDA or EPA, you will notice that EU's scientists almost always come up with the same conclusions as the US government scientists. The reason that European countries do things like ban fracking or GMOS is for political reasons. These are politicians making these kinds of decisions in Europe with political discretion. In the US, the government is required by law to be much more technocratic. The laws in the US require regulatory agencies to use science and they can't ban safe things just based on political discretion. 

Keep also in mind that fracking is not just ""to get cheaper oil prices"". It's about money and jobs. It employs millions of people and funnels tens of billions of dollars in tax revenue to state and local communities. And it's killing the coal industry in the US and making our air cleaner.

Another ""Switzerland is impossible"" argument.

Yes, the veto was as much a mistake now as it was in the PLC with the Golden Liberty. But that isnt a problem with culture, thats a problem with structure. Something people like you dont get as we slowly decend to the level of African tribalism loosing the virtues that allowes us to escape the Dark Ages. 

But a democratic, representative union is still possible. Clearly without Hungary, maybe without most of the current union, but we dont need another pre-WW1 geopolitical climate, so we better adapt.

They proped up dictators and warlords, they couped caribbean countries that didnt open their economies to american corporates, they spied on leaders and blackmailed anyone they didnt like. They dont hit us, as long as we jump before they even ask us to do so, and anyone who thinks they can play vasal to them and win will learn the hard way that they fold the first sign of danger, just like Vietnam learned, just like Korea with its 50 year stalemate did, just like Afghanistan currently dealing with the Taliban.

Fracking is when you drill vertically down, then horizontally outward and use pressure to make small breaks in the rock formations. I speak Spanish and the news article I read on it said that ""la extracción de gas en la plataforma Castor aumentan la alerta contra el uso de la fractura hidráulica o ""fracking"""". 

There was apparently an increase in fear over fracking once they saw the seismic activity from the conventional gas storage at Castor. But they weren't fracking in Castor off of Tarragona.

561,"&gt;However, I see no reason why the average citizen shouldn't be allowed to be a dual citizen.

Because dual citizens fundamentally do not have the same exposure to the consequences of political actions as natives without a second option (for *either* nationality involved).

The people in the car with seatbelts are gonna be less afraid of going so fast. Especially on something like radical economic reforms, e.g. introduction of a universal basic income, welfare, immigration or short term policy making.

This is compounded if there are major issues of split identity, like you get with Turks in Germany, who will support a radical ""back home"" but something else in Germany. They have a backup, native Turks don't. That's maybe an issue of who gets to vote but it could work similarly in German elections.

Or on identity you have Mexican Americans in the South/South West who maybe don't feel so American, especially if they're children of illegal migrants and are therefore American citizens by birth on soil. How will they vote in regards to Trump's border wall? Especially when the states they are in used to be Mexican territory?

Dual nationality is fine when people have properly harmonised sense of identity, the countries are very similar culturally or are tied together politically (e.g. dual EU country nationality) but it undoubtedly causes issues.

Personally I would not allow dual nationals to vote remotely if they leave the country (as with Turkey). I'd also be tempted to not allow them to vote in their new country either unless they relinquish their former passport.",Scotland,/r/europe/comments/8vhav2/increasingly_international_number_of_swiss_dual/e1o9599/,Hoobacious,1530559257

&gt; Homer, to be sure, does not portray Achilles and Patroclus as lovers (although some Classical Athenians thought he implied as much (Aeschylus fragments 135, 136 Radt; Plato Symposium 179e–180b; Aeschines Against Timarchus 133, 141–50) ), but he also did little to rule out such an interpretation.


___________________
Plato Symposium: 180a and 180b

&gt; avenged him, and sought death not merely in his behalf but in haste to be joined with him whom death had taken. For this the gods so highly admired him that they gave him distinguished honor, since he set so great a value on his lover. And Aeschylus1 talks nonsense when he says that it was Achilles who was in love with Patroclus; for he excelled in beauty not Patroclus alone but assuredly all the other heroes, being still beardless and, moreover, much the younger, by Homer's account

&gt;  there is no sort of valor more respected by the gods than this which comes of love; yet they are even more admiring and delighted and beneficent when the beloved is fond of his lover than when the lover is fond of his favorite; since a lover, filled as he is with a god, surpasses his favorite in divinity. This is the reason why they honored Achilles above Alcestis, giving him his abode in the Isles of the Blest.
“So there is my description of Love—that he is the most venerable and valuable of the gods, and that he has sovereign power to provide all virtue and happiness for men whether living or departed.”

The inflatable launches used could make it only 15m max from shore. Typically the smugglers were in contact with the NGOs to arrange collection. Larger vessels in turn could transfer people from smaller NGO boats further out.


The journey from Lybia (2015 stats) was 500 miles from the collection point to the port in Sicily. Nearest safe harbour could be as little as 30 miles away in Tripoli or port in Tunis.

707,"&gt; Big companies like Google and Facebook use IP tracking very effectively

User profiling through both 3rd party cookies and IP address is indeed a thing. But, again, 3rd party cookies are easy to avoid (default browser settings is to turn them off in most browsers) and IP addresses can be obfuscated via a single click (by launching TOR). On top of that, IP addresses can be highly inaccurate. Depending on where you are your phone could have 20 different IP addresses throughout the day, or you might share an IP address with your whole apartment building, your even your whole district.

IP addresses are usually too dynamic and too broad to identify you with any amount of precision. There are cases when this is not considered true under EU regulations (various court cases starting from 2012 all the way to 2018), but generally speaking it is the case (even under EU regulation). But, again, if you are really that worried about IP just use TOR for any website that you are worried about. Other than video and music streaming website (which, in most cases, require an account anyway), TOR will allow your to browse more than fast enough and literally anyone can use it. (though I would call it overkill).

&gt; That is the wrong approach, mainstream websites should be the ones who make it clear how data is gathered and used, and offer an opt-out.

So... mainstream websites should be treated as common property of sorts ? Governed by a centralized body that represents the people to cater to what said government deems to be best for those people. ",Ireland,/r/europe/comments/8vhvb4/gdpr_and_so_it_begins/e1nr4zz/,elcric_krej,1530544177

715,"&gt; No, I'm asking how specifically it affects you negatively when for example website XY has a few ad or analytics scripts installed that track some of your behavior, or what products you bought etc. and use this to present you better targeted ads or the website in question uses the analytics data to improve your user experience or their ad revenue, without asking you for your permission?

It affects me in the same way as if I had to take a shit in a public bathroom with the door open and someone watching me in order to ""improve the customer experience"". I feel weird and uncomfortable.

&gt; all of this is nothing I would specifically seek privacy from, so GDPR ultimately doesn't provide any benefits to me.

Good for you. Others disagree. You are free to turn on tracking if you want.

&gt; If the majority wants it, so be it, but as you probably know, what the majority wants isn't always the best standard to go by.

OK. So what's the argument for that the majority is wrong here then? The fact that they get better target ads that they don't want? You keep talking about it like it is something _good_ when in fact the majority sees it at something bad. Perhaps that is the fundamental underlying difference?

&gt; I don't think it's really that bold to recognize that the legislation that representatives push through occasionally doesn't actually line up with what the majority of their constituents want. That happens on both national levels as well as on a supranational level in the EU.

Really? Because I'd claim that on average a representative democracy represents the people quite well. There are exceptions, of course, but you said it like it is some general truth.

&gt; Since I just read an article about Italy, the EU &amp; migration, I guess I can use that example... and I don't really want to start a tirade here, but let's just say that what various national governments as well as EU electives have done so far with regards to migration from certain areas doesn't really line up with what the majority of the European population wants.

Really? Do you have some data on that?

&gt; That's why we've been seeing populists like Salvini gaining ground lately.

It's worth keeping in mind that most people in Italy did not vote for Salvini. Also, what about all the populists _losing_ ground in various countries? The EP does not represent Italy, so it should be no surprise that the EP does not reflect the will of the Italian people. The EP reflects the will of all EU-citizens. Saying that the EP does not represent the will of the people because Italians disagree, is as absurd.

732,"&gt;Even if we take the high value (it's almost certainly much closer to the lowest one), we would still be growing reasonably well even without receiving any funds

Let's compromise on 1 percent or so. Take into account this is annual growth. That means the economy would double every 70 years. That's for from as irrelevant as you argue it is when stating that EU funds are mainly spend on ""water slides and bike lines"".

On that matter:

&gt;Considering that it was spent on rebuilding a country devastated by war, and not on water slides and bike lines like EU funds are, I'd wager its impact was incomparably bigger, even if the latter might have been bigger in monetary terms.

We have a very different impression of how funds are spend. About 25% are spend on infrastructure (which also means employment) , 15% on small to medium companies, 10 to R&amp;D while social inclusion (which I would consider the ""waste"" expenses) is only 8%. Factually speaking, an extra 1% annual growth is **massive** especially when including the fact that this extra will only support further investments later down the road.

&gt;And again, we avoided the economic downturn primarily due to two factors that are not at all with the EU

Why do you think Poland might have a strong internal market? Certainly, it is because Poland is so great and can't be related to the massive investments from somewhere in this specific market right? And in regards to devaluation, I am utterly tired of people who pretend it is a magical solution with no downsides. Many countries have followed a regime of efficient devaluation and they just continued to decline. The reason why it worked for Poland is that it was in an economic situation that allowed it to take the hit.

&gt;Getting rid of commies and reintroduction of capitalism.
Getting rid of occupying Soviet troops, and their quislings.

Russia got rid of the soviet troops and definitely introduced capitalism. Yet it was an utter disaster. There is more to the succes on Poland than just the nobrain move of stopping communism from strangling it.

762,"&gt; But do you have any examples? Comparable to how the Nazis used to lock up villagers in a church and burn them. Not just burning an empty village

Nope. But the USSR army on their way to Berlin was an army fueled by vengeance. I did find somethings on wiki.

&gt;According to historian Norman Naimark, statements in Soviet military newspapers and the orders of the Soviet high command were jointly responsible for the excesses of the Red Army. Propaganda proclaimed that the Red Army had entered Germany as an avenger to punish all Germans.[86]

&gt;Some historians dispute this, referring to an order issued on 19 January 1945, which required the prevention of mistreatment of civilians. An order of the military council of the 1st Belorussian Front, signed by Marshal Rokossovsky, ordered the shooting of looters and rapists at the scene of the crime. An order issued by Stavka on 20 April 1945 said that there was a need to maintain good relations with German civilians in order to decrease resistance and bring a quicker end to hostilities.[87][88][89]

&gt;Accordingly, all evidence — such as reports, photos and other documents of looting, rape, the burning down of farms and villages by the Red Army — was deleted from all archives in the future GDR.[97]

&gt;Not to say we should whitewash what the red army did in Europe. But I get what you mean.

The Soviets were utter cunts. They raped their way to Berlin. I dislike that the allied rapes and looting and the German ones are never addressed. The former comes up to compare the allies to the Nazis and the latter comes up only regarding the Western front.

I also dislike the disconnect about the eastern front, you had these men and women surviving the largest military confrontation in history, which was basically a race war. They passed millions of bodies, they have seen the rivers turning red from the blood when the corpses thawed. These people had no humanity left.

&gt;""We were young, strong, and four years without women. So we tried to catch German women and ... Ten men raped one girl. There were not enough women; the entire population run from the Soviet Army. So we had to take young, twelve or thirteen year-old. If she cried, we put something into her mouth. We thought it was fun. Now I can not understand how I did it. A boy from a good family... But that was me.[32]""

The people probably excused themselves in the same way when it came to the rapes in Yugoslavia or Poland for example. Turning from a victim to the aggressor is really simple. A lot of criminals are victims in their childhoods and then they become the aggressors. It was probably very similar, these people went from being on the verge of extermination to being basically gods.

&gt;A woman telephone operator from the Soviet Army recalled that: ""When we occupied every town, we had first three days for looting and ... [rapes]. That was unofficial of course. But after three days one could be court-martialed for doing this. ... I remember one raped German woman laying naked, with hand grenade between her legs. Now I feel shame, but I did not feel shame back then... Do you think it was easy to forgive [the Germans]? We hated to see their clean undamaged white houses. With roses. I wanted them to suffer. I wanted to see their tears. ... Decades had to pass until I started feeling pity for them.""[33]

If Soviet sources are to be believed some people were punished for shit like that

&gt;According to Oleg Rzheshevsky, head of war history at the Russian Academy of Sciences[27] 4,148 Red Army officers and ""a significant number"" of soldiers were convicted of atrocities for crimes committed against German civilians.[29] Makhmut Gareev noted that the Soviet military leadership signed an executive order on 19 January 1945 that demanded the prevention of cruel treatment of the local population.[29]

But if your commander didn't give a shit you went scot-free.

Buit my biggest pet peeve is the fact that they can't bring up Soviet crimes without comparing it to the Nazis. All the Lithuanian, Romanians, etc. that say with a straight face how good the Nazis treated them because they didn't oppose them and were not considered subhuman. Lithuanians annoy me especially because the plan of the Nazis was the extermination of 85% of them yet they will tell you about how good the Nazis were in their country, a country where the percentage of the Jewish population that was murdered was 85%, because they weren't targeting them at that time",,/r/europe/comments/8v2cpa/soviet_red_army_soldiers_gaze_across_the_vltava/e1nrryy/,zastranfuknt,1530544766

812,"&gt; July 1 marks the anniversary of the day Turkey banned the teaching of the Greek language on the islands of Imbros and Tenedos, (now Gokceada and Bozcaada in Turkish) both formerly Greek since ancient times.
&gt; 
&gt; Yet, after the rise of Turkish nationalism and the persecution of Greeks in the mid-1950s, on 1 July 1964, the then Turkish government prohibited the teaching of Greek on the two islands.
&gt; 
&gt; The two Aegean islands were Greek since ancient times, as Imbros belonged to the Athenian Alliance and on Tenedos there was a temple of Apollo. However, after the fall of the Byzantine Empire, the two Aegean islands were claimed by the Ottomans and the Venetians, mainly because of their strategic position, both being very close to the entrance of the Dardanelles Strait that leads to the Marmara Sea.
&gt; 
&gt; At the time of World War I, on Imbros there were 8,000 Greeks and on Tenedos near 3,000. Until 1920 they belonged to the Ottoman Empire. After Turkey and Germany lost the war, the 1920 Treaty of Sevres saw the two islands granted to Greece, an event that was greeted with enthusiasm by their inhabitants.
&gt; 
&gt; However, the joy lasted only two years. After the Asia Minor campaign catastrophe and the defeat of the Greek army, the Treaty of Lausanne granted the islands to Turkey. The inhabitants of the islands were exempted from the compulsory exchange of populations, with the Treaty providing for the autonomy and protection of Greek residents and minorities in general. Unfortunately, the agreement was violated by the Turkish side.
&gt; 
&gt; As early as 1927, most of the buildings of the island were demolished, as a massive colonization of people from the Turkish hinterland went into effect. The population of the islands was gradually altered, along with the expropriation of properties belonging to Greeks.
&gt; 
&gt; In 1955, Turkish fanaticism was at its peak, leading to the persecution of Greeks living in Turkish territories. The living conditions for Greeks in Turkey had been very difficult. On July 1, 1964, in an effort to alter further the populations of Imbros and Tenedos, the Turks banned the teaching of the Greek language in schools. It was the same time that a large number of Greeks living in Constantinople were expelled.
&gt; 
&gt; In 1924, the schools of the two islands were all Greek, while in the year of the ban on Imbros there were seven Greek schools with 693 Greek pupils. On Tenedos the number was far lower.
&gt; 
&gt; Many Greeks fled the two islands. Others refused to leave their homes. Yet many Greeks withstood, with the mother tongue still being spoken on the two islands. Characteristically, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew was born on Imbros.
&gt; 
&gt; Today, on Imbros there are more than 800 Greeks. On Tenedos they do not exceed 30. In 2013, 39 years after the abolition of the Greek language, the Turkish state approved the operation of a minority school on Imbros. Two years later, a Greek high school was established.",Greece,/r/europe/comments/8vihvy/when_turkey_banned_the_teaching_of_greek_on/e1nk7rx/,groatt86,1530537007

848,"&gt; There is no scientific evidence that homosexuality (or any other sexuality for that matter) is ""right"" or ""wrong"", these notions being truly non-existent from the scientific point of view.

Science by itself does not inherently make any normative statements on how society ought to be. People do that. Implicit in this statement is the idea that empiricism is the highest and only valid standard for intellectual discourse. 

Which in a sense is fair, but only really useful for bringing everyone to the same playing field no matter how they might feel about a thing. But that goes completely out the window when everyone is systemically biased in one way or the other, or when you can never really be sure who is and who isn't.

&gt; As for myself I am ""tolerant"" of homosexuality, but I would never pretend that this is something that necessarily follows from ""education"".

You're right. There is nothing about tolerance that follows from formal education or being cultured. That is a quality that comes from sense and personal experience. There is also the ""tolerance"" we publicly signal to others but do not necessarily feel ourselves or commit to.

Tolerance is also a squishy concept. At the bare minimum it simply means a truce, an acknowledgement of the right of the other to exist. You don't need to be educated for that. You just need to get to know someone who is gay, relate, and see that he is human. And even then, you can tolerate him or that aspect of him without necessarily believing that his predilection is natural or morally neutral.

902,"&gt;Exept often times LGBT folks ""piss off the others"" by merely existing.

""LGBT folks"" aka. gays and other people with a bit different sexual preferences... We have gay marriage already. We have full rights for gays already. What more do they want? To somehow erase the homophobia that will always be around? Good luck with that, at best you get your Pride parades banned altogether. 

&gt;Those pride parades are a middle finger to people like that, as well as a show of strength and solidarity amongst one another.

Showing middle fingers to other people is hardly a sign of solidarity... More like a bunch of retards creating divide in the society and making it just worse for themselves in the long run. 

&gt;Note that I never said anything about ""pissing people off"", just that the feelings of non-LGBT people aren't the concern of pride parades.

Yeah, of course they aren't. Neo-Nazis or KKK or whatever hardly care about other people's feelings either, and that leads to shit like Charlottesville. You really want to emulate the rotten and polarized American society here in Europe?

&gt;And if you're the type of person who stops being an ally because pride parades ""go too far"" or whatever, then you probably weren't one to begin with.

Well, you can only blame Pride parades for that. Before they went into mainstream, I had zero issues with any sexual minorities. Now I have an issue with Pride parades.

Fair enough, specifically for handguns, though looks like New Jersey is currently being brought up before the courts over it:

https://www.nraila.org/articles/20180206/nra-supports-challenge-of-new-jersey-s-restrictive-concealed-carry-permit-system

&gt;Fairfax, Va. — The National Rifle Association Institute for Legislative Action (NRA-ILA) today announced support for an important Second Amendment lawsuit filed today by the Association of New Jersey Rifle &amp; Pistol Clubs (ANJRPC). The lawsuit challenges New Jersey’s restrictive “may-issue” system for issuing concealed carry permits. That system makes it all but impossible for law-abiding gun owners to receive a permit, which is required to lawfully carry a handgun in the Garden State.

-

&gt;In 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit struck down the District’s “may-issue” carry permit system, in the NRA-supported case *Grace v. District of Columbia*. The court found that “the individual right to carry common firearms beyond the home for self-defense — even in densely populated areas, even for those lacking special self-defense needs — falls within the core of the Second Amendment’s protections.” Rather than appeal the case to the Supreme Court and risk invalidating “may-issue” laws across the country, the District began issuing permits to all law-abiding applicants regardless of whether they can demonstrate a special need to carry a firearm.

1122,"my point is that there will be no justice of any kind and nobudy will touch Isreal, no matter how ''unjust'' the situation is. ''International borders'' is also a tricky thing, since there have been many times in the recent history where countries have violated them and nothing really has been done against them (Russia taking Crimea is a good example), mostly because those very same countries hold a lot of power and nobudy again want to bother doing anything. 

''rogue state'' is the one that goes completely by itself and doesnt listen to anyone.....Isreal listens to USA and receives a lot of support from them as well, so its not really a rogue state. 

Nazis declared war on the entire World pretty much, so that was the reason why everyone ganged up on them and destroyed them relatively quickly. Isreal just sits where they are and protects what they have, their border skirmishes with Palestinians are in no way comparable to Nazis going in and invading everything and everyone around them.

1148,"&gt; This is a subreddit about Europe, and Europe is so much more than just news articles.

And so much more than an overflow for r/MapPorn, r/Pics, and r/Tourism.

&gt; Yes, the subreddit was flooded and crowded with pictures but the pictures provided and created discussion, and a sense of community for the whole of Europe. I learnt and saw many different parts of Europe which I was not exposed to before via pictures- this kind of breadth is not possible via news alone, as it is mostly dominated by politics. I agree that these posts could be a bit too much sometimes but the educational and emotive payoff from picture posts was usually worth it.

If you like that, try r/EuroPics, as advertised in the sidebar.

&gt; Usually, good discussion posts and relevant political posts would make it to the top of the subreddit anyway.

And despite the picture ban, similar things still make it to the top of the sub - e.g. art or maps.

&gt; Now although there are more discussions, many of them that I see are dead or of a lower quality.

Exactly what happened with the low-quality picture spam.

&gt; I understand moderating is hard, and reddits upvote/downvote system is not perfect- but those are still pressed by Europeans in the subreddit for Europeans. 

During the peak 'I took a picture on holiday' spam, we got a lot of Americans coming here mistaking this for r/Tourism (or one of the national subs specifically for foreigners, e.g. r/Germany).

Please, stop, you are embarrassing. If you can't discuss something seriously don't discuss it at all.

&gt;As for the culture and language being marginalised well that is what happens when a smaller, weaker culture is conquered by a stronger one.

The only thing stronger on the Roman side was the military genius of Julius Caesar, not their culture. The Celtic culture was, in no way, smaller than the Roman one and without genocide the Romans wouldn't ever be able to enforce their will into the Celts.

&gt;Any ""city"" destroyed was rebuilt.

Bullshit, there are plenty of examples of cities whose destruction was ordered and where never rebuilt.

1381,"Coming from hockey fandom, I'm skeptical of ""they're good because they're winning"" arguments. I've seen my favourite team collapse epically and predictably after riding unsustainably high shooting and save percentages for the first half of a season. Luck is a thing. Poor underlying statistics can be very predictive of the future performance of teams that are looking good based on win/loss records. The low scoring and low number of shots in soccer allow luck to play a huge factor.

They're ranked 70th, so qualifying would have been hard since they're against the European teams (the next lowest team to qualify was Serbia, 34th). But they're the host, so they got in automatically (in that respect, 0 luck at all was required to make this world cup!)

I looked up friendlies leading up to the world cup to see if maybe they were showing signs of being better than their rank. 3-0 loss to Brazil. 3-1 loss to France. 1-0 loss to Austria. 1-1 tie with Turkey. They couldn't beat teams that didn't make it. Don't know how complete the roster were, though.

Russia was in a historically weak round robin group (https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/russias-group-is-the-easiest-in-modern-world-cup-history/), so they had an easy path to get past the round robin, especially when coupled with home field advantage (referees are affected by the crowd https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/home-field-advantage-english-premier-league/). Finishing 2nd in that group does not say much in their favour.

Their goal totals in the round robin are impressive, but they don't appear to have really outplayed the weak Egypt(45th) and Saudi(67th) teams that badly, they just managed to score on practically every shot on target (5/7, 2/3 plus an own goal). That's got to be pretty lucky. Possession numbers don't look great (38% vs Saudi Arabia, 49 vs Egypt) although that may not say much either way because a winning team may just sit back and play defense. Hard to tell much from the Uruguay game because of the red card.

They got outshot 24-7 (9-1 on target) today. Possession 79-21. Play this game 100 times, surely they lose it 80 times.

Anyway, my feeling is this is a team that has been lucky. Didn't have to qualify. Historically easy group. Home crowd advantage. Ridiculously high shooting percentage. ""Hot goalie."" Won a big game on penalties while getting dominated in possession and shots.

Edit: the 70th ranking didn't look right to me. In Elo, they're in the 40s https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Football_Elo_Ratings",,/r/europe/comments/8vb5u9/spain_v_russia_russia_win_43_on_penalties/e1n25bt/,iamasatellite,1530504984

Working here just sucks. The pay is absolute shit. Nobody is going to work a demanding job with which he can barely support his family. As a result the qualified people are running away and half the employees morons who are underqualified to do their job. Then we have a bunch of idiotic employers who can't understand Bulgaria's socioeconomic problems and are very picky about who they choose. Don't forget that also these employers won't tell you that you are not accepted to work, but if they find out you have applied to another place in the meantime will get angry with you. Also the fact that the employers are demanding because they want to business afloat, but the employees are lazy because they are paid fucking leftovers. Add on top of that that you will have to deal with corruption and mafia in 99% of the industries here and that the commies are trying to erase commie history, both ""liberal"" party fighting for turkish superiority and breaking the law each election, the nationalists are trying to sell us to Russia, GERB is trying to drain as much money from the EU and all of these 240 faggots in the parliament  are sucking Peevski's dick like it's their mother's tit and you have the perfect storm for beeing in transition between communism and democracy for 30 years and probably still be in transition when I have grandchildren.

The users should decide what type of subreddit they are interested in, not those that run it. If the people didn't want image posts, then they wouldn't get so many upvotes and would phase out naturally within the subreddit, not Centrally planned ""weekdays no, weekends sure"".

1502,"&gt;Aww we had better time under Russia's control


Aww? Bold of you to start a message like that with such a condescending tone.


Which one of the ""better times under Russia's control"" you're referring here? You mean just the blast we had in 1809-1917 or the other _great_ times we had under Russia's control? Because there are plenty to choose from. Just want to make sure if you have a specific one in mind.


Maybe you mean the great wrath (isoviha), the Russian occupation in 1713-1721? That was absolutely fantastic period of time all over the country, all the raping, torturing, senseless stealing, destroying, taking women and children to be sold as slaves (over 30 000 people from a country of 400 000 people. And that wasn't the only time Finns were taken as slaves by Russians) but especially the murdering. Ah, the murdering, they did such a creative, careful work that even in 2018 our historians consider it to be one of the cruelest, horrifying times for Finland. Russians wiped out 1/4 of Northern Ostrobothnia, and that part wasn't even occupied ffs. You really have to appreciate the effort, I mean let's take 29.9.1714 as a shining example, 400 Cossaks murdering 800 people in one night, using just axes. That's dedication right there. Not to mention those who starved to death after the Russians made sure not to leave absolutely nothing behind as a war tactic. 


But yes, if you don't mean the numerous times of occupations, the time under Russian's control as the Grand Dutchy was one big tea party too. Such a lovely times that people started wanting independence, organized resistance and military movements (jääkärit) and were consciously building a national identity that had nothing to do with Russia. Speaking of that national identity, you see the quote ""Svenskar är vi inte längre, ryssar vilja vi inte bli, låt oss alltså bli finnar"" all the time in r/Europe, funnily enough it seems to always lack a pretty important word (längre). ""Swedes we are _no longer_, Russian we do not want to become, let us therefore be Finns"". But back to the GDOF, yes it was such a blast, the first and second period of Russian oppression, all the terror and forced Russification. But can you blame them? No one spoke or wanted even to learn Russian and the stupid uncultured peasants still wore Swedish flags on their Christmas trees. That's why they had much more crushing methods in mind, but unfortunately WW1 messed up their plans and Finland never got to enjoy it.


But please do cherry pick and make a generalization how wonderful the times were under Russia compared to Sweden. After all, its much harder to actually pick up a book and learn about your country's own history, so please continue relying on reddit's view on these things.

Nonsense. No matter how you dress it up in propaganda the charge to the patients is $40,000.

1613,"&gt; ""Mehmed also had a blood lineage to the Byzantine Imperial family; his predecessor, Sultan Orhan I had married a Byzantine princess, and Mehmed may have claimed descent from John Tzelepes Komnenos.""

Additionally dude was gonna be crowned if he accepted to convert to christianity. 

&gt; Soon after the terrible news from the Levant, Pope Pius II conceived the strange idea of trying to convert the sultan. How this notion matured in his brain we can only guess...

&gt; In this letter Pius II assured the sultan that he did not hate him, since his Lord bade him love his enemies and pray for his persecutors. He went on to point out that it was a delusion to suppose that the sword of Islam could conquer the Latin world as easily as it had the Asiatics, Greeks, Serbs, and Wallachians - all infidels and heretics. But if Mehmed did wish to extend his rule among Christians and cover his name with glory, he needed no money, no weapons, no armies, no navies.

&gt; An insignificant trifle can make you the greatest, the most powerful, the most famous of living mortals. You ask what it is? It is not hard to find; there is no need to go far in search of it. It can be found everywhere: a little water with which to be baptized, to be converted to Christianity, and to accept the faith of the Gospel.

&gt; Once you have done this there will be no prince on the whole earth to outdo you in fame or equal you in power. We shall appoint you the emperor of the Greeks and the Orient... All Christians will honor you and make you the arbiter of their quarrels... Many will submit to you voluntarily, appear before your judgement seat, and pay taxes to you. It will be given to you to quell tyrants, to support the good and combat the wicked. And the Roman Church will not oppose you... The first spiritual chair [the Pope] will embrace you in the same love as other kings, and all the more so accordingly as your position is higher. Under these conditions you can easily, without war or bloodshed, acquire many kingdoms...

&gt; We [the Papacy] shall never lend aid to your enemies, but on the contrary call on your arm against those who sometimes usurp the rights of the Roman Church and raise their horns against their own mother.

* two weeks ago Hungary amended its constitution, a number of new laws are now being made as a consequence
* employees aged 55 or over will no longer receive tax benefits, meaning now they're no longer privileged relative to other workers; the measure came since unemployment is at record low and unfulfilled job ads at record high, so there's not much chance old people will get fired anyway
* the government is phasing out low-tax cafeteria elements, so in 2019 it will no longer give tax breaks for apartment rent, private healthcare, public transport etc. only food and domestic tourism remains I think
* UN calls on Hungary to withdraw the law limiting NGOs, foreign minister says no one can tell Hungary what to do
* someone draws a graffiti with PM Orban sitting on a choo-choo train, the next day it gets painted over
* Hungarian Forint is at record low against the Euro, the government says it's just temporary and plans to take no measures; this is bad news for those planning to spend their summer vacation outside Hungary
* draft of new law which would make the Academy of Sciences controlled by the government; academics were not consulted about the law; a well-known brain scientists makes an act of protest but nobody notices
* an opposition party politician was caught drunk driving, the public prosecutor measured for his immunity to be removed
* a couple months ago all major opposition parties got huge fines for ""finance irregularities"", back then they all said they will not pay; since later the ruling Fidesz won the elections overwhelmingly, now they will have to pay and have started paying
* the nationalist Jobbik party says it has no money to pay, so in turn the state will stop financing it (all parties receive some public aid to keep the multiparty system functioning)

Of course the problem with monarchies particularly those where the monarch is powerful is that you're rolling the dice with every ruler and in the early 20th century Germany and Russia both rolled quite poorly with Willy and Nicky during a pretty dangerous time. 

On the other hand you can imagine a universe in which Willy was like a Bismarck or Nicky was like a Catherine or Peter the Great, and we'd probably live in a very different world today. 

Maybe even poor monarchs would have been better than the scourges of fascism and communism though, but that's kind of a moot point, since it's those poor monarchs letting their monarchies fall apart that lead to those scourges in the first place.

1701,"Speyer/Spires is a beautiful little city in Germany. I live there for four years now. Tho here are many great places to visit, it's not usually mentioned to tourists. Most guides lead you to the big cities like Berlin, Munich, Hamburg, Cologne, Heidelberg, Freiburg, Dresden, Leibzig, Düsseldorf etc.

Actually Speyer has around 50.000 inhabitants. It's located in the southwest of Germany next to the Rhine, which means it's one of the warmest and least rainy cities in Germany and part of the so called ""German Toskana"". But there a several parks where you can cool down a little bit.

If you are interested in the European culture, Speyer is a great city for a trip!

First of all Speyer is known for it's massive cathedral (""Dom zu Speyer""), which is one of the biggest romanic churches in the world. There are a lot of other churches too, like the Gedächtniskirche,  Josephs-Kirche, Dreifaltigkeitskirche, Johanneskirche and Heiliggeistskirche.

Speyer also had a big Jewish community before the 1930s. There's the oldest remaining Jewish bath (""Mikwe"") in Germany. Now the Jewish community is slowly growing again. In 2011 the Beth-Schalom synagogue has been built.

Since Speyer was an important city in the Holy Roman Empire, you can see a lot of historic buildings like the Altpörtel, which was the west gate of the city. In the picture it's the tower right next to the house with the blue/green roof.

You can also visit a lot of museums. I want to mention two: The ""Historische Museum der Pfalz"" (historic museum of the Palatinate) is great for german and french history fans, while the ""Technikmuseum"" is great for science freaks. You can enter big Ships, Planes, Helicopters, Jets, a submarine and a big old steam locomotive. 

As I told before, Speyer was important in the Holy Roman Empire, but Speyer is way older. The area was once populated by Germanic (or Gauls to be accurately) tribes. After Gallica was conquered by Romans, a Roman fort has been built. That was the ""birth"" of Speyer. Speyer made it pretty well during the following centuries, but during the Thirty Years' War, Speyer was occupied several times by Sweden, Spain, France and the HRE.
In 1689 during another French-HRE war Speyer was completely burned to the ground by French troops.
During World War I the manufactures of Speyer delivered thousands of airplanes for the German Empire. In the 1930s more than 100 Jews who lived in Speyer were killed. After World War II Speyer was occupied by French troops. However, in 1954 the St.-Bernhard-Church has been build together with German and French finanical capital – a sign for the recurrently friendship between France and Germany.

If you want to go for a trip to South/West Germany, ty it! There are way lesser tourists than in Heidelberg or Munich and it's cheaper.

This dude is such a piece of shit and it's amazing how many of us realize that and how many others just refuse to see it.

Although Nazis already used violence to intimidate their opponents during elections in 1932 t is true that Hitler became chancelor after a mainly democratic elections.

1842,"This is over a thousand years before the Aztecs.

What you're seeing in central Mexico at this time is Teotihuacan civilisation, no one knows which ethnic group they were or if they were only one or a giant city made up of a bunch of settlers from all over central America. The lighter shade of orange shows Olmecs, Zapotecs and others.

In Yucatan you're seeing the Mayans at the end of their preclassical period, it was never a unified state but a bunch of city states like Greece. 

Aztec history, from their perspective, was something like this:

They came from a mythical land of Aztlan in the north guided by Gods, settled in their promised land where the eagle sat on the cactus, assimilated the local urban culture from previous inhabitants, started revering that culture as an ultimate culture they inherited from great Toltecs, but whether Toltecs existed in a capacity that Aztecs imagined them, no one knows. Then they formed a federation of three cities (two Aztec and one of previous related Nahua group which came before them and ruled the valley of Mexico for a century or two before the Aztecs), and started conquering around as is their divine right and duty, not to mention the loot and tribute they got. 200 years later Spanish came and all those they were conquering, raiding and sacrificing for 200 years rebelled against them and helped the Spanish destroy them.

edit: actually I'm not sure if the map even shows Teotihuacan. Is there a dot of darker orange in the central Mexico or is that just the valley which is darker due to geography of the map? Why would Mayans and Teotihuacan even be of the same colour, they were completely different cultures, and what's even the point of light orange, it covers an area of many ethnic and linguistic groups with different cultures which were never united.",Croatia,/r/europe/comments/8va0zi/the_world_in_200_ad_redroman_empire_light/e1m0ai3/,smee-hee,1530465430

And you're wrong again, since the French revolution wasn't just about Democracy, but the end of a political elite, a legislated class of people commanding absolute power over the commoner. The revolution did lead to a series of authoritarian, then republic regimes several times, but in the end the French Third Republic prevailed over notions of authoritarianism. Also, Imperialism is not incompatible with a Liberal Democracy (nor socialism for that matter, which is why you have national socialism).

The Revolution was about wiping out the politically legislated elite with power over the people to the point even the radical left wingers of the time, the Jacobins, supported private property, it was about making all men equal under the rule of law, with one set of laws for every single citizen, and the absolute opposite of fascist/communist regimes. In today's Liberal Democracies there are no longer any classes, a system of checks and balances prevents the political elite from forming a de facto class as we once had in the Ancient Regime and under Authoritarian governments and the clergy no longer hold de facto political power. Thanks to the Enlightenment, which is what makes Europeans and our notion of liberty from the tyranny of an oppressive state as the fundamental cornerstone of our countries along with one law for every person (no political class/nobility/clergy) so different from your obsolete concepts of state.

When I'm done I come home at about 8pm. This leaves 9 hours and 15 minutes to eat, shower, see my son and sleep. If I have to cook diner when the wife isn't home (she sometimes comes home after I come home), it's literally cooking diner, eating and sleeping.
My free days are spent trying to get some more sleep and trying to get everything done I couldn't do during my working week.

First of all I don't know this guy, he doesn't matter at all. The true bosses are Grillo (the first no-vax of Italy) and Casaleggio. It was the M5s that first refused to do a coalition with the PD 5 years ago,  and even now it was just a political move to get more ministries in a government with Lega (the so-called ""politica dei due forni""). They dedicated months for the negotiation with the League (way more voters of the M5s wanted to form a government with the League according to the polls) and a couple of days for PD to stop at the first no of Renzi. There's a video in which some members of the M5s say they hope PD divides and becomes basically a satellite of the M5s and then get sad when Renzi said NO after the elections in TV.

Renzi was against it because he was accused of being the worst evil of the planet and all kind of insiults (nicknamed by the M5s platform and his leaders as ""Pig"", ""retard"" and stuff like that)  and so he did not want to form a coalition with the Five Stars (maybe he can accept it but only if it's not the m5s to lead it. Which is what the M5s did to Pd five years ago). If you become a junior partner of someone else you disappear.

I wonder why. Maybe it is because population grows and governments in Stockholm or Oslo and Copenhagen for that matter wants to build subsidized tax funded cheap housing on expensive city land. Copenhagen has grown by over 100000 in the last 10 years and it appears to continue that growth.

We are not hiding problems. It has been a political debate topic for years here. Recently the housing major of Copenhagen refused to alter the planning laws. By law apartments must be at least 95 m2. Something the city made because it wanted richer taxpayers in the inner city area which leads to forcing poorer ones out of the areas as smaller apartments gets demolished or combined with others to form larger units. 

The reason you say we are hiding is because it is a domestic problem and the solutions are of course to be found domestically.

&gt;As far as infinite growth goes. Factor of productions land, labor, capital are faced by negative yield fast when you try to increase any of these factory by 1 in production function. It's technology (economic term that could be described as the recipe for the product) that is the only infinite source of growth in production function. It's the technology part that has brought us to this point and it's us creating more and more with less, or with tighter resources.

We just produce more with the same amount of energy and resources. At no point the amount of resources wasted will decrease, only the production will increase.

My grandma's family had a cow stolen by German soldiers. Her father complained to the officer, he jumped on a bike and returned with the cow and soldiers who stole it. He also made a show pretending (I assume) that he's gonna execute soldiers for maraudering, but was asked to let the soldiers go by my family. My grandma and her brother would get chocolate from soldiers constantly, they especially liked my little grandma (she was blond with blue eyes) and would ask her to fetch water for chocolate constantly (officers stayed in the farm were my family was living), she told me she outsourced the chore to other children eventually, as she had more candies than she could eat. 

Then soviet troops came. It was chaotic. They were drunk, dirty and disorganized. When the front rolled over the farm their planes attacked own soldiers and killed a number of them. The farm miraculously survived. My great-grandfather guarded the doors of the barn they kept sheep in, but at night soviet soldiers ripped the hole in the wall at the back and stole them anyway. Later they took all the animals, and the farm. We rebuilt it several years ago. But all the gardens are long gone and we had to start everything from scratch, it was communal land for 45 years of soviet rule.

Its predecessor was built over a Roman ruin - rather unromantic, isn't it? It did *not* burn down along with much of the rest of the city back then because it had been one of the few buildings which had a well of their own. And yet it was torn down on purpose after the conflagration, because the carpenters, stonemasons and architects at the time thought it might be a good idea to build something new while they were at it. 

They didn't just copy the Roman ruin underneath it. I suppose they were just radical medieval avant-gardists, huh?

&gt; *Music is liquid architecture; Architecture is frozen music.*  
&gt; —Johann Wolfgang von Goethe

Classical music is unequaled in depth and beauty, and quite frankly, I wouldn't make it through the day without listening to Beethoven at least once. But for some reason, our ancestors deemed it a worthwhile endeavour to come up with something new, going above and beyond what their ancestors left them. That's why contemporary music is more and something else than the umpteenth reiteration of Beethoven's sonatas. 

Why shouldn't we be able to do with architecture what we did with music?

Parisian automotive engineer and designer Louis Réard introduced his design soon after.[3] His skimpy design was risque, exposing the wearer's navel and much of her buttocks. No runway model would wear it, so he hired a nude dancer from the Casino de Paris to model it at a review of swimsuit fashions. He named the swimsuit after the Bikini Atoll, where the first public test of a nuclear bomb had taken place only four days before.[4]

2310,"The [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principality_of_Sealand#History) has some extremely funny history on this place. I am laughing my ass off reading this.

&gt; In August 1978, Alexander Achenbach, who describes himself as the Prime Minister of Sealand, hired several German and Dutch mercenaries to spearhead an attack on Sealand while Bates and his wife were in England. They stormed the platform with speedboats, Jet Skis and helicopters, and took Bates' son Michael hostage. Michael was able to retake Sealand and capture Achenbach and the mercenaries using weapons stashed on the platform. Achenbach, a German lawyer who held a Sealand passport, was charged with treason against Sealand and was held unless he paid DM 75,000 (more than US$35,000 or £23,000). The governments of the Netherlands, Austria and Germany petitioned the British government for his release, but the United Kingdom disavowed his imprisonment, citing the 1968 court decision. Germany then sent a diplomat from its London embassy to Sealand to negotiate for Achenbach's release. Roy Bates relented after several weeks of negotiations and subsequently claimed that the diplomat's visit constituted de facto recognition of Sealand by Germany.

Like what? Universal healthcare? That started in Europe in the times of empires. Actually, one of the first to implement it was Krupp, weapons manufacturer. US is stuck in medieval times on this one. 


You also seem to forget that Russia has nuclear weapons. And a million men standing army. And uses them globally. They are threat to the US too. Or didn't the news of their attack on Americans in Syria or the fact they supply Taliban with weapons didn't reach you under your rock?

Funny how the ""People's"" party and the ""Freedom"" party are fighting for corporations and against workers rights, while  telling everyone how they are working for them. We got this in the States with the GOP saying with a straight face how everyone would be better off with the freedom to not have health insurance.

The official population of the city expanded from 225,000 to 675,000. Many of these neighborhoods were connected with the city by trams, utilities, schools, and even shared the same cemetery. There was also a politics where the Austrian government discouraged the neighborhoods to join Prague to make the city less relevant in the A-H monarchy.    
Brno and Olomouc had city center and its town halls under the control of German population. Expansion beyond the medieval core would mean that they would lose their domination.

True, but I think it's more than fair if you're going to try to tell someone that their opinion is wrong due to ""X reason"", I expect you to convey that in a reasonably sophisticated manner. I'm even fine with memeing a little bit, but grammatical and spelling errors is not something I can overlook, sorry. You should have a decent grasp of the language you're talking in if you want to look down on someone else.

Curious how you seem to have more issue with me pointing out his grammar rather than him not presenting any meaningful argument other than ""I don't think they're *reaally* French"", despite the fact that he himself is not French, and despite the fact that other French people are *telling him otherwise*. It's condescending as fuck, and the bad spelling only amplifies that feeling.

&gt;rather that speaking good English doesn't say anything about the person except that they don't speak good English. That's it.


Sure, but my original point of refinement and education still stands. It also could mean he's still learning the language, sure, but that doesn't mean I'll accept his views with the same level of legitimacy as another foreigner that can speak English far better than he can (I'm not really sorry if this bothers you, because this is pretty standard in academia). Of course, nobody is forcing him to speak English; he could try to convey his point in his native tongue, and we could try to move from there. But I digress.

2463,"&gt; We're talking about Germany in isolation here, because some people try to make it all about Germany.

So Russia is a twat to all but Germany. For the single country it makes an exception and becomes a good business partner. And Schrodinger's case is just fine and no chance for corruption at all.

&gt; The larger european perspective obviously looks completely different and destroys their narrative, considering this is an intereuropean matter.

I gave european perspective. Or do you want to cherry pick what is europe and then say that Russia is a solid partner?

&gt; So basically ""being happy"" about it makes it fault of the europeans. 

I didn't say that. But as far as I remember, everybody was excited about Arab spring. Given Euro influence in ex-colonies, I'm pretty sure they could have stopped that if they wanted. But it looked like they supported it. So yes, it wasn't big bad US coming and fucking shit up.

&gt; Pretending Gadaffi was a garant for stability when he caused a civil war to explode is pretty stupid, to be frank

Mediterranean refugees scene was quite different back when Gaddafi had power. Quite a few articles were saying that if Euro countries and US hadn't attacked Gaddafi, he'd have stayed in power. Maybe we'd have another Syria, maybe he'd have managed to pull the country together. Who knows. But european countries did play a role in this for sure.

The idea of nation was born in the 19th century, not before.  Damn, you havent opened a history book. Yes being french is not defined by people's skin colour or ethnic background. This reality is not just defined by the law, but by what is happening around us. We have millions of people who have immigrant background, who were born and raised in France, speak french etc, oh yeah and french people with black skin who were french for generations and generations...yet people bitch hard and categorize them into a sub citizenship category (*français de papier*, amarite) because ohmygod their skin is not pure white.

Oh, I don't have ""more issue"" with you. The guy is just wrong and racist and, as I said previously, I'm not defending him.

What else do you call the constant praise of Putin,Trump has? What do you think is his endgame here? Just today Trump indicated that he was willing to accept the russian annexation of Crimea.

&gt;Morgan Stanley estimated that Trump's tariffs on steel, aluminum, washing machines, and solar panels, as of March 2018, covered 4.1% of U.S. imports.[10] The tariffs measures were poorly received by the vast majority of economists; almost 80% of 104 economists surveyed by Reuters believed that tariffs on steel and aluminum imports would be a net harm to the U.S. economy, with the rest believing that the tariffs would have little or no effect; none of the economists surveyed believed that the tariffs would benefit the U.S. economy.[11]

So 80% of economists think this will harm the US economy and none think the US will benefit but who listens to the experts?

2645,"&gt;It seems that everyone here leans to the left, no exceptions. Does every here truly believe healthcare is a right instead of a commodity? A commodity which, if you work, will be able to afford, or in most cases would be covered by the employer.

US healthcare is both far more expensive than any ""socialist healthcare system"" in the EU and has worse health outcomes. So the EU way is without a doubt far superior in this case.

&gt;Healthcare can contribute to a significant part of a country's economy. In 2011, the healthcare industry consumed an average of 9.3 percent of the GDP or US$ 3,322 (PPP-adjusted) per capita across the 34 members of OECD countries. The US (17.7%, or US$ PPP 8,508), the Netherlands (11.9%, 5,099), France (11.6%, 4,118), Germany (11.3%, 4,495), Canada (11.2%, 5669), and Switzerland (11%, 5,634) were the top spenders, however life expectancy in total population at birth was highest in Switzerland (82.8 years), Japan and Italy (82.7), Spain and Iceland (82.4), France (82.2) and Australia (82.0), while OECD's average exceeds 80 years for the first time ever in 2011: 80.1 years, a gain of 10 years since 1970. The US (78.7 years) ranges only on place 26 among the 34 OECD member countries, but has the highest costs by far. All OECD countries have achieved universal (or almost universal) health coverage, except the US and Mexico.[2][3] (see also international comparisons.)

This is why Russia, despite upping its engagement in direct foreign interference, is shrinking its armed forces. China too.

The thing is: if you work, you're covered with a health insurance plan by your employer and rarely have to pay out-of-pocket, maybe $15 per doctor's visit. The service is always world class, so are the facilities, and there is zero waiting time.

Now maybe some EU countries have it better, but the two I have experience with, Italy and Croatia, have awful healthcare systems. The waiting times to get anything done are ridiculous, and the medical service is usually inferior to private healthcare providers. I end up paying out-of-pocket because of that on 99% of my doctors visits. So basically I'm forced to pay huge amounts of money each month for a healthcare system I absolutely NEVER use (unless I ever get hit by a car, but that's a discussion for itself).

2690,"&gt;There is no reason why in a society which has reached the general level of wealth which ours [in Britain] has attained the first kind of security should not be guaranteed to all without endangering general freedom. … [T]here can be no doubt that some minimum of food, shelter, and clothing, sufficient to preserve health and the capacity to work, can be assured to everybody. … Nor is there any reason why the state should not assist the individual in providing for those common hazards of life against which, because of their uncertainty, few individuals can make adequate provision. 

&gt;Where, as in the case of sickness and accident, neither the desire to avoid such calamities nor the efforts to overcome their consequences are as a rule weakened by the provision of assistance – where, in short, we deal with genuinely insurable risks – the case for the state’s helping to organize a comprehensive system of social insurance is very strong. There are many points of detail where those wishing to preserve the competitive system and those wishing to super-cede it by something different will disagree on the details of such schemes; and it is possible under the name of social insurance to introduce measures which tend to make competition more or less ineffective. But there is no incompatability in principle between the state’s providing greater security in this way and the preservation of individual freedom. 

&gt;To the same category belongs also the increase of security through the state’s rendering assistance to the victims of such ‘acts of God’ as earthquakes and floods. Wherever communal action can mitigate disasters against which the individual can neither attempt to guard himself nor make provision for the consequences, such communal action should undoubtedly be taken.

2694,"This is absolutely untrue in America. If you work at most private companies as a single person, your premiums are probably partially covered and are just taken out of your check. If you have a spouse covered, you’re likely paying hundreds more per month. If you have a kid or two that are covered, you’re almost certainly paying close to $1k per month in premiums taken from your check if your insurance is good enough for $15 copays with no deductible.

Before the ACA, the #1 cause of personal bankruptcy in the US was medical bills the majority of those bankruptcies were from people who had health insurance.

If you’re perfectly healthy and single, the American system works for you. In other words, if you never need it, it’s a fairly cheap complete waste of money. For everyone else, it’s far more expensive and is less likely to yield positive health outcomes than Western Europe’s systems.

If you have expensive prescriptions or need counseling or need healthcare for a broken leg, you’re likely paying thousands of dollars out of pocket for healthcare a year if you need it, or you’re paying hundreds a month for a low-deductible plan if you don’t. Not $15 per visit.

And that’s if you’re in the top 30% of wage earners. It’s ruinously expensive if you aren’t.

2713,"&gt;The genetic evidence also suggest that the native population massively outnumbered the arriving Hungarians.

Genetic evidence based on 12th century graves suggest contemporary Hungarians preserved their non Carpathian-basin genetic marks.

Graveyards and artifacts are scarcely found from the local population, even before the time of the Conquest.

This could not happen if they outnumbered the Hungarians.

&gt; the hungarians have been brutal in their conquests, not as bad the Mongols but still bad

This is a comparison that has no basis.

&gt; Do you honestly belive that the nomad Hungarians outnumbered the population in the Carpathian Basin?

Evidence suggest so.

Just a fun fact Hungarians were actually semi-nomadic, at least by the last stage of their migration.

2749,"It's not about ""not wanting the US to be the largest hard power nation"", but rather that ever since the Cold War ended, there's been a growing perception that this military alliance is no longer necessary. With recent geopolitical developments, I believe public opinion to slowly find a new appreciation in it, but it's not changing overnight, especially in countries that harbor a certain degree of pacifism.

On the other hand, it also doesn't help when a push to increase military spending comes from a foreign head of state widely regarded as a loudmouth populist who has undermined America's traditional role as a friend and ally by deliberately initiating steps *against* the European Union, whilst simultaneously courting the very people it regards as the threat this alliance is supposed to help against in the first place.

Especially when said push doesn't come in the form of carefully worded diplomacy as is international standard, but rather didactic demands accompanied with outright defamation when talking to his supporters -- which in turn evokes the impression that Mr. Trump doesn't actually care for NATO at all, and was instead just looking for something to make people angry about.

I'd also like to call into memory that this ""best defensive deal in history"" has so far only ever been invoked by one party - the USA - and that it was European soldiers who gave their lives for it.

That's not to say that I don't agree with a need to increase military spending and build up a sufficiently powerful European defense, however. 2% was the agreed-upon goal, and members of the alliance should endeavor to work towards it simply to honor the commitment. I'm just saying I can, on some level, relate to the resistance, when there's a lot of other things this money could be spent on.

That aside, though I support meeting this objective, I also have to say that the 2% GDP is anachronistic and ought to be renegotiated. Back then it might have looked like a smart goal, but as GDP growth continues, it would mean having to spend more and more money on the military beyond what actually makes sense from a strategic point of view.

For example, increasing Germany's military budget from 1.2 (2018) to 2.0% would mean an additional $25 Bn, from the 44.3 it's currently at. This would make Germany the third-largest spender *globally*, right after China, and before even Russia. Does that really make sense? Does the rest of the world even *want* Germany to have the third-most expensive military in the world?

That was in 1892, in the 19th century.

&gt; also[ Unio Trium Nationum].

Medieval nation was not the same as modern nation. It was a political class.

Who were the nations here:

* Transylvanian Hungarian nobility (which had ethnically Romanian members as well)

* Saxons (ethnic Saxons)

* Szekelys (a subgroup of Hungarians)

Who was outcasted by it?

The serfs. A significant of whom were Romanian, but the majority was still Hungarian.

Your assumption is flawed though.

&gt; if we assume that the Hungarians didn't instantly got a majority when they arrived 

Why would we assume that? If we were in the minority from the getgo we would've been repelled and never got to take control of the region in just a few years. It was indeed multi-ethnic, but there is a reason why we managed to come out on top. For that we needed a force larger than all of the other ones combined. 

It's safe to say we had majority until at least the mongol invasion. But we recovered from that, beause the ruling house managed to retain control.

Habsburg times were different. After the ottomans were driven out it was not a priority for Habsburgs to integrate the newly settled people into Hungary. On the other hand, they wanted to germanize all of us. Our language almost died out during their rule.

People like you are the reason why those superstars often break down after being expected to carry a team on their own. You treat them as if they are ""one man shows"" when anyone who isn't blind or infatuated could clearly see that Mbappe wasn't.

Even the penalty he got for his team was mainly due to non-existent Argentine defense. There was no one between him and the Argentine goal. He could just kick the ball forward and run after it; he didn't even need to dribble.

His first goal in the group stage was but a mere touch-in of someone else's kick that had beaten and bypassed the goal keeper.

2929,"&gt; Lech Wałęsa published an entry on Twitter announcing a firm reaction in the event of an attack on the Supreme Court.  ""I am at the head of the physical removal of the main culprit of all misfortunes"".  - The former president wrote.

&gt; According to the new law on the Supreme Court, judges aged 65 and over, including the president Małgorzata Gersdorf, will automatically retire on July 4th.

&gt; On Thursday, the General Assembly of the Supreme Court unanimously adopted two resolutions.  The first of them states that judge Małgorzata Gersdorf remains, according to the Polish Constitution, the first president of the Supreme Administrative Court until 30 April 2020.

&gt; The second resolution indicated that the removal of a significant number of judges from the Supreme Court was a breach by the legislature of one of the fundamental guarantees of independence of the judiciary, which would significantly impede the normal functioning of the judiciary in the near future.

&gt; The following spoke on the whole matter: Lech Wałęsa, on Twitter.  ""If the present team attacks the Supreme Court in any way, I go from Gdańsk to Warsaw after 15:00 on July 4th.  ""Sufficiently Destruction of Poland!  I am at the head of the physical removal of the main culprit of all misfortunes"".  - The former president wrote.

&gt; ""To do this, more than 100,000 strong and disciplined people must be gathered in Warsaw.  With an open curtain, we must definitely do so peacefully in front of the world.  I am ready to do that and I know how to do it,"" wrote Lech Walesa in his next entry.

2931,"Everything is racism to you, isn't it? Anyone can see how few whites there are in the French and Belgian teams. It's not an attack on black French/Belgian players as they are undeniably good; it's simply surprise and shock at how whites can't seem to qualify for their own European teams even though they are still the overwhelming majority in France and Belgium. Instead, the black population, which is only 5% of the total population, often fills at least 60% of the French and Belgian squads.

Some people are a bit worried that we are heading for a future where European countries import all the talented African players, simply give them citizenship to make them Belgian/German/French, etc. and give them all the spots in their national football teams. That will result in no native white Europeans ever being able to play football for their country again and instead only manage teams and pay for tickets - similar to the situation with basketball in the USA.

2935,"It really depends. If a small town has a preserved city center like in this case, then this means plenty of tourists, which brings income and keeps shops open. 

If this is not the case, then it highly depends on the location and wealth of the town. I can name the place where I'm living as a positive example and some of the surrounding places as less positive. I live in a small town with a neat city center, not much interesting architecture though, at least from a local's perspective - it's not a touristy town, but there are a few cobblestone streets and many buildings that are older than a century. There are plenty of shops, as well as a ton of industry surrounding it, including secret and not so secret market leaders, some of which I'm sure you've heard of and some you'll never hear of unless you need a very specific type of screw, industrial machinery or chemical component. The excessive industrial pollution this region was known for is long gone, the air is clean and clear today.

I have more than half a dozen different supermarkets within walking distance alone. You can get practically anything locally. If I wanted to, I could walk ten minutes and ask a local farmer for milk. Just a few kilometers away though, there are three similarly sized towns that have been decaying for decades, with dying city centers and young people moving away. They are not ghost towns by any means and I'd still have little issues living there, but in one of them, half of the city center's shops have gone. I'd wager that the direct Autobahn (which was highly controversial initially, since it's a huge eyesore, cutting through the landscape on massive concrete stilts) and train access my town has is one of the factors that keeps it alive, as well as industry going back two centuries, but it's not the only factor. 

There are trucks from all over Europe on the streets and you can get to several large cities and a large international airport within minutes, yet it's quiet and safe like any small town, with almost no crime (the last murder was, I believe, fifteen years ago). The local police station closes at night, because it's just not needed around the clock (a small number of police cars are still driving around during nighttime, but the cover the surrounding towns as well). It's small enough so that you can recognize many people on the streets every day, but large enough so that you don't know the names of all of them. There are no ""bad parts of town"" per se, except for a corner behind the train station at night that is less reputable, with a gambling parlor and a seedy bar. Kids walk to school alone or in small groups, play outside unsupervised and nobody's worried about anything happening (except for some panicky people, you know who I'm talking about). When I was little, I rode my bike through town, alone or with friends, was always outside except for meals. Growing up, there was one more or less trendy bar/restaurant that attracted teenagers. - It's a sleepy town, if you want nightlife, you have to create it yourself or get to one of the larger cities nearby.

Ethnic diversity has been slowly increasing in recent years, but without the tensions that the aforementioned much poorer nearby towns experienced, where almost all of the issues are due to a small, but vocal and violent minority of Germans who feel frustrated by suddenly seeing people with less pale skin, not the newcomers. As is typical of Germany, there's a bewildering number of sports and hobbyist clubs for all ages. There's unsurprisingly no university (the next one is just fifteen minutes away), but a selection of solid schools until our equivalent of college graduation, and unless you need a certain specialist, you can select from several good doctors, including an excellent surgeon who came here from Asia decades ago, who is the man I thank for being able to walk today after a nasty childhood accident. Right around the corner, there's a small hospital that sees a few emergency helicopters land there every day (commonly at night, *sigh*). The local fire department has some serious kit because of the industry - and they're all unpaid volunteers, like in almost all German towns. 

The town is slowly shrinking (lost around 10% of the population in 30 years), but among my peers, there were many who stayed after graduating, finding local jobs. I've lived in larger cities with worse infrastructure, public transport and Internet (which is cheap and fast here, gigabit is not available yet, but 400Mbit/s are), so that's another reason why at least some younger people decide to stay.

This is by no means a rich place, I think it's just about average by national standards, but there is little abject poverty either. It's not getting better in this regard though, as the establishment of a soup kitchen (open once per week) has shown. This town is not immune to nationwide trends, like the increasing gap between rich and poor. 

I should perhaps describe the lands- and cityscape. Green everywhere, hilly forests and a few cliffs surrounding a river valley. Not spectacular, but neat. If you want nature, you can walk there within minutes. There are two public parks with ponds that attract swans and ducks and in the nearby forests, I've seen foxes, boars and deer. Most buildings are three to five stories high, with bland architecture from the '50s and '60s dominating, there are a number of impressive villas from around 1900 near the town center and a few new quarters with clean, but not too exciting modern buildings.",European Union,/r/europe/comments/8v07tf/street_in_the_old_town_of_pirna_germany/e1kduig/,DdCno1,1530386140

2944,"These publishers filled a niche pre-internet. They offered international peer-review of papers, as well as dissemination. These are critical as dissemination is required for science to progress, and peer-review, while deeply flawed by personal interests, is still one of the best ways we have of giving a ""good science"" stamp of approval to sort out well thought and explained research from flat-earther blog post.

The trouble is that in this era, academia based its entire career system on those publications. And since things dont' change quick, this is still the case these days. So your research may be admirable, you might be on personal terms with the best in the domain who might regularly comment on your blog, but unless you pay the tax and bend the knee to the publishers, you won't get a career. You won't get that research body to give you a grant to hire a Ph.D student and work further on that exciting research because your lack of published papers will make them think you're not good enough. And that is if you get a job at all, since landing your first post-doc/lectureship requires that you already played the game and paid the tax to get enough papers in the first place.

So this is the issue. Dissemination has been solved, publishers are absolutely not needed for it anymore, although they can and do add some additional value by doing the collecting/indexing stuff so you don't have to. Peer-review is also much easier to organise. But... Academia is still stuck in a model where any career is tied to the number of papers in the paid journals. Because that was the case before, and things don't move fast. And working out recruitment/promotion on a different research recognition system takes time, money, effort.

So, we keep paying. Because otherwise we'd be unemployed.",Connacht,/r/europe/comments/8v0mco/elsevier_are_corrupting_open_science_in_europe/e1kdzva/,FishMcCool,1530386296

That's exactly what the 2% target is **not** about. 

Imagine if Germany were to spend an additional €20bn on defence to hire 150,000 soldiers serving for two years as well as €5bn on guns, uniforms, health care and pensions for them. 

We'd be well within the 2% GDP target and the 20% for new equipment in 2024. But did we really further ""the collective defense as part of shared responsibility"" with it? No, of course not. We would have just cheated in accounting and wasted a shitload of money.

it is well documented. It is a dumb solution you have, ill cause 3 violent crimes and homicides to stop 1. 

You are wrong and all real and nonbiased evidence shows this. Your approach is wrong here. You have no factual or logical case just an emotional one. 

You could argue the extra homicides and violent crimes are worth *muh freedom* that is something I cant argue against since it is opinion. If tens of thousands of people and schools getting shot regularly is not as important as you owning a gun that is your opinion. However, if you want to argue guns make you safer, stop crime, stop violent crime, and lead to safer outcomes you will be proven wrong every time. 


There is no argument you can make against this. I get it you dont care about facts or actually stopping violent crime. You just feel the need to have a gun to compensate for your cowardice or weakness, and that is a valid opinion I guess but be honest about it. Stop with the BS because nobody is buying it.

The extra weight came from cuises (thighs) and upper canons (upper arms) being fully enclosed in steel plate.  


  
The reason for the overprotective armour style is that the English, like the Scots, started fighting on the ground, riding to the battle, then dismounting and forming up a solid center of steel and two handed weapons, flanked by hundreds (if not thousands) of archers.

There are no treaties currently in power that prohibit Germans having nukes and I don't think Germany will win in a fight of who did what over 60 years ago. If you mean the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons it does not in any way forbid anyone having nukes, it's more of a feel good, why can't we all get along bullshit piece of paper. Every nation can leave it if they see if it's in the best interest in their country (says so in Article X ) and then promptly join again.

# Why forests are spreading in the rich world

*South America and sub-Saharan Africa are experiencing deforestation, but in Europe it is a very different story*

FORESTS in countries like Brazil and Congo get a lot of attention from conservationists, and it is easy to see why. South America and sub-Saharan Africa are experiencing deforestation on an enormous scale: every year almost 5m hectares are lost, net. But forests are also changing in rich Western countries. They are growing larger, both in the sense that they occupy more land and that the trees in them are bigger. What is going on?

Forests are spreading in almost all Western countries, with the fastest growth in places that historically had rather few trees. In 1990 28&amp;#37; of Spain was forested; now the proportion is 37&amp;#37;. In both Greece and Italy, the growth was from 26&amp;#37; to 32&amp;#37; over the same period. Forests are gradually taking more land in America and Australia. Perhaps most astonishing is the trend in Ireland. Roughly 1&amp;#37; of that country was forested when it became independent in 1922. Now forests cover 11&amp;#37; of the land, and the government wants to push the proportion to 18&amp;#37; by the 2040s.

Two things are fertilising this growth. The first is the abandonment of farmland, especially in high, parched places where nothing grows terribly well. When farmers give up trying to eke out a living from olives or sheep, trees simply move in. The second is government policy and subsidy. Governments have protected and promoted forests for diverse reasons, ranging from the need for wooden warships to a desire to promote suburban house-building. Increasingly they welcome forests because they are carbon sinks. The justifications change; the desire for more trees remains constant. 

The greening of the West does not delight everyone. Farmers complain that land is being taken out of use by generously subsidised tree plantations. (They get subsidies, too, but the ones for tree-planting are especially generous.) Parts of Spain and Portugal are afflicted by terrible forest fires. These burn especially hot in areas with lots of eucalyptus trees—an Australian import that was planted for its pulp but has spread of its own accord. Others simply dislike the appearance of conifer forests planted in neat rows. They will have to get used to the trees, however. The growth of Western forests seems almost as inexorable as deforestation elsewhere.",,/r/europe/comments/8v1qtl/why_forests_are_spreading_in_the_rich_world/e1jty76/,fattyfoods,1530364763

He didn't actually nationalize industry like he said he would, in fact he did the opposite, and he didn't divide industry profits. That doesn't exactly match up with his socialist promises. 

And when it comes to expanding welfare, I wouldn't say that automatically makes him left-wing. That's like saying King Henri IV of France was left-wing because he said: 

""I want there to be no peasant in my realm so poor that he will not have a chicken in his pot every Sunday,""

And one important thing people forget about Hitler's expansion of welfare: It was only for ethnic Germans, not for everyone in Germany. That's not left-wing. Being left wing is about economic and social equality, and only giving these privileges to one ethnic group and elevating them above all others is not economic and social equality. In fact, it's the opposite. You're creating more hierarchy and more inequality. Thus, it is opposed to left-wing ideals.

Moreover, just because he had a few left-wing characteristics doesn't mean he wasn't right-wing overall. His right-wing policies heavily outweighed the left-wing ones.

And no, calling Hitler right-wing is not ""asinine"" or ""dumbing it down"". This is the commonly accepted historical interpretation.",,/r/europe/comments/8us9dl/a_friend_of_mine_went_to_athens/e1jq3ss/,Blue9390,1530358017

Germans like it because having all that personnel around spending money is good for the economy and because they don't have to invest as much in their own defense.

3425,"Well if you go far from them having similiar roots and being much influencal to each other, they developed differently, and as Albanians lacked often of the connections to the West, the greek elite developed (not to mention them having a historical lead) forward, seeing the Albanians and their language and culture as a barbaric idiom. Many Albanians were part of the greek church, spoke greek ( far more than greeks speaking albanian), lived in greece and were part of the greek revolution, but in the end powers promoting a negative relation pushed through. 

Don't understand me wrong, as I seem to blame the greek side for everything, but the Albanian side was more passive as it was very heterogenic in their political affilitation so it took longer for the first modern Albanian nation to be founded. 

And as the Ottoman Empire was weakened and falling apart, the greatest interest of the surrounding powers was it, to get most of the land which will be free to have when the ottomans aren't in power any longer. Problem: The ""freed"" space is full with Albanians, so the biggest interest of the main player's (in this case Greece and Serbia, as well as their allies) goal was to make the albanian population remain silent and hidden so no one else will have a claim on that land, so it was a political interest for the albanians to be denounced as inferior beings (so the usual stuff at that time). 

The biggest fear of them was an unified Albanian nation a.k.a. ""Greater Albania"" , or at least greater than the albanian borders set in 1912 which letore than haft the albanian population outside the new state.

But well, the main reason for todays bad relationship lies in these modern political developments which of course had preceding ones reaching far back and caused a lot of hate, bad stereotypes and images (even without mentioning the following developments of the last century including 2 WWs)",,/r/europe/comments/8urt39/ydna_similarity_albania_and_other_european/e1jmtr0/,mxbxp,1530350150

3515,"Was waiting for someone to pick me up on this one, as in my head it was the most contentious one I wrote.

I may not have phrased it well, but my point is that we see everything that goes on through the lens of the media. Absolutely none of these negotiations we are able to see without seeing it through someone else's interpretation. That interpretation, by and large, is that whatever the EU says is sacrosanct and cannot be questioned, and whatever the UK Gov says is a pack of lies and must be shot down.

Now - the cabinet is not doing itself any favors, but you have to also remember that this is probably the first time that a UK government has tried to actually get anything contentious done in the age of social media. I do not believe that this cabinet is really any worse than any previous one, they just live in an age where they are watched 24/7 and everything is made judgment upon.

Example: when was the last time you saw an excerpt of a private conversation that anyone on the EU side has had about Brexit, making the British news? Do you think that Barnier and Juncker do not have private conversations where they call the UK all names under the sun? Of course they will be - but it will be a combination of that they are more careful as they are better than we are at understanding of social media, and that the press is not out to get them.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/8usa6r/give_us_workable_brexit_proposals_eu_tells/e1jjknp/,Petemcfuzzbuzz,1530342797

Obviously other ethno-nationalist movements can be inspired by Nazism, but it's kind of impossible to be an actual Nazi while not believing Germans to be superior.

Fascism is only tangentially related. Italian fascism didn't even have a strong racial component at all. Obviously you'll find elements of it (hell, anti-Semitism was rampant anong social democrats at the time too). But it’s hardly a core element of Mussolini's ideology. They *did* comply with many of Hitler's demands, though.

I don't know enough about the likes of Franco or Pinochet, but I don't think racism was a central element of theirs either. Dollfuss' Austro-Fascism was explicitely opposed to the Nazis.

3592,"I think you are in the minority here, fellow countryman. I mean, language wise, yes, we definitely have more in common with our fellow Romance speakers, but pretty much any other part of our culture is a mix of our neighbors, including the ones that are not Slavs, like Hungarians, Albanians or Greeks. Our food is probably the best example of the mix (Sarmale, Gulas, Zacusca, Rachiu, Palinca, Kurtos Kalacs are just a few names that our neighbors will recognize almost immediately). Then you have traditions like “Martisor”, which we share with our Southern neighbors, “hora” danced mostly in the Balkans and Eastern Europe, even our fairytales are mentioning “zmei and balauri” which are specific to our geographic region. Then, I don’t know if you remember when we were little and watched “Fairytales from the Hungarian folklore” on TV and they were pretty much slightly tweaked versions of ours. We have the story of “Manole the Builder” who built his own wife in the monastery he was building in order to reinforce it, which was a practice brought by Slavs and they also have similar stories in their countries. At our funerals we give “Pomana” and day “Bogdaproste”. No one knows what these 2 words mean anymore, it’s just something we kept from long ago, but you will never see or hear an Italian doing so. Everyone heard of Moroi and strigoi even if you don’t really know how to define them. Even our traditional clothes are very similar to Ukrainian and Bulgarian ones. We also have Roman traditions and food like Sanzienele or placinte. But those don’t necessarily reflect our similarities to the Italians or the other Romance speakers, but to the Romans themselves. 
What I’m trying to say is that even if we were 100% genetically related to Western Europeans, we would still be predominantly Eastern European from a cultural point of view. 

Edit: I don't know why I'm downvoted since nothing I said above was mean or with ill intention. I just don't agree with the rather simplistic view we are taught in school that we are somehow a mix of only Romans and Dacians. Obviously, we have elements from these 2 cultures, but centuries of immigration from the East definitely left a mark on our culture and according to this map, also on our genetics.

3593,"I didn’t say I have an opinion on it in favor or against. I asked for the rationale behind it seeing as Europe has nuclear weapons of its own through the UK and France as well as the capability to re arm. And yes I am completely aware of the death tolls in WW2 don’t patronize me like I’m some historically illiterate retard. Re read my comment without attributing to it un intended snarkyness or whatever you misread in it.

I brought up this:

Russia invaded Ukraine. A country not in NATO, not in the EU and traditionally within its sphere of influence if not outright part of Russia. Ukraine was the only likely target of Expansionism in Europe because of that. (Belarus being aligned with Russia and the Caucasus region having suffered Russian interference for years at this point)

Poland is buffered by Belarus(though they have very deep ties to Russia) with the only border with Russia being Kaliningrad( which would be impossible to Invade from considering Russian supply capabilities through the Baltic when faced against European(especially British and to a lesser extent French) Naval capabilities. This all considered, adding on top of that the Nuclear weapons held by both France and the UK it seems to me unlikely that Poland would be the target of a Russian invasion.

What other options are there for a continental war? None. Russia is the only likely aggressor on the continent save maybe Greece and Turkey(also very unlikely as both are a part of NATO) or Serbia maybe? Likely Russian targets, the Baltic states, Poland, Romania, all are part of the EU and NATO.

I just don’t see where the threat of a large scale continental war comes from. Belarus and Ukraine mark the end of possible Russian incursion into (the rest of) Europe so long as MAD continues to be the driving nuclear doctrine and there exists solidarity amongst European states either through NATO or through the EU. War at the scale of WW2 seems impossible in Western/Central Europe this considered.

This is all without considering the comparatively puny Russian economy which would have to feed a war effort against dozens of more advanced economies. It would be suicide for Russia to try to fight the EU with or without the US.

So then I ask my questions again. And this time I’ll lay it out even more clearly.

———————————

Do 35000 US troops really act as *the* deterrence stopping Russia from marching on Warsaw?

Why do some Germans support removal and why do others want to keep the bases?

Why does Poland want to have these bases relocated to their borders? If Russian aggression is the reason, why ask for US assistance and not British or French?

If a continental war is as likely as some seem to feel why not develop an EU military force to counter Russian aggression?

———————————

All I want is to understand the perspectives of both sides here, preferably with some actual points as well

Ex. Russia is likely to initiate a War in Europe if the US isn’t present because Britain is unlikely to aid Estonia in a conflict with Russia

That’s just an example, and also unlikely as long as all countries in the European side of NATO maintain solidarity in the face of Russian expansionism",South Africa,/r/europe/comments/8uz0fh/us_considering_troop_withdrawal_from_germany/e1jk3u6/,Roflbattleship,1530343907

3596,"Yep agree - am not as concerned by the immigration as just a figure out of context, but I do think that we need to prepare and plan for our immigration, which we cannot do within the EU.

For example, I would have no problem with 500k immigration a year, if it was (a) skills we needed, that we were training for but weren't ready yet (b) understood whether or not it was short term stop gap or long term / permanent (c) if the necessary infrastructure was in place to support the additional people (d) if the necessary planning was in place for integration into UK society and UK thinking.

On the broader term of it getting more and more difficult over time to disentangle ourselves, I am personally of the belief that we were destined to leave sooner or later. The EU is on a trajectory that as a country we do not believe in or want for ourselves, so sooner or later we would have wanted to leave. So better to do so now than further down the line, when it would've been even harder and maybe impossible.

&gt; Yes - The EU is looking stronger in this negotiation, predominantly because the vast majority of the press in the UK and Europe are pro-EU

Are you aware that EU made a [site](https://blogs.ec.europa.eu/ECintheUK/euromyths-a-z-index/) dedicated to counter the blatant lies of the **British** media?!

EU is stronger by the simple fact that it is bigger. The negative effects are distributed among the strongest economies of the bloc, while UK will take the hit alone. The EU position is united and UK has no clue what it wants even on the very basic details. 

EU has almost all the leverage and UK has very little to offer. 

-Losing the financial capital? So what? The benefits never left UK, so EU is not losing much. 

-Loss of nuclear power? Pointless. The world can take only 100 nukes before the weather becomes completely fucked up. 

-Loss of contribution? UK will pay for many years to come. In the mean time EU will readjust.

-Loss of intelligence power? Maybe. By the nature of the trade you cannot judge how valuable, or not, is the contribution of an intelligence service.

-Loss of voice in different UN-like bodies. Like they matter. Or like UK will suddenly join Russia.  

On the other hand consider only this: exit with no deal means no transition as well. UK can never be ready with all needed by March 2019. If there is no transition, there will be riots in UK.

3841,"Do you really look at the world around us and see capitalism dying? Capitalism is an engine that optimally redistributes labor in a marvelous, beautiful and ingenious way. It is capitalism that enabled us to go from subsistence farming to the life of plenty and luxury that we ALL enjoy today. The poorest people in our society are far better off than kings in the 1400s, and our children will look back at us as impoverished peasants. Capitalism has built everything around you that gives you the wonderful life you have- it just plain WORKS.

I don't deny for a second that capitalism has some very negative side effects, and that it does cause suffering as well as prosperity. But those downsides are completely and utterly overshadowed by the growth engine that has raised us all up, and continues to elevate humanity at an ever increasing rate. 

&gt;It's inevitable because of the theory behind it and because of the self-destructive tendency of Capitalism. You'd know that if you even read the theories. 

I just don't see it. I have read the Communist Manifesto, and found it utterly without merit, but I certainly can't claim to be well versed in Marxist economics. But Jesus told me how to recognize a false prophet: ""you will know them by their fruits."" The fruits of communism have poisoned everyone who ate them. And Jesus was an expert on false prophecy, so I trust his judgement. 

&gt;There is no messiah. Who the fuck do you think my messiah is?

We people of conviction all have our own messiah. My messiah feeds the masses, and turns a small number of loaves into many. Your messiah is dead and rotting under a mountain of corpses.

&gt;Communism has never been tried. We have NEVER had a communist nation.

My friend, communism has been tried over and over and over. It is so contrary to human nature, so fundamentally warped and broken, that it seems impossible to even approach it. All who try become monsters, or are killed by their fellow monsters. Communism dehumanizes us, turning us into mere copies of one another, each as disposable as the one before.

The EU is very aware of this fact and has repeatedly 'leaked' information to paint a worse picture of the UK than it deserves.

Blaming the media for Britain's embarrassing failure at negotiation is ridiculous - the free press have no obligation to take Britain's side. If anything large segments of the UK media - including the BBC - have been far too lenient on the fact that major figures in the British government (particularly Liam Fox) routinely *embarrass* themselves - publicly and privately - with their complete and utter ignorance of the very most basic aspects of international agreements, international trade (esp. the WTO) and the European Union in general.

3998,"""I would give you more time ""  That would be an example of the US taxpayer subsidizing it.  

I think forming an EU army is putting the cart in front of the horse.  The EU is not a sovereign entity and for a military to be useful it needs to be able to act quickly and decisively in a life and death crisis in which people are dying.  

I am a combat veteran and I can tell you that in any deployment there is always a lot of uncertainty even when there are leaders with the authority to act that are very firm in what they are saying.  If you  try to do it in a case such as the current migrant crisis in Europe where no individual really has the authority and there are many different passionately held beliefs among the people that do have some level of authority it will turn into a cluster like the current migrant situation in Europe.    

As Mike Tyson said, ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face.""  Nobody has a crystal ball to see the future but in a life and death crisis you at least need unity of command.  The EU likely thought that it did have migrant policies in place until a million people showed up in 2015 and now they are still trying to sort out what they should do.  That does not work when people are shooting at you.  

I would not appreciate the EU going to Texas  but the EU already does do stuff like that.  They are specificly targeting sanctions to go after republican areas.  That is meddling in US politics.  When Trump backed out of the Paris Agreement, Merkel immediately said that she would just bypass Trump and go to the individual states.  When Trump opened NAFTA negotiations, Merkel flew to Mexico to talk about NAFTA when neither Germany or the EU is even in NAFTA and she has repeatedly told Trump that she can not negotiate on trade issues.  

Trump was talking as the leader of a sovereign country to the leader of another sovereign country.  The EU is some sort of organization.  It is not a country and that is something the Europeans need to work out not Trump.  

Before you can build an EU military in anything other than name, you need to work out the sovereignty issue first.  ",,/r/europe/comments/8up1jm/trump_is_trying_to_destabilize_the_european_union/e1iz36i/,Monitor11,1530315201

They sold us Alaska for cheap because they liked us, were afraid of British Annexation and knew we would not start killing Slavic/Eastern Orthodoxy in Alaska, Alaska is the only state where more than 10% of the state is Eastern Orthodox. 

Im not saying we should abandon the EU, But supporting Europe is getting harder these days, Europe is starting to cost more then we gain.  We really have no actual conflict with Russia. Our relations with Russia simply improves and becomes simpler. We are only enemies with Russia by Proxy...there is simply no other reason.

The EU and Russia are the ones battling over eastern Europe and the Caucuses, we don't have any skin in the game we share no interests there other than NATO obligations. Ukraine is the same, The EU has the goal of Ukraine and Georgia eventually joining the EU, Russia opposes this. We support the EU but we really have no clear reason too. And considering how little the EU spends on military capacity, an expanding territorial burden falls more on the US then the EU.

We no longer have a fight over economic systems; which was the only real problem we had with them. Nor do they support Communist Rebels in South America or the 3rd world. So thats gone too. They are for the most part an Authoritarian Oligarchic Capitalist society...we can work with that.

If we let them Have Syria, our position in Iraq will become more stable. So being on the EU side there is actually hurting our interests. Other then that We could have conflict in the Arctic but the Ice isn't melting fast enough for us not to build parity in ice breakers. Which is already happening and Russians respect that.

Much more Germans had to leave territories annexed by Poland than Poles had to leave territories reannexed by the Soviet Union. In the rather rural territories that Poland lost to the Soviet union only 25&amp;#37; have been Poles when Poland annexed it in 1919 and 38&amp;#37; in 1938. In contrast before the war the more urban coastal German territories have been inhabited by more than 95&amp;#37; of Germans.

4120,"&gt;    Lastly, dealing with too many complaints would just cause additional cost for no gain.   

Article 13 Paragraph 2 states
&gt; Member States shall ensure that the service providers referred to in paragraph 1 put in place complaints and redress mechanisms that are available to users in case of disputes over the application of the measures referred to in paragraph 1.

Now I'm no lawyer so correct me if I interpret this incorrectly but to my understanding this paragraph says:

There has to be some way of contacting the service provider on complaints regarding content blocks.
There are no conditions whatsoever that define how this redress mechanism is supposed to function. Youtube for instance already has such a contact and it's notoriously unreliable. Most of the time service providers probably just point at their TOS.

This Paragraph also gives zero grounds on which to challenge a block in court unless some other law or treaty has been violated. And even if someone would go to extraordinary lengths and sue Youtube over a copyright strike there's very little they could gain apart from having their video up again and perhaps a little bit of lost ad revenue, maybe.

On the other hand, a copyright holder can sue the service provider for potentially millions due to copyright infringement. 

Now I do not consider this prospect balanced at all.


&gt; Filtering too much would make a provider less attractive to its users.

This may very well be how some digitally inexperienced legislator expects things to turn out. Yet, we have witnessed time and time again that when it comes to internet platforms some regular laws of economics do no longer apply. People will still choose an objectively inferior service over a superior one if the former has 1 Billion users and the latter merely 100 000.

&gt; I just trust the EU more than a lot of other people here (a feeling that was vindicated by how the recent GDPR turned out in practice).

I do generally trust the EU a great deal on such matters, too, and GDPR turned out fine.
However, there are two crucial differences in this case compared to GDPR.

Firstly, I feel like the EU parliament is generally not all that considerate when it comes to dealing with (mostly US based) web platforms. In the case of GDPR this worked out great for the user but in this case it is almost exclusively helping copyright holders, especially large publishers.

Secondly, unlike GDPR this is no EU regulation but a directive. This means that the already vague wording can easily be bent by national governments to weaken the position of users even further.

I'm totally fine with adjusting copyright laws to be effective in a digital age.

But first I demand the EU parliament to make it unequivocally clear that there has to be some form of oversight, due process and accountability on behalf of service providers to guarantee freedom of expression in a digital environment.

Otherwise I suspect this to be little more than a present for large media publishers that will ultimately harm my user experience.",European Union,/r/europe/comments/8up1jm/trump_is_trying_to_destabilize_the_european_union/e1ij5hy/,Grabs_Diaz,1530299635

&gt; I get that you're one of the 'sun never sets' lot but really you need to wake up and realise that the days of Britain as a conquering power are long over.

I'm not at all. I'm a realist, reality is that ROI is no match to the UK. Reality is that a country will do anything necessary to protect itself. 

&gt;  Should this sentiment build within the UK the rest of the world will know that Britain has sunk itself into a position of desperation

Yes the UK would be desperate, that's the point. 

ROI likes to pretend it's friends with everyone, that no one will ever want to harm them. It allowed them to appease Hitler, it allowed them to sit ideally by when numerous genocides take place. Reality is that ROI safety has been secured by the UK since it's founding. 

You have been living an ignorant lie. 

I have no desire for empire, and have no desire other than to protect my friends and family. I will do and support anything to fulfill that desire. If that means sacraficing ROIers, than so be it. Price absolutely worth paying.

Nego, ako bih morao da pretpostavljam, rekao bi da se ne protivi on tome, nego ovom drugom dijelu posta. Cinjenica je da u Crnoj Gori kult Titove licnosti, kao i same SFRJ nikad izumrijeti nece, sto je i prilicno razumljivo kad se objektivno sagleda situacija, iz naseg ugla. 

Nije bez razloga Crna Gora, proporcionalno populaciji dala najvise partizana (a i narodnih heroja). Sama ideja o novoj Jugoslaviji u kojoj ce Crna Gora biti ravnopravna republika je za to zasluzna, a njenim ostvarenjem, u ocima Crnogoraca ispravljena je nepravda ucinjenja formiranjem Kraljevine SHS. 

Cinjenica je takodje i da je prije SFRJ Crna Gora u ekonomskom smislu bila ne samo supak Balkana, nego i Evrope u cjelosti, te da je za tih malo manje od pola vijeka, u ogromnoj mjeri sustigla vjekovna zaostajanja za Evropom. Ne treba zaboraviti i sto je ta SFRJ ucinjela za Crnu Goru nakon zemljotresa 1979. iz kojeg je Crna Gora izasla sa preko 1/7 populacije bez krova nad glavom, te sa razaranjima koja su se po svojoj razmjeri granicila sa ratnim razaranjima.

SFRJ je za sobom ostavila Crnu Goru kao srednje razvijenu komunisticku zemlja, sa perspektivom da u buducnosti postane srednje razvijena Evropska drzava. Cinjenica da to nismo ostvarili je prica za sebe, ali ona ne mijenja, niti umanjuje dostignuca SFRJ, tj. same Crne Gore, unutar nje. Da je Tito bio diktator, to je nesporno, isto kao sto je i nesporno da je bio benevolentniji od prakticno svih ostalih komunistickih diktatora. No, kad se sagledaju svi rezultati, dobija se jasna slika zasto prosjecnog Crnogorca u vecoj ili manjoj mjeri trigerruje pljuvanje po SFRJ, kao i Titu.

Nah, Israel is an illegal occupier on those lands, that's what the reality is. 

&gt; And many of the gains were in response to the Islamic countries declaring war on them. 

That does not make annexation and occupation legal. Plus, it was Israeli air force which first assaulted Egyptian airfields, so even that part is debatable.

&gt; Also they already gave land back like the Sinai.

Because they were defeated by Egypt. Not that Israel gifted it out of generosity.

Occupation is occupation, no matter how many years it takes. Greece got its land back from Ottomans after 600 years. Go figure.

Yeah we are not talking about how Israel is, we are talking about the situation there, in which there are two parties and one is not fine, since they have been occupied since 1948.

That's like Nazis telling Poles not to resist, that it did not take them anywhere either.

&gt; If they want Israel to make concessions they have to give something in return that Israel would actually be interested in. 

No, because this is not a trade deal, this is getting back to the normal status, in which Israel had no right over these land in 1948.

&gt; Toppling their current regimes

Their regimes are none of Israel's business. If it was up to me I would topple all the regimes in Middle-East (including Israel) but you see, it's not up to me. We can't just replace regimes or demand that, we need to find a way to get along with people. Unless they attack us directly. And no one attacks Israel at the moment so..

&gt;  That will not happen maybe in 50 or 100 years but can't happen when a large part of your population hates Jews.

Which should make everyone question why? Perhaps the same reason why Poles hated Germans. Occupation, apartheid, etc.

&gt; So the status quo will go on and more Palestinians will be killed and more children will be born into a sad life. Its hard to see anything breaking the circle.

If Israel remains as an aggressive apartheid regime, yes it will go on like that. Israel will always deal with shit like Hamas and Hezbollah, and will waste shit tons of money on army, instead of developing the land and the people. 

War is a two-sided shitshow, it affects both sides.

Marriage although techincally predating Chirstianity in various forms in European nations it holds a very strong patriarchal allegiance to the Church.

&gt; It was at this point that Christians began to have their marriages conducted by ministers in Christian gatherings, but it was in the 12th century that the Roman Catholic Church formally defined marriage as a sacrament, sanctioned by God.

&gt; In Catholicism, it is still believed that the Sacrament of Matrimony is between God, the man and the woman, while the Reformation of the Sixteenth Century CE re-valued marriage as a merely life-long and monogamous covenant between a man and a woman.

Also they already gave land back like the Sinai.
You don't demand stuff from over 50 years ago India isn't demanding the whole Indus river delta from Pakistan either that just leads nowhere. 
Israel is fine with the status quo. If the Palestinians want to get out of their misery and poverty and not be killed anymore they need to act. And by act not trying to fight against Israel on all fronts like they currently do how far has that gotten them?

If they want Israel to make concessions they have to give something in return that Israel would actually be interested in.
Toppling their current regimes, stopping the brainwashing of their children and building a state organization that could peacefully coexist with Israel would be one thing that Israel might be interested in.
That will not happen maybe in 50 or 100 years but can't happen when a large part of your population hates Jews.

With the proposed alternative of ""letting them drown"", you are throwing ""true"" refugees into the same boat (pun not intended) as economic migrants and then collectively disregard everyone's human rights. As an egalitarian society, we should aim to look at every person as an individual, not rubber-stamp them as qualified or disqualified solely by method of arrival.

Otherwise, you'd just condemn a person exactly like the pilot refugee you were referring to to death, since there is a body of water between Africa and Europe, making boats the most likely method of travel.

I'm not opposed to the idea of external ""asylum centers"", *if* the European Union can guarantee adherence to international law and human rights (as opposed to the fucked up shit that's going on in Libya -- this is partially the populists' fault, too).

The earth is (mostly) a globe, so it has 360° circumference. We split that up into latitudes, which are the degrees and we further divide those by 60. 1/60 of a degree is one arc minute. That minute equals a nautical mile.     

Our new maps use WGS 84 and show us the same degrees and minutes. GPS uses the same standard. When navigating, you can take the length of a minute from the left or right part of the map and measure your distances with it.     

In short: The nautical mile is based on the circumference of the world and has a direct relation to it. The definition of a meter is not based on real world applications (today it's based on the speed of light) and we would lose that relation by switching to meter.

From smugglers.

Look at the stats. The amount of arrivals was slashed down by 70 percent in one month last July. Why do you think that was? Because Libyan Coast Guard increased operations?

Bollocks. LCG keeps the return rate at the same level as it was before. The amount of boats dropped dead by two thirds in one month alone and kept that pace. Because main departure point - Subratha - has been controlled by militia belonging to Dabbashi clan. Dabbashi clan were big time smugglers. Dabbashi clan in month of July switched from that to raiding all warehouses where migrants were and amount of departures from beaches around Subratha dropped dead to zero. Because Dabbashi received in that month 20 million euro. So small fish smugglers switched to departure point from Zawarah - Subratha are to Garabulli - Khums area where control is atomized, with no big fishes exercising control. For them, at the same time meant that their options got limited as pool of smugglers decreased to small time guys while big time guys cleared coast west of Tripoli.

4477,"Why should countries who don’t want to take migrants in have to?  The eastern Balkan route produced a lot of non-refugee migrants too, and was far more out of control at its peak than the central Mediterranean route ever was.  Even if they *are* refugees, I think any country should have the right to take in as many or as few as they want.  The EU works better as an economic bloc than a pseudo-country.

Plus, what makes you even think migrants who end up in Poland or Hungary will even stay there anyway?  Lots of these migrants would just go right to Sweden or Germany the first chance they get because they know those countries have better welfare systems and they almost never deport people.

&gt; Italy does (it has a migrant problem too, not everyone who comes there is a refugee), and to a lesser extent so do Spain and Greece. Germany and the non-shithead EU countries are looking to helo these countries who are having these problems purely because of their geography.

Italy created its own problem and did nothing for years to fix it.  If Germany’s (and the other “non-shithead” countries as you so eloquently put it) solution is to distribute an endless stream of migrants that land there, that is a terrible solution.  

I like the migrant processing’s centers outside Europe idea, but who knows when that would get implemented?  Migrants who get rescued in the Mediterranean should get sent to those, or anywhere outside of Europe.

Australian model with camps in Europe? LOL. I'm 99,99 % sure that such camps will not be accepted anywhere in Eastern Europe. Money does not buy all and the population of EE is fiercely against mass African immigration.  

&gt; ""And it will probably not be accepted in North Africa also""

&gt; Says you

The EE don't want to be flooded with Sub-saharan migrants. The North Africans, as far as I can tell, also. So no camps there either. Maybe the EU will have more success convincing an African country further to the South, but we'll see. 

&gt;They come because they want to go to Europe. If European way is closed, they will stop coming. NA countries are also aware of that.

I am also aware of that. What I propose is just to turn the boats back, and thus cut the flow to Europe, without waiting for an eternity for these hypothetical camps, that are not even likely to be accepted by NA governments, to be build.

How did they put pressure?  By creating chaos.

Remember how all the ATMs weren't working in Greece in the summer of 2015 and greeks couldn't withdraw money?

The idea is you force them to take on ever increasingly difficult to pay off loans and also force them to sign off on draconian austerity policies to pay off the interest and the principal.

This way you can dictate policy in the country you want to keep in line (in this case Greece).  

It's a way of maintaining the balance of power in Europe.

The intelligent thing would have been to NOT force them to continue to take loans (as the Greeks actually voted to on -- remember the OXI vote?).  The Greeks refused to take on more loans and instead wanted a more sensible plan to both pay off the debt while also allowing the economy to remain prosperous and stable.  A real solution was possible.  It's not some dirty crooked Greeks ""not paying their fair share"".  But rather it's the political interests in Brussels wanting to make sure they maintain control.

Really.  That's how it is.

4543,"Yes. There are two precursors of Article 11 - one German, the other Spanish. As I explain in other responses, both indicate the introducing this right could have significant negative effects for small and medium sized publishers, or only bite on aggregators other than Google.

The German right, introduced in 2013, has hardly raised any money at all - estimates are around Euro 700,000. Google pays nothing. When the right was introduced, Google indicated it would no longer index German press pubications. The publishers immediately gave Google a royalty free licence. 

In Spain, to avoid similar results (and under the advice of the German publishers who were pushing their legal innovation), the right was couched as an ""unwaivable right to remuneration."" The publishers thought that would definitely get Google. Google's response? It put an end to the Google News service for Spain. The effect: significant falls in traffic to small and medium sized publishers.

These lessons are key to forging an assessment as to what will happen if the new right is adopted. In the Council version, we can forsee simply a relication of the German result; the JURI amendments hint that the European Parliament wants to interfere in the deals press publishers make with ""information society service providers"" to ensure the remuneration is fair and proportionate (and the provision of indexing services does not meet that standard). However, right now, the text is so poorly drafted that its impossible to say whether this is an aspiration (as it appears) or a legal requirement on Member states.

Just LOL. We in the East have already seen how well the numerous ME and African (and some other muslim) immigrants have integrated in the West. Terror attacks, jihadis, rape gangs, FGM, Sharia courts, killing/threatening of cartoonists, limitation of free speech, cutting the throat of a catholic priest and throwing a Jewish old woman over the window to her death because of her ethnicity.

No it was not ""worse""? Jews lived their most comfortable lives under the Ottoman times, comfortable enough to flee Europe to Ottoman Levant and Turkey. How is this called ""worse""? Makes no sense. 

&gt; There is absolutely no evidence to indicate, that the land that is now under Israeli rule would be better if Arabs took it over. 

Two-state solution is better than Israelis imposing apartheid on Palestinians. I never said Arabs should get the whole land and Jews should leave. I am for the two state solution. 1948 borders for fuck sake.

&gt;  If anything, there is plenty of reasons to think it would just be turned into Syria or Egypt version 2.0 (which would be way more oppressive than Israel is now, look how Assad and Mubarak ruled and make conclusions yourself)

There are other states doing pretty well there. Jordan is fine, for instance. So we could have Jordan 2.0 instead of Syria 2.0. It's all a speculation at this point, and I see no point in discussing that any further. I simply said your prediction doesn't hold a value since we cannot just write history or predict future clearly as you did above. 

Occupying Palestine just because they predict Palestine would be Syria 2.0 is not a political argument, rather an excuse. It does not give any authority to use military power over a land.

4678,"&gt; Of course it is.

It was implied that the website would collect data for the functioning of the website not for making money. I've never seen a notice telling me that the website is collecting data on me to share it with third parties for money. They are always about improving usability or providing data. So no, it never was implied.

&gt; You meet Jack and try to make friends with him. You tell him your name and you hang out. You don't know if Jack goes and tells somebody else about you, but it's 
implied that if you come up then he will.

Right of the bat you go the wrong way. My and Jacks interaction is personal, face to face and I can be reasonably assured that there are no unknown parties collecting data on our interaction. After our interaction I don't know if he will tell somebody about me but he also doesn't know if I will tell somebody about him. The interaction is in no way similar to an interaction between me and a website. 

&gt; You meet Jack and try to make friends with him. You demand to know who he is going to tell information about you before you even tell him your name. When he explains all that you then demands that he must not tell anybody anything about you. He must pretend like you don't know one another. If he doesn't comply then he gets fined €20 million.

Now we are in a forest.

I meet Jack and try to make friends with him. He tells me that for us to interact, a few, unknown to me, third parties need to listen on our interaction and that I need to take a small tracking device from him that will track me even when I stop interacting with him. On receiving that information I decide that I actually don't want to make friends with Jack. That is what GDPR does. 

To quote my self.

&gt; Your analogies are really bad.

An analogy to show why your point is total nonsense.

You meet Jack and say Hi to him. Jack takes your wallet. By interaction with him you opted in to him taking your wallet because that is what he requires from people to interact with them.

Some friendly advice. Don't sign contracts that you can't read.

4692,"&gt; Would you agree with me, that if we had standardized European asylum rights and processes, a quota system is the only fair solution?

I'm very doubtful about that. Let's be honest, it has been Greece, Italy etc. taking the migrants, while we have very little say over what to do. It's like we're being made to be responsible for decisions other countries take, and on such a sensitive topic.

It's even worse considering immigration and integration is probably that one topic people consider Western Europe to be utterly failed at. Just imagine Brussels telling you need to take X amount of Muslims, while city of Brussels is already 25% Muslim, and hosts terrorist nests. Even disregarding my very negative opinion of this, it could have the potential of pushing far-right to power across CEE. I also wouldn't be sure same couldn't happen in Western Europe. Everybody would lose from this.

That's why we're saying here and now, obligatory refugee quotas are a red line and there's no crossing it. It would be best for all that this is forgotten.

&gt; Imagine, god forbid, Russia descends into civil war and 1 Million Russian refugees apply for asylum in Estonia. Is it Ok in your opinion if Poland, Germany and the rest of Europe just close their borders and tell the Baltic states it's none of their business?

Absolutely, if Baltic States acted as immigration pump, bringing in more and more every year, with Russia's living standards being several times worse and yet population exploding to several billions by mid-century, indicating possiblity of immigration wave so huge that it could turn out to be fatal to Europe.

&gt; But Orban, Kaczynski and others flat out refuse to talk about quotas even after securing external borders and establishing common European asylum processes.

There needs to be other mechanism and pressure applied, though. I agree that EU countries *should* take in refugees to at least some extent, they need to cooperate and find compromises.

4694,"&gt;Your link says nothing about Croatia being a successor.

 I don't know what were you reading but the chapter I linked is all about about shared succession : ""Eventually, after the overthrow of Slobodan Milošević from power as president of the federation in 2000, the country dropped those aspirations, accepted the opinion of the Badinter Arbitration Committee about shared succession, and reapplied for and gained UN membership on 2 November 2000.""

&gt;Croatia seceded from Yugoslavia while it still existed.

Yugoslavia was dying for a long time, and by June of 1991 it de facto didn't exist anymore. Slovenia and Croatia declared independence, and then couple of weeks later agreed to suspend their declarations for 3 months to negotiate a settlement. After those 3 months it became absolutely clear that Yugoslavia no longer existed and could not be saved so Slovenia and Croatia confirmed their earlier declarations of independence.       

&gt;It is a successor of WWII Croatia

No, it is most definitely not.

Katy Hayward has worked at Queens University, Belfast and has twenty years’ research experience on the impact of the EU on the Irish border and peace process and is clear that [""Technology cannot make post-Brexit Irish border frictionless""](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/07/technology-cannot-make-post-brexit-irish-border-frictionless-says-academic). 

Bearing in mind that this is a border where [there are more border crossings than on the whole of the EU's eastern border](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-40949424) and that the terrorists [have been making a shitload of money from cross-border smuggling](https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/jan/06/northernireland) for a long time, a situation that will be exacerbated by Brexit. [The Police chief of NI is also clear that a 'hard Brexit' Irish border would be a target for paramilitaries](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/feb/07/n-ireland-police-chief-says-hard-brexit-border-posts-would-be-paramilitary-target)

As for regulatory alignment, [the UK government has been repeatedly asked what exactly this might mean](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2018/01/26/the-uk-needs-to-clarify-what-full-regulatory-alignment-means-before-the-next-phase-of-the-brexit-talks/) without success. The Unionists have made it clear that NI and the mainland must not diverge but that means the mainland has to stay in the CU, but this is anathema to the headbangers in the Tory party. 

Let's not forget, that even the Tory party has acknowledged the fruitlessness of MaxFac (and it's variants) by moving on to suggesting a [10km DMZ](https://www.irishnews.com/news/northernirelandnews/2018/06/02/news/border-buffer-zone-dismissed-as-fantastical--1345822/) along the border which would incidentally take in Arlene Foster's house.

If we insist on this folly, then the repercussions will be many and serious. Paramilitaries on both sides of the sectarian divide and looking with joy on these developments - Republicans see a chance for a united Ireland through violence and Loyalists will violently resist them. Very recently, George Mitchell (one of the main facilitators if the Good Friday Agreement) has issued a warning and urged all sides to [recognise what was at stake](https://news.sky.com/story/good-friday-agreement-chair-george-mitchell-issues-brexit-warning-11322896). To think the NI/ROI border is all about lorries with milk crossing back and forth is both a gross over-simplification and a dangerous downplaying of its historical importance to the people of Northern Ireland. To suggest, as Boris Johnson did, that it is somehow akin to [crossing between Camden and Westminster](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-43208893), is wrong-headed, mendacious and completely typical of someone who believes the huge problems inherent in Brexit can be resolved with a bon mot and a dismissal of the opposition concerns

Spreading out the refugees and not allowing them all to gather in ghettos in western Europe literally has the opposite effect of ""brutalizing society"" since divided migrants are infinitely easier to integrate into society, commit less crime and gives less incentive for likeminded people to migrate to their ghettos because it ""feels like home"".

So yes, expensive as fuck.

Also no Europe simply cannot take on every migrant from Africa. The population is rising by 2.5% each year which has been a constant number for decades. This year it means a growth of 30 million. If the situation is so bad that people want to flee, it only get's worse when demand for food rises even more.

Illegal migrants actually even make solving the issues even harder. The funds required to house 1 person in Europe would be enough to fully provide for 10 Africa. And as Europe does not have infinite money, as Greece has clearly shown, the funds required to handle illegal immigration, legal immigration and asylum have to come from somewhere, and that will hit development aid for Africa at some point.

And what do illegal immigrants expect to achieve in Europe? The and their children will be at the bottom of the social and economic ladder for a long time. Their education and training they gained in Africa, is worthless. The jobs that remain are bottom of the ladder, minimum wage type of jobs.

And when it comes to those jobs, there are even now not enough available to put our people into work. So increasing the pool for people while the pool of work stays the same will put those without the language skills required at a huge disadvantage.

And even if that disadvantage wouldn't be there, it cannot be the solution to replace our poor people with African poor people.

I don't want anybody, in Europe or Africa, to suffer and i am a staunch defender of the right to asylum. But economic migration, illegal or legal of the worlds poor people to Europe will bring no gain to anybody but maybe the people who migrate. Europe suffers, Africa will suffer.

The only solution is if Africa get's its shit together. And especially for that you need people who are willing to risk something to make that happen.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/8uprgm/eu_leaders_agree_on_migration_after_latenight/e1hga1u/,Alcobob,1530251831

This research concerned (among other things) art. 11 of the proposed Directive. You find the results on ssrn.com (see my publications together with Dr. Maximilian Kerk, Dr. Miriam Buiten and Prof. Klaus Heine).

4915,"Historically, like 150 years ago the population of just the NorthEast of the Country was double that of the South. (that's why the South lost the Civil War). The South was a poor rural area up until World War II. (all of my grandparents were born on farms in Mississippi). There was very little immigration or migration to the South before the 1940s because none of the immigrants wanted to move to the poorest part of the US, they wanted to go to the big cities in the North East, or Chicago in the Midwest, or out to California. Except Texas, Texas is special because it's always been a very wealthy and developed Southern State due to oil and cattle ranching. 


Then during World War II the South industrialized very quickly during the war and the A/C was introduced. For the last 50 years there has been a huge migration both internally and from foreign immigrants for the first to the South since the cost of living is cheaper, houses are cheaper, government is way more pro-business, the economy grows faster and taxes are lower. Now there's over 120 million people living in just the SouthEast. 


There is so much more land in the South than in the NorthEast of the country that you can own a big home and be hood rich in the suburbs of Southern cities. Nowadays, all the big cities in the South are comparable in development to that of the North so the experience is pretty similar I'd say. Most urban southerners of my generation don't even have strong Southern accent any more but just a general American one, though everyone says y'all still.

4960,"&gt; Oh, please not this determinist bullshit again.

Speaking of determinism and your flag, I read an interesting piece a while ago that argued Poland was basically determined to be partitioned and its former lands ultimately ruled by Russia and Germany.  The argument was that as nation-states became more consolidated and amassed larger industry and miltiary-arms they'd fear each other more.  This appeared to both Russia and Germany who felt if either controlled Poland entirely it would put them too close to the other for the other to feel secure.  Therefore the only realpolitk option was to conquer Poland, which both did or attempted several times during the partitions and after.

Even today while Poland still exists its nevertheless still part of a German-Russian dynamic with Germany having the advantage in Poland with a greater integrated economy and sharing a security alliance.

This may be a bit contrived though, its taking historical events and creating a convenient explanation that seemingly ties up everything simple and nice when in reality the history is more complex.  But I think you can look at other examples like Central Asia (stuck between the British Indian and Russia) or Korea (stuck between China and Japan) for examples of a similar story playing out about a relatively weaker country stuck between two more powerful ones.

It throws away the realities of economics and replaces it with a romantic fight between oppressors and oppressed. And not only that, his solution is to commit violence based on false presumptions!

Well that is exactly what she is working on, is it not?

&gt;  With the reversal of material, we have abolished the dynamic availability management, as well as the rigid upper limits of the main weapon systems.

[From last year](https://www.dbwv.de/aktuelle-themen/politik-verband/beitrag/news/bundeswehr-plaene-heer-soll-drei-volle-divisionen-bekommen/):

&gt; The Bundeswehr is apparently facing fundamental changes in its tasks and equipment over the next 15 years. This is the result of the ""Provisional Conceptual Guidelines for the Future Capability Profile of the Bundeswehr"", which originate from the planning department of the Ministry of Defense and on which the ""FAZ"" reports. To DBwV, the paper is also available.
&gt; 
&gt; The plan is to radically change the Bundeswehr's current focus on foreign missions by 2032. The tasks should once again focus primarily on national and alliance defence. The responsible head of department in the ministry, Lieutenant General Erhard Bühler, speaks of a ""departure from the requirements of the realignment of 2011"". 
&gt; 
&gt; A step-by-step approach is planned.
&gt; 
&gt; Current mandated assignments are to be secured by the end of 2023 and additional responsibility is to be assumed between 2019 and 2023. Germany acts as a framework nation for the Very High Readiness Joint Task Force with a system network of brigades and the participation of forces from the air, sea and special forces.
&gt; 
&gt; In the second step, the first step towards comprehensive capability for alliance and national defence is to be taken by 2027, for which the task-oriented equipment for the first system networks is to be achieved.
&gt; 
&gt; **The third step is to be completed with the achievement of task-oriented equipment for all active and partially/non-active units by 2031.**
&gt; 
&gt; After 2032, the Bundeswehr should then be able to perform all other tasks on an equal footing on the basis of mission packages.
&gt; 
&gt; In general, simultaneity is one of the most important design parameters. The planning distinguishes between three cases of national or alliance defence:
&gt; 
&gt; 1) Parallel to Alliance measures below the threshold of the Alliance case, all tasks (including other tasks to be performed on a permanent basis) must be performed with equal priority.
&gt; 
&gt; 2) National crisis preparedness must also be ensured in parallel with collective alliance defence.
&gt; 
&gt; 3) in the event of a mission in national defence, however, all other missions may be cancelled.

&gt; Add in that the head of the Luftwaffe was actually fired because he supported an off-the-shelf solution for the Tornado replacement(F-35)

Is there any evidence for that?

&gt; Karl Müllner turned 62 last month. That's retirement age in the Bundeswehr.
&gt; 
&gt; His predecessor was Aarne Kreuzinger-Janik, who retired in 2012, with 62. The predecessor of Kreuzinger-Janik was Klaus-Peter Stieglitz, who retired in 2009, with 62.
&gt;

Was it really an invitation to anyone but Syrian refugees? Given the origin countries, I feel like the current migration crisis would have come no matter what; Mrs. Merkel just makes for a convenient scapegoat. I'm not sure we should condemn European politicians for following through on what the Union's Charter of Fundamental Rights preaches as the EU's humanitarian values, nowadays even to the point of cheering on hardliners who violate existing agreements and regulations. I've even seen posters advocate letting refugees drown to ""send a signal"". It's kinda sad how far we have moved away from what used to be our ideals, especially when, whilst certainly being a crisis, the current situation is nothing we should not be able to handle, if only we'd be willing to talk things through and move as one.

Either way, migration pressure will only get worse over the coming decades, as a consequence of global warming and stagnating or deteriorating security and economical situations in various third world countries (which we are not entirely innocent in), so rather than letting populists play national interests against neighbouring countries' national interests, we should perhaps reflect on what this Union is supposed to stand for, harmonize and improve asylum application processes, increase burden-sharing among Member States, and increase development and intervention in the regions where this migration is sourced to help alleviate the causes.

The alternative would be pretty bleak.

&gt; The US doesn't really have DOP/IGP labels because those are considered generic.

but DOP/IGP can dump at least a 15% (..at least!) on retail prices (I..mean, I'll never ever pay more for a Parmigiano/Grana/Mozzarella made in Houston/NJ/NY or whatever... and I guess same goes for 500M Europeans, same goes for scotch, fromage etc...) even if are Italians that made it...but, in the US (as you said, for you are ""generic"" or ""style"") ...

&gt; Like California only started making wine a few decades ago and now it's really popular. But when California first started making wine, the french and everyone else laughed at them for thinking they could compete with french wine.

..and same goes for wines, Californians imported ""cultivar"" from EU (Chardonnay, Sauvignon, Cabernet...all Eu well known since 500yrs, at least, cultivars, thanks to ancient Greeks and ancient Romans, and years ago, US sommeliers got scammed...cuz, you ""lack"" of IGP/DOP or whatever in English is... is not ""your"" heritage...)

5067,"&gt; ...that is the same in S Italy / S Europe... simply, given the climate changes; Southern Europe (be aware, I'm from Lombardy...) a shift from 1000 to 100 (as your grandpa) can't be switched to soybeans, or corn, or rice (even if Piedmont in N Italy did it and still can do it, and even Veneto...) so, if a climate change happens, your grandpa lost 9900 cattles in LS alone, (probably moved N in the US...cuz climate changes).. you US can still rely on Iowa, Indiana and other ""breadbaskets""... for ""big commodities"" (?) while Europe can't rely on (example) Ukraine (100+yrs the granary of EU)...



We still could have 1,000 cows if we wanted, it's not really about the weather so much as about the economics. Back 50 years ago we used to just have cows everywhere, like we didn't even bother to count them. Nowadays, it just doesn't make sense to have that many cows for us because it would not be profitable. (Farming in the US is very large scale). The most profitable ranches are out west and have 1,000s and 1,000 of cattle (huge economies of scale). We just have 100 cows to keep the pasture from getting overgrown and more as a hobby. The only limitation to how many cows you can have is your amount of land and water, and we still have lots of water where I live. 


Right now we are investing a lot of money to put in an irrigation system for the corn and soybeans and we are building a 30 hectare lake to store water. There is still drought, but the drought is more local and periodic (total rain over the whole year is still increasing). Once we have lake fills up then we should now be immune to drought. Climate change is actually bringing a lot more rain to our part of the country. 

The US has crazy weather compared to Europe. Like even before climate change started we always had hurricanes, tornados, flash floods, droughts, ice storms, horrible thunderstorms going back hundreds of years. Climate change is making it even more erratic and unpredictable, but the only thing that really matters for us is how much water we have. As long as we have enough water then we can produce as much food as possible so should be ok. 

When climate change causes it to stop raining in Africa, that water doesn't disappear, it just goes somewhere else. So it's actually kind of helpful to us where we live that total rainfall is increasing in that sense. As long as you have water you can grow our crops here in any amount of heat. 


&gt;but DOP/IGP can dump at least a 15% (..at least!) on retail prices (I..mean, I'll never ever pay more for a Parmigiano/Grana/Mozzarella made in Houston/NJ/NY or whatever... and I guess same goes for 500M Europeans, same goes for scotch, fromage etc...) even if are Italians that made it...but, in the US (as you said, for you are ""generic"" or ""style"") ...

yeah, the problem is that we don't have many domestic DOP/IGPs. If we did, then we would negotiate with Europe and we would agree to recognize theirs if they recognized ours, quid pro quo. But since we don't have any we have no reason to recognize Europe's unless Europe gives us something else in trade negotiations. You can only have DOP/IGPs in places like Europe where people have been living many many years and developed their own regional styles. We only immigrated like 300 years ago so we never had time to develop individual food styles in each region. 


&gt;On the other side, especially from you, Southerner, why don't you push yours products? Southern Comfort, creoles' cuisine, Bourbons'... why for you is ""all relative""? And, IMHO, you are the ""REAL"" deal in US...fuck California, is basically Spanish cuisine (and here, in EU, we have the OG one, basically...) and fuck East Coast NY/NJ pizza style (again...) ... after this, I'm done, and I thank you for the convo, you guys understimate yourself, you could make good marketing...

Yeah we do for Bourbon, but really only Bourbon. We do push the creole cuisine a lot, but that's not really a regional product thing. It's more like a style of cooking than a specific product that can be sold. 

We also have very strict free market laws in the US. The Federal Court system will always strike down laws or regulations that are designed to restrict commerce. (Like the single market in the EU, but way more strict). The individual states can't put many restrictions on food and goods that prevent people in other states from making and selling the same good, because that would be considered protectionism by the courts.

5091,"It's curious you would mention Niall Ferguson. 


The best history of the economic aftermath of the treaty of Versailles has to be ""Lords of Finance"", which won a Pulitzer prize in 2010. It goes over all the aspects of why the original terms of the treaty weren't realistic at all, and why the counterparties were so leniant in renegotiating it time and time again. If you had read it you would understand why the comparison to 1875 is ridiculous. A lot of armchair historians do not consider some of the more important details, for example how the reshuffle of the gold stock during/after WWI made any debt denominated in gold problematic just from a currency trading point of view. And that was not an irrelevant factor. Germany ruined their currency trying to buy foreign paper/gold in the open market. 

The reason it's interesting you bring up Niall Ferguson, is that this book, which **clearly** lays out why the terms were absolutely unrealistic, has only one quote of praise from a historian on it's back cover: Niall Ferguson.

Germany in the stupidity and arrogance of it's kaiser and general staff not only shot down any attempts at de-escalation by the russians (such as Tsar Nichola's 1 on 1 telegraph) but actively escalated the conflict into a global one (white card to austria, declaration on belgium and france, zimmerman telegraph, sinking civilian boats). Casually raping and killing neutral countries along the way. The prime of this irresponsibility (so as not to say complete mismanagement and savagery) was that instead of raising a new tax to support the war effort like every allied country did, germany borrowed money to massive extents and was planning to transfer the debt to the vanquished after the end of the war, escaping from it completely unscathed as the fighting had not been happening on their soil, or on the one they were planning to conquer, but making it so that germany could would collapse economically if not allowed victory.

This of course happened, despite the gravity of the war and the suffering that was determined to be caused in large part by the german state for the reasons above, it was determined that germany would have to pay less than the french had to pay them in 1875. That Brest Litovsk which was a much harsher peace than Versailles would not be annuled. Germany, found in 1918 was paying half as much in reparations as it was paying for it's post war military, and it found the money to increase the latter substancially in the coming year while having to pay less by quantitative easing and reconstruction funds finally made Versailles a **profitable endeavor** for Germany, which massively boosted it's capability to go to war again in 39 while preventing that of the allies, which had suffered the brunt of the damage.

For having such a history of bad credit it's completely outrageous and immoral for germany to gut the greek economy in order to pay up DB. ","All hair imperator Jupiter, first of his name",/r/europe/comments/8umqtm/on_this_day_99_years_ago_the_treaty_of_versailles/e1gvigc/,Floyddit,1530227740

5222,"To offer a full picture of the different options available to platforms under the current reform proposals, it seems important to also explain the licensing option. The text adopted by the Council can serve as an example. According to the Council text, a platform for user-generated content (UGC) can either obtain an authorization from copyright holders to offer user-uploaded content on their platforms (licensing) or take measures to prevent the availability of infringing content from the outset (filtering). Licensing is thus an alternative to filtering. A closer look at the licensing option shows, however, that it will hardly ever work in practice. To fully understand the scope of the licensing obligation that follows from the Council approach, it is necessary to consider the instructions given in the Council text:

*Member States shall provide that when an authorisation has been obtained, including via a licensing agreement, by an online content sharing service provider, this authorisation shall also cover acts of uploading by the users of the service falling within Article 3 of Directive 2001/29/EC when they are not acting on a commercial basis.*

An online platform seeking to obtain a license for UGC is thus confronted with an enormous licensing task. Even though it is unforeseeable which content users will upload, the license must encompass the whole spectrum of potential posts. While this configuration of the licensing obligation is good news for users (whose activities would fall within the scope of the license and, therefore, no longer amount to infringement), it creates a rights clearance task which platform providers can hardly ever accomplish. 

Collecting societies seem natural partners in the development of the required umbrella licensing solution. However, they would have to offer an all-embracing licensing deal covering not only protected content of their members but also content of non-members. Otherwise, the licensing exercise makes little sense. It would fail to cover all types of user uploads, as required by the Council.

Considering experiences with licensing packages offered by collecting societies, it seems safe to assume that this umbrella solution will simply be unavailable in many Member States. The experiences with mass digitization projects of archives and museums have shown clearly how difficult it is to obtain umbrella licenses that go beyond the repertoire of works which collecting societies have in their catalogues as a result of agreements with members. Arguably, collecting societies will be even more hesitant to offer an indemnification against outsider claims when it comes to UGC. In the case of orphan works, the indemnification risk appears manageable. By definition, orphan works are no longer actively exploited. For many authors, the rediscovery and digitization of their work may come as a welcome surprise. Seeing their work being made available and enjoyed again, they may avoid an overly aggressive enforcement strategy or refrain from infringement claims altogether. The UGC scenario is different. If a user-uploaded video including protected content goes viral, a copyright holder who is not a member of the collecting society that has concluded a UGC licensing deal, is less likely to be sympathetic to the unauthorized use. Instead, the prospect of damage payments may lead to an aggressive enforcement strategy that enhances the indemnification risk substantially. 

Even if a platform finds a collecting society willing to enter into a UGC agreement with the umbrella effect contemplated in the Council text, a core problem of licenses for Europe remains: the collecting society landscape is highly fragmented. The UGC deal available in one Member State is unlikely to cover more than the territory of that Member State. Pan-European licenses are the exception, not the rule. If a collecting society offers Pan-European licenses for digital use, these licenses will be confined to the specific repertoire, in respect of which the collecting society has a cross-border entitlement. A Pan-European license for UGC – covering the wide variety of works uploaded by users – is thus beyond reach.

His criticism on Article 11, meanwhile, focuses on a concern that content creators may suffer from reduced circulation. However, leaving aside that Article 11 explicitly exempts ""insubstantial parts"" (which, and this is the only thing I find worrying, is subject to interpretation by Member States), Annex 7 explicitly conveys the legislation's intent to enable rightholders to retain control over exceptions to filtering.

In tandem with this, Annex 38ca asks rightholders who *want* their content protected to supply service providers with ""the necessary and relevant data"" to enable filtering in the first place. To expect Article 11 to result in unwanted removal, a filter would have to indiscriminately target just about anything that gets uploaded, which would be way out of scope for this Directive and is, in fact, specifically argued against in Annex 7 by, to quote, ""ensuring that the use of technological measures does not prevent the enjoyment of the exceptions"".

But that interview is also about a year old. Is it possible that it is simply out of date and may not reflect his current opinions regarding the Directive as it has actually been voted on by the Council now? There have been quite a number of changes since then, after all.

Can you sum up your concerns regarding the proposed Directive in its current form? With the annexes in [the Council version](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CONSIL:ST_9134_2018_INIT&amp;from=EN), a potential burden on the rest of the internet, and internet users, is specifically called out and addressed. For example a lesser expectation towards smaller companies, up to excepting them entirely from automated filter requirement, and instead simply ask them to remove content after a rightholder has contacted them.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/8ugrow/eu_copyright_ama_we_are_professors_lionel_bently/e1go6wi/,akashisenpai,1530220743

5270,"In the event of us leaving without a deal? They could refuse but the EU will force them. There's no way EU countries will let a backdoor to their single market exist for long. I mean it would literally be the case that I, a UK citizen living in North Ireland could walk a mile and sell my potatoes to the EU, but my potatoes don't meet that standards that the EU requires for their potatoes, as a result i can produce potatoes much cheaper and undercut all the other EU potato vendors. Without a customs border you have no way of stopping my potatoes, i will soon be the potato king and you will all be forced to bask in my fibrous aura.

Likewise this could go the other way, if the UK decides that the EU potatoes are in fact dogshit and they don't want them anymore. I could just walk a mile, cross the border and hey presto i am now a UK based potato supplier. Where were those potatoes grown? I'll never tell. This would basically be a comparable situation to the Russian cheese smuggling rings, except no custom means people could do it with 0 problems.

If we do crash out we would effectively have a waiting game, either the EU or UK is going to get fed up with people smuggling goods and it will likely be the EU which means they will make Ireland put up a border. Ireland can protest all they want but the issue will just keep building and building till the EU threatens them with something serious enough that they give in. By that time Ireland will have trashed their relationships with other EU countries just as the border goes up and everyone realizes the narrative has just shifted to ""EU segregating Ireland"" and all EU officials begin getting their interns to start their cars.

5287,"As also indicated a post above, the problem is that an online platform seeking to obtain a license for user-generated content (UGC) is, as Dr. Angelopoulos rightly points out, thus confronted with an enormous licensing task. Even though it is unforeseeable which content users will upload, the license must encompass the whole spectrum of potential posts. While this configuration of the licensing obligation is good news for users (whose activities would fall within the scope of the license and, therefore, no longer amount to infringement), it creates a rights clearance task which platform providers can hardly ever accomplish. 

Collecting societies seem natural partners in the development of the required umbrella licensing solution. However, they would have to offer an all-embracing licensing deal covering not only protected content of their members but also content of non-members. Otherwise, the licensing exercise makes little sense. It would fail to cover all types of user uploads, as required by the Council.

Considering experiences with licensing packages offered by collecting societies, it seems safe to assume that this umbrella solution will simply be unavailable in many Member States. The experiences with mass digitization projects of museums and archives have shown clearly how difficult it is to obtain umbrella licenses that go beyond the repertoire of works which collecting societies have in their catalogues as a result of agreements with members. Arguably, collecting societies will be even more hesitant to offer an indemnification against outsider claims when it comes to UGC. In the case of orphan works, the indemnification risk appears manageable. By definition, orphan works are no longer actively exploited. For many authors, the rediscovery and digitization of their work may come as a welcome surprise. Seeing their work being made available and enjoyed again, they may avoid an overly aggressive enforcement strategy or refrain from infringement claims altogether. The UGC scenario is different. If a user-uploaded video including protected content goes viral, a copyright holder who is not a member of the collecting society that has concluded a UGC licensing deal, is less likely to be sympathetic to the unauthorized use. Instead, the prospect of damage payments may lead to an aggressive enforcement strategy that enhances the indemnification risk substantially. 

Even if a platform finds a collecting society willing to enter into a UGC agreement with the umbrella effect contemplated in the Council text, a core problem of licenses for Europe remains: the collecting society landscape is highly fragmented. The UGC deal available in one Member State is unlikely to cover more than the territory of that Member State. Pan-European licenses are the exception, not the rule. If a collecting society offers Pan-European licenses for digital use, these licenses will be confined to the specific repertoire, in respect of which the collecting society has a cross-border entitlement. A Pan-European license for UGC – covering the wide variety of works uploaded by users – is thus beyond reach.",AMA,/r/europe/comments/8ugrow/eu_copyright_ama_we_are_professors_lionel_bently/e1gogxr/,MSenftleben,1530220991

If marriage was so important to the stability of civilization then the UK would have collapsed once Henry VIII cut them off from the Church so he could have a divorce.

5408,"&gt;was not recognized internationally. To name few the US and the USSR considered Bessarabia a territory under Romanian occupation, not a part of Romania.

Nice attempt to disinform people. France, Great Britain, Italy and Japan, from the great powers, recognized the union internationally through the Treaty of Paris from 1920. USSR didn't recognize it because according to the russian mentality, whatever Russia occupies at some point in time, even if it has no russian majority, becomes russian territory for ever. So the soviet historiography went on with the lie that ''the  romanian boyars (later on romanian nazis) occupied the russian province of Bessarabia and the USSR just liberated it in 1940''. They could never explain what sort of ''liberation'' involves mass executions and deportations of the local population and its replacement with russian colonists.

As for the USA, who at that time wanted good relations with Russia/USSR (who conditioned this, among other things, by the lack of support for the union between Bessarabia and Romania), the union was recognized de facto later on, in 1933. Moreover, after the fall of the USSR, in 1991, the american Congress recommended the american government the following:

Kolega če si opazil so podjetja samo dobile samo subvencije če zaposlijo človeka, ki je bil na zavodu vsaj 6 mesecev in jim ni treba plačat stroškov za delavca za 1 leto, pogoj pa je da je vsaj 2 leti zaposlen. Od kod smo pa dobili te subvencije? Iz evropskih sredstev. Ne vem kako razmišljaš, vendar to ne garantira nobenem delavcu, da bo brezskrbi delu za nedoločen čas. Hkrati veliko podjetij prenese minus iz poslovanja v naslednje leto in tako ""končajo"" leto pozitivno. Torej če potegnem črto je to samo začasna rešitev, ne pa dolgoročna. No če rečeš da je to dobro pol okej. Preden sem začel delat v s.p.-ju sem mislil ""eh sej podjetjem ne gre slabo"", zdej pa vidim kako hudo te država limitira pri vseh možnih investicijah. Če si v Avstriji, ti država da denar da odpreš podjetje, tukaj pa dobiš v prvih 3 letih vse mogoče inšpekcije. Zdaj mislijo še obdavčiti malico in potne stroške. Je to dobra atmosfera?

Kar se tiče črnega trga sem pa delu za podjetje ki je izkoriščalo vse po vrsti, plačan bil na črno in pol je zaprl podjetje kot da nič ni bilo. Pogodbo sva imela spisano, sam oddal je pa ni. Smešno. In ja nisem jaz tukaj edini.

DDV je 22&amp;#37; ... država ima izjemno veliko profita, podjetja ki pa niso supermarketi pa niti ne. Nelojalne konkurence, ki delajo na črno je veliko. Če delaš vse po papirjih dobi država ogromno ti pa mogoče za 1 dobro plačo (če sta že dva zaposlena je to absolutn kurac).

5&amp;#37; bdp - torej uvoz/izvoz večino se nam je povečal. Tukaj nimam nič proti. Kar se tiče domače porabe imam jaz izkušnje da je to korelacija z zaslužkom. Več ljudi pride kupit, če ne misli šparat ali si privoščiti potovanja.

5420,"No, you haven't explained anything.

You simply keep parroting point a) of paragraph 5, pretending there's no point b) and c) - that you somehow never cite- and other factors to be considered.

The directive explicitly states that to decide if a service is liable under Article 13, several factors should be considered, namely:

* size of the company within the meaning of Title I of the Annex to Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC - which defines micro-enterprises as those having less than 10 employees AND a balance sheet under 2 million and small enterprises as having less than 25 employees AND a balance sheet under 5 million. 

* audience

* uploads

* other factors (that remain unnamed)


You keep parroting the first point over and over while refusing to address the point that even a micro enterprise will be liable as long as it meets other factors, like an undetermined number of uploads or ""other factors"" - basically whatever the regulator wants to come up with.

At this point, it's evident you know perfewhich suggests you're intentionally spreading misinformation in bad faith and not merely confused yourself.

Look at that fact as an opportunity instead of a threat, and things change rapidly. Embrace a business model that isn't hurt, but rather helped, by frequent sharing and copying, and you'll prosper in the internet era.

Really, the trick is to recognize what market you are in. What can you provide that is scarce, even in the internet world? Clearly, news in general is not scarce. Entertainment is not scarce. Copies of articles is not scarce. What is scarce is for example trust - by establishing trust Wikileaks have been able to get a lot of readers to donate and NY Times continually increase their subscriber base - or reporting in a niche, having good reporting, personalized reporting, etc.

""Dad, why are those men holding hands?"" - ""Because they really love each other."" and that's it. That is why they're holding hands, it's just the truth.

That explains it perfectly well in my opinion. There's no point in making it more complicated than when a man and a woman hold hands. It's the exact same reasoning. I don't see how it's harder to explain than a heterosexual couple holding hands. If your child asks about a heterosexual couple holding hands, it's not like you go into all sorts of sexual details, sexual positions and stuff to explain it, so why would it require anything like that to explain a homosexual couple holding hands? 

I can understand that changing laws and stuff takes time, but I just don't get the reasoning behind the mentality of the people. Why do they care? It's such an irrelevant issue to me that I just don't give a shit. If they want to get married, fine, why would I give a shit?

Then shortly afterwards the first sexual assaults and other violent crimes began.

England and Ireland had the same king, then the Scottish king inherited the English (and therefore Irish) thrones.

Queen Anne then unified the crowns. The Articles of Union originally called the new state ""the united Kingdom of Great-Britain"", consisting only of the Major isle. Throughout the document, the state was referred to as ""the/this united Kingdom."" Due to the small 'u', I think it was supposed to be called the ""Kingdom of Great-Britain."" I think most people called the country ""Great-Britain"" at this point.

It got more complicated when we unified with Ireland. The new state needed a short name. We couldn't call it Great-Britain any longer, so the name United Kingdom replaced it when referring to the whole country.

5581,"I’ll focus on questions 1-4. (edit: apologies Martin, I hadn't seen that you had already addressed these points!)

&gt; Will Memes be banned? Are they illegal now? Are memes copyright infringement?

Most memes use photos. Photographic works may be protected by copyright, but only if they are sufficiently original, i.e. they amount to the author’s own intellectual creation, reflecting their personality. The CJEU in Painer has stated that a portrait photograph may amount to an original work. The photographer might imbue the work with their personality in a number of different ways, e.g. by choosing the background, the subject’s pose and the lighting, by choosing the framing, the angle of view and the atmosphere created and by choosing the developing techniques.

In some Member States additional protection also exists for non-original photographic works.

Memes may also constitute stills taken from films. In this case, the pertinent question will be whether the still represents a substantial part of the whole work. Under EU law, this will again depend on whether the part contains elements which are the expression of the intellectual creation of the author of the work. In the UK, the CDPA states in s.17(4) that ‘copying in relation to a film includes making a photograph of the whole or any substantial part of any image forming part of the film’. This would indicate that stills taken from the film do in fact amount to copyright infringement.

On this basis, making the copy will – in principle – infringe copyright, as well posting it online. 

Of course, it is always possible for a defendant in a copyright case to attempt to rely on a defence. Defences are only partly harmonised in the EU. Art. 5 InfoSoc Directive introduces a closed list of possible defences that Member States may adopt. In the UK, for example, it would be possible to argue that a meme amounts to a parody under s. 30A CDPA. It could also be said to be criticism or review under s. 30(1) – that will only succeed however if the criticism is of the copyright protected work. Finally, it is possible to argue that the meme should be protected as a permissible quotation under s. 30(1ZA). For this, it will be necessary to show either that sufficient acknowledge of the work and its author has been given (which is not the case for most memes) or that such acknowledgement is impossible. 

The best option would be to rely on parody. Having said that, it is important to remember that not all Member States have introduced a parody exception.

As for whether memes will be banned, the substantive law as I have just described it will not change. What will change will be that now platforms will have an obligation to prevent copyright infringement by end-users. To do this, they will have to adopt filtering technology. The filtering technology cannot correctly understand when a copy is a parody and when it is not. So it will take all copies down. It will then be left to the poster to fight against the take-down by using complaints and redress mechanisms. 

&gt; The anti-copyright campaigners are saying that article 13 will produce a censorship machine. Then the pro-copyright campaigners say that there is no censorship that'll be made, that memes will not be illegal, that there will be no content filtering. What's the deal here? Who is right? Will there be filtering or will there not be filtering? Will article 13 censor users? Will it make mandatory filtering a real thing?

I think my answer above goes a long way to answering this question as well. The law will not change with regard to whether or not memes will be legal. It will just be the obligations of platforms that will change. 

Theoretically platforms could also abide by their new obligations to take down infringement by e.g. checking all works posted on their platforms manually. However, platforms that handle high volumes of content will obviously not be able to do this. They will therefore turn to filtering software.

The disagreement arises from the following circumstance: the law simply imposes an obligation to prevent copyright infringement on the platform. It mentions ‘content recognition technologies’ (i.e. filtering or ‘censorship machines’) as an example of how this obligation could be fulfilled, but does not explicitly mandate them. In practice however, there is no other way to abide by the obligation. 

It is also worth noting that the fact that the proposal is pushing for filters is even admitted by the proponents of the proposal, at least when they have their guard down. See e.g. this tweet by [MEP Cavada]( https://twitter.com/JeanMarieCAVADA/status/1009476279400267778).

&gt; Will article 13 affect user's rights, human rights and feedom of expression somehow? Why? And how?

Yes, it will. This has been made clear by the case law of the CJEU. In two cases, [*SABAM v Scarlet*](http://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?language=en&amp;num=C-70/10) and [*SABAM v Netlog*](http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf;jsessionid=9ea7d2dc30ddf9c660c0ed0547259e18dee849c1d8d5.e34KaxiLc3qMb40Rch0SaxyOa390?text=&amp;docid=119512&amp;pageIndex=0&amp;doclang=en&amp;mode=lst&amp;dir=&amp;occ=first&amp;part=1&amp;cid=660728), the CJEU has already declared that imposing obligations to filter on intermediaries would interfere with the freedom of expression of end-users and their right to the protection of their personal data. This is because filters cannot ensure that protected content such as parodies are not taken down and because filtering requires the identification, systematic analysis and processing of information connected with the profiles of users. This amounts to protected personal data because, in principle, it allows those users to be identified.

David Keye, the UN Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression has also expressed his concerns [here](https://t.co/KXpbHuy7Tj).

&gt; Will article 13 affect platforms such as reddit? Twitter? Youtube? Some people say it'll not affect reddit, but some say it will. 

Probably. I try to answer this question [here]( https://old.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/8ugrow/eu_copyright_ama_we_are_professors_lionel_bently/e1fphc9/?st=jiyovngw&amp;sh=2bf051bd).

I had a teacher who was like this.

Now you need to worry about layoffs, you need to continue your education even at work, you shop in big supermarkets where most of the food isn't local, your kids need college to have a good job, they have kids/marry later so you wait longer for grandchildren.

Back then it was more simple. Everyone was more average since cars, tv, gramophone desks were a luxury that was either unobtainable or you needed to wait a couple of years.

5607,"Laws are always open to interpretation because they are written in general terms and principles, which means that they will never perfectly fit a real situation. This is even more true when you are talking about EU law (which function on the basis of compromises) and a piece of legislation dealing with internet, which has so many different types of services and content that need to ""united"" under a single law. But that doesn't mean that the law is bad or unapplicable.

On reddit and the scope : in my opinion reddit is not covered by Article 13, because its main purpose isn't to provide direct access to protected content (you don't normally use reddit to watch a movie or listen music, but to discuss). For all intent and purposes, reddit is a forum. Furthermore it doesn't optimise the content (you don't have recommandation of content or playlists of threads). To be legally more precise, reddit is (and will remain) an information society service, but it doesn't fulfill the conditions to be considered as an online content sharing service, which are the ones subjected to Article 13.

On the second part, in practice Member States will replicate the Directive and adapt it according to their own quotation exceptions and other relevant pieces of legislation.

5636,"To add to what Prof. Bently said, it is worth noting that the term of copyright protection was harmonised in the EU with the adoption of the [Term Directive](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32006L0116&amp;from=EN) in 1993. Prior to that, different countries in the EU set different terms of protection, ranging from 50 years after the death of the author to 70 years after the death of the author. To ensure that a harmonised term would apply across the EU, the EU legislator at the time opted to harmonise upwards, settling on the longer term of 70 years. This is because you cannot take away rights once these have already been granted. This would mean that, had a shorter term been opted for, transitional provisions would have had to have been introduced to respect the acquired rights of copyright holders in those Member States where they enjoyed a longer term of protection. This would postpone harmonisation of the term of protection by (in the most extreme cases) 70 years to the year 2065, which was deemed unsatisfactory.

What exactly is so hard to understand about this? 

Here's an article I just read a while ago about the GDPR:

https://digiday.com/media/everyone-breaking-law-right-now-gdpr-compliance-efforts-falling-short/


&gt;Part of the issue, experts say, is the vague regulation has been interpreted in wildly different ways.

You can't really understand why talking about a ""large amount"", without defining what a large amount is, can be interpreted in different ways?

Then you can't. I don't think anyone can help you with that. 

&gt;The law proposal says that each case should be treated individually and not in an ""ad hoc"" manner as you claimed.

Imagine believing that ""treated individually"" means ""not ad hoc"".

&gt;So, when do I become subject to Article 13?

5653,"&gt; Yes. They do provide access to copyrighted content.

You're ignoring the core of my argument. Is it reddit's *main purpose*?

[edit] [This](https://old.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/8ugrow/eu_copyright_ama_we_are_professors_lionel_bently/e1fpy09/) negotiator seems to agree with my interpretation, too. I'd be curious to witness a dialogue between the two of you, as I'm sure each of you would be more qualified to debate the intricacies of this legislative than I am.

&gt; If the secondary publisher is in favour of article 11 and will pursue it, then their work will get less distribution, thus minimizing the effects of their work and the exposure of their work. That's the concern.

I see. So the problem is essentially this secondary publisher, which would be a for-profit enterprise?

This would mean it'd come down to how much copyrighted content gets featured. However, in absence of this Directive your explanation also makes the current situation seem like a huge loophole, in that any copyrighted content can be replicated without having the rights to do so. You don't consider that a problem?

&gt; This is wrong on all levels, I'm sorry. They will not be obliged to have any licensing agreements based on article 13, because they are not an online content sharing service provider, but a press publishers. Article 13 does not affect them at all. They will be able to quote others, but their worries are if others will be able to quote them.

From the site you linked: ""Our reporting requires transparency and regularly citing sources, which means being able to link to and quote published facts as needed.""

This is a *direct quote* from their website, hence my feeling that there is a bit of a disconnect between the OCCRP and you.

Their other worries are based on sharing service providers being required to acquire a license to feature their content. Where exactly is the problem in simply granting it?

5732,"&gt;All I know is that there are many industries in the UK which are buoyed by tariffs, and if those were to become disrupted, they represent a significant part of the economy. Incorporate the multiplier effects and it appears to result in A Very Bad Thing.

There are industries that are helped by tariffs and others where tariffs are purely an input cost. The question would likely be one of displacement, and in some instances UK companies wouldn't be able to compete with foreign ones. In other areas though, the reduction in the cost of inputs would make them better able to compete. We'd essentially see another large shift as we saw when the UK joined the EU.

But again, a very large proportion of the UK economy (like most developed economies..) is services that aren't easily moved (think hair dressers, plumbers, builders etc..) and where tariffs don't change the viability of their businesses (and reductions in tariffs might make their business marginally more profitable). For many of the rest, tariff reductions would be a mixed bag, with some winners and some losers.

The recent steel tariff issue highlights that to a very large degree. Essentially the UK benefits more in terms of employment, production and exports if it has access to cheap steel. Even UK steel exports benefit from that to some extent (because the UK does have a slew of firms producing specialised materials and advanced metallurgy that very few countries do well), making a lot of cheap steel hasn't really been a thing for the UK for a while and the capacity has been relatively small (as have exports.).  

&gt;Just for the sake of conversation, care to make a guess at the impact?

Ha, no.  The problem is the complexity, I'd suggest the range would be 'mildly positive' to 'mildly negative', it'd depend heavily on how UK industry configured itself around it, and how our trading partners responded.  You'd likely find that there would be losses but there would also be offsets. Short term it'd likely mean a boost in FDI and domestic investment, consumer prices would fall in some areas (which again, might lead to increased consumption..). There would be casualties too though, although there is an element of having been in the EU mitigating that quite a bit (the UK lost a lot of industry being in the EU because of the lack of barriers, and the UK governments disinterest in propping up industry, compared to say the German approach).

Essentially unilaterally dropping all tariffs wouldn't be catastrophic, it'd be a bit stupid, and I think the UK would lose more than it'd gain, and politically it'd be a killer, but hey.  If you want catastrophic, I suppose you could suggest dropping a large proportion of NTB's, that really would be a killer, and in more ways that one..",,/r/europe/comments/8ugu7w/uk_told_little_time_left_for_brexit_deal/e1fktb1/,ajehals,1530184345

Which is exactly what is happening. Theresa May &amp; co sure do talk the talk but so far we've seen nothing from their end actually preparing a ""no deal"" scenario that they keep threatening, as if anybody was scared on the continent.

The UK simply doesnt have the infrastructure to fuction properly without the EU and it is currently doing nothing to cope with that. UK's best port is ranking 11th in Europe, half of UK-rest of the world outside EU trade are done by The Netherlands in Rotterdam. Half of your food comes via Calais.

But rest assured that IF Theresa May is stupid enough to crash exit the UK without paying the 50 Billions bills, you will get that nightmare scenario. No deal, no agreements on anything, period.

What the fuck? I never said the EU will embargo the UK but I might have said that the UK would de facto put itself on embargo if it doesnt abide to internationnals treaties and commitments.

5764,"No, just no. Maybe the communists ""showed"" they cared about education. But I was in the school system after the communist era. The schools were horribly underfunded. Ageing equipment that my grandfather probably used in schools. A lot of communist teachers were ultra shitty. Most were undereducated because they didn't keep up to date with the latest info. School cafeterias were being closed really frequently because the communist era equipment and standards were a health hazard by todays standards. Like in the city I'm living in now they tried to repair twice before saying fuck it and they just rebuild it with EU funds. 

Maybe it was nice that some people weren't homeless because they would be forced into working and just doing even a meaningless job. But let's not kid our selfs.

&gt; [edit] Also, I kinda forgot to mention something about the nature of reddit that, frankly, embarassingly just slipped my mind from the earlier point I was trying to make. Whilst it is true that reddit is a for-profit platform, would you truly argue that its main purpose is &gt; to make profit off copyrighted content? I'd argue that this is more of a side-effect from being a platform that allows users to post all sorts of stuff. I'd think reddit is less an aggregator and more of a social exchange platform.

Yes, they would be covered. 

Here are the definitions:

&gt; (4a) ‘online content sharing service provider’ means a provider of an information society service  one of the main purposes of which is to store and give access to the public to copyright protected works or other protected subject-matter uploaded by its users, which the service optimises. 
Services acting in a non-commercial purpose capacity such as online encyclopaedia,  and providers of online services where the content is uploaded with the authorisation of all concerned rightholders, such as educational or scientific repositories, should not be considered online content sharing service providers within the meaning of this Directive. Providers of cloud services for individual use which do not provide direct access to the public, open source software developing platforms, and online market places whose main activity is online retail of physical goods, should not be considered online content sharing service providers within the meaning of this Directive.

(4b) ‘information society service’ means a service within the meaning of Article 1(1)(b) of Directive (EU) 2015/1535 of the European Parliament and of the Council 1.

Bu all means they are **online content sharing service provider’ means a provider of an information society service  one of the main purposes of which is to store and give access to the public to copyright protected works or other protected subject-matter uploaded by its users, which the service optimises. **

The defining factor of the services that are covered isn't their profitability or if they profit of copyrighted content. If they are a 'internet society service provider' that is more narrowly defined to fulfill the criteria of ‘online content sharing service provider’, then they'll be covered. If they are a not-for profit (which is a legal status of a company or an organization) that fulfills the criteria of being an educational repository or an online encylopedia, or alternatively a online sales platform or a open-source code sharing service, then you're not excempted. The definition is intentionally carved out like that and it's intention is definitely to cover services such as reddit. 

Also, I am not misunderstanding the meaning of the OCCRP position. I gave them an expert opinion on that letter when they were writing it, so I am pretty sure that my understanding of their stance is correct.

5797,"&gt;Using GDP to measure the standard of living  of living has three errors. First, it doesn't count unpaid work. That  includes critical components like in-home child or elder care, volunteer  activities, and housework. Many activities that are included in GDP  couldn't occur if there weren't these support activities.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Second, it doesn't measure pollution, safety, and health. That means  the government may encourage an industry that spews chemicals as part of  its manufacturing process. The elected officials only see the jobs  created. The cost may not come to roost until decades later.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Third, the GDP per capita measurement assumes that production, and  its rewards, are divided equally among everyone. It ignores income  inequality. That means it can report a high standard of living for a  country where only a few enjoy it.

&gt;src: [https://www.thebalance.com/standard-of-living-3305758](https://www.thebalance.com/standard-of-living-3305758)

To add on the above, GDP is basically total outputs of goods and services.

5832,"&gt;That analogy is laughably bad. We're talking about a nation here, not some individual person that is an outlier. It would be more like going to a Chinese canton and noticing how everyone is as tall as the Dutch. Then saying ""Chinese people can be as tall as the dutch"" isn't an ""anecdotal quip"" anymore, it's reality, you dumbass. Unless you are so stupid as to believe that by mere chance all the tall Chinese people congregated in a single region, like believing all the ""genetically smart high IQ Africans"" somehow all congregated in Botswana so it's a genetic outlier. Absolutely retarded.

Your ignorance is on display here. A canton full of Chinese people is a canton full of Chinese people. One would not expect high genetic variance in one canton to another, in the same way that one would not expect high variance between Rome and Venice. However, there is often large variance between ethnicities within *different nations* -- or even the same nation, as we see with the Hutu and the Tutsi. To suggest a Bantu is the same as a Pygmy because they're both kind of black, is to flaunt your lack of understanding in regards to these topics. 

But leaving all that aside: the average IQ in Botswana is 70, and their [HDI is incredibly low despite their wealth.](http://hdr.undp.org/en/composite/HDI) HDI measures all aspects of life in a nation, not merely ""GDP."" The fact that you thought GDP a sufficient argument is rather concerning. Botswana is the world's largest producer of diamonds. Does that make it an advanced nation? Of course not. Anymore than Saudi Arabia's oil money has made it ""just like Europe."" Any nation can pull in loads of money if they happen to sit on a valuable resource. But what they do with that money in order to develop themselves is far more telling. Good try. 

&gt;Since you brought up the shitty height analogy, maybe you could look up height differences between North Koreans and South Koreans. Genetically identical, yet SK has a way higher average.

Because North Koreans are malnourished. You're not breaking any new ground here. The fact that environment can impact a trait, does not mean all groups share the same genetic potential. And we can easily test that potential by placing groups in the same environment via things like adoption studies. And we have. And no, blacks do not magically match the average of whites. 

&gt;What evidence mate? All you have are some poorly linked correlations. You assume their low IQ is the cause and you assume the cause for their low IQ is genetic. It's nothing but assumptions based on poorly thought out correlations.

This has all been tested for. 

&gt;The task force set up by the American Psychological Association to report on ‘Intelligence: knowns and unknowns’ cited the degree of genetic variance for IQ estimated from adoption (as well as from twin) studies as a ""definite known.""[Neisser et al.,1995]

&gt;The British Nuffield Council on Bioethics, reporting evidence  from  several  contributors, says  that  ""Adoption  studies provide a powerful means of examining genetic and environmental influences"" and that ""adoption studies have added to evidence from studies of twins in demonstrating a genetic contribution to variation"" in IQ [Nuffield Council on Bioethics, 2002]

&gt;In a review of behaviour genetic interpretations of IQ data, Maccoby concludes that adoption studies have made a high heritability for IQ ‘undeniable’. [Maccoby 2001]

&gt;Rutter declared that ""any dispassionate reading of the evidence leads to the inescapable conclusion that genetic factors play a substantial role in the origins of differences in all psychological traits."" [Rutter 2002]*

&gt;In a more recent review Turkheimer [2005] says that the  results  of  adoption  and  other  family  studies  ‘are  no  longer  in  serious  dispute’ (p. 161).

&gt;Accordingly, the substantial additive genetic variance usually inferred has provided grounds for conducting molecular-level searches for single gene components of that variance [e.g., Plomin &amp; Spinath, 2004].

As if that's not simple enough, perhaps just look at the most up to date survey of intelligence researchers:

[""Around 90% of experts believed that genes had at least some influence on cross-national differences in cognitive ability.""](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00399/full)

&gt;Meanwhile, I provided an example of an African nation that is Eastern Europe levels of successful.

Once again: do not mistake GDP for ""success."" It's a good way to embarrass yourself. 

&gt;Now tell me. If genetics would be the cause, then how can this happen?

1) Eastern Europeans and western Europeans are very distinct phenotypes. Which is why people say ""western civilization,"" rather than ""European civilization."" 2) As stated already, this is not one single African Phenotype. Comparing the most successful African nation you can find to the least successful European one is, well, I shouldn't even have to explain why that sort of gives the game away. 3) You did not account for HDI and therefore this whole point is rendered meaningless. 

&gt;What this proves to a logical, rational person, is that the cause must be something else than genetics, since people in Botswana are just as African as their neighbors. 

The fact that you would even utter a phrase as ridiculous as ""just as African as their neighbors"" pretty much sums up this conversation. Do you even understand what phenotypes are? Do you understand how distinct your average Khoi is compared to your average Arab? This is like saying because a French Canadian and Inuit are found on the same continent, they must be the same genetically. Good lord. And once more: do you understand that the ""amazing example"" you're using is a people with an average IQ of 70, whose claim to fame is selling lots of diamonds and using to the money to achieve nothing? Well done. 

&gt;You're so entrenched in your poor thought out beliefs that you can't see how absolutely lacking your reasoning is

Yes, my reasoning, based upon a hundred years of research, evolutionary biology, behavioral psychology, and with the support of the majority of experts in this field, is nothing compared to your reasoning, in which some randomly picked African outlier is ""proof"" that none of the stuff I mentioned even matters. Never mind the fact that even your ""exception"" turned out to be a total dud...

reason for growth of anti-semitism was in a way similar to modern day push back against migrants and economical problems they create, from wikipedia:

""An ever-increasing proportion of Jews in interwar Poland lived separate lives from the Polish majority. In 1921, 74.2% of Polish Jews listed Yiddish or Hebrew as their native language; the number rose to 87% by 1931, contributing to growing tensions between Jews and Poles. Jews were often not identified as Polish nationals, a problem caused not only by the reversal of assimilation shown in national censuses between 1921 and 1931, but also by the influx of Russian Jews escaping persecution—especially in Ukraine, where up to 2,000 pogroms took place during the Civil War, an estimated 30,000 Jews were massacred directly, and a total of 150,000 died. A large number of Russian Jews emigrated to Poland, as they were entitled by the Peace treaty of Riga to choose the country they preferred. Several hundred thousand refugees joined the already numerous Jewish minority of the Polish Second Republic. The resulting economic instability...""

5872,"&gt;How would Soudan produce cheaper potatoes for the british market than super efficient dutch farm that is also much closer? 

Cheaper labour and potentially lower tariffs, although it'd likely be China or India (some of the major potato producing countries..) or simply mean that UK production increases as any tariff barriers make domestic production somewhat more competitive.

&gt;Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed. The day after last december's agreement, BoJo went to the british medias bragging that it was all bollocks and The UK was bound to nothing, which ofc infuriated Brussels.

The UK has already made clear, what the situation for EU citizens in the UK will be. There is no requirement for an EU/UK agreement on that. The issue then will be what happens to UK citizens in the EU, not EU citizens in the UK. Although apparently there has been no statement to suggest that the UK arrangement would apply if there was no UK/EU deal, it's unlikely that it'd be dropped.

&gt;They've sure did make a lot of noise about a ""non-issue"". The UK brags to be one of the best spying nation in the world and as it is half the world will have a better tracking system than they will.

The UK is exceptionally good at intelligence collection, it has far deeper partnerships with non-EU partners than most EU partners in that area too. The lack of access to Galileo has little to do with that though. It's mostly about control, the US had (but no longer has apparently..) ' Selective Availability' for it's GPS system, so it could turn it off, that was obviously a bit of a problem for countries that didn't want to rely on the US. Accuracy wise, there isn't that much difference in the recent upgraded sets. The marginal difference is accuracy in polar areas. It's not a massively vital issue, but it's an important one to the UK because they have invested quite a bit of money in Galileo and the very significant UK space industry was a major player.  I'd assume that the UK would either simply continue with GPS (all of the UK kit is compatible with both after all) or put together their own programme and compete with Galileo on the commercial side.",,/r/europe/comments/8ugu7w/uk_told_little_time_left_for_brexit_deal/e1fhjne/,ajehals,1530177567

What is your evidence that punishing people for copying and sharing information is contributing positively to human society in the long term? Please provide citations.

How do you justify the existence of copyrights/IP legislation? How is it justified to create artificial scarcity of unlimited goods? What is your evidence that artificially monopolizing the right to copy and share information is of long term benefit to human society? Please provide citations.

What's your argument against the total abandonment of all other restrictive copyright/IP legislation and universal substitution with open content approaches and what is your evidence to support said argument? Please provide citations.

How do you respond to the claim that major economic progress of developing nations (for example [Germany](http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/no-copyright-law-the-real-reason-for-germany-s-industrial-expansion-a-710976.html) or [China](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-u-s-intellectual-property/china-uncovers-almost-1600-u-s-related-intellectual-property-infringements-this-year-idUSKBN1D90A0) or the [US](https://foreignpolicy.com/2012/12/06/we-were-pirates-too/)) is usually built on blatant ""theft"" of intellectual property and therefore should be encouraged.

What do you have to say in response to the accusation that all international copyright/IP legislation is nothing but a form of anti-competitive behaviour by stronger nations to propagate their imperialist ambitions? The evidence seems to show that copyright/IP only benefits the interests of the already rich and successful while inhibiting progress and innovation of new/weaker players.

How do you respond to the argument that IP legislation has become obsolete, which is evidenced by the blatant failure of legislation to prevent ""theft"" through ""piracy"" to begin with? How do you respond to the argument that there don't seem to be any actual negative effects arising from the ""theft""? How do you respond to the accusation that the therefore meaningless restriction of freedoms and rights of the individual do nothing to actually combat any alleged ""problems"" caused by digital media piracy but undeniably hurt the civil liberties of the individual?

&gt;The real dispute, once again, is not between proponents and opponents of copyright as a whole. It is between believers and non-believers. Believers in copyright keep dreaming about building a digital simulation of a 20th-century copyright economy, based on scarcity and with distinct limits between broadcasting and unit sales. I don’t believe such a stabilization will ever occur, but I fear that this vision of copyright utopia is triggering an escalation of technology regulations running out of control and ruining civil liberties. Accepting a laissez-faire attitude regarding software development and communication infrastructure can prevent such an escalation.

Do you oppose the existence of public libraries (i.e. the free sharing of commercial information)? Do you think all public libraries should be abolished? If no, why should digital media piracy be illegal?

Do you think it's reasonable for a person planting trees to demand people to pay for the oxygen molecules produced by his tree? What if I charge $1000 per molecule?

(Please discuss that oxygen is an actually tangible and scarce product that I created while sharing digital media doesn't require any active work from the original creator and is an - for all intents and purposes - unlimited, intangible good.)

What do you have to say in response to research such as this working paper supported by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis:   
https://s3.amazonaws.com/real.stlouisfed.org/wp/2012/2012-035.pdf

How do you respond to arguments such as:   
&gt;[...] patents are very much akin to trade restrictions as they prevent the free entry of competitors in national markets, thereby reducing the growth of productive capacity and slowing down economic growth. The same way that trade restrictions were progressively reduced until reaching (almost complete) abolition, a similar (albeit, hopefully less slow) approach should be adopted to “get rid” of patents. Moreover the nature of patents as time-limited makes it relatively easy to phase them out by phasing in ever shorter patent durations. 

How do you respond to recommendations such as these:     
&gt;(1) Stop the rising tide that, since the early 1980s, is both extending the set of “things” that
can be patented and shifting the legal and judicial balance more and more in favor of patent’s holders.

&gt;(2) Because competition fosters productivity growth, anti-trust and competition policies
should be seen as a key tool to foster innovation. This is of particular relevance for high tech sectors, from
software to bioengineering, to medical products and pharmaceuticals.

&gt;(3) Free trade is a key part of competition policies hence the role that WTO-WIPO-TRIPS
play should be redefined to move away from the current neo-mercantilist approach toward free trade in
goods and ideas. The aim here should be that of stopping the policy of exporting our intellectual policy
laws towards other countries while adopting a policy of exporting free trade and competition in
innovation. This seems an urgent goal because, within a couple of decades, the “balance of trade in ideas”
between US+EU and Asia may easily reverse. At that point the temptation to engage in “mercantilism of
ideas” may well affect the now developing Asian countries, leading to a general increase in IP protection
worldwide.

&gt;(4) Cross industry variation in the importance of patents suggests we may want to start
tailoring patent’s length and breadth to different sectorial needs. Substantial empirical work needs to be
done to implement this properly, even if there already exists a vast legal literature pointing in this
direction.

&gt;(5) Reversing the burden of proof: patents should be allowed only when monopoly power is
justified by evidence about fixed costs and actual lack of appropriability. The operational model should be
that of “regulated utilities”: patents to be awarded only when strictly needed on economic grounds. This
requires reforming the USPO, which is urgently needed in any case.

&gt;(6) Prizes and competition. An interesting approach is that of operating to change the role
that the NSF and the NIH play in fostering innovation. The basic goal, in this case, is that of reversing the
principle according to which federally financed investigation can lead to private patents. As a first step we
would advocating going back to the old rule according to which the results of federally subsidized
research cannot lead to the creation of new private monopolies but should be available to all market
participants. This reform would be particularly useful for the pharmaceutical industry.

&gt;(7) With regards to the latter, we advocate reforming pharmaceutical regulation to either treat
stage II and III clinical trials as public goods (to be financed by NIH on a competitive basis) or by
allowing the commercialization (at regulated prices equal to the economic costs) of drugs that satisfy the
FDA requirements for safety even if they do not yet satisfy the current, over-demanding, requisites for
proving efficacy. It is ensuring the efficacy—not the safety—of drugs that is most expensive, timeconsuming
and difficult. All the usual mechanisms of ensuring the safety of drugs would remain firmly in
place. While pharmaceutical companies would be requested to sell new drugs at “economic cost” until
efficacy is proved, they could start selling at market prices after that. In this way, companies would face
strong incentives to conduct or fund appropriate efficacy studies where they deem the potential market for
such drugs to be large enough to bear the additional costs. At the same time this “progressive” approval
system would give cures for rare diseases the fighting chance they currently do not have. This solution
would substantially reduce the risks and cost of developing new drugs.

&gt;(8) If this progressive approval approach works for rare diseases, there is no reason is should
not be adopted across the board. The current system favors a small number of blockbuster drugs that can
be sold to millions of patients. The coming revolution in medicine will rely on carefully targeting
hundreds or even thousands of drugs to the correct patients. But lawmakers must first usher in a new
system that makes developing these precision treatments possible. The regulation reform we are
suggesting would be a first important step to achieve such goal.

&gt;**The aim of policy, in general, should be that of slowly but surely decreasing the strength of
intellectual property interventions but the final goal cannot be anything short of abolition.** Once again, if
at the times of Machlup one could still nurture doubts and wonder if the system could not be reformed in
a credible and stable form, in 2012 one must ask: **is not six decades of failure enough time? Is it not time
to take seriously the idea of patent abolition and begin the discussion of these transitional issues?**",,/r/europe/comments/8ugrow/eu_copyright_ama_we_are_professors_lionel_bently/e1fhmdb/,StalinWasNoMarxist,1530177748

5901,"&gt; Okay, this isn't the same. Nobody who is sane likes to see living creatures suffer, I personally really dislike people who hunt for sport, for instance. But you shouldn't be comparing animals killed for food to murdering people.

&gt; Despite what militant vegans and depressed misanthropes tell you, human life is (or should be) worth more to us, even if you put aside the feelings of the murdered person, a lot more people will suffer because they died.

Yes, human life should be worth more to us, I agree. If wild animals are threatening a person's life, or if pests are ruining our crops, we should get rid of them. Preferably in a manner that causes the least amount of harm, but by killing them if necessary. In any case, a human's life should always come first. Farm animals aren't threatening our lives though. We simply put them in cages and enclosures their entire lives so we can eat whatever it is they're producing, and then we kill them for food. *None of this is necessary in the developed Western world, where alternatives are readily available.* So if it is not necessary, then why do it? We'll come to the ""it's cheaper"" part later.

&gt; You're killing someone's sibling/child/parent/spouse, on the other hand the lot mates of the poultry farm chicken you slaughter won't notice or care that their buddy is gone.

&gt; We like to attribute a lot of human characteristics to animals, but they're not really there. I've had pets, loved them, cried when they died, but they weren't afraid of death in the way we are nor did they contemplate it or wonder how much time they had left, that was all me, since I was the only sentient one in the room.

I can ask you two questions about this statement.

1. If the reason we're generally not killing humans is because those humans are someone's spouse/child/sibling/family/friend, then why is it also not OK to kill a bitter old man who is liked by nobody and who has no surviving relatives? What is the difference between an animal nobody personally cares about, and a human nobody personally cares about?
2. Why does the animal's cognitive ability to understand its situation matter? What is the difference between that animal and a severely mentally disabled person? They have the same cognitive ability. Both have the same primal understanding about the concept of death, and neither wonders about their personal situation or the amount of time they have left to live. So then what difference between the two makes it OK to kill one but not the other?

&gt; Typically, the same people who do the things mentioned in the article will rail against the evils of [the previously mentioned] imperialism and adopt their nice post-colonial narratives, but then they'll obliviously feel superior and look down on people who aren't as fortunate...

Yes, some people are assholes. There are assholes in every group. But it's unfair to extend this to the all vegans or even the concept of veganism. You wouldn't even know most vegans are vegan until you had a meal with them. I don't look down on you for not adopting a vegan lifestyle, I'm merely doing my best to reply to your anti-vegan arguments in what I hope to be a respectful and logical manner. This not at all to ""convert"" you, but I'm hoping to at least make you think about veganism and perhaps temper your view on it.

&gt; ...and can't adhere to their expensive, niche diet. Meat may be fairly expensive but not more than a Vegan diet, I'm not talking about Vegetarians. Vegan diets are expensive, in a lot of developed countries, fruit and vegetables cost more than meat and dairy products or their alternatives, so if you're a low/middle income person, you're not being an evil, murderous, ethically bankrupt monster, you just need stuff to eat.

A healthy vegan diet can be the cheapest of all diets. Beans, rice, potatoes, pasta, lentils, in-season fruits and vegetables, etc... All of these are cheaper than meat and dairy products and can constitute an *almost* complete and healthy diet. The only thing a vegan can't get from plants that others get from meat is B12, so for that he would need supplements or reinforced meat/dairy replacements. Even then, still cheaper than eating dairy and meat with every meal. Of course if you're going to start including an unnecessary amount of meat and dairy replacements, or expensive exotic fruits and vegetables like avocados, then yes, the price can quickly skyrocket. The same can be said about dairy and meat: people on a budget will necessarily always get the cheaper brands and cuts of meat, while people who don't have to worry about money will eat the most expensive brands and finest cuts of meat every day. Trust me, price is not the issue, it is people's unwillingness to try. The prospect of cooking meals without meat and/or dairy understandably seems insurmountable. Luckily thanks to the internet, learning about veganism and healthy/cheap vegan diets has never been easier, if you are willing to do so.

&gt; I don't think they should be ashamed of their privilege in the same way I think it's bullshit for modern Germans to be held responsible for 20th century crimes or for modern white Americans to be blamed for slavery and repression of blacks or whatever other example you want.

&gt; But I do think they should be keenly aware that it is because of their privilege that they have the luxury of adopting this lifestyle.

As should we all, for all our privileges that come with being born in the Western world.

&gt; As for the ethics, it's debatable. As I was saying no one sane wants to see living creatures suffer, but there is a difference between ""I think animals should be treated more humanely and not stuffed by the hundreds in tiny rooms"" and ""I think animals are literally equal to us and using their milk or eggs is equal to theft"".

No vegan in his right mind is going to say that animals are literally exactly the same as humans. What they are saying is that there is no difference between animals and humans that makes it OK to treat them the way we treat farm animals. You would not willingly take the place of a farm animal, because it is not a life you would want to live. And if it is not a life you want to live, then why are you OK with the fact that we subject other creatures to that life? Especially when you know, for a fact, that it is unnecessary (for us in the developed Western world) to do so?

&gt; Ironically, like a lot of agriculture, producing the things needed to sustain vegan diets have negative effects on wild life, but all of the rhetoric is squarely concentrated on domestic animals, even though wild life is arguably more important to biodiversity. Agriculture kills a ton of critters, ask some farmers what happens when they plow their combines through a field. Not to mention that those places weren't always vast fields filled with soy, pesticides and chemical fertilizer.

Excellent point. [Did you know that 36% of worldwide crop calories are used to feed livestock?](https://www.vox.com/2014/8/21/6053187/cropland-map-food-fuel-animal-feed) Did you know that for every 100 crop calories fed to livestock, at most about 12 calories end up as food for humans in the form of animal products? So if we no longer ate meat and dairy, thus eliminating that livestock, we would require far less than that 36% of freed up crop calories to replace the lost animal product calories. By going vegan we require fewer crops, less land, and we could thus severely decrease the negative side effects of crop farming that you listed.

&gt; Other creatures lived there, they had to be driven out, because we care about human needs first, always have and always will. Is that immoral? If so, then we're all benefiting from it and are all immoral, but I don't believe that.

Specifically related to crop farming, it is immoral in the sense that we do so to an extent that is far greater than necessary to live a healthy life. Veganism isn't about being morally perfect, it is, and this is the official definition of veganism: *a way of living that seeks to exclude, as far as possible and practicable, all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing and any other purpose.* Note that it says ""as far as possible and practicable"".

&gt; Basically, someone is getting fucked either way. I certainly do think the animal husbandry industry can do a lot better, but this idea that veganism is the only ethical position is dubious at best.

Veganism isn't the only ethical position you can take but going vegan is, [factually](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/veganism-environmental-impact-planet-reduced-plant-based-diet-humans-study-a8378631.html), the most effective action you can *personally* take (besides killing yourself and not having babies, for what that information is worth in practice) to decrease your ecological impact. And it's ethical and (if done properly) healthy to boot!

&gt; Then there are the idiots that harm their carnivore pets by trying to feed them ""alternatives"", part me of wants to empathize since they think they're doing good but a louder part wants me to ask them if they're mentally ill.

This is actually a point of debate among vegans. Some would say it is OK to feed meat to your pets because they are carnivores. Others say that even that is unnecessary if you do it properly. Personally I haven't done a lot of research concerning this, because I am of the opinion that the best thing is to just not have pets at all. Not necessarily for vegan considerations, but mostly because I have loved and lost a lot of pets in my life so far, and I just can't take it anymore.

Where is the connection between ""people spending money"" and the state spending money on useless stuff, losing money to corruption and tax evasion and an overblown social welfare state?

And then he relates the debt austerity 2009-2011 to the growing debt. I cannot even fathom how he gets such an idea. The greek government was accused a thousand times in public that NONE of the austerity measures connected to the new loans in the first bailout package have been set in motion. Austerity started 2015, not 2009. The greek state was unable/refused to actually do anything it has promised to the EU 2009.

&gt; Ive just heard that the UK has to pay some money to the EU)?

The ""divorce settlement"" cost of £40 billion will not have to be paid if there is no agreement.

&gt; I mean, is it in the interest of everybody to reach a deal or will the UK be better not reaching a deal and going by default to what you described?

There are pros and cons for both sides for both outcomes. Cutting trade overnight with the UK who imports massively is not a great deal for here in Sweden or in Germany and not as bad for the UK if they take their business elsewhere. But at the same time, uncertainty is not good for markets in general and that will have immediate effects in the UK.

Unfortunately the way to lower the impact the most for both parties is non-existent. If the EU budges on some of their rules, another country will be trying the same thing tomorrow. If the EU plays hard ball (which they are doing) and the UK don't give in, then once all the gaps are filled (trade gaps, which will be filled, it is a competitive world and people will flock to a new available market), then the UK drifts closer to the other Anglosphere countries and the EU loses budget, military, scientific, educational, security council member influence.

I think the idea from the EU is to make it almost impossible to leave in the way the Brexit voters expect. So they can leave the parliament and their seats at the meetings, but not the other institutions and pillars. So I think the thinking is that if they stir up a second referendum, or get opposition in parliament to vote it a deal down to take control, or scare people about economic uncertainty then they will take a deal that keeps them firmly in the fold. Unfortunately the one thing I have learned dealing with Brits (and I say this with love) is that they are a very stubborn people, so not sure this is the best approach, but for sure I don't see the existential doom and gloom for the EU or UK out of this.",,/r/europe/comments/8ugu7w/uk_told_little_time_left_for_brexit_deal/e1fehlc/,fuckjeah,1530170766
