7,"Essentially [Tolkien's dwarves](http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Dwarf).

&gt; Dwarves were typically stubborn, secretive, and fiercely loyal to their friends. They cared greatly about mining, crafting, crafts, gold and gems, their acquisition of which often fueled the envy of the Elves. Dwarves were easily offended by rude comments, and had a propensity to hold long-lasting grudges. 

&gt; The Dwarves were some of the greatest miners ever to exist in Middle-earth. The Dwarves dug immense halls under mountains where they built their cities. Dwarven miners dug for precious minerals such as gold, iron, copper, and silver from all over mountains in Middle-earth, though the Dwarves considered coal mining degrading.

&gt;

&gt; They were also capable masons and smiths - Dwarven smithing skills were said to be rivaled only by those of the Elves, and their masonry creations were bested by none. The skill of the Dwarves was unmatched; they crafted objects of great beauty out of diamond, emerald, ruby and sapphire. Everything Dwarven was beautifully crafted and intricate.

&gt;

&gt; Dwarven armies were vast and powerful, and possessed vast legions of soldiers, cavalry and siege weapons, and their soldiers were equipped with powerful weapons, armors and tools for battle. Many different weapons were utilized by their soldiers, such as swords, axes, throwing axes, throwing knives, and warhammers.

&gt;

&gt; They had a knack for starting a fire almost anywhere out of almost anything. Although they knew how, Dwarves did not farm or herd often, as they preferred to spend their time underground mining and crafting. They rather traded crafted items with men and elves in exchange for food.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/7p0tkq/what_do_you_know_about_germany/dselug4/,-x_x_,1515476990

&gt;Maybe no one want to secede from Russia not doesn't mean a well funded propaganda campaign wont change that.

There is no way in hell any one of the Turkic, Russian, or Mongolian people are going to suddenly go full on for political Chinese anything, that's just not how it works for a large number of reasons, not to mention the presence of an entire country between them that would rather stay poor than become Chinese.

 &gt; China is already an economical powerhouse. Their quality of life has been rising at astonishing rates. And people flock to money, fuck patriotism if you got money. 

That's also not how things in China work. If you have a shit job in Russia, you are going to earn even less in China, there is really nothing out there for Russians other than cheap border shopping 

&gt; Plus China is in a dire need of farming land.

Lmao farming in Siberia, that's a good one

 &gt; Furthermore  China doesn't need to annex that land. They can get a puppet government that does as they please, and weaken Russia while their at it. 

China can't even get North Korea to be its puppet, and you think they can make a puppet out of people that have traditionally resented China to the point of joining Russia.

Voters are free to vote for anyone acording to current law which you signed in Dayton. Remember how in HZHB, NDH, Yugoslavia of either kind Bosniaks had no right to national name nevermind their representatives or quotas. You have more rights than you've ever given us.

Yeah sure, the blocking will only hurt us and not hit those with EU passports who can just leave easily for greener pastures. Your blockades have led to and 10k Croats leaving. If we hate you then that benefits us. The harder the situation in Bosnia the more likely it is that those who hate it will leave. You have dual cotizenship making leaving easy. We meanwhile have to get visas and love this country making it more difficult to leave.

Thats the deal thats fair to both of us. You're the one asking us to change a good thing for us and give you something that benefits us in no way. Ergo you have to offer something good.

117,"&gt; market is there, it is Europeans that don't really aggressively promoting themselves there unlike the Japanese or the Koreans.

I think you don't get the fundamental problem here, the shipping containers are just the outcome of that. The EU can't produce at the level of low wages that are paid in China/ASIAN countries. It's not that the EU is not trying to sell their products to China, they simply don't have bulk goods that the Asians want, because the companies that produces those goods are almost all located in China/ASIAN countries (low wages). The EU has some high end goods that are shipped to China/ASIAN but those goods are just a small share of the overall world trade. They just don't fill up the shipping contanersd that are sended back to China/ASIAN countries.

This is not a problem that is recent. For hundreds of years, European countries have had this problem (that Asian counttries/traders were not interrested in European finished goods). For example: The Dutch east india company had complicated trade routes within Asia to be able to get the goods that were shipped back to their mother lands. The Britsh east india company had to use opium asa trading good to get their hands on Chinese tee because China was not interrested in any finished British goods (causing a war). 

Because of all of these issues, I fail to see how the EU would be able to solve the problems of empty shipping containers, now or in the (near) future.",,/r/europe/comments/7p0b4n/chinas_new_silk_road_cannot_be_oneway_frances/dseg92k/,goeie-ouwe-henk,1515470368

One example: Last week a girl (15) got stabbed and killed in Kandel by a foreigner (refugee maybe) a city I live close by. The days afterwards there were people outside the mayors office ""protesting"". (Side not. Mayors not at fault in my opinion, police and Germersheim fucked up big time, but it's still not ""their fault"", hard to explain)

So to think that we are obedient and just let things happen how they come ... I don't know it's just false.

Our history is exactly why we aren't obedient and docile. We know what happend last time. And we still make sure that younger people get taught in detail how and why it happened... And how to prevent it.

Firstly, I am not Japanese.

Even a treaty doesn't guarantee that as Chinese courts are not Western courts. They can lie and get away with it.

While your complaint is valid, do realise that all successful nations do the form of list you mentioned. This includes the Japanese, Koreans and even Europeans at various point of history. Did the Chinese did it at a scale never seen before? Sure.

Countries that can't do what you list mostly fail - look at Africa and the MENA regions.

 - China has a vested interest in using exports to build up it's economy and has a long term goal of building up it's services sector and in doing so replacing the high tech goods they import from you and us.

If you are Chinese, wouldn't that be your goal as well? Which country want their countries economically dependant on foreigners, really?

- Japan does not have a trade surplus with China and China has a different foreign policy regarding it's neighbors ignoring Japan. Don't assume they'll treat you the same way.

My point is that Japan managed to do very well in China and also in the SEA. Europe, not so much.

They are heading towards a demographic crises worse than other european states, and their economy is reliant on oil and gas, which has tanked. It will continue to readily decline with increase in solar and wind. Its economy is controlled by Oligarchs loyal to Putin who steal the countries money from the population. I genuinely believe Russia will be a complete shithole by the 2030s or 2040s. Much of it is already basically a third world country, and that is going to continue to increase with declining population and economy. Not to mention increased religiosity and increased xenophobia are responsible for a russian brain drain.


USA, EU, India, China? Probably, although the US will be most powerful still. The EU or India would likely be weakest. Only China and the USA really have much influence outside their areas, and China has little at that. The USA has influence with much of Eastern and Central Europe, the mideast(Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, Israel, much of the Gulf states), east Asia(South Korea, Taiwan, and Japan), and has made some inroads to southeast asia, although China is competing still. China probably has more influence in some african countries, due to its large investments in their economies. Along with parts of Southeast asia. China has some pull in South America I believe, although the Americas are still the USA's playing ground, unless Brazil takes up more of step to become a world power, which it has the ability to do so.


The EU will not be super power, or at least, not like the US and China in anyway, if doesnt have central and eastern Europe. Poland and Hungary exiting, along with a possible formation of an eastern EU, would be a USA ally. 

I suspect the EU will have to make a choice between two regions. Eastern Europe(romania, bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania) and parts of Central europe(Poland, Hungary, and maybe Czech)(all as one region) or choosing the Nordics and more developed Northern Europe like Sweden, Finland, Denmark, and Netherlands. Britain has already left.

What I see for the EU is basically this, the EU will try to federalize and grow ever closer, but the Nordics will not accept because of the eastern and central europeans bringing the economy down(although southern europe being shitty is a factor, I dont think the Nordics would stop a federal union over them being there). This will continue until possibly Poland and Hungary leave, along with other central and eastern states, thus allowing the formation of a more federal union.

You said it yourself. He either doesn't do what they want and gets killed or toes the line and we have another Putin, but probably even worse. There's no battering ram here, at least with legal means like elections. The country doesn't have well-developed institutions for its elites to obey the president just because he is the president. The military and siloviki will work against anyone who cuts their pay, exactly what Navalny planned to do. So I'd rather have a realist who can do good within the boundaries of the system, than Navalny who would never be able to achieve anything. It's either that or a nuclear option, which is worse.

433,"1. Please forgive me my change to more direct words but my attempts to leave you a golden bridge open did not work. 

Your are using democratic institutions such as judiciary systems or constitutions as an argument while balantly ignoring obvious facts about their character. Outside of a theoretical thought concept in a University course there is no completely free/independent judiciary system. When a constitution or a judicial body is created the political forces, who put it into existance _always_ secure some sort of influence. May it by the way they structure it, my it via the choice of judges or the availabilty of financial resources.

Therefore it is no surprise that no anglo-saxon country has your completely free judicial system, nor has any continental European country. Some of them might have judiciaries that reached a high percentage of independence in this regard, but none has or ever will reach 100% of it. At least not with humans as they currently are.

2. I highly recommend you to read more about fundamental laws and their theoretical bodies/fundations in continental Europe and anglosaxon countries. It will make you understand that this is not soley the job of a civil or administrative judiciary. This because in most states it simply lacks the legal abilites to do so. 

3. When I as a citizen express my disagreement with a verdict on the base of arguments, i suddenly render myself an undemocratic person? What kind of twisted defintion of democracy do you have? Furthermore i do not intend to react to your utmost insulting claim that i would want to live in an undemocratic society.

486,"The difference between the EU institutions and the national governments is that the latter hold the power to change the former, or to introduce any meaningful political initiative. This is why I am criticising them more than the EU. It would already do wonders if e.g. the German govt. got rid of its hypocritical notion of EU solidarity, or the Polish govt. of its victim complex. This however would require an honest admittance to their respective electorates that e.g. Germany is using the EU in selfish manners or that Poland has to adhere to legally binding votes it agreed to (even under different govt.'s). 

Regarding the European electorate, I believe you misunderstand my vision. I do not believe my vision would win out because of some intrinsic ratio, but because an wide discussion would lead to the (re-)politisation of the European project. Here, I believe, there is fertile ground for a European narrative which ultimately leads to a European identity. None of this is based solely on pragmatism or idealism alone, but would spring forth from the political discourse itself and the opposing sides it creates within a European political sphere. We might even be lucky enough to experience such an awakening right now, with the left being rather unorganised but the pro-EU right forming itself around Kurz/Orban. 

Coming back to national governments, I believe it is not the EU institutions or federalists who abhor politisation but the national governments. Why? Because in every scenario, be it disintegration or federalisation, they will cease to control the EU's development. Loss of control is a nightmare for our governments, so they try to prevent it even if might strangle Europe in the process.",EU nation: /r/acteuropa,/r/europe/comments/7oxrgf/the_eu_you_want/dsdwxzq/,DFractalH,1515448946

511,"Ach Berlin. Was ist Berlin? Berlin ist die Stadt für die man sich als Deutscher auf internationaler Bühne schämen muss. Wenn man Berlin mit anderen europäischen Hauptstädten wie London, Paris, Madrid und Amsterdam vergleicht, treibt es jedem anständigen Menschen die Schamesröte ins Gesicht. Selbst kleine Länder wie Österreich, Belgien oder die Schweiz haben mit Wien, Brüssel und Zürich international vorzeigbare Städte mit hoher Lebensqualität. Deutschland ist gestraft mit Berlin, der Hauptstadt der Versager. Berlin beheimatet mit Abstand am meisten Arschlöcher in der gesamten Republik. Deutsche Bahn, Bundestag, Air Berlin und der Axel Springer Verlag sind nur einige Beispiele für den unfähigen Abschaum der hier beherbergt wird.

Glorreiche Zeit sind schon längst vorbei, diese Stadt liegt am Boden. Der Berliner an sich ist durch und durch ein fauler Lump. Charaktereigenschaften die in jedem zivilisierten Kulturkreis als pure Faulheit, Unfreundlichkeit, Unfähigkeit, dissoziale Persönlichkeitsstörung und Dummheit gelten, erklärt der Berliner kurzerhand zur Berliner Wesensart. Ein weiteres zentrales Merkmal ist der alles beherrschende Minderwertigkeitskomplex. Deswegen projiziert der Berliner auf jeden der in irgendeiner Weise besser ist als er, massive Hassgefühle. Besonders die ihm in allen Belangen haushoch überlegenen Süddeutschen sind ihm ein Dorn im Auge. Er neidet ihnen den Erfolg und München steht ganz oben auf seiner Hassliste. Diese Stadt ist alles und hat alles was der Berliner gerne wäre und hätte. Das München dem Berliner sein Lotterleben finanziert, interessiert den Berliner nicht, er glaubt sogar insgeheim er hätte es verdient. Anstatt sich aus seiner aus Neid und Missgunst entstehenden Lethargie zu befreien und seine Stadt umzukrempeln, ergeht er sich in asozialen Schmarotzertum und hält noch große Stücke auf seine vermeintliche Weltstadt.

Kulturell ist Berliner eher schwach veranlagt, große Werke liegen lang zurück. Auch gilt hier bereits das Aussprechen des Buchstaben »g« als »j« als große Kulturleistung. Fortgeschrittene beherrschen sogar das Anhängen eines »wa?« an den Ende eines jeden Satzes. Das Leistungsniveau in der Küche bewegt sich auf überschaubarem Niveau. Eine Wurst aus gemahlenem Seperatorenfleisch mit Ketchup und Currygewürz wird hier als Currywurst und als kulinarischer Geniestreich verkauft. Jeder vernünftig denkende Mensch hält eine Wurst mit Ketchup wohl kaum für den heiligen Gral der Küchenkunst und wahrscheinlich noch nicht einmal für ein Rezept. Großzügig lässt der Rest der Republik den Berliner in diesem Glauben um seine Minderwertigkeitskomplexe nicht überhand nehmen zu lassen.

Wirtschaftlich ist Berlin ein einziges Desaster, selbst die späte DDR stand solider da. Ansonsten fußt die Berliner Wirtschaft auf alternativen Blogs, irgendwas mit Medien und Genderstudies wenn man den Universitäten glauben darf. Ungeachtet des wirtschaftlichen Bankrottes leistet sich der Berliner trotzdem Prestigeprojekte wie das Stadtschloss und einen Flughafen der mangels Funktionstüchtigkeit als Kunstprojekt gelten soll. Ebenso beherbergt diese Stadt sämtliche Zentralen der Volksparteien, die aus Marketinggründen auf das »Verräter« im Namen verzichten. Bürgermeister dieser Stadt war lange der lustige Wowibär der mit seiner Prestige&amp;Prosecco Politik alles in den Abgrund riss, was noch halbwegs präsentabel war.

Kurzum: Berlin ist der Fliesentisch Deutschlands. Es ist das für Deutschland, was Griechenland für die Europäische Union ist und hätte Berlin eine offene Kloake, wäre es das Rumänien Deutschlands. Berlin ist ein Schandfleck, der Pickel am Arsche Deutschlands. Berlin ist der Typ der ohne Einladung auf deine Party kommt, noch nicht mal Alkohol mitbringt und auch nicht versteht dass er nicht erwünscht ist wenn man ihm ein paar Zähne aus dem Gesicht klopft und die Treppe runterwirft. Berlin ist das Detroit Deutschlands und gehört für 200 Złoty an Polen verkauft.

599,"Thank you for the indepth and thoughtful response. 

The problem is that in this environment, /r/europe, this ""double standard"" only gets brought up in certain contexts. It may not be arguing that it is not a problem, but because posts like these will get ""so like most of the anti immigrants stuff"" whereas others don't really the effect is damaging to the conversation. 

The reason is clear. People who don't like PiS are generally centrist and centre-left people, and they are the same people that don't like the posts about immigrants. So in a thread where they overstep and get caught up in fake news, when they get called out, they latch on to a comment like ""so like most of the anti immigrant stuff"" (which they assume people who defend PiS must agree with) to assure themselves that they are still better, more thoughtful, less biased, and less prone to falling for fake news than their enemies. Those 20 upvotes the comment I responded to has are basically 20 people who now don't have to face their demons. 

I understand what you are saying, but it's clear why immigrants were chosen in this context. It could have been some other thing where sensationalism and confirmation bias lead to people falling for fake news. Maybe something apolotical, or some other /r/europe liberal-left circlejerk. But it wasn't. It was ""immigrants"". The psychological function this serves is to allow people who uncritically fell for this story due to their confirmation bias to regain their smug sense of superiority at the expense of ""the badies"" who ""hate immigrants"".

600,"&gt; If there would be an European corporate tax wouldn't there be more money overall within the union?

Possibly. Depending on what the corporate tax would be. If the EU made itself too unattractive with its unified corporate tax, companies might flee away to other parts of the world. But even if this didn't happen, it would still cripple the economies of countries that currently stand on low corporate tax model - so you'd have more struggling economies in the EU and more need for redistribution.

&gt; If I wrote of a centralized welfare system I assumed that would be funded on a European level. 

But again, that would once again mean more and more fiscal transfers. The EU would once again take money from the richer regions and send them to the poorer regions so that Romania and Bulgaria could have just as good welfare standards as Germany or Netherlands - I'm sorry but how are you going to communicate this to Germans? 

'Dear voters, in order to have our glorious European Federation, please understand that your living standards will have to go sliightly down, because SE countries struggle with debt issues. Oh and I also forgot that we need to sendt shit tons of money to CEE too so that they can have the same welfare system as we have. Got it? Thanks'.

Now, don't get me wrong, the current setting of eurozone and the EU in general works disproportionally in Germany's advantage. If it was fairness that we should go after, then Germany should absolutely contribute more. But obviously this isn't the kind of message that will bring you votes in Germany. Germans understandably want their politicians to do what is in the interest of the Germans, not what is in the interest of other Europeans.",Czech Republic,/r/europe/comments/7oxrgf/the_eu_you_want/dsdhm7l/,kristynaZ,1515433560

602,"&gt;The former UKIP leader says meeting with the EU’s chief negotiator in Brussels was ‘civil.’ 

""Disappointingly so, in fact.  This is why I promptly went to the press to release as much uncivil material as possible.""

&gt;“Mr. Barnier clearly did not understand why Brexit happened. I left with the impression that it has not been previously explained to him that the Brexit vote was primarily about controlling mass immigration and democratic self-determination,” Farage said in an official statement after the meeting…

-

&gt;He said he had “had enough” with the state of Brexit talks and wanted to “speak for the 17.4 million who did not vote for a transition deal or any further delays.”

I really wonder how much of that is political rhetoric and how much he truly believes.  Even for Farage, having no transition period — not even the already-quite-short 24 months — and being fifteen months away from Brexit without a clear deal in place has *got* to sound somewhat ballsy.  Could the UK do it?  Yes.  Would it be more-disruptive and costly?  Probably.  If you're Toyota, you'd probably like to know on what terms you can get materials, labor, and have access to customers with some time to make changes.

Obviously, the British government must be *willing* to walk away with a no-deal if need be: she should not accept an arrangement worse than no deal.  But advocating for no transition period without even knowing what the deal is yet seems like getting rather ahead of himself.

Even if the UK has secretly lined up fantastic deals with, I dunno, India, the US, Canada, and China, she sure can't transition to a different set of suppliers and customers overnight, and she'd sure like to do business with the EU in addition to that.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/7oyggu/michel_barnier_uncomprehending_on_brexit_says/dsdhn28/,vokegaf,1515433583

605,"I can see why you'd think that, but in my opinion I think the greater problem is that as people who come in will not assimilate based on their own decisions, values, and attitudes, treating them and/or their children as legally identical to established Spaniards is only going to cause internal turmoil and increased conflict. Beyond having a homeland for Spanish peoples (including all the Spanish nationalities), I think that having a country with a shared sense of identity is critical. By accepting large numbers of immigrants who are neither willing to assimilate nor really whom ought to be obliged to do so, we are causing the problems to exist or at least to be exacerbated. Simply trying to solve that problem by legally ignoring it and calling everyone 'Spanish' doesn't solve the underling conflict of identity in the country and among immigrants. Indeed it may only cause those who identify on as Spanish to feel disillusioned or conflicted, and to feel as if though something of theirs (their homeland) is being threatened. And that's not a good thing to have happen. Regardless of what your ideals may be (and ours may differ), I think practically speaking there needs to be some legal distinction between incoming immigrants and those in the country, for simply calling everyone Spanish cannot bridge the gap in identity that exists all on its own.",Spain,/r/europe/comments/7oz1j4/chiñol_the_dilemma_of_being_secondgeneration/dsdhooi/,AidenTai,1515433628

You are right when you say everyone has a background, culture, language and ethnic history of their own... with emphasis on **their own**. It is not for you or me to decide that Quan Zhou or Susana Ye are culturally Chinese, and refusing to accept them as Spaniards is to forget, ignore, or erase their own life experiences, identities and preferences.

If they feel a strong connection with the Chinese culture and language that's brilliant and it is their own decision to make, but they were brought up in Spain, went to Spanish schools, speak native Spanish, are culturally Spanish and identify as Spaniards. That's the whole point of the article.

Different countries fill different nieches. For example, our education system allows our student to be one of the best IT workers in the world. Polish schools focus much more for example on mechanical engineering or informatics, but Greeks schools should focus on... I don't know, food processing, tourism or foreign languages.

There are countries in Europe whose huge competitive advantage is favourable corporate tax. Ireland, Hungary or Netherlands are one of those. If you take it away from them, they are gonna run into big issues.

A centralized welfare system in the EU just is not possible. Nordic countries will not we willing to cut down their welfare programmes and CEE countries, or Portugal and Greece will not be able to meet them somewhere in the middle even if they wanted. They would drive their economies bankrupt. Seriously how do you create a central welfare system in an Union that consists of countries like Sweden or Denmark on one sight and countries like Romania on the other side where literaly half of the people live in material and social deprivation?

&gt; I am from germany and whenever I discuss monetary redistribution within Europe it is usually said that people don't like to pay for countries with lower retirement age or tax-coverage.

Obviously I don't see in people's heads, but my guess would be that it goes deeper than that. Of course people don't want to pay for someone who they think has better lives than them, but they also do not want to pay for someone who they don't consider as one of their own.

753,"&gt;Because the Baathists had been knocked out and the country was not politically-stable — the elected government was not in a position to keep the country together. If you move into a country, you have to deal with the impact on its population.

Then why did the US think it would be a good idea to fire all and every govt employee tied to the Baathist party? It was the only force holding the country together and by eliminating everyone, even a mailman, you destituted thousands of state civil employees to poverty and ISIS. Its almost like the US wanted to absolutely destroy the country from within too. 

&gt;Because it still wasn't able to hold together, and the elected government had asked us to leave. 

&gt;After they lost most of the country to ISIS, they asked for air support, and we did that.

A lot of Iraqis wanted you to leave a long time ago. Of course you had to come back and help clean up the absolute cluster mess of a mess in the middle east that you had created. Surprised no one is being tried for war crimes in the USA.

764,"Well I kind of meant that you don't grant asylum for any chance of getting economically viable people into your country.

The calculations shown above, show that granting asylum other than bachelor and master degree refugee's is a waste of money, economically wise. They require more assistance from the government, courses, and then roll into lower paid job, thus never repaying the investment that society invested into them.

For society asylum seekers are a financial loss.

That migration is a part of modern life is a fact, and thus one can be firmly against accepting (too many) refugees, while at the same time be 100% open to migration from (western)Europe, depending on your views.

Asking if migration could be beneficial is a trap question. The answer is always yes. You could even get beneficial migrants from Somalia, even though the average Somalian is a net loss when it's an asylum seeker.

I would be pro migration when it comes down to a Somalian who got a job here, while at the same time be against family reunification systems put in place.

That is why you can't mix refugees and economic migrants (who got a job). I personally am good friends with someone who migrated from that area, and he describes our system as insanity, as he is familiar with the people from his country and the unemployment rate of Somalian people in the Netherlands.",The Netherlands,/r/europe/comments/7oxzfk/your_opinion_about_refugees_integrationsurvey/dsdbl0j/,Esiq,1515427192

782,"&gt;I think the difference is flexibility, while Russia(for example) is an organism with one head, NATO will have to vote, so there's a huge difference as you might tell

No.  NATO is specifically designed so that it does not grant members the ability to prevent other members from responding to an Article 5 invocation.  If, say, Macedonia joins NATO, she may not prevent the US from responding to an Article 5 invocation by Estonia.

https://www.nato.int/cps/en/SID-ECAE8DB0-F591EC88/natolive/official_texts_17120.htm

&gt;Article 5
&gt;
&gt;The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defence recognised by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.
&gt;
&gt;Any such armed attack and all measures taken as a result thereof shall immediately be reported to the Security Council. Such measures shall be terminated when the Security Council has taken the measures necessary to restore and maintain international peace and security .

What NATO does is to commit every individual member to respond.

It additionally makes use of United Nations Charter, Chapter VII, Article 51 to bypass the UN on use of force for collective security, eliminating Russia's UNSC veto on use of force:

&gt;Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security. Measures taken by Members in the exercise of this right of self-defence shall be immediately reported to the Security Council and shall not in any way affect the authority and responsibility of the Security Council under the present Charter to take at any time such action as it deems necessary in order to maintain or restore international peace and security.

This would grant all NATO members immediate [*causus belli*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casus_belli) against Russia:

&gt;**In the post-World-War-II era, the UN Charter prohibits signatory countries from engaging in war except: 1) as a means of defending themselves— or an ally where treaty obligations require it**—against aggression; 2) unless the UN as a body has given prior approval to the operation. The UN also reserves the right to ask member nations to intervene against non-signatory countries that embark on wars of aggression.[6]

For an offensive war, no such mechanism applies.

&gt;NATO exists because of USA, and because USA can bully everybody into one camp, otherwise, wouldn't be surprised if wwiii would have happened in the '90's or even earlier

The US has issued no threats to ""bully"" countries into NATO.  On the contrary: the reason a country would join is if it feels that Russia is threatening to it.

&gt;again, as a small country, you present very little interest to everyone, if someone wants to bully you, just like in school, you stand no chance, regardless of the team you're on

All members have their treaty-signing credibility on the line.  This is the norm for international treaties and applies to all alliances and agreements.

In the [Korean War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_War), coalition forces fought Soviet air forces, at a time when the Soviet Union was a nuclear power.  It's been a while since then, of course, but we don't have many dust-ups.  But as I said: if you claim that NATO will not respond, you contradict the positions of countries on both sides of the aisle, who clearly feel that it will.  Obviously, there's only one way to ever *prove* it, and that's for Russia to attack a NATO member and accept the consequences, come what may.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/7ot1si/nato_shouldnt_have_offered_membership_to_ukraine/dsdbob8/,vokegaf,1515427293

825,"&gt; Costantinople was dominant during the reign of Justinian, and from 330 to 395.

I'd argue it was the most important city a lot longer than that. Which city rivalled Constantinople in terms of strength, politics, cultural importance and wealth before 1000 AD? The Franks were extremely powerful but their empire didn't last long and the kingdom of France didn't emerge until later, and Cordoba took time after the Moorish conquest to reach its peak. Rome was obviously the centre of the church but after the Schism even that was rivalled by Constantinople. 

&gt;I'm not counting Africa and the Middle East.

850,"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims_(nationality)
&gt;Up until the 19th century, the word Bosniak (Bošnjak) came to refer to all inhabitants of Bosnia regardless of religious affiliation; terms such as ""Boşnak milleti"", ""Boşnak kavmi"", and ""Boşnak taifesi"" (all meaning, roughly, ""the Bosnian people""), were used in the Ottoman Empire to describe Bosnians in an ethnic or ""tribal"" sense. **After the Austro-Hungarian occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1878, the Austrian administration officially endorsed Bošnjaštvo ('Bosniakhood') as the basis of a multi-confessional Bosnian nation. The policy aspired to isolate Bosnia and Herzegovina from its irredentist neighbors (Orthodox Serbia, Catholic Croatia, and the Muslims of the Ottoman Empire) and to negate the concept of Croatian and Serbian nationhood** which had already begun to take ground among Bosnia and Herzegovina's Catholic and Orthodox communities, respectively.[2][3] Nevertheless, in part due to the dominant standing held in the previous centuries by the native Muslim population in Ottoman Bosnia, a sense of Bosnian nationhood was cherished mainly by Muslim Bosnians, while fiercely opposed by nationalists from Serbia and Croatia who were instead opting to claim the Bosnian Muslim population as their own, a move that was rejected by most of them.[4] After World War I, the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later ""Kingdom of Yugoslavia"") was formed and it recognized only those three nationalities in its constitution.

863,"&gt; When is the EU a ""federation"" though.

The problem is that ""federalism"" in the context it's used in EU debates is ... unusual. And not very helpful. Sort of like how ""liberalism"" is used in America to (inaccurately) describe virtually anything left of the political center.

Here's for example how the Encyclopedia Britannica defines federalism:

&gt; *Federalism, mode of political organization that unites separate states or other polities within an overarching political system in such a way as to allow each to maintain its own fundamental political integrity. Federal systems do this by requiring that basic policies be made and implemented through negotiation in some form, so that all the members can share in making and executing decisions. The political principles that animate federal systems emphasize the primacy of bargaining and negotiated coordination among several power centres; they stress the virtues of dispersed power centres as a means for safeguarding individual and local liberties.*

This is typical for how political scientists use the term. ""Federalism"" is a midpoint between a unitarian state (where the central government controls the power and at most devolves some of it to constituent entities) and a confederation (where the member states hold all essential power). In a federation, there's a balance between the central government's power and the power of the member states.

Political scientists sometimes call the EU a federation [""in all but name""](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-94-007-7398-1_8), because the term ""federalism"" seems to be mostly avoided for political reasons, as it has oddly come to mean ""centralization"" to a fairly large number of people in Europe. But the EU as it is right now has all the typical characteristics (good and bad) of a federal system.

Obviously, there's a spectrum here. Different types of federations can strike a different balance of power between the central government and the member states; but federalization generally means a move towards the midpoint, not towards one of the ends; people who suggest that the UK should be federalized, for example, talk about making it less unitarian. Even the debate between Federalists and Anti-Federalists in 18th century America never assumed that the central government would hold all the power, just too much for the taste of the Anti-Federalists (who also considered themselves the ""true federalists"", but the label applied by the Federalists stuck).

This is not to say that one can't have a meaningful debate about what powers the EU should and shouldn't have (other federal systems have similar debates; the one in America keeps going on and on and Germany had a federalism reform a while ago as the result of such a debate).",Migrant,/r/europe/comments/7oxrgf/the_eu_you_want/dsd5rpv/,dances_with_unicorns,1515419824

I'm really sorry, but when your at the point where you kill people for your ideology repeatably the amount of people you kill is a question of statistics. They've already proven that they are willing to do so, over and over again without remorse.

Sure, religious terrorists have killed more, but that doesn't change that the general fucked up mindset isn't different from the RAF ones. Both are perfectly willing to kill other people for their extremist ideas. The major difference and reason why RAF killed less is because they acted a lot more cautious.

&gt; Sure can't argue with that, but there is a difference between a group who does it with the end goal of winning the people over and gaining their support and one that just wants to kill as many people as possible with no political end in the country.

There are swarthy native “white” people all over Europe. Certainly in Germany. I’m one of them. Am I not really German because of my skin pigmentation? Olive skin wasn’t even a disqualifying racial quality in Hitler’s days, but it seems to be one to you.

&gt;Why should Pennsylvania, founded by the English, become a Colony of Aliens, who will shortly be so numerous as to Germanize us instead of our Anglifying them, and will never adopt our Language or Customs, **any more than they can acquire our Complexion.**

&gt;Which leads me to add one Remark: That the Number of purely white People in the World is proportionably very small. All Africa is black or tawny. Asia chiefly tawny. America (exclusive of the new Comers) wholly so. **And in Europe, the Spaniards, Italians, French, Russians and Swedes, are generally of what we call a swarthy Complexion; as are the Germans also,** the Saxons only excepted, who with the English, make the principal Body of White People on the Face of the Earth. I could wish their Numbers were increased. 

&gt;And while we are, as I may call it, Scouring our Planet, by clearing America of Woods, and so making this Side of our Globe reflect a brighter Light to the Eyes of Inhabitants in Mars or Venus, why should we in the Sight of Superior Beings, darken its People? why increase the Sons of Africa, by Planting them in America, where we have so fair an Opportunity, by excluding all Blacks and Tawneys, of increasing the lovely White and Red?

&gt; I think it will not happen

It will absolutely have to happen. Eurozone is a monetary union without a fiscal union, that's a fatal flaw that is causing big troubles to the South. Of course it's not the only problem of the Southern economies, but it is a big issue.

If you want a federation, with one federal government, you will have fiscal transfers. Just look at how much the US is redistributing between its states. Or how much any other country is redistributing between its regions. It's something that happens virtually everywhere, in every functional country.

Governments divert funds from economically well-off areas to economicaly poorer areas in order to keep social order in place. Otherwise the centralization effects that tend to draw people and capital to already developed areas would go completely un-checked.

The EU already partly does this - there are the so called EU funds and poorer countries get more money from them than richer countries. Many people in the richer countries already don't like that they need to contribute to the CEE and SE states in this form.

But if the EU wanted to be an actual country with a federal government, the redistribution effects would certainly have to increase.",Czech Republic,/r/europe/comments/7oxrgf/the_eu_you_want/dsd1rzs/,kristynaZ,1515412335

The effects on the financial system would be even worse. A national currency would be expected to either gain (e.g., Germany) or lose (e.g., Italy) value instantly. Any rational person would therefore transfer capital to the place most likely to gain the most (which wouldn't be good even for the country affected). They would also move capital away from those where it would face instant devaluation, to the point where it would even make sense to free tied capital tied up in assets like homes that you would otherwise not sell. In those countries, banks would need recapitalization, which would raise questions about those governments' credit worthiness.

1038,"&gt;How is deporting back to Morocco inhumane?

I don't know if it's ""inhuman"", but it is problematic. For starters, the European Convention of Human Rights determines that all immigrants have a right to be processed individually, where each person has a series of rights (be given an attorney, appeal the judicial decisions, etc.). If you just return them as soon as they pass the border, you're violating these rights. The Spanish police has done that in the past, and Strasbourg has declared that illegal. European law states they cannot be treated as a collective.

Second, they're not usually from Morocco. They're not its citizens, so they're also illegal immigrants in Morocco, there's no reason for Morocco to want them or accept them back just because. European law about deportations, as far as I know, states that immigrants, when deported, have to be deported back to the country they're citizens of, not to *any* country. They're not from Morocco, Morocco does not want them and they usually do not have any documents and/or lie about their origin.

1221,"&gt; What I meant was even the few religious ones were doing those at most

Yeah, I don't really disagree with your observations, more like recapping them. 

&gt; I'm guessing it's hard for any Western European to understand any problem in the Eastern Europe or in the Mediterranean part of the Europe. Cyprus problem is far more complex than it looks though, I should give you that. I've also seen many Turks and Greeks not understanding it at all, so there is also that. 

True. Many Europeans, including Greeks simplify the problem as ""Muslims in Middle East at it again"" (I don't know what the analogous POV from a Turk would be). 

But Cyprob is a problem of the Modernity, and it has to do with nationalist state-building. Is almost uncanny how religion never played a role even at the peaks of the conflict (1958, 1963, 1974). 

Europeans, with their well-established nation-states since the beginning of nationalism, and their successful cultural &amp; linguistic forced-homogenisation (looking at you France, you started this), do not understand that conflicts like these are the result of failed nation-building (because it started too late, and the historical period that was favourable to nation-building is long gone).

1284,"&gt; To be fair, while religion played no roles in the conflict, the communities were based on the religious backgrounds.

This process of religion -&gt; nation conversation was part of the conflict, because those things didn't match up. Suddenly you had whole Turkish villages in Cyprus with Muslim residents who only spoke Cypriot Greek and they had to be Turkified whether they wanted it or not (a trauma that still lingers today among Rumca-speaking Turkish Cypriots who are in their 70s and 80s now). And you had Christians and Muslims who previously organised together on common material interests (in pan-Cyprian trade unions) forced in 1958 to pick a national side, and so on. So neither the Greek or the Turkish nation-building in Cyprus was completed, and that's why there's no ""clean"" solution. 

&gt; Cyprus can be the part where a true civic or a culture and geography based nation can be built though, and interestingly enough, all communities of Cyprus seem to have a Cypriot national identity, stronger than their ethnic and religious subgroups. I'm not sure if others are going to let you be with that though. 

This proposal comes up again and again, where some sort of Cypriot cultural identity, or Cypriot civic/state nationalism is proposed as the way to heal the divide, but I disagree. 

The time for nation-building is over historically, and even if it wasn't over, it's not desirable to me. The answer to Cyprob is post-nationalism. Post-nationalism here doesn't mean denying the existing national identities -- they are here and trying to weed them out will do more harm than good (examples of this happening are countries like Singapore, which is extremely authoritarian in their attempt to maintain that civic nationalism). 

Instead, we must place our actions beyond nation-building, and focus on cooperating on real, material challenges, and do so while accepting that those who we work together might have different views about nationality, and different citizenship status. By working together, nationalities become distinctions without a difference.

I just said people call you ""right wing"" when you criticize Islam for the exact same reasons that people call you ""left wing"" off when you put forth the exact same argument against Christianity and cite parts of holy scriptures that are translations of each other to back it up.

""left"" vs ""right"" is fucking stupid; people have decided to group a bunch of completely unrelated things together and just lump some unrelated political positions together as ""left"" and others as ""right"" and it largely takes its cues from the US two-party system where people just call whatever they ""associate"" with the Republican parry ""right wing"" and whatever they ""associate"" with the Democratic Party ""left wing"".

Some-where out there is an alternate universe where the US Supreme Court didn't let George Bush have the election; Al Gore was in power and 9/11 hit as usual and it was the Democrats that had to ""act tough"" as a response and the Muslims remained allied with the Republicans as a consequence (yeah they mostly voted Republican before 9/11) and in that world hating Islam is suddenly ""left wing"" and it's largely grouped together with Christianity; the conservative Christians in that universe welcome the Muslim immigrants and they get along great and they are suddenly not blind to the obvious parallels in the religion and instead of desperately searching for the differences they search for the commonalities.",The European flag is phallic as seen from above.,/r/europe/comments/7os54v/56_pedophile_priests_have_been_excluded_from/dscqhab/,alaplaceducalife,1515387098

V -&gt; B is a common language drift. There are numerous mentions of ""Blakumen"" and ""Bolokhoveni"" in the region around the early middle ages.

&gt; What is he supposed to call you?

I haven't read the chronicle of Nestor, but you could try ""Bolokhoveni"" or variants thereof.

&gt; if the people were Vlachs here, surely their appointed ruler would have been Vlach as well, no?

Actually, no, it's rather well known that the nobility in early romanian polities was not of romanian descent and was assimilated in time. Of the earliest recorded ""vlach"" leaders, the four cnezes in western Wallachia, only one had a romanian name, two had slavic names and one had a hungarian name.

In fact the archaic version of the ethnonym ""romanian"", rumân, was also used to refer to a serf in Wallachia.

&gt; Second, there are quite a lot of historical examples where immigrants outbreed native population, like Kosovo in the recent times, Turks and Slavs outbreeding Greeks in interior Anatolia and the Balkans, or English settlers outbreedin Scots from the Lowlands.

But in all those situations, except Kosovo which is more recent, we're talking about a socially dominant population replacing (partially through assimilation) a previous one.

The antimissiles were to protect Europe from Russia, not US. Most of Europe is NATO after all.

&gt;And anyone who seriously believes there's a possibility that the United States is going to attack Russia with nuclear weapons is out of their mind.

US was quite hawkish in its strategic nuclear weapons use doctrine during the Cold War, who knows? Americans are rather optimistic about wars too, having never had one on their own soil. Maybe with antimissile tech sufficiently advanced they may try a nuclear strike, who knows? Trump is just the beginning, your country has fulfilled HL Mencken's prophecy made in the 1920s:

1496,"Well what also quite helped Slovenia keep that status was the fact that we moved factories to Slovenia. 

Just from Serbia, over 100 factories were moved to Slovenia after WW II. It happened partly in due to breakdown of relations with soviet union. 

Also what helped is NATO declaring that in case of Soviet Invasion they would defended their interests up Isonzo line (parts of which were in Slovenia) which was kinda saying unofficially saying NATO would defend Slovenian part of Yugoslavia. So factories there would be safe

Another reason would be since we didn't trade with the soviet union at the time... it made sense to have factories in Slovenia, for easier export.

But nobody decided on this, not factories, not profits, communists took it upon themselves to move factories (whether they'd be willing or not) from other parts of Yugoslavia to Slovenia (Although I can speak only for 100+ from Serbia, I'm not familiar with how much other YU states lost).

1543,"&gt; Vox has a video explaining this specific problem in detail. Vox is super Leftist so it's basically pro migrant propaganda, but just watching it you can see how blatantly obvious it is that migrants are taking advantage of your restraint.

They're identity politics. Economically and in many other respects they seem more like centre or even right-wing at times. They seemed significantly more in line with Clinton than with Sanders.

See here for some context: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vf-k6qOfXz0

But that being said this specific video about the border was actually quite good and explained the problem quite well. 

Obviously the current legal praxis is completely schizophrenic. It directly encourages making compromising deals with rouge states because once you do it yourself (for instance guarding the coast of the meditaranian), they're officially on european soil. Either way we need to revise this policy to remove such stupid incentives. However we need to do it in a way to not pull down our high standard of human rights (unlike the US where human rights exist only on paper). 

In this instance it's really quite clear. Morocco is not a state where most of these people face active persecution. So there is no basis to apply for refugee status. Basicly what has to change is that firstly local help and perspective always needs to come first and taking refugees should apply only if they are either in grave danger or if the neighbouring country they fled to is getting absolutely overcrowded or if the neighbouring country is part of the EU (like with Ukraine). For such measures however there needs to be legal ways because only then we can treat the illegal ways as what they are: illegal. If the only possibility to apply for asylum is to illegally immigrate, then we can't punish the people who do it (that would actually be a barbarian measure that undermines our human rights, though I hear a right-wing dictatorship is not far off from what a lot of people desire these days). So yeah, if you want to stop this, you need to establish legal ways to apply for asylum (well or cut down on civil rights like a true authoritarian).",Germany,/r/europe/comments/7or1pf/two_hundred_migrants_reach_spain_after_storming/dsccfet/,tobias_681,1515369603

1616,"&gt; Interesting read, is this taught in the Hungarian schools?

No, or at least not in this volume, in the school they speak about demographics only from the XVIIIth century in depth.

&gt; Anyway, aren't you forgetting the first Hungarian chronicle ""Gesta Hungarorum"" completed a little bit after 12th century which mentions the ""vlachs"" being in Transylvania proper before the Hungarians and also mentions a ruler called ""Gelou"" who tried to oppose the hungarian armies.

I don't have the Latin version before me, but in the Hungarian version he mentions Blaks, not Vlachs, and he also mentions them grazing in the Somes-valley, which in the Hungarian nomenclature at least wasn’t part of Transylvania proper, it later became to be called Partium.

Before that he describes how Tétény and his people conquered the Cris valley, but no Blaks are mentioned here. Even before that in the “Ladomer and the fort of Galicia” section, he clearly says, that between the Mures and Somes rivers (Transylvania proper) there lived a people called Kozar, under a leadar called Mén-Marót. Also, even if he really was talking about Vlachs (which seems at this point rather dubious), that doesn’t mean that they were there before Hungarians. Anonymus is notoriously unreliable in his claims, he also says our ancestors were the Huns, the Donau-valley is settled by Slovenes, we subjugated the Cumans in Russia, who came with us after that, a lot of similar nonsense.

&gt; Furthermore Nestor (from present day Ukraine) also wrote a chronicle which mentions the presence of vlachs in Transylvania in the 10th century before the Hungarians conquered it. Again, vlachs were there before 14th century.

Can you help me on this one? I searched it for the “wlach”, “vlach”, “wallachian”, “valach”, “blach”, and even “Romanian” words, but I haven’t found anything. What is he supposed to call you?

http://www.mgh-bibliothek.de/dokumente/a/a011458.pdf

&gt; There were mentions of vlachs before that, I don’t know from where you got that idea.

I know of none, can you link me a few then?

&gt; The plague also ravaged the lands in Wallachia and Moldova, not only Transylvania so that doesn’t say much.

Of course it does. Wallachia and Moldova were quiet turbulent regions at those times, meanwhile Transylvania was mostly peaceful. After 1345 we don’t know of any foreign army stepping on Hungarian ground (besides Venetians of course) till the death of Louis. Moldova on the other hand was a battleground between Hungarians and Tatars, and Wallachia was invaded a few times as well. It makes every sense that people would want to escape war into a depopulated, but peaceful region.

&gt; One can notice that a little bit after the 11th century the Hungarian noble man Leustach Rátót becomes voievode of Transylvania. Why would a Hungarian nobleman adopt a title used by vlachs to rule a land which was not inhabited by them I wonder?

Vajda is a word of Slavic origin in Hungarian, comes from voivode, which means leader, and has been used for military commanders before the first mention of a Transylvanian vajda. Also, if the people were Vlachs here, surely their appointed ruler would have been Vlach as well, no? The bans of Croatia have been almost exclusively of South-Slavic origin, so why would the same kings follow the complete opposite policy in an other region of their empire?

&gt; One can also notice that were several settlements with Romanian names such as Alba Iulia named after Iulia, a local ruler mentioned in the 11th century.

So that’s how reliable poor Anonymus is for you? He clearly states that *Gyula* was a descendant of Tétény. In reality, it might have been a title, not a person, but in both cases [it is distinctly Hungarian.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyula_(title))

&gt; The presence of romanains in Transylvania is also supported by demographic data which shows that even after magyarization romanians still had a slight majority which would have been otherwise impossible to acomplish if they had to migrate there.

As I said, Magyarization was quite half-assed, even under the Wekerle-government. E. g. the 1868 law, which compelled both courts and municipalities to conduct business in local languages if a member of minority was involved, remained in place (even if in practice it wasn’t always enforced), 14% of the elementary schools were Romanian language (even more in the 1800’s, after 1880 a lot of minority schools were closed) etc. So first of all let’s not overstate the effects of Magyarization.

Second, there are quite a lot of historical examples where immigrants outbreed native population, like Kosovo in the recent times, Turks and Slavs outbreeding Greeks in interior Anatolia and the Balkans, or English settlers outbreedin Scots from the Lowlands.

God if you don't even read the stuff then why bother? Relevant sections to our discussion: 

Friedman then proceeds to talk about children and adolescents, for whom, he claims, “the experience of gender dysphoria is itself often characterized by flux.” He cites research like Dr. Richard Green’s study from the 1980s and a 2008 study by Madeleine S. C. Wallein from the VU University Medical Center in the Netherlands, which found that many young people who seem to express gender dysphoria grow out of it. “This strongly suggests that gender dysphoria in young children is highly unstable and likely to change,” he asserts, acknowledging there’s no way of knowing what causes the change.

But, he warns, the fact that not all trans kids persist in their identity should guide how parents respond. “So if you were a parent of, say, an 8-year-old boy who said he really wanted to be a girl, you might not immediately accede to your child’s wish, knowing that there is a high probability — 80 percent, in some studies — that that desire will disappear with time.”

There is nothing in these studies to warrant this dangerous encouragement for parents to reject their kids’ identities. In fact, the studies suffer from major flaws that suggest otherwise. Kelley Winters, who studies and writes about transgender medical policy, explains that the criteria for diagnosing Gender Identity Disorder in Children (GIDC) are not particularly consistent. Many recent studies rely on diagnosing children “on the basis of gender nonconforming behavior, with no evidence that they identified as other than their birth-assigned gender.” Thus, children who are actually distressed about their gender identity — the “persisters” — are grouped along with larger numbers of effeminate male-identified boys and masculine female-identified girls — the “desisters.”

Thus, these studies might actually be proving the opposite of what Friedman wants them to. The fact that, in these overbroad samples of gender non-conforming kids, researchers do find persisters suggests that the benefit of the doubt ought to favor these kids who might actually be trans. After all, as this population has been studied more, researchers have learned that they actually identify as consistently and innately with their gender identity as their cisgender peers. Parents risk nothing by letting kids express themselves however they might, but could cause great harm by rejecting the identities of kids who actually feel distress over their gender. The “it’s just a phase” stereotype, as Winters calls it, “has underpinned policies that keep gender dysphoric children in the closets of their birth-assigned gender.”

“Clinicians who take an agnostic watch-and-wait approach in children with gender dysphoria have been accused by some in the transgender community of imposing societal values — that boys should remain boys and girls remain girls — on their patients and have compared them to clinicians who practice reparative therapy for gays,” Friedman admits. “I think that criticism is misguided.”

Instead, he believes that even though ex-gay therapy has been debunked as ineffective and often harmful, “there is no comparable data in the area of gender dysphoria.” Since gender identity is fluid and there are so few comparative studies of gender non-conforming children, there’s no way of knowing if discouraging that non-conformity is actually problematic.

Except, there is such research. The World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH), which sets standards for the health care of transgender people, has explained, “Treatment aimed at trying to change a person’s gender identity and expression to become more congruent with sex assigned at birth has been attempted in the past without success, particularly in the long term. Such treatment is no longer considered ethical.”

Dr. Simon D. Pickstone-Taylor similarly rejected ex-trans therapy in a 2003 letter to the editor in the Journal of the American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry, noting that such treatment is “something disturbingly close to reparative therapy for homosexuals.” Even if children “become good actors,” he explained, “this form of therapy only helps to reinforce the message that they get from society that their instinctual gender identification is fundamentally wrong. This further erodes their self-esteem and increases the psychopthology that is normally seen in these children.”

Conversely, Pickstone-Taylor noted, children who are allowed to express their cross-gender behavior “grow in self-confidence, their comorbid symptoms decrease, and interestingly, extreme cross-gender behavior is reduced.” This ironic last point reflects “children finally being treated in a truly supportive way” and “having the confidence to release their tight and preferential grip on their instinctual opposite-gender interests and behaviors and experiment with others.”

Friedman has no research to demonstrate any benefit to attempting to suppress a child’s gender expression. Still, he bases his skepticism for affirming transgender kids on the “best available scientific evidence.” If he had actually cited that evidence in his op-ed, instead of disregarding it to support his own biases, he may have drawn a different conclusion.

1665,"The fear that the EU would converge on the eurozone, leaving non-euro members on the fringes of European integration as 2nd-class members has in large part motivated the referendum. Cameron got pretty much everything he wanted to safeguard the position of the City (with its associated tax havens) even without joining the euro. That was the best deal the UK could have ever had. It is the self-harming reflexes of populist nationalism that will reduce the nation to the worst deal it can possibly get.

I understand the political sensitivity about the euro; however, in the continental view, political parties also have the duty of forming the political consciousness of the nation. To fan xenophobic sentiments for party-political or opportunistic reasons is the very worst politicians can do.

European integration doesn't happen on its own. It's not something that just drops from the sky. It's been 60 years of sustained effort by the founding members. The EU is a miracle that would never have happened under different circumstances in which the big powers engage in national competition as before 1945. The EU can cope with some smaller members straying from the straight and narrow, but a big country like the UK ought to pull its weight to help cooperation and not to hinder it. It's just not good enough to say we'll wait and see, if the euro succeeds after the others have done the hard work, we'll jump on the bandwagon to reap the benefits. Don't believe for one moment that it was easier for the Germans to give up the DM than it is for the Brits to give up the pound.

You probably think that to be a rather uncompromising position, but those who have witnessed for the last 60 years the great effort it has taken to build the EU, understand that it takes a determined political will. Nobody should take the EU and its benefits for granted.

On a practical level, nobody will expect the Brits to join the euro immediately. After all, there are the Swedes and others who could join any time and nobody is pressing them to join. But I think the opt-outs should have to go and most importantly, British politicians should admit openly to their voters that the EU is of benefit. I remember a teacher at school in the 1950s, who told us that Germany had to pay into the EEC more than it got out, but that that was alright because the EU had great benefit to Germany. And there were many years in which Germany was one of the very few net contributors. Today, more than half a century later, the British establishment still hasn't reached that point and keeps on telling the most atrocious lies about the UK's budget contributions. All that excitement about the so-called exit bill was totally undignified and unnecessary. 

I think Brexit is a great opportunity for the Brits to finally learn something about the EU. As long as they don't correct their views about the EU, full membership seems pointless, because it's going to get us back to all the old tensions. And being half in isn't so much different from being half out. 

I'm emotionally attached to the UK because of my personal history, and I have advocated EU membership ever since the first referendum more than 40 years ago, which I followed in London; however, now I feel that it may be best for both sides for the UK to leave before it can come back. If Brexit were aborted now, the Leave camp would be very disruptive in domestic politics for many years to come.

1706,"&gt;Not to mention that Hungary fought Austria and won against it (1918)

Well the extreme northwest of Hungary was German majority and both states had lost, so between losing states self-determination applied (even at Versailles) and there was never any doubt how the area that became the Austria state of Burgenland would have voted. It's a small area also compared to the rest of what your nation was giving up, so everyone could find it justified giving the land to a fellow losing state. After Hungarian protest and occupation of the area, part of it was subject to a plebiscite in 1921 (but only part of it, because there was pretty much zero doubt about the area that actually became Burgenland and I'm sure you probably accept that). 

&gt;And then a German-majority town voted to stay in Hungary anyway (1921)...

Best I can find on the plebiscite is that it was controversial. It probably wasn't done with international observers.

That said the Carinthian plebiscite in the far south of Austria was similarly controversial and has a very similar result for Austria (some ethnic Slovenes apparently voting to remain in Austria). I would not be shocked if both referendums were completely fair and accurate, or if both were run unfairly.

&gt; Prolonging the lifetime of the plants (which the goverment was planning before Fukushima happened) was called a hindrance to investment for renewables by economists, scientists and environmentalists alike.

The government spent vast amounts of money to shut down *earlier* than the original contracts allowed for. That money could have been poured into subsidizing build out of more renewable energy. 

&gt; Of course, we should shut down lignite and coal as soon as possible with the same rigor, and I hope that it happens soon.

The nuclear shutdown added years to that time horizon. Hence mass murder. I stand by that - the politicians that supported that shutdown has thousands of lives on their hands.

There was a handful of priests that did participate in behaviour of trying to cover up for priests, but that is not representative of the Church as a whole. Such bishops and priests have already been legally dealt with.

As we move forward, such behaviour of priests is condemned by the Vatican again and again. The Church has take quite a few steps in the past decades to ensure that such scandals do no occur again:

1. Men with deep-seated homosexual tendencies are banned from the seminaries and thus from the priesthood. This is the most important step, as the abuse crisis was a homosexual abuse crisis (92%+ of the cases were due to homosexual men abusing adolescent boys). 

2. The screening to actually be admitted into seminaries is very thorough. It involves extensive psychological evaluations, background checks, various examinations, etc. 

This process has been very helpful as we've seen these abuse cases become practically non-existent in the past couple of decades. The psychological evaluations are actually very interesting, there is more information about them [here](http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/ccatheduc/documents/rc_con_ccatheduc_doc_20080628_orientamenti_en.html).

Notice the word GAS, like exactly what i said?
You can run them at 1% and just let them run in sync with the grid in more or less idle and within a very short time ramp them up to 100%

Gas power plants are what you want for frequency management because you can spin them up from 0 to 100% within 10 to 30 minutes depending on the type. And wind power won't suddenly go to zero within ten minutes. So those 2 type are ideal systems to run   in tandem.

Batteries can indeed supply instant energy, but very seldom you need instant energy. One of the few reasons why you would need instant energy is if a large supplier suddenly breaks down. (Large supplies like a 3.2GW nuclear power plant)

1788,"&gt; As if having a gay leader is accomplishment?  
  
Well, I guess so. If it means that the population of the country is willing to look past its inherent phobias and elect someone solely on the basis of its worth.

It would be quite the accomplishment for a person to get elected to the highest political position of a country where 90% of the population is uncomfortable with its sexual orientation.

&gt; If the person is suitable he should be elected as leader but wheter he is gay or not should not have any weight in his election.  
  
Yes, it shouldn't matter. But the poll establishes that, for example in the case of Bulgaria, running for office while being openly LGBT is quite the political handicap to say the least.  So the hypothetical Bulgarian LGBT politician is left with one option; staying in the closet.  

I suppose plenty of people would be fine with this option. And ideally people's sexual orientations should indeed remain a private matter, except that we are talking about politics and you know full well that the second the opposition catches a whiff  of anything that is considered culturally scandalous, or untrustworthy by the public opinion, that information is going to be politically weaponize.  
  
So here we are looking back at that ""cancerous"", ""clickbaity"" title and its stupid question. Is it time? Well, at this time in the case of Bulgaria it is not. Only 9% or less of the Bulgarians would support an LGBT candidate willing to try to compete for the highest state positions.

1822,"&gt; what reasons people generally give for not liking it?

The general Czech mentality is what provides the pre-condition for not liking the EU and then there are plenty of other additional reasons that build up on that. And obviously not all eurosceptic Czechs share all the same reasons.

As for the general mindset - Czechs just don't trust abroad powers. The more intrusive they become, they more we tend to distrust them. The EU is already too intrusive for the Czechs' taste. This logic is strongly ingrained in us, because it was our modus-operandi for centuries.

It also doesn't help that Czechs really generally know little about the EU. For the average Czech, the EU is a big bureacrautic moloch in Brussells, totally detached from the life of an average person in the Czech republic, not reflecting their view at all, it's basically seen as an elitist project of Western Europeans. Which let's be fair here, it kinda is.

The average Czech really knows close to nothing about how the EU works, what it actually does, he/she has zero emotional attachment to it and is convinced that we as a country don't have any influence in there anyway. Almost no one here identifies as EU citizen.

At the same time, Czech euroscepticsm used to be very soft. It was more so EU-indifference. It wasn't like British euroscepticism that was highly activistic. This changed a bit with the migrant crisis. The refugee quotas are something that were really not taken here well at all, people absolutely hate it and cannot even grasp that some foreign authority can dictate us who we should accept into our country.

Another factor is that Czechs largely don't connect the EU with positive factors that people in other CEE countries do. Freedom to work in another EU country? Well you can hardly get an average Czech to move to a different town within the Czech republic, let alone abroad. The average Czech has no ambition to move abroad. EU funds? Those are seen as a source of corruption here. Better living standards? But there was no immediate jump in the Czech republic after 2004, we had a slower and more gradual growth already before 2004, so people don't connect the EU with an economic growth. Help with the fight against the corruption or generally helping with the political culture here? Nope, the EU never made any visible activities here in this direction.

So the TLDR version is that there is a default distrust increased by the lack of knowledge, then there is the failure to see the positives and in contrast the overstressing of the negatives in the public discourse.

But I guess when I write it like this, it seems like a horror story and that we're about to storm out of the EU any second. Which is not the case. The majority of people still want to stay in. The mood is just currently tensed a lot because of the whole fiasco with the migrant crisis.",Czech Republic,/r/europe/comments/7opz4j/poland_support_for_the_countrys_membership_in_the/dsbs5n6/,kristynaZ,1515347544

I see we're talking about future plans rather than actual achievements. This doesn't really help your ""has done more for space exploration in 10 years"" case if they haven't actually done it yet.

&gt; which, btw don't have any delays for now

For someone calling others ""ignorants"" (not actually a word, ironically) you really don't have a clue. All space agencies/companies often have significant delays (""there are lies, damned lies, and launch schedules""), but SpaceX's timetables are up there with The Lord of the Rings for works of fantasy. Falcon heavy was due to launch in 2013, and might launch at the end of January. A crewed capsule was originally set for launch in 2009. Still haven't managed that (though they are making solid progress). SpaceX has plans to provide broadband from space, the first prototype satellites were due in... 2016. No sign of them yet. DragonLab was supposed to start in 2016 but has vanished without a trace. Red Dragon was due for 2018 but has been cancelled. So if you think they will be launching tourists round the moon this year, or building massive spaceships to send to Mars (unmanned 2022 and manned 2024 as per the most recent concoctions... I mean schedules) then I have a bridge, some magic beans, and a unicorn to sell you.

&gt; their massive added value is the series of technological breakthroughs that will massively lower the time and money needed to send anything to space

""Will"" - future tense. In the next few years the only ""exploration"" SpaceX might be doing is sending a couple of rich tourists around the moon. Meanwhile ESA will be exploring Mercury, sending a probe to the sun, launching the greatest ever space telescope, landing a rover on Mars, and heading for Ganymede. Reducing launch costs is great, but it is a singe factor, and only a fool would consider it ""doing more for space exploration"" than ESA.",Ireland,/r/europe/comments/7oq429/european_space_agency_preview_2018/dsbsokd/,ParliamentOfRookies,1515348126

1977,"Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej times as a president of Romania is known as being the most brutal ones, he opressed romanians, hungarians, and any minority. He tortured anyone and everyone. 
 
''One of the most notorious and infamous brainwashing experiments in Eastern Europe’s history took place in Romania, in the political prison of Piteşti, a small town, about 120 km northwest of Bucharest. This prison is infamous in Romania still for the so-called ‘Piteşti experiment’ or Piteşti phenomenon, conducted there between 1949 and 1952. The prison in Pitești and the Pitesti experiment aimed to ‘reeducate’ the (real or imagined) opponents of the regime. It involved psychological and physical torture of prisoners, and the submission of them to humiliating, degrading and dehumanizing acts. Tens of people died in this ‘experiment’, but its aim was not to kill the people, but to ‘reeducate’ them. Some of those who were thus ‘reeducated’ later became torturers themselves. Of those who survived Piteşti, many either took their own lives or ended up in mental institutions.''

2145,"**National Assembly and Bundestag to vote the same text on 22 January**

Rebuilding a new Treaty of L' Élysée is what a resolution proposed on 22 January to the French and German parliaments will propose. A text rejected in advance by Jean-Luc Mélenchon and the insubmissive deputies.

The National Assembly and the German Bundestag are expected to approve a joint resolution on the occasion of the 55th anniversary of the Treaty of Elysée on 22 January, setting out prospects for a new treaty and strengthening cooperation between the two parliaments, the Assembly was told on Wednesday.

The President of the French Republic Emmanuel Macron had indicated on September 28 at the Sorbonne his wish to ""revise the Treaty of the Elysée"", concluded in 1963 by Charles de Gaulle and Konrad Adenauer.

Seizing the ball, German parliamentarians called in a podium published on 11 November for the adoption of an identical resolution by the two lower houses, setting out the ""essential points for relaunching the Franco-German partnership"". Assembly President François de Rugy and his German counterpart Wolfgang Schäuble approved the principle on 13 December.
Enable more links between France and Germany

The text of the resolution was forwarded on 29 December to the parliamentary groups, which have until 4 January to approve it or not, according to the BIA group.

The resolution - transmitted to the AFP by the ""Insubmis"" MEPs - calls for an increase in the powers of the ""Eurodistricts"", those bodies that bring together local authorities from different countries, and for the introduction of ""experimentation clauses in each of the national legislations"".

In line with Mr Macron's speech on 28 September, she argues in favour of ""the creation of a Franco-German economic area with harmonised rules"", in particular as regards company law, bankruptcy rules and company taxation.

On the social level, it calls for ""common standards, guaranteeing a similar level of social rights"" in both countries.

It proposes strengthening links in the field of apprenticeship and training, for example through the creation of a ""Franco-German statute for trainees"".

It also encourages Franco-German cooperation in the fields of defence, the fight against global warming, migration policy and digital technology.

It therefore calls for bilateral projects to be implemented, such as the creation of a ""single energy market"".

The resolution also provides for the setting up of a Franco-German working group, which will have to draft a proposal for a parliamentary agreement before 22 January 2019.

This includes promoting the ""convergence of French and German legislative procedures in transposing European directives into national law"", or joint meetings of the two assemblies ""at least once every four years"".
Unsubordinated France already rejects the block initiative

MEPs of La France insouise (LFI) and their leader, Jean-Luc Mélenchon, announced Wednesday that they refused to sign two draft texts on a new treaty of the Elysée with Germany and a Franco-German parliamentary agreement.

These texts are not editable, they have been written without us and we are invited to sign for approval or not. We will not sign "", says the LFI Group in its press release, which believes that these texts constitute"" a mistake ""towards the other countries of the European Union,"" which they despise by ignoring them "", the"" Franco-German couple ""being in their view"" rightly perceived as an arrogant and archaic executive board "". He accuses their authors of disregarding France's ""real affinities"" with Southern Europe in order to maintain the fiction ""of a privileged relationship with Germany and judges their content to be out of step with the urgency of time.

The elected representatives of the LFI, who fought in vain for the European flag to be removed from the Assembly, criticise these texts for not including any clause on the non-regression of acquired social rights, for not considering any new concrete improvements, for not conceiving the economy from the point of view of private company law and for not being up to par with it in terms of ecology.

Finally, they refuse to sign texts containing, in their view, numerous provisions ""contrary to the specific republican nature of France as a unitary state"". We refuse risky experiments that begin by defeating France,""they explain."" The project of the German right-wing and the presidential party in France is not that of the Republican people, ecologist and socialist, of which we speak.""

Of course, they now have the power to decide. But we have a duty to resist and propose to do something else,""concluded the BIA MPs.",r/Acteuropa r/EuropeanFederalists(🇩🇪 🇪🇺)Je suis d'Allemagne,/r/europe/comments/7oq7ly/plans_for_a_new_elysee_treaty/dsbeznt/,Frenchbaguette123,1515326207

Joint Special Sessions of the German Bundestag and the French National Assembly on the 55th Anniversary of the Elysée Treaty


On the occasion of the 55th anniversary of the German-French Friendship Treaty (""Élysée Treaty"") on 22 January 2018, a joint motion of the CDU/CSU, SPD, B90/The Greens and FDP factions is to be passed in special sessions of the two parliaments. The foreign policy spokesman of the CDU/CSU parliamentary group, Jürgen Hardt, and the chairman of the Franco-German parliamentary group, Andreas Jung, explain this:



The German Bundestag and the French National Assembly want to make a strong commitment to Franco-German friendship on the occasion of the 55th anniversary of the Franco-German Friendship Treaty (Élysée Treaty) on 22 January 2018: In a joint motion, the two governments are to be asked to draw up a new Élysée Treaty and to improve cross-border cooperation. The resolution is both a mandate for governments to act and an impulse for civil society in France and Germany. In addition, a ""Franco-German Parliamentary Agreement"" is to be concluded for the first time.

It is planned that the Bundestag will meet in Berlin on the morning of 22 January 2018 and the Assemblée Nationale in Paris in the afternoon. One delegation from the other Parliament shall be represented at each meeting. In the Bundestag, François de Rugy will speak as President of the National Assembly and in Paris, Wolfgang Schäuble, President of the Bundestag.

On behalf of our group, we drafted a joint text with representatives of the SPD, B90/The Greens and FDP groups and in consultation with French MEPs. The initiative is thus aimed at a broad majority in the Bundestag and the National Assembly. The text reads as follows:
A renewed Élysée treaty is to build on the 1963 friendship treaty and give new impetus to our partnership. This concerns bilateral cooperation as well as our common role in strengthening the European Union and its capacity to act.''.

The ""Franco-German Parliamentary Agreement"" is to be prepared by a bilateral working group and sealed next year. This is intended to further intensify and decisively expand the cooperation between the two parliaments. To this end, procedures are to be developed that will enable a joint position on European issues. Close coordination of the contents is also to be ensured through joint meetings of the technical committees.

Concrete improvements are to be achieved for the people in the border regions. To this end, euro districts are to be strengthened and joint projects implemented. It calls for cross-border expansion of the energy networks as well as a Franco-German infrastructure for electric mobility or Franco-German vocational training centres. Eurodistricts ""are to be given real competences as cross-border regions. The aim is to save them the often arduous journey via Paris, Berlin or the respective provincial capitals "".",r/Acteuropa r/EuropeanFederalists(🇩🇪 🇪🇺)Je suis d'Allemagne,/r/europe/comments/7oq7ly/plans_for_a_new_elysee_treaty/dsbf0bs/,Frenchbaguette123,1515326263

The annexation of Kosovo was never recognized by any other state. When Yusgoslavia was formed they were guaranteed strong autonomy rights. Those rights were cancelled right when Milosevic and his fascists regime came to power. So yeah, *the* Kosovo never belonged to Serbia in the first place.

&gt; They are not more likely to not be religious or anything.

Turkey is nowhere close to being as Irreligious as TCs are. 
The definition of ""religious"" in Cyprus is much more liberal than in Turkey.Think of Izmir or Kadıköy levels of liberalism and then double it.For example, eating pork is not common in Turkey while it is among TCs. Almost no one visits mosques except the settlers who moved there.For TCs that is only exclusive to funeral services etc.

This liberal religiosity stems from a lack of knowledge about the Koran and other religious documents. There was a research carried out by a religious psychologist, I think this was 6 or 7 years ago, which found out that the average Cypriot knew 20% less about Islam when compared to Turkey.

&gt; I wouldn't be surprised if the ratio of religious vs non-religious is the same as Turkey.

The freedom to peacefully practise your religion is a human right. Wearing headscarfs is an Islamic religious practice that don't hurt others.

I am completly against Anti-Semetism and I don't want this to be a part of this nation. Nontheless, this law clearly violates the boundaries of what a general law as set forth in Art. 5 II GG, it is not a general law. It was made clear in the Wunsiedel-decision that only laws can limit the freedom of opinion and expression that are not aimed at a certain idea or opinion, but has to be a law that aims for the usage of speech no matter the exact contant of that speech. The only legal exeption is the glorification of Nazi-Crimes (of which holocaust-denial is a part of), but the argumentation for that is that the German constitution was created as a counter-argument for the Nazi-regime priorly existing and is about making sure that something like what happend shall never happen again, thus the acknowledgment of crimes are outside of the protection of freedom of opinion and expression. But this argument was drafted so that it can never be repeated.

Also, this law is in violation of Art. 3 I GG, the general equallity law. Fundamentally equal situations should be treated fundamentall equal. By only picking anti-semitism out as a reason for deportation, the anti-semetic ideal is put on a special place. What is the exact difference for the single person if they have anti-semetic believes instead of anti-christian, anti-hindu or anti-moslem. If we say that we deport someone that has anti-semetic believes, shouldn't we consider doing the same that do similar stuff against other religions?

I personally am not against such a law in general, just how it is proposed. What I could imagine is a law that dicides that hate crimes are higher evaluated in the process of diciding about deportation. This can include incitment to hatred, but also other hate-related crimes that are more physical, hell, maybe even hate-related insultes could be considered a better reason for deportation than just normal insult. By making it a more neutral law by scrapping anti-semitism as the main focus and instead make it hate-related actions, anti-semetism is also included, while not leaving out the other possible anti-xxx movements.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/7oj28x/german_conservatives_to_propose_deporting/dsbaoob/,MisterMysterios,1515314099

2453,"&gt;Ok, what does this prove about news media as a whole?

It's a solid non political example of a phenomena that's clearly pervasive throughout our media of them being click baity, not insightful, and overall not making the people watching them any smarter or better informed. Add on top of this the fact that news orgs act as activists when it comes to politics and the distrust that has built up is deserved.

&gt;Well they actually do, it's just that you are more aware of the failures.

No they don't. If I run an economic system that has an improvement from 7% growth to 10% growth for years, but has a hidden effect where you wipe out in year 12 then the net effect of that policy is bad.

It's like a turkey that gets fed by humans every day instead of having to take care of itself. Everything is great until Thanksgiving day when the turkey is killed. It would have been smarter to not have gone in that dumb direction even though it only blew up on the final day. People like Robert Rubin made 100s of millions sending our economy in the direction the turkey went and then paid none of it back when it blew up. It's fraud as far as I'm concerned.

There is far too much entropy as our systems have gotten more complex and we are subject to too many random crazy events that lead to these models blowing up.

My prime example will be the huge assumption so many banks made about mortgages maintaining their 4% default rate in the run up to 2008. It only went up a few percentage points and would have collapsed our entire financial infrastructure if those losses weren't transferred onto the public. By the way, the decision makers who enabled that have not paid any price for it except for a few sacrificial lambs like Dick Fuld.


&gt;Is this ""bullshitter"" not an economist?

Referring to the hedge fund guy, it doesn't matter if he's an economist. My point was that it's someone who is selling expertise at making predictions in super complex dynamic systems (less complicated than foreign policy or a whole economy which is even worse). It's obvious based on their results whether or not they're a fraud. They have skin in the game with their predictions and if they lose all of their clients money they are rightfully pushed out of the system.

Also, when hedge funds go broke they don't get bailed out by taxpayers. This accountability is not pushed upon the Economics and Foreign Policy Establishments.

&gt;What about about good doctors that fail?

There are already clear standards here. If it's the doctors fault in a surgery that goes wrong then they are liable to be sued by a patient. Even if they're a good doctor they still have skin in the game. Obviously sometimes procedures don't work, but to argue that doctors are consistently exempt from consequences in the same way economists are is wrong. It was an imperfect comparison, but the idea should be clear enough.

Moldovans are afraid to live without corruption and without Russia (which is where we learned to be corrupt from).

Moldovans are a great people, but very bad at electing a government.

Yes, pretty much. That's why it's called ""GREEK history"". It makes sense doesn't it?

&gt;Troy is in Turkey last I checked and Ottoman Empire had more to do with Eastern Roman Empire than the Greek rump state liberated in 1832

What are you even talking about?

&gt;Ancient Greece was a pagan Indo European civilization which flourished before Rome and which spread across Balkans, Italy, Crete and the Mediterranean.

Regardless of when it flourished, ancient Greece continued to exist even after its conquest by the Romans to the point that the Eastern Roman Empire was Hellenized halfway thought its lifetime. ""Pagan"" doesn't mean anything. The Roman empire was pagan at first and then it was christian still it was the Roman empire. Religion doesn't absolve a civilization of its history.

Are there other people like slavs that intermixed with Greeks? Sure, which nation doesn't have intermixing after thousands of years?

I simply expressed my opinion about it, get over it.

What, where did I change the definition of the word? Or get stuck over the word? You thought it was related to that. After I presented you evidence you kept claiming that you see many germans and what not. We can easily get over it. All you need to do is stop claiming bullshit. Optionally you can also admit that you talked out of your ass.

&gt; If you wanna see the facts about the crime rates rising, go search for it. You have all the info there, I'm not trying to support some conspiracy theory, it's all based on facts and statistics I read at some point. 

After your various claims that are evidently wrong I highly doubt you really consider facts and statistics. You rather consider stories that fit your narrative.

&gt; Media covering up was referring to the rapes and crimes, as it was for the Cologne example and you know it lol. Stop taking words out of context and changing the topic trying to avoid the fact that I was right. The big majority of them are unemployed, their arrival in Germany did increase the crime rate. Find me a source that contradicts that if you want, I doubt you will. 

Where was it covered up? It was under-reported for one day, or two if you include the first of january. Under reported means it was still in the newspapers, tv stations, websites, just not a headlineas it was from the 3d and 4th and onwards. And then it was massive as every shitty website had a special about it.

But lets drop that. You claim there is a strategic effort to cover up. Where are the other cover-ups?

One theory is that it is of ultimately Iranian origin""

That doesn't dispute what I showed earlier, you're just trying to dodge the facts. Originated from eastern slavic lands, close to the caucasus, with an ethnonym derived from the Serboi, a sarmatian tribe. Glad we're in agreement.

You are essentially slavized vlachs though, considering genetics, with ethnonym being of unsure origin. Since the sarmatian origin makes the most sense, it is probably that. Through the Sarbans from Afghanistan. ""facts"" xd.

Zero identity crisis about Albanian identity. The ethnogenesis formed where we are, genetics largely identical to how they were from at least antique era. More than can be said for the re-invented Serboi. Only way for Albanians to be similar to Serbs is if we were to go back to pre-Indo-Europeans in the balkans, but the ethnogenesis, the people and the language, were formed after that, so it is irrelevant. For the Serbs it is different, you are mixed, your ethnogenesis happened somewhere else and you are not what you were, many Serbs that do genetic tests to see where they are placed in terms of ""ancestry"" get the picture quite clearly.

You brought up a lot of things in a single bucket, but these need to be handled separately.

One of these was government officials not responding to your letters(selgitustaotlus) within 30 days, or extending that deadline to 60 days and then responding.

I have some experience with this, sadly I'm not much help with most of the other issues.

Document each of these encounters separately and show that you've followed the law when sending these questions in.

For each response not given, make a complaint to the chancellor of justice(õiguskantsler). Don't make it about the contents of your query. Make it about the fact that sufficient explanations have not been given and officials are not responding to your queries.

Show that there are documented cases of officials breaking the ""Märgukirjale ja selgitustaotlusele vastamise ning kollektiivse pöördumise esitamise"" law.

The chancellor of justice is there to ensure that proper procedure is followed when citizens send in queries. If they do not ensure that turn to the European Ombudsman. Again don't make it about the contents of these queries, make it about how due process was not followed.

On your side, you have ""avaliku teabe seadus"", ""Märgukirjale ja selgitustaotlusele vastamise ning kollektiivse pöördumise esitamise seadus"", ""The European Code of Good Administrative Behaviour"" and constitutions § 44.

Once you can clearly show that due process has not been followed, the (other) institutions will start helping you. If the code of good administrative behaviour has not been followed the European ombudsman will take it up and force them to start giving you answers.

But for this to happen you need to distance your feelings and show that the real issue is the way your case has been treated. Not the contents of your case. I know it's difficult, but it can be done and the EU has given us more tools than we realize.

Once you've managed to sort out how they are communicating you can start to tackle the real issue, but you really need to sort out the communication first.

I don't know.. Why is German history German and the Mexicans don't have a right to it? Why don't the Spanish have a right to Chinese history? Do you actually read what you're typing? The Greeks have a right to Greek history because the continuation of the Greek people wasn't broken. They're not a new race that simply relocated there, unlike FYROMacedonians which is a Slavic people despite the name.

Says who? Do you mean culturally cause that wouldn't be weird since we're talking about a difference if thousands of years..

&gt;and politically I don't think you can claim direct descent from any Greek polis or state.

as a response to my worry the demands can never be met without a massive transfer of wealth from Europe to Africa, effectivly ending the way our societies are organised I have all reason to response in anger. My outrage isn't ""faux"".

That was what we were talking about. Inform me next time if you are going to switch the subject midway and pretend it was always about the capitalist system.

I'll be honest here... I get the gist of what you meant. But to me it seems like a sentiment and dogma rather than a practical goal. A noble sentiment, but not based in any form of pragmatism or realism. You haven't at any point shown me how Europe is supposed to meet any reperation demands.

European militaries aren't very well funded, as a percantage of out gdp compared to the rest of the world. There is little room to build them down further.

Both the corporations and banking system are part of the global economic system. It goes much farther than just Europe vs Africa in that regard. It is also the basis of out wealth, the very wealth that supports our socialized and democratizing institutions you pretend would continue to exist. You can't just magically remove them and expect our lives to remain the same.

That too doesn't really have that much to do with the topic on hand; the problems sports institutions have with transpeople is quite a different topic than the ""problems"" biologists have with it.

It's not just transpeople; there was a problem a while back of someone who looked somewhat female beating running records with abnormally high amounts of androgens for a female and it turns out her ""ovaries"" were some-what in-between ovaries and testes but still internal and her entire reproductive system looked a bit weird.

Biologists very much have a problem with something like this.

There's also a debate on how to classify people who produce male-amounts of androgens but suffer from androgen insensitivity conditions.

&gt; Here is a wikipedia link about the male sex: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male

&gt; A male (♂) organism is the physiological sex that produces sperm.

Uhuh so you stop being male once you get castrated? even if this happens in adulthood?

Cross-species the sex that is male is indeed typically defined as the one that produces the smaller gamets but there are numerous problems with this such as organisms being born that don't produce gametes at all or who later lost their ability to produce gamets. Now you'd just say ""Okay, let's called it once produced those gametes"" but then you run into the problem that several organisms naturally change their sex over their lifetime like various fish where the females become male if there is a shortage of males.

There are tons of Muslim states, and tons of Christian states, but without Israel Jews would be the only major world religion without a homeland. If you're attacking Israel because you don't believe Jews deserve a homeland, that is antisemitic.

The problem is that this is not feasible. Are they supposed to live under the Palestinian Authority?

You might not have noticed, but Europe has been having massive economical issues for the last 10 years where we only now are starting to come back from. Why do you think I asked you ""how much""? Simple, because the people demanding reparations often pretend Africa would be as/more developed than Europe if colonialism hadn't happened. 

Where do you think we'd get enough money from to pull an entire continent to our level? Nah, you live in a fantasy world. We can't improve/atone unless we sacrifice our own elderly, our own poor and our own sick. Which isn't happening. Simple as that.

On the issue of corporations, you are more than welcome to tax them in return for allowing them to enter. Because we, the actual people living in Europe, aren't getting that wealth from them. Much like you aren't. I wonder whether Chinese today prefered it before factories exported over there regardless. Quite a few people have been lifted out of poverty due to 'expoitation"".Guess you'd prefer them poor or believe wealth comes automatically.

If you demand money from us, because companies we do not benefit from exploit you my answer would be to direct your demands at them.

Also notice, the discussion about present crimes and punishment in the neo-colonial era is a different one from the colonial era. I have much less of an issue with the first than the second... as I can actually have an impact on it. 

Your last sentence is honestly nonsense. I am European. It is my identity. How the hell would I know how I'd feel if I were an African. A pointless statement. Not all of Africa is poorer than Europe, as you should really now. Much depends on where I'm born.

IANAL, but I'm sure some of the Germans with a better understanding of law will chime in in case I'm completely off here. I'm however rather confident that this should be understood as a *legal* document and not in the common sense of the word.

Analogue things like ""inciting hatred"" or even ""insults"" have specific legal definition that don't always line up with how the words are normally used.

3180,"&gt; In the end the connection between a biological mother and her child is unique and different to any legal or non legal connection.

No, actually the connection is completely a social construct. When you have two identical siblings and one of them gives birth there is after that point no real way to tell any more which of the two was the biological parent of the child in fact if the chromosomes recombine in a coincidental way you can't even tell any more when they're just normal siblings.

It's a social construct in the same way virginity is in that a specialist can't inspect someone's body to determine whether someone is a virgin and losing your virginity doesn't magically change your body in any way; if you weren't there to record the event there is no way to tell.

&gt; Or to put it differently, there are millions of bands you can like, millions of neighbours you could have, millions of legal parents that could adopt you but there is always only one biological mother and one biological father.

3183,"&gt;Iranian theory is the most widely supported theory on the origin of the current Serbian ethnogenesis, that is where it was formed. Funny how emotional you get over the well supported theory though.

Serbians have the same origin as other South Slavs, from Eastern Slavic lands. Migrated south-west to the Balkans, absorbing Paleo-Balkan population at the time. They have no connection to these Caucasian tribes outside obscure theories.

&gt;Meanwhile in your own link it is stated that the actual endonym of ""Caucasian Albanians"" is unknown, and the language is Lezgic, which is different from the Albanian language. ""Facts"" xd.

Yeah, I know Albanians have nothing to do with Caucasian Albania, I'm just posting ""facts"" like you did.

You stopped reading after a while, perhaps it didn't fit your agenda, but here you go:

&gt;In the 10th century, Byzantine emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos (912–959) mentioned in his book De Ceremoniis two tribes named Krevatades (Krevatas) and Sarban (Sarbani), which some researches identified as Croats and Serbs. These tribes were located in the Caucasus near the river Terek, between Alania and Tsanaria. The Sarban tribe in the Caucasus in the 10th century was also recorded by an Arab geographer.

By the 10th century Serbs and Croats already had their own states established in the Balkans. Albanians didn't, so maybe you should look for them.

&gt;I couldn't care less about the age of the church, I don't follow middle eastern sects.

'Solar energy is commonly seen as a future energy source with significant potential. Ruthenium, gallium, indium and several other rare elements are common and vital components of many solar energy technologies, including dye-sensitized solar cells, CIGS cells and various artificial photosynthesis approaches. This study surveys solar energy technologies and their reliance on rare metals such as indium, gallium, and ruthenium. Several of these rare materials do not occur as primary ores, and are found as byproducts associated with primary base metal ores. This will have an impact on future production trends and the availability for various applications. In addition, the geological reserves of many vital metals are scarce and severely limit the potential of certain solar energy technologies. It is the conclusion of this study that certain solar energy concepts are unrealistic in terms of achieving TeraWatt (TW) scales.'

Romania found about this plan first from the Poles and later from the British Foreign Ministry.

After receiving this information, Ceausescu started to search for allies that would help him in a war with the Warsaw Pact troops, all while USSR troops started mobilizing near the Romanian border in the south (Bulgaria), north(Poland, Hungary and Russia).  Yugoslavia was the only neighbouring country that didn't want to attack us and according to the Romanian archives they would have  guaranteed safe passage for Romanian troops with one condition, all military equipment should be left behind.

During his search for allies, it seems Ceausescu managed to convince chinese prime-minister Zhou Enlai to support Romania's independence but ,unbeknownst to Ceausescu , NATO decided in a meeting that they wouldn't help Romania in a war.

After 8-9 months since the threat started we only had one ally: China, but it seems that US intervened for Romania with a veiled threat that it's best for world peace if USSR would stop interfering with other countries independence. Also, UK boosted they military power in the mediterranean under the pretext of war exercises.

The Russia archives of that moment are still secret so we might never know what compelled USSR to stop the invasion of Romania, but we can speculate based on the NATO and Romanian archives that the involvement of US, UK and China helped us avoid a full scale invasion.",Government-less Romania,/r/europe/comments/7oehxg/50_years_ago_today_alexander_dubček_was_elected/ds9sfmy/,ax8l,1515239429
3316,"&gt; But anyway the guy who worked as the minder of the rental properties in Kotor told us how for many people their if you didn’t vote for a certain politician or party your shop license or meat license or planning permission etc. would “go missing” and the like

Well I couldn't say that since I'm not working in the private sector but I've heard of several instances like that. One thing that's really shameful is that, until recently, if you were a ruling party member and built, say a house without a permit, you would recieve it after building the first floor. And if you were a member of the opposition party, the place where you planned to build your house (in the countryside) would suddenly appear in the urban planning as a zone where house-building is not allowed. If you went to the government website for urban planning and look at the map it would appear in a zone where, say a two-story house could be built.

3374,"&gt;  So in the end, like in the US, it all relies on the judicial branch.

Except there is a difference in how strong those protections are. The judicial branch can't legislate, it can just limit the executive branch *within the current limits of the law*.

If the limit is ""you can't restrict speech, fullstop"", the executive branch has very little space to maneuver and fuck around with.

If the limit is ""we have FreeSpeech™*   *terms and conditions apply"" then the executive branch has a lot to work with.

I don't need to read the entirety of your constitution to know that you don't have as strong protections as the US, much how I don't have to read North Korea's or China's constitutions to know they don't have as strong Free Speech protection as Germany does.

You *currently* have laws that censor speech that are not unconstitutional. You have laws that censor speech not just in specific circumnstances (ie hate f.ex.) but also on its perceived ""correctness"" (laws banning 'fake news').

Unless those laws are unconstitutional, which no court in Germany has deemed them as, then it's self-evident that the German constitution offers much weaker protections to freedom of speech and allows for your politicians to censor you.

Which is still incredible to me that you support that.

That's not how trade works. Cosmetics aren't cheaper in Germany because they are made there - many aren't - but because there is fierce competition between retailers. 

&gt; At the end of the day, the cost of living in Greece is considerably lower than in Germany, and that's why many North Europeans retire in Greece. 

It really, really isn't. Unless you are living on coffee and cigarettes - both cheaper in Greece - your day to day living will be about equal to more expensive. At least when living in Athens. The only way to get ahead is growing some produce yourself and trading with your neighbors. Also, not many people from abroad retire in Greece, certainly not in comparison to places like Spain.

Overall multi-speed set up is a risky project.

All nuclear proponents in every nation, during every time period, argued that their particular source of nuclear power was the best and safest.  Chernobyl was promoted to the locals as being extraordinarily safe.  As was the plant in Fukushima.  Only after the fact and in hindsight did people truly focus upon the previously marginalized voices which were trying to highlight the risks.  

Chernobyl wasn't really a problem of idiocy, it was a problem of hubris.  And I don't think hubris is lacking in modern America.

3812,"Can’t keep myself from not commenting, especially since I’m Armenian and this is a sensitive issue. 

This area has always been Armenian since antiquity until the inception of what is now called Azerbaijan from Turkic tribes coming to the region and claiming everything. Even by then, if you look at the population stats for the area, it was inhabited by both Armenians and Azeris more or less evenly. The Soviets gave the region, alongside the region of Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabakh) to the newly created Azerbaijan in hopes of grabbing Turkey’s attention towards the whole Soviet trend, also implementing the “divide and conquer” thing. As is the general case with our history, Turks have massacred us pretty much every chance they’ve gotten (Armenian genocide being the most well known one). Same case with Nakhichevan. So by the time of the Soviet collapse, no Armenians were left in the province to contest Nakhichevan’s “desire to rejoin Azerbaijan”. That’s why we have the weird land situation right now. 

They’ve tried to do the same with Artsakh, but fortunately people there were more resilient and actually started to fight back, hence the war you mentioned. Fortunately we have managed to keep a part of our ancestral land at least.

I’ve still generalized a lot and the fact that I myself am Armenian doesn’t help, but I’ve tried to be as unbiased as possible. You can lookup any of the things I’ve mentioned and verify them for yourself.

I saw a post not a while ago here describing Armenians as poorly located Christians. Couldn’t have described our history any better unfortunately :(",,/r/europe/comments/7oczbh/a_whole_video_a_bout_a_azerbaijani_province/ds9945u/,armen_ia,1515203466

First of all, you have no idea what you're talking about. The Kurdish issue was not a civil war, completely unrelated. The fight against PKK has been going on for, decades, yes it literally is a war against terror. If there was a civil war with the Kurds, remember there are 15-20 MILLION of them in Turkey, you'd think we would all be talking about it, don't you? Come on man.

&gt;But EU also recognizes the human rights problems arising from the Kurdish issue. Europe have had 2 world wars because of this nationalist ideology.

Kurds are allowed to have education in their native language. There are Kurdish-only schools. They are allowed to speak Kurdish wherever they want. They have their own political parties and are allowed to organize walks and protests. We don't ethnically enlist people as 'Turkish' or 'Kurdish'. Even our nationalist parties (MHP) aren't separatists, or against Kurdish people (many MHP members were Kurds, and moved to BDP later). So I want to ask, what exactly are you referring to?

I am not kurdish. Notice the word barzo you use tying to this whole thing we are discussing here. 

* Kurd can optionally take education in Kurdish...yes. decade old story. The point is, as a minority, they need MINORITY STATUS which gives them autonomy in the cultural realm like education, so Kurds can be school ONLY in their native language FIRST, and THEN, they can take optional second language. 

So no, Kurds don't have equal rights. Thats not how equal rights works. 
""right to education in your first language"" means right to education foremost in Kurdish....

In many cases, there are also administrative autonomy where a minority is allowed to manage its own geography to an extend with relative fiscal autonomy. 
These decentralization models are one of the chapters that tie to cohesion policy and other issues that go into chapters involving human rights, democracy...etc

3906,"&gt;You don't need batteries to maintain the grid frequency if you have gas power plants.

You do if they aren't running because wind/solar are producing enough.  The Australian electricity regulator has now begun capping wind/solar production in South Australia, with a rule that a certain amount of gas generation must be supplying the grid at all times to provide stability. See for example: http://reneweconomy.com.au/new-back-up-rule-means-end-of-cheap-wind-power-in-south-australia-60119/

Wind and solar, when running, do not provide frequency management. Either we have to retain a lot of conventional thermal power, or we have to pay for batteries to do the job instead.

&gt;And if a single wind turbine fails it's no big deal. Unlike if a 3.2GW nuclear reactor has to perform a scram, when battery backups would actually be a good idea.

A single wind turbine failing isn't a big deal. Wind speeds dropping, affecting all turbines, is.

UK wind electricity production last year:

Maximum 9.7 GW  
Minimum 0.15 GW

Wind cannot be relied on for any significant amount of power, which is why we have to have 100% backup available.

&gt;The 60 years expected lifetime is also cute. I checked the UK nuclear power plants, nearly all reactors (even those still running) stay below 40. Over half have reached or will only reach 30 years.

They are all pretty old designs, though. The US has a couple of generation 2 reactors that became operational in 1969 that are still running. One is licensed to operate until 2029, which would be 60 years, although it might be shut early.

&gt;Then you ignored the cost of decommissioning the plant later, which is unknown at this point.

Decommissioning is included in the cost. Decommissioning costs are likely to fall in future with the widespread adoption of robotics.

&gt;Look, i am actually not against nuclear power and i think the general risks (in terms of safety) can be managed pretty well. But there are so many unknowns going into the future it's really not a good idea to plan for 60 years.

It's better to plan for 60 years than to keep pumping CO2 into the atmosphere. We know what the result of that will be.

It's possible some new technology will come along in 10 or 20 years that will make fission obsolete. We might find that if we had waited we would have saved some money. But it's equally possible (indeed likely) that no new technology will replace fission. Fusion has been 20 years away for the last 50 years. Batteries are very unlikely to fall far enough in price. CCS doesn't seem to be viable. Do we wait 20 years and keep on emitting CO2, or do we use the only technology we have that will reduce emissions enough?

&gt;In the best case nuclear power is cheaper. In the worst case it's so expensive and outdated that in 2050 the Hinkley plant will be shutdown because it's no longer economically viable to run it.

But in either case it will reduce CO2 emissions by a tremendous amount. Waiting for some alternative will not. I think the risk to the climate is urgent enough that we have to act now (indeed, I think we've waited too long already). Waiting another couple of decades to see if something better comes along isn't an option.

&gt;Those are financial risks i wouldn't take.

A de facto state like the EU needs citizens that identify with it. This generates longterm political and social stability. Without these two ingredients any kind of rule of law or secured trade is not possible.

Hence the spending of a comparatively small sum for a project that might help to foster a more stable and peaceful europe is a very effective and efficient thing to do.

4137,Energy required to stop and restart coal and atom plants is larger than to let it run. Spikes in wind and solar production are very short. It's more economical to keep coal and atom plants running at lowest possible setting and sell extra energy for basically nothing. The thing is you still produce waste and make your energy system less efficient. But there's no other way. That's why most of people opposing renewable energy say that the money invested in it should go towards atom energy. Cause it's a sure source of energy and doesn't need backup plants to run alongside it. And it's also cheaper if you account energy sold for nothing produced during these peaks.,Pomerania (Poland),/r/europe/comments/7o9xi8/yesterday_wind_produced_23_of_europes_electricity/ds8p8l0/,Ussurin,1515182007
4138,"&gt; What, you can't do it?

Well it didn't work against Hitler. Part of what normalized the holocaust and his dictatorship was his hateful rhetoric against jews and ""cultural bolschevism"" which was supposedly going to destroy Germany (reminds you of anything?), and thus legitimized his claims to absolute power.

They could have ""used their own freedom of speech to debunk"" Hitler before he won a 32% and became Chancellor and went for total control, but that didn't happen.

That's why there are laws against holocaust denial in the first place. Hitler is arguably the demonstration that tolerant-of-all free speech may not always lead to the intended effect (see: paradox of tolerance).

I mean, ya I guess, but you're being a meme if you're going to count a state government that rules over 20 million people count for the entire 330 million people that live in this country. Let me re emphasize that. If you take Texas out of the equation you still have another 300 million people we are talking about.

&gt;Those 19 states are in the US right?

Same argument, but a lot more fair this time. Still, that's 38% of the states, and those states generally speaking have smaller populations, so it's an even smaller percent of the population. To your credit though I the federal government can still use the death penalty, but it's pretty much impossible to get the federal government to try you for something unless it's treason.

&gt;About 25% of women go back to work 10 days after having a baby.

Fair. I concede this point.

&gt;This german law very well might also be illegal.

Never argued against that. [If you actually check my comment history](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/7oajeb/free_speech_vs_censorship_in_germany/ds8n9v8/?context=3&amp;st=jc2c6ten&amp;sh=7e842ca7) you'll see I have gotten aggressive towards people for thinking that this law represents Germans as a whole.

&gt;They still live there though... In the US.... without any voting rights, what about puerto rico?

Puerto Rico isn't a state. They should either become a state or become independent (they won't become independent because their economy relies on being part of the US and they are relying on us to repair their already shit infrastructure after the hurricane.) Something like 97% of Puerto Ricans, when last polled, wanted to become a State, so we will see how that goes!

&gt;Nice adhominen, but no my government cannot legally see do that without a warrant, however your government can, and does do that.

And if a single wind turbine fails it's no big deal. Unlike if a 3.2GW nuclear reactor has to perform a scram, when battery backups would actually be a good idea.

The 60 years expected lifetime is also cute. I checked the UK nuclear power plants, nearly all reactors (even those still running) stay below 40.  Over half have reached or will only reach 30 years.

Then you ignored the cost of decommissioning the plant later, which is unknown at this point. The NDA however costs 3b per year and they expect to cost about 160b for the sites they manage. But oh wonder, that estimated cost has increased every single year and their plans are for 100 years.

Look, i am actually not against nuclear power and i think the general risks (in terms of safety) can be managed pretty well. But there are so many unknowns going into the future it's really not a good idea to plan for 60 years. 

In the best case nuclear power is cheaper. In the worst case it's so expensive and outdated that in 2050 the Hinkley plant will be shutdown because it's no longer economically viable to run it.

4226,"&gt;we all know they dont give a damn about most human rights...

Most, perhaps, but they've been decent-ish about freedom of speech.

Not that I think that that's about convictions, as your own link proves they're not that shy to make exceptions either. But American political life is broader, the Overton window is wider but also thinner, so it is less politically tenable to just shut anyone up.

In European countries, usually there's just one opinion, and everyone else is at least put outside the mainstream. Germany seems to be moving to outright muffle them. 

I am sure that every side in America would love the same thing as long as they could be in charge. I'm under no pretention that they're better than us. But none of them are actually in full charge. The Republicans nominally have the government, but the bureaucracy and the media are Democrat. The Republicans are then split into Trumpers and 'normal' conservatives whereas the Democrats are split into the Sanders camp and the Hillary camp, and nobody has the power to really shut anybody else up. 

Here in the Netherlands, all major parties agree on the basics, the government they form runs the media either directly (TV and radio) or indirectly (the newspapers), the new media on the Internet being the exception. (Of course, this freedom also means the Internet media are free from any kind of ethical concerns, so trusting them at their word isn't a good idea *either*.)

It could be 1% more, it could be 1000% more: there will be an increase, as law abiding citizens are given a huge 'it's okay' signal which is completely wrong at the same time.

Each has its own government and constitution. The US was formed as a federation of independent states just like the EU is sort of trying to do.

Also, during the 19th century the US was extremely more decentralized and the federal government was much much weaker than it even it now. The government in Wyoming was basically the government for people in Wyoming. Back then the federal government didn't really do much but run the military and the post office.


The 6% figure cannot be right though because I have read that at the time of the American revolution that the franchise was only extended to like 6% of the British population and the American franchise was greatly larger than the British franchise for no other reason than most Americans were landowners and the US didn't have the rotten Bourgoughs that Britiain did before the parliament was reformed in the 1800's.

Like, land is cheap in America today and was even dirt cheaper 200 years ago. Almost the entire white population in 1776 were farmers who owned their own land and whose head males had the franchise.

What can you do with 300 billion euros? Well one thing is replace half of the cars in Germany with ones that consume 2L per 100km. That would have halved the CO2 emission of cars basically. For the same price you can also renovate all old housing and make them less energy-wasting.

However these problems won't be solved by simply shilling towards either of both direction. 

There is a ton of research done on how to conveniently store electricity and there is no point in stopping just because the current technology doesn't suit all our needs. 

The reason why solar and wind energy got huge in the recent years isn't because 'these dumb politicians are trying to screw us', it's because they are one of the first energy solutions that are almost perfectly scalable with budget. 

If you drive through the German countryside you'll see many houses with solar roofs and many wind turbines. 
This is simply because little communities and even single households are able to make investments that allows them to be more independent or make profit. 
The people complaining about wind turbines 'ruining the nice view' are almost never the ones living in said area. Communities or farmers make huge profits renting space for turbines. 

Wind and solar power is simply the best we came up with yet, even if it might suck in parts. If people come up with a better solution, simply scrap solar panels and wind turbines and we're fine.

Is the social situation bad? Sure! I, for example, hate the regressive and conservative mindset of most Latvians, and our Northern European individualist culture means that it's very easy to fall into lonliness, depression and alcoholism. 

The issue with ''making money'' is that we're living in Europe. I want to make as much as Swedes etc. not because they live better, but because they have a bigger chance to get bigger savings. I'd kill for a chance to murder in Norway even for a summer, so that I could save up, say, 800 euros and IMMEDIATELY go on vacation, or buy a car, or start saving up for my own apartment. Work abroad is no easier than here, nor is it easier to find, but it's silly to discount the effect of, well, ''jealousy''? Because I am not ashamed to admit that I am ''jealous'' of my Western European peers and their larger amounts of disposable income, which can be used for extreme effect in many countries. There's a reason why I am looking forwards to travelling to Ukraine - I will, for the first time ever, not feel like a poor piece of shit abroad. And this is something that can be achieved by working abroad - but this is, obviously, just one of the aspects of emmigration.

4431,"&gt; Forget about pragmatism, you are now the king and make rules, let us hear your ideal world.

First of all, I want to kill Reddit's laissez-faire liberalism before we move on. The idea that revolves around the notion that there should only be rights for everyone, but obligations for none, needs to die. That's important, especially in these types of debates. 

Moving on, let it be clear that I don't make the rules: parliament does. And if the lawgiver in country X wants to issue such rules, that is final. You can be obligated to not do certain things, and there are good reasons for outlawing certain things. As said above, a few of those reasons could be public health, public security or moral grounds. There's certainly enough room to argue for banning certain types of drugs.

Playing the role as absolute king and having total control over my parliament, I would only instruct my parliament to move based on such criteria. There will always have to be a compromise between individual freedom and society itself, and honestly, that balance just very often tips towards society when discussing the banning of any drug. 

Just to cut to the chase: drugs like cocaine, heroin or GHB should never be legalised because of the health threats they pose to users and other associated (included criminal!) risks to society. To protect society at large, we have banned them with good reason. The same arguments can be used to ban other drugs in varying degrees. I think we could argue for weeks on end on the merits of banning cannabis based on the criteria above, and even then, I do not think we would quickly agree really. Over here, the political debate about it has been going on for *decades*, with little progress (even including the recent idea for the state to legalise the production of cannabis in a limited content). 

Looking back at what I said above, the elephant in the room is of course alcohol. But I do not consider the legal status of alcohol a good idea. It's merely on pragmatic grounds that I will double down on banning it (thus, I instruct my parliament to refrain from doing so, as the king likes his wine) - and that is enough for me. Also, decade long campaigns to warn people about using it could be utilized to limit use among the population, together with bans on using it in the public space.

4481,"&gt; While it's in fact illegal. Banning it doesn't seem to have the desired effects.

I doubt whether this is completely true. The war on drugs was succesful, but only partially. You suggest that banning does not have desired effects because it does not root out drug use in the first place. But that is not the point: the goal is to limit its use, and in that sense, the war on drugs was at least partially succesful. 

Edit: Just to clarify, I do not see it as a final solution in the end. 

&gt; Why do you want to prevent people from smoking weed and doing nothing all day if they want that?

That's actually the most important thing. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe it was the WHO (or some other international organisation, not sure) that has started to look at drugs use as a public health issue instead of just a criminal thing. 

The fact that people flee into drugs that get some fulfilled life reveals a serious fault in our own contemporary societies, that apparantly do not give people enough reason to enjoy life in a sober, non-drugged state.  That being said, being unproductive and possibly unemployed all day, such persons would only be a burden to society. 

Maybe we could let people smoke their brains out the day UBI arrives, but not before that. 

&gt; But by that logic we should also ban unhealthy food and make being fat illegal.

Well, about the former, I agree. We should. I've said for years we need to levy heavy, 300% taxes on unhealthy food just start out with.",Indifference is the best kind of tolerance /s.,/r/europe/comments/7oa9nx/california_legalises_cannabis_is_europe_next_the/ds8517m/,Parabellum8g,1515160598

Again, why stop at drugs why not at least consider banning other unproductive forms of entertaining yourself, and no we don't ban them to ""protect"" the society, that's beyond naive.

Weed isn't banned to protect anyone and cocaine in powder form granting much less punishment than in crack form (at least in the US) can maybe show you that these are complex things done for many different reasons.

The thing is you by trying to protect people actually put them in danger, you fuel the criminals and you force people to buy from them, cocaine really isn't the devil, no drug is, if they were all legal and cheap no one would be buying the flesh eating ones and just as there are no good junkies right now there would be then too, their chances of dying from some random bad batch would simply be eliminated alongside other things.

4576,"&gt;Right now the problem with nuclear is the price though. I read that there are very large subsidies for hinckley point, much larger than what new wind farms receive.

Hinkley point has been guaranteed a price of £92.50 per MWH. In the same round of funding, offshore wind farms were guaranteed prices of £130 - £160 per MWH. The wind farms are also intermittent and require backup and frequency management, at additional cost.

Last year some new offshore wind farms were approved using a competitive bidding process. The prices for those range between £57.50 and £74.50 per MWH. However, those prices are speculative, and there is no obligation on the winning bidders to actually deliver. Again the intermittent power will require extra subsidies paid for backup power and frequency management.

In other words, the most expensive nuclear plant ever built in the UK will, when the extra costs are taken into account, cost about the same as the cheapest wind plants ever built in Britain (assuming they are built at all). 

The government are already targeting a price of around £60 per MWH for future nuclear power plants. ",,/r/europe/comments/7o9xi8/yesterday_wind_produced_23_of_europes_electricity/ds816j2/,WhiteSatanicMills,1515153651

The law in question is certainly not really good, but it was prompted by the problem that companies like Facebook and Twitter simply pointed to the fact that they are not German and therefore don't need to adhere to German law and that their terms of use were good enough. (The law itself though isn't well enforcable, it states things like 'obviously unlawful content' so companies at the moment delete everything remotely offensive in order to avoid penalty.)

You don't go to jail in Germany for voicing unpopular opinions. You won't even go to jail for insulting people directly. You have to really push it to go to jail at all in Germany. What AfD people did lately was insult people in general (Twitter deleted it, Facebook did not) and call someone a ""half-nigger"" (pretty sure insulting a person directly can be prosecuted in pretty much every law system by the way).

What these AfD people are trying to do is raise their public profile again because lately nobody really cared for them directly anymore (people were still talking about migrants, but AfD didn't lead the charge).

4586,"That narrative would make more sense if the European Parliament hadn't voted for the first step to be taken. You know who did that voting? The representatives from all the member states.... They could have just voted how they wished to vote.

Then there's the simple fact that the commission went for it too. Commissioners are directly responsible to their home governments. If there were so many of those that didn't wish to trigger the article, one is again left wondering why they voted to do it. Do you think that member states are all scared into line to the extent that they stop having a say?

Finally there is the idea that Polish voting rights are a big deal. I don't think so. They have very little sway within the EU as is. The PiS party is in the eurosceptic grouping within the Parliament, not really one of the decision making groups shall we say. The Poles have so little influence that they failed to block Tusk's reappointment as council president, that while support from the home country of usually vital. The loss of voting rights would be like the loss of the right to be ignored. It won't change things. That's because the EU is exceptionally weak, it cannot force the Poles to reverse their trajectory, it cannot force the Poles to leave, it can only repeat that it disapproves ad nauseum.

Hungary, Poland, perhaps the rest of Visegrad, they will deal with their politics in their own way. In skilled hands the EU might adopt a policy that will drive the nationalists in Eastern Europe to voluntarily leave the EU, sparing us the deadlock of American style federation, but I doubt we'll get so lucky.

And what makes you think that we aren't worried at all? Because we don't agree with your racist views? Because we haven't already started to deport masses of people to somewhere, or whatever you think Germany should do to handle the situation? We are worried. We are just not racist about it.

4626,"&gt;Mr Orban pledged to defend Poland last month after the EU launched unprecedented “article 7” disciplinary proceedings against its government over a raft of new laws boosting political influence over the judiciary.

I think that the people here getting worked up should cool down a bit.  This is the core of the article.  It is not new.  It is not surprising.  It does not threaten the EU.

And more to the point, it is not specific to Poland.

If there were threats to A7 *any* member, they would similarly seek another state to block it.  That's part of the design of the thing.  The bar is intentionally high: stripping voting power is the most-extreme thing that can be done.  Unless it were overwhelmingly clear that the EU were threatened, I sincerely doubt that A7 would go through.

Let me throw another thought out there: I doubt that it is only Hungary's government that feels this way.

When a legislative vote is taken, only the number required to win need vote for the item.  For an unpopular ballot choice, anyone voting for something suffers loss of popularity.  It's better for legislators voting for something to coordinate and get no more than the minimum required, so as to not force legislators to take unpopular votes.

It may be that there are two, three, or fifteen countries that do not approve of A7 being used here.  But as long as Hungary is stepping up and credibly threatening a veto, they don't need to publicly state their position.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/7o9qhg/poland_and_hungary_set_to_reaffirm_stance_against/ds7y169/,vokegaf,1515145921

When something is an obvious continuation of existing policies in response to actual events, then the burden of proof that this is otherwise falls on you.

4720,"I agree with the first paragraph.

The second paragraf is, well, nonsense. Europe was plagued by wars in the last 500 years the same or even more than other continents. Thirty years war for example almost destroyed what is now Germany, for example. If anything, wars helped the progress (WW1 and WW2 are the most obvious example - or does anybody really think, that we would get to the moon, without the progress made in that area (flight) in both world wars?).

You are right, that there are many reasons for the success of Europe, but lack of wars (the same goes for diseases and famine) is definitely not one of them.

EDIT: Just a clarification, before people accuse me, that I said the wars are good. This is a difficult subject for sure, but it's pretty obvious, that in the past wars helped the progress in many ways, especially, if you had two somehow equal and technologically advanced opponents. Necessity is a mother of invention, and there are countless things, that for example ww1 and ww2 help invent or make better (world food production still relies on Fritz Haber's process, invented during ww1, for example). But obviously, not all wars help to speed the progress, obviously. Wars among tribes in Africa, fought with AKs and Hiluxes, advance nothing. Wars where world's most powerful countries smart bombs some mullahs in a cave, advance nothing (or very little).

4813,"TRANSLATION

The head of the SPD, Martin Schulz, threatened in an interview with Bild that Germany would limit its contributions to the future budget of the European Union if countries using funds such as Hungary and Poland would not help in solving the migration crisis.

""With the next EU multiannual budget prospects, Germany can not simply pay regular sums to the budget if recipient countries such as Hungary and Poland do not contribute to the reception of refugees, Schulz said.""

""We pay, we bear the costs associated with refugees, and some countries do not take refugees; they lead us by the nose. The EU is a community of law, not a supermarket, where everyone chooses what suits him - said the SPD chairman.""

Hungary and Poland, and recently also Austria ""avoid responsibility"" and act as if the refugee problem only concerned Germans - Schulz remarked.

Referring to the planned participation of Viktor Orban in the outgoing meeting of the Bavarian parliamentary group CSU on Friday at the Seeon monastery, Schulz expressed the hope that the host of the meeting - Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer will raise both the issue of refugee distribution, as well as freedom of speech and the media.

Seehofer defended yesterday the idea of ​​inviting Orban to a meeting in Seeon, stressing that the Prime Minister of Hungary is a democratically elected head of government. Defending himself against criticism, he also stressed that there is no doubt that the Hungarian politician adheres to the principles of the rule of law.

Seehofer stressed that the EU should show less pride when assessing other countries.

The Bavarian CSU and Fidesz Orban, like the German Chancellor Angela Merkel's CDU, belong to the European People's Party.

On Friday, Orban will be the guest of the CSU's external meeting, which during the two-day meeting is to establish a strategy for interviews with the CDU and SPD on the formation of the coalition government of Germany.

The head of the SPD, Martin Schulz, threatened in an interview with Bild that Germany would limit its contributions to the future budget of the European Union if countries using funds such as Hungary and Poland would not help in solving the migration crisis.

""With the next EU multiannual budget prospects, Germany can not simply pay regular sums to the budget if recipient countries such as Hungary and Poland do not contribute to the reception of refugees, Schulz said.""

""We pay, we bear the costs associated with refugees, and some countries do not take refugees; they lead us by the nose. The EU is a community of law, not a supermarket, where everyone chooses what suits him - said the SPD chairman.""

Hungary and Poland, and recently also Austria ""avoid responsibility"" and act as if the refugee problem only concerned Germans - Schulz remarked.

Referring to the planned participation of Viktor Orban in the outgoing meeting of the Bavarian parliamentary group CSU on Friday at the Seeon monastery, Schulz expressed the hope that the host of the meeting - Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer will raise both the issue of refugee distribution, as well as freedom of speech and the media.

Seehofer defended yesterday the idea of ​​inviting Orban to a meeting in Seeon, stressing that the Prime Minister of Hungary is a democratically elected head of government. Defending himself against criticism, he also stressed that there is no doubt that the Hungarian politician adheres to the principles of the rule of law.

Seehofer stressed that the EU should show less pride when assessing other countries.

The Bavarian CSU and Fidesz Orban, like the German Chancellor Angela Merkel's CDU, belong to the European People's Party.

On Friday, Orban will be the guest of the CSU's external meeting, which during the two-day meeting is to establish a strategy for interviews with the CDU and SPD on the formation of the coalition government of Germany.

&gt; Later on, once it became clear that studies showed it didn't cause cancer, the EU CHANGED ITS RATIONALE

The article you cite does not say what you think it says. See, that's the problem with googling something that you don't really understand: you get an incomplete and frequently inaccurate picture. The NPR article/broadcast focused on the one aspect that affected America, without doing a deep dive of the background. Here's what actually happened.

1. The 1990s saw a series of food safety incidents in the EU.
2. As a result, the EU decided to do a complete overhaul of its food safety policy (which eventually culminated in the General Food Law Regulation).
3. This regulation targeted intra-EU food producers and trade. It established the ""farm-to-fork"" principle, where every link in the food production chain is subject to the relevant production and trade standards, not just the final product.
4. In order to prevent circumvention (by importing from or exporting to third countries), imports and exports are also subject to at least equivalent standards.
5. Calling it a protectionist measure is ... odd. It primarily created compliance costs for EU businesses; American imports got caught up in it, but a huge chunk of the burden fell on EU producers and trade.
6. The chlorination process was banned at the same time for a number of reasons, and again first and foremost for EU businesses. It was part of the same overhaul that led to modern EU food law.
7. The EU uses the precautionary principle (now enshrined in Article 191 TFEU) to evaluate threats to human health (and also the environment and natural resources), which roughly means to ""err on the side of caution if there is doubt.""
8. The precautionary principle is an outgrowth of harmonizing laws across EU member states; health and the environment are sensitive areas where member states do not want to be subject to a majority in the Parliament and Council legislating rules that they find unacceptable. Therefore, such legislation is further constrained by a ""better safe than sorry"" standard. While this sometimes leads to unnecessarily restrictive results (such as in the case of GMOs), this is the price of allowing the EU to legislate in these areas.
9. That the cancer concerns were later found to be overblown didn't change the rest of the food safety overhaul. Farm-to-fork is still at the [core of food safety legislation](https://ec.europa.eu/food/overview_en), and legislation concerning farm animal welfare has been improved in lockstep (going back to Council Directive 98/58/EC in 1998).

&gt; The fact of the matter is that the ECJ would never strike down a piece of EU legislation for lack of animal welfare or make a court ruling forcing the EU to adopt a specific policy. Those are political decisions and the vague words about animal welfare in the EU treaties are meaningless. It is style over substance for you to insinuate otherwise.

Am I understanding you right that you want the EU Commission to ignore a clear mandate in the treaties in the hope that the ECJ will not overturn it and that the European Parliament and the Council of the EU will agree to that? I'm sorry, but you're just not realistic here. Such a brazen attempt to ignore treaty mandates would put the entire treaty structure at risk. Nobody on this side of the Atlantic shares Grover Norquist's fantasy of making the government so small that you can drown it in a bathtub. They may think that individual regulations are bad or that there's too much regulation, but nobody wants to screw with the basic principles. ""Pacta sunt servanda"" and all that.

See, that's the problem with libertarians (and communists, and other radical philosopies). They consider their ideological convictions more important than laws and norms, because other people in their opinion just don't know what's good for them. But most normal people consider that crazy; if you don't like laws and treaties in a democracy, you move to amend them, assuming you can find a majority; you don't try to violate or bypass them.",Migrant,/r/europe/comments/7o3ywc/stop_saying_american_chicken_isnt_safe_to_eat_us/ds7srea/,dances_with_unicorns,1515134227

&gt; 
&gt; 

I could do the same (excluding the pumpking oil salad) (and including multiple more dishes) in both Austria and Hungary. Yet I don't feel any special connection towards them. 

I'm not claiming Slovenia is more similar to Cro and Srb, but that insane bond of similarity between Austria and Slovenia some users here mention, I simply don't see it.

And even by cuisine, central Croatia is far more similar than Austria is, again, IMO.

&gt; I actually have a MSc in Economics

Apparently you forgot to take a course on the history of economic thought. If you had done so you would know that the extent to which Maths is used in economics nowadays is a pretty recent invention. In the context of 19th century economics Marx was a very solid thinker.  

&gt; he was great at describing the faults of a free market economy, but he didn't have a clue about how an economy works  

This statement is a contradiction in itself.

5015,"It has nothing to do with ""whom you love"". You don't have a right to marry ""whom you love""; for one the person ""whom you love"" also needs to want to marry _you_.

A lack of same-sex marriage is not discrimination based on orientation; it's discrimination based on _sex_. It gives males different rights from females.

The argument that it's not discrimination based on orientation is completely correct; it just neglects to answer that it's discrimination based on sex.

""everyone has the same rights"" has never meant ""everyone gets to do what they want""; it doesn't and hasn't gone like that ever. Via that argument you can for instance say ""We should make drugs legal because it's not far that the people that like to do drugs don't get what they want but the people who like to drink lemonade do.""; it has always meant ""everyone gets the _same_ rights"" and if the rights you get are not rights you want or need then it's useless to you, yes, but anything else is completely unimplementable as a general principle.

Then you can see that the situations are not comparable. Segregation literally defined different rights based on specific criteria for different people.

&gt; Don't you think being forced to chose between marrying someone you don't love (like you said, they can marry a man if they want to...) or not marrying at all is a lesser quality of choice than simply being able to marry who you love?

Everyone has the right to remain unmarried, and they are exercising that right. 

If the issue is about sharing wealth in the way that married couples do, I don't have anything against even two friends signing such a contract, it's none of anyone's business how people handle their household anyway (as long as taxes are being paid and social obligations are fulfilled).

&gt; And where do you draw the line? If the society decides they want them out of the country, you also agree with it? And what if the society decides they want to do worse, like in Chechnya?

5023,"You make some good points, and I think we mostly agree. Again, in general, one of the main problems with positive discrimination on racial grounds is that racial discrimination can be quite difficult to measure or quantify on an individual scale - if we take progressive taxation as an example, income can be measured (relatively) easily and entirely individually, so a policy can make moral sense individually as well as in the abstract. When, as you suggested, measures to advantage black people place a rich person over a poor one, that's very obviously a moral injustice, and a failure of policy. 

In all positive discrimination, we end up having to choose which types of advantage we do consider, and which we don't. That might mean focusing on race, or on gender, or on background, but it necessarily places some narratives of inequality over others. This, basic, problem - the moral impossibility of designing an effective redistributive policy on any large scale - can be quite disheartening, but positive discrimination can still have a legitimate place among policies, we just have to choose carefully where we use it, and how we apply it - using a nuanced mix of social, economics, and other factors to maximise fairness. Positive discrimination can still make sense on a large scale, even if it doesn't on a small one.

&gt; A system of government by the whole population or all the eligible members of a state, typically through elected representatives.

This seems to be a common trend with _many_ words  where the usage does not match the dictionary definition even in dictionaries that claim to be descriptive because the point is that if you ask people on the street what the word means they will say something like the above but that's often not how they use it due to conflation and they aren't even aware of it.

We had a rather interesting discussion on r/askreddit about the word ""indigenous"" a couple of days back pointing out that the word is seldom used in its dictionary definition and essentially any population that is technologically advanced will never be called ""indigenous"" even if they are the indigenous population by the dictionary definition. That's just the association people have with the word: people that more or less live in a primitive and traditional way that don't build skyscrapers or train networks because that's how it's often used.

The German welfare state, then the most conprehensive welfare state in the world, was established in the 1880s by the conservative Bismarck and opposed by socialists because it made their ideology somewhat obsolete. Part of the reason he did it.

&gt;Under Bismarck, Germany was a world innovator in building the welfare state. German workers enjoyed health, accident and maternity benefits, canteens, changing rooms and a national pension scheme

Belgium began in 1894:

&gt;Nevertheless, Belgium created a welfare net particularly early, thanks in part to the trade unions. Sickness compensation was established in 1894, voluntary old-age insurance in 1900 and unemployment insurance in 1907, achieving good coverage nationwide much more quickly than its neighbours.

Britain established their welfare state in the decade leading up to WWI.

France was slower and stingier than the others, but still got underway before the war.

&gt;France lagged behind Bismarckian Germany, as well as Great Britain, in developing a welfare state with public health, unemployment insurance and national old age pension plans. There was an accident insurance law for workers in 1898, and in 1910, France created a national pension plan.

Spain was a shitshow lurching from crisis to crisis following the Peninsular War and independence of her colonies, but nonetheless started introducing welfare in 1883.

America did it much later, in response to the Great Depression.

5090,"I mostly agree, but I am still of mind that the issue that US faces are social, disguisted as racial.

As an example, look at Asian community. If we want to talk historical perspective, 70 years ago asian were summarily locked in military-ran camps and labelled enemies because of Pearl Harbour. This mindset continued for decades after war until it finally went away and Vietnamese Hmongs who ran away from communists were labelled by much of society as, enemies again because vietnamese = vietnamese in many peoples eyes.

Per capita today they earn most of any race and ear most degrees of any race.  Now we can say that asian capitalistic culture made them ideal for US competitive system, and we would be largely correct. But we also have to look at social background they came in. While latino and hispanic immigrants from other parts of Americans are often arriving as poor and as a result ending up in poor neighbourhoods, blacks were historically segregated into poor neighbourhoods, that defined their family social status. Therefore I see it as social problem first, and racial as 100th as can be easily proved by looking at 1st and 2nd generation migrants from Africa that are socially extremely well off as they came via Green Card system that required all of those migrants to be highly educated and therefore on top of social ladder, while rooting out those that were not. And yet their status is much different, despite being black just as AfricanAmericans whose ancestors were slaves.

So using racial profiling increses the hit-and-miss chance of actual helping, while social profiling would help those who need it and leave those that dont need help to their own device. But US is race obsses and afraid to ever tackle the poverty problem, so wont happen. In Europe, we should be smarter about it. We can already see the bad effects it all has in UK where white boys from working class are least likely from any group to get accepted to uni because the positive discrimination discarded them on account of being white, ignoring that their families dont live wealthy life at all.",Slovakia,/r/europe/comments/7o02fb/white_working_class_boys_left_behind_because_of/ds7gsgg/,Niikopol,1515118124

How is it not practical? How is it any less practical than classifying people by religion? How does someone's race tell you any less about someone than their religion? 

Saying that someone is Christian, for example, doesn't tell you anything. They could be any type of christian. They could be African, Latin-American, Scandinavian, or Italian. It's completely impractical to classify people by their religion because that could mean anything. It's way more practical to just directly describe people as African, Latin-American, or whatever.

This includes 2–3 million indigenous Romanians living in neighbouring states such as Ukraine, Hungary, Serbia, Bulgaria, the Balkans and especially the Republic of Moldova. The number also includes circa 2.7–3.5 million Romanians in Western Europe.[2]

Article 263 TFEU gives the ECJ broad powers of judicial review over pretty much any and all acts of the EU institutions, not just legislation. And it can review legislation, too; so, if legislation does not take adequate care of animal welfare, it can be voided under Article 264 TFEU

Pray tell, please name one example when this has ever happened? When has the EU ever struck down an EU directive or regulation for not ""adequately taking care of animal welfare""?

At last count in 2005 (just before disarmament) the IRA was deemed to have 1500 members (high end estimate). The IRA was then formally disarmed, and has been inactive since.


To put it bluntly: if you do not achieve your primary objective of annexing Northern Ireland, and you agree to disarm according to your opponents wishes, and your leadership were all informing on you for years and in some cases decades, and also you have no members, then that sounds a hell of a lot like defeat.

Netherlands, Sweden and Finland altogether lack constitutional review by the way—Sweden has it on paper in exceptional circumstances but to this day no court has used it. Netherlands and Finland outright lack it by the design; Finland by tradition and Netherlands quite explicitly where the constitution is explicit about that judges are not to judge the constitutionality of laws.

Seems extremely frightening from the perspective of many but this is by design to stop the courts from enacting microlegislation; the upper house in the Netherlands judges the constitutionality of laws but just obeys the party whip  so it means nothing in the end so the result is that you get the exact same situation: the text of the constitution is irrelevant and it's all personal political opinion but with one important distinction and that's that it's _democratic_ personal political opinion rather than the opinion of a select group of people who are accountable to no one and can't be voted away.",The European flag is phallic as seen from above.,/r/europe/comments/7o02fb/white_working_class_boys_left_behind_because_of/ds7a0lr/,alaplaceducalife,1515110550

5230,"Ah yes, the old ""let the market decide"" argument. Except it's an oversimplification. Let me see if I can persuade you:

- Often people don't get a choice or know what the origin of the meat they're eating is. When you eat at restaurants, buy ready-meals, takeaways, canteens, etc.

- Many won't know about the bad welfare practices of the American poultry industry and would unwittingly buy it. As has been proven countless times by other programmes, no matter how hard you try, a very large proportion of people will not look or not know. In all honesty, even as someone who is attuned to these things, I don't inspect the country of origin for every item I buy when shopping -- almost nobody has the time or energy for that.

- Price is usually the main driver in immediate decision-making, even against people's better instincts (with exceptions usually only in extreme circumstances). 

  So, the American producers know that if they can get into the market they'll probably dominate it. 

  This will likely have the effect of driving currently compliant producers out of the market; making product that meets today's very modest standards more expensive, and those that survive forced to lower their standards to compete.

That's not something most people in this country want, and hence why we want regulation to set the **baseline** of what is acceptable in UK. The same goes for prophylactic antibiotic use in feed.

5254,"Why do you keep inserting environmental issues into an argument about automation tax? I'm not opposed to efforts to fix those problems, but it's pretty far off topic. Technology certainly contributed to the problem for a long time but now technology is being used quite successfully to begin reversing some of these problems. As a scientist in training, how much experience do you have with all aspects of automation going on in various businesses and organizations? In my own job experience I witness automation happening in little incremental steps everywhere. And as it happens we do work a bit differently so it's really hard to measure and compare what exactly is due to automation. Take email for example. It's clearly automated compared to letter mail but it also led to people sending way more messages, so you can't just treat 1 email as 1 letter when trying to figure out how much to tax.

It's also completely unnecessary to try this. If companies start to save tons of labor cost thanks to automation and increases profits then you can go after that money with already tried and tested taxes. You can increase taxes on the rich. You don't need to try to figure out how much of it was due to automation.",,/r/europe/comments/7o2cqx/installed_industrial_robots_per_10000_employees/ds73u1s/,MasterBerter,1515103083

5260,"An economist who didn't use a single number or equation in his arguments? Let's not kid ourselves: he was great at describing the faults of a free market economy, but he didn't have a clue about how an economy works. He didnt really add anything useful to the discipline of economics.

I will probably collect a few downvotes for that but it needs to be said. (Yes, I read Marx and I actually have a MSc in Economics)

Edit: I think I need to add some things: 

With ""the faults of a free market system"" I meant he social disparities causes by unhinged capitalism. This kind of criticism obviously takes up the lion share of *Das Kapital*. 

Why did he lose his relevance? He pretty much criticised the school of thought of classical liberalism. Because of Keynianism and Ordoliberalism this school has close to no relevance today. A lot of his own more technical theories about how an economy works (most notably the tendency of the rate of profit to fall) have been refuted.  

Another thing: it's true that people like Smith, Ricardo and Mill also were far away from the evidence-based economics of today. Because of that not only Marx but  Smith and Mill as well are widely regarded as philosophers. The transition wasn't as clear as it is today. In fact not only has Marx been widely refuted, many classical liberal theories have also been refuted by mainstream economics. My name shouldn't be misunderstood as a praisal of Smith (or Friedman).

5394,"&gt; They are called in Romanian ""pemi"" which comes from ""boemi""

Mind blown! This is the first time I hear the Banat Czechs referred to as *pemi*, in my ignorance I thought that the word *pemi* only describes the German settlers from Bohemia that were brought over by boat by the Empire and promised two oxen and a cart and a piece of land where they could practise agriculture. When they arrived there were no oxen and no carts, and the land was actually in the forested Banat mountains, completely unsuitable for agriculture (other than maybe potatoes). 

They were given axes and got to work - they started deforesting the region and had really hard lives, but adapted to their new lifestyle nonetheless as they couldn't really afford to go back where they came from.

However they never really integrated into society, or learned the language or the customs (partly due to the fact that they were somewhat geographically isolated) and kept to themselves. In the 1970s they started emigrating to Germany, the vast majority settling in Traunstein in Bavaria. They would generally refuse to sell their houses to Romanians, the only exception being doctors since they had no doctors of their own and over the years many succumbed to disease. 

After 1990 at least one village ([Lindenfeld](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindenfeld_\(Buchin\))) became deserted, and others became vacation villages and still are to this day. If you go to Gărâna ([Wolfsberg](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfsberg_\(Weidenthal\))) or Brebu Nou ([Weidenthal](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weidenthal_\(Kreis_Cara%C8%99-Severin\))) in the summer time you'll still meet a lot of the pemi who come to their *Heimat* on vacation. 

**TL;DR** Up until now I've only heard *pemi* describe the German settlers in the Banat Mountains, another really tiny minority in Romania.

5439,"Franco-Belgian, Italian and Spanish comics definitely aren't the same, but as the author wants to point people to these interesting comics that aren't American or manga, it's just convenient to refer to them as European comics. The differences between the countries could've been made more clear, but the article doesn't claim that these comic cultures are all the same. So I don't see any harm in grouping them together.

Dutch and English indeed, I have managed to read some Disney comics in German though. And thanks, interesting to learn a bit about comics in Portugal. And do you mean that before the recent popularity of superheroes the comics were only available in Brazilian Portuguese, and now they're in European Portuguese as well? Or do you mean that nowadays stores import the English versions of the comics? Hm, and it looks like I would enjoy those adventures by Dog Mendonça e Pizzaboy.

I don't know how much exactly you would like to know about [Dutch comics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_comics), and if you'd be interested in reading some. I'm sometimes surprised myself about what's translated. Anyway, the Paste Magazine article mentioned Joost Swarte, whose comics aren't actually that well-known here. Some of the classics here in the Netherlands are the text comic *Tom Poes* by Marten Toonder, several comics by Hans G. Kresse (his series about Native Americans was a success in France), the British-Dutch sci-fi/fantasy series *Storm* by Don Lawrence, *Agent 327* by Martin Lodewijk, *Franka* by Henk Kuijpers, and the fairy-tale-ish *Douwe Dabbert* by Piet Wijn and Thom Roep. A bit more modern are two of my personal favorites, *Dirkjan* by Mark Retera, a popular Far Side-inspired gag-a-day comic, and *Gilles de Geus* by Hanco Kolk and Peter de Wit, which has been called the Dutch Asterix.

Constitutional principles are useless; constitutions say whatever the courts say they say and they constantly come with far-fetched explanations based on what they want to be true that have nothing to do with facts or the letter of the constitution and that's pretty much by design.

They say it's about ""the constitution"" to keep people docile, to offer them the illusion that their rights are based on some objective document rather than the random whims of a group of people so they won't revolt; in reality people who design states know damned well that that won't work because values change all the time so if you make constitutions clear rather than ultra-vague they will be dated in 50 years but people really like to believe that things like ""timeless values"" exist which don't.

The solution is to make constitutions so utterly vague that you can divine from it whatever you want and that's what courts do—it's all their own personal opinion really.

The US supreme court says there is a constitutional right to same sex marriage; hey I happen to like same sex marriage but reading the US constitution it doesn't even ban discrimination of any form whatsoever and doesn't ban discrimination based on sex; there is no constitutional right to same sex marriage in the US and if there was then why can only 5 of the 4 justices see it? Why did it take till 2015 while the constituion hasn't been changed in 60 years? Why was it rejected when the same challenged was brought a mere 8 years earlier?

The German constitution _does_ ban discrimination based on sex; it flat out says ""males and females shall have equal rights"" yet Germany has male-only conscription which the German Federal Constitutional Court ruled to not violate the constitution searching _really_ hard to find an argument for it.

The other point is that they need to maintain authority; the thing is that if the Federal Constitutional Court just said ""It's not constitutional"" (which it isn't) then a big chance is that people would just ignore it and they would continue to do it regardless the ruling because they really want it and then you have a problem because when it happens _once_ that a ruling of the constitutional court is just flat disobeyed the court loses _a lot_ of authority and there's a crisis at hand and they know this.",The European flag is phallic as seen from above.,/r/europe/comments/7o02fb/white_working_class_boys_left_behind_because_of/ds6qyis/,alaplaceducalife,1515088398

5625,"&gt;Where was Labour when the white working class where screaming for immigration controls?

The advantage of electing representatives is that you can filter out the screaming and do something about the problem that causes the screaming, rather than just joining in the witch hunt for the scapegoat.

&gt;Where was Labour when the white working class were priced out of London due to an influx of minorities?

That's bullshit, they were priced out of London by rampant real estate speculation spurred on by the financial sector and the relentless centralization policy of the English state during centuries.

&gt;Where was Labour when white working class boys started to fall behind 50 years ago? 

8 January – the Prime Minister, Harold Wilson (Labour), endorses the 'I'm Backing Britain' campaign, encouraging workers to work extra time without pay or take other actions to help competitiveness, which is spreading across Britain.[3]

1 March
    Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1968 further reduces right of entry for citizens from the British Commonwealth to the U.K.

Curiously, it's also the year of Enoch Powell's [Rivers of Blood speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rivers_of_Blood_speech#Speech):

&gt;Powell recounted a conversation with one of his constituents, a middle-aged working man, a few weeks earlier. Powell said that the man told him: ""If I had the money to go, I wouldn't stay in this country… I have three children, all of them been through grammar school and two of them married now, with family. I shan't be satisfied till I have seen them all settled overseas."" The man finished by saying to Powell: ""In this country in 15 or 20 years' time the black man will have the whip hand over the white man.""[6]

We're now 50 years later. Does the black man have the whip hand over the white man in the UK? (Note the irony of emigrating while complaining about immigrants)

&gt;As I look ahead, I am filled with foreboding. Like the Roman, I seem to see ""the River Tiber foaming with much blood"". That tragic and intractable phenomenon which we watch with horror on the other side of the Atlantic but which there is interwoven with the history and existence of the States itself, is coming upon us here by our own volition and our own neglect. Indeed, it has all but come. In numerical terms, it will be of American proportions long before the end of the century. 

Do you think that the presence of people that visibly descend from other continents is ""a tragic and intractable phenomenon""?

Even though Germany has a unique history with Nazism, the neo-nazi parties are not only allowed, they also run for elections. You know why they dont ban them? They've tried a few times, but the courts always deny that. Because it is unconstitutional and undemocratic. Democracy doesnt just entail; ""You can vote.""

Democracy also looks at the fundamentals of the RIGHT to vote. If you ban parties, albeit a majority calls for it, then you take away the voice of those parties. So even though the majority wants to act batshit insane, a democracy protects the right for EVERYBODY to be heard. Even nazis.

Both men and women get parental leaves over here. If you're tight on cash, whoever is earning less is likely to take a longer leave. The better educated a mother is, the more likely her husband is to take a longer leave. Women are slowly but surely becoming better educated than men here in Iceland.

&gt; ... and also more likely to quit the job to raise children.

Not in Iceland. Quitting your job to raise your children is literally looked down upon here in Iceland. I don't know a single woman of my generation or younger (I'm in my mid 30s) who even downgrades to a part time job after having children. Why would they? We've got a strong daycare system here.

&gt; Women also retire on average 2 years earlier.

100% irrelevant, unless you're hiring someone in their late 60s. You never expect someone to stay with your company for decades. Most people who want to stay that long have little ambition anyway, so unlikely to be stellar employees.

You're spewing idealistic nonsense here. Look at the internet infrastructure here in Iceland. Built up by the municipalities. 80% of the population now has access to 1 Gbit/s fiber optic connections.

I agree that we have too much gun violence and crime in general but you are doing what you can to close that gap.  As for control of private data, yes European countries do tend to control private data more.  As for customer service i would say the US is way ahead there and my internet speed is likely as god as yours and I can see two different cell phone towers from my window and no I don't live in a city.  As for health care, agreed there is a range of situations but I have three prescriptions and only pay  a few dollars a month for them.  I live near Canada and they have cheaper heath care when they can get it but more of them come here for heath care than Americans go there.  As for food, again there is diversity.  It is easy to get cheap and unhealthy food but for a little more you can as many get fresh and healthy options as you want.  I routinely buy produce straight from farms and just yesterday I bought fresh raw unhomogenized milk at a farm that came out of the cow yesterday.

The thing to understand about America is that it is a very large and diverse country that values individualism and freedom.  However, yes the freedom to succeed also involves the freedom to fail.  Anything you look for in America good or bad you can find.  How individualism works is you get to decide what you want in your life and you seek that out.  However, yes some people don't really realize that and end up making poor choices.

5798,"Oh Berlin. What is Berlin? Berlin is the city that makes Germans feel ashamed on the international stage. If you compare Berlin to other European capitals like London, Paris, Madrid and Amsterdam, every upstanding German will blush from embarrassment. Even small countries like Austria, Belgium or Switzerland have presentable capitals with a great standard of living such as Vienna, Brussels or Zürich. Germany, however, is saddled with Berlin, the capital of losers. Berlin is – by a long margin – the German city that is home to the greatest number of assholes. German Rail, the German Parliament, Air Berlin and the Axel Springer publishing house are just a few examples for the incompetent kind of scum harbored by this city. The glory times are long gone, the city has hit rock bottom. The typical Berliner is a lazy bastard. Character traits that are considered dead give aways for laziness, coldness, incompetence, dissocial personality disorder and idiocy in more civilized cultures, are a source of pride for Berliners. Another central feature of the Berliner's psyche is an extreme inferiority complex. That's why Berliners project massive feelings of hate on everyone that is in some way better than themselves. The Southern Germans – superior to the Berliner in all aspects of life – are a thorn in their side. They envy the Southerners' success and Munich is the city that is most heavily despised, because that city is everything and has everything that Berlin can only dream of. The fact that the Berliners' antisocial existence is only financed by the Munichers is irrelevant. The Berliners believe that this is their god given birth right. The Berliners wallow in their parasite-like existence and praise their supposed global city, instead of fighting the lethargy that comes about as a result of their envy and jealousy by sprucing up their community. In terms of cultural life, there is nothing noteworthy about Berlin. The era of great works is long past, so the Berliners consider something as trivial as the pronunciation of the letter “g“ with a “y” sound as a great cultural achievement. Advanced learners even know how to add a “wa?” (the German equivalent to the Canadian ""eh?”, just more trashy) at the end of each sentence. The culinary traditions of Berlin are not worth mentioning. A sausage made from mechanically reclaimed meat with ketchup and curry spice is sold as a “Currywurst” and considered a culinary stroke of genius. No sane human being would ever see a sausage slathered with ketchup as the holy grail of the art of cooking – hell, most wouldn't even consider it a proper dish. But in their magnanimity, the rest of Germany lets the Berliners hang on to their delution so as to not increase their inferiority complex any further. Berlin is an economic disaster at a scale that makes even the old socialist GDR look good. If the universities are to be believed, the economy of Berlin is based on “alternative” blogs, something something about media and gender studies. Despite its dire financial situation, Berlin indulges in prestigious projects such as the rebuilding of the downtown chateau and an airport that should be seen as an art project due to its utter lack of functionality. At the same time, Berlin is home to the headquarters of all major parties, which should all be seen as traitors to the people and haven't added this to their official names only for marketing reasons. The lord mayor of the city was for a long time the oh-so-funny WowiBear (Klaus Peter Wowereit), who doomed every even somewhat presentable aspect of the city with his “Prestige and Prosecco” style of politics. To put it in a nutshell: Berlin is the trailer park of Germany. Berlin is to Germany what Greece is for the European Union. And if Berlin had open sewage, it would be the Romania of Germany. Berlin is a mark of shame, a zit on the ass of Germany. Berlin is the guy who turns up to your party without an invitation, who doesn't even bring alcohol, and who doesn't get that he isn't welcome even if you clobber him up until he loses some teeth and push him down the stairs. Berlin is the Detroit of Germany and should be sold to Poland for 200 Złoty.",Albanian/Dutchie,/r/europe/comments/7o27dy/come_here_to_get_your_countryregion_roasted/ds69xm0/,Ealt,1515067080

Unless this trend can be stopped and reversed, violent crime could very well increase past the peak in 2007.

This would be less of an issue if the increase in crime was the only factor at play. Unfortunately, the costs of integrating, assimilating, employing and housing such a large amount of people will require diverting resources and funds from other areas in need - i.e. infrastructure, healthcare, social services, police, homeless and so on. This will inevitably causes strain on Germany and Sweden, the same as it would any other country.

Edit: It is far from an apocalypic wasteland here, but it would be a stretch to call the effects that this has already had on Sweden marginal. ",Sweden,/r/europe/comments/7ntjmn/germany_study_links_increased_crime_rate_to/ds676wb/,Eccenter,1515060483

5894,"I’ll try to give an informative answer.

This new law isn’t exactly a “hate speech” law, but more of a blocking law. The hate speech laws already exist for decades in Germany. Stuff like “Volksverhetzung” which punishes stirring up hate and calling for violence against minorities.

The “Problem” which our government saw, was that the hate speech laws often don’t come into effect in cases of Volksverhetzung etc. in the Internet. At the same time, the cases of hate speech in the net did rise during the last years. So we have a growing gap of cases which apply to a existing law, but aren’t punished.

The new blocking law (Netzwerkdurchsetzungsgesetz) tries to close this gap.

However, by punishing websites if the don’t comply with the law and due to missing punishments when websites “overblock”, things like OPs post happen. Furthermore, the companies will try to comply with this law without spending to much money, so I bet they’ll mostly use algorithms. Since it is needed to know the context when interpreting hate speech laws, these will often fail.

Apparently the government thought that the overblocking problem isn’t that big, or that it’s worth it.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/7nvsfb/german_hate_speech_law_tested_as_twitter_blocks/ds677p3/,Bananenhannes,1515060538

not really, democraxy only really kick startrd in the 1850s after the goldrush boom in victoria (which saw the colony leap from 50,000 to 500,000 in a decade). what did happen was the Eureka stockade riots, and the subsequent adoption of voting rights for all men of majority age.

resource extraction has always been a a major part of Australia's economy, as our colonisation by the British was just before the industrial revolution, and hence a lot of the coal to run that came from Australia.

The main difference is we were apart of the British democratic traditions which are much older.

5977,"Is your point that the negative effects of taking in more migrants and refugees than can be effectively assimilated and integrated to society are non-issues, because Bulgaria is so poor that it ""can't get worse""? For obvious reasons poorer countries have a significantly lower ability (than Germany, in this case) to cope with the negative effects and additional costs associated with large-scale immigration. As you said, they already have enough problems as it is - but it can always get worse. 

That said, costs are costs and a negative trend is negative; it doesn't matter how rich or great everything has been in Germany - the point is that it's getting worse in many areas. To any reasonably unbiased and rational person, it should be easy to see why this is considered undesirable by so many people - even if you personally don't.

""Residents of the Northwest organize a collection of signatures for separating Vidin, Vratsa and Montana from Bulgaria. They say they want to join Romania, Nova TV reported.

The organizer of the protest and initiator of the collection Boris Kamenov explained that one of his motives for the initiative is for the region to save itself from corruption in Bulgaria.

""We should not be part of this corruption,"" Kamenov said.

He thinks people in the Northwest are known to have a fighting spirit. He recalled how the population of his native region organized the Chiprovian uprising against the Ottoman Empire, as well as the so-called September uprising in 1923, and that they have always fought for ""true democracy.""

Asked why the Northwest wants to become part of Romania, Kamenov pointed out without hesitation the more effective Romanian judicial system and the fight against corruption in our northern neighbor.

""Their judiciary is much more democratic and reformed,"" he said. ""
