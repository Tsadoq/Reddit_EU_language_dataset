Any freedom is given by human society. Nature doesnt give any rights, only forcs you to try and survive or die.

So, freedom of speech is an ”art”. A form of dialogue where your opinion is not valued by itself but how well you present your argument. 

Now this opens up a pandoras box in itself and the reason why we have the legal clusterfuck on speech now when different cultural ideas about speech is being introduced in liberal western nations.

34,"&gt; You are arguing from your stand-point. Not the objective legality of it.

There is no objective definition of what constitutes a nation-state, but when 2/3 of nations and the UN recognizes it as a sovereign state - then it's not correct to say it's not recognized as an independent nation. You can say that it's not universally recognized, sure. But that's a very different thing.

&gt; If Palestine never gets the ”territory” you proclaim. There will never be a state to recognize and thus there is no inherent state to recognize right?

Whether or not they have control over any territory - I don't see why you would put that word in scare quotes - is actually not super relevant as to whether the state is recognized.

62,"The term ""vegan"" was coined by The Vegan Society. They define it as:

&gt;Veganism is a way of living that seeks to exclude, as far as possible and practicable, all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing and any other purpose.

The same definition can be found in the sidebar of /r/vegan.

Every parent who breastfeeds is feeding their child a vegan diet. There is a reason why every major dietetic organization in the world agrees that appropriately planned vegetarian and vegan diets are healthy for all stages of life.

**[Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27886704/)**

* *It is the position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics that appropriately planned vegetarian, including vegan, diets are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits for the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. These diets are appropriate for all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, adolescence, older adulthood, and for athletes.*

**[Dietitians of Canada](https://www.dietitians.ca/Downloads/Factsheets/Guidlines-for-Vegans.aspx)**

* *A healthy vegan diet can meet all your nutrient needs at any stage of life including when you are pregnant, breastfeeding or for older adults.*

**[The British National Health Service](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Vegetarianhealth/Pages/Vegandiets.aspx)**

* *With good planning and an understanding of what makes up a healthy, balanced vegan diet, you can get all the nutrients your body needs.*

**[The British Nutrition Foundation](http://www.nutrition.org.uk/publications/briefingpapers/vegetarian-nutrition)**

* *A well-planned, balanced vegetarian or vegan diet can be nutritionally adequate ... Studies of UK vegetarian and vegan children have revealed that their growth and development are within the normal range.*

**[Dietitians Association of Australial](https://daa.asn.au/smart-eating-for-you/smart-eating-fast-facts/healthy-eating/vegan-diets-facts-tips-and-considerations/)**

* *Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. With planning, those following a vegan diet can cover all their nutrient bases, but there are some extra things to consider.*

**[Harvard Medical School](http://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/becoming-a-vegetarian)**

* *Traditionally, research into vegetarianism focused mainly on potential nutritional deficiencies, but in recent years, the pendulum has swung the other way, and studies are confirming the health benefits of meat-free eating. Nowadays, plant-based eating is recognized as not only nutritionally sufficient but also as a way to reduce the risk for many chronic illnesses.*",,/r/europe/comments/bqbtme/parents_who_raise_children_as_vegans_should_be/eo3apzh/,lnfinity,1558238344

The full length of the meeting is documented in the video, sober viewing that raises deep moral questions, both political and otherwise. More than six hours that covered not only backroom deals, but also the overarching goal of creating a tamed Austrian media landscape similar to the Hungarian model. It also covered such gossip as which high-ranking politician is homosexual and which one does cocaine and where he gets it. The video provides a glimpse into the small world of Viennese politics.""",Luxembourg,/r/europe/comments/bq4p1g/caught_in_the_trap_heinzchristian_strache_the/eo2jvvc/,JackRogers3,1558222752

380,"I don't think ""lugimirant"" is an English word but i get the gist of what you're saying.

I would usually agree with you but i felt that the refugee crisis was by far the most important issue during that time. Im not actually against taking people in but i don't trust any party in our government to handle it competently.

My logic was that it would be less harmful to the country to let less people in than letting a lot of people in without an actually good system in place of vetting and integrating them. Kind of a ""lesser of two evils"" situation.

Back then i was actually pretty content with the state of the country other than that. I don't think i would've voted for them again even if this didn't happen, because i have shifted focus to stuff like housing prices and the economy over the refugee thing.

I do not think there is a ethnic replacement going on.  
I do not think a Muslim born in the EU is an immigrant.  
Although, I think being a Muslim should not give you privilege of being free from being criticized because of their religion. Religion is not ethnicity.  
Muslims should bring their religion into the 21st century and stop being a problem for everybody.  
They should grow up, ditch medieval things like religious laws, [bags for women](https://youtu.be/zLC8ipOjrMc), [being ultra offended when someone tells something about their religion](https://youtu.be/5TvsaOC3v38), start having doubts about their religion, embrace the western values, embrace the enlightenment, embrace the modernity, westernize  and change the culture of problems and terrorism their religion breeds.   
Muslims should understand why they are not liked, internalize it and change the way they behave.   
Not everything is because of external factors. Sometimes it is you.  
Nobody owns them anything.  
Nobody owns them living according to the habits they bring.   
Nobody owns them not shaking women's hand and so on.  
They are not better than anyone else.  
Muslim countries are not part of the EU, there are no reciprocal agreements with them like there are withing EU. An atheist is not allowed to enter Mecca.  
And they should be criticized because they are part of the society, they also  create it that is why the requirements of the society should also apply to them.  
There should be no situation when Muslim men are allowed to beat Muslim women because it is a different culture. That is insane. No, they are a part of the same enlightened, western culture and the police should come and arrest a Muslim men beating his wife just like it would in any other situation.  
And bags for women should be banned because brainwashing women into wearing bags is not accepted in the western culture where equality of the sexes and a fight against patriarchy is important.

However it's true that if someone needs tax cuts to afford 4+ children, then those people probably won't have that many resources that are strongly needed in today's world if you want your child to have good living prospects.

Housing costs keep getting higher and higher, it's getting more and more difficult for young people to afford to buy their own flats/houses and you can see it already in many European countries that those young people whose parents can't give/lend them enough money for the deposit on a mortgage, end up being priced out of the real estate market, especially in the bigger cities, and end up stuck in rented apartments that keeps swallowing a big share of their salary, again leaving them with little possibility to save up money.

Hence have as many kids as you want, but maybe also think twice what you can provide them or not.

552,"&gt; Negative Interest Rates are a thing now!

Okay? So? Negative interest rates aren't an inherently bad thing. The interest rates are this low because loans are so easy to get. Loans are easy to get because the European Central Bank is keeping them low. Cheap loans stimulate economies and give way to new business, high interest rates don't. In fact encouraging wealthy people to keep hundreds of thousands in the bank rather than go out and spend it is actually a negative. You could maybe say that people who don't have enough money to invest yet have enough to be saving up are affected by this. But getting a 0.5% interest rate as opposed to a 4% interest rate a couple of years ago isn't going to make much of a difference when you only have a few thousand Euros in the bank anyhow.

&gt;Inflation is near 0%? Tell that to someone that saw house prices and rents more than double in the last 5 years!

That is because inflation and the housing market are two separate entities that don't move at a 1:1 ratio. You could argue that house prices doubling is a good thing for home owners. 

That being said I do agree with you that housing/rent prices are out of control right now. But you're putting the blame at the wrong address. The EU has no way of regulating housing in any one city in Europe. That is solely within the control of individual countries and their municipalities. You're seeing the problem and you're acknowledging it, which is great. But for whatever reason you've decided to pin _all_ problems in Europe on the EU and I'd encourage you to look closer into if this is entirely fair on a case by case basis.

&gt;the-brain-drain-in-europe

As I brought up in my previous comment it's not inherently bad that people are moving around. Yes short term it might have effects, but a Romanian dentist who already has his clinic set up and is established within a community isn't suddenly going to sell everything and move to Germany. Most people moving are already unemployed as their country has too few opportunities for them. Brain Drain can also be a positive for countries, as with less competition those that _do_ decide to stay tend to fare far better, something which again is amplified by the EU giving sizeable subsidies to startups and giving them the infrastructure to ship across Europe once established.

&gt;The EU is rife with tax evasion!

I agree and this is a serious problem. I'm Dutch myself and quite frankly ashamed that our government keeps being involved in all these scandals. But again, the tax evasion is facilitated by national governments not the EU themselves. It would be great if the EU stepped up and did something about this, but doing so would require them to have _more_ power. Something you are actively arguing against right now. Again, you're seeing the problem but pointing the finger at the wrong person.

&gt;people that are working for the EU Institutions don't pay the same tax rates as the people of the country where they live in

Which makes sense. Because the EU can't pay two people working in the same position vastly different amounts. Yet the reality is every country has different taxation rates. So if they were to pay everyone the same they'd still effectively have a discrepancy in pay as someone being paid 50K a year and taxed 20% effectively earns less than someone being paid 50K a year and taxed 30%. 

I feel you're really missing an easy point you could be making instead though. Namely that some of the highest tier EU officials are quite frankly overpaid by all metrics. More so there is almost no oversight over what they claim are expenses. 

No offence, but this doesn't help your credibility much. Because there _is_ a very real problem in the way some EU officials are paid. An undeniable problem that is inexcusable. And when the subject comes up and you're able to score a point that you can't possibly miss.... you miss it. Instead bringing up a quirk in taxation, that's simply a logical and unavoidable consequence of having to pay people the same amounts when you employ them across different taxation systems.

&gt;Yeah, there's 0 reports of rich nations importing people from other countries to counter their own dwindling populations because their people cannot afford to reproduce due to unsustainable costs of living

Again, do you not understand how silly this sounds? These people aren't forcibly relocated to work in German supermarkets. People chose to move to these countries themselves because they believe they can build a better life there. If the EU facilitates people building a better life for themselves _and_ helping alleviate a problem in the country they move to that seems like a win-win. Now you could bring up the fact that these lives aren't guaranteed to be better than the ones they are leaving behind. But that's the risk they voluntarily take when they move. One one drunk Polish man laying on a park bench doesn't really proof anything. Especially since if he really did like it more in Poland he could simply make his way back.

“As Birmingham was the center of industry and population in Alabama, in 1963 civil rights leaders chose to mount a campaign there for desegregation. Schools, restaurants and department stores were segregated; no African Americans were hired to work in the stores where they shopped or in the city government supported in part by their taxes. There were no African-American members of the police force. Despite segregation, African Americans had been advancing economically. But from 1947 to 1965, Birmingham suffered ""about 50 racially motivated bomb attacks.""[55] Independent groups affiliated with the KKK bombed transitional residential neighborhoods to discourage blacks' moving into them; in 19 cases, they bombed black churches with congregations active in civil rights, and the homes of their ministers.[55])”",,/r/europe/comments/bpopu6/what_actually_happens_when_a_country_bans/eo1l8dy/,senorjorel12,1558201509

You actually think the Hitlerjugend was a communist project?

And as for economics? The Nazis had very little of an economic policy in the first part, besides ""cleansing"" it from jewish interference. After doing so, Hitler had no problem working with those.

&gt;Fascists care for but one thing: power. All words are meaningless statements to win votes. Hence why they are called populists.

Just... no. Facist can be populists, but they are not the same. How the fuck do you actually bring yourself to the point where you think Facist aren't nationalist, but really just populists? You think fucking Hitler would've gone communist if that brought him close to power?

The short answer is yes - people have the right to self determination *if achieved through peaceful democratic means*. I don't and will never support an armed struggle for independence.

I'm not familiar with the movement's in any of those countries though, only Catalonia and Corsica so I can't comment on the 'motiviation' for them to break away.

You mention that you abhor breaking up of regional powers, I'd like to point out that if Scotland was to vote to leave the UK, with no intention of joining the larger EU, then I would not vote for independence. The UK is isolating itself from our closest allies and I strongly dislike that. There is no such thing as 100% sovereignty, it's always shared, something that the UK seems to struggle to comprehend.

The EU to me is a much larger internationalist movement, and I want Scotland to be part of that. Being in the EU and not the UK also gives Scotland control over things like the economy, foreign policy etc. 

I disagree that the UK will want to stay orientated to the EU, that's why many want to leave as they see things like workers rights, freedom of movement, and environmental legislation from the EU as interference. I think the UK will align much more with the US and we'll see the dismantling of our health service in favour of a US-style insurance system, food and agriculture rules will be loosened, and environmental protections will be removed.",Scotland,/r/europe/comments/bq1uyn/if_you_are_an_eu_national_go_vote_in_the_eu/eo19k48/,Caledonia91,1558194548

681,"&gt; As far as I'm aware Spain acknowledges the existence of the Catalonian government [...]

Nope, more on the opposite.

Catalonian government isn't any different than Murcia's or Extremadura's within Spain. We're just another autonomous community, and if the government happens to be independentist, well, that's that and nothing else.

To Spain this means nothing, only that we're, to quote PSOE's foreign 
minister wording, ""to be disinfected"".

&gt;[...] they just don't think you're going to be independent

Well, they're our owners, demographically speaking.

We don't have much of a choice here, our fate is very much tied to what the Spaniards decides for us.

Yeah sure, because we're a national minority we're stupid right? Quite xenophobic.

The examples were just to portray who's got the power here, which is Spain, and how they're abusive about it.

Well, having to agree to a 55% part in a referendum is essentially unfair, wouldn't you say?

As of now, the main power of decision making doesn't rest in the hands of the comission nor in parliament but in the Council of Europe where every member state has the same voice. Nothing can be passed without the consent of the Council of Europe. However all member states have to agree for any serious legislation to be passed.

The parliament could _not_ have removed the parts they disagreed with. They tried to, in August. The member stages disagreed, they negotiated for half a year, and in the end the member states added them back, albeit with added protections.

Furthermore, your premise is false. The law doesn't require upload filters in the way you say it does. It requires a certain type of website to make a best effort towards taking offline copies of previously reported specific works. They cannot be forced to monitor all uploads on the basis of this directive (although the member states insisted on allowing them to add such a requirement themselves in individual member states), not can it force websites to use a tool that is not accessible to them including due to its cost, and it does allow a website to take or a member state to require any measures that could result in the removal of legitimate works.

This is why the technical experts don't make sense. ""You can't remove all infringing content without false positives."" This statement is correct, but it has nothing to do with the law.

869,"&gt;This isn't surprising because Germany benefits from the EU the most and it has the most influence and power within the EU, meaning giving more power to EU institutions is in accord with the national interest of Germany.

This is actually a logical contradiction. Germany has in fact been against giving more power to EU institutions,  Schäuble even threatening the Commission with breaking up if it went more political, exactly because it is the most influential member in the union and doesn't want more competition from a central institutions. This is the same reason why they've been critical of Draghi and his policies.

And this is why for the past 10 years, despite the rethoric, Germany has stood against stronger European solutions prefering intergovernmental meetings where they can push their weight, and why they currently and in constant disagreement with Macron who actually does want central institutions that would even the decision weight in favour of France and the rest.",,/r/europe/comments/bpxpuh/german_poll_on_future_development_of_the_eu_i/eo0ou0b/,InitialEstablishment,1558180004

902,"&gt;What problem? I've never said that the UK should be part of the EU or any other union. They can be hermetically isolated from the international community if that's their choice, for all I care. I want my country to be part of the EU,that's all and I'm not seeing why the UK's ""solved"" problem should be of any relevance to it.

The initial point was that countries thriving outside of political unions was akin to winning the lottery, I pointed out that most countries were not part of political unions (or rather, political unions worth of the name) and that is accurate unless you expand 'political union' to include essentially any intergovernmental grouping that discusses politics.

I picked on the UK as it is leaving the EU, and because you included the commonwealth as political union, apparently similar enough to the EU to be something a country could be part of that made it not stand alone.

Obviously if you want your country to be part of the EU that's great, that suggests the EU is working for you. But the OP's claim was that countries have difficulty surviving outside such a union. And again, that's absurd as most countries are not part of a union that comes close to what the EU is.

And the UK is clearly not isolating itself from the international community, it is removing itself from arguably the deepest and broadest non-national political union on the planet, because there isn't support for membership. That seems entirely reasonable and quite a long way (given the UK's participation in any number of other organisations and its very effective international outlook..) from anything akin to isolation.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/bpvbey/majority_of_europeans_think_the_eu_will_fall/eo0hfht/,-ah,1558172081

if i was bigoted towards Hungarians i would double down on my comments, but i dont, honestly.

thats my opinion, you dont have to like it, but thats how i feel.

Hungarian culture is alien to me, too conservative, and imho, i find it backwards.

the Hungarian zeitgeist is more similar to the Turks than you would admit, closer to the Russians even.

as is evident by the election of Orban, and Fidesz ruling the country.

Hungary is governed by a proto fascist my guy, you dont get to lecture me.

my main issue is with the gov, not the people perse, only to a certain degree do i have an issue with them because they elected Fidesz.

1038,"It's never been that simple. Since Maastricht when the EU was formed from a humble trading bloc, the Conservative party has been at war with itself. Basically a referendum should have been held but it wasn't because it would have been lost. The UK government muscled it through and the anti-Maastricht faction has simmered ever since.

If all the anti-EU/anti-Maastricht Tories went away then the Conservatives could never govern. After Lisbon (no referendum again) UKIP started really bleeding those anti-EU Tories away, MPs and voters. As UKIP grew, the Tories got weaker. To fix this civil war in the party, David Cameron called the Brexit referendum hoping to address the lack of democracy/ settle the matter/ kill off UKIP.

So just by bleeding away a minority of Tories, UKIP was threatening the Conservatives ability to get a majority and govern. And so even though it had hardly any MPs in parliament, UKIP had huge political power - enough to force the referendum clearly.

But the referendum did not heal the Tory rift, it made things much worse. And for the Conservative party it's worse than ever, if even say 20% of Tory voters stop voting for them then they will never govern again.

Theresa May thinks that if she passes her Brexit deal then the Brexiters will be happy and the war will be over, likewise if she does not pass it then the Conservative party is finished. That's why she has been willing to do absolutely anything and endure any humiliation to get it through.

However it is not true. Many/most Brexiters consider this to be another Maastricht/Lisbon stitch up. ie not really leaving the EU. So passing this Brexit deal is not going to save them, because Farage is coming to eat their lunch at the next general election. The Tory MPs are just now starting to realise how fucked they are and the EU elections are going to crystallize this.

Nobody gives a shit about the European elections but if it highlights that the Brexit party is getting huge support then it show the Tories cannot win the next UK general election. The only chance they have now is to deliver a full hard Brexit (giving the BP no reason to exist) and thus winning back those BP voters.

The Tories are about to select a new leader. If they don't pick a brexiteer then they are finished. The MPs whittle down the choice of new leader to 2 then the party membership vote between them. At least 75% of the Tory membership want a hard brexit. There are some efforts by MPs to rig this by selecting 2 Remainer leaders to let the membership choose from. But the membership are so mad I do not think this will help anything, the Brexit party will just get bigger.

tldr; The only way the Tories can survive is to win back the Brexit Party voters, but some Tories have not realised this yet. The European elections is going to highlight quite how much support the Brexit Party has and thus what a danger they are.",,/r/europe/comments/bpwisu/is_this_the_unholy_trinity_of_eu_elections/eo0e7i0/,massive_shit_fucker,1558165693

&gt;Neither Jewish ethics nor Jewish tradition can disqualify terrorism as a means of combat. We are very far from having any moral qualms as far as our national war goes. We have before us the command of the Torah, whose morality surpasses that of any other body of laws in the world: ""Ye shall blot them out to the last man.""
&gt;
&gt;But first and foremost, terrorism is for us a part of the political battle being conducted under the present circumstances, and it has a great part to play: speaking in a clear voice to the whole world, as well as to our wretched brethren outside this land, it proclaims our war against the occupier.
&gt;
&gt;We are particularly far from this sort of hesitation in regard to an enemy whose moral perversion is admitted by all.

That's not valid at all.  It's akin to saying the scrutiny Iran recieves is due to racism. It may be a factor, but to claim it categorical is, is wrong.   That discrepancy in itself could be more evidence of an anti Iranian double standard.




In effect what your position does is punish Palestinian activisim by casting them as racist, for being successful.

Surely some are, having migrated from Europe.

That's not unique to islam. Do I have to point to Christian fundamentalism to show you some of the atrocities caused in the name of the faith? How about the atrocities of the Buddhist majority in burma *against* the Muslim minorities in north Rakhine? 

&gt; Flags to destroy the west, and particularly Israel and the USA are flown around constantly. 

I mean, would you be surprised? The Iranian revolution didn't occur because life was nice under the Shah. it's because the popularly elected prime minister was overthrown by an Anglo-American Coup and their nascent democracy was replaced by an authoritarian monarch who ruled the country through the secret police. 

&gt; You are naive if you think the caliphate is over.

Sigh, when you don't know what the word caliphate is. 

&gt; As soon as Islam had a majority in Lebanon, we saw Christian persecution and massacres once more.

The history of Islam and Christianity in lebanon is incredibly complicated and you're ignoring all the nuance of it. I'm not surprised, but disappointed. You also realise that Lebanon has gone from being a quarter Christian back to 40% Christian today right? The Christian population in Lebanon is recovering. The entire context of what happened in Lebanon was because despite a large Arab population, Lebanese Christians controlled the country and were supported by the French government (which set up the colonial state.) The issue was fought on all fronts, not just religious. It was just as geopolitical as it was religious. It also wasn't a simple Christians vs. Muslims conflict as you seem to want to portray it as. And it wasn't as if Christians were all innocent in the conflict. There was plenty of blood on all sides. Karantina massacre just got magically erased from your mind????? 

Also, I love how you're ignoring that Greece was under an Islamic government for literally hundreds of years (as was the rest of the Balkans) and most Balkan countries are still christian majorities. This isn't something intrinsic to Islam. 

&gt; The Islamic party in belgium is talking about a 2030 systematic takeover. and sharia law.

1358,"&gt; You wouldn’t care so much about this terrible crime if “insert ethnic/racial group” weren’t doing it is a weak defense, one that doesn’t even deny the crime.


&gt; Israel gets attention for the same reason that South Africa got attention; it’s a foreigner beating up on people who look like the rest of the region.

Lots to unpack here.

1) It is absolutely valid to point out that the level of scrutiny Israel receives is anti-Semitism.


African Americans in the US smoke marijuana at the same rate as white Americans yet are incarcerated at rates multiple times higher. Why? Discriminatory practices that focus on one group for a.similar behavior

No one is 'denying the crime' - Israel has a human rights problem but so do other countries yet Israel is targeted in the international sphere multiple times more often, including with elimination rhetoric that you almost never see elsewhere

2) As others have pointed out, Jewish people are not foreigners - they are a *diverse* category of people who have been living in the Levant (and Mediterranean and MENA) region since the beginning and have the language, culture archaeological evidence which support their peoplehood and home in the Levant


3) The 'well just look at them! Their foreigners!' is beyond disgusting and uses a cherry picked set of facts and circumstances to make the basically. *racial science* case (gross).

If you see a modern Israel you'd notice they very much are darker because of the of Arab/Mizrahi Jewish people. Not that Israelis being a certain tone should matter (there are extremely light skinned Lebanese, Palestinians, and Syrians and this whole line of reasoning is really quite sick)

4) The Arab expansion into the Levant from the Arabian peninsula is not commonly referenced but happened, after the Roman depopulation of the Israelites so claiming you know what an original Levantine should look like makes it sound like you have a time machine

5) The rest of the world.

China is literally importing tens of thousands of Han Chinese into the Uighur and other ethnic enclaves we today consider China and has very very little UN scrutiny. Myanmar is also doing a 'textbook ethnic cleansing' I believe is the phrase and yet you have other countries falling over each other for Belt and Road with condemnation on a scale literally microscopic compared to Israel.

**And Syria**

The minority Alawite hereditary kingdom which has literally murdered it's way to 'victory' - killing people on a scale multiple times that of the whole Israel Palestinian conflict and yet has how many boycott movents or UN  resolutions against it.

Syria has literally a country wide network of torture prisons and has pushed (with the help of Russia, Iran, and Hezbollah) the majority Sunni population into smaller enclaves 

___

I know the 'look around the world argument isn't popular' - within seconds of making my first post I was attack by another poster whose comment still stands - but the truth is that people try to justify a level of scrutiny on Israel that is truly the product of a hateful bias. 

If the law and rules are ever applied equally I will be happy for people to focus on Israel, whatever the level of attention since I'd know it's fair and commiserate with others - but no one can say that with a straight face, just try to justify with weak arguments, some of which are really hateful and ugly",Yup,/r/europe/comments/bpt1kg/germany_designates_bds_israel_boycott_movement_as/enzgtzx/,the_raucous_one,1558146695

1361,"To be fair, each of these nations individually is not ""the EU"". France certainly messed things up a bit (though I'm not sure what you are referring to with the UK and Italy?) by supporting a rogue element that now turned against the UN-backed government in Triplois, but this is a result of unilateral backdoor meddling.

I would not want *any* single EU Member State to go off and do things by itself, for precisely the reason that national interests might undermine the humanitarian aspect of the mission. I am under the impression that the EU *as a whole* should, or so I hope, be able to come up with a more farsighted plan, with better transparency and within the scope of the EU's Common Security and Defense Policy in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter.

I think you have a point when it comes to expenditure, however; it would be unrealistic to assume the EU can just project its reach across the globe. Perhaps ""regional police"" would be a better choice of words, although reach can still be expanded indirectly by simply contributing to United Nations peacekeeping missions.

The Chinese are currently talking about the world having a ""multipolar"" future, and I could see the US, the EU and the PRC each having their own sphere of influence (North- and South America, Europe and Africa, and Asia, respectively) where these blocs attempt to exert some level of influence in their own way and in accordance with their ideology. There will of course be some overlap, as both the EU and the US have ties to Japan, which may see itself threatened by future China, so we'll just have to see how exactly things will be moving forward.

To answer your question more directly, I don't think we have to reach the same level of the USN; that'd be overkill for what we should try to achieve. The core of a a hypothetical permanent EUNAVFOR would likely be built primarily around French and Italian naval assets (perhaps the UK as well *if* they opt to stay after all or at some point rejoin the bloc).",Europe,/r/europe/comments/bpoumk/germany_informs_nato_of_huge_defense_budget/enzh356/,akashisenpai,1558146805

You are naive if you think the caliphate is over. Isis Hamas Al queda and all these factions, are impatient and constantly create violence.

1431,"&gt; Too bad you haven't found time to bring a valid argument to counter my points.

Nor did you. Generalizing 10 countries based on 3 would still be abysmally pathetic and (I hope) you know it - but it's also incorrect since Romania was not part of the 2004 enlargement of the EU.

If you try to ""educate"" us yet you fail both on factual grounds (one should expect that the person arguing against the 2004 enlargement would actually know which countries were part of it) and on moral grounds (having a problem with some governments not upholding EU values while you're pretty much generalizing tens of millions of people), well, you cannot seriously expect us to think that we should have a discussion with you.

And that's just the very tip of the iceberg. If you actually had a clue what you were talking about you'd also know that Fidesz pretty much adopted all the achievable far-right policies of Jobbik, and the actual far-right core of Jobbik left the party and founded the Mi Hazánk Mozgalom; and thus Jobbik has positioned itself at the centre-right with nationalistic rhetoric but actually centre-left social policies.

1485,"&gt; - Neoclassical and keynesian economics are not political ideologies like marxism. 

Oh, they absolutely are. Their theories directly produce and influence political and philosophical views; arguably these economic theories have had vastly more effect on politics than philosophy has in the last 300 years. Again i suggest the book by Wolff.

&gt;- LOL Those are not modern classes ahahahahah besides Marx said those classes were disappearing but that didn't happen, so classes were very relevant ahahahahah

Thats literally not at all what he said. Slaves and Petit-Bourgeoisie/Lumpen Proleteriat definately exist today too, the latter two especially (Petit-Bourgeoisie is mostly managers and small business owners, Lumpen Proleteriat is mostly unemployed, refugees, career criminals, ect). The Free The Slaves organisation estimates there is somewhere between 20 and 50 million contemporary slaves around the world today. Many countries still have kings and an effective aristocracy.

Marx's definitions of class were defined such that he could easily describe economic and productive relations; hence why such vague terms as ""middle"", ""lower"" and ""upper"" class are disregarded in marxian theories, as proleterians and bourgeoisie could each effectively be any one of those.

&gt;- Communists advocated for a different regime without any oppositions, like fascism. 

Some communists.

&gt; They used violence, like fascism. 

Like all revolutionaries, or have you forgotten the American and French revolutions you mentioned in your prior comment?

&gt;They persecuted people with different ideas, like fascism. 

Most regimes have done so. The US literally murdered or assassinated hundreds of its own citizens of their political views in the cold war, and arrested thousands more. Not on the scale of the US but they do do it. China today, being extremely capitalist, literally has ""gulags"". Fuck, Germany probably would have turned socialist (ran by people who were anti-leninists mind you!) in the 1919 revolution had the liberal Social Democrat party not LITERALLY PARTNERED WITH FASCIST PARAMILITARIES to EXTRAJUDICIALLY MURDER their opposition (Rosa Luxemburg and the rest of the Sparticist leadership). Liberals like to pretend this was for ""self defense"" or ""anti-terrorism"", ignoring the fact that the freikcorps had already murdered half a dozen peaceful communist strikers before the Sparticist had even decided to take up arms, which was literally the morning of the day they were murdered.


&gt;I noticed you skipped the part that linked capitalism and developed democratic countries ahahhahahahaha

China's economic success in the last 30 years has been the greatest

1555,"Right. The ONLY reason Brexit didn't go through was Northern Ireland's ""hard border problem"".

Because of the Good Friday Agreement that ended (we hope!) terrorism in Northern Ireland, the hard border can't be with the Republic of Ireland. It seems like David Cameron didn't even think about the UK's land border with the EU and imagined our only border was the sea one (English Channel / North Sea).

The only other place to put the hard border is between Northern Ireland and the British mainland, which would compromise the territorial integrity of the UK. The only way that doesn't happen is if Scotland (which voted to remain, along with Northern Ireland) votes for independence in ""IndyRef 2.0"" and takes Northern Ireland with it.

The ultimate end game of Brexit years down the line would be the United Kingdom of Scotland and Northern Ireland within the EU and the United Kingdom of England and Wales outside the EU. That would satisfy the 2016 result, with the Remain nations in the EU and the Brexit nations outside the EU. (The UK is currently 4 nations and the union is very weak in the current situation. England's strong Brexit stance outside of London is the main stress on the union. Wales is a Brexit nation too but their political influence isn't strong.)

The oddest thing I find about the Brexit camp is the idea that the UK is going to be independent outside of the EU. I don't believe the UK will survive Brexit. Scotland is agitating hard to leave the UK and rejoin the EU if Brexit goes through, and if Scotland leaves, it will be highly convenient for Scotland to leave with Northern Ireland so that Northern Ireland doesn't have a border with the Republic of Ireland but without Irish reunion. Northern Ireland is also a Remain nation so that would fit with their vote. And of course there are some ethnic ties.

The next issue I have with Brexit from a nationalist perspective (I consider myself I nationalist), is that the rump kingdom would be wedged between the USA and the EU, 2 behemoth economic blocs that we would have NO real influence over. Being inside the EU is a huge boon because it means inside influence. SOME influence is better than NO influence. The Chinese view of ""the UK outside of the EU"" is that the UK would be nobody. The only country China cares about is Germany, and Germany would have even more influence within the EU than ever without the UK being there.

The main EU powers are Germany, France and the UK. The UK giving up such an amazing slot within the EU makes no sense from a purely selfish UK perspective. I know the Brexit camp want to turn the clock back to 1800, but there are powers in the world today that did not exist at their current power level in 1800. I mean the USA is on the way down but they are still a behemoth and China was nobody but they are the new behemoth.

The EU is also a behemoth as long as we can keep it together and that would be a really good idea for our collective sovereignty.",The Netherlands,/r/europe/comments/bpq9e4/no_thank_you/enyhns0/,Niravel,1558129669

Albanians were one of the last people in the Balkans to fall to the Ottoman Empire and were one of the best mercenaries in Europe and were so effective that it managed to convince the European powers to remodel their heavy cavalry after the Albanian Stratioti of the Venetian army in the 16th century.

 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratioti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratioti) 

Albanians managed to preserve a language that was the only language banned in the Empire and prone to extinction while they were living facing constant persecution, but of course this doesn't fit the typical ""Turko-Albanian"" mentality you guys love.

&gt; What victory do you have? Turks and you on all Balkan people? Italy and you on all neighbour, now it's USA and you. But you know how this story will eventually end.

1736,"&gt;If people move into an area and are able to convince 90% of the people to do things differently, they might have a good point. In any case, there’s no right or wrong. If 90% of the people want to livesome way or the other, let them be.

Who said anything about convincing anyone? We're talking about one group settling heavily in one area where they became a wast majority and demanding independence. The Albanians didn't convince any Serbs in Kosovo that independence is the way to go, they just vastly outnumbered them.

And fulfilling every separatist demand regardless of international law and history is a very dangerous road to go down. It essentially justifies not just stuff like Kosovo but outright annexations like Crimea.

&gt;Honestly.,, why do you even f*ing care it does not impact your life in any way... why do want to impose yourself on some region and people that has nothing to do with you? Why don’t you let them be...

Because Kosovo means a lot us Serbs. It's at the core of our national identity. And because I still have a sense of national pride, something that seems lost on plenty of you westerners. So yes, it something to do with me, it's a part of my country, my nation, being stolen from us. It impacts every Serb out there. And because I can't stand hypocrisy. So Croatia and Bosnia can secede from Yugoslavia yet we Serbs can't secede from them? The bullshit excuse was that secession will only be allowed in republic borders. Fine so be it, but then they support Kosovo's independence despite it never being a republic. Them being the West (the US, EU, NATO...). Blatant double standards.

1882,"&gt; Well, if we want to get into the legalese, one could argue that this definition is not restricted to the defence of German citizens alone, 

It only includes other citizens in so far as it occurs within a proper, reciprocal alliance structure like NATO which also assures German citizens' safety.

&gt;Peacekeeping also means defending someone, after all.

No, not for our constitution. Case in point: Art. 115a: *""[...] the federal territory is under attack by armed force or imminently threatened with such an attack (state of defence) [...]""*. Peacekeeping has nothing to do with the basic constitutional raison d'être of our armed forces.

The only avenue through which peacekeeping efforts are legal is not through Art. 87a but Art. 24 II: *""With a view to maintaining peace, the Federation may enter into a system of mutual collective security; in doing so it shall consent to such limitations upon its sovereign powers as will bring about and secure a lasting peace in Europe and among the nations of the world.""*

This is the constitutional (and with accompanying legislation, the legal) basis for German *out of area* deployments. It's clearly not related to the basic task of the armed forces, and as a matter of fact, foreign deployments were widely regarded as illegal until the Federal Constitutional Court ruled it legal (some might say invented the legal justification) in the 1990s.

The broader point I'm making here is that neither peacekeeping nor resource exploitation are constitutionally part of our national defence and thus the Bundeswehrs core task.",,/r/europe/comments/bpoumk/germany_informs_nato_of_huge_defense_budget/enx1qd9/,Bojarow,1558108155

I'm not implying that their concerns are unsubstantiated - because this isn't just about what people perceive. This is about what people do with it. This is the context of the comment you replied.

&gt; **OUR PEOPLE FIRST**

&gt; VLAAMS BELANG

--------
&gt; Dear young voter,
&gt;
&gt;A lot of young people are **fed up with 'politics'** and I can't blame them. After all, most politicians change their opinions like you and I change socks. Their **expensive promises** often turn out to be **cheap lies** again and again.

-----
&gt; **OUR YOUTH FIRST**

&gt; The **'multicultural dream'** has turned out to be a **nightmare**. Vlaams Belang is the only party that promises you to stand up for the young people who are **beaten up at the bus stop** - or the girl that gets **assaulted** by so called 'youth gangs'.

&gt; We're sticking up for our youth, for you, so that we can **feel at home again** in our own country. The Vlaams Belang stands for a **resilient Flemish youth**. The Vlaams Belang will make Flanders **great, beautiful, prosperous and safe** again.

&gt; MAKE FLANDERS GREAT AGAIN

---------
&gt; **PROTECT OUR IDENTITY**

&gt; Our traditions are under fire. Easter eggs are turned into **hiding eggs**, Christmas markets into **winter parties** en even **Zwarte Piet**(you'll have to google this one yourself I'm afraid) has to suffer.

&gt; Enough is enough for the Vlaams Belang. Done with the touchy multiculturalism and done with jettisoning our own individuality. Every nation has a **right to individuality**.

1938,"&gt;You can be sure that it would be much less likely to happen again. 

How? The punishment still doesn't impact whoever makes the decision. What's stopping them from doing it all over again?

&gt; Add on to that keeping the decision makers criminally responsible and you're all set.

The problem with that is criminal responsibility has to be **proven** in court. It's very easy to obfuscate exactly who consciously broke the law in any large organization, which is why it's a lot easier to punish the corporation as a whole instead of individual employees/managers.

You can bet your ass that the big CEO with the expensive lawyers will make very sure that it's some random underling who will get stuck with all the blame.

&gt; Thieves aren't set free because their families would collapse otherwise, why should shareholders be better off than the family?

Actually in many judicial systems familial situation is most definitely taken into account when deciding the punishment for certain crimes. And the problem with going after the shareholders is again a matter of proving who did what wrong and who benefited in what amount from the criminal actions.

1982,"&gt;*You are stating the principles of what I said in your first paragraph and then you contradict yourself in the seconds.* Yes, the stones, the timber and the bricks do carry the heritage, for it is their wear and tear, holes of bullets, possible damage that is the one that marks how time passes. And this is why a reconstruction will always be a fake, because it is erasing that value.

I am not. Have you even read what I've written?

&gt;The design, in this case, is not as relevant, being born out of a Neogothical fanaticism that seeked to ""medievalise"" Notre Dame with an idealised spire, unlike the one the Church previously had, which instead was born of the ideas that are actually based in Gothic architecture (that is, eerie weightlessness, verticality, etc; ideas present in Viollet-le-Duc's design only as an imitation of the old design and not as the main objective).

&gt;*eerie weightlessness, verticality, etc;* are but some principles of Gothic aesthetic. V-l-D's solution achieved exactly that, unlike some cuboid boxes that you think would *""symbolize""* it instead.

&gt;And nobody is being constricted by the 100 year old modernist movement, at least not in Barcelona, where we've actually got a pretty high density of architects specialised in contemporary designed restoration projects, such as Carles Enrich's (former professor of mine) contextualism, 2, 3, Enric Miralles's genious (best architect in Europe in the latest 40 years), NUA Architects contemporanism (talked with these guys), 1, 2, Pericio i Clotet expertise, 1 or H Arquitectes talent, 1, 2.

I do implore the reader to take a look on the said examples. Do you not see that the king is naked? Neither of these designs is a restoration, it is precisely a modernist addition (clean unadorned surface, with wild geometric shapes that only barely resemble the outline of the older building).

1989,"&gt; So we then just allow banks to commit fraud and make easy money while everyone else labours from day to day?

In real life you take what you can get. A sure-thing no-consequence 200 million fine is a lot better than gambling on getting a 20 billion fine, where you might end up with nothing at all if you can't prove sufficient personal culpability and where your economy might suffer for more than 20 billion even if you do win. It's not perfect, but real life rarely is.

&gt; Your point is sort of correct, but then you could reason that after a few banks go bankrupt, the banks start taking into account the immense cost of fraud and stop committing fraud because it is too costly.

So how many innocent people need to suffer just to teach these banks a lesson? Especially because there are still zero personal consequences for the people leading those banks and making those decisions.

&gt; As someone said, presently, you commit fraud and get fined less than the profit you make from the fraud. At that point that just becomes good business sense.

I'm not disagreeing with you. I'm merely saying that levying big fines is not a solution to this problem.

&gt; Another option would be to put people who commit fraud in prison, it is difficult to prove culpability, but make very lax laws so that everyone goes to prison, not very fair, but in the long run it's better, as it would serve as deterrent and for society at large the outcome would be more favourable.

It is better for 10 criminals to walk free than for one single innocent person to be imprisoned. This is the basis of any modern legal system. What will happen if you hold employees and managers personally responsible is that the big-shot CEO with the expensive lawyers will attempt to make sure the criminal culpability always lies with some random underling. It most definitely will not be better either in the short or in the long run.

 If this problem had such easy solutions as all the populist nonsense being thrown around in this thread, it would have been solved long ago.",Flanders,/r/europe/comments/bpnq53/the_eus_powerful_competition_authority_has_fined/enwp6h8/,Nemo84,1558101038
1990,"The Christian ‘revolution’ speaking as an athiest.. was predominantly spread by Constantine the great, to unite and re-establish a collapsing Roman Empire.

Constantine the great was the first to put cross to shield, and defend european culture.

A meme, is for example and evolutionary trait like beavers that build dams.. or bees who have a hive. A bird that naturally creates a nest.

Humanity developed on stories.. before we even had language. This is our evolutionary competitive advantage over apes. We had no internet.

So what can replace our values and stories? Well the answer is AI algorthyms. But this is dangerous. Where we create a ‘new mandated’ story.

2024,"Basically what everyone who has no understanding of aerial vehicle says. Literally the same sentiment that was felt a hundred years ago. 

Drones have redundancies and a high level of automation, like obstacle avoidance, stereo computer vision, visual position tracking and similar. Delivery drones use private company APIs to check their precise to the second flight plans against air traffic and airspace restrictions. In many countries, it is illegal to fly above crowds, and drones have civil insurance like any vehicle to cover any damage done to a third party of things go wrong. Not that they do with fixed wing or 5 rotor UAVs. First can glide autonomously, second only require 4 rotors to land. Oh, and in an emergency, even cheap drones can RTH or return to home and land. Even consumer drones have visual landing capabilities to ensure they land precisely on a takeoff spot.

Militaries have means to take over most consumer drones and land them. They have means to jam their signal or blast them out of the sky if they are autonomous. These things are in use in Central Europe in some protected airspaces right now.

Drones and planes don't fall out of the sky, much less on people, where they aren't supposed to be, and we already have means to hard deny their presence in areas we don't want them in.

2046,"I think you're going too far by dismissing the Bundeswehr out of hand. It's bad but not that bad.

&gt; Not the US way in regime change every year or two but the French way

I don't see a real difference between France and the US, except in aggregate legality perhaps. In both cases the military is mostly built for cruising around in deserts and shooting up people the pinnacle of whose arms is represented by the odd RPG-7.

&gt;I would put my life in the hands of the French, British or even the Polish military every day before I would hope the Bundeswehr to save me.

That's where I'd like to address my initial point about you going too far in terms of dismissing the Bundeswehrs still existing capabilities. I would never trust Britain and France more than Germany in case of a Russian attack.

* In all likelihood, both have significant forces committed somewhere in Africa or the middle east and wouldn't arrive in time at all.

* Second, distance. Britain especially is disconnected from mainland Europe. France quite a bit further away.

* Third, as much as I like many French vehicle decisions, they don't have a way of giving their tanks reliable protected and mobile infantry support because their VBCI isn't tracked and only lightly armoured, whereas the German Puma/Marder can actually reliably drive around in off-road Eastern Europe.

* The French Artillery is unfortunately also mostly wheeled; and the British artillery is nigh-obsolete.

* Germany has considerably more modern tanks than either Britain and France; and yes, in case of war most of them would also work and be available. 

* The British tanks are also obsolete.

&gt;Germany might have great special forces but those wont win you an actual war, especially not if they are politically hamstrung, like most of the Bundeswehr is.

Poland has inherited a large vehicle fleet, they are modernising but not quite there yet. Still, because they built their army for defence in the East, they would probably be quite effective. I cannot say more.

The Bundeswehr is not politically harmstrung. It was for a time in Afghanistan perhaps, but that's been a decade now.

I completely agree that ""special forces"" are rather useless compared to their price tag.

&gt;For that spiking up the spending to 2% makes a lot of sense just to get everything back in working order, after that you can cruise on it a bit and slowly go back down to something more reasonable but for that there also needs to be political will and the Bundeswehr needs to gain a better reputation, not only externally and in politics but with the people. There needs to be a popular will backing an army or it's worth nothing.

I agree that even with the necessary culling of bureaucracy, we'd have to spend more for some years to undo the decades of mismanagement. 

I blame the army and the politicians for the lack of reputation. Have you noticed how they try to sell to the Germans that we need to spend more on the military? Basically they're saying we need to do it for our allies. Not once have I heard someone conclusively explain that it'd be good for ourselves.

2082,"&gt; This was the demographics of the balkans.Those lands were given after ww1 in order to punish bulgaria.Ethnic bulgarians were killed or expelled.People were happy for the opportunity of revenge.Is it bad?Yes.But the greeks did much worse than one village.

Well, yeah, why wouldn't Bulgaria be punished after very deliberately jumping in on the losing side of a world war? The peace has to mean something or else the aggressor will just do it again, by your own map Western Thrace looks mostly Greek anyway. If you jump into a war expecting to carve up other countries, don't be surprised if they do the same to you if you're not actually up to the task of winning.

The point I was driving at originally was that the conduct of Bulgaria in WWII was described as ""we were passive and were against the Holocaust,"" but that's only accurate as a relative statement compared to the likes of Nazi Germany, not in an absolute sense. You can spin whatever ""they started it!!"" justification for why it was actually OK for the Bulgarian administration to cause famines and deport people to Nazi camps, I'm content so long as we're admitting it happened.

&gt; Antisemitism in Bulgaria was unpopular because there was no time for it to emerge.Bulgaria was under ottoman rule so they couldn;t care less about jews.There was hate against turks and others but for jews it was unpopular but it happened.Now the jews in bulgaria had a bulgarian pasport.

I can read and appreciate that this is not as bad as Nazi Germany. However, that's a pretty low bar to congratulate oneself on. There was still the Law for Protection of the Nation that demanded for Jews to change their names, where they could live, confiscated their possessions (a fifth of their net worth!), excluded them from public service, kept them from marrying Bulgarians and limited the number in universities. Jews were forced to wear the Star of David, expelled from Sofia and had their property left behind confiscated. I can't look at this information and let talk about how Bulgaria was so truly great to Jews in WW2 go entirely unchallenged.

&gt; The newly given territories of bulgaria was not under direct bulgarian control but of a german one.The german said what to do and the bulgarian soldiers do it.The had no to say.

I really do doubt this, there's always a choice; heck, even native police in some directly German occupied countries refused to hand over Jews, and you're saying that this was impossible in land explicitly doled out to the Bulgarian administration? The entire point of the Germans handing it to Bulgaria was because they were more concerned with other pressing matters they wanted manpower on than to directly control what was going on in those lands. For example, the Italians did not put the Jews of the occupied section of Greece that Germany doled out to them into camps; this made the Nazis a bit upset, but the state of affairs only changed when Italy swapped sides in the war and Germany directly occupied it. (Though Italy did plenty of other heinous stuff in these times to more than make up for this particular case of a relative lack of evil.) I also really doubt this because orders for deportation were coming from way high on up in the Bulgarian government, repeatedly, and later attempts to deport were only frustrated by urging of key religious figures and mass protests about deporting Bulgarian's own citizens rather than foreigners. If it were just Germany's malign influence then what is the deal with these Ratnik guys sitting in the Prime Minister's office trying to cut deals with them?

&gt; You can look up many bulgarian jewish people on youtube who tell their stories one of them is Carl Djerassi(oral contraceptive pills,creator).

2100,"There's this hypothesis going around that women are only covering their hair because they're being forced to. That could be the case in some cases, and it isn't the case in others. Of the Muslim women that I know, most of them don't cover their hair, but some do. I've asked them questions about it (because I'm always interested in other people's religions) and all of the women I've talked to said that it's a personal choice, and then they cite a friend or relative that has chosen differently from them. Granted, the people I know are a biased sample, because they're people I've met at school or work and usually have university degrees and often have advanced degrees (which tends to not be the population that's oppressed, and in fact has an over-representation of feminists—for that reason, most of the women I'm friends with, Christian, Muslim, Jewish, Hindi, or atheist, whether they cover their hair or not, are educated and feminist, so the anecdotes I've heard definitely don't represent most people).

Now, suppose you do have a woman, let's call her Sarah, who works in a grocery store somewhere in Europe—London, Paris, Berlin, wherever. Sarah's father, or husband, or brother, or someone is forcing her to wear a hijab. She doesn't want to wear it for whatever reason… because maybe she doesn't want to be Muslim, or maybe she is a devout Muslim but in her interpretation of the Quran it's not necessary; she sees it as an outdated tradition. Each person is entitled to their own interpretation of their religion or lack thereof. So maybe Sarah works full-time at the supermarket, or maybe she works part-time there and spends the rest of her time as a student, or raising kids, or whatever. She's still going out living her life, earning money. She doesn't have the ideal amount of freedom, because no one should be forcing her to do anything she doesn't want to do, but this is Europe, so at least she can go around and do some things she wants to do.

Let's say there's a law passed banning hijabs anywhere in public, or maybe in workplaces (like the PQ wanted to do in Quebec), or on university campuses (like what was the law in Turkey from like 1924 until a few years ago). Whoever it is that's forcing her to wear it isn't just going to say, ""alright, you can go out with your head uncovered now."" They'll prevent her from going to work or uni or anywhere in public. The law that was supposedly supposed to help liberate women has just pushed them into a private space, out of view.

Now let's suppose there's another woman, let's call her Miriam, whose interpretation of the Quran is that being a modest woman means covering the head. Miriam wears a hijab by her own choice; her sister doesn't, and she's fine with that. This same hypothetical law gets passed. Maybe Miriam just goes on with her life with her hair uncovered and it doesn't really bother her. Or maybe it does bother her, but she complies with the law anyway, because it's the law. She wears hoodies and beanies for a while, but summer comes around and it gets hot and she looks strange and feels too hot anyway. So she goes around with her hair uncovered, but she feels a bit naked—sort of like how you might feel if a law was passed making it mandatory for women to show some cleavage. We've legislated away Miriam's personal choice, her agency.

Feminism definitely is about giving women the right to be topless wherever a man can, allowing women control over their bodies to decide whether or not to have an abortion, and not shaming women for having a sex drive, but it's also about allowing women to define their own modesty and being able to choose whether they wear short shorts or long skirts or cover their hair or shave one side their head.

I really think that as much as possible must be done to avoid forcing women to confirm to religious standards, but I think a big part of that is allowing women to fully choose for themselves.",Cambridge.

That's entirely the point. If I need to see it, it means it's a subjective thing. Now, I do see it, but the whole point is that there are indeed some who don't, and see something different instead: they see women not wearing an hajib as unjust, and people being forced to tollerate them as oppressed.  And, this is the key, there is no way to prove whether westerners or muslims are right. It doesn't even make sense to suggest that some are right and some are wrong.

&gt; Because then he didn’t go to the prison when PiS ruled? Hello, wake up, this is not how world work, he was in parliament with PiS because they didn’t send him to the prison and killed him after all.

What? First of all there is a difference between Parliament and Government - read about that.
Second, nobody has so far disclosed any evidence of Lepper being killed and Lepper having any evidence for anything. But since we’re speculating (I am, because you seem to be sure about everything without any evidence) - it os quite logical that Lepper had a lot of evidence on Pis wrongdoings from the time they were together in the Government in 2005-2007. So Lepper could have been killed on the orders of Kaczyński. Do you even understand the logic or you just act like you don’t understand?

PO corrupted? Like, everyone in PO except Tusk or what? Again, provide evidence. Sure there were couple of corrupt PO politicians. Tusk knew about corruption? Evidence?

Kaczyński not corrupt? Pis not corrupt? Read about SKOK affair, about Srebrna affair, Radom affair - just a couple of examples. Kaczyński didn’t know? Funny, he was directly involved in all of the Srebrna dealings - so saying he is not corrupt is being willfully ignorant.

He made the State buy the PKO SA bank and changed the Chairman of Board there and then made the bank lend money to whatever the Pis wanted. He planned to make this bank lend money for building of Srebrna but the recording by Burgfelner complicated his plans - this alone is the scandal much bigger than anything PO and Tusk have ever done.

But like I said there is more: SKOK, Radom, giveaways for Rydzyk, Pis politicians „working” in state owned companies with huge salaries... - the scale of Pis corruption is probably much bigger than any Government’s since 1990 - go ahead and act like Kaczyński is an innocent man...",,/r/europe/comments/bpcwr8/congress_no_us_military_base_for_poland_until_it/envymeu/,polishparish,1558086726

Trade was key to the city’s burgeoning fortunes, but Paris was gaining a reputation as a spiritual center as well. A saintly cult had been developing around its local martyr, St. Denis. According to tradition, Denis was beheaded on the hill of Montmartre (“martyrs’ mount”) in the mid- to late-third century A.D., after which he ran six or so miles while carrying his severed head. In a spot north of the city, alleged to be where he stopped running, a basilica was built in the 12th century to honor

One witness of the construction of the Basilica of Saint-Denis was the 12th-century Bishop of Paris, Maurice de Sully. He admired the work of the pioneering architects, who were building in the new Gothic style of soaring ceilings and abundant light.

2235,"If children realise they're trans before puberty, they can receive puberty blockers or start transitioning, saving thousands of euros pp on surgeries and psychiatric care. Right now awareness is so bad that a majority of trans people only find out after puberty has already left a permanent mark. Not realising you're lesbian or gay can also waste months or in some cases years on bad relationships.

Then there's children who are actively taught to be assholes by their parents, whose best chance at being a good person is through their experiences in public education. Orthodox Muslims and Christians, people with strong opinions on how society should be structured, etc.

As for lessons on racism, those are integrated into biology curriculums. Being sexually active in a healthy way is more complicated than not letting race factor into your decisions, which is why sex education is already common. LGBT education is a useful addition, depending on the format.

Let's say 10% of trans children figure out their identities before puberty because of these lessons. That would be 3/10000th of the population. Costs for treatment, lost hours of productivity, etc. amount to around £100,000. Thus we save an average of £30 per person on these lessons. If these lessons take 2 hours, that's £15 per hour per student. Compare the median hourly wage in the UK of £14 per hour.

Clearly the Taliban isn’t lazy. We can’t beat them. But their army grew up organically and the soldiers are motivated. 

You have to be willing to think of organization as a technology. An army isn’t just 40,000 men. It’s 40,000 men who all relate to each other im very precise, scripted ways, which have been developed with human psychology in mind. That’s why they drill so much. 

&gt;""The first thing in the morning is drill, then drill, then drill again. Then drill, drill, a little more drill. Then drill, and lastly drill. Between drills, we drill, and sometimes stop to eat a little and have roll-call.""

—famous quote from a Union civil war soldier 

Where would they get their military culture from, if they wanted to start an army? They were ruled by the ottomans for hundreds of years. You can give a samurai army guns and do just fine. Making an army from scratch, though? Hard. 

China, thank god, has the same problem developing its navy. Where would they get a navy culture from? They have to develop it. That takes time. 

About a year ago, I heard an interview with a retired navy man working for some think tank. In a rare moment of humor, he was basically making fun of China’s naval exercises. They did a move where they lined up 7 ships in a row to show off their coordination skills. The guy was like, “Yeah, that was cool... in the 1800s.”

2314,"Yes, a wage at PPP is worth much more then the nominal value in Eastern Europe. Think of the rents which are far smaller in EE than in the west. Local services cost much less and so on.

That doesn't mean that it is not better, given a level of PPP, to have a higher nominal value precisely because of the things you said: going abroad, things that cost the same everywhere, etc

""Also, literally every single one country to the west of V4 and eastern Europe has still better wages adjusted PPP.""

I didn't make this claim, but you are wrong: Portugal has a lower average wage at PPP than all EE countries in EU, but Slovakia. And Greece which was part of the EU15 has it lower than all EE countries in EU.

2318,"I agree about the difficulty to work with Arab armies, but I don't think this is caused by the individuals being lazy and cowardly, but by the fact that they have divided loyalties, religious, tribal, political and others and often hate their regimes.

I mean, come on, the comparison between Japan in WW2 and Iraq 2003 is silly. Japenese were brainwashed, thinking they are a superior race and that their emperor is god, they fought for the wrong side, acted like barbarians towards conquered civilian populations and captured enemy soldiers and with their stubborness they caused immense suffering to themselves and others.

Iraqis in 2003 knew they were fighting an enemy who is militarily superior in conventional warware and also an enemy that isn't coming the exterminate them and their family, isn't even coming to loot and conquer their country and impose their own rule on them forever. It merely comes to do a regime change. A regime that many of them hate either way. Or at least don't identify with it. Why should they fight then? They made a logical choice surrendering. It's really about the motivation.

Arabs live in countries with whom they often don't identify or identify just weakly. Belonging to a specific clan or tribe is often way more important. Or to a specific religious/ethnic mimority. On the top of that their armies are full of nepotism and favouritism, that goes hand in hand with that tribal identificiation.

Their countries are just set up all wrong, which is something France and the UK contributed to with their colonialism that they kept going with divide and rule tactics.

The individuals aren't useless though and if you identify a cohesive enough group, like the YPG for example, you can work with them relatively well. Russians have managed to work with SAA too.

But yes, I can understand the scepticism towards the engagement in the Middle East. To be honest I expect you to scale down there eventually as you now don't need oil from there. I mean, you have a mere symbollic presence in Syria by now. And Trump clearly does not want to go in a war with Iran.

As for your last remark - Eastern Europe isn't the UK though. Geopolitically but also culturally we are not as close to you as they are. Most Americans don't even know anything about us. We are more like distant cousins, not really a close family.

2554,"I’m going to go line by line and try to explain my point.

You make a false equivalent where you compare students forced to wear Scientologist head gear to the Islamic hijab. Who even said anyone was being forced to do anything? Regardless of what the behavior is, forced behavior is generally wrong, nobody is advocating for forced anything. The drafters of that law are actually forcing Muslims to take their hijab off. 

You assume that the hijab is meant to indoctrinate. Honestly, if you would have said that Muslim girls where the Hijab as a result of the Hijab it would have been a much more logical argument but still incorrect argument. How you think it’s created to indoctrinate doesn’t even make sense. Trust me if a few Muslim girls in Paris or Los Angeles (where I live) decide to wear the hijab to school French and American people aren’t going to all of a sudden be converting to Islam by the thousands. I’ve literally never heard or read about anyone who saw a hijab and got indoctrinated. That’s pure fear mongering used to hide racist beliefs.

You claim you don’t believe public schools should be a center for religious organizations of any kind? I agree with you. But how does wearing a hijab make it a center for religious organizations. Nobody is coming to public schools to convert students. Students are not to talk about religion. Schools are not promote any religion. With your logic would you prevent Jews from eating pork? Why are they practicing their religion at school? Would you no longer have Christmas as a holiday? What message is the public school sending by giving that day off but not for other religions. OF COURSE NOT! Not giving Christmas off or not allowing Jews to practice their dietary guidelines would be utterly ridiculous. 

Next you claim, schools have become Muslim schools? Does their mere presence somewhere automatically make it a Muslim school? Muslim school would have a period of time where the call to prayer is made and students all go pray. A Muslim school would serve no pork in the cafeteria. A Muslim school would have a Koran in every classroom. It’s obvious you’re very prejudicial and masking it with the facade that you’re a “moderate”. 

You don’t support the ban but you’re not against it. I mean come on I’m not even gonna explain that.

Extremism is a problem I agree. Most Muslims have integrated in Europe, however there are Muslims who obviously have not. I’m not going to go into whose fault that is. It’s probably society’s fault and those Muslims who haven’t integrated. School is one of the best places to become part of society and to learn about your fellow citizen. You think taking away the hijab will just delete extremism? You effectively shunned them away. When a person thinks I can’t even where a hijab even if I’m not forcing religion on anyone they don’t feel accepted as part of society, now you’ve created a biggger gap. Some Muslims who want to continue wearing the hijab will go to a private Muslim school where they can, again further alienating them. I’ve written countless thesis papers on this very topic and the evidence overwhelmingly supports my stance. Also, just to inform you extremist Islamist groups LOVE the ban. I’ve seen their propaganda and it says “Your government doesn’t accept you, you were a moderate Muslim and how did that work for you. They will let other religions practice their religion but you cannot. They partitioned the entire Middle East according to their needs, then they invade your home, and then they wonder why you come to Europe and they push you away.

You guys have this mentality that we loved sucking Turkish cock yet you seem to ignore how the Albanian language was the only language banned in the empire while Serbs and Greeks had their own schools teaching their language.

Lots of Serbs and Greeks even converted but you didn't give a fuck about your own kin and harassed and expelled them and they prefer living with Bosniaks instead.

2638,"&gt;Illegal doesn’t mean shit if 90% of the people dissagree. Laws, power and politics ultimately derives its relevance from the support of the people.

Laws exist to keep order. Imagine if these laws didn't exist. I mean, do you also support the annexation of Crimea? The secession of Abkhazia and S. Ossetia? Perhaps that of us here in RS? Maybe Catalonia? What else?

&gt;Louis XVI was the “legal” owner of the whole of France. The legality of it became irrelevant as soon as 90% of the people said “no”.

Yes, which broke of the time. Though the modern laws are stamped in the UN, a much higher authority.

&gt;Face it, the people of Kosovo do not want to be part of Serbia. And no laws going to change that. You’d have to displace or kill them to kill Kosovo. You’re best bet is siding with Russia in that case because no other country will support another genocide.

Many people in many regions don't want to be or didn't want to be a part of some country but were forced. In just Yugoslavia, think of us Bosnian Serbs, or the Serbs in Croatia. Why didn't we and they get the right to independence when we clearly wanted it, yet the Croats, Bosniaks and now Kosovo Albanians get it? Hypocrisy much?

2641,"&gt; Headscarves and niqabs weren't even a common thing in Islam until salafism started spreading.

Hijab (in various shapes) was a common and dominating thing through nearly whole Islamic world and history. However, there was a period when it disappeared, generally 1950s-60s (sometimes earlier, e.g. Turkey 1930s-70s). However, while it pretty much disappeared in some countries, in others it was limited to major cities / elites. That's why you have these ""Tehran 1970 vs 1990"" photo comparisons, but what is lacking there is Tehran e.g. 1920, and Tehran vs e.g. Meshed or Qom.

However, niqab (or face covering in general) is indeed a new (since 1980s / Islamist ""renewal"") thing in some Islamic countries, like Indonesia/Malaysia or Western Africa.",Pomorze-𝔓𝔬𝔪𝔪𝔢𝔯𝔢𝔩𝔩𝔢𝔫-Pòmòrskô,/r/europe/comments/bp9mzg/austria_approves_headscarf_ban_in_primary_schools/enu0e4t/,pothkan,1558050312

2644,"&gt; You have any way of proving that? Just statistically that seems kind of hard considering 2,5 million Muslims live in the UK, out of 66 million people. So even if all Muslims were hyper radical Salafists, you're not really looking at that large of a group.

https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/11/british-muslims-strong-sense-of-belonging-poll-homosexuality-sharia-law

Honestly, have you even been in the UK? Visited places like Bradford or Luton?

&gt;Yeah such a massive difference between wearing a scarf and a heavy knit sweater. 

Key difference being that one is a tool of systemized misogyny and oppression against women, and the other is just a sweater.

&gt;And otherwise you're probably aware of the widespread systematized sex abuse and anti-abortion practices to the level of prevent girls from getting certain medication because they would have to take contraceptives across in Ireland. Or the dug up mass graves found in the Magdalene Laundries?

I'm very glad that you've picked up on that, and I'm happy that you see it as a significant issue that needs to be addressed, but it's not mutually exclusive with opposing sexist practices like the hijab. You can be upset about both issues, y'know?

&gt;You dont really understand. In somewhere like Poland, if Jane Austin marries John Smith, she becomes basically Smith's Jane. -ova, as in Panchartova for example, is ""Panchart's"", while the men would be Panchart.

Except that in Poland it's literally because the surnames are gendered. 

https://kehilalinks.jewishgen.org/kolbuszowa/resources13.html

The -ski at the end of a typical Polish surname is a formative adjective, from the Proto-Slavic ""ьskъ"", which defined affiliation to something. In the past it was used to denote nobility (Jan of Tarnow -&gt; Jan Tarnowski), but now it's just a popular form of surnames. The Polish language has a grammatical gender system; masculine–feminine–neuter. -ski is the masculine form of the suffix, and -ska is simply the feminine form, nothing more and nothing less. 

If Anna Kowalska decides to marry Jan Pawlak and take his surname after marriage, she becomes Anna Pawlak. There's no arbitrary '-ova' added to the end, because it just doesn't happen. Maybe in Czech, certainly not in Polish.

I think it's you who doesn't quite get it, considering your woeful lack of understanding of linguistics.

&gt;Well you guys are arguing that every Hijab is literally forced on a girls head everywhere under threat of physical violence or something apparently, and there is no chance that this is just a genuine way of expressing faith for these women.

With something that has that much sexist baggage it's quite a fair assumption. Again, no-one is saying that there aren't any women who wear the hijab voluntarily, everyone is merely pointing out (correctly) that it's a form of oppression against women.

&gt;What? As I pointed out with the Slavic surname example, you can trace back just about anything to some sexist origin.

Except Slavic surnames don't have a sexist origin, and if you're so sure about that then give me a few examples. What's the sexist origin of trains? What's the sexist origin of playing cards? What's the sexist origin of rubber bands?

&gt;If you can cite that majority of girls/women wearing the hijab/niqab/whatever in Europe are doing it because they'll be stoned to death otherwise, I'd be really happy.

https://womenintheworld.com/2016/12/12/woman-who-got-death-threats-for-posting-photo-not-wearing-a-hijab-arrested-in-saudi-arabia/

Imagine being raised in such a toxic cultural background, where not wearing a rag over your head would result in death threats, arrests, social ostracisation, etc. At that point women are just culturally conditioned to wear them if they want to fit in, regardless of whether they want to wear it or not.

&gt;You really dont see how you are taking away equality by forcing one group to not wear an article of clothing based on their faith?

In a school children are supposed to be equal, the principle of which is also reflected in school uniforms. What kind of message does it set when certain people receive special privileges whereas others do not? Equality can only occur in two ways: either everyone is allowed to wear headwear in class, or nobody is. No arbitrary privileges, just equality.

&gt;And again, you have no proof they are being forced to wear the hijab, niqab etc. anymore than Western society forcing girls to adhere to fashion standards.

2666,"&gt;No I may not, as laws should be based on what ought to be, not on what is.

That's how you get dictators. Laws are practical solutions for the problems of living together, obviously, and they will be as imperfect as the world we live in.

&gt;Women should be allowed to wear what they want to wear.

There's ample precedent of restrictions on student clothing. Were where you to protest the very common rules against headwear in the classroom, or for that matter in a church, before?

The answer is that you don't particularly care about the freedom, you just have a stereotypical image of muslims as victims, and want to stroke your ego by picking the victim side. 

&gt;Whether there is currently societal pressure is irrelevant for that.

Why do you say societal pressure when I said community pressure? It's a problem originating in particular community.

Of course it's relevant - if there is, for example, community pressure on temp agencies to not send immigrant workers, then a rule against that will reduce discrimination. Even though people like you might claim that it harms the freedom of the temp agencies and their customers.

&gt;The point is that you don't have to pick.

Of course you do. Either you allow the forced unity of the muslim community forcing ""their"" women to wear hijabs, or you implement rules that prevent it. Doing nothing is picking the former.

&gt;I've answered it - you didn't accept the answer. Because, as said above, you seem to believe that there are only ever two possible options. But morality isn't just a series of Trolley Problems.

Like I said above, it's a thought experiment to make clear that motivations don't matter to judge the harm or good done by an action. That's the whole reasoning that supports the justice system: potential criminals don't have to *like* the intended behaviour, if they refrain from committing crimes out of fear of punishment, that's good enough.

&amp;#x200B;

art 7 is meaningless, if one of those western countries dont want to have their money sent to EE anymore, that will happen.

they cannot be forced to pay, they literally pay for the EU to function, the officials in Brussel know they cant push these countries to the brink because they know they cannot afford another net contributor and most likely a founding member to leave the EU.

it would be a giant blow if a founding member were to leave the EU.

its during these times that the EU is in the most danger of falling apart.

and even if art 7 is triggered against say NL or FR.

they will protect each other, because they are all fed up with paying so much into the EU, the same anti EU talking points made in the UK during the Brexit campaign can be used in France, especially during the anger of the Yellow vests, people have no idea how close France actually is to leaving the EU in practice, ideologically, they have already left, and if the vote was held today, France would leave.

&amp;#x200B;

there are no mechanism held in place to keep a member state in line, 

there are i mean, but they cannot be enforced.

PL and HU proved that and have set the standard, they set the precedent.

you would be naive to think the far right in the west has not been paying attention.

they'll act all buddy buddy with each other because they are ideologically similar, but when push comes to shove, and they need to help the economically weaker ones in the east, they will all stab eachother in the back, and the only victors will be the north, because they are the ones with the money.

and the east literally depends on the west to survive, most of their trade is with the west, so if the EU goes, the east will go through a crisis that will make the Greek crisis look like a kindergarten fieldtrip.

they have no friend in Russia, and China would use them like playtoys, the US would use them as barriers for Russia.

&amp;#x200B;

no one can deny this.

PL and HU may have just handed the far right in the west the blueprints on how to detroy the EU and the east.

&gt;The use of forced labour and slavery in Nazi Germany and throughout German-occupied Europe during World War II took place on an unprecedented scale.[2] It was a vital part of the German economic exploitation of conquered territories. It also contributed to the mass extermination of populations in German-occupied Europe. The Nazi Germans abducted approximately 12 million people from almost twenty European countries; about two thirds came from Central Europe and Eastern Europe.[1] Many workers died as a result of their living conditions – mistreatment, malnutrition, and torture were the main causes of death. They became civilian casualties of shelling.[3] At its peak the forced labourers comprised 20% of the German work force. Counting deaths and turnover, about 15 million men and women were forced labourers at one point during the war.",Lesser Poland (Poland),/r/europe/comments/bp8dki/national_day_of_the_abolition_of_slavery/enszqgw/,Hapiness_and_Freedom,1558035529

And later restored by Napoleon, as someone else pointed out.

However, there is an interesting and lesser known fact: slavery was actually permanently abolished in France as early as **1315**, following a royal decree of [Louis X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_X_of_France) outright outlawing it, and proclaiming that any slave setting foot on the soil of France was legally freed.

The decree was never abolished, and was actually enforced in a 1571 trial in Bordeaux that freed African slaves that found themselves on French soil.

Slavery was however legal in (most) French colonies, as those territories were not part of France strictly speaking.",🇫🇷 Europe,/r/europe/comments/bp8dki/national_day_of_the_abolition_of_slavery/ent007f/,Orravan_O,1558035624

It's hard to summarize all the facts and projections in a Reddit post, nor do I have time to do that, but the pretty much consensus picture regarding convergence between WE and CEE is that so far it has happening at a good pace, and it may continue in the future if (significant) middle-income trap risks don't materialize. I think this recent FT article sums it up well: https://on.ft.com/2Q9hI3R - although there are many asterisks one could make in that article as well, so it may not convince you.

I think relation between a perceived regional mentality and economic growth is bollocks, and largely just a vehicle to push forward stereotypes. I am not aware of any proven link between protestant ethics and economic growth, although there is scientific work on relation between protestant ethics and the emergence of modern capitalism (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Protestant_Ethic_and_the_Spirit_of_Capitalism) - as a form of structuring a society, that is. This is very different.

CEE receives a significant amount from EU, but since most of it is spent on infrastructure, i.e. asphalt, it (1) does not push wages up as jobs created are low wage, (2) is not necessarily all used in the country - a lot goes into buying raw materials, sometimes from abroad. So how much it contributes to economic growth is uncertain to me. May be a lot, may be a little. I wondered if you know any articles/charts that show this. I'm very interested.",,/r/europe/comments/bovstv/eurostat_gdp_growth_rate_2019_q1_yy/ent06wk/,teimons,1558035691

Though it is not the government telling them to wear it, to argue they are free to choose is a bit of a lie of omission. The government, unable to go into the home to ensure such things don't happen, is attempting to limit the soft cultural pressure by banning the wearing of the item to prevent it from being used as a tool to reinforce cultural practices that are limiting to women. If women historically  were forced to weqr literal shackles instead of metaphorical ones, would you protest their limitation?

If the goal was only to clearly hate and oppress the minority, why LIMIT visibility by banning an item of clear association when every historical example of persecution tends to instead make them entirely visible and unable to hide their affiliation?

2909,"&gt;Regardless of whether Russia's feeling threatened, their policy is not even hinting at reconciliation. As such we have to assume that anything that's good for Russia is bad for us. This wasn't necessarily the case ten years ago, but it is now. Unless Russia changes it will remain that way.

Of course, cause there can hardly be any reconciliation sadly. That window passed.

&gt;Russia is also not a superpower. Not like the US is. Trading the US for Russia would be a poor choice of alliances. Especially considering the lack of trust between the EU and Russia. Distancing ourselves from the US in the hopes of getting closer to Russia does not mean that Russia actually will align with the EU. We could very well end up simply serving Russia and China's interests by splitting.

But a needed one. The EU is no superpower either. It's been beneath the US for a long time, it's been its lackey in many situations. But it's still strong. Strong enough that if it allied itself with Russia it could stand up to the US. 

&gt;Beyond all that, even if Russia were allied with the rest of Europe, we'd absolutely want to be on good terms with the US, because the greater long term rival is China, not Russia. With Russia on our side (Russia, a liberal democracy? I have my doubts.) We could concentrate on containing China, together with US, Japan and India, but primarily the US. There's no way Russia can get along with Europe and not with the US so long as the situation with China remains what it is.

True, China is the superpower of the future. But the US is the current one and will fight hard to keeps its hegemony, including that over the EU. The Russians will still see the US as an enemy, so a three part alliance between the US, Russia and EU is very unlikely to ever happen, as things stand Russia will rather align itself with China against the US and EU. If the EU took a different course, it and Russia could be standing united against the US and China in a threeway. As for Russia being a liberal democracy, it doesn't need to be one to be friends with the EU. You don't have to agree on everything.",Rep.

2989,"&gt; So I'd not concentrate on minimum wage much.  

I would, since that's what damn near everyone earns. I understand other countries don't necessarily go by minimum wage as the regular wage, but ours does.  

&gt;Also, if I compared rents with minimum wage, I'd look at the smallest rent you can get something live-able for, not the highest rent, as you seem to imply you do by saying ""room can go up to 300€""  

I imply that because there's cheaper zones. I can live in Porto, Lisbon and many other places where that's what the rent will cost. I'm not implying that's the most expensive, I'm implying that's the norm. Just like there's much higher than 400€ you can also go to the eastern (internal) part of the country where a fraction of the people live and damn near no companies are stationed, but that's not where people go.  

You seem to think I'm listing rent prices of, for example, California and NY when I'm just listing off the norm. Just like there's much more rural areas as a lower exception, places like California and NY would be a higher-end exception.  

I actually live in a cheaper than usual area (in terms of rent price) and I have friends and know other people who rent out in various parts of the country, including Lisbon, so I know that, for example, Lisbon is much more expensive than the rest, but when I go to the outskirts and even different districts and they're circling 300-400€ with the wages remaining the exact same, I know it's an issue.  

&gt;I think you always need to make compromises in politics :) I'll vote for a party that has not expressed explicit support for LGBT rights (although not expressed support for ""traditional family"" as well) because I like their economic policies more than those of parties that have explicitly voiced support for LGBT.  

That's fair and I did think about it, but even so I only had 3 topics which I wanted to align. If the first one dis-aligns it's out of corruption or lack of information on their part, so I'm not voting for them because of the importance I place on it but because of what their vote implies, and the other two.

3013,"&gt;I'm not here to defend or condone Antifa's action, 

After reading your entire comment, it's pretty clear you're lying here. You're definitely trying to justify their actions.

&gt;but it seems to me that either you don't really know what Antifa is or does, or you are deliberately misrepresenting them to just play at ""Both sides are bad"".

You can call me ignorant all you want, but i'm well aware of Antifa's actions. There is much much more evidence of their violent behaviour than just the undeniable evidence i showed you. You can find whole compilations of Antifa assaulting people and journalists on Youtube. 

I'm not saying anything about both sides being bad, as we're talking exclusively about Antifa here. I'm saying that Antifa is a violent group of political extremists. I'm far from alone in this, as the US security agencies themselves refer to them as domestic terrorists.

&gt; They just take it a step further with their ""By any means necessary"".

That's exactly it. They view it as justified to force their will ""by any means necessary"", which is exactly why they're violent extremists. Anyone who shares that mindset are violent extremists, when they believe themselves to be above the law, because they have internally justified their violent actions. They apply labels to people whenever it is convenient for them, in order to justify their actions, they don't care if it's truthful. 

Andy Ngo isn't a facist. Maggie Vespa of KGW news isn't a facist. The KATU news photographer isn't a facist. Genevieve Reaume isn't a facist. The vast majority of the people Antifa threatens, assaults and doxxes aren't facists at all.

&gt; Those actions can be taken by any political ideology. It's not inherently ""fascist"". Literally every political and economical system on the planet has, at one point of another, ""violently suppressed freedom of speech"". 

The forcible surpression of opposition is a fundamental part of the facism's playbook. I'm not calling Antifa facists, as i'm not going incorrectly label everyone like you've done in your comment, because they aren't facists. However, they're more akin to facists in the tactics they employ than many of the people they're assaulting, threatening and doxxing. 

&gt; Spare me of this fake victim-ism. People who claim this always fail to mention ""what kind of opinions are Antifascists fighting against"". Thinking that Liberals are not Leftists is not the same as ""Antifa hates me because i want to murder black people"". That's not ""just an opinion"". 

This is honestly just a disgusting response. I've shown you evidence of Antifa assaulting innocent people, and you're completely dismissing it. None of those people ""want to murder black people"". Stop being ridiculous. You have no evidence for that claim at all.

&gt; They are not an organization. Yes, they cover their faces because they fear being persecuted by those that they are attacking, or that the media can use their faces to attack them personally. 

Of course they fear being persecuted by those that they're attacking, *because they're attacking them*. I don't know if you noticed, but assaulting people isn't legal. You're also correct that they're afraid of being exposed by the media for their criminal behaviour. That was exactly my point.

&gt; I'm just going to [leave](https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2009/09/24/G20_Summit_Protests_Live2_s878x614.jpg?acbfb6474c8353f796c0e1cfdac8813435ab5c2b) these [pictures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balaclava_(clothing)#/media/File:Task_Force_Police_officer_in_Sweden.jpg) of the Police here. 

Are you seriously equating the lawful police force with a bunch of violent extremists assaulting people? You have to be kidding me. The police is wearing helmets to protect themselves from violent people, such as Antifa.

&gt; I couldn't find a single source that confirms this. Feel free to prove me wrong.  Not that it would matter anyways, the USA has a long history of criminalizing any progressive (or perceived progressive) movements. 

[What about this left wing source?](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/antifa-domestic-terrorists-us-security-agencies-homeland-security-fbi-a7927881.html) It's really not difficult to find dozens of articles stating the same thing. It has this following paragraph showing the extent of Antifa's violent behaviour:

* *A confidential intelligence report by the DHS and the FBI accused the ""anarchist extremists"" of attacks on police, government and political institutions, along with any other symbols of the ""capitalist system"" or displays of racism, social injustice or fascism.*  

&gt; Andy Ngo : An islamophobe 

What a load of crap. You're doing the same thing as Antifa, which is to label people recklessly in order to justify assaulting them. He's not an islamophobe. The single opinion piece that you provided isn't even remotely close to backing up your claim. The piece simply disagrees with his article. Your ""damning"" quote is simply him claiming in his own article that London to him is an example of failed multiculturalism.

&gt; But since you provided a single link to a Twitter page, let's see that one, shall we? 

The Twitter thread showed several incidents of different journalists being assaulted by Antifa. You have only tried to justify the assault of one of them, while conveniently ignoring the rest, as you know it's not even remotely possibly to justify it. 

&gt; without talking about ""Patriot Prayer""

Why would he? They didn't assault him. 

They're also not a national group, but only a small local group that isn't even remotely the same size as Antifa. Why do you keep bringing up other organizations? We're talking about Antifa here. You're the one trying to play ""muh both sides"" here, yet claim i am. I don't care about other organizations in this discussion, as we're specifically talking about Antifa.

3017,"&gt; Such as?

A monetary union without a proper banking and fiscal union (including transfers) simply doesn't work. The EU is comprised of many different countries, each with their own economies. Because of the single currency, there is a one size fits all monetary policy which can only be tailored to the eurozone average, never specific problems in individual member states. Without control of monetary policy, a country does not have meaningful control over it's economy since it has no tools to react the economy running too hot or too cold (even on the fiscal side, the EU gives member states very little leeway through the Growth and Stability Pact).

Additionally, the euro creates a competitive inbalance between countries like Germany and Italy. Without the euro, Germany would use the Deutsche Mark and their current account would necessarily make their exports more expensive and less appealing. Without the euro, Italy would still be using the Lira which would have been relatively weaker than the Euro and allowed them to remain more globally competitive. In particular, Italian products are more sensitive to international competition and if they had their own central bank they could devalue to maintain an edge. 

But, more importantly than all, the euro constrains countries from meaningfully addressing their debt levels. The periphery states (in particular Italy and Greece) have no influence over inflation (because they have no control over monetary policy) and therefore their debt burden will remain precariously high for as long as they remain in the eurozone. There is absolutely no chance that Italy gets it debt to gdp down to a more reasonable level before the next major crisis, and when that happens it may breach 140% and then it's game over, compound interest will do the rest. 

&gt; The euro was put through one of the worst possible scenario's and didn't collapse. 

Really showing that you have no idea what you are talking about. The crisis was severe but far from a worst case scenario. Importantly, Italy did not need to bailed out. A real crisis comes when Italy loses control of its debt. For context, Italy has more debt than any other EU member state; more than Greece, Spain, Portugal, Ireland and Belgium *combined*. There is not enough money in the ESM to bailout Italy in a bonafide crisis. Think of what a mess Greece was, now reflect that Italy has 15 times more debt than Greece - and is far, far more interconnected with and  important to the European economy. 

Portugal's debt is still 125%, Greece over 180%; France, Belgium and Spain all around 100%. When the next major slump arrives, all of these are going to shoot up. Greece is unambiguously fucked, Italy stands on the precipice and if she goes, the rest go with her. That's a much bigger problem than in 2011. 

&gt; the lira, drachme and belgian frank would have been wiped out

If all those countries had their own independent monetary policy and free floating currencies, they could devalue their debt to more sustainable levels. Even in a crisis, they could default without dragging the rest of Europe down with them. 

&gt; The euro is on the brink of collapse"" has been the headline so many times 

It was in the headline so much because, in many ways, the sovereign debt crisis of the early 2010s was a near a run thing. They came close to losing control and basically fudged their way through without actually solving many of the issues that led them to that episode. 

&gt; ""GBP will collapse before EUR""

The EUR has been around for only 20 years, Sterling has been around for hundreds. How do you suggest that it will collapse? Not under the weight of the national debt, since the country can print its way out of that problem. 

As for the EUR, we'll see how the current slowdown pans out, but if Trump does start his trade war with the EU that will be 3 recessions in 10 years for the eurozone - a thoroughly miserable record by an measure.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/bp5u5h/majority_of_europeans_expect_end_of_eu_within_20/enrwblr/,MyFavouriteAxe,1558020998

3211,"&gt; especially during those times would react in the same way. 

You seem to imply you have a different standard for behavior for people's in the 40s, but only seem to extend that courtesy to one side. For example, you seem to imply that immigrants had less rights to the land they purchased, were born in, even though exercising those rights (including self determination) were more accepted then.



&gt;Their leadership refused to acknowledge legitimacy of even talking about such, like many did for various stuff through the history. Was that a wrong tactic? Sure. Was that inheritely wrong or immoral to do? Not really.

It was of course morally wrong! If the Palestinians had engaged in talks perhaps Israel would have been a tiny coastal city (again, built on empty sand dunes) - we'll never know because Palestinians never compromised or considered peaceful solutions, which unfortunately people today still defend and even argue for - furthering the 'river to the sea' rhetoric promulgated in the West to this day, which is terrible and encourages unrealistic Palestinian revanchist movements prolonging the conflict.

&gt;It was Israel gaining lands, then Palestinians and Arabs resisting, Israel winning the war and expending as they wanted, then again Israel continued to expand, and more, and today still more.

Before the civil war, Jewish people bought land from the owners

* 
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_land_purchase_in_Palestine

Second, the actual loss of Palestinian homes by force 
 occurred during the Mandate Civil War started by Palestinians after the UN vote.

Your ""gaining land, losing land"" sequence is a slogan devoid of context which is the only way your narrative can stand. I can link to Jewish land purchases, the Mandate Civil War, the two different 'one state' and 'two-state' UNSCOP plans while you can only give context-less slogans because the actual recorded in history details don't fit your *""summary""* of what happened.

The historical record shows a series on bribes, diplomatic pressure, threats and even war by Britain to enforce its anti-slavery stance on other countries.

Probably no other country could at the time because Britain was the global hegemonic power.   

And yes you can argue that Britain only had the money and the ships to do this thanks to slavery and there would be some truth in that. It doesn't change the fact that no other country contributed more to abolition that the UK.

The ""problem"" is that we have higher laws that everyone must be treated the same so you can't just ban one religion that you want to get rid of - or force to become more moderate like the other local religions - but have to target all, especially since we in Austria kind of have some backstory with attacking single religions.    

If Islam (or the practicers in our local microcosm, my experience in Vienna is very much unwillingness to integrate) don't become moderate on their own, such actions become necessary.

Jeez!

Exaggerating events does not elevate the heros, it only diminish them, by making their endeavors into a fable.

Nuclear reactors are not bombs. Period. You can't rig it to be one. You can't accident do something that make it one. 

Any explosions is one caused by steam, like an steam cooker with a blocked valve. You saw what happen in FKS - did the explosions *wipe* out Half of Japan? How big a pressure cooker do you need to wipe out half a continent?

How come the first explosion did not *wipe out* half of Europe, or even quatre ? But the second one would have?

And then there is the fallout - *making it riskier to live for 500,000 years*! 
There is nothing supernatural about fallout spreads. Wind/water carries it around like, like everything else. It get diluted the further away.  At some point it's so dilute, its risk will be outweighed by risks of everyday life. 

Have you seen what Chernobyl look like now? Does it look like a barren waste land or a forest reserve?

3447,"I quite frequently see similar posts claiming either that there is no convergence between WE and CEE, or that it is very slow and it will take many decades for WE and CEE to fully converge.

The reality is different. Lithuania, where I am from, already has a GDP PPP per capita that's 80% of EU average, and it is (so far) continuing to grow significantly faster than the EU average. European Commission projects Lithuania to reach EU average GDP PPP per capita in 1-2 decades. Here, we are talking about the country as a whole, including really impoverished provinces. In bigger cities, GDP PPP per capita is already above average in EU.

I've also heard opinions that GDP PPP is a distorting measure that does not reflect quality of life. I find that hard to believe. In practice, local price levels determine how much a person can save and what they can afford. I know quite a few examples of people in Vilnius having more money (in nominal terms) after rent and other basic expenses than people in London at comparable jobs.

There are challenges ahead before CEE fully catches up with WE, namely the middle income trap. CEE is at risk of it because salaries have been growing at a faster rate than labour productivity for a while, and low or negative net migration combined with low fertility increases old age dependant share in the population. However, there is reasonable chance the issues will be overcome at least in some CEE countries - it all depends on local and EU politicians.

I strongly believe the really problematic region of EU is Southern, not Eastern Europe. There, we have had a decade of economic stagnation, and things don't seem to improve fast enough. Multiple CEE countries already surpassed Greece and even Portugal by GDP PPP per capita, Italy and Spain are likely to be next in a few years time.",,/r/europe/comments/bovstv/eurostat_gdp_growth_rate_2019_q1_yy/enqc3ju/,teimons,1557992803

\&gt;For the next several days, as emergency crews tried desperately to  contain the fires and radiation leaks, the death toll climbed as plant  workers succumbed to acute radiation sickness.

\&gt;Most of the radiation released from the failed nuclear reactor was from  iodine-131, cesium-134 and cesium-137. Iodine-131 has a relatively  short half-life of eight days, according to UNSCEAR, but is rapidly  ingested through the air and tends to localize in the thyroid gland.  Cesium isotopes have longer half-lives (cesium-137 has a half-life of 30  years) and are a concern for years after their release into the  environment.

Why would they start printing like crazy? In any case, it's irrelevant if you have an economic structure like the US has. Highly competitive globally. Worst case scenario they end up like Japan. Somehow you think everyone else can avoid this ''printing''? We have been in a QE war for some time now. If one inflates, the others have no choice but to follow.

3523,"&gt; Perhaps youve heard the term Sabra, but many many Jewish people in the Mandate had been born there, including many famous Israelis like Yitzhak Rabin, Yigal Allon etc.

Being born there means first generation immigrants. Sure there are also ones directly i immigrated.

&gt; This is the worst part of your argument and reflects the bigotry against Palestinians people resort to to try to argue for them.

&gt; Palestinians are human beings not animals, ""simply reacting"" is a disgusting standard to hold any group of humans to.

Humans are social animals, and societies and communities do react, even though they're not monolithic. Simply, any group under such circumstances, especially during those times would react in the same way. Israeli Jews wouldn't do anything different if they're put in similar circumstances right now.

&gt; Conflicts all over the world have the expectation that both sides must sit at a table and use words and make compromises. Saying Palestinians didn't or couldn't do the same is an argument with a very nasty logical corollary that Palestinians couldn't have resolved the conflict through negotiations and acted like some kind of reptile rather than the people with humanity they are.

There wasn't a ""conflict"" but an attempt to divide their lands and give it to someone else. Their leadership refused to acknowledge legitimacy of even talking about such, like many did for various stuff through the history. Was that a wrong tactic? Sure. Was that inheritely wrong or immoral to do? Not really.

&gt; You can keep saying that and glossing over how that step came about, the failure to engage in words over violence that preceded Israel's expansion, but **I** consider it a over simplified propaganda and *history records exactly what happened before Israel expanded (a war launched by Palestinians and Arabs, and a failure to sit down, literally, with their opponents)*

3536,"In 2016, one in ten enterprises in the European non-financial business economy belonged to the tourism industries. These 2.4 million enterprises employed 13.6 million people, accounting for 10% of the persons employed in the non-financial business economy and 22% of persons employed in the services sector.

Tourism industries do not provide services only to tourists. The number of people employed, turnover, etc. is also related to services provided to non-tourists, for example restaurants. The subcategories 'mainly tourism' and 'partially tourism' are used to take this into account.

Between 2012 and 2016, tourism industries (mainly and partially) showed a stronger growth than the total economy in relation to the number of enterprises, turnover, value added and persons employed.

Looking at those industries that are 'mainly tourism', between 2012 and 2016 the number of enterprises grew by 19% to 405,000, the turnover by 13%, the value added recorded a growth of 28%, and the number of persons employed increased by 10%. For the total economy the corresponding growth rates were 9%, 5%, 16% and 6% respectively.

""Turkish properties in the south are managed by a Cypriot government agency. Some homes are lived in by Greek Cypriot displaced, although there have been instances where they were forced to leave once Turkish Cypriots asked for their land back.""

I can't see any Turkish Cypriots returning in those. Again, I've lived in the island for some time, and still have many Turkish Cypriot friends and whatnot. My own academic studies also covers conflits in Europe so not like I don't have an easy access to such either. I personally don't know a Turkish Cypriot soul got his/her properties back, nor my Turkish Cypriot friends. Their villages are still with Greek Cypriot refugees or under the control of RoC without them being allowed for anything.

Again, let's see Israel giving half of its land to someone else, and we can say how baddies Palestinians were.

&gt; I'm not saying the Palestinians had no rights at all in Palestine, but the Jewish people had rights also and their nationalism could have peacefully and rightfully existed next to Palestinian nationalism, but even negotiations were too much for the Arabs.

I'm not saying Jewish immigrants hadn't had a right to exist there either, but no, there wasn't any right for them to build up a foreign country on the land of others.

Again, what's been done had been done though. 

&gt; The immigrant thing is bs. The human story is a story of migration. The Rhoyinga in Myanmar have rights, and so did the Jewish people in Palestine.

Neither of them have rights to found a separate country on the half of the country. Rhoyinga weren't first generation immigrants either unlike Jews by then. Again, now it's a different matter but still.

&gt; They wanted their own state, but some peace plans included one state with minority sovereignty and rights, **but the Arabs refused any talk at all of Jewish rights in any form.** They wanted to crush Jewish nationalism, even Jewish rights, and were so fixated on this they couldn't even sit down like we expect people all over the world to do to hash out their problems.

Any nation and group would do so, especially around those times. Same goes for Dutch or Israeli Jews now. No one would go and talk about immigrants or anyone having a possible country built up on its own lands.

&gt; Palestinians gambled that they could win by violence,

3642,"&gt; There were ships that were transferring weapons. Estimates are that they were about 10.000 weapons. This was not for ""defense"" against bad GCs. This was a force preparation

In 1950s, sure. After 1963, again, sure. Between 1960-63, neither the short lived military rule nor the following govts given any weapons. Denktas was paranoid and sure tried to find weapons, but basically TMT wasn't actively until 1963, and no one given any weapons to anyone. Even by 1963, Turkish Cypriot students in Turkey, UK and US who got into Erenköy weren't provided weapons by İnönü but they bought those themselves. Basic excuse and narration for weapons to be smuggled has always been about ""defence"" by the way. Turkish Cypriots weren't trying to seize the govt or anything, nor Dentas was crazy enough to try that.

&gt; There were ships that were transferring weapons. Estimates are that they were about 10.000 weapons. This was not for ""defense"" against bad GCs. This was a force preparation

Sadly true, but Turkish Cypriots were never for Turkey to take over the island, nor many Greek Cypriots weren't for living under Greece after some point either. Cypriot flag was considered as a joke, and it had been always other two flags been used but still.

&gt; Everywhere I see him mentioned they don't mention confederation but two states.

They do that, but he knew two states wouldn't work either. What he had in mind was talking about two states with Turkey, and using the federation in agreements, but aiming confederation. He was infamously nicked ""mister No"" when it comes to reunification negotiations, but his own works and also works of his close advisor Mümtaz Soysal points out he was opting for and trying to achieve a confederation, as loose as possible. Of course, that wasn't a thing that Greek Cypriots would agree on.

&gt; GCs don't want to be part of Greece anymore. What you see as Greek domination is what we see as democracy. One citizen one vote. Ok GCs are more than TCs, shall we cull their numbers?

I'm sure they don't. But what Turkish Cypriots do fear about is still that possibility and the possibility of them being singled out by a system. That's also why they're still insisting on quotas, even though they've agreed on one citizen one vote for the parlaiment but wanted to continuum of the old 1/4 quotas for a upper house in negotiations, and veto rights, alongside with quotas in the police forces, fire brigades and supreme court.

&gt; It failed because it could not function, and because it was a tool for Turkey to control the island. I think this is the 3rd time I mention it to you. Makarios sent a letter to kucuk and got a reply from Turkey. If this is not proof enough for you I don't know what it is. 

Turkey couldn't have meddled in if it wasn't for Greek Cypriot leadership's failings either. Again, after all these, Kücük was ousted, and Denktas and Turkish Cypriot MPs have agreed to proposals of Makarios and all reforms except the Nicosia Turkish Municipality. It could have functioned but it haven't not just due to Turkey but also Greece and Greek Cypriots. Greek Cypriots were actually blessed with one of the most computable ""other"" community, whom had shared everthing with them but their loose king of religion, and a one that would not do anything in the long run. It was mostly their own failing to have Turkey meddling in on their behalf, and even having Turkey invading the island at the end.

&gt; No it is not only about communal issues, but all issues. Look what Akinci said regarding energy transfer. All in all, I hope Cyprus will not accept to controlled from Turkey through

It's all ends up in communal issues though. What Turkey does is using the process for its own gains. Akinci or anyone else can't single out Turkey either, even though in the very beginning he acted against Turkey's demands and sometimes he still does - and hated by many nationalist Turks for it, since both North Cyprus is dependent on Turkey economically, but also since Turkish Cypriots are still negotiating with Turkey's army and security behind them. If the Cypriot issues can find a solution, rest will be following with Turkish Cypriot leadership not letting Turkey to meddle anymore.

To be honest, I also don't want Turkey to control Cyprus in any means. But Greek Cypriot leadership once acting like if time is on their side, and all other factors aren't helping much.

&gt; It was mostly their own failing to have Turkey meddling in on their behalf, and even having Turkey invading the island at the end.

Well you ll say conspiracy theory again, but the whole thing was planned. Makarios was too left-leaning (nickname was Castro of Mediteranean) in the cold war era for the likings of UK and USA. There are some books that deal with declassified CIA documents. Kisinger said there is no American reason why Turkey should hold 1/3 of the island.

Nope, the first separation happened in 1956 (I was mistaken in the dates). Major Taggart divided the city into two with iron bars and wire,  from Paphos Gate to St. Kassianos. This line of bars/wire was called the Mason-Dixon Line (after something that took place in US civil war). 

&gt; I can't see any Turkish Cypriots returning in those. Again, I've lived in the island for some time, and still have many Turkish Cypriot friends and whatnot. My own academic studies also covers conflits in Europe so not like I don't have an easy access to such either. I personally don't know a Turkish Cypriot soul got his/her properties back, nor my Turkish Cypriot friends. Their villages are still with Greek Cypriot refugees or under the control of RoC without them being allowed for anything.

&gt; There were no arms provided by Turkey within the 1960-63 period. You also don't make a plan to weaken Turkish Cypriots, and for Enosis, and violent subjugation when you are about eliminating such a threat only. Come on.

I am telling you how it started, not how it ended. The weapons they found came from Egypt, Greece ""threw them out"" according to their testimonies.

 Lithuanians formed several units that actively assisted Germans:[\[32\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_occupation_of_Lithuania_during_World_War_II#cite_note-32)

* [Lithuanian Auxiliary Police Battalions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian_Auxiliary_Police_Battalions) – 26 battalions with 13,000 men
* [Lithuanian Construction Battalions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian_Construction_Battalions) – 5 battalions with 2,500 men
* [Lithuanian Territorial Defense Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian_Territorial_Defense_Force) – 10,000–12,000 men
* [Self-Defence units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Self-Defence_in_Lithuania_during_the_Nazi_occupation_(1941%E2%80%9344)) – 3,000 men
* [Homeland Protection Detachment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeland_Protection_Detachment) – 6,000 men

10 of the Lithuanian police battalions, working with the Nazi [Einsatzkommando](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einsatzkommando), were involved in mass killings, they were thought to have executed 78,000 individuals.

The majority of anti-Nazi resistance in Lithuania came from the [Polish partisans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_partisans) and the [Soviet partisans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_partisans). Both began sabotage and guerrilla operations against German forces immediately after the [Nazi invasion of 1941](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Barbarossa). The most important Polish resistance organization in Lithuania was, as elsewhere in [occupied Poland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupied_Poland), the Home Army ([Armia Krajowa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armia_Krajowa)). Polish commander of the Wilno ([Vilnius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilnius)) region was [Aleksander Krzyżanowski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksander_Krzy%C5%BCanowski).""

For one, the US maintains its global influence because of it’s bases in Europe, so if an invasion did happen forces stationed abroad could launch an attack from Europe. 

But say, in a hypothetical scenario, You decide to fuck everyone off and go solo. No more US presence in Europe. Sure you may have key locations in the ME but Europe controls the exit to the Atlantic. The majority of your expeditionary forces are now focussed entirely in Japan and Oceana, but wait, you can manage on your own because you’re the world’s foremost superpower. So you have Guam and Hawaii plus a few places in the Pacific: primary targets for the Chinese. The Chinese invade, your forces are concentrated in key areas near densely populated civilian areas with key infrastructure so they logically focus on destroying those. With no GPS and likely no power grid or critical infrastructure the US would crumble. It may give a good fight but it wouldn’t last. If you want to include Nukes, well, its obvious what would happen. Any victory by the US would be pyrrhic to say the least. 

If that situation happened there wouldn’t be an America anymore. You may not need our military aid but you sure as hell need strategic locations to use your power. Without cooperation between Allies a military quickly turns into a defensive one, rather than one capable of exerting influence. Did you forget about our neighbours to the north as well? Canada is a key contributor to Nato too. 

Focussing back on Spain, they’ve contributed the most out of all EU countries in terms of military involvement in American escapades. Without Rota the US would lack a safe haven if shit hit the fan in the ME. The frigate was on a training mission under the US so how is it in anyway fair to ask them to change their mission and embark on a war? Thats whats utterly shameless. Its like asking the unpaid intern to fill in an executive’s role: it’s not what they signed up for and they’re not profiting from it.

Nato is being undermined not because of Europe but because of Americas softening posture with Russia. The reason why europeans are preparing to become self-reliant militarily is because of the fact that they doubt whether the US would stick up for them. European countries such as Germany and the UK would happily defend the US in the event of armed conflict. Even without nukes being involved the world is too connected for anyone to survive a global conflict anymore, including the US.

Thousands of Belarusian collaborators were killed, including teachers, local administrators and members of the Belarusian Auxiliary Police, and dozens of Polish communities were destroyed. Resulting from this, at least on ten different occasions the Nowogródek District division (pl) of the Armia Krajowa attempted to negotiate with the Soviet partisans to stop the attacks on hapless villages. Those attempts were futile. In May 1943, the entire Polish delegation was murdered by the Soviets in the powiat of Szczuczyn and the pacifications continued. Apart from Naliboki, other massacres were committed in Koniuchy (Koniuchy massacre), Szczepki, Prowżały, Kamień, Niewoniańce, Izabelin, Kaczewo, Babińsk, and Ługomowicze, including murders around Dokudów and near the Narocz and Kromań lakes, as well as in Derewno.

NKVD recruited all difference types of people willing to be partisans, including 162 armed Jews who had no choice (like the other partisans) but to atack whoever they were ordered to.  That is a Jewish massacre of Poles?  I mean it's nothing to be proud of, but it wasn't Jewish organized and directed.

The Konichy massacre had even more attenuated connection to Jews.  They were pro-Soviet partisans who had no lcoal support and had to raid for food, and follow Soviet directions.

Again, nothing to be proud of, but if these are the best examples you can find of ""Jewish"" attacks on Poles, it's hardly saying that there was a widespread Jewish movement to kill Poles.  These were Soviet attacks, and I think you could understand how Jews would want to fight the Nazis in anyway possible.",,/r/europe/comments/bov6do/polish_ambassador_beaten_in_israel/ennnp7o/,Le_Updoot_Army,1557948911

4026,"&gt;Given that people who identified as Jews were willingly keeping their own ethnic identity in spite of serious pressure not to

Some did, particularly religious Jews. Others did everything in their power to assimilate, but that isn't mutually exclusive with identifying as Jew as an *ethnic identity*. The main occupation of the Nazi party after all was to specifically scour through every citizen's ancestry records to find whether or not someone had ethnically Jewish ancestry and then stamp a yellow badge to their chest so they can be ethnically identified, because there were so many who didn't on a day-to-day basis. Hitler hated nothing more than Jews who hid their ethnic identity, and so do anti-semites today.

Also, the only option 'not to keep' your ethnic identity is to basically lie about it, because it's impossible to 'not keep' a part of your DNA. And lying about it won't take the pressure if it's exposed, it will only make things worse for you. There was an option to change your religious identity, but if you're only doing that due to the serious pressure, it won't help much either. You'd be feigning a faith that you do not truly profess and religious authorities will be highly suspicious of you. Conversos in the Spanish Inquisition for example were often monitored, and frequently executed for either real or imagined 'lack of sincerity' or alleged regressions to Judaism.

I agree that most Jews probably would've wanted to be under the sovereignty of a Jewish state no matter what given the usual conditions under Christian sovereignty, but it's not really correct to say that anyone who acknowledged himself as ethnically Jewish when asked was 'willingly' keeping the identity in spite of serious pressure not to. There was never any pressure on Jews during the 20th century to claim they aren't Jews, on the contrary. The pressure was to 'reveal' ethnic ancestries and treat them accordingly.

There was pressure to convert in the middle-ages, but that's religious identity, and it wasn't always easy either.",,/r/europe/comments/bonlkw/resettlement_of_jewish_population_of_poland_in/enno7fy/,Questiori,1557949079

some more info:
“Jews in [Polish] cities and towns displayed Red flags to welcome Soviet troops, helped to disarm Polish soldiers, and filled administrative positions in Soviet-occupied Poland. One report estimated that seventy-five per cent of all the top administrative posts in the cities of Lwow, Bialystok, and Luck were in Jewish hands during Soviet occupation ... The entire character of the University of Lwow changed during the Soviet occupation. Prior to the war, the percentage of students broke down as follows: Poles, 70 per cent; Ukrainians 15 per cent; Jews 15 per cent. After the Soviets, the percentage changed to 3 per cent, 12 per cent, and 85 per cent, respectively."" [Lukas, 128]

The evidence,"" observed Jewish commentator Aleksander Smolar, ""is overwhelming: large numbers of Jews welcomed the Soviet invasion, implanting in Polish memory the image of Jewish crowds greeting the invading Red Army as their liberator.""

""Whenever a [pro-Soviet] political march, or protest meeting, or some other sort of joyful event took place, the visual effect was always the same -- Jews."" [from the town of Lwow] [Piotrowski, 49]""

I would think there would eventually be some larger parallel organization, perhaps. A bit like today with the current CSDP battle groups consisting of battalions from multiple nations.

One might equally argue how German politicians are supposed to justify German money spent in the face of Russia's/China's/Saudi Arabia's refusal to participate in Burden Sharing?

After all, Germany (and the EU) are only a small part of the world, whether you measure that by population or by land area.

If Germany wants to help people by letting them live in Germany, fine. If they don't, also fine. It's their country.

I would point out that if the objective is to help refugees, it might be more efficient to help them financially when they are in other countries. But regardless, I am not German and it is none of my business what Germany does.

4236,"&gt;because we need one now?

You don't seem to want to grasp this. WE aren't getting an army.
The EU leadership is. That's not YOU, that's not your country. That THOSE FEW PEOPLE. And it's not in your benefit or mine, it's purely in THEIR benefit.

Secondly, making an EU army is not gonna magically get us more troops and tanks. Okay, do you get that? It's gonna get us LESS; Because now every country will have their own army, but is also going to be expected to pay for a EU army. Which means resources spread even thinner.

thirdly, we can PERFECTLY have an organized, semi-centralized alliance, where we practice together and strategize together with member states and still keep our sovereign authority and not hand it over to a hand full of EU officials. Here's the kicker: WE ALREADY DO THAT.
We ALREADY have been training together, doing Europe-wide military trainings and events. We simply do not need to EU for that.

&gt;European voters decide who gets to control the EU and then also the EU army.

Oh, God, you actually believe that.
We elect who sits in the European parliament. We don't elect the actual EU leadership. We don't have a say in EU policies, and for that matter, the EU parliament also only has a limited say in it.

&gt;Yes it is a big difference. But we don't really have an option. You seems to think like if you can point out problems with an EU army, this will mean that Russia will just disappear. 

you actually bought into the anti-Russia propaganda.
 Look, it's very simply. Russia is NOT going to attack us, and if they are, they won't invade us and an army is not going to stop them.

Here's my reasoning: Even if Russia wanted to invade us, they aren't able to. Why not? Their army is laughable, and they don't have the means to sustain a prolonged war with Europe. Why not? They simply do not have the resources. Why not? We can get our oil and gas from elsewhere. Russia would collapse within weeks after we stop paying for their gas. They simply can not possibly invade us. Get that idea out of your head because it was put there by the same EU officials who just want an army to play with and you swallow it like sweet cake.

Next thing: If Russia was to punish the EU, it would simply nuke us. That's all they have to do, and all we can do against that is an extensive missile protection system. Not soldiers and tanks. 

&gt;because our countries are too small individually.

Bro, just... use your brain.
If all European countries together aren't 'gonna cut it' then an army of all European armies together is also not gonna cut it.

You're not gonna make more soldiers, do you not get that? All that is going to happen is that the EU leadership wants control over (a part of) our armies. These armies are not going to become bigger, they will be split up.

Oh shit, well that was a brain fart on my part. Yeah, sorry about that.

&gt;For relations between hungarians and croats, maybe best insight was given by Nada Klaić in her epic work ""Povijest Hrvata"". After your read it, you will see that for ruling classes much more important was relations amng them, oridnary people was just poor peasants or slaves, tied to the land they work, no matter who was master at the time.

TBF it was like that for the peasants in most of Europe. Yeah, the Croatian nobility was pretty close with the Hungarian one, but still, Croatia, and with it the Croatian people, lost their independence just like we did. 

&gt;For end, hard times are in front of us all native white europeans, cahtolics and orthodox alike. Or we will stand united or divided we will fall. At least we on balkans knows well what islam brings.

Meh. I'm not really religious myself. And if I had to look from a Serb perspective, yeah, Islam brought us so much pain and suffering it's hard to quantify. But at the same time, the Catholic church brought its fair share of misery too. Keep in mind they supported the genocide against in the NDH. They heavily backed Croatia's independence in the 90s (can't blame them for that but it did hurt us). Hell, even in medieval times we were far from rosy with it. They weren't too keen on the idea of Dušan dominating the Balkans for example. Not as bad as Islam, but I wouldn't proclaim it a friend either.

But, I do fully agree that in Bosnia we Serbs and Croats do have to stick together not. Not out of some love course, but necesity, since the Muslims outnumber and aren't too fond of us. Especially the more hardcore Muslims...

&gt;Eh, one more thing, serbo-croatian :) well , linguistically we all know that our language is one (zato se i razumijemo bez problema), simply we call it croatian and you call it serbian. I have ho problem with that fact.

Well, we call it that and that purely cause of politics though. Which is why I prefer to avoid that. They used to be separate languages before but ever since the Vienna agreement they've gotten closer and closer and eventually became one. Though from what I've heard and read there is a push over in Croatia to try and distance it from Serbian. Mainly introducing some new words into the official language. Would you say that's happening?

People *still* believe that. They’re *proud* of their ancestors. So it’s not just Italy.

4353,"&gt;The only known cases of mass buying of paracetamol-type-medication in the Czech republic are these where this medication also contained pseudoefedrin, which can be used for homemade production of amphetamins and that was the thing that was happening.

True, but I sincerely doubt that a single mother is making homemade amphetamines in the back of her home.

You realise though that this would require quite a lot of pseudoefedrin though right ? 

And more importantly it's never mentioned in this article, only paracetamol is and not all drugs that include paracetamol include pseudoefedrin too. And the ones that do, they do so in minor amounts like 1-30 mgs per tablet/capsule. So you'd really need a lot of them.

4365,"&gt;Yes. I don't know why so many green parties hate nuclear power so much.

Because it puts all the risks on others in a different time and different place, and the risks take a very long time to be dealt with.

We have had nuclear power providing 4% of the world energy and 15% of the world electricity during 60 years. We have 3 major incidents producing exclusion zones, so one every 20 years for that percentage. So assuming we double that number, that's one exclusion zone around a random power plant in the world every decade. Simply not acceptable. And then we're not even dealing with nuclear waste popping up in unexpected places.

And besides, renewables are faster to deploy and faster to improve. Nuclear is an antiquated technology and there will not be any breakthroughs before a major country reaches 100% renewable coverage of their consumption. And then it's going to take a decade to build that new plant, and by that time it will be antiquated again.",Limburg,/r/europe/comments/bovp4b/polish_academics_write_open_letter_to_germany/enm65g0/,silverionmox,1557927660

It's interesting how many people in this thread are rock-solid convinced of this and yet haven't sent an email with all the evidence to the Italian prosecutors who've tried and failed to get NGOs charged for this.

We could almost conclude that it's bullshit based on nothing else than the desire to slander NGOs as the bogeyman of anti-immigration activists.

&gt; An example of this is that if they say they're from a country that isn't safe, then it doesn't matter if their asylum is accepted or not, because the EU country isn't allowed to return them, so they get to stay in the EU.

Some decisions government makes here are very mysterious, I often find myself thinking whether they have a mentality of a feudal lords. Perhaps it's a money laundering scheme, maybe something else but it still contradicts with people's interests. 

The first protest on 13th of May wasn't really organised by anyone as it was announced in the morning of the day. But if you were to find initiators, those would most likely be Parks and Sqares of Yekaterinburg, a local organisation of eco-activists that has organised protests in support of the square before, and Navalny's HQ, that has been involved in many protests last couple of years as their organiser. Media, large and small, helped spread the information about upcoming protest. 

If you are to visit the square, you will be able to easily see 1-2 churches just by standing there, and those ones aren't all it has nearby. There already is a large number of churches and not only they want to build more, but also sacrifice a public green space for it.
The other factor that make people very opposed to its construction is total disrespect that government expresses by disregarding people's will: prior to starting a construction they advertised and payed people to come and pray in support of the church, made a poll on city's website that no one heard of except some workers who were forced to vote in favour of construction. And overall attempted to make it seem like sqare supporters are a minority, even though it's very debatable.
Of course there are more reasons for people to be pissed off, some might not even care about the sqare but come to the protest because they are tired of decades of criminals ruling the country and this city, allowing them to do whatever they want will allow the same to happen in the futute. Some are very anti-religious. Many have a lot of memories assosiated with the park.

Generally, it seems, most of the people think that city needs more green spaces and no more churches, not the other way around. And of course, different people will have different reasons for their view.",,/r/europe/comments/booxm7/second_day_of_protests_in_ekaterinburg/enkp677/,Kriimuq,1557899836

4801,"&gt; No when the government was constantly in deadlock because of the veto Makarios wrote to kucuk to propose some changes

We can also argue, when Denktas agreed with every demand of Makarios but the Nicosia Turkish Municipality, he got nothing but the violence and isolation went on. Same goes for when Turkish Cypriot MPs agreed to the change in 1963, but then facing even more demands of Greek Cypriots MPs to be accepted or they continue to remain out of the parlaiment.

&gt; No the attacks were not from the state, but from nationalistic retards, which also attacked GCs that opposed them.

It was from both. If you mean EOKA-B, sure. But the terror campaign in 1963 was organised by the govt as well. Akritas Plan was a real thing, even though it's not certain how much the Archbishop was committed into it. Plan also included to persuade the international community that Turkish Cypriots have been given too many rights, weakening the Turkish Cypriots and as the final aim, a Greek annexation. Any blocking attempts to these by Turkish Cypriots were to be violently subjugated.

&gt; That is why I ended up agreeing with Denktas. This veto thing has been tried and failed. Unfortunately a two state solution is the option that can work in my opinion

One state solution can work, and Denktas was actually for a confederation rather than a two state solution. It's just Greek Cypriots have to get over with the Greek Cypriot domination, or Greek annexation. It seems like most have got over with it, but weirdly against the checks and balances, and against the veto rights that is there for not allowing a 1963 scenario or a Greek annexation.

&gt; Ok this sentence confused me, I don't know what you mean. 
A percentage of GCs would be allowed to vote in north and vice versa. There were vague references about removing this quota in the future..

I agree that the plan was bad in that regard. Although, it seems like Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots are finding a middle ground with allowing more but putting the ones exceeding the quota to vote regarding the ethnic lines. There were also such vague references in the plan.

&gt;So basically you have to make up ridiculous situations about what ""the left"" - which has not been in charge in any major European country on their own for a while now - would do to justify stopping things like sharing videos of beheadings, terrorist content and hate speech. Not a very strong case.

I don't consider them ""ridiculous"" after studying history (prohibiting ""expressions of intolerance"" is literally a Soviet communist concept [https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/02/28/the-u-n-hates-hate-speech-more-than-it-loves-free-speech/](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/02/28/the-u-n-hates-hate-speech-more-than-it-loves-free-speech/)) and seeing the New Zealand government act recently and imprison a teen for 14 years for sharing the shooting video. Distasteful? Maybe. Warranting jail? No.

Again, you say ""It could never happen here"", until someday it does happen.

&gt;Investigate does not mean prosecute or convict.

Excuse me, I don't think people should be visited by the police in their home for saying they don't like immigrants.

&gt;Also, you might want to check what a thought is. If you say it or put it into text, it is no longer a thought, so not a thought crime.

Semantics. Don't play dumb, you know what I'm talking about. Saying anything deemed ""intolerant"" should not get you any problems with the police.

&gt;calling for violence.

The US is *extremely* specific about what 'calling for violence' is - for example, saying ""I hope all muslims die"", ""Pakis are rapists"" and ""black people are uncivilized animals"" does not qualify as calling for violence there. In the UK however this gets you a police visit and possibly a fine.

&gt;Which is what would be blocked under hate speech laws.

As long as people are getting knocks on their door for opening their mouths about certain topics (something you seem fine with, I hope you never dare express a controversial opinion yourself) - European countries are severely lacking in free speech. I do not think bigots should be jailed. And again, ""hate speech"" is not even a thing that exists - the US Supreme Court already said that.

This is not something up for debate by the way, Newsweek already admitted that if the weren't for that pesky First Amendment, right-wingers could be jailed simply for having certain opinions.

4818,"&gt; ? Yes you are right the TC as a community did not. TMT did cooperate with Brits against EOKA, and the brits employed a TC policing force. Classic divide and conquer

TMT did not cooperate with Brits. They however, fought against EOKA. Sure Brits enjoyed EOKA and TMT fighting with each other, but that doesn't mean TMT cooperating with the British. I agree with the divide and conquer part, but EOKA arguing for a Greek annexation rather than the independence made it pretty easy since no Turkish Cypriot was for it, whether if they were communists or nationalists.

&gt; Your annexation was liberation for us. At that point in history Greece had respected the muslims in Thrace (although the situation was not and still is not perfect). The Greeks in Instabul on the other hand... So yeah we can bring random points in history if you like.

It's not random though. Crete syndrom was a thing in Cyprus. It's seen as liberation in Greece for sure, but it meant a nearly total ethnic cleansing for Muslim Cretans. I'm aware that intercommunal violence in Crete was on another level, and from both sides, etc. but the result was what made Turkish Cypriots fear of, meaning getting cleansed from the island. Sure, they weren't for a similar annexation in Cyprus at all.

&gt; Actually they did. Hard as it is to believe initially Turkey did not have much interest in Cyprus. They received a lot of pressure from UK to ""get interested"" and ""protect"" the rights of TCs. When I say that they were the architects of this mess, I mean it. If you trace the problem in its roots it all started with them.

It started with the UK, but the ethnic identities became a thing since the nationalism arriving from Turkey and Greece. Before all those, one was Muslim Cypriot community and the other was the Roman Orthodox one.

When an overlap occurs, it is up to the states to delineate the actual maritime boundary.

&gt; Akritas was founded as defensive mechanism (it was not named Akritas nor we know exactly when this name was adopted)
against TCs that were transferring weapons from Turkey. The members went to Makarios that he initially refused because he did not want paramilitary groups, but eventually agreed.

Akritas Plan was not a defensive plan but a plan that included voilent subjugation of Turkish Cypriots if they happen to block the plan, and it was simply for weakening Turkish Cypriots and taking over the island, and simply making Greece to annex it.

Turkish Cypriots bringing weapons from Turkey wasn't also a thing between 1960-63 either, and that's why they had to went for the arms they have smuggled during the '50s.

4889,"&gt; Yes indeed. It would be nice if Denktas was not in a double game, transferring weapons from Turkey and training and army of his own. 

TMT was already trained in '50s. Weapons were also smuggled before 1960, and after 1963 since the intercommunal violence, where Greek Cypriots could use guns owned by the state while Turkish Cypriots had to smuggle their own. 

&gt; Noone believed in RoC and both parties continued fighting for what they wanted originally.

Pretty much yes, at least for the leaderships.

&gt; No, Stella Soulioti, the justice minister of that time argued in her book that Makarios did not know anything. 

It's debatable but sure Makarios wasn't for Enosis after some point meaning he wasn't committed to the plan even if he knew about it or not.

&gt; Denktas was for two-state solution. Where did you read that he was for confederation.

It's his own words. Confederation is also some kind of two state solution. The agreements between him and Makarios talking about federation was also about Denktas and his advisor Soysal talking and using the word federation but referring to a confederation.

&gt; Greek annexation/domination is what exactly?

Greek annexation is the Greece taking over the island aka annexing it. 

Domination is arranging the constituon, or the parlaiment for them always passing laws or having representatives by themselves in the practice.

5035,"What are you talking about? The whole purpose of the experiment was because there was a debate if the reactor design is faulty or not. The supposed defect that was found is that the auxiliary generators take several minutes  to power up in case of an incident.

The reactor designers argued that the power generated by the turbine even in case of the reactor stop would be sufficient to power up the cooling system until the auxiliary generators turn on.

For the experiment it was instructed to turn off the safety system, which might sound risky, however if the instructions were followed to the letter nothing would have happened and it would be established if the remaining kinetic energy in the turbine was sufficient to power the cooling system.

What happened on that tragic day, is that there was a call from Kiev which forbade proceeding with the experiment (when it already started in the morning), because they needed the power (the experiment implied a full stop for the reactor). However the reactor was already slowed down and worked in this mode until late night when they gave the green light to proceed to completely another team which worked during the night shift and didn't study well the instructions.

So there were already two red flags: different conditions from the set in the instructions (obviously insufficient remaining power in the turbine after the reactor worked in slowed mode all day) and completely unprepared team.

In case of India specifically I know that there's been a massive influx of Saudi financed madrasas in recent years and I suspect it might be the same for Pakistan. 

Pakistan is basically a failed state right now and many of the educated people and those who can afford it have left for other countries. This leaves more people easily radicalized. But it's not because of culture or anything. In Iran you have the radicals in power - Iran is not a liberal country as it is today. Same goes for some places in North Africa. Egypt is not a liberal country. It's one of the worst places to be a woman. Tunisia might be a bit better but look at the crazies going wild in Libya now that Gaddafi is gone (not implying that he was better). I'm not sure what you mean by ""Arabs are a different bunch"".

Remember, the sooner the pound was untied from the mark and re-floated the less bad the damage would be.  The longer the UK waited, the worse the difference between it's real (demand-based) value and the tied value becomes.  It really was just really bad policy with inevitable results and the sooner it ended the better.

Short-sellers get a bad rap mostly due to misunderstanding the positive effect they ultimately have.

They help prevent and attenuate price bubbles.  They often expose famous cases of corporate law breaking because they have an incentive to both discover corporate crimes and to make them public.  Can they and do they often lie?  Of course, but not in Soro's case and you can't disregard how many companies lie to inflate the value of their stocks.  

The most important role they play is that they help prevent wealth from being destroyed.  If the value of Apple stock falls by 50% in a world with no short sellers, that value is simply gone – erased.  When you allow people to bet on the value going down through short selling or put options, that loss turns into a transfer of wealth rather than it totally disappearing.

&gt;Chi-Square Analysis of Victim Age and Gender Crossover (N==311)

Look for this for the exact page

As this research clearly shows, it is only in the children that are 0-6 years of age do people abuse both genders equally.

0-6 is not altar boys age. And is not the age of boys clergy prefers or abuses (vast majority of victims are of older age in church)

Now look at the 6-13 age, and we can see that the vast majority (82%) only abuses one gender.

out of 13-17 also vast majority (83%) only abuses one gender.

So yes. These priests are largely gay (82%) vs bi (18%) if they abuse boys of age 6-17 (which is the age of altar boys and vast majority of victims of church scandals)

So despite not identifying as gay they are. Same as they are pedophiles despite not identifying as pedophiles.

But go on, please, try and try and try to convince yourself that people that sleep with their own gender aren't gay. Live in your delusions all you want, I'm guessing the reason you want to believe that is because you're attracted to your own gender and live in delusion that you're not gay.",Yugoslav,/r/europe/comments/bog5is/public_tv_in_poland_right_now/enirxwn/,ahwhatever11,1557869726

People want to go from northern Africa to Europe, so they pay to get on board a ship that's supposed to take them there illegally.

The countries that want to take the refugees should be allowed to do so, that the ones that don't want to should also be allowed to do that, Then both groups of countries get to express their values.

&gt; That is not cooperation, that's holding the rest of Europe hostage.

No it isn't, Italy isn't telling other European countries what to do.

&gt; Problems that affect everyone also need to be tackled by everyone working together

Italy has chosen to tackle the problem by not letting people in. 

&gt; not with individual countries just ""opting out"" of previously agreed upon responsibilities because they feel like it.

I daresay the current Italian government would say they hadn't agreed to it.

The EU should be about some countries telling other countries what to do, on immigration or anything else. It simply won't work that way. If the EU tried to make all its member states accept refugees, many of them would just leave, and if you have multiple states leaving that would be the effective end of the EU and we'd all be worse off.

&gt; Since totalitarian movements exist in a world which itself is nontotalitarian, they are forced to resort to what we commonly regard as propaganda. But such propaganda always makes its appeal to an external sphere — be it the nontotalitarian strata of the population at home or the nontotalitarian countries abroad. This external sphere to which totalitarian propaganda makes its appeal may vary greatly; even after the seizure of power totalitarian propaganda may address itself to those segments of its own population whose co-ordination was not followed by sufficient indoctrination. In this respect Hitler’s speeches to his generals during the war are veritable models of propaganda, characterized mainly by the monstrous lies with which the Fuehrer entertained his guests in an attempt to win them over. [1] The external sphere can also be represented by groups of sympathizers who are not yet ready to accept the true aims of the movement; finally, it often happens that even party members are regarded by the Fuehrer’s inner circle or the members of the elite formations as belonging to such an external sphere, and in this case they, too, are still in need of propaganda because they cannot yet be reliably dominated. In order not to overestimate the importance of the propaganda lies one should recall the much more numerous instances in which Hitler was completely sincere and brutally unequivocal in the definition of the movement’s true aims, but they were simply not acknowledged by a public unprepared for such consistency [2].

&gt; [1] See *Hitlers Tischgespräche*. In the summer of 1942, he still talks about ""[kicking] even the last Jew out of Europe and resettling the Jews in Siberia or Africa or Madagascar, while in reality he had already decided on the ""final solution"" prior to the Russian invasion, probably in 1940, and ordered the gas ovens to be set up in the fall of 1941. Himmler already knew in the spring of 1941 that ""the Jews [must be] exterminated to the last man by the end of the war. This is the unequivocal desire and command of the Fuehrer"". 

&gt; [2] In this connection there is a very interesting report, dated July 16, 1940, on a discussion at the Fuehrer’s headquarters, in the presence of Rosenberg, Lammers and Keitel, which Hitler began by stating the following ""basic principles"": ""It was now essential not to parade our ultimate goal before the entire world; . . . Hence it must not be obvious that [the decrees for maintaining peace and order in the occupied territories] point to a final settlement. All necessary measures — executions, resettlements — can, and will be, carried out in spite of this."" This is followed by a discussion which makes no reference whatever to Hitler’s words and in which Hitler no longer participates. He quite obviously had not been ""understood"".

https://archive.org/details/Totalitarianism/page/n379

&gt; Nazi propaganda concentrated all these new and promising vistas in one concept which it labeled Volksgemeinschaft. This new community, tentatively realized in the Nazi movement in the pretotalitarian atmosphere, was based on the absolute equality of all Germans, an equality not of rights but of nature, and their absolute difference from all other people. [1] After the Nazis came to power, this concept gradually lost its importance and gave way to a general contempt for the German people (which the Nazis had always harbored but could not very well show publicly before) on one hand, [2] and a great eagerness, on the other, to enlarge their own ranks from ""Aryans"" of other nations, an idea which had played only a small role in the prepower stage of Nazi propaganda. The Volksgemeinschaft was merely the propagandists preparation for an ""Aryan"" racial society which in the end would have doomed all peoples, including the Germans. 

&gt; [1] Hitlers’s early promise, ""I shall never recognize that other nations have the same right as the German,"" became official doctrine: ""The foundation of the national socialist outlook in life is the perception of the unlikeness of men""

&gt; [2] For instance, Hitler in 1923: ""The German people consists for one third of heroes, for another third, of cowards, while the rest are traitors"". After the seizure of power this trend became more brutally outspoken. See, for instance, Goebbels in 1934: ""Who are the people to criticize? Party members? No. The rest of the German people? They should consider themselves lucky to be still alive. It would be too much of a good thing altogether, if those who live at our mercy should be allowed to criticize."" During the war Hitler declared: ""I am nothing but a magnet constantly moving across the German nation and extracting the steel from this people. And I have often stated that the time will come when all worth-while men in Germany are going to be in my camp. And those who will not be in my camp are worthless anyway."" Even then it was clear to Hitler’s immediate environment what would happen to those who ""are worthless anyway"". Himmler meant the same when he said: ""The Führer does not think in German, but in Germanic terms"", except that we know from *Hitlers Tischgespräche* that in those days he was already making fun even of the Germanic ""clamor"" and thought in ""Aryan terms.""",Germany,/r/europe/comments/bojwrs/the_sweden_democrats_latest_ad_its_not_the_first/enitfck/,neinMC,1557870274

Because, for example, if a priest is targeting only boys who are around him, it obviously means he will target only boys.

Also, if some gay is caught as hostage, people on the internet should kindly refrain from publicly unveiling the homosexuality of the hostage, as it would lead to extra cruelty and probable burning of the victim.

And before you say something like yes it can, I just went and checked Serbian quarterly growth around the time of the flood.  

[source](https://tradingeconomics.com/serbia/gdp-growth)   

So we have -0.8% in 2013's last quarter, -1.4% in Q1 2014, -0.3% in Q2 2014 (when flood happens), -1.4% in Q3 2014,  0.8% in Q4 2014 and then more positives. Clearly Serbia's economy was in trouble even before the flood and ultimately the losses of that year are not very significant.   

&gt;Bulgaria is a cautionary tale in the sense that even with EU membership, progress is not guaranteed   

Am I speaking to a wall? Bulgaria literally has had some of the highest GDP and salary growth in the union. Sure it started from a very low base, but it's still growth and progress means growth, not current state.

5349,"That's not how this works.

The predators rarely limit themselves to some sort of sexual preference. In most cases, they look for the victims that are easiest to find, groom and isolate. Among Catholics in Poland, these cases are mostly related to ministrants (altar servants) and studying clergy (ephebophilia cases) - which are traditionally dominated by males, though it's not really a strict rule. 

Basically, boys have way more opportunities to spend time with priests, and that's why they are the more common victim of the predators.

My point was that if there had been such ""analysts"" advising western states before Russia intervened in Ukraine, I don't think their response would have been so divided and incoherent as it was in 2014. Thus I doubt western states and their ""analysts""anticipated Russian actions.

First one concludes like this

*""The reality is that, after two decades of eastward Nato expansion, this crisis was triggered by the west's attempt to pull Ukraine decisively into its orbit and defence structure, via an explicitly anti-Moscow EU association agreement.""*

Which I think is complexity wrong. There is no EU or NATO member state that has been forcefully absorbed against its will. Any state has the final say in these matters and saying that EU forcefully pulled Ukraine in its orbit is very far fetched. At the same time we can look at how Russia forced Yanukovich not to ratify the EU association agreement, which in my opinion is direct meddling.

The second article seems to build upon the leaked phone calls between those USA officials.

5428,"&gt; * The [Ethnic groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_groups) in Cyprus are Greek 77%, Turkish 18%, other 5% of the population.

In 1960, yes.

&gt; The Annan plan equates the representation of the two major ethnic groups in the proposed [Senate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate)and in the [Supreme Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_court) giving 50-50 representation to the two communities.

In the Supreme Court, yes.

In parlaiments, it was the same quota as it was in 1960, meaning 25%.

1960 also favoured Turkish Cypriots in certain places, like the fire brigades and police, since they saw their positon as fragile and could been attacked. Turned out that they were right.

Anyway, I think we both know quotas Suprême Court doesn't make 25% representation suddenly 50%.

&gt; * The Plan did not include a settlement regarding the repatriation of [Turkish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey) settlers living on Greek Cypriot owned land in [Northern Cyprus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Cyprus), while after 19 years, the possibility of abolishing the derogation of 5% of [Greeks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeks) and Turkish citizens who could settle in Cyprus, is obvious, and the danger of a permanent mass settling of Cyprus by Turkey is visible.

I don't even defend the agreement but saying you're making up things for making it seem worse.

Mass settling of Cyprus by Greece is also possible by the same logic. There was the possibility of abolishing such by the will of both communities anyway.

&gt; * Many [Greek Cypriots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_Cypriots) interpreted the Right of Return policy as seriously flawed, meaning only 20% of Greek Cypriot refugees would be able to return over a time frame of 25 years, whereas [Turkish Cypriots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_Cypriots) would have had full right of return. The plan denied to all Cypriots rights enjoyed by all other [EU citizens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_of_the_European_Union) (right of free movement and residence, the right to apply to work in any position (including national [civil services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_service), the [right to vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_vote)).[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_Cypriot_Annan_Plan_referendums#cite_note-Annan_Plan_page_13-12)

&gt; * Following Annan 5 plan the [Greek Cypriots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_Cypriots) would not have been allowed to make up more than 6% of the population in any single village in the Turkish controlled areas in the north

Again, I have not argued about those. You're not responding me but pointing out other stuff.

If you're for arguing this, it was about conservation of the bizonality. It's there since Greek Cypriots forced Turkish Cypriots into ghettos and isolated them meaning cutting them of from the outside, including not letting them out for working or not letting their products out. That's why people are having traumas about being a practical minority again, and same goes for them not having a zone where they consist a majority. Again, that's not something I've pointed out though.

&gt; thus they would have been prevented from setting up their own schools for their children and would not have even been able to give birth once this quota was reached.

5513,"&gt; They enjoy the same rights in Slovakia. Slovakia is bound to recognize any marriage certificate issued in any other EU country, including those of gay couples, so any gay married people living there can enjoy the same rights as any other married couple.

And what about single gay people or otherwise unmarried gay people? Will Slovakian society recognise a married gay people as positively as London or Amsterdam?

&gt; But also, you are basically inflating one issue, which granted may seem major for the LGBT people, but given that LGBT people really do not form the majority of the employees of EMA (or other agency), it is overall really not such a major issue.

This would potentially be worth talking about if Slovakia had anything socially over somewhere like The Netherlands, but it doesn't. Even if there are only a few LGBT people, or a few straight people who care about stuff like this, this still makes it a worse destination with little to make up for it.

&gt; Either way, what the employees want or do not want did not play such an important role, the decision ultimately was a political decision made by the national governments. And in this kind of set-up, countries like Slovakia will always have it harder to excercise influence compared to countries like the Netherlands of France.

I'm talking about your complaints about how employees responded when asked where they would like to move. 

&gt; Also, your entire tone is patronizing as fuck.

No it's not, it's just honest. Your very post is extremely indicative of the kind of attitude that EMA employees wanted to avoid. ""There are only a few of you, so suck it up"". ""Recognition of foreign marriages is the same thing as being allowed to marry"". ""Why would straight people at the agency care about how the LGBT ones felt?"". The casual disrespect of people's desire for rights, acceptance and comfort is completely foreign to westerners in 2019 and is exactly why they didn't want to leave the west. Would you rather live in a country that cared about your happiness, or one that told you to get over yourself for wanting to be happy?

&gt; And if some Western Europeans don't like that? Well who says that they have to work at all those agencies?

The EMA is an extraordinarily important agency that needed to reduce downtime upon moving as much as physically possible. Asking that agency to waste time recruiting new staff when they could just retain their old staff is ludicrous when there is absolutely no gain in exchange.

Again, if your attitude is that your countries shouldn't change to suit westerners, that's fine. If you don't think your countries should be welcoming to people who like an open and accepting society, or minorities who want equal (truly equal) rights, that's fine. Just don't complain when people would rather live in societies that are nicer to them.",NOT in favour of tax havens,/r/europe/comments/bog0uj/which_city_should_host_the_new_eu_agency/engteca/,TropoMJ,1557841047

*My* old hometown stopped being a place I'd have considered safe for walking around at any time more than ten years ago -- not because of any migrants, but because of a breakdown in public order involving young men who were unable to find a job, or teenagers who just got bored and formed gangs.

We live in an age where 14 year old schoolgirls are wondering if they'll have to offer anal sex, due to hardcore pornography being shared on the schoolyard, or where schoolkids bully other children into suicide or even torture them to death.

5536,"&gt; I'm not referencing 'useless eaters'. Only you are clutching your pearls, wagging your finger and making the link to Nazi terminology. It's not hard to realise that there are useful, desirable migrants and those that are less so. The majority of homeless people in London are immigrants for crying out loud.

What you just did there was restate the point. You just said ""I'm not referencing useless eaters, but these are **undesirable immigrants**."" It's a bit like saying ""I'm not saying I'm on fire, but hand me the fire extinguisher and get me some burn salve."" What you've done is restated the point in slightly vaguer language.

&gt; No people other than the British people should have an automatic right to live and settle in the UK. EU citizens should not have the same right to live in this country as me when my ancestors helped make this country what it is over countless generations.

Right, so you're for giving Commonwealth countries the automatic right of settlement for helping to build the country? And also all the traditions and ideas we've taken from countries all around the world should also qualify a fair few people for automatic settlement.

But if we're being selective, you'd have to prove that your family actually did help to make the country over countless generations. And that means if someone didn't they'd be kicked out. But are we going to set up a bureau to investigate everybody's family trees?

I make a point about benefit fraudsters further up, and it stands here as well: it's cheaper and more socially healthy to just let people stay.

And what you mean by ""made it what it is"" is interesting, because that doesn't necessarily mean good. Congratulations, you've managed to find a system which includes BNP members and excludes immigrants.

Actually, that's an interesting point: what is it that your family tree did that was positive? If they contributed to the Imperial Service, they were contributing to a dictatorial, monarchical, kleptomaniacal system that robbed people globally of their wealth.

If you're so willing to praise yourself for what your ancestors did, do you stand trial for that one great grandfather who went into some colony or another and raped someone? You are not your parents. You do not get to guarantee yourself a pass on settlement rights based on your parents, who, I'm sorry but for all I know, they could be murderers.

It's essentially a type of bigotry. Someone can't help how they were born, and here you are, judging them for it (and oddly enough, in your own case praising yourself for it), and reducing their rights on that basis.

&gt; Migrants come to the UK to improve their own lives and to take new opportunities for themselves, not for altruistic reasons. They should be grateful for the opportunity. Immigration to Britain should primarily serve the British people and not the immigrant who can and should leave if they feel they can do better elsewhere.

""They should be grateful of the scraps we feed them, while we exploit them for our own ends.""

Don't know if you noticed, but you're viewing immigrants like tools again.

From where I'm standing, if we're doing things to help the British people, we should really be instituting socialist policies, like the NHS. I'll not even bother with talking about immigrants because you're always going to say ""yeah but the bad ones,"" so all I'll say is this: it would cost more in both money and lost 'good immigrants' if we screened immigrants for their ability to help Britain than if we didn't.

5562,"&gt;Are you genuinely stupid? We're talking about people who have committed crimes, not people who may commit them.

Yes, and? Your justification is that it serves to prevent crimes. Are you still thinking with the horribly outdated ""once a criminal, always a criminal"" mindset?

&gt;Rehabilitation doesn't work for those who don't want to be rehabilitated.

We'll find out if we try. You give them up by default.

&gt;Ah, so there's no difference between murder and theft? You want the judiciary to treat them the same?

You talked about a difference between the people who commit them. There isn't for most. Under the right (wrong) pressure, everyone could rape or murder.

&gt;Actually, if a person kills someone because of a recognised medical condition it's manslaughter, and usually mentally ill people don't get life sentences. If anything, they might be kept in a mental institution for a very long time. 

There's a difference between suffering from delusions and psychopathy for example. The former are considered ill, the latter are still held responsible.

&gt;That's all beside the point though. A person who willingly and purposefully kills another person in cold blood is callous and in no way is deserving of living in society with normal people, where that person may murder again. It's negligence to let a murderer roam free.

No. People can and do rehabilitate successfully. Released murderers are probably less dangerous as ex-murderer than as car drivers.

Decline in population is a huge problem for almost all [EU countries](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Fertility_statistics). And it's not very likely they can fuck their way out of it. Birth rates are low in [developed](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Income_and_fertility) countries. People who prosper just don't wanna have a lot of kids. You can give it a little bump by imposing all kinds of (taxation) measures, but it won't help much. And you will definitely not get to the point of 2.1 (replacement rate). That's just [not](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN?locations=EU) gonna happen. And you need to get above that rate in order to make up for lost time.

It's naive to think that will ever happen.

So you will need to find other ways to prevent a decline in population, *if* that's what you want. The only other option is to simply accept a (strong) decline in population and find ways to deal with that.

Those are basically the only three options you have; fuck like rabbits on steroids (not gonna happen), get more immigrants (not gonna happen in a lot of countries), or just simply accept a (strong) decline in population.

For a lot of countries, the last option seems to be the only one these days.

I thought we were talking about 'immigrants taking your jobs...', but if you would rather talk about 'your taxes being wasted on helping people you don't care about' then let's do that instead, because that's even more laughable.

Here is a very simplified [2016 UK budget](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_Kingdom_budget). As you can see the vast majority of government spending is helping the working class as you call it. At the same time most of the taxes don't even aply to you, and those that do (income tax, VAT, national insurance) are overwhelmingly paid by the top%-earners in society (not argueing against it, that's exactly how it needs to be in a functioning society). 

Here is a breakdown of the [contributions to those tax revenues](https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/9178) for you, check **figure 5**. If you consider the 'working class' to be the 30% adult population with the lowest income then they contribute ~10% of the overall tax revenue and less than 5% of income tax revenue, while the top 10% earners contribute ~40%, the top half earners ~80% of the overall tax revenue.

So when you say 'why should the working class be taxed to help some foreigners' first of all why should the rich be taxed to help the working class (again, i'm not the one argueing against that). Secondly, what meaningful tax contribution are we talking about? Out of a 700bn£ budget the net contributions to the EU were 7bn£ or 1%, of which the working class (30% lowest earners in UK) paid 10%. That's like 3,50 per person....

Now compare that to the benefits the UK has from being part of the   common market. You had a [trade volume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_largest_trading_partners_of_United_Kingdom) of over 350bn£ with the EU in 2015.

Under capitalism, there is a race to the bottom.

Under capitalism, workers are encouraged to fight over scraps, instead of recognising who takes the whole pie.

Maybe it's time we recognise that capitalism causes problems.

The state institutes a minimum wage to halt the race to the bottom. Pretty socialist, the state stepping in to help the workers.

Unions organise to give workers the power to demand a slice of the pie, and co-operatives and communes allow the workers to keep the whole pie. Unions have always been a big socialist organisation (they are called organised labour, after all).

Unfortunately.

The only time they got in Czech parliament was during the era they were centrist on other issues, so appealing to both leftist/rightist and conservative/progressive voters. And they even got into the government as part of a bit rightist/conservative coalition. Since they shift to leftism and progressiveness (and lost rightist and conservative voters), they have no chance.

It's similar in European election. [Their manifesto](https://europeangreens.eu/priorities-2019-what-european-greens-fight) is not a single-issue type (""We are going to fight climate change and willing to make a coalition with anyone who will fight it with us""). On the contrary, reading things like ""We will work to push back against and isolate those who try to convert valid criticism of deficiencies and mistakes into an anti-European, extremist and xenophobic roll-back."" makes it clear they are more afraid of certain parties than of climate change.

5944,"&gt;Is this the best analogy for the relation between two G7 partners?

Sure, why not?  Germany takes, takes, takes and does not give.  Then when confronted with evidence of its behavior it lashes out in anger.  

Ever seen pure rage?  It is the spoiled child who has grown into a spoiled adult, whose parents say ""we're cutting you off"".  Germany has had American subsidies for so long that they've become expected.  Now that the Americans want to redirect attention to themselves Germany is acting out.  

&gt;The only effect of an act like this is expanding the rift between the two nations.

You're confusing cause and effect.  The **cause** is Germany's ungrateful freeloading.  The **reaction** was the gift of a handful of candy.  The rift has been caused by Germany's outright refusal to carry its fair share of the burden.  This far predates Trump.  

&gt;So now you're saying the alternative to insulting an ally was an act of war against it.

The insult was delivered by Germany, who has consistently and deliberately refused to do what's right.  Honestly I can't blame Germany - they've made a mint by acting like this and the party who changes course will be punished by voters.  So  they're bitterly clinging to the vision of the US alliance they had back in the 1950s, when Americans paid for everything and Germans took the profit.

5995,"&gt; High qualified people are working in jobs that require less qualifications than they have, jobs that people who are unemployed could take.

This here is why I hate when people refer to the ""unemployment queue"".

There's no cycling through of people, it's a first in, first out *stack* if anything. What I mean by that is the long term unemployed continue to remain unemployed in a bad jobs market, with the most employable (including the recently unemployed) ""taking the (too few) jobs"".

You then send up with a misallocation of resources, as you say, and a whole heap of people that become detached from the process, depressed, etc.

There's not much that can be done short of fixing the economy sadly, which is broadly outside the scope of any individual member within in the monetary union. It's why tighter integration, like the transfers suggested, are so paramount if it is to go on. Until your job market is improved to the point that those people are headhunted and rehired elsewhere, it's just such a sad state of affairs for those trying to start out in the market.",,/r/europe/comments/bo340c/european_elections_spain_seeks_to_become_the/enfeubp/,TheMania,1557814329
