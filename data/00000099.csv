97,"Yes. This would only be natural. It's really the same people, it's really hard to tell them apart if you're an outsider. Unlike with Austria and Germany, Moldova and Romania weren't separate empires for most of the time. Moldova to Romania is like East Germany is to West Germany. However, unfortunately, the situation in Moldova is quite dire. The society is heavily polarized, and it's a great place for corrupt leeches to install themselves. This polarization and the emotions it evokes takes precedent over any rational decisions to change something.

Also, reunification isn't really possible, now that Romania is part of the EU. Moldova is not EU material, not even close. More than 80% of people are hard homophobes for instance. The majority of the families experience domestic violence. Human rights transgressions are perpetrated by the entire spectrum of people, from leaders to people who end up the victims themselves.

If you want to understand ""the tragedy of the commons"", go to Moldova. Everything in it is the epitomy of mismanagement and opportunism, corruption and ignorance.

Moldova needs to change before it ""joins the club"". The EU can definitely help, but not by giving money. Moldova needs its people to know, to see, how people from the EU are helping, whether they're black, brown, homosexual, tattooed from head to toe. Moldova has a narrative going on there, that Europe is a cesspit of degenerates, that Moldovan poverty makes them resist this ""craze"". Show them who you are. Show them love, show them understanding and tolerance, show them what's it like to have rights, what it's like to stand your ground. This has to come not from men in suits, but from people like you.

101,"&gt; So why are Dutch against Eurobonds and which negative effects would have on the Netherlands?
&gt; 
&gt; 

We don't want to be liable for the debts they accumulate due to overspending, and do not trust them to handle their public finances sustainably. The negative effects are increased borrowing costs for ourselves, there being no more incentive for southern countries to limit their spending, and us being forced to cut our budgets to finance theirs forever without a way out.

&gt; Did you even check the links you provide? According to that link Dutch pension funds have approximately 100M euro in bonds of countries that would surely benefit from Eurobonds. 

You're looking at the figures for 2009q4 and have mistaken billions for millions. In 2016Q4 Dutch pension funds had 356 **billion** Euro in government bonds, 4% of which in Italian bonds (down from 18% in 2009) 15% in French (down from 25% in 2009)

116,"""The problem, when analysing the Italian and Dutch cases over the last 30 years, is that these stereotypes are not based on any precise study with figures.  On the contrary, if we subtract the massive interest that Italy has to pay each year on its debt - the so-called primary balance, i.e. the balance of income and expenditure excluding debt (health, education, infrastructure, etc.) - it appears much more thrifty than the Netherlands, at least since the early 1990s.  Since then, and with the exception of the financial crisis, Italy has always had a positive primary balance, whereas the Netherlands has much more often had a deficit balance.  The difference is that the Netherlands pays much lower interest rates on its debt.  In fact, Italy is still burdened by the debt that was built up almost 40 years ago by the Christian Democratic regime, which saw the ""clean hands"" operation of the early 1990s imploded.  It has even been too thrifty, at the cost of anaemic growth and decaying infrastructure.""

According to the Onet report, Piebiak operated and financed an online campaign by a woman called Emilia who allegedly sent over 2,000 letters and emails about Markiewicz to other judges as well as to pro-government right-wing media. The messages contained fabricated, semi-confirmed and gossipy details of the judge’s personal life. According to Onet, Emilia obtained Markiewicz’s personal address from Piebiak so she could send him one of the letters.

The foundation hasn't been willing to say much about its finances in Poland, but the online news portal Onet dug through financial statements made in Washington by a U.S. lobbying firm hired by the Polish organization. Onet reported that the White House Writers Group, a Washington PR firm, has been paid $5.5 million since 2017 to raise Poland's profile in the U.S. — a sum similar to the annual budget of the Polish Embassy in Washington. A YouTube site set up for the foundation had 13 subscribers as of Tuesday, with mostly fewer than 10 views per video. An Instagram account with stock images of Poland had 51 observers.

My conclusion is different, as I mentioned in another comment: The EU is too weak. Your neighbours could have done much better, but they won't improve by dismantling the EU; quite the opposite, the support you got was because the EU rallied them to improve after a bad start.

I read that China and Russia helped Italy more (although it appears that a lot of that help was more marketing than actual help, and the Chinese supplies in several countries were too low quality to be actually used).

418,"&gt; Funny, it is western Europe that's getting rich by attracting the best and brightest.

Just wanted to point out that France has definitely not been benefiting, nor did Italy. Spain has been a mixed bag, with a part great and a part painful. That's a lot of countries out from your ""western Europe"" already. Let's stop making arbitrary groups of countries that don't fit our narrative (west, north, east and south), and target countries by e.g. name instead when we know that what we're saying applies to them.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; It will take decades to normalize, but it will happen

If by this you mean that former communist countries will catch up, I agree. But there is something else that diverges, it's the EU's economic core compared to the rest. This will keep diverging because the EU has become geopolitically imbalanced as a result of the enlargement, and unfortunately precisely in favour of the economic core. The geopolitics lock the politics and the situation only twitches when the very existence of the Union is threatened.

I don't think it can be fixed without restructuring the EU, IMO into 2 or 3 groups of tightly knit countries that are loosely connected with one another. The alternative is a full blown European wide democracy based on the Swiss model, but that seems less likely, if only because it requires decision makers to relinquish power.",,/r/europe/comments/g2dqfx/on_this_day_in_2003_the_treaty_of_athens_was/fnnkkuw/,_Handsome_Jack,1587094567

&gt; ""There's no oxygen [for patients],"" the medic who shot the video said in a comment that accompanied it.

I haven't been following this closely, and only became aware of it when it showed up in a news article on /r/ukpolitics -- so maybe everyone else has been following it more-closely and is already familiar with this.  But it sounds like it might be the same thing in Russia that I heard about there.

Apparently, one issue that came up in both the UK and China at least was that while hospitals have an oxygen supply, the oxygen supply is (a) centralized and (b) flows through pipes that have a limited diameter.

453,"&gt;we will just continue to have 30,000 cases a day until there is herd immunity

The way I understand it, herd immunity is not binary. It's not like one day there is no herd immunity, and the next one there suddenly is. It's a gradual process.

When R0 is exactly 1, the number of new cases will progressively drop, for two reasons:

1. Because of partial heard immunity, the ""effective"" R0 is slightly below 1, and that already is enough to slow down number of new cases (a^(x) goes to 0 for a&lt;1).
2. The more people were sick, the stronger the heard immunity, dropping effective R0 even further, accelerating the slowdown.

If you initially have 1 in 1000 people sick, you might expect 11 cases after 10 ""generations"" of spreading. But according to my back-of-the-envelope calculation, you will have ""only"" 10.8 cases, with effective R0 dropping below 0.99 and 0.95 new cases per generation. That doesn't sound like much but by generation 50, instead of 51 cases there will be only 36.3, with effective R0 of 0.96 and just 0.34 new cases per generation. Total number of cases will end up around 44.4 (that's just 4.44% of population), at which point the number of new cases per generation will drop to \~0.

What's also worth noting, is that R0 is just an average. For various reasons some people are more likely to contract the virus than others. The former will get sick earlier, increasing the proportion of the latter in healthy population, and again decreasing the effective R0, even if we totally ignore heard immunity. Or look at it this way: the longer you stay healthy, the higher the chance that whatever you are doing to avoid getting sick is working, hence the lower the chance you will catch the virus if you continue doing that (and by ""doing"" I mean both things like social distancing and ""doing"" things you don't really control, like having good genes).

The previous chancellor, Helmut Kohl, raised Merkel as his successor in the CDU party. But it wasn't clear that she made it, the party doesn't have to follow nominations, they have elections. It would have been possible that Schäuble made it.

Then after Kohl came ... not Merkel, but Schröder, from the SPD party. This could have been the end of the Merkel carrier, sometimes the current party leader gets sacked when the opposition wins.

On top of this, in Germany the Chancellor isn't elected directly by the people, but by the parliament. When I was young, I though this to be a little bit less Democratic than a direct election. But fine did tell me that this is a precious attribute of our constitution.

I bet it will, easily, in at least some countries.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_median_age

The median age in Niger, the youngest country in the world, is 15.4 years.  Half the population in the country is younger than 15.4 years.

If you recall, there was some controversy over whether children even could *catch* covid-19, because their immune systems so easily controlled the disease that we weren't sure whether they didn't have the disease or whether they just weren't showing symptoms and could still spread it to others.

https://www.populationpyramid.net/niger/2019/

Niger's 80-84 age cohort is 0.1% of the population.

https://www.populationpyramid.net/italy/2019/

Italy's 80-84 age cohort is 1.6% of the population.

IIRC, the ratio of people who saw a critical condition, which is probably at least a rough proxy, maybe a bit over-estimated, for those who would live if life support is available, to the ones who died, is something like 2:1.

528," Keeping the distance is important 

Microbiologist Arthur Casadevallis of Johns Hopkins University and infectious biologist Liise-Anne Pirofski of Albert Einstein Medical College described the five factors that determine why Covid-19 infection affects patients so differently on the Bloomberg portal.

1.Dose of viruses
It depends first and foremost on the ""dose"" of the virus, ie how many infectious agents a person receives. If only a few, then his immune system copes easily. The person can then experience no symptoms or get sick easily. If a person receives a large amount of viruses, then they begin to multiply in a flash. The immune system is unable to overcome them, making it difficult for a coronavirus to get sick.

2. Genetics

The second factor is genetics, more precisely, the inherited cell configuration and protein production in the body. Typically, viruses catch themselves in the cell's host by attaching to proteins (called receptors) on the cell's surface. The number and nature of these proteins vary from person to person.
When the virus lacks the required receptors, then the person becomes resistant to the infection. An example might be H viruses, which cause AIDS. Some people's cells do not have the receptors that these HIV viruses can attach to.

3. Path of infection
Another important factor is the way in which viruses enter the body. Because inhaling droplets with viruses can cause a single reaction in the immune system, and infection from dirty surfaces, followed by touching the face with your hands, can cause a different reaction.

""The nasal mucosa and lungs respond with different defenses, so the path of infection can greatly determine the course of the disease,"" say researchers Casadevallis and Pirofski.

I guess my question is if social distancing is only able to get us down to an RO of 1, then does that mean that we will just continue to have 30,000 cases a day until there is herd immunity or there's a vaccine.

658,"&gt; Your premise was not to overwhelm ICUs. Hard hit places had overwhelmed ICUs. It would take two years in germany, the US, becasically every western nation, to keep the curve flat enough to not overwhelm ICUs and get to 60-70% infected.
 
They were overwhelmed because they were surprised by the virus and they didn't prepare. As soon as they got overwhelmed they locked down. It wouldn't have taken much longer to reach similar levels of immunit if they had managed to keep the spread just slightly lower.

The main factor contributing to ICU burden is the amount of elderly that gets infected. Pretty much the entire population below 40 could get this virus and it would barely be noticable at the hospitals, but as soon as it gets into an elderly home or similar, the burden goes up real quick. If you can protect the risk groups, the ICU capacity is there.

Stockholm has been fairly stable at 80% of their scaled up ICU capacity and they're reaching significant amounts of immunity. Enough that the swedish epidemiologists are starting to see the effects of immunity in their curves and calculations.

&gt; That should be logical. Think next time.

That's unnecessary. Insults doesn't contribute to a healthy discussion.

&gt;And vaccines every two years would be a problem why exactly? 

I'm not claiming it is. Not every sentence is an objection. Most young and healthy people will likely not care in a few years time though, especially if a second infection ends up being a lot milder because you still have parital immunity.

Vaccines will be very important to protect risk groups though.

&gt;but you can't. The ICU capacity for it isn't there. wishfull thinking doesn't create ventilators.

Reality disagrees with you. Stockholm had 2.5% active infections at 80% of ICU capacity. If you can manage R around 1 at that level you will get 20-30% immunity in a few months time. That's not full herd immunity, but it's enough to see a corresponding decrease in R, which makes managing the spread a lot easier.

&gt;Except here the fire is potentially millions of human lifes. So as little fire as posssile is the way to go.

That's why the focus should be on the things that matter, and the number one thing that determines the outcome of this is how well you manage to protect the risk groups.

698,"&gt;Edit: please answer my previous question why polish people are leaving for western Europe? I'm curious what you think.

&gt;Why are people moving from Poland to western Europe and no (significantly less) people moving from Western Europe to Poland. Really why is that?

We were lied to. We were told that Europe is Poland's future, but in reality it is Poland that is Europe's future.

If every music band is playing the same mainstream music style, then it is crucial that your band will play an alternative music style. That it will not compete in the mainstream - the most popular style with by far the biggest market, but also with the highest competition - but will try to find its nieche market and dominate it. Altough this market may be much smaller, but you have a chance that your share of it will be worth more than your much lower share in mainstream market.

People are moving from Poland to western Europe only because of wealth disparity. If we could manage to decrease the wealth gap, this trend will not stop. It will reverse. And I mean here westerners emigrating to Poland, not only polish imigrants coming back. The most important thing - we must offer them something else that their native countries are giving them. 180° reverse. A safe haven. No abortion, no sexual revolution, no high tax burdens and - the most importantly - no multiculturalism. Then the white working class people will be moving here despite then-minimum wealth gap.

The mainstream market here is liberal multicultural states. Sure, maybe it's the most popular option (yet), but still in every country there are a lot of people that hate it and would seek an alternative if they'd have a chance. For now this alternative is too expensive for most of them (we are too poor of a country), that's why our goal for the next decade is to lower our price so it will be as low as prices of our competition (be a wealthier nation). Then people will have an option, price will not play a role and only the ""music"" will be the factor. It would solve a lot of other problems then.

That's why it is crucial for us to not fall in line.",Poland,/r/europe/comments/g2dqfx/on_this_day_in_2003_the_treaty_of_athens_was/fnmybni/,Mandarke,1587080558

I very strongly disagree with what PiS is doing but I also think very often, especially in western media, it's blown way out of proportion. But that was not my point so I will not be debating that. Lets say Poland is a full-blown dictatorship now under PiS government. 

&gt;... who’s EMP’s vote on laws that affect the lives of every EU citizen 

That goes without saying. And I get that. But you only know that in retrospect. There was no way of knowing that PiS would be elected in Poland, that they would transform into the party they are today, that the political climate globally and in Poland would flavor them for one reason or another, that the opposition would be what it is etc, etc. Basically what I'm saying is that following that logic EU or any other international organisation should never exist, because one day some country might go haywire and that would be bad for all. 

That's what the second question was about. It was a hypothetical. I'm obviously not suggesting Austria has similar problems to Poland at the moment. But what if it did? What if the situation in your (or any other) country changed to favour a government that goes to carry out some shady reforms?

Trump's terrifying attitude to NATO demonstrates how a patchwork of other treaties to deal with each issue can result in ineffectiveness, we even see with COVID-19 the Russian and Chinese (and even sometimes American) propaganda machines leap to undermine our bonds at every opportunity.  
As the British electorate will eventually realise again, whatever we do, we'll _always_ end up back at this sort of stage where we need to all work together across the continent because bad shit will happen that will require co-operation to get though. We will need borders open for some things (or everything!), we'll all need to reduce fishing at the same time for the same length of time, we'll only reduce our emissions if we all agree to, etc.

If you have a large enough grid (like the proposed EU super grid), a smart grid (using storage and smart appiances which use energy when its cheap) or large amounts of grid scale storage (as has been installed in Australia and is currently being installed in Scotland) then you don't need nuclear. 

Furthermore, Wind energy is currently popular to balance the grid when fluctuations occur as turbines can be turned on and off instantly to match demand, whereas nuclear is slow to change it's output and as soon as you drop below max capacity, the price becomes even higher per MWh.

So I don't see what nuclear adds to the mix: it is slow to react, produces toxic waste, it takes ages to build and it is too expensive. By the time new nuclear plants will be built, at the current rate of price decline in the renewables industry, it will be entirely economically unfeasible.

It is beyond any of us to know exactly how ""old eu"" would have been if the enlargment hadn't taken place.

But what *looks* obvious is that the uneducated workforce in the ""old eu"" did not benefit from the massively increased competition.

Similarly, a country with positive balance of payments might be exporting primary goods and blocking imports, hampering the economy, or it might be receiving significant foreign investments and exporting services.

1185,"And it certainly is much more easier to understand than the actual growth type of viruses: Logistic function.

But tell people that viruses spreading rate is based on a logistic function and they have no idea what you talk about until you show them some graph.

Exponential growth speeds up... always.

Let's make a simple exponential function for new infected people with the often dreaded number ""3"".

Then you have 3 as base and x as the power, where x is the cycle rate. Say the cyclerate is 2 week, which means 1 infected person infect 3 people per week.

So 1 infected infects 3^1 people in those weeks. That results in 3.

Now those 3 would infect 3 in the next two weeks. To calculate that newly infected we just do 3^2 which is 9. Then the next cycle is 27... and so forth. At cycle 15 you would look at 14.348.907 newly infected people, which is scary...

At 20 cycles you would look at 3.486.784.401 newly infected people. That is almost half the human population of earth. **New** infections that is. And the next cycle infects 10.460.353.203 new people. We better start making a lot of new babies.

Exponential growth as a model falls apart for viruses. Virus spread slows down over time for natural causes:

* People get immune
* People are already infected
* People die

Now, that does not mean Merkel is wrong with her numbers. If there are too many people that need ICU care at once, you have a problem for a while, and that can also happen is the initial surging in a logistic function is too steep.

But that still is not exponential growth. Such a surge in a logistic function would also mean the slow down of the growth rate is happening earlier.

Exponential growth does not slow down over large numbers. It just scales faster.",,/r/europe/comments/g2ci8d/angela_merkel_explains_why_opening_up_society_is/fnkzjt4/,Varonth,1587043825

Because if they do not make those promises to electorate then electorate will instead vote for those who will. And there will always be someone to promise free stuff if it is so ridiculously easy to get elected thanks to those promises.

Right now you want assistance to come literally out of nowhere. Only individual member states have the actual resources to provide various assistance to other member states, whilst the EU only have a few dozen employees who can coordinate the delivery of this assistance. 

People who now blame the EU for the lack of response, are often the same people who attack the EU whenever it tries to strengthen authority of institutions of the European Union.

1223,"""Job stealing"" isn't the fundamental issue for most working class people, the issue is that free movement of people between hugely different economies drives down wages in the econony where cost of living is far higher.

British people are highly unlikely to be concerned about ""job stealing"", because they still get jobs. There was record unemployment in the UK before the current coronavirus crisis, but the UK's people have had to deal with consistently low wage growth whilst corporate profits, cost of housing, and cost of living generally, have risen.

Wages have risen slower than they should have because there is a huge labour pool of people will work for cheaper due to how hugely unequal Europe still is economically. Both economic migrants and the British are worse off when wages are depressed through such manipulation. Free movement of people between unequal economies is bad for people as a whole, but good for the minority who are business owners and shareholders.

Just saying, your outlook which just assumes British people are bigoted rather than living in poverty and relying upon food banks helps the non-working minority screw both economic migrants and the populations of the countries they come to for work.

There has been a lot of testing and experimental robotic approaches but aside from the technical difficulties (e.g. unreliable sensors under RL conditions) another big hurdle are the legal ramifications and the lack of proper legal framework:

Assume for example that a child runs around in a field and gets accidentally eaten by an automated harvesting machine. Is the farmer to blame? Or the company he bought the machine from? Or is it the developer who wrote the AI that didn't stop the machine in time?

Its the same problem with driver-less cars but since there is a big push in this direction this will eventually be solved.

Still, on the technical side it will probably mean not just buying the right machines but also restructuring the fields etc so these machines can work properly. AI cars can drive without drivers on roads because these provide excellent landmarks for machine sensors to stay on course. In fields you probably need lines of trees or something similar for harvesting machines to achieve the same.

Not everyone everywhere until further notice.

How this have been dealt with in many cases here instead is that the government can ask nicely (or even pressure a bit less nicely) all companies and establishments using economic means.
Like; they maybe can not forbid every person in Sweden from going skiing. They could however have better chances at forcing the ski-resort to shut down for a while and stop offering any services. And thus; no ski-lifts = no skiing so results could be similar but in implementation it is different.

I think in the specific case about ski-resorts I'm thinking about here though no-one was forced to do it, the management of the ski-resort shut down out of free will and with respect to the recommendations of government and epidemiologists instead.

Para 19 says a free trade agreement, the type of deal Canada has. Para 23 ""while preserving regulatory autonomy"", yet now the EU wants the UK to have no regulatory autonomy in areas that the EU decides. A number of other requests have made their way in too which contradict the agreement. If you read the agreement, it sets out the framework of a Canada style trade deal.

The UK has requested a regular free trade deal, similar to the Canadian deal, which the text supports. It seems you have no leg to stand on except to say that ""Canada"" is not written down, but the entire framework is. Could you point out what in the UK position contradicts the political declaration?

I agree that the EU has not ""betrayed"" the UK though, the EU has not had a consistent approach to foreign policy and relations with third countries, or the concept of EU diplomacy as a group, until relatively recently. As a result it just lacks coordination and a sense of cohesion, it also has to listen to it's members when they make ever more extreme requests. It seems like the issue is that the EU ""request sheet"" was passed back and forth between all of the bodies and parties within the EU, each trying to outdo the last in extremity. So we ended up with a list of requests where a number contradict the political declaration.

Neither side has been consistent. I think that both sides tend to blow up over what is actually normal. I.E. politicians being assholes, breaking their agreements, shifting goalposts, etc. The EU is just starting again with a deliberately extreme set of requests, that contradict the political agreement, because it believes that it can bargain down to a less extreme agreement.

Like, if country A examines a patient and the doctor then determines the cause of death to be c19 - if they instead counted using method of country B where they just check if the dead person was infected by c19 or not regardless of what actually killed them you're going to end up with a different set of numbers.

&gt; Ministry of Health statistics are underestimates as they are based on incomplete data.[369] Confirmed cases are those that test positive, but only those with severe symptoms are offered tests and testing may lag symptom onset by as much as a week.[369][370][371] On 7 March, the Ministry of Health estimated that the actual number of cases is at least 15 times higher than the number of confirmed cases.[372]

&gt; Deaths by coronavirus are also underestimated because they only consider confirmed cases, and many people die at home or in nursing homes without being tested.[369] In March, an estimated 4,260 people have died in nursing homes with coronavirus symptoms (out of 4,750 total deaths in the homes), but only 781 were diagnosed and counted as coronavirus fatalities.[373] Mortality reports by Carlos III Health Institute have found significant excess mortality beyond that explained by the official coronavirus death statistics. From 17 March to 4 April, the death rate in Spain was 47% higher than usual; the vast majority of excess deaths were the elderly and the worst affected communities were Castilla–La Mancha (188% higher), Castile and León (160% higher), and the Community of Madrid (143% higher). This is despite the fact that Madrid and Catalonia have not reported as many deaths as there are confirmed coronavirus deaths in those areas.[374] According to the institute's calculations, as many as 10,000 excess deaths occurred which were not counted in the official coronavirus mortality statistics, with further investigation needed to determine how many of them were due to the pandemic.[20][199]",Eskilstuna,/r/europe/comments/g23fuy/sweden_suffers_highest_daily_number_of_virus/fnkdsvl/,arbitrarily_named,1587023338

We may think for 1-2 years that we need to invest money in the health care system, or that we need more storage so that we are not so dependent on supplies, but then the balance between cost and benefit will come back into play and savings will be made again.

Friendly tip don't exercise until you are exhausted or it will have the opposite effect.

What you are looking for is to move your body until you START (keyword here) to be out of breath, stop let your body oxygenate and re-start, as soon as you don't feel like exercising anymore that's when you stop, this can be as slight as a feeling of none motivation, don't worry if you literally only did 1 exercise before getting this feeling the positive effect will be exactly the same and you will avoid exhaustion.

&amp;#x200B;

The main effects here are : lymphatic draining, oxygenation, better nutrient absorption within your bowls and hormone release. These all lead to a higher and better regulated immune system. (also works for allergies)

Do this every day without fail unless you feel exhausted, shouldn't take more than 10 minutes tops, for most of you it will literally take 1 minutes \^\^ (convenient)

1602,"&gt; maybe you are either pissed at Greeks as a nation, or you are sensitive about the possibility of discriminating against the Chinese because of the discrimination many Germans have done in the past. I don't know how else to explain your fervour and nerve. I'm not your punching bag, mate, knock it off.

Mate, a little while ago you slurred me when you thought I was American, now you color my motives by nations. Idgaf whether you're Greek, German, Chinese or American. Although I suspect you see the world otherwise since your 'leftist' comment makes me question whether you insist on the wet markets out of some 'Chinese are dirty' right wing idiot mind set.

I have a problem with the fact that you, for some reason, and without any evidence, have decided that the wet markets are the reason that Covid-19 exists. But that's just a theory among *many* others. It's not like I'm saying it can't be the wet markets(I'm with you on the fact that it's not made in a lab btw) but there's many other possibilities like a (very unlikely but not impossible) accident in a lab where they handled covid-19 samples before they knew what they had on their hands, or wild life, or (and this has been the favored theory apparently for the last few days) factory farming.

But we don't know yet. All we know is it first appeared in Wuhan and that some of the infected went to a wet market, others didn't. So stop saying that the wet markets *obviously* must have been where the jump happened. 

I've never been to a wet market, but I've travelled to a few places with *horrendous* food safety and animal welfare standards. They don't exist only in China. The whole theory smells of outdated Guns &amp; Germs right wing rhetoric.

So pardon me for wanting the facts, with science, instead of some good story that fits into an ideological world view. Thank you very much.",,/r/europe/comments/g1wagd/paul_mccartney_calls_for_medieval_chinese_markets/fnjutdv/,Yorikor,1587007503

&gt;""The Portuguese government certainly does not have the power to sabotage ham,"" said Lisbon's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Augusto Santos Silva.

And you base this on a few Reddit comments I wrote? Based on that metric I could say the same about you... Neither is probably true.

This comment chain started with me replying to a comment that implied a Hilly country far from Germany could never be wealthy. All I've been saying is geographic determinism is a weak argument and that humans and societies have agency over their future. South Korea, Finland, and Taiwan are some examples of countries that succeeded despite their geography.

None of what I said would be controversial in an undergraduate macroeconomics course at a university... 

&gt;Unless we're talking about our South, we happen to have more college graduates than pretty much everyone else. We're also the European country with most of such graduates doing unqualified jobs. Yeah, we have lots of engineers in Spain as well, you don't know that either. 

I actually do know things in Spain have been incredibly tough for Millenials, none of which they deserve. The housing bubble and the euro crisis were brutal.

The simple Northern Southern Europe doesn't do Spain any favors. Diplomatically put, Italy doesn't inspire confidence and Greece outright defrauded the EU. That's starting the game 0-2 behind in the court of public opinion. 

&gt;Many had to try their luck in Germany, but the thing is the sky is the limit only applies there if you're German, so it's just more single market BS.

Language and cultural barriers within Europe remain a big impediment to the Single Market's success. I'm 29 and work for a technology company, we expanded to the USA before we expanded to Germany. We still don't have operations in France, Spain, or Italy, because we anticipate language and culture will make it hard for us to do business.

And before they did Chinese scientists compared the genome of SARS-CoV-2 to other known viruses:

However, the coronavirus isolated from pangolin is similar at 99 percent in a specific region of the S protein, which corresponds to the 74 amino acids involved in the ACE (Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2) receptor binding domain, the one that allows the virus to enter human cells to infect them.

1862,"&gt; Right now the most likely explanation is the wet market

How did you calculate this likelihood?

&gt;and an alternative theory is the Wuhan bio lab

I think you're talking about the Wuhan CDC lab, where they did reasearch on SARS and coronaviruses, including bat research with the exact same Yunnanese bats that carry this outbreak's closest genetic match - SARSr-CoV RaTG13. [Yes, that lab is located literally across the street from the market.](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/04/coronavirus-spreads-leads-theories-origin-200407073509327.html) This researcher [here](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-chinas-bat-woman-hunted-down-viruses-from-sars-to-the-new-coronavirus1/) is an expert in these types of coronaviruses in bats. She worked there. The hospital where the first whisteblowers reported the first cases is closeby too. 

Yes, there is a lot more to this than most people are aware of.

&gt;A fringe conspiracy theory is the virus was manufactured in the US

This makes a lot of sense for various reasons, not least of all how the US did absolutely nothing to stop China from spreading the virus to their country, subsequently having to shut everything down and tanking their economy. But maybe it's all part of the plan /s

1920,"&gt; Chile has literal SLUMS.

Yes, there are a few of them. The vast majority of people don't live in those. Chile has an 8,6% poverty rate. Extreme poverty is 2,3%. If you are refering to sprawling favelas, we don't have those. If you're refering to shanty towns, there a few around, but they are small, and represent only a small percentage out of all poor people.

Antonina found out and had her revenge: she had Macedonia's tongue cut out, and then chopped into pieces and thrown into the sea.

The story was written down by Procopius in his Secret History and, after it was published in 17th century, became a dark joke: to chop something into pieces became known as ""to make a Macedonia out of something"".

1997,"&gt; Are there cultural reasons?  

I hope I am not going to start a fight. I don't want to. This is only my opinion. And you asked so I wanted to share my thoughts.

I think the reason is a socialist type of philosphy in which people who don't work are well taken care of and therefore incentivized not to produce. If half the people are willing to study hard, work hard, and produce good things but half are happy to just be given a nice life without doing anything, then half will just become blood suckers on the system. 

People often claim that for example the Swedish practice socialism but that is not true in many ways. I have noticed that the native Swedes like the Germans have a culture of expecting that each individual work hard to take care of themselves. So even if they provide welfare to people who don't work, there are not many of those people. There will be more of those people now because of so many foreigners.

The Mediterranean region has a lot of people who are happy to just take life easy. Like France, Spain, Egypt, Tunisia, there are many people who think it is normal to go to a cafe and spend hours a day or night doing nothing but drinking coffee or wine and talking about nothing. 

I think it is an effect of year round nice weather. 

Of course, there are many very hard working Greeks. But it is a matter of percentages. Even a few extra percent of people willing to just have an easy life living off others will destroy your economy once you start offering them free welfare to sit around and enjoy their life. So there are more Greeks happy to be parasites on the system than native Germans. There are parasites in Germany too. But fewer. And that makes all the difference.

We see the differences here in America. I won't mention too specifically but I will say that even a different of adding only 10 to 20% of certain types of people into another group of people here comes with guaranteed extra crime and poverty and poor education outcomes for everybody. Can you imagine? You can have a social problem created by only adding 10% people who cause the problems. Even with 90% who are behaving in a way which benefits the society, things still fall apart.

So this is the problem. I blame a lack of winter. Two hundred years ago, if you didn't prepare in summer for winter in Sweden, you and your family would die. So irresponsible people who didn't prepare didn't survive. There is no real winter in the Mediterranean to eliminate the types of people who won't prepare.

2002,"Franco moved his forces directly towards Madrid since the beginning of the war and tried to capture the city using most of his troops, with him personally directing the attack. But he couldn't. Not because a lack of effort on his part, but because he simply couldn't. Every street was fought, every building was fought. The fight for Ciudad Universitaria was the Stalingrad of the Spanish Civil war.

After losing many troops and plenty of failed attempts to capture the city, he had to change his war strategy and move to other parts of Spain. Sadly, the war ended they way it did, the fascists entered in Madrid and Spain suffered 40 years of fascist dictatorship, but that doesn't change the fact that Franco tried his best to capture Madrid and he couldn't until the Republic surrendered.

He thought that the coup was going to last some weeks at most, not years.

But seriously, now pretending they are capable of coordinating how measures over 27 countries should be withdrawn? Pathetic. Just pathetic. 

What is going to happen is that countries will do what they think is best, and maybe they will go along to pretend that Commission is actually advising them on it just to help them save a little face after this ludicrous claim. Waste of time and money. Countries can do this themselves. National governments are responsible for if it goes wrong and they need to tighten measures again, so they should be free to decide how to act here. 

Only where countries are risking seriously impeding the internal market or basic democratic rights (looking at Hungary here), and the health reasons for the measures are paperthin or non-existent, then that is a moment where I'd expect the Commission to raise their hand and say something.

I am quite critical towards our Government and the thing is that tricks our President (yes, just him because no other related people are involved in decision making) does a lot of people from the outside see it differently than us. Like you mentioned, criticising EU recently and welcoming Chinese aid for Covid-19 is so funny.   


A lot of people abroad have this image that we are Russian puppets, but I can assure you that big guys for our traitors (politicians) are Germany first, then the rest of EU and at the end there is Russian influence. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you look it objectively, our president does many things which Russians would never do neither our people (everything related to Kosovo, [welcoming Schroeder](https://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics.php?yyyy=2017&amp;mm=03&amp;dd=27&amp;nav_id=100866) in his campaign, lightening the main Belgrade sites in German color on a day when Belgrade was bombed by Germany, praising them and their factories, not being open by defending Russia from sanctions...etc)  


Bad comments about EU are just his way of making point votes from the audience as majority of Serbs [are against joining it](https://www.blic.rs/vesti/politika/pridruzivanje-srbije-eu/d1dlzm8). But, he is literally pushed and tolerated by EU leaders as they close their eyes for media darkness and a lot of controversies where the top of our Government is involved. Why? I mean, we were bombed for the ""same reasons"" - now they don't give a damn, because they need him to follow orders previous Gov. would never do.  


Also we were never part of USSR as Moldavia and I don't see a connection. Bulgaria and Romania joined EU with worse roads and bigger corruption than Serbia (ask them) but I doubt they have better life after it. Bulgaria is the most shrinking nation in the world. Croatia, yes, they do have slightly better standard, but 500.000 Croats left their country in the past 5 years.

2148,"Okay, let's break this down.

Sweden has the eighth highest amount of deaths per capita in the world. It has the 6th in the Eu (I stated 7th elsewhere but mistakenly forgot to remove Switzerland from the tally).

That means Sweden has a comparatively high amount of deaths per capita, period, not debatable. 

Saying it has a comparatively low amount for the measures it's taken is not being intellectually honest since the debate is about the effects of the measures that Sweden has taken compared to other alternatives. We know the answer to that, Swedens measures have placed it within the top 10 worst affected countries in terms of death per capita.

In fact, assuming there are countries with as lax measures as Swedens (I don't have a list of all countries measures and did not compare them) Sweden would be one of the ones with the highest death count of them all simply by virtue of its overall high death rate. 

&gt;I would say given the circumstances

The circumstances created by the Swedish government. 

&gt;Swedish hospitals aren’t being overwhelmed like has happened elsewhere.

I don't think there are more than 5 countries which reported hospitals being overwhelmed and they are all with higher death rates than Sweden. It's actually quite a rare occurrence up until now so hardly anything to be proud of that it didn't happen.

&gt;Certainly low enough to justify keeping the current levels of restrictions in place.

2158,"Yeah, agreed. That makes sense to me too, numbers I've seen for Sweden have specifically been about ""number of beds"" and this is obviously not the same as ""number of licensed doctors"".
In Sweden, previously retired doctors have also returned from retirement changing the numbers a bit more.
Now; if we would take this group of ""new"" doctors and try to put a number on how efficient and skilled they can be considered it will also be some tricky math to do.

Maybe their extra years of experience make a positive difference?
Maybe the time passed since they graduated and progress of practices since will make a negative difference per patient served compared to their younger counterparts?
Maybe their contribution shows to equal plus/minus zero in this hypothetical overall score, and if so them staying at home from the beginning instead would have left positive marks in the overall risk/reward leaderboards considering their age?

My overall point is the same though, there are many variables involved in something like this and it will not be possible to point at a single number to say something about ""the entire equations success"", we need all the data and sum up all the totals to know anything for certain (at least if we're doing science and not politics) and until we know anything for sure it's all too easy to get political or competitive with a focus that is a bit more ""short term wins"" than it is about ""collective global success of this generation people and the next"".
Like how periods of famine in a population can be statistically measured even a couple of generations later, I don't think we have any numbers so far to say anything what the effects of this will be next year, next decade, next generation etc.

Other numbers we don't have right now are also for instance what will happen with rate of infection in nations when restrictions are lifted (or on the other hand any data on if herd immunity will even be effective on this specific virus for that matter or if it was all just a big waste of time), this is also leaving huge holes of sorts in the math since well.. it is very much expected to be more infections in Sweden than the more shut-down neighbours, we can probably even say that it is all kind of ""according to plan"".
Maybe other nations will ""catch up"" when this happens or maybe they will not. Maybe a vaccine is available within the year but maybe it is not. Maybe they can sit at home and hold out until the vaccine is here... maybe they can not.

Neither nations that are under strict close-down or those that are not have data to answer these questions or ""scientifically defend their positions"" for their own homelands as far as I'm aware, the history is being written as we speak.",,/r/europe/comments/g1tmbf/ive_never_written_so_many_death_certificates_is/fni095i/,kallqvist,1586971790

If you already accept the fact that, in the special case when its your offspring, society has decided you are rquired to help it survive, then the issue is no longer if you have to give it food or not, but for how long.

Then they saw some barbed wire up ahead and some huge piles that they initially thought were logs but turned out to be dead bodies...

That interview is worth a listen but it gives absolutely no sense of the scale of the thing. At that time there were 60,000 prisoners still (only just) alive in the camp, no one had eaten for six weeks and there were over 13,000 unburied dead bodies strewn around.

Brian, now Sir Brian, and still I believe alive at the age of 101, went on to have quite an incredible life.

11.4% is the direct contribution
16.9% is both direct and indirect contribution

&gt;The Order of Knights of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem (Latin: Ordo Fratrum Hospitalis Sancti Ioannis Hierosolymitani), commonly known as the Knights Hospitaller, the Knights of Malta, or the Order of Saint John, was a medieval and early modern Catholic military order. It was headquartered in the Kingdom of Jerusalem until 1291, on the island of Rhodes from 1310 until 1522, in Malta from 1530 until 1798.

And 

&gt;In 1565 Suleiman sent an invasion force of about 40,000 men to besiege the 700 knights and 8,000 soldiers and expel them from Malta and gain a new base from which to possibly launch another assault on Europe.[15] This is known as the Great Siege of Malta.",eon,/r/europe/comments/g1g250/on_this_day_in_1942_king_george_vi_awarded_the/fnh8nbc/,Chrzaszczyrzewonszyc,1586957445

2376,"&gt; David Frost, the Prime Minister’s chief Brexit negotiator, has held discussions with the First Secretary of State Dominic Raab and other senior ministers in the last few days. As I say in tomorrow’s Spectator, the conclusion of these discussions has been that the UK will not request an extension to the transition period. Interestingly, I understand that no one in these discussions backed asking for an extension.

&gt; The thinking is that a delay would not solve the fundamental policy problems and that a deal is either possible or not. Another factor, I understand, is that the government worries about the cost of any extension. There is concern that extending could drag the UK into the arguments about who pays for the various EU schemes designed to protect the European economy and preserve the Eurozone. It is worth remembering that it isn’t only the UK who can request an extension to the transition period. There is nothing to stop the EU proposing one – though, the EU has acted as if requesting an extension is a decision for London alone.

&gt; If the EU did ask for more time, it would put the government in a difficult position. Rejecting the request would sit ill with the idea that the UK wants to be a good neighbour to the EU. Frost and Michel Barnier will video conference today. But it now seems that the only way the transition period will be extended is if the EU requests it.",,/r/europe/comments/g1rzf4/the_uk_will_not_request_an_extension_to_the/fnh8zh8/,signed7,1586957664

Not funny.

You gonna cry too? Admit it, you don't know what you are talking about. ""just use google"" isn't an answer. There isn't a single factual thing you said that you can back up.

&gt;Just search one thing, how many Christians live in Turkey today and throughout the years.

The numbers decreased, because there was a population exchange program that resulted in a lot of Greeks leaving the country. Same thing could be said about various Balkan countries' Muslim population. This literally says nothing about Turkey. It was an international program to re-shape demographics throughout post-ottoman lands.

&gt;Yeah massacres mostly happened towards Turkish Cypriot because they were the minority.

You told me to ""not over dramatize"". That is not a decent thing to say to anyone. I would not say it to Greeks about Pontus and İzmir, or Armenians about the Genocide, and I would in turn expect the same about Turkish culling in İzmir, and village raids by Armenians. When people die, get oppressed, there is nothing to over dramatize. There is just drama.

&gt;And when turkish army came they did the same to the Greeks (probably as revenge or just hate).

What do you even know about the invasion my dude? Shut your trap. Militaries belonging to entire countries are not a band of bandits. These men were soldiers with orders, and Turkey was a part of NATO, as Greece was, too.

Meaning that you are the one trying to create a sob story about the ""big bad turkey coming and kicking Cypriots teeth in"".

&gt;You are clearly irrelevant to the topic,and probably don't know about half the things i talked about.Probably you read some headlines here and there and whatever you learned in school.

Someone as ignorant as you does not get to play that card. You are telling me that I was subjected to propaganda, but as you can realize for yourself, I am able to use foreign sources of information. I am not limited to what my country provides. I have heard it from all sides. The American, the British, the Greek, and the Turkish. The invasion was there to establish order, and what you call an illegal occupation, is a relic of mistrust against the Cypriot government. Turkey established a puppet state, so it can protect the Turks the local government won't. If Turkey was to just invade and leave, nothing would have changed, and Turkey would have just been blamed for ""yet another massacre"". The state was established so it wasn't for nothing.

If you think Turks are just brainwashed and there really is just one side, you are more fucked up then I initially thought.

2455,"Making what up? You need to stop using the idiotic term ""herd immunity plan"" like an gullible fool. The criticism from scientists made the government move faster with the ramping up of the measures the plan already outlined because it suggested they had underestimated the situation at the time. However, the plan was *always* to close schools, move to working from home, close non-essential sectors, limit public movement etc. That was the plan even before the words ""herd immunity"" were heard on TV. You can read the damn reports from the scientists yourself. All the new data did was change the time frame the government had hoped for. 

The WHO criticism was to do with the lack of track and trace in the UK which, given we can't even get enough tests for hospitals right now, was never very viable. 

Most of what you believe is true. However, by framing it with this ludicrous idea that there was this thing called the ""herd immunity plan"" which didn't pan out, and suggesting that there was no Plan B in place, you are supporting an idiotic narrative concocted by tabloid journos to present a dumbed down version of reality to the public that is insulting to the British scientific community. 

The social distancing plan has been the plan all along. Government plans are designed to be reactive to new data. When new data emerged, the plan that was in place from the very beginning reacted in the way that was planned from the very beginning with the introduction of the more severe measures: most of which were already recommended by the plan well in advance. 

Get your head out of this childish reality where scientists don't plan for multiple contingencies and don't react as data emerges. Stop contributing the mass idiocy that has turned the words ""herd immunity"" into a dirty word and code for ""let people die"".

Since this started out as a debate about abortion we also need to examine the differences between a fetus and a child. A child is capable to exist without it's parents although it's life is certainly impaired by the lack of a family. A fetus on the other hand can't exist without the direct input of it's mother thereby being a extension of her being more than an independent organism.

If you were actually engaging your brain you would be talking about the government underestimating the speed of the virus's spread and being unrealistic about the speed at which full societal lockdown would need to be implemented. The Imperial study brought to light the fact that the speed at which measures were planned to be introduced underestimated the virus. That's where the 260,000 figure comes from.

Instead, you are reiterating this fictional term, ""herd immunity plan"" and doing a discredit to scientists everywhere.

Moreover, the Health care system is the last on the EU ranking, we don’t have any R&amp;D and our military is based around a couple of F16 and 40 years old T-72 tanks. There’s no fleet, the military schools underwent a purge of generals ( a couple dozen of them gave their resignation when they had to get orders from a 24 years old pharmacian without degree). The corruption and nepotism is rampant, more than 1000 family members and friends are in public companies or in different Ministries.  Polish PIS high ranking politicians are also making money together with pimps and the mafia. They are also giving millions of euros from public money to the Catholic Church. They are paying trolls to spew hate on Facebook, via Whatsapp and on the web. Some of them are hiding and not prosecuting pedophiles in the Catholic Church. I mean, not to diminish Trump’s “awesomness” but imagine if the WHOLE republican party in the US was Trump-like. Shady deals, family in the govt, creating discord, staffing courts with their own judges. As a lawyer, as a person that studied pol.sc., I’m just mortified. Read the below to understand, albeit 1/10, the most important scandals. 

##Destruction of the rule of law.

Some of the passages below are taken from [this pdf](https://www.esiweb.org/pdf/ESI-Batory%20Polands%20deepening%20crisis%2014%20December%202019.pdf)

No member state in the history of the EU has ever gone as far in subjugating its courts to executive control as the current Polish government. The Polish case has become a test whether it is possible to create a Soviet-style justice system in an EU member state; a system where the control of courts, prosecutors and judges lies with the executive and a single party.

Too few Europeans are aware of the depth of this crisis. Across Europe, national courts recognise the
judgements of courts in other member states, whether these involve commercial law, the European arrest warrant or child custody. Judges must assume that courts across the EU operate according to common values and principles set out in the European Union Treaty and in its Charter of Fundamental Rights. Once judges across the EU have reason to doubt whether courts in any member state provide effective judicial protection, the legal order on which the EU rests collapses.

[Freedom house - How PIS captured Poland’s Courts](https://freedomhouse.org/report/special-reports/hostile-takeover-how-law-and-justice-captured-poland-s-courts) 

###Constitutional Tribunal changes

It all began with the constitutional crisis four years ago. [Constitutional crisis and the destruction of the rule of law](https://reconnect-europe.eu/blog/koncewicz-polish-constitutional-court/) In 2015, parliament changed the law on the Constitutional Tribunal, which rules on the constitutionality of legislation. The changes allowed them to annul the nominations of three judges made by the previous parliament and appoint their own. It shortened the terms of the tribunal's president and vice-president from nine to three years. The tribunal ruled the move unconstitutional in an open rebellion, but the dispute remains unresolved. [Julia Przylebska](http://www.warsawvoice.pl/WVpage/pages/article.php/37549/news) - was illegally named the president of the Tribunal court by the president. 

There's too much to describe. For further info please visit the link. It is an amazing summary of the whole ordeal. [timeline](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-poland-chronology/chronology-poland-clashes-with-eu-over-judicial-reforms-rule-of-law-idUSKBN1JU25U) and another [Great freedomhouse report](https://freedomhouse.org/report/special-reports/hostile-takeover-how-law-and-justice-captured-poland-s-courts). 

###Supreme Court changes

The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, said one of the most controversial reforms was to do with the Supreme court, which, among other duties, is responsible for confirming election results. The idea was to lower the age of retirement for Supreme Court justices from 70 to 65, but allow the Polish president to grant a five-year extension to whomever they deemed worthy. In 2019, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) — the EU's highest court —ruled this was illegal, after an interim decision ordered 20 already-sacked judges be reinstated. Of course, PIS chose 2 new Constitutional judges, A politician Pawlowicz with communistic past and Piotrowicz, also a politician and a prosecutor that was an active communist during the 80 that prosecuted Solidarnosc. Both of them are above 65 years old.

###Ordinary court judges

There were also moves to try a similar tactic in the general court system for judges and public prosecutors, lowering the age of retirement for women to 60 and for men to 65, down from the current 67. Under the reforms the justice minister, who is appointed by the ruling party, would have the power to extend a judge's term. The laws were somewhat adjusted after pressure from the European Commission, but in November 2019 the ECJ shot down these laws, too, citing gender discrimination and political influence over the judiciary.

###Disciplinary measures for judges

Another PiS addition allowed judges to be investigated and sanctioned for their court rulings. The disciplinary hearings and procedures were to be carried out by judges selected via parliament. These reforms were criticized by the European Commission because ""judges are not insulated from political control and thus judicial independence is violated."" The commission brought legal action against Poland on this matter in October 2019.

###National Council of the judiciary takeover

In 2017 PiS remodelled the National Council of the Judiciary, which selects candidates for appointment as judges by the President of the Republic. This allowed it, in the short term, to control appointments to the Supreme Court – including to a newly created Disciplinary Chamber, which hears disciplinary cases against judges, and to a new Extraordinary Appeals Chamber, which adjudicates on electoral issues. Over time PiS’ take-over of the National Judicial Council allows it to reshape the entirety of the judiciary. Fifteen of the 25 members of the National Council of the Judiciary were previously elected by judges themselves, as is common practice across Europe for such bodies. These fifteen judges are now elected by the majority in the Sejm, the lower chamber of the Polish parliament. The other ten members of the National Council of the Judiciary are: four members from the Sejm itself (all four members of PiS), two members from the Senate, one representative of the President of the Republic, the Minister of Justice, the president of the Supreme Court and the president of the Supreme Administrative Court. In total 23 of the 25 positions are directly appointed by political authorities. 

After the election of the new KRS, a publication of the list with the names of judges declaring their support for specific candidates was refused. The Supreme Administrative Court ruled that those names must be disclosed. However, the Chancellery of the Sejm has yet to carry out the NSA’s ruling. The Constitutional Tribunal (TK) and the President of the Personal Data Protection Office have been roped into guarding the secret. [KRS destruction](https://ruleoflaw.pl/faced-with-doubts-over-bodys-legality-judiciary-council-president-remains-unrepentant/)

###Restructuring the courts

Ahead of the 2019 election, the PiS proposed restructuring the court system. The justice minister said the country had four levels of courts that could be reduced to three. Critics said this could allow the government to reappoint most judges and get rid of undesirable ones through forced retirement or by sending them to distance appointments.",,/r/europe/comments/g1n1et/protesting_poles_engage_in_drive_for_abortion/fngsu1j/,Logiman43,1586943663

2700,"&gt; making the monetary policy that fits their economies. 

Many of those things verifiable that you say are correct, if provocative, but not on ECB politics. Quantitative easing is done against German will. QE though imperfect allowed growth in a moribund Eurozone suffocated by austerity types of policy. It also serves to lower interests rates so that countries can get funds more easily. The ECB is using its very narrow mandate to its limits in order to partially replace the economic policy that the EU or the Netherlands and Germany will not do (within their borders, negatively affecting the Eurozone). ""Partially replace"" because as Mario Draghi said, the ECB's support for the economy through monetary policy can only go so far, and supportive fiscal policy is needed from certain member states. (As opposed to frugality or austerity)

Maybe you were thinking of the ECB and its mandate being made based on the atypical Bundesbank, or of the ECB reacting so late with QE because of German pressure. Still, in the end Germany lost.

On Sunday, the Chinese embassy published on its website a long text titled ""Restoring distorted facts – Observations of a Chinese diplomat posted to Paris"".

The diplomat, who was not named in the text, sharply criticised the Western response to the coronavirus outbreak as laggardly.

But most pointedly, the diplomat accused workers at nursing homes in France of ""abandoning their posts overnight... and leaving their residents to die of hunger and disease"".

That comment sparked fury across the political spectrum, with people leaping to the defence of nursing home workers.",,/r/europe/comments/g1lx2t/france_summons_chinese_ambassador_over_virus/fnge1fx/,Nunyabeezkneez,1586929388

Yeah, like Spanish overpopulation since killed anything from 150k to 2 million Spanish people.

It was a failure under all points of view. It sparked in a civil war that then degenerated on a civil war even between the lines of those who opposed the fascists.
It did gave legitimacy to all Europeans that feared the revolution. 

&gt; It also attempted to separate church and state 

The number of members of the clergy executed during the revolution is estimated to be around 7,000 the Sagrada Famila itself was set on fire by the Anarchists. 

I mean in a way I supposed that there was an attempt of separating the church by the state by separating Christians from their mortal coil.

2743,"Economy as a science has some severe problems, the most important one that there really isn't a proper ""test group"". You can't say what would've happened if we did something differently, we can hypothesize, look at different policies in different countries and look at general trends, but even at best, it is still heavy approximations. This is a problem that plagues a lot of social sciences.

The other major issue is that economics is simply awfully complex. Literally every human and every organisation on the planet is part of the economy and they are all willing agents, that act on their free will. Economics tries to aggregate the individual agents into a general theory based on general behavioural patterns. And it works OK during ""normal times"". But models tend to break down during periods of boom and bust.

Models (which are where IMF and everyone else gets their projections) are based on numeric and statistical inputs. I.e we put in projections for unemployment, inflation and change in international trade and based on that they project economic growth. It works fine during normal times when unemployment numbers, inflation and foreign trade are fairly easy to project. But now... nobody knows what happens to the underlying numbers. 

Of course the underlying numbers are also modelled, but the same issues persist. We don't know where these numbers are going. There's just too much uncertainty. When every part of the chain of economy gets a sudden shock, models just stop working, because they have to assume that only some things change and others are kept constant in at least a small time window.",,/r/europe/comments/g16mki/imfs_new_european_economic_projections_gdp_growth/fngegm4/,sanderudam,1586929740

It's loans, Italy will have to repay the €39B with interests. The value of that loan is that it won't affect Italy's interest rates for the loans it takes or repays in its own name.

The reason they don't take that ESM loan is that there's a risk for at least a chunk of it to be used to impose austerity and ordoliberal reforms on Italy from outside. From outside means that they will happen regardless of what or whom Italians vote for. I would refuse it as well. I'm glad my country won't need it.

Way to go!

Bravo, exquisite strategy guys. I wonder who really profits from this mantra which keeps going since more than a decade. Maybe those countries who don't need to finance in the first place and willingly chose to do so by not investing and that at the same time can still profit from the erosion of the industrial capacity and national assets of the countries, so pretty much everyone else, which are sitting in a worse, and usually, much worse, situation than themselves?

2882,"I was waiting for this comment . IMF cannot tell the future. Its economic projections are missing the human factor which is sometimes forgotten in math.      
For example
Unemployment in countries that don't allow firing of people and give money to people and businesses so that the economy will be ready to get back up is not the same with an economy where people are being fired and no coverage is given by a nation. 
Unless IMF is informed for each countries policies to protect its people from unemployment and gdp these projections are bollocks. 
A country can simply go into more dept to increase its GDP to increase consumption. 
The same way that if a nation decreases spending (Greece for example 2010) its GDP will fall as a result (depending on how heavily country's GDP is being a result of government spending ). 
I am actually surprised they released numbers these early lacking big picture and info about policies since these seem to be introduced day by day depending on a business affected.

2915,"&gt;  People understandably don't trust Italy after many decades of mismanagement

[The high level of Italian public debt is due to legacy debt from the 1980s and 1990s. Since the mid-1990s, however, the various Italian governments have made considerable efforts to reduce the debt burden, even if this is usually ignored in the media: Since 1995, the Italian government has achieved a substantial primary surplus almost continuously; in other words: excluding interest payments, government revenue has exceeded government expenditures. Since 1995, the Italian state has posted a primary surplus in 24 out of 25 years; the crisis year 2009 was the only exception so far. Due to the fiscal consolidation measures implemented since the financial and economic crisis, Italy achieved primary surpluses even in the years before the corona crisis despite weak growth and declining tax revenues. However, despite these primary surpluses, the public debt ratio could only be stabilised at around 130% of GDP.](https://wiiw.ac.at/italy-is-of-systemic-importance--european-solutions-are-needed-n-438.html)

It's a strategy that has been used a lot by neoliberals worldwide in the last 30 years, i.e. the current globalisation period.

For instance, the EU has been pressuring France for years so that it privatizes its dams, but it leaves Germany alone on this issue. There are national specificities that explain this. France can refuse but since both parties are consistently negotiating this or that and pressuring each other, over time things do get privatized because of the EU rather than just national decisions.

and that means all the provisions of the ESM, among them the ""Two Pack"" rule (472/2013, basically a fiscal monitor and forced budget review), and many, many other laws, norms, trojans that interfere with the state economy.

But there is more:

*The credit line will be available until the COVID 19 crisis is over. Afterwards, euro area Member States would remain committed to strengthen economic and financial fundamentals, consistent with the EU economic and fiscal coordination and surveillance frameworks*

This could mean that, as the covid emergency is over, you WILL still be bound to some form of fiscal and economical scrutiny, as the deficit will be literally skyrocketing. This dangerously smells of Troika (or a troika clone), and we can clearly remember what was done to Greece.

So, i know that 38 bil are a lot of money (btw, we do not need money for the healt system, we need money to restart the economy), but it is really not worth the hassle subscribing to a fiscal behemoth like the ESM, given that Italy can still access the common debt markets (and raise a lot more of money, without the obivious strings attached).

Obviously this kind of parameter (gdp per capita) is not the sole way of measuring a country well being, but if you look for similar statistics (wage increase, purchase power, etc) you will see that they are barely at pre 2008 levels, and keep in mind there have been 10 years of austerity at play.

At this point even assuming you genuinely don't know anything about how portugal was destroyed in the past, you can find plenty of proof by googling or by the fact that portughese here in reddit are extremely strongly against esm.

It initially clashed with Brussels by reversing public spending cuts and allowing the deficit to swell well above agreed objectives, before ultimately proving to EU officials that by putting more money in people’s pockets it could lift growth, and make it easier to meet budget targets. 
“People were highly sceptical about our economic policies,” Mr Costa tells the Financial Times. “But we have shown that it is possible to raise incomes, lift private investment, cut unemployment and still have sound public finances.”

We're losing about 20-30 people a day. There have been two occasions since this started that it was higher than the mid-30s.

We are not seeing anything like exponential growth in cases. We have successfully flattened the curve. 

There is zero chance of the full lockdown being extended, again. The public simply won't tolerate being put under house arrest and banned from seeing their families for any longer.

The government asked us to make a sacrifice for two weeks. We did. Then they unilaterally imposes a 150% extension a day before it was supposed to end. The Acting Taoiseach spent every remaining bit of political capital and public sympathy he had on that. 

Any extension of the lockdown will lead to instant widespread noncompliance, which will make it impossible for any lockdown to be put in place in the future. There is already a blanket refusal to comply amongst certain minority communities, and ordinary people will chafe at this being allowed to continue while they're threatened with jail for making mammy a cup of tea.

3155,"&gt; There isn't any easing because there's barely been a rise.

We had our highest amount of new cases in a day on April 10th and the days since then have all been in our top five highest cases per day. Our cases per capita are also higher than those of many European countries which are still imposing severe restrictions, for example the United Kingdom. I don't see how this reads as us having successfully gotten the virus under control or being ready to go back to normal? Countries like Italy and Spain are long past peak cases and yet they're barely even talking about easing.

&gt; There is zero chance of the full lockdown being extended, again. The public simply won't tolerate being put under house arrest and banned from seeing their families for any longer.

Maybe you won't, but I don't get that impression at all for the general population. Ireland has an incredibly lax population and numerous European countries which are much more easily upset have happily been under lockdown for much longer. You'd do well not to generalise your own anger and impatience to the broader population.

&gt; The government asked us to make a sacrifice for two weeks. We did. Then they unilaterally imposes a 150% extension a day before it was supposed to end.

The government never said that it would be for two weeks and two weeks only, it was always open to extension and an extension was obvious to everyone who was paying attention. And of course they imposed the extension unilaterally - do you think they were going to host a referendum on it? Lol.

Again, you might hate the lockdown, and you might want to disobey it simply out of your personal dislike for the acting government, but that doesn't make it the case that Ireland is ready to ease the lockdown. There's a marginal chance that they will ease restrictions if they fear that it's not politically viable to extend them, but it won't be because the science says they're not necessary anymore.

However, without the chemical industry and large scale medical production facilities, mere knowledge of how to produce tests is not a factor in how quickly production can be ramped up.

It's laughable, and frankly insulting, that you accredit your superior testing capacity to superior scientific expertise on behalf of German scientists when Germany is objectively pretty mediocre when it comes to theoretical science in the first place (your university system does not encourage the best scientists to stay when grants and salaries are so much larger abroad). Clearly an example of national exceptionalism if you truly believe the scientists in Germany are that different to those in other European nations.

However, when you hold a disproportionate quantity of Europe's production infrastructure and chemical stores within your borders, purely because other countries have handed over those sectors to your country as part of an economic union, advanced by national ordoliberal policies in a ""free market"" system, your country gets the tests first and other countries have to wait.

&gt;And checked where Cyprus drilling is happening?

That's why i said i didn't support this, can you even read? 

&gt;If you are so blind that this to you is just an inconvient dont play the democratic Mehmet to me.

Wtf does that even mean? I don't ""play"" anything, you think i would change my actual view just to get your approval? Talk about delusional lol. 

What i'm defending is that Turkey's claims around Kastelorizo. Because it's way more sensible. Other examples of similiar situations around the world basically support Turkey's claim. No one ignores a huge coastline because of a small island. And since Turkey didn't sign UNCLOS Greece can't even claim that EEZ without the approval of Turkey anyway. (Also UNCLOS itself says that signatories must negotiate with non signatories to establish an EEZ). 


&gt;""we have giant coast line"" which by the way Greece has even bigger and threaten that its not gonna end well for Greece if they dont give half the Aegean.

I was talking about East Mediterrenean. Territory arround Kastelorizo. I couldn't care less about what Erdogan says, but even he said no such thing. 

&gt;Aegean.Pretty much all the Turkish claims are ""whatever you have ,we want half of that for now"".

Not at all, Turkish claims on the Agean only aims to stop Greece from expanding their territorial waters from 6 nms to 12 nms. Which would block Turkey's access from Black Sea to the Mediterrenean. Nobody claims half of the Agean, Greece claims all of it though. Greek coast guard even opened fire on Turkish merchant ships a few years ago. And they keep harassing small fishing boats. Not to mention Greece violating several agreements by stationing troops and heavy equipment on demilitarised islands. 

&gt;You are so delusional that you yourself even acknowledge that your claims are so dumb that you can't even argue about it.

No, i actually have some brain cells and am mature enough to acknowledge when we do something wrong. Something you can't do. 

&gt;Plus last time i checked its not like 1 month before the earthquake Greece tried to destabilise Turkey or vice versa.That's again hypocritical.

By that logic every second of refugees staying here due to a deal we signed with EU (and they didn't keep their end) is EU trying to destablize Turkey. 

&gt;Its not like you saving the world, you just send some help to countries that you want take advantage in the future (looking at balkans).

Or that's just you being paranoid, and a genuinely bad person by not wanting them to get supplies because you happened to have a beef with us.

 No one's gonna start supporting Turkey because of a few masks. EU has a partial export ban on masks and is not helping non EU Balkan countries enough (if at all). Most of the Balkan countries themselves have requested help from Turkey before we've sent those supplies.

&gt;At the current situation i would rather die than get help from someone that want to pretty much destroy/take advantage of Greece, Cyprus

&gt;any country that is such a cunt as Turkey.

I know you attempted this to be a mindblowing example, but it really wasn't. It didn't make any sense and just made me chuckle. 

&gt;Its not oversimplifying.Its just the truth that Turkey wants to distort in order to push their agenda.

You're right, you aren't oversimplifying. You are outright spreading shitty propaganda. My mistake. 

&gt;Because you know if you outright claim everything that you want you will even get rejected from eu.By doing that you apply more international pressure on Greece, Cyprus and you don't look as aggressive.Same thing happened during the nazi era and the whole appeasement thing.Where the great powers made sacrifices in order to not start a war with hitler.But it was inevitable.

3198,"&gt;  But we are not in a position where it's worth spending 50k to get someone to pay 25k.

The trick is that they'll have to pay their lawyer on top of the 25k they owe in taxes. Actual tax evaders will have to assume that going to court will cost them more -- unless they can reasonably expect the state to eventually just give up if they drag it out long enough.

&gt; So the tax collection officers have to prioritise unless they get more resources. But the state has a big debt, with a high interest, which actually means less money, which means less tax collected, which means less money... Etc

Tax inspectors are easily the single most worthwhile investment a government can make, anywhere, even in countries that have much less of a problem with tax evasion. They bring in a multiple of what they cost (and they do earn very well), it's just that getting audited isn't popular so there's a political limit.

Prioritization will always be a part of it, of course, and going after ""small fish"" rarely is where the money is anyway (unless they work in a sector where tax evasion is extremely common). But if the odds of getting audited are slim, and if you still have a chance to get around paying by dragging it out in court when you get caught, then that's a lack of enforcement which essentially makes taxes a voluntary contribution.  

I know it isn't, but fighting tax evasion *should* be a popular policy -- most people don't even have an opportunity to evade taxes in a meaningful way, and *they* are the ones who have to make up for what others, and usually high income earners at that, evade. And as far as I know, Italy has very high taxes on income.  
Businesses that pay their taxes not only have to pay more, they often lose business to competitors that can offer their services at a lower (tax-free or less-taxed) price.

Of course this is much easier said than done, it's just that there doesn't seem to be as much of an effort as there should be. It might well be as you said:

3210,"&gt;Yes. I'm responsible for the actions of Tuđman and HOS during the 90's even though I was born during the late 90's and had nothing to do with it.

I'm a remainer and didn't vote for Brexit, yet you're quite happy to tar me with the same brush, not nice is it?

&gt;Not to mention I despise the usage of Ustashe symbolism and I'm left leaning so I don't see how that makes me an Ustaša sympathizer? You still are dodging that question in my original response. 

No I'm not, I said if you talk **like** an Utashe member, don't be surprised to be called up on it. 

&gt;If you blame me for war crimes or extremism I did not commit or have any relation to whatsoever just based on my ethnicity you are one massive bigot mate and should look one good look of yourself in the mirror. 

Nah I'm just highlighting your hypocrisy of trying to showcase some sort of Croat moral highground when in fact it's not the case. 

&gt;And what have I done to you or have said that you decide I'm unworthy of your country? And what makes you think it's on you to chose who gets to come to your country if it's all legal?

Because you accused me of being a Brexiteer and hating on brown people, I think that's good enough reason for not wanting **you** (Not Croats in general) Specifically to come here. 

&gt;And here's that good old anglo chauvinism. Us eastern pigs should be glad to get any money from you holy beings. I'm not in the tourist business so why should I care about the money, I just know that the locals I've talked to on holiday that the English are by far the worst in behaviour.

Good, must irritate you that the very people you complain about helped you get independence. Long may it continue. 

&gt;Also I'm sure you'd call Thatcher Ustaše as well because she supported Tuđman and his army.

Nice try lol. And I quote;

""She continued to support Croatia in public until 1993 Ahmići massacre because, as she wrote in her book Statecraft, ""massacre in Ahmići convinced me that Croatia interpreted my visit to Zagreb as a signal that the world will turn a blind eye to such (Croatian) [barbarism.""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia%E2%80%93United_Kingdom_relations)

&gt;Only nation that actually gave any military assistance were the Americans and even that was purely tactical. 

Operation Grapple was the codeword used to cover UK defence operations in support of the UN peacekeeping missions in the former Yugoslavia (authorised by UNSCR 776 of September 1992);[1] **including the deployment of British forces in Bosnia and Croatia from October 1992 until December 1995 as part of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR).**

The UK agreed to join the UN force to protect humanitarian convoys in Bosnia, as part of UNPROFOR 2. **The first British Battalion (BRITBAT) was the Cheshire Regiment which deployed with its armoured vehicles in October 1992 through the Croatian port of Split** 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Grapple_(Yugoslavia)

&gt;Yes, teach me about my country's history more you mighty westerner. Would you like a whip to beat me with as well?

I'm just pointing out the ignorance of your own history. 

&gt;Again what does this have to do with me? Other than your prejudice? 

Ah right, but when you imply I'm a Brexiteer and don't want all those brown people in the UK, that's ok.

A better estimation is that given the economy starts up again in June, with few to none foreign arrivals, it will be between -4.4% and -12.4% recession with a good estimate being a -7.7%.   


But here's the thing: All of these seem way higher than governments and financial institutions have predicted so far. Maybe because the Spanish Flu returned in the winter months and became even more widespread and deadly. We don't know if that happens in our case, and should this happen, -10% could actually be a really low estimate unfortunately. As are all of the above.  


I think the worst thing this country does economically is place bets in stupid industries such as Agriculture, Tourism etc. I'll give you an example. Since 2000, HellasSat, a single company operating just 3 satellites, that is entirely privately funded, has brought in more into the public coffers than all olive producers in the country combined. Could you imagine what our economy would be like if they and companies like them were the ones receiving the BILLIONS of euros in EU and National subsidies instead of olive growers? We need to radically rethink our economic pie. The only real industry of Greece is shipping and this shouldn't be the case any longer. /Rant over

&gt;And what you don't understand is that we need to devalue our currency in order to be competitive

Oh, I've ""understood"" the miracle of devaluing your currency for a long time already. And the near obsessive belief that structural devaluation is a positive/normal thing for a developed economy which comes along with it. Italian debt problems are a consequence of 80's policies of some of their parties, not the 2002 euro introduction. That is just a useful scapegoat. Using devaluation to cover up fundamental issues will always end badly in the long run. As it does for most countries trying this, euro or not.

Many really underestimate what devaluing a currency does to an economy and society. It is far from a guaranteed succes story as some make it out to be and always wipes away things like pensions because of linked inflation. 

If you complain that austerity hurt the population yet don't mind devaluation does the exact same thing you are just being a hypocrite. 

There is however one thing I will agree with you upon:

&gt;we will see if we were actually doing better or not with the euro.

But until then you have little basis to proclaim Spain would be ""number 1 superpower extraordinair"" if the Peseta returned.

3226,"It mostly tracks back to supply and demand. If a country exports a lot then that means their currency increases in value. If a country imports a lot then that means their currency loses value. 

Say, I want to import something from the US - I need dollars to pay for that. This means that I'll try to buy dollars for my euros. This decreases the supply of dollars that are available for euros and thus makes dollars worth more compared to euros. (And euros less when compared to dollars.)

The way this affects the economy is that when a currency is going down in value, then what you produce becomes cheaper when measured in other currencies. Ie if I'm an American and want to buy something that costs 500 euros. It's cheaper for me to buy this if I have to pay 100 dollars for every 100 euros compared to 100 dollars for every 80 euros. This makes the exports of a country more competitive in terms of price. The opposite effect is also true. If your currency is going up in value, then your goods become more expensive.

These two together essentially mean that when a country exports a lot the value of their currency increases and this will decrease their exports. Other countries will be more easily able to compete. However, the issue with the euro is that it comprises of many different countries. If Germany exports a lot then this increases the value of the euro, but this gets counteracted by some other eurozone countries importing a lot. This benefits certain countries (like Germany) because it keeps their products more competitive. At the same time, the countries that import a lot will have an easier time importing, but it also means that it'll be harder for them to compete in exports as the price they can charge is higher than it would be otherwise.

""While the 150-page analysis does not cite the Italian government by name in compliance with the conditions on which the information was obtained by the author, the country's identity was confirmed by financial sources.""

""An expert in public debt management, Mr Piga suggests the unnamed government was able to mislead European Union institutions and administrations, as well as its own citizens, about the size of its budget deficit.""

""It was able to do this by entering into a secret transaction with a private, unnamed financial institution which allowed it to defer the interest payments on its public debt during 1996 and 1997. These were arguably the two most critical years of the euro entry process when one of the criteria set out in the Maastricht treaty required governments to keep their budget deficit to GDP ratio at or below 3%.""

Call it what you like it was a plan to hide and deceive the EU. And where am I mounting a case against Italy. The only thing I did was summing up different point that kept Italy from gaining more success before the Euro and after the Introduction of the Euro. That Italy as well benefited from the Euro was well seen in the article I linked. Has it profited in ways other countries profited? No, it did not. 

And here you seem to have some problem understanding my arguments. I am far from hoping of acceptance.

I think there is no difference in the people between Italy and the Netherlands or people from Spain or people from Germany.

So why do you think are there so big differences in Economical success? Well partly you already answered your opinion in this, it was the one single word you wrote in uppercase ""Germany wanted Italy in the Euro becauce it BENEFITS from it"". This is your solution. Everything else peanuts.

Coming back to my comparison of the people in the different countries. They are the same. The difference? Different style of politics and different style of politicians. And this means a lot. Just look over the big pond right now. This is an extreme.

There was a time Germany was called ""the old man of Europe"". Did it go to other countries asking for money but under Germanies conditions? Calling other countries names, asking Italy ""Italy do you remember Facism, Mussolini?  I know you dont. But you got a obligation to help""

This is what Germans read the other way around in advertisings in their newspapers paid by Italian politicians. Do you think the tirades of Salvini aren't heard here. Do you think the brainfarts of Tullio Solenghi weren't published?

Germany underwent harsh, hard reforms in social benefits, social security, labour costs etc.

Once again, telling that Germany profited the most, so it has to pay the most. Well it does already. Now it also has to stand liabel in common bonds for all future.

It sounds as if this success was intrinsic to the introduction of the Euro, but it is not. The success only came with reforms that made Germany competitive.

Do you think Italy is competitive? If not, do you think this would change with common bonds and no obligations to change? 

If the Euro is such a big obstacle for Italian competiviness why did Italy wanted to be in the Euro-zone this much? Was it because of the high inflation?

So the fault of Germany is that it is more competitive than Italy... and it tricked Italy into the Eurozone so it can suck all the money out of it.

&gt;USSR liberated Auschwitz and other camps, and won a war

I am perfectly aware of it. Might just as also add to it little details. Firstly, well no surprise Red Army liberated camps (or what was left of them), given that camps were almost only present in eastern side of Europe. Expecting Western Allies to liberate them makes as much sense as expecting Soviet to storm the beaches of Normandy or land on Iwo Jima. 

Secondly, might just as well add that war which they won was in great part started by them in the first place. First by giving Nazis green light with starting the war in form of Molotov-Ribbentrop pact, which was followed by significant economical support of Nazi war machine in 1939-1941 period while Germany was denied of such from rest of the world by British naval blockade. 

Such little details which you obviously won't hear from Russian sponsored news just like you won't hear from Chinese about Tiananmen square massacre or in USA regarding US involvement in Syria. All because it hurts theirs' pride and legitimacy.

3353,"It is not that simple. Public debt was often accumulated to pay for consumption, either for paying wages or pensions or social benefits or healthcare. Those can be important, but they are not 'productive'. When companies for example accumulate debt, it's generally for investments, they are supposed to make more money doing so afterwards, enough to pay interest and repay the principal.

With households, it varies. If you accumulate debt to buy a house, that can be pretty productive in a sense, because you won't have to pay rent every month. So paying a mortgage is like paying rent, but one accumulates in the private debt (mortgage) and others don't (rent). But if it is creditcard debt, that is generally used for consumption goods, which are not going to make you any money in the long run, so that is bad.

Then there is the difference in what happens when debt goes bad. Private debt is spread over millions of people. It is not very concentrated. Which means that if 1 guy goes bankrupt, the system doesn't care. A lot of people need to go bankrupt for the system to start to break. Public debt is more difficult to restructure because it is so concentrated. And because the interest levels of say company debt can be linked to the interest rate on national debt. If a country goes bankrupt, big companies can get into problems with their borrowing as well.

3535,"&gt;Italy had been reducing debt for years before 2008 and after they got hit hard, they were managing to keep their finances in check.

Sorry but this is not true by my standards. 

The root of the problem of Italy's public finances is a massive debt at ~130% of 2019 GDP, most of it built in the 80ies and 2008 crisis. Logically, adding more debt will make that problem bigger in the long term.

Italy has had decades to fix the debt problems from the 80ies but elected not to do so, running a deficit for every single year in the past 25 years. Granted, they were actually on track to do decently well until they elected Berlusconi. The same was true with Renzi, before electing the clowns from Lega and the five-star movement.

If Italy wants other countries to underwrite additional debts it needs to present a credible plan to bring debt to GDP in check. Be that a credible plan for growth, a reduction in spending, or both. 

The same is needed to keep the trust of the financial markets by the way.

edit: just to add a source, see the debt-to-gdp ratios of Italy over the past 25 years.

3545,"I'm at work and its been many years since I studied this - so I don't have time to dig up a full source (although I would be interested if you stumble on any). 

That said, for a good example of this, Józef Mehoffer was the son of Austrian officials who became polonised. There's a museum of in his house in Kraków, which I think belonged to his parents as well. 

I should have clarified that this was a generational phenomenon, it was unlikely that an Austrian official who had studied for most of their lives in Vienna or Graz would themselves become polonised, but because Austrian postings were typically life-long (or exceptionally long), their children would be brought up in the locale and culture. In Galicia's case, because Austria let the Polish aristocracy remain in place, this meant that the local elite culture there was heavily conducted in Polish (as opposed to Bohemia where urban centres were German-dominated until the late 1860s). 

This was also a two-way phenomenon, where Polish elites and aristocrats became 'Austrianised', e.g. Count Gołuchowski who became Foreign Minister of Austria-Hungary, and Counts Kasimir Badeni &amp; Alfred Potocki who became Minister-Presidents of Austria-Hungary.

As I say, Austria was pretty good for Poles (if you were an elite).

Edit: I can't find it on Amazon unfortunately - but [this was a reasonably good recent book](https://www.waterstones.com/book/the-habsburg-empire/pieter-m-judson/9780674986763) on the Austrian Empire. Take it with a pinch of salt as it is quite starry-eyed. But thats probably necessary for dealing with Austria. Bear in mind that anything published and/or patronised before 1989 all the way to 1918 about Austria-Hungary in German, Polish, Czech, Ukrainian, Hungarian etc. would likely have been written either by nationalists (who had an interest in denigrating A-H as backwards/despotic towards the empire's minorities) or socialists and communists (who had an interest in portraying it as economically moribund).

It's literally fake news.

Why is it so hard to at the very least accept that some news is outright fake and ideally call it out, instead of excusing it or defending it, despite it serving political interests you might agree with? 

Also it is not only TRT, but all over the Turkish news. Worst of all, it is also outside of news channels, in social media and here on reddit, in in r/Turkey and even here in /r/europe, propagated not only by a few but many users, very few Turkish users have spoken up, and they have been down voted heavily.

Ankara is not for everyone but if you love it, you fucking love it. It is not flashy, it is not interesting but it's calm, easy-to-live-in, peaceful. I love Ankara so much that locals sometimes get offended because they assume I'm fucking with them lol.

The problem is the understanding or the thinking that because a country does well and introduced reforms it is responsible for countries that did not adjust to the markets.   


Germany reformed its wellfare state and its labour relations in every point, with alot of hurt and pain for the common worker, to make germany and german products competitive on the markets.   
So german workers should not just accept all the hard reforms of the past the payed for with income  but also pay for countries that did not do this?  
Monetary transfers till all countries benefit the same financially regardless of the input?

The fact that they didn't really try tells me that they didn't need the manufactories to increase the output. What they needed was the huge new market the eastern block meant at that time. 

 I only beleive this because it makes sense. This is how capitalism works. The only problem was that people at the time from the eastern block didn't know this.

3928,"\&gt; One of the reasons for that, after the initial problems of getting enough tests, is that now so few people qualify to be tested.  

Exactly the problem in Latvia. Not neccessary because of 'measures too succesful' (well, it is that in part, of course, thankfully), but GPs (PCPs or what have you) who are now allowed to send people to get tested are for some reason reluctant to do so, so government is planning to do more persuasion campaigns this week to get GPs to start sending people to get tested as otherwise the labs are currently sitting at about 1/3rd of capacity.

 Allowing people to just go in for testing because they feel like it doesn't make much sense as, you'd end up with mostly worried well -  way things are right now, even most people who fit testing criteria turn out to be negative anyway - so the idea was to have that first sieve of doctors who do the sieving (in addition to testing all known contacts, people who've arrived from abroad and have at least minimum symptoms, testing all front line workers, patients in nursing homes etc).

Now our economy completely rely on Germany doing well and if they would for some reason collapse or get into a serious recession we will fall with them. Same could happen with China. Dependence.

4027,"From ten years ago, Hudson describes the problem with the ECB, how everyone else with a central bank can use it to finance spending without having to tax first necessarily. If you really don;t know this, you need to. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uI_7GFWQx0E

I claim it would be a mere political decision for the EU to use the ECB for good, rather than trying to fight an economic fight with one hand tied behind it's back. Everyone else with a central bank and its own currency, can use money creation to fund government projects and handle emergencies.

But it is worse than that, because the dream of the EU has simply become a neo-fuedal project, pushing southern countries into debt servitude with no hope of recovery. So you have to choose - delete massive amounts of debt, or face EU disintegration, or agree to change ECB rules so monetary policy can be used to handle these health and financial crises.

This is a very useful summary of the present EU economic nightmare.

I assume that some of the surveillance work is done via cultural attaches, at least in cities where there is a Chinese embassy or consulate, in order to minimize investigations and visa issues.

Well countries aren't an equally dark shade of grey either...

&gt;but I don't support China, that's a strawman you made yourself because you're losing the argument.

I didn't lose anything as you clearly support them, otherwise you wouldn't have started this tirade...

&gt;China doesn't control the WHO, that is absurd. 

China has a disproportionately strong grip on WHO, it doesn't necessarily need to flat out control it.

&gt;ONLY 14 COUNTRIES RECOGNISE TAIWAN. Your own country doesn't. Are everyone else Chinese shills too? Jesus Christ... It is the status quo, it's international law. The UN and 90% of its members don't recognize Taiwan.

I don't remember having questioning it.

&gt;clearly you don't care about facts considering you believe in conspiracy theories about the WHO.

What conspiracy theories?

&gt;I knew you'd say that, because you're biased.

Again, people not understanding important nuances are the first ones to call out hypocrisy.

&gt;Taiwan in its current state only exists because of the US and has been its puppet for a long time.

Taiwan is a democratic state, not a US puppet... Jesus, who's with the conspiracy theories again?

&gt;Once again you're being a hypocrite. 

I told you once before.

&gt;Taiwan needs recognition because they're a country but those others don't?

Others are literally puppet states of Russia.

&gt;When America makes countries continue existing like Taiwan its good but when Russia does it it's bad? 

Taiwan has a democratic government that stands against the Chinese totalitarian dictatorship on the mainland.

&gt;these are double standards.

I told you once before.

&gt;you either support the right of self determination universally or follow UN policy aka international law.

I do follow international law on this, but I also support democracy. You are mistaken if you think all nominally independent states without much recognition have an equal right for self-determination, it just isn't so. And not all of them are equally independent as the three you mentioned are literally Russian puppet states and the whole world considers them as such. Half the world recognizes Kosovo and while few recognize the Republic of China due to the Chinese economy being so important, they still try to maintain economic and cultural relations with Taiwan, as it is a democratic state as well.

&gt;Supporting Taiwan but not Abkhazia makes you a hypocrite.

4130,"I wasn't commenting on FPTP. I was commenting on your statement that ""majority can decide what happens"" is what democracy is, which is a common yet dangerous misunderstanding. I was not the person you were arguing against relating to FPTP. I have some issues with FPTP (I don't think an electoral system is fair when it results in such high percentages of wasted ballots), but that's a completely different situation and not what I'm arguing about.

&gt; To be a part of the EU is not a right.

Joining the EU is not a right, indeed. I would hold the position that a 52/48 vote *for* joining the EU should also be handled the same way as for a 52/48 Brexit referendum, i.e. wait until there is broader support. But the referendum passed with over 2/3rds majority, so what is your point? Sure, joining the EU is not a right, *but the vote was not about joining the EU, so that matters exactly ZERO*. Why are you strawmanning?

Nevertheless, ou forget one simple thing: Due to the simple and unavoidable fact that EU law affords rights to citizens of member states, leaving the EU *is* taking away rights. And some may say this one of the points of Brexit - to remove rights from a minority, such as the right of freedom of movement, the right of family reunification, the right to appeal against the government at the ECJ, the right for EU citizens to stand for local elections, the right of prisoners to vote. I could go on and on. All of these are rights afforded to EU citizens (*including* UK citizens) by EU law, but not under UK law, and all of them were heavily discussed during the referendum campaign. Most of them will disappear after the end of the transition period.

How many rights does waiting until there's a broader consensus either way take from the 52% who voted for Brexit? Other than the ""right"" to impose their will on a segment of the population of almost equal size to them?

&gt; That creates a tyranny of the minority, who could block anything that would benefit the majority.

No. A tyranny of the minority would be the minority being able to make decisions and impose them on the majority. For example, a system that refuses to afford rights to a very large part of the population (think Apartheid). This is not the case when you give a (large) minority veto power. By definition, veto power prevents action without a broad consensus - it does not prevent inaction.

And do not forget, a minority is obviously at more danger of being stepped on than a majority due to the sole fact that it is a minority, so it makes sense to afford it more protections than the majority. 50%+1 should not be able to vote to rob the other 50%-1 of their rights, just *because* they are a majority and the others a minority - that is completely ridiculous.

&gt; Therefore it's not a basic right of the minority. If it's not that urgent, why not let the majority decide?

I don't understand how you think this argument makes sense, and I'm not sure why I'm even investing the time to explain something this obvious to someone who thinks this is a good argument.

Staying in the EU is easily undoable. Leaving the EU is not easily undoable. Leaving can wait. But leaving makes rejoining almost impossible (especially in the same conditions as before). It has very immediate, permanent effects.

It's like someone appealing in court. The appeals court will stay the lower court's judgement, in order to prevent the judgment from being undoable. For example, if the lower court's judgment was that the government (or company, or whoever else) has to release document X, the appeals court declares a stay of that order because once the document is released, it cannot be ""unreleased"". The status quo stays, releasing the document can wait until everyone is sure it is the correct judgement.

Again, keeping the status quo *too long* is always fairer than changing the status quo, as the impact of the change is always higher than the impact of not doing anything. Especially when the status quo passed with a 2/3rds majority, and removing the status quo was basically a coin toss and could easily have been different if the vote had been held any other day of the same week.

The entire point of a democracy is to *deliberate*, such that measures pass with significant support. Democracy is slow *on purpose*. For anything urgent, it has means to bypass the deliberative phase (such as with emergency legislation). It should be slow otherwise, and it should be *especially slow* when it's something as large as a complete overturn of constitutional law. Anything else is hard to call a democracy.

That you don't understand these concepts - i.e. think democracy is a synonym of ochlocracy, and that a tyranny of the minority means requiring a supermajority for constitutional changes - makes me doubt the effectiveness of the civics classes where/when you attended school.",Portugal,/r/europe/comments/g0oln5/anticorbyn_labour_officials_worked_to_lose/fnc5aw8/,LordGravewish,1586828926

Imagine that a large industrial firm had to choose between access to the Chinese supply chain or continuing to do research in an area (such as AI) that China wanted for itself- it’s easy to see China forcing existing firms away from developing new technologies in the long term by threatening to force them out of business in the present. 

If China can use a business as political leverage, it is only a matter of time until it does.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/g0r5fl/european_countries_need_to_protect_their/fnc8k6l/,Kahzootoh,1586830946

In Germany? When was that supposed to be?

Contrary to the UK with its high unity among all voters.

&gt; Do you think the UK is a hellhole?

For ordinary folk? On its way.

&gt; You've had GroKo for eleven of the last fifteen years and clearly no one is happy.

How do you even know how no one is happy?  
Throughout that time Merkel has been one of the most popular politicians and currently she's gaining much sympathy.

I don't like her, her policies, party or ideology. And yet when I look at the UK I'd rather have 20 years more grand coalition than one year Tory rule.

For the last thousand years we were going different ways living in two different worlds and we were one country just for 74 years (except the IIWW). We have different historical experiences - while Czechs lived in the Austrian part of the history and culture, Slovaks lived in the Hungarian part. The differences: 

\- religion: Czechs are the most atheist country in the world, while Slovaks are catholics and very religious,  
\- national politics: Czechs were quite emancipated in the Austrian Kingdom, while Slovaks were under the pressure of magyarization,  
\- politics: Czechs had their politicians in the Diet, while Slovak politicians in Hungarian Kingdom were oppressed, also Slovaks prefer an authority (big leader) in politics, while Czechs don't,  
\- inheritance: in Austria and Czechia it was the oldest son who inhereted the property of the family, so it stayed big, while in Hungaria and Slovakia all the children inherited the property, so they had to divide it and it was getting smaller and smaller - poorer people who couldn't become what they wanted to be, they all had to stay and take care of the land, while Czechs could go study or learn another trade,  
\- education: Czechs had a big and important university, when Slovaks in Hungarian Kingdom couldn't even study in their own language - even in the primary schools,  
\- society: Czechs had it's own kings and later a lot of intellectuals, while Slovaks were mostly poor farmers,  
\- country: Czechs were centrists and wanted one centrist federation, while Slovaks wanted a confederation.

Czechoslovakia was created because of pragmatical reasons and it was based on an artificial idea of the non-existent czechoslovakism. Without it, it would be difficult to be recognized by the great powers.

4205,"No, exiting the EU is equivalent to a constitutional change, since EU law has primacy to national law, it has by treaty equivalent status to constitutional law, and guarantees a bunch of rights that national law doesn't. Have you never heard a single complaint about the ""fascist ECJ imposing things on the UK""? That's exactly why - the ECJ was ruling that e.g. EU citizens have the right to family unification under EU law, while in UK national law that right does not exist. Leaving the EU also has significant implications to those that make use of their EU citizenship, since that status and corresponding rights are being taken away from them.

The majority does *not* have the right to remove rights from the minority. That is the entire point of having a liberal democracy. What you're describing is an Ochlocracy, i.e. a tyranny of the majority / tyranny of the masses. Any significant change to the status quo should require a convincing supermajority, to avoid exactly this. 50%+1 should not be allowed to vote to rob/torture/kill the other 50%-1 of the population. Same as they shouldn't be allowed to change what is essentially constitutional law.

While having a higher threshold does not completely insure against a tyrannical majority, it significantly increases the difficulty of doing so by requiring a much broader support base. Essentially, it prevents 50%+1 from voting against the 50%-1's interests, by requiring it to be 2/3rds+1 against 1/3rd-1.

And yes, the status quo is exactly what should be kept until there is a convincing majority either way. We shouldn't be making extremely important decisions based on a coin toss, and when you have such small margins, *it is well studied that even just changing the weekday the vote is held on can affect the result*, due to e.g. making some people able/unable to vote.

Leaving the EU isn't something that *had* to happen this January or the UK ceases to be. It's not a matter of life or death. It is something that can wait for a convincing majority either way. The referendum to join the EU in 1975 had a 2/3rds supermajority for joining. There's no reason why leaving it shouldn't require at least something *close* to that, other than it being your desired result.",Portugal,/r/europe/comments/g0oln5/anticorbyn_labour_officials_worked_to_lose/fnbqzmd/,LordGravewish,1586820595

4290,"I don't think it's weird that the Human development index compares life expectancy within gender rather than within the whole population. When stripping away all external factors men and women, with modern medicine, tend to have different life expectancy due to f.e. the protective effects of estrogen on cardiovascular diseases (a huge killer for older people). 

I would really agree with you that in developed countries it doesn't make sense to use this for the GDI though. Developed countries could have found better ways of treating cardiovascular disease or other biological factors, and therefore a smaller difference in life expectancy doesn't mean women are dying faster than they are supposed to. When a country has solved the biological factor of childbirth mortality and women die less often it doesn't mean that men started dying more than they were supposed to. So this measure might be good for pointing out some forms of gender inequality (like in russia the difference is so big partly because men are more affected by alcohol/drug abuse epidemic there, so there are clearly some unequal factors) but for denmark I don't think it's fair to use. 

By the way even when using this measure on this specific factor russia does come out as worse, because the difference in russia is 11 years (6 away from the expected 5 years) while the difference in denmark is 4 (only 1 away from the expected 5 years) (yes i know your post was sarcastic). That goes to show that the GDI doesn't make sense to use as it includes different factors. In theory the HDI inequality on one factor could be canceled by a HDI inequality on another factor that goes the other way. So a country with perfect GDI could just be 'equally inequal'",,/r/europe/comments/g0lshp/life_expectancies_in_europe/fnbc5dd/,blizzardspider,1586812922

anti-Chinese agenda based on fake news and benefitting America's and the far right's interests is bad yes. the world is not black and white. China bad yes but not always. America bad but not always.

&gt; I am criticizing the side you choose to support...

but I don't support China, that's  a strawman you made yourself because you're losing the argument.

&gt;Failing to answer due to being controlled by the Chinese is another thing.

yikes a conspiracy theory not based on facts but on fake news. China doesn't control the WHO, that is absurd. They're not even a major financial contributor. Fucking Bill Gates gives more funding to the WHO than China. what's next? 5G causes Coronavirus and the Jews are gonna impose the NWO?

&gt;Essentially only pro-Chinese people don't agree with that political agenda.

ONLY 14 COUNTRIES RECOGNISE TAIWAN. Your own country doesn't. Are everyone else Chinese shills too? Jesus Christ... It is the status quo, it's international law. The UN and 90% of its members don't recognize Taiwan.

&gt;Yes, I adhere to facts and support the democratic world over that of hostile dictatorships.

clearly you don't care about facts considering you believe in conspiracy theories about the WHO. 

&gt;Because they are Russian puppet states.

I knew you'd say that, because you're biased. Taiwan in its current state only exists because of the US and has been its puppet for a long time. Once again you're being a hypocrite. Taiwan needs recognition because they're a country but those others don't? When America makes countries continue existing like Taiwan its good but when  Russia does it it's bad? hmmmmm. these are double standards. you either support the right of self determination universally or follow UN policy aka international law. Supporting Taiwan but not Abkhazia makes you a hypocrite.

4508,"I can't speak for the italians, but as I am spanish, I'll try to summarise our situation as best as I can. Keep in mind I am no expert, and this is a very brief overview that lacks on depth.

Rajoy's government (eight years in office) favoured the companies. Gave a lot of freedom for indiscriminated firings, without the companies having to pay them or honour their contracts.Stole from public savings. Paid in B. Unrepentantly so. Signed and got passed a few laws that diminished taxes for business, foregoing the social benefits. Precarity took a hold: you're a lucky person if you manage to sign a contract that lasts three months \*and\* gives you the option to resign it for another three months. It's cheaper for the business and they don't have to pay you in full, since they would be 'training you', even if you can prove you have +5 years of experience. 

His time in office happened after what we call 'el boom del ladrillo' or a construction bubble bursting. The market was in shambles, after having being heavily based on construction and tourism-related buildings, and we do not have a strong, self reliable economy. Tourist season helps a lot of people as you can easily get a temporal contract somewhere in the industry. But they are never well compensated, extra hours are never recorded and therefore they do not count towards taxes (even if the inspectors try their best), and since there are a lot of people looking for jobs, they abuse their power, and use the competitive market against the people looking for a job (there will always be someone more desperate than you, that will take the job for much less pay than you, etc).

And we do have farming land and production, but it's hard work with less than good pay off, so not everybody wants to work there unless it's already established. There are not many laws that protect spanish-made products or produces, or farmed vegetables, or olive oil. It's getting better, but not fast enough.

Also, as a side note, most people from my generation (30 years old and under), and those who come after us, are choosing simply getting jobs elsewhere in the UE, effectively migrating, but without sending money back - so without the benefit of 'injecting' money back home.",,/r/europe/comments/g0moyt/why_do_countries_like_spain_and_italy_have_high/fnaju0t/,MistressVoid,1586798748

That   corruption, nepotism, tax fraud, debt overload and a dysfunctional public administration were part of the problem that caused Greece to reach the tipping point? 

I do not think someone can argue against it. That is true,but pretending to be the only reasons i think its not accurate.

Austerity is not a propaganda term if that is what you are saying,it is the reality in Greece for the last 10 years and according to EU officials they admit themselves that the way they handled Greece's economic adjustment program might have been too harsh borderline inhumane and not so efficient.The effects of austerity were clearly underestimated.

'' But on its own, this will solve nothing. ''

Extreme austerity on its own wont solve anything either. 10 years,reached every single goal troika gave,followed it to the core especially last 4 years. 

What you fail to understand that alot of the things you described stem from austerity as well,and unless you find balance problems will keep re-appearing. 

Brain drain was an example,how can a country hope to compete with others in technology for example when majority of its youth scientists and skilled individuals go abroad and have no incentive to stay.

Most of the Billions that were thrown at Greece did not reach the People actually,what is happening is basically keeping someone barely alive so he can keep paying your interest....in the long run this wont benefit anyone. 

Finding balance on how to spend the money that were lent to greece is what was needed and Troika failed to do it.

Where countries running large current account deficits would be chastised for doing so, as it hurt their competitiveness. But that was not good enough. That was too much of a stigma. So they made it that having a 'too high' current account surplus was bad too. Because Germany was too fucking competitive, they wanted to make sure Germany was dragged down to their level.

It's showing an area that is that old.

&gt; It actually illustrates perfectly the ribbon shaped urbanism your Dutch compatriot was talking about in Belgium.

It really doesn't. To start with, ""ribbon development"" refers to the practice of lining every road in an area with housing; you see this particularly clearly in rural areas where there's these ""ribbons"" of development along rural roads, that are clearly haphazardly planned. 

Meanwhile, while it may look superficially similar to you, Almere Haven was actually meticulously planned. It doesn't even really *look* like a ribbon area.

4794,"&gt;I'm curious: which more important things do you hint at?

The existing economy.

Legislating is a lot more than a  ""stroke of a pen"" or a ""quick win"". No government would go close to legalising cannabis without a full medical board review, for the foreseeable future I imagine those boards will be a bit preoccupied with their own more important fights. Next we have the government itself, again legislation, how much time do they spend analysing, discussing and debating on regulating the cannabis industry; advertising laws, outlets, distribution networks, local planning permissions, taxations, enforcement laws and council jurisdictions .... all of this needs to be meticulously planned and passed through law. This takes months if not years of parliamentary and civil services time, requiring thousands of man hours and thousands of pages of documentation.

..... and meanwhile who is discussing the bailouts? the stimulus packages? the reformation of the medical sector? the education sector?  the general clean up of the entire economy that itself will need a tonne of new legislation passed just to get it functioning again.  

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Your valid point does not deny the fact that legalizing cannabis, if well executed, has the potential to redirect billions of euros to society. 

It validates that this is not the time to be doing it. Put it at the back of the queue.

Any cannabis industry will be a drop in the ocean compared to the manufacturing, retail, automotive, airline, services,  etc...

4836,"As you said there is not a limit, but the limit is included in the budget approved by European Commission annually.

Italian deficit would dramatically decrease with Eurobonds, because Italy is running from 30 years on primary surplus, so it’s doing new debt only to pay old interest rates. All Italian deficit is financing old interest rates, while the national expenditure is TOTALLY covered by tax income!

Basically, if it keeps on doing so, in the first years Italy should continue to emit a lot of debt, for paying the old interest rates, but when the moment to pay the new interests on Eurobonds will come, Italy will find itself on total surplus so the total debt will decrease and above all there will be need of a lot less new debt to emit. 

Even if Italy decided to not run anymore on primary surplus, it still have to be compliant with European rules on budget, which determine a limit to the debt. Moreover EC imposed to Italy to reach the balanced total budget amendment in 2023 and Italy is doing so.

Maybe with the coronavirus crisis, the deadline will be postponed. But in these rules there is an evident limit for new debt, which cannot be infinite. 


Moreover, I want to make clear another point: Italy has no interest in declaring bankrupt “because others pay its new debt”. The safety is for investors, not for Italy. For Italy it’s not different declaring bankrupt today or with Eurobonds, it would be the same catastrophe for the nation. It would be instead different for investors, which now could not be paid, while with Eurobonds they would be still paid. 

But Italy has no interest in ruining even more its economy and declaring bankrupt. A bankrupt is a bankrupt, you delete your debt. Both with national bond or with Eurobonds.

4838,"Since no one provided an actual answer...

Poland did have the possibility to vote by post, although relatively few people used it — mostly disabled people and some expats. It was scrapped by the current government as they claimed it is prone to fraud. Now they not only want to reintroduce it on very short notice, but also massively expand to an extent that was never seen in Poland. Even if they were an extremely competent government I wouldn't expect this to work.

A second issue is that they introduced massive restrictions (and that in itself is mostly a good thing of course) which make campaigning essentially impossible. This makes the incumbent the only candidate who gets significant media exposure, so it's hard to consider this a fair election.

Finally there is the fact that the government did not declare a state of emergency. This is a state defined in our constitution and designed to balance the restrictions placed on the populace with additional restrictions on the power of the government, in particular postponing any elections. Instead they introduced all the restrictions needed to fight the pandemic, but none on their own power. This is not really a separate point, just a explanation that the second issue I pointed out has been foreseen and there is a standard way of resolving it.

If you think that voting power should be tied to the GDP, then why should colossal economies such as Germany, France or Italy (3.4, 2.4 and 1.8 Trillions of euros) have the same weight as almost irrelevant countries (economically speaking) such as Estonia (0.28) ?

If anything, if you (rightly) ignore per capita statistics, then even ""rich"" countries like Sweden and the Netherlands seem to be less ""important"".

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand,  if you go only by population, then big countries (which are also those with the biggest economy) should have even more MEPs. Some countries have an absurd number of MEPs per capita. Estonia has 4.6 MEPs per milion people, whereas countries like the UK/France/Germany/Italy only have 1.2. 

The point is to represent fairly small minorities and/or territories, in the same way you would do locally (e.g. voters in small provinces/regions usually have a somewhat higher individual voting power). However, I think that the increment in voting power is sometimes disproportional, Estonia is an extreme example.  But also Germany, which is the most populous country in the EU, has more MEPs per capita than the UK and France, and the same number as Italy and Spain (even though Germany has 83M citizens, whereas Spain only has 47M)",,/r/europe/comments/g0f2j7/the_eu_member_states_explained_in_a_pictogram/fn9lp3g/,problematico3,1586777654

4942,"Again, USA, UK or Japan prove otherwise. Yes high levels of debt can be problematic, but cutting spending to keep your budget in check, whilst in a crisis is even more problematic, since you're litteraly contracting the economy in times of crisis, which provokes less income which means less spending, and you enter a vicious cycle. If with a few years of expansive policies you're able to grow the economy or recuperate faster, that means you'll be able to repay your debt, if you're contracting your economy year after year, you're going to be trapped in a debt spiral. 

You have an ideological position, I have another one, but don't act as if your position is right and mine is wrong, they're both political, they can both work or they can both fail, especially since they depend on concrete policy implementation, but austerity and debt control are an ideological position that have been imposed by northern Europe to the whole of a union. And sure, Europe could let Greece default without too much worry (even though that created a bigger crisis for all of Europe) but if next time it's Spain, or Italy? Then it won't be (relatively) small crisis for the eurozone at large, but a huge shock for all of the euro.

"" In a booming economy, cutting taxes will foster growth, which in turn increases the tax base and thus the amount of taxes collected, even if it makes for a smaller share of GDP. ""

In a booming economy, cutting taxes leads to overheating and rising inflation. Rising inflation leads to higher interest rates, which eventually brings the economy to a recession. It also leads to asset bubbles, too fast wage growth, which are all imbalances that need to be fixed later.

In a booming economy, you increase taxes to prevent overheating and reduce the risk of out of control inflation, thus keeping growth going for longer. 

You seem in love with some kind of voodoo economics. That is no way to have a decent budgetary system as the Netherlands and Germany have proven. 

AND ITALY DOES NOT HAVE A BALANCED BUDGET. Do not buy the bullshit of people talking about the primary balance. Yes, it is relevant. BUT IT IS NOT A BALANCED BUDGET.

And Eurobonds now for the corona-expenditure will not lower its interest bill. It will just increase it by less. So the situation is STILL getting worse, not better. Unless you expect the Germans to put the entire Italian debt in Eurobonds and if you believe that will ever happen I have a bridge in Brooklyn to sell you.

- Our savings and pensions are being eroded fast because if the QE measures of the ECB (interest of almost zero). Reason for these measures: keeping Italy afloat. The Netherlands were against these measures, but were outvoted.

(Like here [https://www.google.com/maps/@52.7158078,5.7822829,2106m/data=!3m1!1e3](https://www.google.com/maps/@52.7158078,5.7822829,2106m/data=!3m1!1e3) , north solar panel 'parc', with all those rooftops just a bit to the south, there are probably good reasons to do this, but I still don't like them)

The amount companies pay for electricity in itself is troubling, only a couple of cents compared to the +-20 cts for normal consumers. While they've got massive roofs which can easily be plastered with solar panels. But it is not at all financially interesting for them to do so. Slowly starting to see this though.

There is one tiny problem othere though, a lot of those parcs are built in the less densely populated areas,  and sometimes more densely populated, but our power infrastructure can't handle the output of those turbines and panels.

[Regional seats of government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_seat_of_government#Last_phase_of_Cold_War) or RSGs were the best known aspect of British civil defence preparations against nuclear war. As it was clear that London could not survive a nuclear bombardment, and although considerable effort still went into secret construction of military citadels under the capital, the solution was to disperse the machinery of government into small pieces in the provinces, where there would be a greater chance of survival. It was then expected that central government might itself cease to exist, and control would pass entirely into the hands of a regional commissioner, of cabinet rank, who would wield absolute power in his region. His staff would replicate all parts of central government. They were completed between 1958 and 1961, and the construction was done in complete secrecy, with Parliament, as well as the public and the press, unaware of the work being carried out. The existence of the entire network was blown open in 1963, when a small group called Spies for Peace, acting on a tip-off, broke into RSG6 at Warren Row and, anonymously, produced a pamphlet exposing the network. They were never caught and the result was a political scandal, not dissimilar to the [Protect and Survive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yrv505R-0U) series [meltdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protect_and_Survive#Publication_of_the_pamphlet). Evidently, the government was spending large amounts of taxpayers' money to protect itself while doing nothing for the mass of the population who faced annihilation in a nuclear war. Investigations by other journalists uncovered and published the sites of most of the other bunkers in the network, and despite this being technically illegal, none were ever prosecuted. 

Here is a [long video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW5tiRb41sg) of today's Chilmark emergency national seat of government RSG7, decommissioned and sold in the 1990s after the end of the cold war. The bunker was leased in 2013 to three geniuses that got jailed for their part in running a vast [underground cannabis farm](https://i.redd.it/xu4fzltuzji31.jpg) staffed by four young Vietnamese workers who were held in slave-like conditions. Police found 4,400 plants, of which 643kg had to be incinerated, as electricity was siphoned off illegally from a nearby pylon to power hundreds of lights and fans. When the sentences were announced, anti-trafficking organisations said they were concerned that [slavery charges](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/aug/11/three-men-jailed-cannabis-factory-nuclear-bunker) against the three had been dropped. The trafficking victims were released without charge but police immediately contacted immigration officials and they were arrested for immigration offenses, three were subsequently deported.

5056,"&gt; the best approach would be to give the South meaningful economic support in return for meaningful reform and EU oversight

That could be great or terrible, depending on how you define ""meaningful reform"". A serious spending review would be extremely useful, and our governments might benefit from some external consulting, provided they suggest reasonable solutions. There is huge potential in Italy for both cutting wasteful expenses, recovering lost tax revenue, and increasing productivity. If EU oversight could help with those, then I'm sure a lot of Italians would be willing to give it a try. Mind you, I do not like the idea very much, but I understand that if you want something you have to be willing to give something in return. But it would definitely not work if the proposed measures were things like ""privatize healthcare"", ""cut education budget"", or ""increase age of retirement"", which at this point might as well mean ""work until you drop"".

In spite of what certain people think (incidentally, it's people who probably have never even been to Italy except on vacation) Italians are not allergic to work or hardship. Economically we have been stuck in an rut for over ten years, we still work as much as other major European nations, and we earn much less while having comparable living costs. We are not lavish spenders, and we can be far more careful with our money [than certain countries with massive household debts](https://data.oecd.org/hha/household-debt.htm#indicator-chart) that like to act all high and mighty and pretend they're in any position to teach us about frugality (Look who's number one in the Eurozone: hi, Netherlands!).

Countries with higher debt are unwilling to borrow more money to since it could either bankrupt them or would have them introduce austerities(cutting social programmes) to pay the debts.  

So those countries propose an Eurozone-wide bond (Eurobond), meaning the members of the Eurozone countries can borrow as a single entity and share the debt among the other Eurozone members.  

Countries with lower debt are against it because they believe it could lead to countries with higher debt borrowing money without much consequence, while increasing debt for those with less debt.  

Countries that are against Eurobonds say those that want to borrow moeny should do so through ESM(European Stability Mechanism) so they can borrow with some condition to ensure that they can pay them back.  

Those that want Eurobonds believe that a) more debt for them could lead the whole Eurozone to go into recession, so a common borrowing and debt should alliviate that and b) European solidarity is at stakes if the countries with more money doesn't help those with less, and could lead to the end of EU.",Greenland -> Denmark,/r/europe/comments/fzyqi6/countries_for_against_the_eurobonds/fn99c6v/,KetchupBlood,1586764091

&gt;
&gt;&gt;*That is why I gave you six more cases because this is not the first time someone came with that insane logic.* 
&gt;
&gt;Again, language please. The second Swedish case was, as you mentioned, on February the 26th which is far later. In Denmark we got our first confirmation on the 27th, but that was from a dude who landed on the 24th, so he would have been infective already from there. The fact that he was allowed to go around without being tested for several days after landing from Italy's epicenter kinda proves why you can't trust the numbers for confirmed cases.

So? The first case landend in Sweden 24th jan. This is nonsense. But I am happy you're sticking to hard evidence.

&gt;I've explained my reasons in the other comment. The shape of the graph looks like it started a bit earlier for us, but I don't reject that it can be interpreted in other ways and, besides, it wouldn't offset things by much. 
&gt;

Ah yes the ""shape"".





&gt;And when you change your argument so that it isn't a single elderly home that spiked the rate, but a bunch of them, then it isn't really a freak accident influencing statistics anymore. It is, quite possibly, a product of your corona response.


We put elderly homes in quarantine before Norway..... what else do you want? It got there as you said in a ""freak accident"". This was the worst thing that could happen and it happend. 


Speculation
My speculation is that since these homes have the same food provider (Sodexo). That might be the source.

&gt;I Sverige rekommenderade Folkhälsomyndigheten redan den 10 mars anhöriga från att genomföra ”onödiga besök” på äldreboenden och sjukhus och den 1 april beslutade regeringen att införa ett rent besöksförbud.

&gt;I Norge har olika kommuner vidtagit åtgärder vid olika tidpunkter. Till exempel beslutade Oslo kommun den 3 april att ”begränsa besök hos sårbara grupper” till bara de ”helt nödvändiga”. Fauske kommun öster om Bodö beslutade den 27 mars samma sak och i Haugesunds kommun norr om Stavanger togs ett liknande beslut den 17 mars och den 7 april skärptes detta till ett förbud som gällde hela landet.

Även om Sverige alltså var tidigt ute med att försöka stoppa besöken på äldreboendena lyckades man inte stoppa smittspridningen till de äldre.

&gt;&amp;#x200B;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;*Read what you wrote about Stockholm again. Do you understand?*
&gt;
&gt;No. Please explain your point to me.
&gt;

This is in reference to the fact that most death could be explained by the elderly homes and when you cut of sthlm it becomes apparent. Like when you compared Sweden (-sthlm) to Köpenhamn.

&gt;
&gt;&gt;**Btw it's amazing you're speculating in your original comment and demanding sources from mine** 
&gt;
&gt;I'm not doing either.

You said that the outbreaks started in Denmark and Norway which is not supported by anything. Not even by the ""shape"". 

&gt;
&gt;Dude, I made an excel sheet calculating numbers to see if you might have a point with that comment you now took back. I look at population data, passenger statistics, make excel sheets on death rates and read your sources. 


Your statistic supported the speculation that this high death rate could be explain by the elderly home infection rate in sthlm. If you don't take sthlm into account it becomes apparent why the death rate is so high.  Nothing changed, in regards to my earlier comment.

The reason, however, that I put nuclear in a separate category is that coal kills people much more slowly and ""specifically"", meaning each death from coal is much closer to the act of extracting or processing coal.

A single nuclear accident can kill hundreds of people immediately and cause horrific health problems for tens of thousands more. Given bad wind conditions, those numbers could grow insanely large. If there were no other option to stop climate change, that risk might be worth it.

But there are options. By expanding the use of wind, solar, hydro, and geothermal, while using natural gas to cover peak use, we can cover the world's energy use until fusion becomes mainstream.

\------

Btw. my point with removing Stockholm from the calculation is that it only got you down to our levels. However, if we removed Copenhagen too, then our numbers would fall drastically too. 

Regarding putting elderly in quarantine that still risks them if the rest of the population is more infected. One of my relations has a friend in the high risk zone. He does everything to avoid corona, but shit happens and sometimes you need to go to the hospital. I don't remember exactly what it was, but now he got corona. The higher the risk in general, the higher the risk will also be even in quarantined areas. 

This would also go for the food provider, you mentioned. If there's a bigger risk in society, there's also a bigger risk they will get it.

The point of my criticism is not to ""blame"", but rather to underline the unbelievable, mind-boggling hypocrisy of supporting a ""Union"" which is anything but, given that everyone thinks of their own country's interest and nothing else. You don't want to offer any kind of assistance that isn't in the form of a poisoned apple like the ESM? No objections from me, it is perfectly within your rights to act like that! But at least have the decency to drop the facade of ""solidarity"". Just come out and say ""We care more about our own"". Own it. Oh and, for the love of goodness, next time we get a wave of economic migrants, tell your PMs to show them the same kindness you showed us. I expect to see a lot less ""refugees welcome"" signs, and a lot more ""sorry, blame your own shitty governments!"", and I expect to hear Frau Merkel and Sanna Marin saying: ""Sorry, but helping you would cost us precious taxpayer money!"".

yeah, on Reddit because redditors are easily susceptible to propaganda.

&gt; Sure-sure..

another redditor who doesn't understand what the WHO and the UN are and doesn't understand basic geopolitics.

for the record, the WHO is a medical, scientific organisation, so it has to be neutral. This effectively means accepting the status quo. The status quo is that the People's Republic of China is officially recognised by international law as the legitimate government of China, official recognised by the UN and all but 14 of its members (mostly Carribean nations). Even countries hostile to PRC recognise it as legitimate over Taiwan/Republic of China.  
Secondly, the WHO is an organisation of the UN, so it in addition of being neutral and following the status quo, it has to follow UN policy which again does not recognise Taiwan.

The journalist was being an asshole by asking a leading political question to a scientific body in order to get a specific response. The doctor, being cornered, rightfully avoided the question. It is no different than ranting about Palestine and Israel to your local GP. The WHO don't recognise Abkhazia, South Ossetia, Transnistria, Artsakh and Kosovo. So in addtion to being CCP shills, are they Georgian, Moldovan, Azerbaijani and Serbian shills too? 🤣

Because of it's succes there's a food forests being planted in 2020-21 in Brabant that is 20 hectares!!! Designed in rows to enable easier picking and managing of the plants but still a food forest with it's principles, to show farmers how it can be done to make food and money efficiently! It's being done in cooperation with the provincial government, and a lot of participating parties signed an agreement to look for more places to erect food forests. It's a fantastic development, all started by Wouter van Eck and his Ketelbroek food forests back in 2010, he started it with his own money, purchasing just one hectare because of what he read on the internet, and his travels to Africa where there still is old forest and people living of the food it produces. Now a up and coming restaurant in the city where i live called De Nieuwe Winkel is using only ingredients from Ketelbroek and another biological garden, together with for example Japanese ways of cooking but also experimenting, to offer customers vegetarian dishes made from exotic fruits and vegetables that grow in Ketelbroek, that normally have to be flown in from Asia! The Restaurants owner, Emile van der Staak, works together with Wouter and his restaurant has recently been awarded a wordwide recongnised price for innovating restaurants that are sustainable and conscious about their ingredients. I'm not very into that world, but restaurants like that should be the ones awarded Michelin stars, but as i understand it's also a bit political comparable to the Oscars....

Yeah, people die. But few people die at birth anymore, and most kids last through childhood.

5483,"&gt;	will have absolutely no say over how Italy spends

This was false.
As I said all budgets are revised and approved by European Commission, so the debt can’t be done to the infinite without control. 

&gt;	Whether Italy had a primary surplus or not is completely irrelevant to that fact!

It is, because it means that also southern countries follow european common rules, while many people think they don’t. 

&gt;	That's why you conveniently begin the count in 2002.

Actually I did it because it was the first source I found. Italy still has primary surplus from 1990, but there wasn’t the Euro at that time. Should I really look for sources than converting it? Please, it’s boring. The primary surplus was always about 0,5%-1,5% of GDP in the ‘90.

Moreover, while I agree on structural problems of Italian economy, which are largely improved by ‘90s, I can’t agree on stagnation: Italian GDP until the crisis in 2008 was doing well! It used to grow between 1% and 3% annually. The crisis and the austerity caused the stagnation; Eurobonds would have saved Italy during the debt crisis and now we wouldn’t talk about stagnation! 


In fact, the main problem of Italy is interest rate on its debt. Running primary surpluses from 1990, but having an increasing debt, means that Italy is doing new debt only for paying old interest rates. 
Basically, if Italy keeps on with its primary surplus, but Eurobonds will guarantee for long times low interest rates, very soon Italy will be free by its crisis.

I mean: you are right that you don’t want to pay for error of others, and I wouldn’t trust a country which keeps to waste money!! But now, we are talking about a country which is virtuous and compliant to rules from about 30 years and it’s still paying the errors of ‘70-‘80s!
Maybe giving an help, making it free from its crisis, will give a boost also to the EU, considering that it’s the 3rd GDP of the EU (without UK).",Italy,/r/europe/comments/fzyqi6/countries_for_against_the_eurobonds/fn7s13i/,bion93,1586726466

The thing is that most infrastructure projects is supposed to help the local economy through contractors which allows the money to trickle back into the economy.

5534,"Obviously, if a fiscal union is achieved, the managing team would have to comprised of one member from each country of said union. 

I just don't think you know how much austerity has impacted the lives of millions of people in southern countries. The wages are substantially lower than the rest of the Eurozone (especially in Portugal, Spain and Greece) and meanwhile these countries are heavily taxed without reaping any benefits from the government (healthcare, education, infrastructure is bad compared with richer countries that are taxed way less).
I'm not saying this specifically about Denmark because I know they have heavy taxes but that allows you to have a country that runs smoothly and can even afford to, for example, pay students to study. That's unheard of in southern countries.

My point is, people live very differently throughout the EU. The richer countries can afford to have a population with higher wages and overall more quality of life. I agree southern governments have been incompetent and corruption is rampant but there isn't really any room for improvement and change if the austerity keeps going with the sole purpose of paying the countries' debt. A single market and currency is bound to fail if there is no fiscal union, the poorer won't have the chance to get back on their feet and the richer will just keep exporting their goods and profit. That's why the EU has cyclic catastrophic economic crisis. 
People in the south can be just as productive as the north. The countries only need some room to breath and good economic management that could definitely be provided by the EU.

Germany and other European countries will have to pay these 10bn only if Italy declares bankrupt someday.

Also, you say he used ""patters of the Kingdom of Navarre"", which sounds like utter bullshit to me, when Arana not only did NOT want it to represent Navarre: he wanted it to represent just Biscay and not all the Basque land.

He was apparently quite vocal with his complaints in this regard:

https://www.abc.es/historia/abci-verdad-sobre-origen-ikurrina-no-gusta-independentistas-vascos-201806262322_noticia.html

So, that thing about Navarre elements or whatever, doesn't sound right. He REFUSED that it became related to Navarres. Why would he follow it?

It looks a spitting image of the Union Jack. In fact, several sources do claim he copied the Union Jack, the country which was the 1st World Power at the time. See:

5658,"The problem with renewable is not actually production. It is already cheaper than common other production methods like burning coal or gas. 

The problem is that instantaneous power generation from renewable is something that is extremely hard to predict. Some “clean” energy generated by households is now thrown away because there’s no need for it at the moment and the grid needs to stay at 50Hz. Fossil fuel burning is a very stable and predictable generation method. 

The fact that you have water reservoirs available to store potential energy, makes it that other technologies like wind or solar can be used more because the grid can use the water buffer it has to make up for shortages and abundances of energy.

She also criticized the German government's decision that holidaymakers could only claim a credit note for canceled trips during the coronavirus crisis, and not a full refund. ""Throughout Europe, people have a legal choice as to whether they want the cash or a voucher,"" she insisted.

5762,"Denmark has never stopped reforming. I have grown up in a country that launch reforms every few years.
It increased its pension age so that 2030 it will have one of the highest retirement ages in Europe. 
Unemployment benefits was cut and the time you could receive it reduced from 4 to 2 years.

Denmark has had so many political and economical reforms it is getting problematic keeping track of them all. Former PM Poul Schlüter said in a speech it was time for people to eat potatoes and make extra holes in  the belt. That reform specifically targeted consumption by either taxing the money away from people or taxing the products to make them to expensive. The reform was named the potato diet reform, as in we should get used to eating potatoes and nothing else. Hence the reason for tightening belts to keep up pants.

The idea that only southern Europe does austerity is plain wrong. We just do it year after year in smaller increments. It is easier to accept them that way, and the reforms are less interfering in peoples daily lives if they start before the problem manifests itself.

If by ""everything it stands for"" you mean ""crippling austerity that ruins the economy and lives of millions of people"", then it is actually good that the south is kicking against it and actually wanting some reform.

There is literally no economic justification for the current austerity rules they are simply weird made up things, like taking the average debt ratio of all countries and just saying ""the new rule is that this is the maximum you can be in debt"". Why?  Is there an economic reason? No! It is just the average and so it kinda sounds cool I guess?

Its absolutely brain dead to think you can austerity yourself out of a economic crisis, but certain countries, like the netherlands or germany still want this to be a rule for southern countries despite it having no basis in reality.

5970,"&gt; we’ll see who is right in 6 month

No, that's what people don't seem to get. Acting against everything we knew about the virus, about what had been successful elsewhere, recommendations from experts everywhere but Sweden etc. at that time will never be ""the right way to act"", no matter the outcome. Nothing pointed to your strategy being the right one when it was chosen. Nada.

We only have a single outbreak so it's not like we can even compare any meaningful numbers to get a general idea of what works etc. because we have nothing to compare it to. We'd need more than a single pandemic to see some kind of trend.

The problem isn't ""what works"" in a single case, that could simply be down to luck/random chance, down to differences in culture, down to climate or environment, down to health of a population, down to behavior differences between countries, down to a difference in popular holiday destinations that year or whatever.

If for example infected Swedes were mostly younger people due to most of them getting it from a specific ""party/ski place"" in Italy, then obviously not many of them are likely to die. That's not due to your strategy working though, that'd be due to the virus being less deadly to younger people. That would still have been the case with an entirely different strategy.


The problem with Sweden's strategy will remain a problem no matter the eventual outcome. They acted against everything we knew about the virus when they chose their strategy, that's a problem no matter if they ""get away with it"" this time or whatever. 

Your expert Tegnell was also wrong about just about everything he said during the early days, that's also a problem no matter the outcome. Why is he your main expert on this stuff if he apparently doesn't know anything about it and seems to disagree with just about every other expert on the planet? He hasn't been the one fighting ebola in Africa or whatever for the past 20 years like some of the WHO folks for example, so why would he know better?
