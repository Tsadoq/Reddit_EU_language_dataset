Think of the UK, much better developed economy that had been a wealthy place for generations, and yet they are going to face problems of rising prices on goods after Brexit to say nothing of how destructive the last 4 years have been  within the UK politically. Poland has only seen real economic prosperity since the 2000's on the other hand. Wheres the money going to come from if Poland leaves? Can poland maintain its economic trajectory if theres no more grants and no more tarriff free trade with its neighbours?

&amp;#x200B;

I think what needs to happen is a slow and gradual dialog among the polish people, (particularly focusing on input from those Poles who live in the west and eventually return home ) about the nature of what the EU is and what its done for other states and for Poland herself, because as an Irish person I can tell you, we would not have even half the eonomic prosperity we currently enjoy of we had remained outside the bloc - joining it in the 70's was the most forward thinking decision we ever made as an independent state and we know it; satisfaction with the EU consistantly polls around the 90% in the Republic of Ireland.",,/r/europe/comments/hv0isx/eu_adopts_groundbreaking_stimulus_to_fight/fyr5kws/,AnBearna,1595328718

45,"Excuse me Sir. This is the Internet. 

No-one is going to be swayed by any argument, as no-one is going to believe in the other sides pro-con hypotheses. 

If you genuinely believe that the EU is doing a good job, and you honestly think that what is being accomplished is the best we can do, then good for you. 

The EU wants you to believe that it can offer a free lunch, that somehow you can get a fat dog from letting it eat its own tail.

Here's an example: 

Denmark needed some new trains, and Ansaldo was supposed to deliver them. Except, those trains were fraught with problems and eventually got scrapped. At least one train that was supposed to be delivered in Denmark ended up somewhere in Africa - apparently a gift from Italy to some despot.

Why should Ansaldo improve their game? If they make shitty trains and lose business because of it, the EU will come up with some wonderful program to make up for the loss. ""Think of the workers"" the tired old song goes. 

Should we just settle, and let the EU save every company that makes terrible products? You could argue that yes, yes it should, because... you know.... what's the alternative? Surely, shitty trains is better than certain death!!! 

What about the people who DO know how to make good trains. They're now out of a job because we decided to go with the ones that can't. So we got bad trains, people who didn't know what they were doing was rewarded, and people who DID got laid off.

To make matters worse, before the money end up in the hands of someone as a reward for doing something constructive, it will have passed through hundreds of people who probably feel they deserve a cut, because they work hard, are stressed out and so on. Basically, one person is busy and stressed out about digging a hole, while someone else is stressed out about not filling it fast enough.

So, what's the alternative?

I would propose that the EU is reduced to a trade union, and not this political monstrosity that it has become. 

One unified taxation across the EU for businesses - how that should be done practically, I don't know. I am just tired of seeing Ireland and Luxembourg raping the system while the 0.01% laughs at us for making such moronic laws. 

If Italy has spent all their money on shits and giggles, and now want to stimulate their economy, they can plead with the markets. The markets may not approve of lending spendthrifts money, so the solution is pretty straightforward: clean up your act, and the markets will lend you money. Now, they can get money and not change a thing (and feel free to wake me up when a country is penalized for not following through on their ""reform plans"").

The continued expansion and pilfering in the name of solidarity will eventually tear the union apart, and since I feel very strongly that a united Europe is desirable, I also feel that proponents of the ""the world will end if you do not pay up"" are actually causing that to happen. 

I understand that the grand vision is one nation and I have sympathy for that, but the vision will never come to be, as there are so many people who see the EU as a type of sugar-daddy that will finance our every whim.",,/r/europe/comments/hv0a7w/breaking_during_day_5_of_the_eu_council_summit_a/fyr5xc0/,morten_tor,1595329055

So does India also has some stake in the deal in this budget? No right? 
This is because there are not enough opportunities back in India for educated individuals and India is not doing Europe a favor. Likewise Italy is not doing Europe a favor by becoming a source of brain drain. Infact, it means a better lifestyle and more opportunities for its citizens. So the idea that somehow Northern Europe or the 'frugals' should pay Italy by providing Italians with better jobs and lifestyle sounds stupid.

There is agreement on the budget and the package for the economy. - It was a long marathon, we overcame various crises related to agreeing the budget. Europe needs an investment injection, said Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.

\- The joint work of the Visegrad Group has led to a success that we can present. It is both a financial success and a success for the supervision architecture, said Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki at the conference. - We wanted these sums to be as high as possible - he added.

\- Today it is worth being a Pole, we were soldiers in Mateusz Morawiecki's team - said Hungarian Prime Minister Wiktor Orban.

Recall that the EU leaders agreed that the budget would amount to EUR 1 trillion 74 billion, and the fund for the recovery of European economies after the COVID-19 pandemic - EUR 750 billion in the form of grants and loans.

\-  **124 billion Euro in direct subsidies. There was no such amount before. It is a good contact for Poland. Together with loans, it is over 160 billion euros.** It will be a good investment injection, stressed the head of government.

**Morawiecki pointed out that budget expenses will not be related to - as he put it - the so-called the rule of law.** Interestingly, the head of the European Council Charles Michel and the head of the European Commission Ursula van der Leyen jointly announced at a conference on Tuesday that it would be completely different.",,/r/europe/comments/hv1f12/historical_agreement_morawiecki_polish_pm_we_got/fyqk9vd/,TyrantfromPoland,1595308340

421,"You have misunderstood the problem. It is not that ""China has paid too many organisations and governments billions of dollars and they are all compromised now"". Surely, Chinese investments do play a role, but the bigger problem is that the well-being of Australia's economy heavily depends on China. China is the major trading partner of the Australian mining industry, for example. Chinese tourists and Chinese university students are important for the Australian economy. Many products would be much more expensive if they were imported from places other than China. And so on. 

Now if Australia decided to stop doing business with China (this is the major thing Australia could do regarding China), the Australian economy would have a massive downturn. Especially in times of Corona this is not an option. China however would barely be affected by such a major step because the Australian economy is quite small compared with China's.

So essentially, there is not much Australia can do at all. And this even applies to the US, if you fully think this through. Because noone would start WW3 over the Uighurs.

What makes things even worse is that the world needs a cooperative relationship with China. Not only for economic reasons, but also to tackle climate change, for example.

I could totally give a hell lot of concession to a statement like ""Turkey's policy of Turkification of the island is dangerous"" or ""Turks stir things"" up but definitely not ""Greeks weren't slaughtering Turks for their bizarre nationalistic aims"" or ""Turks should've stood still until they went extinct"".

588,"&gt; Instead now we get the transfer union certain sides have been pushing for for decades...

So, setting aside the specific covid-19 business and this recovery fund...I don't see how it's realistic for the EU *not* to have a transfer union in the long term, and that that was a decision that EU member states had effectively committed to once they crossed the line to free movement of labor, not to mention introducing the euro.

If you're gonna have free movement, then you screw over EU members that are losing workforce -- they invest money into doing things like childbirth and education or commit to paying pensions, but then when their workforce leaves, they lose the investment that they made.

If you're gonna have a single currency, then the currencies cannot float with respect to each other, so the mechanism of ""trade deficit produces inflation which counteracts trade deficit"" doesn't function any more.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimum_currency_area

&gt; The four often cited criteria for a successful currency union are:[6]

-

&gt; * A risk sharing system such as an automatic fiscal transfer mechanism to redistribute money to areas/sectors which have been adversely affected by the first two characteristics. This usually takes the form of taxation redistribution to less developed areas of a country/region. This policy, though theoretically accepted, is politically difficult to implement as the better-off regions rarely give up their revenue easily. Theoretically, Europe has a no-bailout clause in the Stability and Growth Pact, meaning that fiscal transfers are not allowed. During the 2010 Eurozone crisis (relating to government debt), the no-bailout clause was de facto abandoned in April 2010.[10] Subsequent theoretical analysis suggests that this was always an unrealistic expectation.[11]

Otherwise, you seriously dick over a number of EU members.

I can understand -- even if I think that it is a bad idea in terms of geopolitics and would oppose it if I lived in the EU -- saying ""I want the EU to just be a free trade area, no common currency, no free movement of labor, *and* I don't want a transfer union"".  But it seems to me that if one chooses the first two, one is pretty much on the hook for the third.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/huvl2i/eu_leaders_agree_on_blocs_spending_and_750bn/fypy4d2/,duisThias,1595294220

663,"&gt; Its surprising that smth like 15 years ago when we and others were joining the EU it was about solidarity and hearing everyone's, and now I see posts like ""small countries should obey""-style.

Winston Churchill's Zurich speech back in 1946, which heralded the creation of several European institutions, was pretty explicit on the matter:

https://rm.coe.int/16806981f3

&gt;I am now going to say something that will astonish you. The first step in the re-creation of the European family must be a partnership between France and Germany. In this way only can France recover the moral and cultural leadership of Europe.There can be no revival of Europe without a spiritually great France and a spiritually great Germany. The structure of the United States of Europe will be such as to make the material strength of a single State less important. **Small nations will count as much as large ones** and gain their honour by a contribution to the common cause. The ancient States and principalities of Germany, freely joined for mutual convenience in a federal system, might take their individual places among the United States of Europe.

-

&gt;I now sum up the propositions which are before you. Our constant aim must be to build and fortify the United Nations Organisation. Under and within that world concept we must re-create the European family in a regional structure called, it may be, the United States of Europe, and the first practical step will be to form a Council of Europe. If at first all the States of Europe are not willing or able to join a union we must nevertheless proceed to assemble and combine those who will and who can.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/hupm50/emmanuel_macron_accuses_dutch_of_acting_like/fypju6x/,duisThias,1595286168

1. Social programs in Southern Europe=pensions. Outside of pensions other social programs are modest. Families get little and unsurprisingly both child poverty and early school leaving rates are high. The issues is that pensioners are exploding in numbers and those costs are unsustainable. There are few pro-natalist policies and immigrants are largely unskilled (especially in Italy). Who is supposed to pay for those pensions? No one ever says.

2. Labour laws as they are at the moment do not seem to be food if we consider that Southern Europe has had the worst unemployment in the block for quite some time now. Most countries with flexible labour laws have better worker welfare indicators than places like Spain or Italy. Furthermore the laws favour older workers over new entrants, which explain the huge youth unemployment despite there being few young people of working age in the South.

The simple fact that the gap in social and economic indicators between the South and the North has never closed and is now widening, or that the CEE countries are forecast to leapfrog the South in the next few years should be ringing alarm bells.

690,"I'm pretty sure some of this informations are wrong

-This is most definitely not correct. The only people thar are eurosceptic and prone to leave the Euro (they never spoke of EU, but we all know that that is what it would entail) is Salvini with the Lega, that is at the opposition. He has been actively against any help coming from the EU and trying to prevent them. He was against Eurobond and I'm sure that he cannot wait for this to be a complete fiasco, so he has shot to premiership. Conte is def not eurosceptic and the same goes for the PD which is also in the goverment

- I'm not sure Rutte is pro all the things you mentioned. From the little I know about him he is mostly neo-Liberal. The only thing that I heard him mention about reforms was cutting pensions (that wathever you might think about them is provading money to people that might otherwise be poor), I also heard him praise some of the reforms that Renzi was trying to do in terms of labour laws. Those were often criticised by the Italian left (the only europhile part of the country remained) for worsening labour conditions. On top of that in the previous round of austerity under Monti (under EU pressure), Italy went through a lot of cuts to education, healthcare and general living standards. The current situations to a lot of Italians seams eerily reminiscent, can't blame them for their distrust. I hope you are right, and that he really does want all of those things. But his position until now would require constant possibility of veto and make any action to recover the economy almost impossible because of the constant disagreement that would ensue, and the likelyhood of some countries taking other hostage in exchange of backdoors deals.","Veneto, Italy",/r/europe/comments/hup8am/dutch_pm_mark_rutte_the_thrifty_europhile_holding/fypkduu/,Giallo555,1595286454

1. TFR increased according to the Eurostat -&gt; You disputed it with official sources

2. +5% increase in the number of births is a success during worsening demographic trends -&gt; You only consider immediate and full solutions

That's all.

Everything besides is simple curiosity.

---

&gt; At least not in the sense Hungary is trying to bribe people to have kids. It's only us and to a far lesser extent Poland trying to do it. Other countries have average spendings on families (around 2.5-3%).

On a serious note,

1. The program in the article was enacted in the last year, so it's way to early to make any judgements.

2. I'm not convinced that simple comparisons of different Eastern European countries are insightful.

Welfare distribution isn't waste even if it doesn't achieve specific goals. Otherwise, the Nordic countries would biggest wasters (rapidly falling TFR despite biggest benefits).

---

Also, I don't think that the spending numbers are right.

For example, my calculations are quite different for Hungary:

* 2.75 billion euro spent in [2018 on family according to Eurostat](https://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=spr_exp_ffa&amp;lang=en)

* 2.18 billion euro additionally spent on the program in 2019

* 143.82 billion euro is [the latest GDP number](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/tec00001/default/table?lang=en).

=&gt; (2.75 + 2.18) / 143.82 * 100% = 3.4% of GDP.

So, 5% of GDP seems like a lie to me, at least in the article itself

The soppressata was smoky and fatty and meaty and I wanted to cram a handful of it straight into my face because I’ve never had anything like it.

807,"&gt;I’m not questioning democracy, it’s just that values need to align for a democracy to succeed.

The entire point of democracy is healthy competition in the marketplace of ideas of different points of view. The entire structure is based on NOT alligning. And because of this, we vote, and as a consequence, somebody wins and somebody loses. 

But in a healthy democracy, the person who loses accepts it and tries better next time, instead of holding the entire marketplace hostage because he can't make a sufficiently convincing point.

&gt;If anything, we’re doing the opposite. Having Italians and Spaniards reform their governments right now pushes the load on the current generation, instead of future generations.

I think you're not realizing that the sticking point is not the reforms. It's the vetos.  I don't think the Dutch government is giving you the full story on their actual demands.

&gt;Also, taking drastic measures in a tricky situation is apperiantly the same as undermining an established democracy and using emergency power to make anti-LGBT laws?

Those are also ""drastic measures"" to those that implemented them. This is the thing about democracy: no one thinks they're wrong, the vote just settles that they're not convincing. Stepping over that because you can't be bothered to work your way to an actual majority is the problem, because that's when democracy dies, when we no longer have the power of actual choice.

942,"The other day we were having a nice chat at work. I think it was something trivial about where to go on vacations and ranking local people based on hotness. We're quite the international team, so opinions greatly varied. When it came to Turkey a Cypriot colleague of ours expressed the opinion that she could never ever see a Turkish person this way, possibly never even as a friend. This was kind of shocking for us, knowing her, because she is very much a good person, and at first glance it seemed seriously closed minded, so we pressed her on it.  


She told us that when the invasion of the island happened, her father fled instantly and her grandfather stayed behind for a while to try to convince he her grandmother to also flee. But she  would refuse to leave her only house so she stayed behind. She was never seen again and was presumed missing by the Cypriot state. One of many civilians who were killed in occupied Cyprus. She told that that she harbors no negative feelings for those not responsible, but she wouldn't be at ease at the possibility that a Turk or Turkish Cypriot that would be her closed friend or loved one would end up being related to the people who killed her Grandmother for no reason. There really wasn't hate in her words, just legitimate concern and sadness. She even told us that she have visited Turkey and loved it, and that she is pro-unification.

Many Foxconn factories are opened in East European countries, with very low labour cost, you can import CPU and computer mainboard from U.S, and install them into a machine, then export a computer...and how much profits and wage you can earn? So Canada, Spain and Australia have much higher labour cost per hour in manufacturing sector, because they export valuable machine tools and pharmaceutical products.

Plus, you can check GVA added per worker (https://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?queryid=67053), if my memory does not go wrong, average GVA added per worker in manufacturing sector for Canada is above $100k, for Spain and Australia is $80k and for Czechia is $30k+, the higher GVA added per worker, the higher the labour productivity and the higher the average wage and average household disposable income in whole society.

So, while we see some nuclear reactors being opened here and there, overall this is nowhere near enough. Nuclear power has been around since the 50s, it's been ready as a technology since the 60s, and yet  60 years  later we barely produce 10% of  our energy needs from nuclear.

EEG is to make quick investments very attractive, that is how germanies renewables grew so fast over the last years, otherwise the companies would just continue running their coal plants because that is cheaper over the next years instead of building new plants, even if those would be cheaper over their lifetime of 20+ years. EEG also gets reworked nearly every year so it does not be a too large burden on the consumer, it is currently 1/5th of the price a consumer pays.

to recap: companies do not like to make investments because those mean a huge loss of money. Even though renewables are cheaper, the transition would be slow. EEG is there to speed things up and will be gone sooner or later.

I think you are looking at this from a moralistic and emotive point of view and I think that is the wrong one to take. You should distinguish between what is correct and what is convenient. I think in this particular situation it is more convenient for you to care about Italy's future.

I just read the article you sent and, if understund correctly, he is suggesting that a big reason why this measures are taken is because french and german banks are really fragile to the Italian dept fall-out (that is probably correct). Shouldn't that worry you even more? Germany and France are the two biggest economies of the EU a collapse of both their financial systems, at the same time, would provoke a crises the likes of which we have never seen.

In other words, the Central European countries are demanding that Southern Europe:

- Stop caring for their elderly, which would lead to the deaths of thousands, a full frontal attack on the living past of our people;

- Deregulate the job market, widening existing wage gap between the Sout the rest of European work force, which is a full frontal attack on our present;

- Stop education spending, condemning future generation to servitude as the cheap workforce and as a thinly veiled attempt to destroy our culture, which is a full frontal attack on our future.

1153,"Because the single market is the best trade deal for everyone. It is just disingenuous to start attaching all these budget conditions to the trade deal, because even without it, everyone would be better off with the trade deal/single market and without the budget, than without both.

The bigger the trade deal/the closer you get to a 'single market type trade deal', the greater the benefits for all. That is why the Netherlands likes, it, but fundamentally it is still just a really comprehensive trade deal. It just seems that some countries have gotten the mindset that they deserve extra money on top of that, and more money every time a new budget is negotiated or they will start throwing tantrums. 

And final point, for the countries profiting less from the single market, to what extent is that their own fault? Who profits most from the single market: small, open economies with flexibility in their institutional arrangements, a drive to remain competitive and a focus on good governance, cutting of red tape and bureaucracy and avoiding too much corruption. I see some countries on the list of benefitting less that could definitely do a lot more to improve their benefits from the single market. Some eastern European countries definitely benefitted a lot from the single market already, and you can probably tell why they have done better than some of their peers who entered at the same time, and it will be due to some of the aspects I mentioned above.

Now of course there are aspects that countries cannot change easily. Greece is on the periphery of the EU geographically, and has long been isolated by lacking a land corridor to other EU countries. But that is only part of the picture. And Italy and Spain have no such excuse. (Spain by the way I think is still doing pretty well). They have hit a rough patch, but in my view they have enough potential to be more succesful in the long term. In terms of economic resilience, I am more worried in the long term about France than about Spain.

1186,"&gt; taken everything is already drafted in a summit from may it would even make less sense for me. the countries already pledged to make those commitements right? so why not agree that the money from the rescue package is tied to fullfilling those conditions? if u dont want to use the money for something else then why do u decline an oberserver?

they're not. From a resident of a frugal country, the same happened here. Kurz vehemently insisted for weeks on the EU not to collectively indebt themselves in the future even though the draft states exactly that it's time-limited. I don't know about the situation in Sweden and Denmark but in Austria and the Netherlands it's domestic strategies. Kurz has always branded himself as not being ""one of those typical EU politicians"" and a huge part of his voter base are people who used to vote for the far-right. They are obviously the ones who dismiss helping out other countries out of hand so just accepting the Merkel-Macron plan would portray him as pleasing and weak to them. 

As you can read in the article posted here, it's similar in the Netherlands.

I'd say both the frugal and the southern countries are right now just trying to look good domestically to gain votes leading to the frugal ones taking an iron stance on handouts while the southern ones are heavily campaigning for them. That's the sad reality about EU negotiations.

&gt;the only reason i see why EU needs italy is for the stability of the € after the brexit, *cough looking at the 2500B € debt of italy which is many times higher then greeces*. italy especially need EU not the the other way around (as far as i could deduce) as most of the GDP from italy comes from export into the EU market. from past reports it can even been seen how EU criti. italy for the mismanagment and the poor performance and attiude within the EU.

Funnily enough, on the occasion of the discussion here I calculated the immediate growth deficits yesterday each EU country would suffer from if Italy and Spain were to stop trade altogether with us. I can send you the spreadsheet if you want, most average at -(3-4%) as a ratio of exports/GDP and those are only the *immediate* effects, not covering the consequences (dominoes falling from south all over the EU) so the deficits would be considerably larger.

And yes, Italy is in dire need of the EU. But I can only repeat myself - it's a two way lane. Which negotiating party has more leverage is hardly defined but one shouldn't forget the geopolitical effects as well which would result from the EU basically abandoning Italy (China, Russia, etc).

1213,"Panaghia Mou, Panaghia Mou (""My Lady, My Lady"") was the Greek entry at the Eurovision Song Contest 1976 in The Hague performed by Mariza Koch.

The song, beseeching at Mary herself, was directed specifically against the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974. Turkey's subsequent debut at the Eurovision Song Contest 1975 was the reason Greece withdrew. In an additional twist, Turkey broadcast the Grand Final despite not participating, albeit censoring the Greek entry and putting a Turkish nationalist song in its place.

It was performed 10th on the night following Finland and preceding Norway. At the close of voting, it finished in 13th place with 20 points.

The singer told in an interview that the organizers of Eurovision asked her not to perform her entry because there was information about a Turkish sniper there and her life was in danger, so she signed a paper stating she will perform under her own responsibility.

**English Lyrics**

*Fields full of oranges, oh-oh my Mother*

*Where olive trees spread from end to end*

*Around them, the seashores shine like gold, oh-oh my Mother*

*And you’re blinded, blinded by the intense light*

 

*When you go to this place, oh-oh my Mother*

*And you see, you see tents in a row*

*It’s not a camping place for tourists, oh-oh my Mother*

*They’re only, only refugees*

 

*My Lady, my Lady, Soothe my heart*

*My Lady, my Lady, Soothe my heart*

 

*And if you see shattered ruins, oh-oh my Mother*

*It’s not from other, from other eras*

*It is burnt by napalm, oh-oh my Mother*

*Since yesterday, there are countless crumbled rocks*

*And if you see newly dug land, oh-oh my Mother*

*They’re not fertile fields, fields*

*There will be crosses planted on them, oh-oh my Mother*

*Which will decompose, decompose through time*

 

*My Lady, my Lady, Soothe my heart*

*My Lady, my Lady, Soothe my heart*",Cyprus,/r/europe/comments/huj7zo/greeces_eurovision_entry_of_1976_a_song_about_the/fynbrip/,Bran37,1595242454

1241,"&gt; Every single country's laws disagree with that and favour married couples for various reasons. The major one not being some religious stuff, but the gouvernment being unwilling to pay money to single mothers or children without fathers. Thats their main drive usually.

This point alone would stop it go through in Germany for example. You can't threat people different just because they are not married.

&gt; No. Its like excluding non married families from certain tax or regulatory benefits. Which is a thing here or anywhere. From Latvia to Portugal.

No it's like paying families child money and non married families not. It's like stopping payments to people that divorced (in Germany you get more money if you are a single parent).

And in Germany you get a ""Kinderfreibetrag"". It doesn't matter if you are married or not to get it, it's just a bureaucratic act, but once it's declared you will reap the benefit from it. You don't lose that if you aren't married.

&gt; And I dont really complain even though I never plan on marrying or having kids.

And that shows. Your information is not true.

In Germany you get tax benefits for being married. But this doesn't include these ""Kinderfreibeträge"" (a flat tax reduction for every child you have). These have more impact compared to the tax class benefits you get. You also get child money without being married. In Germany a law like this would be illegal as it's not conform with the ""Grundgesetz"".

Germany wants to protect the marriage, therefore you get the tax benefits from tax class. But it's not combined with children funds.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/hug4n7/hungarian_government_paying_citizens_to_start/fynby7d/,Are_y0u,1595242633

All it requires is a change in a few lines of the law on civil marriage. It doesn't require technology or infrastructure. Nobody's lives will be affected, except for the person who wants to marry the one they love. 

We were the first to drink the water to show it is safe and good. What argument would you still have to not drink as well? It's basically us finding a cure for COVID19 and then saying ""naah, we'll wait"", or one country inventing flight and then going ""hmmm, not really sure this is for us"".

This is a non-issue, that is made into an artificial problem by a bunch of short sighted neanderthals. Gay marriage doesn't destroy society, it doesn't pose a moral hazard to innocent children, it doesn't damage the sanctity of marriage. It doesn't threaten religious marriage.

1312,"Most houses in Ghent are pretty shit. Old, weird layout, etc. There are also a lot of students that come to Gent, so the renting market is a bit weird.


If you want a modern apartment at a decent size (100 square meters+), it starts at 900 euros (Exclusive) or so. But 700-ish is the ""cut of point"" for anything good as anything cheaper is taken up by students. A lot of people co-house for that reason. They live with someone and split a bigger apartment. The students definitely drive up renting prices. But you might get lucky. Alternatively, the locals tend to buy a house on the out skirts  at the age of 25 or so and live here for the rest of their lives. 


Health care is between 10-50 euros a month. Include food and it can range between 150-400 euros a month.  


Unless you love going to bars and drinking every other weekend, you probably want to own a car. There are a bunch of activities just outside of the city. Including some bigger stores you might want to have access too. Otherwise there isn't much to do and biking only gets you so far. 


There are quite a few events throughout the year, but they are mostly drinking related. Gentse feesten is a big one. It's a 10 day drinking and partying fest in the middle of town. If you live in the city center, you wont get any sleep for 10-11 days. 


Average Income is around 2500 euro net, if i'm not mistaken. The median is a lot lower.  Taxes are really high so you are almost immediately in the top 45% / 50% tax bracket. https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Taxation_in_Belgium
So keep that in mind if you are looking for a comparable job to what you have now. You will probably make less then any other western country. But the cost of living can be very low.


The town is also a bit of a hippie town. So lots of people sit in parks and chill outside. People do a lot of slack-lining, canoeing and that kind of stuff. If you like old architecture like the picture above. There is more of it sprinkled around town. If you are not into that stuff, this town is probably not for you.  Though I'd say you could just visits the town for a good weekend and have seen all of it.


As a last bit, Belgians in Gent are not the type to socialize extensively with foreigners. This town is very much a village in the way they handle outsides.

The second world war left a power vacuum in Indonesia with a lot of anti-white violence. The Dutch troops in Indonesia were meant to keep the Europeans safe. So the decolonisation meant 300.000 white, mixed and pro-European Indonesians had to flee their homeland and come to Europe because Indonesia was no longer safe without Dutch protection.

1441,"&gt;Exactly, but currently that is being done by an unelected, partisan Supreme Court.

Well if they were elected it would be juste another political organ, the suprem court is not elected in the US nor in any country I can think off.

&gt;Having an unelected judicial power that is able to be extremely powerful and above the other 2 branches, without any checks is dangerous. 

Well Poland was considered as the best demicracy of the eastern block back then, they don't seem so harmfull.

&gt;But the ''struggle'' here is not the judicial vs the executive, but the judicial vs the executive and the legislative branches. Judicial activism is a real problem, it has been studied academically as well as politically and sociologically. 

Once again I didn't say that a reform was not needed, the problem is the way PiS choose to do it but I'll comeback on this later.

&gt;Being appointed by someone doesn't make them extremely partisan automatically. Just see the US Supreme Court

Indeed, however the US put only judge in those kind of position not politician. And the suprem court in the US is your suprem court + the constitutional tribunal

&gt;The Constitution of Poland has decided that it is the Constitutional Tribune, not the Supreme Court who decides on matters of constitutionality. So you agree with me that it is wrong for the Supreme Court to contradict the Polish Constitution?

Yes but actually no, I have to dig a bit in recent Poland history for this. The first step taken by the PiS was to change the rules around the constitutional tribunal so they can put there member on the board. They, for the first time in Poland history, put politician on this board. Is this what you want for Poland ? Each time the governement flip side, they should be able to change the rules of your democracy to put their people in position of power ? The KRS back then protested against this so the PiS reformed them, this lead to the only organ from your justice system that is still independant, the suprem court, this is why they are backed by the EU.

Once again Poland as the right to reform itself this is not the question. The question his about the method used, one political party, taking slowly control of the justice to push his agenda ? Well, we've seen this before, this was never the rise of democracy. 

Now let's say that they have only the best intention, think about the message that this governement send to the next one. ""You didn't like our justice system? Well change the constitutional court, change the KRS, change the suprem court, profit""

You cannot use force even with the best intention on this kind of subject otherwise you just lower the level of what is acceptable in your democracy, and the PiS from the start with the constitutional tribunal goes full force on this topic.",,/r/europe/comments/htypfv/viktor_orbán_i_dont_know_why_mark_rutte_hates_me/fymy76c/,tozoroto,1595228604

&gt; 6 billion a year goes from Flanders to Wallonia

Yes, transfers happen within regions of the same country, as they do in all countries on Earth: richer regions contribute more to the budget than poorer regions. More breaking news at 10.

Besides, it only works like that when looking at regions. If you look at the provinces, Walloon Brabant actually contributes more than any Flemish province except Flemish Brabant. On the other hand, Limburg and West Flanders are also on the receiving end. It's far from black and white ""rich and productive flemings pay for poor and lazy walloons"" like the nationalists try to frame it.

&gt; where 70% of that money gets spend on social measures and not on investing in the economy

This is false. The figure you are referencing is that 70% of Walloon GDP comes from public money. Which is too much, for sure, but it's not what's being spent on social measures, not at all. A lot of these are investments, exactly what you want them to do. Actually, most social measures are still at the federal level (healthcare, unemployment benefits, pensions, etc.). Regions don't have the competences to spend much on social measures.

&gt; Where one (Walloon) man called Wallonia out as being communist on the backs of the Flemish.

That's not the point the guy made. He said that a lot of people seem to think that we are on the verge of becoming a neo-liberal economy. He then argued that, with 70% of GDP coming from public money, Wallonia is actually closer to communism (where it would be 100%) than to neo-liberalism (where it would be closer to 0%). He never said that Wallonia was communist, because that would be absolutely false.

&gt; Wallonia suffers from 4th generation unemployment

What does that even mean? That people who are unemployed are children of unemployed people who are themselves children and grand-children of unemployed people? How can one be that arrogant or stupid to believe that? Have you ever been unemployed? Do you know anything of the hardships this can bring?

I used to love Merkel, now I cant stand her. I don't know why I was so shill like, completely ignoring how she managed to ignore the worlds greatest atrocities while signing one deal after another with such a vial disgusting regime and no I'm not talking about Trump, even worse. Sad!

When I look back at it, she never spoke up for Obama when US was taking a giant beaten for supposedly taking German data on a mass scale. Merkel had to know the entire time that it was Germany selling that data willingly and when it was leaked that it was the case, there was no apology of the sort, just silence but when everyone thought it was the US - she acted like an innocent victim. Fortunately, they did spy on the German government without their permission including Merkel herself.

EU it's the same thing. What Merkel ultimately wants, Merkel ultimately gets. With the current deal being working out, Merkel will get the longest stick, Germany will get the longest stick while the rest of us get fucked. But leave it to redditors to find some graph or chart to say ""oh no you see, if anything Germany is the one constantly getting screwed!""

Merkel only knows one thing and that is the sound of euros being pumped into her economy and as a German, why would you have anything to complain about when it comes to her? If a close relationship with the CCP means a richer Germany, who cares about human rights?

1645,"From Deepl:

&gt;In one of the most famous books by the Portuguese writer José Saramago, The City of the Blind, a motorist standing in front of a traffic light suddenly goes blind. After him the same thing happens to other inhabitants of the city for inexplicable reasons. Soon the whole public life is disrupted. Law and order, care, food supply - everything sinks into chaos and lawlessness. No one, Saramago wrote in this dark fable about the degeneration of civilization, ""knew from now on when the light was on red"".

&gt;Tell the Portuguese about the rule of law. Their country was a military dictatorship from 1926 to 1974. Only after that it became a member of the European Union: only democracies are allowed to join. If there is one European prime minister for whom the erosion of the rule of law in Hungary, Poland and other EU countries is a personal slap in the face, it is the Portuguese prime minister António Costa. Those countries are in the club. Nobody can expel them. They make that clear - assertive, cynical, turning every word inside out until it loses its meaning. For Costa, the son of a writer who was imprisoned three times for criticizing the Salazar government, that must be bitter.

&gt;Yet it was Costa who traveled and phoned Europe this week to tell government leaders how stupid it is to link European subsidies from the budget and the corona repair fund to the health of the rule of law. Because of that link, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán immediately threatened to block the budget and the recovery fund.

&gt;Costa is right. That link is stupid. If anyone can say it, it's him. It's just a pity he only started talking about it when Orbán vetoed it. It made it look like Costa only came up with it because he was afraid he wouldn't get his grants.

&gt;Costa's central argument is that you shouldn't use European values, democracy and the rule of law in negotiations about money. When you negotiate, you give and take. That's how you make European values negotiable - which they shouldn't be, never. ""If you negotiate about values and money,"" Costa wrote Wednesday in the newspaper Público, ""don't defend those values but monetize them. They become change."" 

&gt;According to northern countries, only functioning democracies should receive European money. That sounds super. Good for our conscience. In the latest budget proposals, this requirement has been tightened up to make it more attractive to the northerners. But in matters over which every European head of government has a veto, such as the EU budget, you put everything in the hands of those who violate European values. Orbán can shoot down the budget, without any improvement in Hungary. Win-win for Budapest. ""Thus, out of naivety or cynicism, we would repeat the process in which Orbán vetoed Franz (sic) Timmermans as President of the Commission last year,"" Costa writes.

&gt;Is there nothing we can do then? Yes, we can. When it comes to values and the rule of law, the EU has a special procedure: Article 7 of the treaty. If countries continue to ignore warnings from Brussels, those cases eventually come before the European Court. That is difficult and annoyingly slow. But it is the only way. Political pressure from Brussels does not work. Only the Court can whistle countries back. Hungary usually takes a step back before cases come to court. Poland has been convicted twice. And twice, to avoid sanctions, it has overturned laws that restrict judges.

&gt;Finally, this. Saramago was quite a pessimist. So were we. We recognize ourselves effortlessly in those blind people, right? But watch out. At the end of the book they'll be seen again and stop, as usual, for the red light.",Czech Republic / New Zealand,/r/europe/comments/hu52fn/mr_no_no_no_why_dutch_pm_rutte_plays_role_of_eu/fymgl73/,Unicorn_Colombo,1595214822

&gt;Most changes to whats morally and legally acceptable are not results of mass movements, instead of stuff like...

Most positive changes of late to what are legally and morally acceptable have been mass movements:
-Women's liberation and birth control
-The civil rights movement
-The gay rights movement
-The peace movement (against U.S. actions)

The next one applies to some countries and not to others that were more authoritarian, but-
-Health care &amp; education reforms by democratic socialists (At least here in the Nordics)

&gt;To say the least there is no one is even pretending to invest even a second in striving for establish the direction society would need to head towards, for greater good.

You obviously have read little literature about your political counterparts on the other side. It's dialectics, you establish the base value of what you are trying to achieve and calculate the end result - and what most societies claim they want, is maximum happiness (or a sense of meaningfulness, eudamonia, as humans can't be completely happy all the time) to their members. And most claim to be equal. Great, so let's roll with that.

Gay rights? - Two adults, no psychological damage. Happiness increases. Studies show that kids do as well or better.

Trans rights? - A person in psychological pain, researchers say that the best cure is for society to treat them as the gender they identify as. Great.

Pedophile 'rights'? - Children are psychologically traumatized if anything sexual happens. Happiness decreases. Non-offending pedophiles should be offered help and counseling to help cope with their emotions.

Incest rights? - Two, condescending adults? Happiness increases. Deformed kids? Happiness decreases. A vasectomy or protection is absolutely recommended. 

Ultimately, yes, it is an ever evolving art- hence the constant logical conversation and analytics of the recent scientific studies on human health. There is no ultimate metaphysical truth but we don't need a perfect society, but a better one.

&gt;Societal sciences are completely soaked with postmodernism, structuralism and the like

Only place I've ever heard that from is Dr Peterson who never quite establishes which postmodern writers and ideas are prevalent and why they're problematic. Hard to argue with that.

&gt;its a problem because it leads to situations like students accepting that african sorceresses can summon lightning

Never read about such a case, nor have I heard about any such ideas in any European university I know of. I know of some creationist professors and a pro-Russian emeritus professor, but I don't paint the whole university world by those examples.

While liberals in general but even more in the USA have their hearts in the right places but seem to miss the points, I still wouldn't rush to draw any conspiracies. Research does show that the more liberal a person is, the higher their IQ is on average. I am not surprised that university faculty may be higher on the intelligence scale.

You are going to doubt the legitimacy of any resource I could ever provide you because of your belief that there is a grand conspiracy behind every humanist field. But I'd like to instill the thought that maybe, just maybe those studying philosophy and human psyche have some professional integrity and reasoning abilities.

You do understand that it goes the other direction as well? Jordan Peterson is more than willing to use all tools and tactics to enforce HIS view about how science should be done, as well. And after claiming how pitiful and weak addicts are, the state he is in after refusing modern medicine here tells us enough about the validity of his integrity and his scientific approach.

Now, I'll leave this conversation here, as I realized you will not accept modern psychological and neurological science as you believe the conspiracy to be so deep rooted, and we can thus never find common ground. And as we'd be horribly derailed, as originally I was simply arguing against this:

&gt;If people are unwell, that can only be changed by dealing with and helping people the individuals, not by ""solving society"".

And I think I have made my point clear about that. A grassroots movement like socialism to solve society, just like with health care and education in the U.S. right now.

1737,"&gt;Yes the mortality rate when given proper treatment is really low even for fragile people


It's actually very low even without treatment, that was my point. In Sweden we dont put the elderly in ICU but mortality rate is still very low for 80+.

&gt;Now tell me what factor influence R0 and R1 spread 
And isn't pretty rare for pandemic to become worldwide that fast I mean it's pretty unprecedented 


R0 was decently high, i think around 3 at its peak? But taking basic precautions like Sweden did, we managed to get r1 down to 0.7, albeit it took a month longer than for our neighbors. Even at R1 = 1 will take significant time to reach a majority of the population with basic precautions, we actually had lockdown for the elderly and we shut down our workplaces, so the R1 was not at a dangerous rate even at our highest point. 

&gt;Been there done that
The world doing fine
In fact what we actually see is that country that shut down have a faster retake in economic spending than country that had toe dipping measure
Certainty of a loss is way better economically that uncertainty of loses because it let companies make informed rational decision


No we're not done, do you realize how destabilizing Corona has been to the global economy because of the lockdowns? The only reason it seems as we are fine is because all central banks stimulates it. The numbers as of now are still just artificial. Do you realize we are in the middle of settling a dispute in EU that could potentially lead to it breaking apart, all because we're debating economic subsidies. Do you realize that totalitarian leaders are capitalizing on the crisis to enforce their rule? Do you realize what happens when nations become protectionists? War. We are at the most destabilizing period of modern history right now and it doesn't take much to tilt the table at this point. The economic costs will take years to recover, just look how many loans we've taken to ensure a stable economy, do you not think these will impact monetary policies for many years to come? Even before Corona, minor changes in monetary policies was very carefully adjusted and analyzed to ensure it doesn't destabilize the system, now we're just pumping insane amounts of money and you don't consider this a risk to potentially collapse the economic system? I think most economists would agree with my point. 

I'm not gonna debate the economic outcomes as it's just forecasts at this point. We can evaluate the costs of the lockdown when 2020 is over and how well Sweden fared compared to other countries, but lets remember, we did shut down industries and offices just like all the other countries, the major difference was recommended lockdown vs. enforced lockdown. Looking at forecasts, Sweden is doing marginally better than our neighbors, but they vary a lot and with high statistical uncertainty so there is not enough substance to argue about. 

&gt;The life expectancy is the average year people die not how many year they should live
Yep sorry you are 85 now you aren't supposed to live bye 


Its how long they are expected to live, any day over that is a bonus (or not, depending on the individual). Looking at the majority deaths in Sweden, these are people living in elderly care (practically hospice), and I can't imagine most of them being overly happy about waiting to die anyway, at least that's how my own grandma at the age of 90 feels about her life, pains all over her body, hard to walk, cant do basic tasks, most of her friends and old family dead, depression, yes what a great life sitting in a chair just waiting for death to take her. 

&gt;Hum sorry is europe going into war due to a shutdown what the fuck are you on about have you read the news, are Italia ,france and England warzones now


Yeah the lockdowns could very much send Europe into a warzone like we've been for the most part of history, except for this little chapter of 75 years since WW2. Likely would take a few years to develop and after an economic collapse and the collapse of EU and NATO, but its absolutely a risk, especially considering the trade war against China that could lead to China mutually destroying all our economies (yes it is in their power), it would be a naive outlook on history to think otherwise.

&gt;But I do have the ability to talk to people that are alive and I can tell you they don't really wanna die 


Right, you speak for all elderly people of the world? Many of them are waiting to die, we just don't allow euthanasia.


&gt;As you can see shutting down the economy along with strong social protection measure doesn't destroy the economy at all in the long term (france,and Italia have a rapid retake of spending while their economy are known to usualy scale back really slowly usually) and reduce death by a lot


How can you speak of the long term economic impacts when we've only been in this for 4 months? We are talking economic recoveries that will take years to recover and monetary policies that are very off the charts at this point, which in it self could cause collapse.

One can understand fiscal rigidity even if we know that frugal countries would act exactly like southern countries if they had the same social problems; being frugal with a stable economy is easy. But moreover, the problem is that frugal countries still bear in mind outdated monetary theory and an irrational fear of inflation.

WE CAN CREATE MORE MONEY. WE CAN PRINT IT. IT CAN BE DONE. NOTHING BAD WILL HAPPEN. It's not a question of rich countries bleeding to prop up poor countries. Nowadays, the productive capacity of the eurozone is potentially much bigger than the flow of monetary value. Inflation is very hard to reach.

Also, you keep dodging the question about the initial argument / the video ( are people right or wrong in their view of the world ).

Maybe the issue is you know the video does show you were wrong ( maybe you've even watched it ), and you don't want to address the video because you'd have to admit you were incorrect, and you're just not the kind of person to ever admit you were mistaken ?

You also carefully avoid providing your definition of fascism. Is it because you realize if you actually provide that, it's going to become obvious exactly how you are wrong on that too?",,/r/europe/comments/htufyu/floating_houses_immune_to_rising_sea_levels_in/fyle5h8/,arthurwolf,1595192296

1950,"&gt;There is no such thing of ""society"", its just a group of people, there is no overmind, as we are not an eusocial species.

""...a large group of people who live together in an organized way, making decisions about how to do things and sharing the work that needs to be done. "" - Cambridge Dictionary

I am referring to the well-established concept used by 99,9% of the world. I am not sure what you are trying to achieve with playing semantics.

&gt;If people are unwell, that can only be changed by dealing with and helping people the individuals, not by ""solving society"".

Would you say that in Russia or the PRC? How about North Korea, Cuba, Iran or Somalia? Why does the argument not work on the West, then? Was abolishing slavery or decriminalizing homosexuality not solving society rather than helping individual people? 

You talk about the individuals because you grew up on this exact system, and think it's the non-political, neutral default way of being. But once you start to look at the structures that define modern existence you will notice that by and large there are good, beneficial things, but also some that are in dire need of rework.

&gt;I get that in circles that love humanities subjects the solution to all issues is ""lets make a movement to change society""

And that's how societies have often changed. Democratic revolutions, women's and minorities' rights, social security etc. If you say that societies rarely change I recommend opening any history book.

&gt;Morals and societies just change, as there is no end goal, which progress implies.

I was referring to scientific progress. 

All in all, once you leave the cult of the individual self-made man, existing in a void of context - believing that everything he is, he has done by himself, everything he believes, he has figured out on his own, were he born as a slave in Ancient Egypt or a shareholder in the Roaring 20's - you'll realize that culture and society creates us as much as we uphold and revision them.",,/r/europe/comments/htxlli/how_to_spot_foreigners_in_finland/fyledx0/,Kween_of_Finland,1595192426

As whole July, new daily SARS-CoV-2 infections averaged about 20, ranging from 10 to 30.

The saga regarding Minister of Interior's ""irrevocable"" resignation continues. On Monday June 30th, Minister of Interior Aleš Hojs announced he and newly appointed Police Director Anton Travner are irrevocably resigning and that Prime Minister Janez Janša has already accepted his resignation (he also thanked Hojs and Travner for their service on Twitter later that day). During previous weekend, investigational police raided Minister of Economy's offices and home due to suspicion of corruption in PPE purchases. Hojs claimed that this investigation is politically motivated and work of ""deep state"" and that he is resigning due to his inability to cleanse the police of politically controlled people. After 7 days, President of National Assembly should be formally notified of resignation, but he wasn't. After being questioned about that, PM said ""You [the journalists] reported I accepted the resignation. I doubt you have record of me ever saying that"". A few days after that he clarified that he [PM] never opened the resignation letter and thus it doesn't hold any importance. Minister of Interior will ""seriously rethink whether he should remain in his position"".

Public debate about new proposed media laws has been extended after criticism that planned 5 days are too little. The laws would, among other things, reduce funding for national broadcaster and set up a new fund for financing of Slovenian television productions, which would be partitioned under Minister of Culture's discretion and would be filled by new payments by network operators. Proponents claim that it brings a long overdue reform of Slovenian media landscape and represents a necessary break with legacy of socialism in Yugoslavia. Opponents claim it means orbanization of Slovenian media.

2011,"Because in the Netherlands you get your VAT deductions on your back account within 2 days of reporting it, last client with turnover in Italy hds to wait a whole year for it. Furthermore, if you as a taxpayer have a defensible position, for example you sell tractors as ‘vehicles’ instead of ‘agricultural tools’ or vice versa and you believe that legally they are vehicles, the tax authorities CANNOT give you a fine. That principle also extend to being able to ask the tax authorities to give a ruling on what the correct tax regime is, before you even go settle your business in NL, then tax authorities are then legally unable to go back on their previous ruling and thus you are certain that the chance of unexpected legal proceedings is 0%. 

If you were fraudulent, and then decide to be a good guy. You pay your taxes that were owed, but you cannot be given a fine either. 

In a lot of countries say for example Belgium, if you make a mistake on your VAT return, government can fine you 300% of the loss VAT you didn’t pay. As we’re talking about tax over TURNOVER instead of profits, 300% of 20-25% of your turnover would instantly bankrupt 50% of all companies. 

Lastly, Netherlands has the most tax treaties out of all countries. Which gives a lot of security and could save a to of time and money arguing with foreign authorities

* An attempt to form a ""coalition of national unity"" in March to combat the Covid-19 crisis had failed. Instead was opted to approve the outgoing caretaker government as a government with full power, leading to the current [Wilmès II government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilm%C3%A8s_II_Government). Wilmès II however is a minority coalition which only has 38 seats out of 150 and has to survive with support from various opposition parties.

* That's why meanwhile our politicians are busy to look for a new, stable, coalition to succeed Wilmès II.

2057,"If we can't find a solution for an issue because there a too many different interests then there are 2 options. 1, don't make a solution as an union. Or 2, try to align those interests so there is an option for a solution.

You have to find all the different interests, know the why and what of every party involved and then try to align those interests. If you start with a country that wants an unlimited supply of money and a country that doesn't want to give anything. You first have to know why a country wants an unlimited supply and why the other doesn't want to give anything.

If you know all these interests then it's easier to make a proposal. And if parties understand each other it will be easier to accept.

But this requeres three things, a lot of time because there are so many parties and a lot of different interests. The will to only give fair interests. And the willingness to listen to and understand each other interests. 

I believe everyone at this point knows the interests and there just need to be an option for a proposal within those interests for a deal.

If there can't be a proposal, well then we just go home and rethink if our points and interests are fair. There might be a moment in the future that a party realises their interests aren't fair for the other party and there will be a new option for a proposal.

And, as I Dutch guy, I fully trust Rutte to only give fair interests of our side and to listen to other people's interests. But they need to be fair, corona also hit our economy hard and there are already enough problems here that need to be solved. We can't solve other countries problems with our money before we solve our own.

What we can do, is help them without harming ourself too much but to do that we need to know all the interests and reasons why help is needed. We need to make sure that an Italian guy pays as much taxes and works as hard as a Dutch guy. And there need to be a fair limit because we don't want to harm ourself too much.

2064,"it litterally shows that italy is however you look at it, one of the biggest contributor to europe, doing way better than most, and being undeniably the better and most important contributor after germany, and proportionally doing better than france. Talking about debt, Italy owns most of it's debt, while this is absolutely not true for other countries. Talking about absolute numbers, Italy is a 60 millions people economy that is worth more than double the economy of a 5 million one, which is mostly based on speculating over finance. 

For the last 30 years italy has been paying on it's interests made up in less than 10 years during the 80s, before the euro was even imagined. We joined Europe and have been constantly taxing our economy to pay off our debt which is mostly owned by us, not other countries. By overtaxing us, we halted our growth while contributing to europe and litterally paying for the 90% of other european countries growth, financing everyone, while pushing our national companies to put their fiscal headquarters in fiscal heavens, all of this because we where undeniably gaining by the european trade union and the safety it can give to all of us, and also because we invested deeply on the european project. Now the Italian government is not asking nor begging for money, we are pushing for a fiscal union in Europe, and asking for the economic evaluation to be done in Europe. The only reason why Netherlands can even remotely pretend they can dictate what internal policies to have in Italy's economy, is because they happen to be both part of Europe. If a 5 million country can bully one of the top 10 economies of the world for internal political agendas, then maybe Italy should leave Europe, and if Italy falls, then it falls France (Italy owns a big chunk of french debt) and then it goes Germany and all Europe.

2094,"&gt; Well the constitution is above normal law, they wouldn't be able to do anything if their decision were not above normal law.

Exactly, but currently that is being done by an unelected, partisan Supreme Court. The Polish judicial reforms want to bring a balance to the court, and balance the power of the 3 branches back. Having an unelected judicial power that is able to be extremely powerful and above the other 2 branches, without any checks is dangerous. 

&gt; We are not speaking about US but poland those two countries have different system. The US suprem court is responsible for the constitution respect. Even with conservative judge designed by Trump this instance still take progressive decision.

I just gave you an example. And progressive judges also make respectable judicial decisions, I am not inherently against them. But currently there is no ''check'', no ''balance'' against them. There should be one, which the judicial reforms are going to introduce.

&gt; Well if a law is against the constitution then it should be changed that's how normal thing works in a democracy and if you put the same law in a different package, it's normal that they block it as well.

A constitution in itself is not required to have a democracy. The UK is a very legit democracy and does not have a written constitution, so your statement is untrue. But even if it were true, the Supreme Court isn't the one who can declare democratic laws unconstitutional. The Constitutional Court has to do that, and the partisan Polish Supreme Court has unlawfully decided that they have that power too. 

&gt; So the justice in China is the same as ours? Everything is under direct control of the politician? The purpose of the justice independence is to be independent from the executive power, of course they have opinion they are not robot.

But the ''struggle'' here is not the judicial vs the executive, but the judicial vs the executive **and** the legislative branches. Judicial activism is a real problem, it has been studied academically as well as politically and sociologically. 

&gt; Such a strong argument, the majority of KRS is named by your parliament how can they be independent from the political party ruling the country?

Being appointed by someone doesn't make them extremely partisan automatically. Just see the US Supreme Court, how many of their decisions go against the government that appointed them. The current old-garde of the Polish judicial system doesn't want democracy in the judicial branch because that will hurt their own power. Let's be honest, who wants to give up power?

&gt; This is the constitution that decides about the balance but you cannot expect to change the balance whitout them having a view on this.

The Constitution of Poland has decided that it is the Constitutional Tribune, not the Supreme Court who decides on matters of constitutionality. So you agree with me that it is wrong for the Supreme Court to contradict the Polish Constitution?

&gt; I'm not saying that the reform is not a necessity I've no right to decide on this topic as it is not my country, but the one from the PiS is weakening your democraty in my opinion.

You have every right to decide on a moral matter. Right is right no matter who says it, wrong is wrong no matter who says it. The one from the PiS is actually strengthening democracy, by increasing the democratization of the judiciary. The people should have a right in deciding who can decide over them (the judges). 

&gt; You may have heard about international treaty, those are more than words.

2096,"Any people would fight if another people were literally ""imported"" onto their land by an occupying power. Look at how most of the European governments and people have reacted over the last 8-10 years over the now approximately 1-2 million refugees that have entered and settled into predominantly the EU (don't forget several hundred thousand refugees have also been refused asylum and sent back).

Those refugees are spread across the EU, not uniformly of course, but still spread out. How much are they in proportion to the local population? Even if we do a huge overestimation and say there was an immigration and settlement of 4 million people (refugees, asylum seekers etc), what is 4 million compared to 440 million people, the population of the EU? Yet there were protests by people and governments about how the local culture will be affected, how they would change the demographics etc. Several national governments and/or regional governments enacted laws to penalise or constrain immigration and immigrants.

The total Jewish population in mandatory Palestine was at 11% in 1920, as opposed to the Muslim population at 78% (Christians at 10% and 1% other religious groups). That 11% had swollen to 31% by 1945, as opposed to 60% Muslim population. All within 25 years!

The argument of the Arabs not accepting Israel has since become moot since most Arab states are now either okay or accepting of a two state solution with pre-1967 borders. What hasn't become moot though, is the return of the refugees, both Palestinian and Israeli back to the land they were displaced from in 1948.

2126,"I wanna write more on this in my post. So this will be short.

The debt-to-GDP ratio grew from 60 percent in 1981 to 91 percent in 1987, at an annual average rate of 5 percent. As the decomposition graph shows, the greatest contribution to the increase in public debt came from interest expenditures, not from the primary deficit.

[Graph](https://imgur.com/a/hoDc1A6)

There is two important things to see here. The 1980-1981 where the government decided that the Bank of Italy would no longer be forced to buy any residual treasury bonds that the market refused to absorb. This meant that monetary financing of fiscal policy would now no longer be an obligation, but at best a voluntary choice of the central bank.

That alone meant that the share of interest rate on that debt was never gonna fall under the 10% of gdp till 1997. If you take 1980 interest rates as a basis point, then that would lead to debt-to-GDP ratio growth of 1.5 percent annualy. In 1987 the Italian debt would stand at 70% and not 91%.

Then there is the 1991 fiscal rebalancing, where primary deficits evaporate but there is also a big interest rate hike leading to large stock-flow adjustment. In those 4 years, debt balloons for another 30%. This is a direct result of joining Maastricht Treaty. Large interest rates from the past, no inflation and austerity politics who destroy growth snowball the debt even further.",Slovenian in Canada,/r/europe/comments/htpvnm/three_decades_of_failed_reforms_in_italy_and_what/fykmnv5/,Joko11,1595177664

&gt;Military dogs to track down CoV-infected
In the future, service dogs of the Austrian Armed Forces will be able to sniff the coronavirus in humans, even if the affected individuals show no symptoms. In the military dog centre Kaisersteinbruch (district Neusiedl am See) a ""trial phase"" is now underway.


&gt;A Belgian shepherd dog is currently being trained as a Corona sniffer in the Military Dog Centre of the Austrian Armed Forces. The training is playful: with the help of scent tubes containing scent molecules of a corona virus, the dog is to be conditioned to the smell. After finding the test object, there is an immediate reward.

&gt;Safety of humans and animals guaranteed
Starting next week, the search for Covid traces will also be done using masks. The safety of humans and animals is guaranteed. Both the tubes and the masks will be treated with UV radiation. The viruses still present are thus neutralized. According to the Austrian Armed Forces, the project is currently in the ""trial phase"".

They are currently in a test phase, said Defence Minister Klaudia Tanner (ÖVP) in a statement. The fact that the service dogs can detect various substances is nothing new, she said. In addition to an explosive detection dog, there are also dogs that can detect explosives or addictive poisons by smell, said Tanner.

Because after the Greek disaster we had a wave of eurosceptic rising everywhere in Europe, and it has already cost us the UK. 

What we're risking now is a European-wide economic crisis, because the major trade partners of everyone in the Union are other Union members. If Italy and Spain tank, so will their trade partners (France, Germany, each other). And then everyone else.

If we don't stabilize the crisis at its early stage, it will grow and affect us all. What Rutte is doing is super short-sighted, it scores him political points at home, but if the UE crumbles the Netherlands are fucked, and he'll still have to pay at the end of the day. But everyone will be worse off the process.

Imagine how big of a hit it would deal to the credibility of the Union with all its members stripped of most of their economical powers (no indiviudal control over their currency, having to borrow money with the European treaties looming over your head and so on).

The point is that fellow European Union Member-States are far more than mere trading partners.

&gt; Backing companies with money, for me personally is out of the question

Be that as it may, every single country is giving out company guarantees or lay-off salary covers of some sort to their own companies. The alternative is a massive unrecoupable loss of in wealth, with people and employees unable to sustain themselves. 

&gt; Especially since many companies don't have any reserves, so that's just bad management. Let them go bankrupt. 

I'm sorry, but what you are proposing is not logical, even from an economic standpoint. This is not a normal situation. In nowhere is an entrepreneur forced to account in his financial plans for the government to force his company to close for several months, generating no profit at all, while being equally forced to pay for salaries. The vast majority of European companies are SMEs the overwhelming majority of which don't have treasury to keep functioning for months on end generating 0 profit while maintaining staff costs. It's just nonsensical.

Without an extraordinary backer like the State for this extraordinary situation, the overwhelming percentage of European companies would disappear. And the social systems in their present form (And the State Finances needed to keep them in their present form) would collapse, leading to far, far more economic loss than the current measures being undertaken by every European government.",Portugal,/r/europe/comments/htxiz7/merkel_and_macron_walk_out_on_rutte_in_eu/fykahcj/,Joltie,1595170989

Interestingly, politics seems to be a universally hated career among them.

This is in stark contrast to everyone who loves money and power - most of them seem to always need more money, more stuff to own, and preferably more people that they can look down and talk down to.

Interesting notion, now imagine you're forced to reduce debt during the good times to the point where your country didn't manage to grow during the good times and it's time for the bad times again and you have others saying you should have prepared by reducing debt during the good times, which you had done, but now you have a brittle economy caused from lack of public investment and high taxes to pay for the debt reduction during the good times. The economic recession caused by the debt reduction has as a side-effect also significantly contributed to push out the active-age tax-paying population to emigrate abroad, which further contributed to reducing your shrinking tax base.

Now it's time for the bad times and unfortunately while you managed to reduce the debt volume, your country's debt-to-GDP still continues substantially above pre-crisis levels, and your country has barely grown (In Greece, it's still below 2008 levels) and is in worse condition to cushion this far more substantial crisis than the one before. As such, all the debt reducing you does nothing for you except rebukes of lack of preparedness of your finances for the crisis, so you now need to borrow even more and you are going to be in a far worse financial situation than at the beginning of the first crisis.

Everyone agrees that Italy, Spain and other countries which have been hit hard need help. But Italy has been a cause of economic concerns for years. Very slow growth, a public debt double the amount allowed under EU rules, the yearly budget deficits which the EU disapproves and the Italian government subsequently ignores, a terrible tax discipline with an informal economy consisting of almost 25% GDP, a populist government that isn't willing to take impopular measures to reform its antiquated labor market and its pensionsystem.

Now there's an incredible large pot of FREE money being formed and the Italians basically say: don't worry, give us access to these funds and all these problems will be addressed. 

I don't think it's unreasonable at all that the Dutch want some sort of oversight on the distribution on these funds, since the Italian government has objectively a bad track record when it comes to reforms.

2507,"Last time we had housing-related problems the whole world had economic crisis for several years, millions of people lost their jobs, governments fell, there was unrest and political changes, even some wars (you could argue most of them were unrelated - I would argue oil prices are ALWAYS related to wars).

Some countries still haven't recovered 12 years later.

Last time there was a few millions of people migrating to Europe we had another crisis, with similar effects.

If the climate change continues at its current pace (that's optimistic - the prognosis is that it will accelerate, but let's assume it won't) - in a few decades hundreds of millions of people will lose their houses (how do you think banking sector reacts to millions of mortgages lost in a few years?) and will likely migrate(3 millions imigrant were apparently too much for EU - how about 300 millions?).

Building hundreds of millions of fancy floating houses in 30 years isn't free, it turns out.

And that ignores all the other effects - like the fact that some places in India and Pakistan will get too hot to go outside for more than a few minutes. Not because it's uncomfortable (it already gets to 50 C there sometimes), but becaue it kills you. When the outside ""wet thermometer temperature"" is above 36 C - people can't cool by sweating. So they overheat and die. No matter how healthy you are - it just takes more or less time.

So I don't think people will continue to live there. Add another millions of migrants.

Then there's more extremes - parts of the world that are dry will get more dry. Parts of the world that are wet will get more wet. Hurricanes and floods and sand storms will get stronger.

That's going to force people to change where they grow food (and that aint free either). And it's going to force a lot of people to migrate again.

Yes you can deal with all of that with current technology. But are millions of people in the poor overpopulated countries going to have money to do that? I highly doubt it.

So they will migrate - and as we recently found out - people in rich countries aren't happy when millions of immigrants from poor countries show up.",Poland,/r/europe/comments/htufyu/floating_houses_immune_to_rising_sea_levels_in/fyjkg40/,ajuc,1595148869

2510,"So let me get this straight. There's the European Economic Area -- which has the explicit purpose of granting nations access to the European market without heftier commitments to the EU, but there's also the EU which, by your description is the same thing.

Despite that, before the EU was the EU, we had the European Economic Community, but then added a light political structure to it (one example being the increased European Commission), we had the European Constitution which after only two states voted against was ratified into the Lisbon Treaty (which got unanimous agreement) and added a larger political structure (one example of these newly empowered being the European Parliament).

So the EU is JUST a trade union but inexplicably added an unnecessary political structure and changed its trade-focused title.

We created a united currency which is used by most EU states and we also have PESCO which has the aim of centralising and simplifying EU military command structure. The EU also has several military foreign training programs and one military operation in the for of Atalanta.

Trade Unions and their military centralisation, amirite?

So you're telling me that the EEC became the EU, has been increasingly adding to its political structure so that it resembles that of a nation-state and even has military programs, despite the fact that we could just use NATO if the purpose wasn't an ""ever close union"" but that isn't the objective.

I also love the strawman at the end. I guess by wanting Catalonia to stay in Spain, I must be some fringe anti-catalonian extremist. Not someone that loves my country but also loves the idea that we can be a major power if we work together.

2661," &gt;According to the Financial Times, another major problem of the LMU was that it failed to outlaw the printing of paper money based on the bimetallic currency. France and Italy exploited this weakness by printing banknotes to fund their own endeavours, effectively ""forcing other members of the union to bear some of the cost of its fiscal extravagance by issuing notes backed by their currency"".[15] According to the BBC, Greece with its ""chronically weak economy meant successive Greek governments responded by decreasing the amount of gold in their coins,[b] thereby debasing their currency in relation to those of other nations in the union and in violation of the original agreement"". Greece was formally expelled from the Latin Monetary Union in 1908. It was readmitted in 1910, however.[17]

But if you read Mark 14 and then about the trial in the beginning of 15, you clearly see that the priests where the accusers, while the Romans are merely assisting the locals.


Jesus Before the Sanhedrin

53 They took Jesus to the high priest, and all the chief priests, the elders and the teachers of the law came together. 54 Peter followed him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest. There he sat with the guards and warmed himself at the fire.

55 The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death, but they did not find any. 56 Many testified falsely against him, but their statements did not agree.

57 Then some stood up and gave this false testimony against him: 58 “We heard him say, ‘I will destroy this temple made with human hands and in three days will build another, not made with hands.’” 59 Yet even then their testimony did not agree.

60 Then the high priest stood up before them and asked Jesus, “Are you not going to answer? What is this testimony that these men are bringing against you?” 61 But Jesus remained silent and gave no answer.

Again the high priest asked him, “Are you the Messiah, the Son of the Blessed One?”

62 “I am,” said Jesus. “And you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven.”

*63 The high priest tore his clothes. “Why do we need any more witnesses?” he asked. 64 “You have heard the blasphemy. What do you think?”*

They all condemned him as worthy of death. 65 Then some began to spit at him; they blindfolded him, struck him with their fists, and said, “Prophesy!” And the guards took him and beat him.

Jesus Before Pilate(A)

15 Very early in the morning, the chief priests, with the elders, the teachers of the law(B) and the whole Sanhedrin,(C) made their plans. So they bound Jesus, led him away and handed him over to Pilate.(D)

2 “Are you the king of the Jews?”(E) asked Pilate.

“You have said so,” Jesus replied.

3 The chief priests accused him of many things. 4 So again Pilate asked him, “Aren’t you going to answer? See how many things they are accusing you of.”

5 But Jesus still made no reply,(F) and Pilate was amazed.

6 Now it was the custom at the festival to release a prisoner whom the people requested. 7 A man called Barabbas was in prison with the insurrectionists who had committed murder in the uprising. 8 The crowd came up and asked Pilate to do for them what he usually did.

9 “Do you want me to release to you the king of the Jews?”(G) asked Pilate, 10 knowing it was out of self-interest that the chief priests had handed Jesus over to him. 11 But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have Pilate release Barabbas(H) instead.

12 “What shall I do, then, with the one you call the king of the Jews?” Pilate asked them.

13 “Crucify him!” they shouted.

14 “Why? What crime has he committed?” asked Pilate.

But they shouted all the louder, “Crucify him!”

15 Wanting to satisfy the crowd, Pilate released Barabbas to them. He had Jesus flogged,(I) and handed him over to be crucified",Norway,/r/europe/comments/htgw0e/farleft_french_politician_accuses_jews_of_deicide/fyj7pgi/,Scorchio451,1595136348

This scene is immortalized by the excellent performance of Peter Usinov in Quo Vadis (1951 movie).

It is almost certainly false. Nero in fact made a lot of efforts to save the city during the event, sending his personal guard to help the firefighters, opening his private gardens to shelter people who lost their home, etc.

Of course, after this, the general population was extremely discontent, and some started to accuse the emperor (the idea that Nero started it already originated at that moment), so he tried to find a good scapegoat to put the blame on.

So, first of all, was Poland liberation from Hitler a feasable outcome?

Turning point for WWII was 1938, when England and France given away Czechoslovakia to Hitler. That act demonstrated unwillingness to stop fascism or even indulging it. Poland as you know was eager to snatch a piece too.

USSR was never ally of Hitler's Germany. The pact signed by Molotov is a non-aggression pact. Just the same kind of treaty Poland had signed with Hitler itself few years before.

After Hitler invaded Poland France and British Empire once again did nothing. They've backstabbed Poland by breaking Anglo-Polish military **alliance** signed earlier in 1939. That alliance was the basis of Poland defence strategy - and it never did came true.

People praise mask usage pointing at East Asia but that's also a case of correlation rather than causation.

And you can never enforce a 100% implementation even if it's legislated for, that's just being entirely unrealistic.

While one thing the science DOES prove and there's widespread consensus on is that social distancing has a huge impact on spread. The argument in Nordic countries is that the latter impacts the former - that is, enforcing mask usage will lead to people being more lax when it comes to social distancing since it lulls people into a false sense of security.

The similarities go beyond the imitate border regions. Those regions are not influenced by Austrians and less German, they
are just the way they are because of the shared origin of Austrian and Bavarian culture. 

There are just so many things which just stand out for me, for example those crucifixes on the road, I just googled them and it turns out they are even called the same, ""materl"" maybe you can confirm that with your insider knowledge...

There is just so much more: the architecture, the surnames. 

The problem with lifestyle, is that is harder to measure any difference and similarities. You can feel it, but it is just to quantify. The best approach would be to have some kind of poll with a ton of questions and get a large group of people to fill them out. 

To look at other factors which don't involve how people feel so much is just much easier and this is why they are mostly used to study differences and similarities in people. This is just the way it is done, as I said much easier to quantify. 

I would bet a bottle of almdudler, that if you would ask Czechs if Austrians are similar to them or similar or to Germans they would say Germans...

All of the symbols of what some would call 'toxic' masculinity were missing, and I thought it seemed to create a far more egalitarian society.  Far more sharing of family duties.. less ridiculous attempt to shout ""look at me' through extreme clothing, cars or obnoxious music.      It was quite noticeable, and firmed up what I had already thought about the issue.

The only guys I saw hanging out being ""bros"" with the gold chains and music etc etc... were all quite obviously not of Dutch background.   This also seemed more specific to NL, and did not seem to be to the same extent as you moved towards Germany or France, Spain or Italy... obviously.   It was about the only thing I could put my finger on that was quite different between NL and it's neighbors.

People obviously cared about their outward appearance, but they seemed to not have the same need to express their personalities overtly.  eg in another countries where curtains were not a thing.... it would be a very different result lol

It also does not help.. I returned home with my Gazelle, only to find the worst bike infrastructure ever....  and after checking out local museums and galleries for the first time in a long time (after immersing myself in the EU), we have taken to calling our current home a cultural wasteland, unless you consider football a core cultural value... which I do not.

I had a conservatorie down the road and an opera singer one one side, a flautist on the other.     The only thing people in my area seem to tune is their beloved petrol guzzlers.

2974,"Turkey's eastern province of Van has been the first stop for refugees from Iran and Afghanistan for a long time.

Some of these refugees have been waiting in Van for years until their asylum application is accepted by a third country. I know babies that have grown up during these waiting years.

An Iranian refugee who spoke at a symposium on international migration organised by the United Nations 12 years ago, where I was one of the speakers, said that she had been waiting for her asylum request to be accepted by a third country for 11 years, away from her family.

Back then, the city was full of refugees expecting to settle in another country. But they had to start a new life in Turkey since the asylum process is a running battle.

Van is gradually becoming a refugee graveyard.

A boat, believed to have been carrying 60 to 100 migrants from Afghanistan and Pakistan, [capsized](https://ahvalnews.com/migrants/five-bodies-recovered-after-migrant-boat-sinks-turkish-lake) in Lake Van in stormy weather on June 27. Search-and-rescue teams [located the wreckage](https://ahvalnews.com/migrants/turkish-rescuers-find-wreck-missing-migrant-boat-eastern-lake) just last week. Since then, dead bodies have been coming ashore. Officials have discovered 37 bodies so far. Search-and-rescue teams continue their efforts.

As far as we learn from the news, smugglers chose to [cross the lake](https://ahvalnews.com/migrant-crisis/turkey-detains-eight-smugglers-after-raiding-ship-carrying-over-250-migrants) to avoid police and military checkpoints located along traditional transit routes used to traffic migrants into Turkey from Iran, especially to bypass the one in the Reşadiye district.

There is no checkpoint after Reşadiye. From there, refugees walk nearly 30 km to the bus terminal in the Tatvan district of the neighbouring Bitlis province. From there, they go to Istanbul by bus to find a job.

Refugees freeze to death in the bitter cold during winter while they are trying to cross the border. When the snow melts, their bodies appear. Especially in Çaldıran, Özalp and Başkale districts, authorities find bodies of refugees shredded by animals.

So, how has Van turned into a death pit?

The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) had an office in Van for many years. Having an office where they could access the asylum procedure was very valuable for refugees arriving in Van. Refugee status determination was carried out in Van, the province was not a way of death for refugees but a solution centre.

Unfortunately, nine years ago, the U.N. closed the office and left the majority of tasks to the Turkish state. Thus, the refugees reaching Van from Turkey's eastern border lack access to an effective asylum procedure. In a sense, they are now doomed to uncertainty. For this reason, they try to reach Istanbul or European countries through irregular ways by risking their lives.

Border control has also been tightened in recent years. Despite the so-called border checks, hundreds of refugees can cross these borders every month, often in bulk.

Mahmut Kaçan, a lawyer from the Van Bar Association who has been working with these refugees for many years, said this was baffling.

“On one hand, there is increased border security with cameras and soldiers all around, but many refugees can enter Turkey,” Kaçan said. “Refugees enter Van through two spots, Çaldıran and Başkale, authorities even know the border villages that refugees have access to. There is a problem if so many people can cross the border freely. There is neglect, encouragement and impunity. It is clear that there is corruption at the border.”

Another Van resident I met spoke of the same thing. “How can so many refugees cross the border despite several drones and cameras?"" they asked. ""There is a human trafficking network here. We need to reveal it.”

The families of refugees in the capsized boat were looking forward to hearing from their children, siblings, fathers and mothers. Many now hope the Turkish authorities find dead bodies of their loved ones.

There are things that could be done to prevent these horrible deaths from happening again.

Refugees die in Van, either by freezing to death or drowning in the lake. The responsibility falls to the relevant institutions and international organisations in Turkey, especially the U.N. Let's solve these problems together.

Van should not be a place of death for refugees, but a place of hope to start a new life.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/htskah/how_did_turkeys_eastern_province_of_van_become_a/fyipwhw/,harrisinpc,1595123669

As for the reasons that Southern countries are declining, did you look at:

\- The share of money going to pensions vs the EU mean compared to the share going to R&amp;D?

\- The lower results in education (PISA, early school leaving rate) and less selective immigration policies and the resulting per capita difference in skills?

\- Poor investment decisions (the AVE network in Spain should have like 3-4 lines, not more)

I think that Southern Europe should be free to decide, but leaving the Euro would result in them being shut out of the global credit markets, Argentina-style, while the chronic issues they face would still be there.

And until the thing came quite political(around 2018-2019), the German government had the same stance it was just an economic project.
Many countries had the same influence to stop NS2 than Germany had. Finnland had various chances. 

Also the EU also condemmed the sanctions, were Germany is alone the minority. 


I'm again EU not speaking up against the sanctions, as NS2 is economical non-sense(even before delay and the German regulator forced into EU law), enviromental damaging and not needed. I'm against it. A reason I'm against the argument is needed for Energy security as our most renown Economic Institute(DIW) disproven that already.

&gt;Such as it being more improtant that children are protected and grow up to be reasonable people, which is the point indeed.

As of now sex education is banned in all of Poland, so children are not protected at all. It was better before whole conflict began, but because there was no dialogue, situation got much worse. 

&gt;If people being educated causes the destruction of a democracy, that country never had a democracy.

No, conflict destroyed democracy. Education have nothing to do with it. Because our society is so polrized, politicians who absolutely shouldn't be politicians, gain a lot of support, and aslowly corrupted whole system form inside. 

&gt;That's not possible because it's a black or white issue. Either you have LGBT-free zomes like Saudi Arabia or you don't.

Comparing situation in Poland to Saudi Arabia is stupid af. Here nothing is white or black. Situation is difficult and there need to be solutions, but politicians gain a lot from conflicts. 

&gt;Progress allows a society to grow. Regress, however, does not.

Progress can be achieved by dialogue and cooperation. Conflicts mostly lead to regress. 

&gt;Of course it matters to those oppressed, do you have empathie at all?

Well, personally I don't feel oppressed, but I know many do. What I meant you can't suddenly change mind of millions of people, that simply won't happen. You should talk to them though, go to a compromise, even though there are wrong. Fighting them won't bring anything good. With time their mind set will eventually change. In meantime it is possible to create environment for everyone. 

&gt;There is no dialogue to be had about ""should there be LGBT shelters for when they're victimized?"". There is no middle ground, it's a yes or no question.

Why should only LGBT community should get a shelter? What about victims of domestic violence? What about youth addicted to drugs? What about religious, national or ethnic minorities? What about all people who feel threatened? There is no middle ground because nobody is looking for it. Why not creating shelter for everyone? 

&gt;As it stands Poland is facing what countless other countries have faced. None of it is in any form unique or new. It's tired and it's old.

3085,"I told you I'm in favour of eurobonds. I'm also in favour of a more left leaning direction in the future. For example, I personally think the recent minimum wage boost of over 20% in Spain was a good idea.

I specifically pointed out I'm not here to defend austerity. As an Austrian I'm on Spain's side in this debate, not on Austria's.

However, don't hold the EU responsible for a crisis it didn't cause (not even remotely). The housing bubble in Spain, the Lehman brothers crash, the global recession in 07/08... none of that was the EU's fault. And subsequent eurocrisis was partially caused by speculation against the euro (see also the role of speculation during black Wednesday and the downfall of the pound sterling) but also partially by design. Continuous downvaluing of one's currency can not be a recipy for lasting growth. We have to boost productivity all over Europe but especially in the south. The only point in which I diverge is *how* that productivity was achieved. Austerity is an antisocial and dehumanizing tool that was naturally embraced by the far too powerful EPP (Europe's republicans). It helped Spain (whether you want to accept it or not) but it came at a high cost and I repeat: I'm not here to defend those measures because I fundamentally *agree* with you that they were wrong.

The answer to this conundrum - in my humble opinion - is getting our act together. The north has to admit that this current system is not sustainable and we do need a fiscal union. Countries like Germany also need to understand that being an export champion looks great on paper, but is neither helping their own population (which is increasingly too poor to stimulate their own economy hence the German obsession with exports) nor is it a sustainable model for the world economy (every export market needs an import market, we can't all become a Germany).

However, southern Europe has to finally get over themselves and accept that whatever the fuck you guys did *before* joining the euro was pretty much a complete clusterfuck as well. How long do you think downvaluing the Drachma, the Lira, the Peseta... would have worked? We can always look at South America to see how their economies have developed since you entered the euro and what do we see? Stagflation. All across the continent. It just doesn't work. We need productivity growth. And a shared currency is a great way to boost productivity believe it or not.

Now we can also enter into some sort of meta analysis and debate whether productivity growth is really the right course of action and whether we should overthink our current capitalist system (we should), but we're not currently in the position to do so. We aren't even close to anything like that. So for now we have to play according to the system's rules and the only way we will be able to do that while continuously enjoying our (way above average) worker and environmental protections in Europe - yeah both in Austria AND in Spain - is to operate from within our own semi-protectionist geopolitic sphere of influence. Which is the EU.

Is this nuanced and empathetic enough for you? I will say it once more but this will be the last time: I personally do not condone the austerity measures in enforced in southern Europe during and after the recent economic crisis. I consider austerity immoral, dangerous and potentially not very effective. However, it *can work* as a short time measure when productivity is boosted and the country manages to implement structural reforms in the time that was bought through austerity. It is dishonest and short sighted to blame the European Union for this crisis or even the handling of it. It is *partially* to blame, but not even close to the main actors that caused this - which were American dominance and deregulation in the finance sector, southern European idleness on reforms, the lack of a fiscal union for euro countries and political extremists on both sides trying to hijack this discussion and making it about things it shouldn't be - exactly in that order.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/hthd7l/my_opinion_on_the_eu_as_a_southern_european/fyhvyvi/,hertenstein,1595105635

3100,"&gt; At least 60,000 rounds of ammunition have been unaccounted for in the German military and police force over the past 10 years.

Frankly, this doesn't seem like a very big deal to me.

https://www.bulkammo.com/rifle/bulk-5.56x45-ammo

Based on that, it's something like $600 for a box of 1000 rounds of 5.56 rifle ammunition, which I'm assuming what they're talking about.  So you're averaging maybe $3600 in ammo a year that isn't accounted for.

In terms of money, that doesn't seem like worth throwing a lot of auditing effort at.

In terms of trying to control who has access to ammunition for security reasons, I will bet that (a) the black market for ammunition in Germany is a hell of a lot bigger than $3600/year and that (b) the legal private market for ammunition in Germany is a hell of a lot bigger than $3600/year and that that ammunition isn't audited for loss like that.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/htmuzf/germany_missing_ammunition_raises_alarm/fyhw69p/,duisThias,1595105750

This is their eastern neigbour: https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/hssti6/the_image_of_poland_in_russia_through_the_prism/

There is no finding a common ground with Russia for us, it's not  possible, because they think we are/should be their buffer zone. It's impossible to find a common ground/understanding with a country that has so fundamentally different interests.

It's another thing for Germany, because your and their fundamental interests do not directly clash. They are in an opposition mostly, but they do not clash directly, so you have a space for a discussion with them.

We don't have this possibility. So please stop calling the Poles paranoid because of this. Russia is a real security threat to them. And they can't fix that by being more reasonable or appeasing towards Russia, because Russians simply live in an alternative version of history, they haven't changed since the fall of the USSR, they are simply just weaker.

That Poland is antagonizing Western Europe needlessly is unfortunate, but I do not count their position on NS2 as a part of these antagonizing actions. The other actions you mentioned - yes, I think those are unfortunate.

But evidently, Poland has a stronger faith in the US over you or other Western European countries, an assesment that to be honest isn't really that unreasonable.

And also, Poland is a big enough country to want to play a sort of regional middle power, I don't think they want to have their security solely relying on alliances.

More so, I think there is a general scepticism in EE about western sympaties being a sufficient security guarantee. I mean let's say our domestic political regimes are fully alligned with yours, we have the same values, we don't ever antagonize you...well, this was pretty much the Czechoslovak relations with France and the UK in the 30s. We were quite literaly the last liberal democracy in our region, modeled after the French/British example, we had nonproblematic relations with them and in the end, it did fuck all for us. They quite literaly went to sign a deal with Hitler about our territory without even inviting us to the table.

So while I wish to have good relations with all Western European countries, I don't dellude myself, and Poles probably don't dellude themselves either, that this somehow guarantees that you will like us, or will like us enough to put yourselves in danger for us.

3176,"If you are at risk (old, sick, lowered immune defense system...) then sure. Wearing a mask is maybe a good idea, but in Denmark I know there are people with those added risks that still self isolate and are paid normal (or sick pay) to simply stay at home. 

In the general population though the conclusions from the Danish experts is masks is only a tiny limited extra protection and with the low infection rates negligible compared to social distancing and limited crowd. Music festivals, concerts, spectator sports are still restricted and public condemnation for those breaking these distancing rules are very loud. 

You can disagree with those experts, but the evidence in Denmark from these past months back them up. 

As has been seen numerous times there is a correct and a wrong way to use masks, so stupidity and ignorance is maybe a greater problem than cost. My company has a locker with masks, and if the workers want, they can take, but no one is taking them. 

Most of Denmark is practically corona free. The majority of infections early on was ski vacation nuts returning home from Italy, Southern Germany, Switzerland, France... They infected families, coworkers and random strangers they encountered. So we had pockets of high contamination but not a wide spread epidemic. Social distancing, public sector lock down, no traveling, no visiting other cities or regions, close restaurants, close bars and entertainments, no large crowds, shut down schools, universities and sports facilities.... That all stopped the spread far more effective than sick people with masks ever could. 

PS by large crowds the initial ban was maximum 10 people and preferable keep it in the family. My company never shut down and it happened to only have 10 employees. If there had been 11 we would have needed to take breaks in shifts. With 10 there was room enough to keep one empty chair on either side during breaks. 

That is why no masks worked in Denmark. The government said what they wanted and the population implemented it no questions asked.",Denmark,/r/europe/comments/htil0t/how_often_have_you_worn_a_facemask_outside_your/fyhxy1b/,Econ_Orc,1595106757

There was quite literally an ethnic cleansing of the North of Cyprus by Turkish troops. It is incredibly easy to prove, here.

Turkey was found guilty by the European Commission of Human Rights  for displacement of persons, deprivation of liberty, ill treatment,  deprivation of life and deprivation of possessions.

3203,"Funny  you say that because according to research of Center for Research on Prejudice(part of warsaw univeristy) oposition voters are more hateful, are more likely dehumanize PiS voters, ironically they feel more attacked and dehumanized when its actually other way around, whats more they trust PiS voters less then PiS voters trust them and are less willing to interact with them, so no oposition voters arent the more tolerant ones, oposite actually.

You are litereal example of intolerance, you are dehumanizing other side by calling your side the normal ones, implying other side is abnormal.

You claim they are lazy but did you think that maybe they have problem finding job(highest unemplyment) because eastern part of Poland lacks development, poor infrastructure and  lack of investment, and its not like they didnt try to do something about it, they DID but got sabotaged by guess who....PO, I am talking about via carpathia project:

Highway going from Lithuania, through eastern Poland(least developed regions), through slovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and eventually ends up in Greek port city of Thessaloniki. Also in Romania there would be fork toward to the Black Sea port town of Constanta.

I would say that this highway can have very important role in the region seeing how it would connect Baltic sea, Black sea and Aegean Sea, it can bring significant investment toward eastern Poland.

So what happen was that someone from eastern poland made a petition to try to get funds from EU for this project, trying to get it add to EU TEN-T(Trans-European Transport Network), EU agreed to send someone check viability of this project. so everything was going well but here is where the PO sabotaged it, PO MEP's requested this petition to be closed, claiming that this highway is not needed and that this region is already getting enough money, which is a total BS seeing how its least developed region with highest unemployment.

The most fucked up thing is that it was happening when PO was ruling party, its pretty screwed up when your own goverment is putting effort to keep least developed region of your country from being more developed, they really screwed over people from rural areas here, and now people are wondering why that region dont want to vote for candidate of political party that screwed them over like this...",,/r/europe/comments/hqakh0/poland_divided_yet_again_in_the_elections/fyhjppk/,Culaio,1595098874

3228,"You know, there have been a few high-profile scandals in the EU where regulators arguably didn't clamp down as hard as they should in various ways.

* Mad cow outbreak, where the British regulators were responsible for approving the beef in question.

* Dieselgate, where German regulators were responsible for approving emissions.

* Now this.

We won't know the details until someone's chewed through all of this, but I've commented before that there are some fundamental conflicts of interest posed by situations where you have a government belonging to only a small part of a market responsible for approving things for that market.  Like, say I'm a German regulator.  There's a big, important German company.  Germany's economy would benefit if this company does well.  But...my say-so is also what's required for this to have access to the market as a whole.

I've pondered before on here that this structure seems fundamentally prone to [regulatory capture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capture).

Heh, just noticed that Wikipedia even talks about this happening in federal governments.  Except there, it's just talking about the lesser issue of the state becoming an advocate for the industry and then trying to argue for it legislatively at the federal level, whereas in the current EU confederal structure, state-level regulators have control of the levers directly -- they don't need to just try to argue to someone else.

&gt;There is substantial academic literature suggesting that smaller government units are easier for small, concentrated industries to capture than large ones. For example, a group of states or provinces with a large timber industry might have their legislature and/or their delegation to the national legislature captured by lumber companies. These states or provinces then becomes the voice of the industry, even to the point of blocking national policies that would be preferred by the majority across the whole federation.

3300,"Ah, the classic south rich north poor. A northerner wouldnt survive 2 months with REAL spaniard salary (1000€ before taxes). Thats why we bloody emigrate north to be treated as a second class citizen.

Spain economy was hit harder because of its composition, not because of fiscal imbalances in the previous years. Spain had a surplus in the years prior to the crisis and the debt was 35% in 2007 and rapidly down.

During the crisis the debt as % of the GDP grew a lot because the strong contraction of the economy caused a huge deficit, which increased the debt. Because we are talking about debt as % GDP, then the loss of GDP is almost counted twice.

That is why austerity policies do not always work for all cases. To reduce the ratio of debt to GDP is much better to increase the GDP than try to cut around the corners for to reduce the debt.

The best example is the USA: Obama pumped billions of dollars into the economy and it has been growing much faster, sometimes twice as much, as the EU in the last decade, despite being the epicenter of the 2008 crisis.

A country is not a household, yet so many people try to apply microeconomics policies to a macroeconomic problem.

&amp;#x200B;

AND YET, this is all besides the point, because we are talking about the covid 19 crisis is not caused nor is it a consequence of the 2008 crisis. Any country hit with the virulence of Italy or Spain, that had to shut down the entire economy for months, would be in the same situation.

German economy is predicted to contract 9% in the Q2, would you say that it is because of their lack of fiscal balance?

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: This is just an example of the difference in the impact on the economy.

Dutch deficit in 2007 vs in 2009: -0.1% vs  -5.10%

Spanish deficit in 2007 vs in 2009: +1.9% vs -11.28%

You cannot compare the response because the crisis were completely different in scale. Sacrifices have been painfully made in Spain since then, that is how the deficit of -11.28% has been reduced to -2.5% while the economy has been contracting for many of those years and the unemployment skyrocketed ( both due to the lack of demand due to the lack of stimuli due to the enforcement of austerity, but that is another topic).

On top of that, Spain was also a victim of the 2011 crisis (which it could not avoid, because Spain doesn't have monetary tools, as they belong exclusively to the BCE), which destroyed all the progress done in 2010. The deficit went -11.28% to -9.53% back to -10.74%. Meanwhile, the Netherlands did not suffer this crisis, and went from -5.10% down to -5.20% and then up to -4.40%.

The context is important to understand the current situation and prevent false stereotypes from taking over.

Was austerity in the middle of a financial crisis the most brilliant idea? No, but it was the only solution given to Spain and we went through it, so don't try to gain the moral ground stating that the Dutch people have suffered a lot of cuts, as if Spain hasn't done many more sacrifices.",,/r/europe/comments/hthp5r/dutch_welcome_new_ideas_on_eu_recovery_fund_but/fyh61z0/,Pinguaro,1595091416

3304,"PARIS—French authorities opened an investigation into arson after a fire broke out Saturday in a cathedral in the western city of Nantes.

The fire damaged precious artifacts in the Cathedral of Saint Peter and Saint Paul and destroyed part of the cathedral’s stained glass window. Images of black smoke billowing out of the 15th-century facade immediately prompted comparisons to the fire that engulfed Notre Dame cathedral in Paris last year.


“After Notre-Dame, the Saint-Pierre-et-Saint-Paul cathedral, in the heart of Nantes, is burning,” President Emmanuel Macron wrote on Twitter.

“Support to our firefighters who are taking all the risks to save this Gothic jewel in the City of Dukes.”

Pierre Sennès, the prosecutor in Nantes, said that fires had started in three places in the cathedral, prompting an investigation that will be conducted by regional police services.

“It is too early to draw conclusions,” Mr. Sennès said, adding that a fire expert was on his way from Paris to further investigate.

It took 104 firefighters three hours to contain the fire, which was signaled to emergency services at 7:45 a.m. by passersby who saw flames leaping behind the facade of the cathedral, said Laurent Ferlay, the director of the regional fire department.

Mr. Ferlay said the fire had slightly threatened the stability of the building and that firefighters were working on putting down “residual fires” in the cathedral but would have to rely on the help of a private company to access the remains of the main one.

Yet, he stressed that the fire was much less destructive than the one that tore through Notre Dame last year, bringing down the spire and parts of the roof. Mr. Macron announced earlier this month that the spire would be restored to its 19th-century self.

“We’re not in a Notre-Dame-de-Paris scenario,” Mr. Ferlay said, adding that the roof of Nantes’ cathedral was rebuilt with concrete after it was destroyed in a 1972 fire, which spared it from the flames on Saturday.

The roof of Notre Dame was made mostly of lead, supported by a web of centuries-old—and highly flammable—wooden beams.

“Today, all Nantais and Nantaises are in this emotion, this sadness,” mayor of Nantes Johanna Rolland said. “It’s a place for all Nantais, a part of our history.”

The immediate focus was on saving furniture and works of art inside the cathedral, the mayor’s office said.


The Nantes diocese said that a 1620 grand organ was destroyed, as well as 15th-century stained glass windows, parts of the choir and a smaller organ.

While it doesn’t have the same cultural significance as Notre Dame of Paris, the Cathedral of Saint Peter and Saint Paul is considered an architectural landmark.

Built in the Gothic style in fits and starts between the 15th and 19th centuries, the cathedral has had a tumultuous history. Bombings during World War II damaged the cathedral’s apse and three chapels.

In 1972, an accidental fire sparked by a blowtorch left by a worker on the roof ravaged the building’s wooden framework, leading to more than three decades of repair works in several phases completed in 2008.


The area in front of the cathedral was roped off and firefighters were still on site by midafternoon.

Prime Minister Jean Castex toured the cathedral in Nantes later in the day, alongside Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin and Culture Minister Roselyne Bachelot.

In 2015, the Saint-Donatien basilica in Nantes was partly destroyed after a blaze broke out on the roof, where work was being carried out.

Yes but the difference between ISIS and Artsakh is that ISIS was terrorist group. They tortured and killed civilians, beheaded journalists, and committed countless crimes against humanity. They were, simply put, the worst of humanity. Also, the majority of the people they ruled over despised them.

Meanwhile, Artsakh desires independence from Azerbaijan, a country which has massacred Armenians and celebrated those massacres. Artsakh also hasn't committed crimes against humanity.

3334,"And who is in power is entirely dependent on which cultures make up the majority of that country, thus bypassing the opinions of the minority cultures within that country.

The example I made is not dependent on the modern world map, it's an analogy. The point is that when a regional minority culture exists within the borders of a state controlled by a majority culture, the minority loses their right as their opinions are overwhelmed within the democracy of said country.

I believe fundamentally that the people should be sovereign, and that the ways in which we think and the ways in which we live are determined by the cultural environment we grow up in. Therefore, the foundation of any just democracy needs to be the nations of said country, which all need to agree with the country as a whole. If they do not, the nations should individually have the right to constitute a state that IS representative of them.

You're not providing me with any moral justification for your views. Why do Dutchmen have the right to the Netherlands, but regional minorities do not have right to their land?

In other countries it is clear - usually 2 negative tests and you are considered as recovered and won’t be counted as a Covid19 casualty later. But those countries inform about recoveries vs active cases. The choice of not counting or not counting publicly, made by the UK, Spain, Sweden and Netherlands only (per https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) is causing challenges with numbers in those countries. In the UK it’s supposed over-counting, in Spain many say it is undercounting, even during the official memorial a higher number was used than the official one. Sweden’s numbers are also a mess.

It’s being embezzled and wasted at every level. Many institutions need to be burned down and rebooted. Many politicians need to be rooted out and replaced.

These are a good *start.* The major issues in Spain and Italy are an over-reliance on primary manufacturing. Huge efforts need to be expended to steer the economy towards a modern service based economy. That means encouraging growth industries like software and technology. There are limitless ways to achieve this, and they have many obstacles.

Edit: surprised, was really wondering what was a reasonable amount to start the discussion with from a ""frugals"" pov and always thought that it would be settled with 400 grants 300 loans (limiting both the total amount and the ratio grants /loans) when things got max in favor of the frugals... i know a bold opening move might sometimes work but this is ""surprising""and i am strongly on the frugal side..

3375,"I share your opinion of course, but the pressure for this change has to come from the men’s side. Women groups have made it clear that they will fight it tooth and nail as long as women carry the brunt of unpaid care work (kids and adults). In Switzerland, 8.7 of 16 bn hours a year are provided for free, 2/3 of it by women. See [here](https://www.ebg.admin.ch/dam/ebg/de/dokumente/care/anerkennung_und_aufwertungdercare-arbeit.pdf.download.pdf/anerkennung_und_aufwertungdercare-arbeit.pdf) .

Obviously, this a political argument and not an argument for equality, since two injustices don’t make each other right. Women know this but from the women’s point of view, because of the sheer volume of hours the joke would be on them. A conscription would not amount to more equality, but to more unjustice to them since they are already working much more for for free than men. Why should they agree to further unpaid work when noone wants to pay the hours they already spend collectively wiping grandpa’s and the kids’ ass? 

Again, this does not invalidate your point. As you justly point out, the Swiss army provides services that benefit the civilian public using unpaid people aka slave labor. If women have to serve and it is considered slave labor, it is much more difficult for the state to explain why it is not slavery when they do so - or any person, male or female - in an unorganized and private environment.

So the current situation suits the state very well: it allows to play men and women and the injustices they experience against each other and locks them in a stalemate, *while the state profits from it and pays none of us*. But I am sure the change will come.

Edit to clarify: If the question was to abolish conscription, I would vote yes. And if the question was to conscript women I would vote yes.

I think we can certainly agree that they were underpowered and overly complex, but no vehicle is going to work right if the crew just doesn't understand what is and is not capable of doing.

Also, maneuverability in a dog fight can be countered by speed.  For example, US fighters in the Pacific were using Boom and Zoom tactics that maximized their speed advantage to nullify the Zero's turning advantage.  I would argue that a bigger problem for the Me-262 was that the war was basically over by the time it started to be fielded, and Germany couldn't even maintain localized air superiority over its own fighter bases!

By the Eurostat’s calculations, Spain’s GDP per capita in 2017 was €24,500 as opposed to €26,300 for Italy.

In late 2007, then-prime minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero announced that Spain had overtaken Italy for the first time, according to Eurostat figures.

3446,"&gt;This also pretends that Italy and Spain would have been competitive economies outside of the EU, which is doubtful. Nobody forced southern Europe to focus a good part of their economy on tourism.

Sorry, but no. One of the consequences of the EU/Euro and the elimination of internal tariffs is that big, powerful companies can out-compete smaller ones. When Germany unificated in the 90s, west-German companies outcompeted those of east-Germany, and east-Germany's industrial output plummeted.

[Now take a look at this graph of the evolution of Spain's industrial output.](https://imgur.com/oDxCi9n)

So yeah. Being in the EU/Euro hurts Spain's industrial sectors and forces it to become a service-driven economy.

&gt;Strange. In a discussion the other day I had people saying Spain was forced by the EU to cut healthcare budget and all sorts of other cuts. Yet now Spain doesn't give a fuck about following what the EU says and Spain is richer.

It is true. The austerity measures were an humillation, but above all, were stupid. They didn't work and the consensus is that austerity is stupid and useless. It causes pain and solves nothing.

&gt;And your rant for some reason goes into the ""greedy Netherlands PM"", while we are more then happy to approve 500 billion in grants, just on the condition of oversight and that the countries follow some EU recommendations for reforms. No clue how that is supposed to be greedy.

Because the NL is a tax haven. Spain and Italy would have a bigger actuation margins if they weren't suffering from tax theft.

Plus, it's only a handful of billions other countries miss out on. I don't know about the internal situation in Spain, but Italy for example, misses out on not even 2 billion dollars a year, while missing out over a 100(!) billion every year because of internal corruption and tax fraud/evasion.

Now, I know it's a bit of a 'whataboutism', and it surely doesn't justify the tax haven constructions (of which we actually don't really profit that much), and I'm glad it's going to be abolished from next year on. But I don't think it's too much to ask from the southern countries to just justify there expenses.

3588,"&gt;Italy is actively trying to inflate the Euro currency by creating such large debts that we can do nothing else than constantly print money.

How is Italy forcing anyone to print Euros? You do know the ECB is a politically independent institution? And that monetary financing of sovereign debt is forbidden by EU treaties? And that sovereign debt purchases by the ECB is done according to its capital key? And even so only in secondary markets? And then there's the May decision of the German constitutional court...

All of this is relatively unimportant if you consider that the mandate of the ECB is price stability in the eurozone and that inflation is much more desirable to deflation, as the latter leads to much more economic pain than the former. The ECB has been targeting a 2% inflation, and they have failed so far despite their best efforts, with inflation very low or nearly non-existent.",,/r/europe/comments/ht5zb3/eu_leaders_call_it_a_night_after_dutch_block_in/fygah7z/,melhor_em_coreano,1595069611

3595,"The problem is it is never explained why NE are the winners. Why is NE profiting more from the EU? It can't just be taxes and higher retirement ages, right? 

Labour productivity in NE is higher, companies are more competitive here, clear government plans, better plans to improve infrastructure etc. The problem in Italy is you have the rich north and the poor south (just like in Europe). The Italian government doesn't want to lose the southern Italian voters so you get these half baked compromises which results in basically nothing. 10 years further down the line and the economy hasn't really improved (I think the Italian economy even has shrunk compared to 20 years ago) and bailouts are needed again. Stuff like that is getting annoying, the whole country is being held together by loosely applied tape (compromises) and then the North has to spend money again in one last try to fix things... 

Same for France, also huge debt, generous pensions, the age of retirement is 62, like 50% of France GDP is government spending. That is just insane. As soon as reforms are suggested all they do is strike and nothing happens again. 

And the same applies for Spain etc. Why focus so much on these pensions, and higher unemployment benefits creating some kind of lame nanny state. Make sure that youth unemployment decreases, invest in a healthy start-up environment (in which I thought they were pretty successful), taxes can be a huge part of this so I dont think it is that wise to have an EU wide Corporate Income Tax (any country specific regulations will be gone), but maybe have some EU wide taxes as a compromise. 

Or maybe just abandon the Euro and create a Zeuro and Neuro if all the problems arise from currency problems. The EU doesn't have to be this economic integrated trading block it can just as well be a Union between countries to provide a clean environment and maintain peace, human rights etc. It always seems to be incredibly naive that the holy grail of EU-cooperation is a unified market.

 Why would Country A say yeah Country B you are less developed here have some money while in Country A still a lot of relatively poor people are living.

&gt;Contrary to the 850-year-old monument in the capital, which still had timber roof beams, the Cathedral of St. Peter and St Paul of Nantes had been renovated with concrete roof beams following a large fire in 1972 which had reduced the roof to ashes.

&gt; Per Ferlay, ""damage is concentrated on the great organ which seems to be completely destroyed"". The platform on which it stood is also ""unstable"", he added.

3692,"She’s often criticised for not having a long term vision for the country. Pretty good at reacting to crises, not so good in preparing the country for the future (i.e. climate change, digitalisation). 

She’s known to conduct frequent opinion polls and then base her decisions on what’s going to be popular. Of course it’s debatable if that’s a good thing or not, but German media sees it as a weakness for shying away from unpopular decisions. Her one really big and risky decision was letting in 1 million refugees in 2015. That was quite controversial and has given rise to the already existing dick bag right wing cunt party AFD. They are her strongest critics. So the lesson Merkel probably learnt there was to further shy away from unpopular decisions. 

The one thing Germans value more than anything else in politics is stability. We HATE upheaval and want politics to “leave us alone”.

3693,"It has nothing to do with interfering. If funding is based on core EU principles, including human rights and freedom of religion and sexual orientation, then they have every right to close the money tap if countries are violating these principles. 

The problem is that these funds are not directly provided to these towns by the EU but through redistribution managed and decided at regional level (with strong political influence). Another problem is that money is not given to a town but to projects in those towns. So there’s no direct link between a funded project (e.g. a youth centre) and a town’s ideology or political stance (lgbt free zones). 
A bad strategy would be to stop funding all projects in designated towns, as this would only worsen the situation in those places in terms of nationalistic sentiment (us vs them).

And that women if i remember right only got a few short years in prison That's how it usually goes, the charge for aiding and abetting genocide like abusing and killing Yazidi women which is i think what that women did is disgustingly low and lenient. The left likes to say throw the book at them but that doesn't mean anything if the book ends up only being a few years in a cushy Eu jail for taking part in Genocide. And the jails are nicer than living in Syria plus she can convert and radicalize people in the short time shes there, basically Uni for terrorists. So it's hardly a punishment in any meaningful way.Why do you think she's practically begging to be in the Uk,she knows the Jails are way nicer than being in Syria and that it will only be for a short time. If the person supposedly facing justice is looking forward to it and eagerly wants to go there like its a vacation i hardly think its justice, shes obviously not afraid of it or even guilty for her horrible crimes. Maybe because she knows there's no real punishment for her crimes, probably sees the west as weak which it is if it lets her just spend a few years in a closed university basically. And considering the history of imprisoned terrorists she'll just spend her time radicalizing a bunch of people and leave just as radical as she entered. You really cant deradicalize people who are so crazy and radical they'd give up everything in Europe and join a genocidal murder death cult in the name of your demented religion. As soon as she choose to join that terror group she made the choice to give up her citizenship and fight against Europe.

 And it seems very hard for the people to influence the justice system even if there's a more conservative government, the overly leaning justice system seems to be unaccountable to the general population. So its funny when the left acts shocked that many in the right would rather people like this just rot in the middle east where they choose to fight and kill and where they belong instead of ""having the book thrown at them"". Even better would be to drone strike them or kill them with special forces or cooperate with local forces like France does so  they cant moan and complain that they cant spend a few years in a comfy resort known as a Western European jail for slaughtering countless innocent people and wanting to genocide everyone else. Or just have them face justice in the place where they did the crime, if they get executed so be it. Usually people get trailed in the place where they did the crime, especially if its something like mass murder. Its odd to deprave the victims of their crimes the opportunity to give them true justice and the opportunity to trail them in the place where they aided and abetted murder, the people there should have a say in their fate. The western European justice system feels meaningless and can hardly be called one of justice if the sentences are so light for such reprehensible crimes.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/hs6tt0/shamima_begum_can_return_to_uk_to_fight/fyfxbyg/,CapablePace,1595055445

3793,"One of the most advanced aviation designs in operational use during World War II, the Me 262's roles included light bomber, reconnaissance and experimental night fighter versions. 

While German use of the aircraft ended with the close of World War II, a small number were operated by the Czechoslovak Air Force until 1951. It also heavily influenced several designs, such as Sukhoi Su-9 (1946) and Nakajima Kikka. Captured Me 262s were studied and flight tested by the major powers, and ultimately influenced the designs of post-war aircraft such as the North American F-86 Sabre, MiG-15 and Boeing B-47 Stratojet.

Yes, there were areas that were poorer and needed help, but overall, one could always expect running water.

One major argument for expanding the EU to the former Warsaw Pact countries was helping them to raise their standard of living. Mind you, not only for ethical reasons, but also for the common market to grow bigger and make them (eventually) have more money to boost everyone's economy.

This is where my post becomes quite political:  
I know people from Poland and Bulgaria and Hungary. I love that they have these opportunities that they (or rather, their parents) didn't have before. I recognise that it takes a long time to change a country. But boy, looking at Hungary and Poland for their politics and Bulgaria for their corruption, I do wonder if Western EU politcians weren't quite naive about how them just ""being in the EU"" would just fix everything and not damage the idea of the EU itself.*

Who cares about the Pro Erdogan and Anti Erdogan voters ? And why should anybody care about it ?

Every country has politics and diplomacy. If Turkish voters doesn't understand that Erdogan is a catastrophe for their Human Rights and well being it's their problem. Turkish Media are responsible to educate and inform people.

Erdogan has bad relationships with EU, US and Russia at the same time. Turkey's reputation  is very low right now.

3894,"Santorini (Greek: Σαντορίνη), officially Thira (Greek: Θήρα) and classic Greek Thera, is an island in the southern Aegean Sea, about 200 km (120 mi) southeast of Greece's mainland. It is the largest island of a small, circular archipelago, which bears the same name and is the remnant of a volcanic caldera. It forms the southernmost member of the Cyclades group of islands, with an area of approximately 73 km^(2) (28 sq mi) and a 2011 census population of 15,550. The municipality of Santorini includes the inhabited islands of Santorini and Therasia, as well as the uninhabited islands of Nea Kameni, Palaia Kameni, Aspronisi and Christiana. The total land area is 90.623 km^(2).

The island was the site of one of the largest volcanic eruptions in recorded history: the Minoan eruption (sometimes called the Thera eruption), which occurred about 3,600 years ago at the height of the Minoan civilization. The eruption left a large caldera surrounded by volcanic ash deposits hundreds of metres deep. It may have led indirectly to the collapse of the Minoan civilization on the island of Crete, 110 km (68 mi) to the south, through a gigantic tsunami. Another popular theory holds that the Thera eruption is the source of the legend of Atlantis.",Romania,/r/europe/comments/htb1fp/santorini_greece/fyfpmc2/,filosoful,1595048600

3974,"&gt; From there, there was no murder ordered by the Government

&gt;Are you saying that since some militiamen shot some people, it is okay to BOMB fleeing civilians from WARSHIPS and then finish them off with airstrikes?
You are sick.

I guess that standard makes Holodomor and similar atrocities just nothing because ""some people did something"" also having tens of thousands of people murdered in lands taken over by revolutionaries within few weeks was hardly a series of isolated incidents.

Communists/Socialists when given power are the same thing.Totalitarian state mass murder poverty and political police executing scapegoats that caused the failed system to stop working.Same story repeats over and over again.

Especially given how big role soviet emissaries took in republican movements and international brigades that came to Spain.But i guess getting executed by nkvd operatives is better than getting killed by ""WARSHIPS"" for some reason.

But ""This Time IT will work"" is a common way that even today after a century of failure and mass murder done in name of that failed ideology people on radical left think.After all Chomsky visited Chavez not even 15 years ago and praised him and now it joined a list of ""not real socialism"".

4179,"&gt;I do not care about national myths or what you think happened 1000 years ago. 

First off, they're not myths. Armenians have been living in Asia Minor and the Caucasus for thousands of years. Do some research, read about the Armenian Kingdoms of ancient times. Armenia contended with multiple Persian Empires (Achaemenids, Medians, Sassanids, Safavids), the Parthians, the Romans, the Greeks (Seleucids, Mithridates of Pontus, etc), the Cappadocians, and a myriad of other nations. They're not myths because these kingdoms were recorded by multiple sources (the Assyrians, Persians, Romans, Parthians, Egyptians, Greeks, etc). 

&gt; 96,7 % of ""Crimeans"" voted to join Russia in an unrecognized referendum,just like Artsakh. 

Yes but unlike Artsakh/Nagorno-Karabakh, the Crimean referendum was widely criticized by international observers. 

&gt;Everybody emigrated from somewhere,all mankind originated in Africa(scientific fact),therefore those ""ancient claims""are bullshit. 

The fact that you're resorting to comparing migrations made by prehistoric humans to modern-day immigration shows how insecure you are in your argument. An ""ancient claim"" would be to claim all Armenians are descended from Hayk, what I'm talking about is historical fact.  

&gt; Again,it does not matter.Law matters 

So you're saying we should subvert the will of a long-suffering people to uphold arbitrary and maliciously-drawn borders made by a crazy dictator? Are you really saying that if a majority as large as 95% of a population desires independence from a country that tortures them, they should not be allowed to secede because some tyrant drew lines on a map?",Armenia,/r/europe/comments/hsu69j/will_armenia_and_azerbaijan_go_to_war_again/fyf79ci/,Imperator-Rome_95-BC,1595036099

Let's not pretend that it's not thinly veiled Jedwabnecore that uses a biblical figure to disguise racism.

&gt;Nothing if you apparently do feel competent in knowing each and everyone.

Let's make one thing clear. We're not talking about two disagreeing parties who decide to uphold some mutual respect despite their differences (or not). We're not talking about taste and preference. We're talking about a group that's discriminated against, attacked and disadvantaged. They deserve to be treated better, they deserve to be equal in the eyes of the law and they deserve to live in peace, but they are not given these things. Saying ""you'll get what you want if you're nice to us"" comes from a place of privilege and condescension and serves no purpose other than to uphold the current situation, dismissing a huge part of the population as an aesthetic nuisance. It's saying ""your human rights come second to my feelings"". And that is something that's not acceptable because, as Stonewall taught us, bricks and molotovs are far more effective means of negotiation than bending over and hoping that the majority gets bored with fucking you over and lets you stand upright.

Yes, they have higher support in east Germany, but all East German states combined have roughly only the same population as Bavaria alone. So it’s not really important for the federal election.

The problem of the Greco-turkish eez isnt meyisti or kastellorizo.

Greece has been willing to make a compromise in the eez of kastellorizo since forever. Every greek pm since papandreou has offered it as a compromise, the problem is turkey claims half of the agean sea and the entire east med as its eez.besides the fact that these claims are usubstantiated and oburd , no greek pm no matter how progressive or internationalist is ever gonna accept such a deal because the agean sea is the greek core.

The greek government has made it self perfectly clear, there will be no deal were turkey gets to pillage greek natural resources, if turkey tries to force a deal by sending in a drill ship the greek navy will sink it and then all hell breaks loose.

And i mean honestly turkish ultranationalists need to shut the fuck up, all this talk about the strenght of turkey and its glorious martyrs and they are still too chickenshit to event sent a drill or make a move on kastellorizo.

Sure, we don't have the mafia, but that doesn't mean there aren't people pulling the strings behind the politicians. You've got Murdoch in control of the media, a bunch of paedophile/paedophile protecting aristocrats in the background, etc. Boris is nothing more than a culmination of 40 years of these people getting more and more brazen. And that's before you factor in Russia's involvement in our elections and the brexit referendum.

But as someone who truly believes in the principles of the EU with its strength through unity and even in my short time saw the benefits eurofunds were bringing (Even if so much of it was laundered/used to do mad shit like Graf Ignatiev), I think you guys have a much better shot.

And not just because of the EU, but because like you said, Boyko, Dogan, Peevski, Geshev don't represent Bulgaria or the history of Bulgaria. You know for a fact they'd have been the sort of people who collaborated with the Ottomans under the yoke. But I don't think they've won, not long term. The people out on the street, the people who love and respect Bulgaria's history, I think they will sooner than later win out against them. The people won in 1989, but the madness following allowed the Oligarchs to take hold in the background, and you can win again.

Meanwhile, what do we have here? People who have literally said they will watch the country burn to the ground just out of spite of not being bossed around by the French or having Polish plumbers. They've been fighting a war against the Britain and its ideals for the last 40 years and they've won. They had to fight dirty and use illegal foreign interference to do it, but the impact of what they've done will easily last a lifetime.

4358,"Here's what the creators of the ranking say about Poland 

&gt;The government’s drive to subjugate the judicial system and a growing tendency to criminalize defamation are beginning to have an effect on the freedom of expression of independent media outlets. Some courts are now using article 212 of the criminal code, under which journalists can be sentenced to as much as a year in prison for defamation, although the civil code offers citizens all the protection they need if they are defamed. Even if the courts usually content themselves with fining journalists, the use of article 212 encourages self-censorship by the independent media. The Warsaw daily Gazeta Wyborcza continues to be the leading target of government lawsuits.
Partisan discourse and hate speech are still the rule within state-owned media, which have been transformed into government propaganda mouthpieces. Their new directors tolerate neither opposition nor neutrality from employees and fire those who refuse to comply. Many protests have been staged outside the offices of the management of the state-owned TV broadcaster TVP. After one of these protests in February 2019, the TVP evening news programme “Wiadomosci” broadcast video footage and personal details of ten of the demonstrators. TVP also filed a complaint against Polish ombudsman Adam Bodnar, who said its references to Gdansk mayor Pawel Adamowicz amounted to hate speech and implied that this could have encouraged the person who murdered Adamowicz in January 2019.

These 'demands' were placed on all countries, I still remember well that the Netherlands was also placed on the 'accused couch' and our budgets got denied by Brussels. You don't hear us whine and blaming everybody, there's a substantial difference in mentality there.

There's a common set of rules set out in the treaties and countries need to adhere to those, and when they do not, need to provide for a plan to work towards doing so.

&gt; Greece, Spain, Italy, et al suffered huge economic pain

We all did. Some just whined harder than others. When in France the government proposes a reform the whole nation goes into civil war mode. Around here we complain, but we accept it. And that got us the advantage of being to able to push through substantial reforms at a quick pace, going from a basket case to one of the most competitive markets in a decade.

Up next, he brings in all leaders to The Hague to talk. So he now looks like an actual leader and watch all those larger countries coming to small Holland and taking us serious now. That stuff plays well here.

Uhm, i dunno, maybe to The Principality Of Polotsk, The Principality Of Kiev, The Principality Of Smolensk, The Principality Of Chernigov, etc? In other words - to Kievan Rus?

You do understand that these territories became ""Lithuanian"" only because the Mongols raped, destroyed and burned all the cities of Kievan Rus to South of Novgorod? 

Like, when Kievan Rus ceased to exist as a single state, the Poles and Lithuanians simply occupied these territories one by one. And then did the same when the Russian Kingdom began dynastic strife. 

[You can literally trace how Lithuania began to actively expand from the XIV century at the expense of the territories of Kievan Rus.](https://i.imgur.com/QglfF9J.jpg) Just because you were able to freely enter the looted and burned lands of others does not make you their legitimate ruler.

4679,"Yes, but at least in my country, it's also because if you have children early, your socioeconomic status is more likely lower. You didn't go to university, so your earning potentional on average is lower. Then you pass on this socioeconomic status to your kids, hence they end up also not going to uni, and hence they will have children younger. This is not something I consider a positive development in general. Czech republic is among those OECD countries where you are the most likely to not have a higher education than your parents. Ideally the social mobility should be higher here and for university educated women, the possibilities to combine careers with kids should be better. 

I think Western countries that want solid birth rates should work with two groups of women, those that are family-oriented and want mutiple children, don't really care what it will do to their career, but may have financial worries that the family budget just won't manage it and with career-oriented women who however also want kids, they may not be that afraid how it will affect them financially, because they are well covered, but they are afraid it will ruin their professional life.

4765,"The Dutch Safety Board wrote about the effects on the passengers when the plane broke up. They regard the fall as non-survivable:

""Due to the aeroplane breaking up, the occupants were exposed to the following factors:

Deceleration and acceleration
The aeroplane was flying at cruising altitude and at a constant speed. The separating of 
the front section of the aeroplane caused a sudden deceleration, which changed into an 
acceleration as a result of the aeroplane falling down. This sudden deceleration and the 
subsequent acceleration exerted forces on the occupants’ bodies. It may have caused 
dizziness, nausea and loss of consciousness.11,12 Powerful deceleration or acceleration 
could have resulted in (serious) injury due to contact with hard objects (for example, seats or luggage) or due to the seatbelt. Occupants who were not wearing their seatbelt or were walking around the cabin, risked a greater chance of injury. It is likely that people were also injured by objects flying around such as hand luggage and parts of the aeroplane that had torn loose.

Decompression
After the aeroplane was hit by metal fragments, cabin pressure was lost and became 
equal to the ambient pressure (decompression).13 The sudden decrease in air pressure 
causes acute expansion of the chest and can lead to (serious internal) injury.14,15

Decompression in the aeroplane was accompanied by the formation of mist resulting 
from the condensation of water vapour present in the cabin. This mist is so dense that it 
is often confused with smoke as the result of a fire. Research has revealed that, even 
though it soon disappears, this mist can contribute to disorientation.16

Reduced oxygen availability
Loss of cabin pressure also resulted in the oxygen supply being lost. This meant that the 
occupants were exposed to thin air with a greatly reduced oxygen level. At an altitude of 
10 kilometres, the amount of oxygen available is approximately a quarter compared with 
that at sea level.17

A lack of oxygen can result in shortness of breath, dizziness, disorientation, loss of 
concentration and eventually to loss of consciousness. The speed at which a person loses consciousness as a result of oxygen deficiency 18 depends on the altitude. At an altitude of 9 to 10 km (30,000-33,000 feet), the lack of oxygen leads to unconsciousness within 
30 seconds to one minute. A rapid descent, as in the case of flight MH17, leads to an 
increase in the amount of available oxygen.19

Cold
The outside air temperature at the flight altitude at the time of the impact varied between 
-40 °C to -50 °C. This means that the difference between the temperature inside the 
aeroplane and the ambient temperature exceeded 60  °C. A sudden exposure to this 
temperature difference causes a shock effect and leads to immediate physical reactions, 
such as a reduction in skin blood flow. Additionally, acute exposure to extreme cleads to an increased respiratory rate (hyperventilation) with a decreasing level of carbon 
dioxide in the blood, and corresponding decrease in blood flow to the brain.20,21 This can 
lead to dizziness and reduced consciousness.22,23 

Airflow
When an aeroplane breaks up, the people on board are exposed to the airflow caused 
by the speed of the aeroplane. In this case, there was an airflow with a speed of roughly 
900 km/h (480-490 knots). By comparison, the winds accompanying hurricane Katrina24
had a maximum speed of 282 km/h.25, 26 A human being can withstand this kind of airflow, 
but will have difficulty breathing and moving and is entirely caught up by the powerful 
airflow.27 Injuries may be caused as parts of the body are caught by the airflow. In addition 
to possible injuries, the extreme airflow also causes further loss of body heat (wind chill 
effect).

Detached aeroplane parts, luggage and occupants who were walking around in the 
cabin may have been caught by the airflow. The airflow was strongest at the fracture 
edges, decreasing towards the rear section of the aeroplane because of the obstacles in 
the interior. The airflow created by the rapid descent caused a noise comparable to that 
of a very severe storm. This could have contributed to possible startle reactions and 
disorientation. From photographs by journalists and eyewitness accounts it appears that several 
passengers were found at the scene of the crash without any clothes. This finding concurs 
with previous aeroplane crashes. The explanation is that the powerful airflow ripped off the light holiday clothes many people were wearing. 

Impact on the ground
All occupants were exposed to the force associated with falling to the ground from an 
altitude of 10 kilometres. Regardless of the exact speed, the impact on the ground after 
a fall from this altitude is regarded as non-survivable.""",,/r/europe/comments/hss1jd/on_this_day_in_2014_flight_mh17_was_shot_down/fycsup3/,ConlangOlfkin,1594990911

He said Obama had the CIA sneak in *American* gear, disguising it as Russian style weapons systems, and he had them shoot down the plane on purpose.

Why would Obama shoot down a plane packed with innocent humans? To distract away from the migrant crisis at the southern border at the time.

4814,"I don't know what you are interested in, but I will try to explain the background of this particular case in short.

In Greece there are many refugees and many immigrants, who would normally like to travel to Europe. Throughout the years, it has become clear that Europe isn't in favour of accepting them, so many of them are stuck in Greece.

Since most goevrnements want to hide the issue instead of trying to solve it, there are hotspots where those people leave and some of them are set free in the mainland, if their asylum application gets confirmed, as the international laws demand. For these people, there is some financial help, which comes from european money, and not directly from the greek state. Also, since there is not so much central coordination, some organizations, either humanitarian or political, have tried to help the refugees by feeding them, occupying empty buildings, so that they can live inside, teaching them greek or other european languages and even helping them with medical issues.

The new government issued laws and organized evictions for these people without having a plan for them, so many of them gathered on a square in the center of Athens. Some days ago, the municipality even dismantled the sitting banks of the square to force them to leave. The demonstration that was organized on the 15th demanded that these people leave the square. The organizers were presented as inhabitants of the region, but this is the usual way in which xenophobic and far right organizations present themselves, in order to express some of the concerns of the real inhabitants and to achieve interference in politics without being openly recognized as far right.

The government also passed new legislation in order to make demonstrations more difficult and eventually to forbide some of them. This is a wise move, since within one year police brutality and finance can become a huge problem for them. Of course the financial situation has to do with the covid19 outbreak too, and it's not only due to corruption issues. 

So, with all this background, I think that the situation becomes a little easier to understand. The far right in disguise organized a protest against refugees, calling them illegal immigrants. Some antifascists gathered for a counter protest. The police attacked the antifascists, hitting them like that, even though the protesters didn't act violently.

And here we are now discussing if the counter protest or the refugees are legal, as if that changes anything from the actual facts.",Greece,/r/europe/comments/hsc5bd/police_violently_attacks_peaceful_antiracist/fycj6n9/,iGL-,1594983354

But another side to war remembrance is the glorification of war and that I do not agree with. I do not think my great grandfather was some great man for going to war (WWI, Canada). He killed people because the state put him in a bad situation and made him do things no human should do. I am thankful he was brave enough to fight for what he was told was right. I pity him and feel sorry that his life was partly wasted so that mine didn't have to be.

The memorial should be to the tragedy of forcing young men to kill each other and especially that they were forced to murder civilians.

4952,"I understand that you are making a larger argument about ""cancel culture"" but I honestly do not see why people need to dig their heels in on the other side.

There has been controversy in Canada about our historical figures. Although we have never worshipped our ""founding fathers"" in the same way as the US does, our first Prime Minister is still, obviously, well remembered for the work he did to bring Canada into existence. However, it also seems that he said quite a lot of racist things about the natives. Some people say his name should be removed from schools, etc., and that he should not be so fondly remembered. Others say our history should not be erased.

I guess I would have to ask, why do we need to worship people at all? He is a historical figure and we will always remember that he was the first Prime Minister. We already knew he was a flawed man (a drunk and a gambler) anyway, so is it bad if we also add his racist views to that complex picture? He won't be removed from the history books, even if we don't name our schools after him. He wasn't a god after all...

So it isn't that my only argument is ""it doesn't harm anything"". Rather, I guess I just wonder why we even need to worship this dog at all? Can we not recognise the complicated history of ""war heroes"" (the actual humans who flew the planes) having racist views and naming their dog a racist name? It doesn't take away from what they did. They still fought for their country. The dog won't be erased from history. I actually think we would improve the memorial to remove the mistake these men made.

4968,"&gt;That is pretty obvious. Because the Italian state misses out on a lot of tax income. Resulting in a shortage in their budget.

Let me explain it better. Why 180 billion does not actually exist:

1. Eliminating shadow economy will increase social spending. This is especially true for low-wage informal workers who are not receiving benefits in Italy(This is why % of unemployed people in Italy who effectively receive unemployment benefits is low). Usually, people who work those jobs receive more in benefits than pay taxes anyway.

2. Lowering demand by 180 billion would lead to much lower tax revenues in other areas, especially because poor people working those sectors are the backbone of Italian demand. That would in turn raise the deficit even more. Take note people spending has certain multiplier effect.

3. There is no empirical evidence that countries go broke over shadow economy. Italian shadow economy is not crazy large anyway, its the size of average east asian shadow economy.

4. Taxing a economy with depressed demand pushes it into the debt spiral even more.

&gt;For the Netherlands this means: - liabilty for banks/government/ECB that borrow money to Italy - italy needs money from the outside, see the EUR 750b support package that is a hot button issue - people trust the Euro less as their is a lot of debt behind it and less than stable economies - and it is detrimental for the health of the EU economy in general, that the Netherlands is a part of

Coporate tax profits in Netherlands compared to GDP: Around 3% or 27.3 billion(12.83 billions from foreign firms) 

Net contribution to EU budget as GDP : Around 0.37% or 3.431 billion

EU specific tax benefit for Dutch as GDP: Around 0.68 % or 6.415 billion 

**TLDR : Dutch are benefiting directly and indirectly when taking a conservative approach and assuming just half of foreign multinationals profits are based on EU induced profit shifting. The real number estimated by economists is higher.**

I just saw a fucking snake sliding in the box and it just disappeared in the house, I've left the house and closed every way, am I calling the cops ? the pound ? What should I do ??

edit: the firefighter are in thre way thank you rachel57020, they asked me to described the snake, it seamed brown but it went so fast, I was totally shocked when I saw it, when I told them the snake was brown and the package origin they took it very seriously.


- A good bbq ?

- Is snake any good in bbq ?

- Yes, it's like chicken with the taste X2 and calamary texture.
You need to cleanly cut the head and bleed it to avoid any venom

- Get the head off, empty the carcass. It is preferable to get ride of the skin too, like you do with a long glove, slowly peel off the skin.

5307,"&gt;Maybe not every 'communist' system has to involve Gulags, does it? 

Every communist system has to involve an extreme level of punishment such as gulags. Whether it's specifically a gulag or something else isn't relevant. Exchanging goods and services for abstract unit of exchange (commonly money) is inherently a form of society that makes sense and works. Using an abstract unit of exchange is such a natural and simple concept that it can be taught, or even begin to exist by itself, in nonhuman animals, like other primates. Essentially yes communism has to involve a gulag level of punishment to exist, otherwise people would simply trade with money and the shitty system which communism is would cease to exist.

This is the key point which communists get wrong. There is no communism without suffering. Money, which is a name for an abstract unit of exchange, is a natural concept.",,/r/europe/comments/hsfecp/church_of_christs_resurrection_in_podgorica/fybaycs/,07mci,1594947856

Yeah no. Africa does not want European interference or ""influence"". They have had quite enough of that, so this is doomed to fail. You seem to think that Africa is still some weak and malleable place that can easily be Westernized to match our values. It does not get more delusional and dangerous than this type of thinking.

&gt;Furthermore, India is not so keen on human rights, especially on minorities, and it will come time when we will be supporting yet another oppressing leader. 

Get the idea that you are going to find non-Western allies who 100% share our values out of your head as soon as possible. This is not going to happen. Don't let perfect be the enemy of good.

Since Ireland is yet to ban Americans, they definitely don’t need to go on a roundabout trip to the North to get into the country. 

Croatia is another EU member outside Schengen. They depend hugely on tourism and are actively advertising to Americans that they should come.

5372,"I'll try, but take in acount that English is not my native language and some errors may occur.

1. During the war the Rebel side start a campaign of terror, this was achieve by rape, murdering, radio propaganda (look for Queipo de Llano's radio speechs) etc.. 
 Although, in the government side in the first days-months some brutality occurred it was make by anarchist militias and not the regular army, and where cut out quickly. 

2. The rebels comited civil masacres with cruelty, "" La desbanda"" or Guernika are good examples. I mean, in a war sadly are civil casualties, but shorebombard a column of civilians running away is bad shit. 


3. When the war was over there was executions and a lot of repression against the ones who stayed loyal to the government, teachers, officers, civilians, workers, even kids were assassinated or jailed.

4. The dictatorship used political prisoners in megalomaniac constructiona like the Valle de los Caidos, the slaves, I mean ""workers"", worked in inhumane conditions causing the death of hundreds. 
Also the regiment builded concentration camps for prisoners, the conditions of this camps were like the ones the nazis have. 

5. The regiment used a lot of propaganda and laws to appear as the good ones, the ones who saved Spain, but nope, they didn't. 
The propaganda varied from the famous Pantanos to the mith that Franco created the Seguridad Social. 
In the laws example, the regiment launch a law that make the ones who stayed loyal to the legit government count as traitors and the real rebels. (I think this may have not sense its difficult to explain) 


6. A dictatorship (well, this reason is a clearly one) 


7. Franco himself prepared everything for when he died a monarchy would be stablished, and that's the reason for the Monarchy in Spain. 


8. During the period know as La Transicion, the heads of the diying dictatorship where protected against everything. This lead to absourd situation like needing an Argentinian cout to investigate the repression because the Spanish judges can't investigate it.

5393,"&gt; I meant the whole part about them giving money where others didn’t, or did I misunderstand?

Yes, PiS instituted the 500+ program which meant you got 500 PLN (about 120 Euro) for your second child and each child after that nets you another 500 PLN. Then PiS expanded the program so that you get 500 PLN for your first child and an additional 500 PLN for each child after that. There are additional ""+"" programs that PiS implemented but I don't have all of the details, I believe there were additional pension payments for retirees AKA the so-called 13th pension which will be implemented this year and then a 14th pension which is supposed to come around in 2021. 

Now, you might correctly think that 120 EUR (plus the additional pensions) is basically not much to live on BUT imagine you are out in the sticks of your country, you're underemployed or unemployed, and then comes along a PiS representative who promises you money for the kids that you have and they tell you that your mother or father will have a little extra money paid to them for retirement. 

This after 8 years prior to being told by the now opposition party (formerly known as PO, now known as KO) ""Look at us! We're becoming a second Ireland!"" (this was during the boom that was going on in Ireland) and ""Look at us! We're a green island in a sea of red!"" (This refers to Poland supposedly avoiding the worst parts of the 2008-2009 recession. For a visual representation, see [this.](https://media.wplm.pl/pictures/wp/photo/2013-03/3440/2273/pap_20090529_0fe.jpg) ). 

Out in the ""sticks"", away from the big cities, all that talk of ""becoming a second Ireland"" or a ""green island"" doesn't translate to you having more money and some security in your life. So I guess you can imagine the resentment that was building up in the areas that were left behind, so to speak, and how PiS managed to build up a voter base. 

Also, if you are willing to use DeepL or Google Translate, there is an interview with a mayor of a small town in Poland about why PiS had the recent and prior successes in small towns: https://wiadomosci.onet.pl/tylko-w-onecie/wybory-2020-burmistrz-raciaza-wyjasnia-dlaczego-w-malych-osrodkach-przegrywa/ktvjlb9 (don't worry this is not state-owned media :P) 

&gt;Heard about this. Wasn’t there a polish anti communist pope as well?

Only the most famous Pope of them all at least for Poles: John Paul II :)  

Feel free to ask further questions in case you need me to clarify anything :) Also, in case I came off as some ardent PiS supporter: I don't support them, I try to look for reasons why people might vote for them instead of just putting them in a box labelled ""lumpenproletariat"" and then hiding it in a basement :)",Polihs grasshooper citizen,/r/europe/comments/hrvi2k/day_7_thousands_protest_in_bulgaria_against/fyaxkx7/,SlyScorpion,1594940221

The biggest problem was (is) that public television shouldn't be biased towards any candidate. Private TV - they can do what they want. But not public television. Today, 49% of voters, 9.5 million people, didn't trust the public service. That's an issue. And a huge one at it.

Sure, you may say it wasn't much better when PO was at power (I wouldn't agree fully with that), but just because previous party was doing wrong, doesn't mean next party in power has to continue the absurdity. If PiS wanted support from media, they could have had it from Polsat. They were actually the most undecided tv station, leaning towards Duda from time to time. But using TVP as a campaign tool is an undemocratic practice. TVP should show both sides and promote discussion without favoring any side.

Duda actually talked about it in the interview on YT, he said that he did ""fire"" Kurski once, and he won't hesitate the 2nd time. And I honestly hope he does it, even if he helped Duda win the elections. Kurski is just an asshole, period.
Duda also mentioned that TVP should be reformed again to go back to normal but this time not by politicians but by reporters and presenters.

5479,"&gt; Then again, local companies don't provide near the amount of tax revenue as a company like Apple, not to mention the jobs it creates.

How do you measure this? Generally a single large corporation would be replaced by multiple smaller businesses, not one. Economies of scale should make the larger businesses more efficient, but if they are not paying their tax locally it doesn't really matter as you're only raising money with VAT and employing less relative to output.

&gt; I really don't understand why people think Ireland should up their taxes to match other EU countries that have ungodly high taxes.  Never in the discussion is the possibility of other countries lowering their taxes to become more competitive 

For many Europeans, they simply don't want this. Personally I associate less tax with less public services, but they provide many of the things which make me feel secure and value a society. If you ask Brits what they feel patriotic about, the NHS will be a common answer - a tax funded government organisation. European countries tend to have strong social safety nets, which again provides security but costs money - for example, governments paying wages for workers furloughed due to COVID lockdowns.

These things can't exist without effective taxation. Businesses are incentivised to register wherever tax is lowest, but benefit from the stability created by overseas social programs anyway. The benefits are detached from the burden, creating a race to the bottom of tax liability - countries want to be the cheapest place to attract maximum registrations, enabling their development by taxing productivity from other nations. The impact tax has on society doesn't matter when selecting a location to register because the single market allows you to access more expensive economies anyway.",,/r/europe/comments/hs5ss3/european_commission_proposes_using_treaty/fyb28nr/,Jamessuperfun,1594942791

&gt;Lol. Serbians attacking and murdering albanians started way before 96 lmao.

&gt;Death count by milo and frens is at least 20000+.

Well I myself personally knew over 200 killed by Albanians (a small village).

&gt;Some albanians had their infants heads ripped off or had their fetuses torn apart. 

And Serbs (including my brother and mother) were raped, bad organs stolen etc 

&gt;What you think the KLA formed because people just wanted to kill some serbs?

No they formed to leave Serbia (which is against the Serbian constitution btw)

&gt;. At least you know where they are buried as opposed to thousands of missing dead albanians. 

You think I do? All I found was half their heads. Along with a few body parts. I know where about 1/5 of their body's are burried, no more

Instead, you get something like this: https://ec.europa.eu/budget/fts/index_en.htm and that link can only be found on the bottom of this page: https://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/countries/member-countries/poland_en . And I haven't even gotten into knowing what search terms to use in order to find the information you need.

5627,"Abridged version of the article:  
  
&gt;**About a fifth of the soy exported to the EU from Brazil’s Amazon and Cerrado regions... may be coming from land that has been deforested**, according to the study published in the journal Science.      
  
&gt;**The study comes at a key moment, as the EU is finalising a trade deal with the Mercosur group of Latin American countries**, including Brazil, that could increase trade in agricultural commodities. Austria has already raised concerns over fires in the Amazon as a reason to reject the agreement.  
  
&gt;Environmental campaigners are urgently seeking safeguards to ensure any increase in trade does not encourage deforestation, which has increased in Brazil under the government of Jair Bolsonaro, who has been accused of presiding over the destruction of the Amazon and other key regions.   
  
&gt;**There are already signs that trade in key commodities may be stepping up.** Earlier this month, a shipment of soy believed to be the biggest ever imported to the EU arrived in Amsterdam. The conservation charity WWF calculated the soy came from land equivalent to 80,000 football fields, and said... it was impossible to be sure that soy shipments to Europe were not linked to recent deforestation or habitat destruction.  
  
&gt;**The Brazilian government’s response to deforestation has been criticised as being largely ineffective**: this year, despite two helicopters and 97 agents, the operation reportedly failed to fine anyone, arrest anyone or seize anything.  
  
&gt;Meanwhile, corporate interests are becoming increasingly concerned. In June, foreign investors managing trillions of dollars in assets warned the Brazilian government that escalating deforestation and the “dismantling” of policies to protect the environment and indigenous communities were “creating widespread uncertainty about the conditions for investing”.  
  
&gt;Environmentalists say fines for deforestation are often ignored and rarely enforced, and that the government has hobbled environment agency work since it came to power. They also say the Brazilian government does not take the climate emergency seriously.  
  
&gt;**The Brazilian environment minister, Ricardo Salles, has called the climate crisis a “secondary issue”**, while the foreign minister, Ernesto Araújo, has described it as Marxist plot.  
  
&gt;A spokesperson for Brazil’s government said: “Illegal deforestation is a crime and fighting it is a priority for Brazil. The [science paper] acknowledges that the vast majority of Brazilian agriculture output is sustainable and deforestation-free. Trade restrictions would not contribute to solve the problem and would rather harm hardworking families.”",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/hsfpue/a_fifth_of_brazilian_soy_in_europe_is_result_of/fya56n5/,AdaptedMix,1594926083

5680,"No, burning money is not the only reason we are brexiting.

There are many reasons but let me give you just one that is all over the news today: the Muslim woman who fled the U.K. to join isis her name is shemima begum. Her husband was killed in Syria and now she has had a change of heart(I don’t believe it) and now wants to come home to the U.K. 
our then Home Secretary sajid david rightfully stripped her of her British citizenship on grounds that she is danger to the U.K. public. She can get Bangladesh citizenship through her mother. 
Which I agree with because if you support isis and then the going gets tough and you want to come back to the comforts and democracy of the U.K. we ain’t idiots, she isn’t wanted she is a terrorist. 
Now the eu has over ruled our government and is demanding we take her back from Syria. So our government has our best interests to heart to some extent while the eu clearly doesn’t. We want out to govern our own country, we know what’s best for us and don’t need telling from continental Europe. 

Continental Europe was powerful a 120 years ago: just like the British empire that’s history and won’t be returning. Thinking it will again is a pipe dream.

Poland is also not paying attention to Eu, they don’t even want a kebab shop in their country. Erdogan threatened eu that if they don’t give him 3billion he will be flooding Europe with three million more economic migrants and refugees, while he was buying black market oil from isis and selling them arms in return. Eu just gave apple 12billion tax dodge.

It’s a sad joke. The best for all of us unfortunately is to disband because the eu is going to destroy us from within. It’s jobs for the boys while the rest of us regular folk are getting fucked daily and it’s not going to stop.

I mean, look how hard we came down on Russia for its continued encroachment in South Ossetia, Abkhazia, Transnistria, Crimea, and Eastern Ukraine. The fact that the Baltics and Poland don't exactly trust our mutual defense assurances is groundless. Should Russia ever invade one of our ""EU partners"" we would deploy every one of our broom sticks into battle. That is after we tried several years of failed diplomatic solutions. We would do so as a show of strength before the commencement of construction on NS3 though, to show we were serious.

We will act as a global champion for human rights but as soon as China's ambassador threatens car exports we will assure China there will be no consequences for their trade violations, concentration camps, or encroachment on Hong Kong's sovereignty.

Yes and the thing is, they trusted a totalitarian regime and treated their statements as fact instead of doing proper research themselves. That's the problem.

Man I would laugh but I'm kind of sad that you've been duped into thinking that anything conservative (even though I'm not) is bad.

Yeah so 1) they didn't do their research, 2) You should look up Bret Weinstein and Graham Hancock to learn why that statement is beyond insane. Bottom line, science is actually beholden to things like grants more than they'd like to admit.

To your second paragraph, that law could be revisited if there was enough political will. It’s from 20 years ago. 

And to your third point, as much of a point as arguing anything to do with climate change. Political attitudes are the #1 roadblock to stopping climate change before it gets too bad. One fo those roadblocks is the aversion to nuclear. Have a look back at the picture in the OP if you must, Germany is unlikely to reach France’s levels of CO2 intensity anytime soon if they continue to delude themselves with the dream of a 100% renewable grid.

For instance waiting to call it a pandemic. They were afraid that they may make the same mistake as they have done before and call the coronavirus a pandemic too early when it was not needed. The word pandemic is powerful and it makes sense to be sure that it is going to become one. It's like naming storms. When storms are named that means that you should pay attention and be careful if your place is going to be impacted. But if we decided to give it a name every time the wind surpassed 3m/s it is going to be a lot less imprtant.

I agree that it was the lack of regulations on wildlife for food that made the virus able to get to humans easily, and the markets for wild animals should probably be closed for good. Unfortunately these types of markets are a large source of income to the Chinese.

Personally I believe that that the WHO can take little of the blame and that lack of willingness from China to help the WHO to identify and research the virus while we only had a few cases. I also believe that WHO told and did what they should tell and do with what they had to hand. President Trump's idea to slash funding for the WHO I believe is a bad idea in the middle of a pandemic. The WHO is our only organ for cooperation between countries on health. 

The US, especially the Trump administration needs to carry a lot of the blame for what has happened to their country. The Trump administration decided to lower funds to the CDC, and to pandemic preparation. The administration also stopped a program where the US would help defeat potential pandemics in their original country before the bacteria/virus got to mainland US.",,/r/europe/comments/hs6nj8/spain_says_goodbye_to_the_40000_victims_image_of/fy8ysme/,fiskeburgeren,1594904596
