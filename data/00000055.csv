No, it started at 632 AD, right after the death of Muhammad.

They left to avoid the systematic massacres, excecutions and death marches that Turks commited, and they went mostly towards Greece or the nearest friendly country they could find.

They behave like nationalist populists, where democracy doesn't matter, and anything is secondary to independence. They know they don't have the majority but still wanna push the country to the precipice by doing a unilateral secession, which in a best case scenario would transform us into a some kind of Kosovo. Also many of them have clear ethno-nationalist tendencies, even if they hide them well enough. It should tell you something that Lega supports Junts per Catalunya (https://elpais.com/ccaa/2018/06/01/catalunya/1527840641_720720.html)

I am an ethnic Catalan national, and I've seen how far down we have come in the last decade. The Catalan government forgot about everything besides independence, and the country lives basically by inertia, but there's no direction at all. This topic has blinded everything else.

And I'm not saying that we souldn't have a referendum. We totally should, but not at any price. If we break all the rules, both legal and ethical, we are losing ourselves in the way. Democracy without law is just populist demagogery.

I also donit shy away from blaming Spanish nationalists for this. Instead of trying to find a solution, they just blinded their inaction with the law. And the police beatings during the referendum were a disgrace, and I hope there are legal consequences (there's a trial underway). But it takes two to tango, and the Catalan politicians decided to surf the nationalist wave and make it bigger by populist rhetoric and tactics, instead of trying to find a solution.

&gt; A message addressed to thieves, written in Romanian, in a Tesco supermarket in Great Britain scandalized a Romanian architect from London.
&gt; 
&gt; ""Warning for shoplift thieves. Shoplifted thieves will be prosecuted. Civilian-clad police officers are operating in the area."" This is the message displayed at the drinks stand of a Tesco supermarket in London.
&gt; 
&gt; According to adevarul.ro , the poster scandalized Iolanda Costide, a well-known Romanian architect in London, who was, until 1995, president of the Cultural Association of Romanians in England.
&gt; 
&gt; The Romanian sent an open letter to Tesco representatives in which she expressed her dissatisfaction with the message addressed to the thieves in Romanian.
&gt; 
&gt; ""It is not worthy for a chain that presents itself as progressive, in the service of people, such as Tesco, to allow ethnic profiling in its stores. The image shows a warning, in Romanian, against the thief.
&gt; 
&gt; We must believe that all Romanians are thieves , or maybe only those who do not speak the language of the bard and need this outrageous message to be explained in Romanian?

186,"Wrong, communism never worked because of communism. A centrally planned economy can never work long term. What you end up with is huge misallocation of resources. Some areas get overinvested in while others barely survive. You could see this regularly by shortage of basic needs like toiler paper, tooth paste, meat, fruit, etc. Stuff that our country was perfectly capable of producing in sufficient amounts but couldn't because of shit planning. And this was not exclusive to my country either.
In theory, everything was supposed to belong to everyone. What you had in practice was the ""wealthy"" having their shit confiscated to help build up the country and when the money ran out, it was game over. And by wealthy, I also mean people who had bigger farms for example. My friend's grandfather was thrown into prison because he did not want to give up his farm. 
Then you had overemployment because not working was a crime and you would go to jail. So no matter if a factory needed more workers, they got them. I know plenty of people who worked 2-3h a day because 1. there was not much to do and 2. nobody gave a shit because everything was everyone's so nothing was no one's. 
You cannot have communism without authoritarianism because people are not equal. So the only way to even try to achieve equality is with force.

With racism, I'd much rather have it shown how it was at the times. But there would probably be pearl-clutching, because surely you can't portray a character with such views and not have them be a one-dimensional villain?! And if it's in a fictional setting, it can be used to imply things about the author, *even if it's misunderstood* and based on faulty analysis. It takes writing effort to make it nuanced, and it's difficult to gauge how much the audience need to be told who to sympathise with. If the show is Morally Infallible Protagonist vs. Pure Evil Antagonist, of course they'll only be able to show racism in the antagonist, regardless of historical/cultural setting.

It helps that the crown is based around real events, there are records of the speeches and such. Though I do think they glorify Elizabeth a bit, everyone comes across as complex and flawed people.

The opposition to an Eastern chancellor who lived through the troublesome reunification is loud from the East, that's already weird, and her replacement is looking likely to do even less for the East. It looks more like a systemic issue of the political spectrum's relationship towards the East than a passing issue.

My thoughts are also that no long-term government stability will be found in Germany for quite some time, and that is precisely because of all the issues and errors that have accumulated under 15 years of Merkel first and decades of centrist governments eventually. And that's exactly why seeing the whole country so preoccupied with her successor is weird, it seems like it is turning a blind eye towards all of these issues and how the political opinions an necessities of many people have changed.",Italia,/r/europe/comments/jz0lwf/germanys_eternal_chancellor_angela_merkel_marks/gdb3m48/,MrAlagos,1606112190

Also i'm curious as to how many examples are necessary for it to be enough for you. Here's a few more though.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemenite_Jews

&gt; In the late 1160s, the Yemenite ruler 'Abd-al-Nabī ibn Mahdi left Jews with the choice between conversion to Islam or martyrdom

&gt; the Ayyubid ruler of Yemen, al-Malik al-Mu'izz al-Ismail (reigned from 1197-1202) had attempted to force the Jews of Aden to convert.

&gt; A note written in a Jewish manuscript mentions the destruction of the old synagogue in Sana'a in 1457 under the rule of the dynasty's founder Ahmad 'Amir. An important note of the treatment of Jews by Tahirids is found in colophon of a Jewish manuscript from Yemen in 1505 when the last Tahirid Sultan took Sana'a from the Zaydis. The document describes one kingdom as exploitive and the other as repressive.

&gt; The Jewish communities experienced a messianic episode with the rise of another Messiah claimant in Bayhan District, mentioned by Hayim bin Yahya Habhush in History of the Jews in Yemen written in 1893 and Ba'faqia al-Shihri's Chronicle written in 16th century. The messiah was acknowledged as a political figure and gathered many people around him into what seemed to be an organized military force. Tahirid Sultan Amir ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab attacked the messiah, killing many Jews and crushing the movement. He saw it as a violation of the protection agreement and liquidated the Jewish settlement in Hadhramaut as collective punishment.

360,"You are confusing the today's Liberal Democracy with the ancient Greek Democracy. Yes the Greek Democracy was literally the power of majority. Even if it is a revolutionary idea in its own time, it is not ""democratic"" enough for 21st century. Today's western democracies are called liberal democracy where the power of majority is constrained by the limits of the constitution to protect the rights and liberties of the minority. This system is preserved by the separation of the powers to avoid what is happening to Turkey today. A single man who says that he is elected by the majority and he can do whatever he wants, is called tyrant. I can say that Turkish Democracy is much more similar to ancient Greek Democracy than today's western democracies. 
Another person in the comment section talked about how Trump is elected, yes it is a great example of what I said. In his administration we all witnessed how the court many times overruled the unconstitutional decisions of him. What I like about America is their distinct and strong separation of the powers.

Funnily enough, when they film the fantastic beasts in London, the reason they built a whole section of Paris for the second film rather than go and film there, apart from the reasons listed above, was because of the cost of insuring the actors filming on mainland Europe.

Quite far from ""hive mind"". You need to read up on communism, if for no other reason to know what you're opposing.

As for anarchism:

&gt;Anarchism is a political philosophy and movement that is sceptical of authority and rejects all involuntary, coercive forms of hierarchy.

503,"&gt; Austerity is a very germanic value and a balanced budget is very well recieved in Germany, she is German chancellor at the end. Imposed austerity (and loans) probably saved Greece from bankruptcy and much needed reforms are already showing effects now. Regarding Covid, you save up budget and loan capacities for major crisis, that is the case now.

Such as? Greece has a debt-to-GDP ratio of 187.4 % - all the current indicators would suggest that it is still - after all this time - unsustainable. Sure in an abstract sense Greece could do with reform. Just as any country could. But reform for the sake of reform is all rather pointless. 

The moralising of what is a complicated systemic issue plays well on this particular subreddit. It panders to the preconceived bias of European liberals. Germany as the Swabian housewife, Greece the sinner seeking penance condemned for its profligacy. It's narrative, nothing else. 

The crux of the problem lay with the euro and hinges on what is essentially a balance of payments crisis.

Greece had ceded monetary sovereignty. Hence the exchange rate could not be used to adjust exports/imports. Normally if there is excess imports, the exchange rate falls. This causes imports to be more expensive and exports more attractive.

With a fixed exchange, this is not an option.

There's the added diversity of the individual nation-states too. Ideally the rate of interest can be adjusted as it concerns macroeconomic balance and the balance of trade too can be adjusted via the exchange rate.

With monetary uniformity, the proper response a government ought to take is handicapped.

A hypothetical. What if Germany - facing inflation - wants interest rates to rise while Spain - dealing with recession and high unemployment - would prefer them to fall? The problems are systemic in nature. It has less to do with southern spendaholics (as this sub might have you believe) and more to do with systemic problems inherent in the eurozone and a failure on the part of the EU to properly reform.

Don't even get me started on the nonsense that is 'internal devaluation'. 

'Convergence' has been just as much of a joke. So what do we have now? 

A Fiscal Compact that hinders what a government can do regarding necessary fiscal responses during contraction. A type of monetary union again handicapping the nation-state from acting. A central bank with a remit that is far too narrow. All thanks to frau Merkel.

559,"&gt;So they want an omni-powerful leader, not a parliamentary democracy nor actual party dynamics. Just a person. 

What are you on about.

I strongly dislike the CDU with a passion, but even I voted for Merkel a few years ago, because she has proven to be a great negotiator ***despite*** her parties internal antics. She is also far from omnipowerful and Bundestag/Bundesrat still carry out a VAST amount of the governing processes.

""Mutti Merkel"" is something that was born out of the fact that for the longest time, barring a few missteps, she had a humane way of leading the country through a varietly of hardships, even if that meant going against her party line or the general sentiment. She was also a symbol of underrepresentation, being a female East-German Scientist, who was chosen to lead the country by her skills not her appearance.

Since Germany after reunification needed stabilization badly, Merkel was a great choice. Merkel **is** stability. Agree with her or not, but Germany has rarely been that stable both economically and socially. 

The CDU was the strongest party for 50 years. Entirely democratically. Since she's as centrist as they come in a centre-right leaning party, she's the obvious choice for a leader both her party and her opposition could at least agree with. Since the CDU looks like it is finally, slowly, losing its grip over Germany, her amending politics aren't as needed as before, combined with the fact that facing climate change and a heating political climate, stability is no longer the biggest maxime you want.

&gt;""still want"" part, as so many people coming from her same party and values have gotten so loudly rejected.

None of those have much in common with her way of doing politics, which is why they're getting rejected. 

Her first designated successor, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, was/is a warmongering lunatic and misstepped a staggering amount in interviews in just a few months, earning her the nickname AKK47. 

Söder is seen as an appeasing opportunistic popularist and he's also from the exclusively Bavarian fraction of their party-union, making people fear for a Bavarian-Centric policy.

Röttgen is as backwards as they come concerning modern topics like environmental or societal causes and is precisely not what people want for a future-looking chancellor.

Merz has been very tonedeaf in economical causes and considers him self ""middle class"" with an annual income of a million €.

Spahn is controversial because he's a ""young"" gay man in a very conservative party and seen as naïve. He's also had some controversial legislation going on.

In short, none of her potential successors in her party have the same unabashed human outlook on politics, or have proven they can act futureproof and in an equally calculating manner. Conservatism is losing ground to green activism in Germany, and the next election might be a tipping point as to where we're heading. Which is why anybody that isn't basically perfect is not accepted widely. A feat which got even harder because Merkel lead by example for 15 years.

Merkel wasn't a leader without fault in these 15 years. But she always conceded to a democratic purpose (see: Same-Sex marriage) and was always a human focused polititian, which is rare to find in a conservative party.

571,"&gt; I just checked another response and he thought I was saying that Jihadism is the number 1 cause of death in France I think.

Yeah, I also read that. I guess they just don't know English, lol.

&gt; Have to say though that's definitely not the case for Europe as a whole.

I don't think listing a few countries is going to give a clear answer here. Britain, France, Spain, and Belgium are the european countries most affected by Islamic terrorism. (I'm excluding Turkey, because it is an islamic country, which makes it difficult to distinguish between islamic and right-wing terrorism) In Norway for example, the last 20 years saw 78 deaths due to right-wing terrorism and none due to islamic terrorism (mostly due to the 2011 Norway attacks in which 77 people were killed). I would have to see Europe wide numbers to make a conclusion.

Another common issue with right-wing extremism is that it is often not classified as such by the authorities. In Germany, for example, the 2016 Munich shooting was only classified as right-wing in 2019. Another example is the terror series by the National Socialist Underground from 2000 to 2007 which was allowed to go on for 7 years, because the police did not even consider the idea that it could be right-wing extremism. (Sorry for only listing German examples. I simply don't know as much about other European countries)

Firstly who exactly chooses who is considered educated and well versed in politics? Can anyone honestly say that every single person who has - let’s say - a degree from a university is more adequate in choosing a better candidate than an uneducated person? I can assume that there are “uneducated” people out there who can probably grasp politics even better than an educated person. I mean it’s definitely possible. So how do we decide whom to include and whom to exclude from voting? And who is capable enough to make that distinction.

Secondly is a morality issue. Since the leaders chose what to do in regards with all the population, can we morally exclude some people from voting, but at the same time let them reap the benefits or suffer the consequences of the leaders’ actions - the same leaders that they weren’t entitled to chose?

Lenin certainly was aspiring to communism, yes, and also an authoritarian, at least partially. he was leading the USSR for two years, compared to Stalin's three decades as dictator. so the question is, how much of Lenin's thinking actually shaped the politics of the USSR? I honestly don't know, but I don't think one actual communist as a founding father of the USSR justifies a statement about the overall course the entire state eventually took. which was genocidal, totalitarian and absolutely abhorrent, don't get me wrong.   
communism doesn't necessarily exclude authoritarianism, don't get me wrong. but it's a logical fallacy to then turn this around and say it always includes it, just because the most popular examples of it chose this specific path.

Source for that? Because most people who use the 100m argument base their data on The Black Book of Communism, which has been criticized, even by co-authors, for inflating numbers and straight up making a whole lot of shit up. 

Plus the argument itself is moot, because it ignores the fact that capitalism has been, and is even today, more bloody, oppressive and violent than communism ever has. And then people like to compare fascism and communism as if that was a fair comparison, but that's dumb because fascism operates within the confines of capitalism. Let's talk about imperialism in Africa, Asia and Latin America. Let's play the morbid game of counting deaths and go back to the time capitalism first bloomed. See how many people died in the French, American, British, Spanish or any other burgueoise revolutions and how many more have suffered and suffer to this day from imperialistic oppression.

953,"I’ll bet most similar ceremonies around the world have some sort of historical background though, just like in the example of San Marino. The context doesn’t *have* to be monarchy related, that part just happens to be the case in the UK. At the end of the day you don’t see tourists flocking to see Wal-Mart security staff change shifts.

Now people do visit museums to see remnants of past eras yes. But don’t you think people would be even more excited at the opportunity to see *a living person* from the renaissance era? While the British Queen certainly isn’t 4 centuries old she is part of a tradition that does span back quite a while, and do retain some characteristics (and depending on the situation do dress and talk like they used to back in the days). It’s kind of like a living museum exhibition in a way, and that’s something a significant number of tourists do dig. Especially if they’re interested in the Victorian Era, which is a fairly popular and well (if not overly) represented part of history.

From our dialogue so far you seem to have a noted distaste for monarchies in general, and therefore do not see the point of having that aspect of history around. But for someone who’s neutral towards them they can be just as interesting as anything else you’d see in a museum or a gallery.

Besides, GDPR handily fall under ""public policy"", and seeing as it's EU wide, we can ban them in the EU in general. Easy.

For example, a nurse came to my job and anyone who wanted could line up and get it after work. 

Side-effects such as narcolepsy might have happened regardless, since there were so few people affected by that. But just the fact that it DID happen paired with this rushed roll out creates the impression that those are tied together, that if we had acted slower we could have mitigated the negative effects.

This is because they all lived in the area of Kenya nativaly and managed after European colonialism carved them all into one big state managed to get on. Indian's, Pakistanis and Somali's living in England are not native to England.

&gt; Yes. 

No we wouldn't, ironically Czechia doesn't have to deal with what Western, Southern and some parts of Central Europe has too because your governments have kept you safe in that regard but it wont last long in-till the EU higher ups want you to accept more and more migrants, we will see how you feel when large swaths of your country arnt yours nor feel yours anymore ay?

&gt; You wouldn't and you would be wrong for that. Whether somewhere is your  home or not doesn't depend on who else lives there with you. By your  pseudologic you can't call your apartment home if you have room-mate. 

You are miss-construding my words again and straw manning, My argument was if you let someone be your room-mate and then he starts inviting all his buddies in to live there permanently that you never invited nor liked really and then starts changing everything around in and about your apartment to the way he likes where it starts to feel less and less your home and now his, That's what's happening to Western Europe.

&gt; Being majority doesn't mean taking over.

You said “as long at he doesn’t lead the country” The problem is it’s well known that far right nationalist/Neo Nazi parties were one of the main instigators of euromaidan and still play a role in government. In fact it was their actions that made Russian annexation seem preferable to many Crimeans/ South Ukrainians. Extreme nationalism has been on the rise for quite some time. 

Crimeans made up 35% pop in 1890s, 25% in 1930, 20% in 1940... 12% in 2014. tatars been on a steady decline and assimilation for centuries and to say the demographics would’ve been very different had deportation never occurred is a stretch. 

Crimea isn’t “just dry land” It’s got arguably a strategic location, it has cultural significance to Russian history, and most importantly it’s got Russians there that want to be Russians. 

Russians, Belarusians and Ukrainians are in fact brothers and no amount of propoganda on both sides will change that. The current craze of anti Russian west Ukrainians is unfortunately for Russia still very influential and doesn’t seem to slow. Russia is good willed towards Ukraine but must first most serve its own national interests that serve the security of the state. You may not like it but if you understand that Russian actions become clear.",,/r/europe/comments/jy87cs/today_is_dignity_and_freedom_day_in_ukraine_the/gd7yg2a/,imimmunetocovid19,1606055417

Europe essentially destroyed it's economy to save the lives of the elderly. China, through lying and draconian measures, kept on going and either ignores the virus or stumps it out when that doesn't work anymore. Which of these options is more humane or morally correct is not the debate here, but we have to acknowledge the results of each choice.

All of the EU economies are now smaller than China. And Europeans demand further lockdowns because they are used to total safety and security. The thing they are used to since the 60s, all while we already have an aging population and a slowly eroding economy that lost its edge long ago.

Corona killed any chance of the European pension or welfare system working in 20 years. It was something that people could joke about a year ago, but it has become increasingly clear the western system is coming to an end. A dead economy in lockdown can not feed the 60% of the population too old to earn money. With half of these still working being employed by the gouvernment itself.  
An economy where no one sane will create a business in, a society with no children, a system made to suit the interests of 60 year olds with no plan that goes beyond the next 20 years.

Europe pretends to be China's competition while it is merely divided small fry. And there is no solution as well. It's over. I'm not even trying to argue for a solution, because there is none.

1143,"It is impossible to deny that vaccines have had a positive effect on people's health and well-being. However, big companies lie, cheat, cut corners every time they can. Pfizer specifically has a horrible history with their drugs and vaccinations, paying out over 5b USD since 2000 in damages and fines.

While this virus might be statistically a bit deadlier than the flu (although there isn't conclusive evidence that the current strain of the virus is at all), the average age of deaths with COVID in most countries is above 80. The likelyhood of you dying if you contract COVID is smaller than you dying in a car crash if you're under 50 years old. As such, all this fear about this disease is overblown.

You cannot be responsible for any other adult's health. It is up to them to exercise, eat healthily and spend enough time outside. If they do these three things, they're safe from the disease.

You can be responsible for damaging someone else's health, however. You can't run people over, shoot them on sight or beat them up. You can give them an airborne infectious disease though, and let me tell you why : Because it's not provable that YOU specifically gave them the disease. It's an unprovable crime (you can be presymptomatic for weeks, how are you going to prove that someone you were in contact with gave you a disease? Not to mention once again, the virus is airborne, it can stay around for weeks in the air) with no clear victim (there's a over 50% chance they're going to be asymptomatic) and without a culprit. PCR tests also aren't accurate enough to be used in a court of law.

So the argument of ""you might give it to someone else"" is null.

I ask you all again, and I believe that if you are capable of navigating to a comments section on the internet, you are capable of thinking for yourself and understanding data and logic,

do you want to take a vaccine, for which the company making it gave up all responsibility, the company also has a **history** of selling unsafe medication and vaccines, AND it's the first vaccine in the history of mankind to be developed for a disease that's been around a year?

I won't. I got vaccinated for a lot of other stuff, but I won't get vaccinated for COVID. I'll keep living my life like I used to, because there isn't enough statistical evidence that I shouldn't.

1243,"&gt; What means ""Manifest intention to threat the physical/mental integrity"", it's been discussed at the assembly and confirmed : It's when you post the name/adress of the policeman, or if you post a threat like : Go beat him up/Find this bastard and kill him, or whatever threat.

Then what the law should say is ""when a person posts address information of a police officer online or incites violence"" both of which I would assume are already punishable offenses anyway. Yet the law still says ""physical and mental integrity"" which, despite the fact that members of parliament may have said something about it, leaves it very much open to interpretation of the judiciary.

1502,"Genbu is a large tortoise or turtle combined with a snake. The word tortoise is not used for his name, because it was also used as a slur in China. So this euphemistic name was used to refer to the Black Tortoise. His name comes from Chinese mythology, where it is associated with the Taoist god Xuan Wu (the Chinese pronunciation of Genbu).

Xuan Wu was a prince who lived in prehistoric northern China. He lived in the mountains, far from civilization, where he studied Taoism as an ascetic. He learned that to achieve full divinity, he would have to purge both his mind and body of all impurities. While his mind had become enlightened, he still had to eat earthly food, and so sin remained in his stomach and his intestines. So he cut them out and washed them in a river to purify them. When he did this, his stomach turned into a large demon tortoise and his intestines into a demon snake. The demons began to terrorize the countryside. Xuan Wu subdued them, and instead of destroying them he allowed them to atone for their sins by serving him. They became his generals: a snake and a tortoise.

Genbu is associated with yin energy—the forces of darkness and shadow—and in ancient China was worshipped as a god of the moon (another strong yin force) in addition to being the god of the north. Because the shell of a tortoise is like a suit of armor, Genbu is also viewed as a warrior deity. The tortoise shell is a symbol of heaven and earth, with the flat part of the lower shell representing the world and the dome of the upper shell representing the heavens. As tortoise shells were a popular tool in divination, Genbu was also viewed as having soothsaying powers and the ability to travel between the lands of the living and the dead. The tortoise is a symbol of longevity and immortality, while the snake is a symbol of reproduction and multiplication.",Where at least I know I'm free,/r/europe/comments/jyllv5/accidentally_stumbled_upon_this_small_church_in/gd5r7ny/,executivemonkey,1606018955

“The Prime Minister then returned to the question of Poland and said he was not asking for any agreement nor was he set on the matter but he had a statement which he would like to have the Marshal examine.

This statement suggested that Poland should obtain equal compensation in the West, including Eastern Prussia and frontiers on the Oder to compensate for the areas which would be in the Soviet Union.
(...)
Marshal Stalin said that if the Russians would be given the northern part of East Prussia, running along the left bank of the Niemen and include Tils[i]t and the City of Königsberg, he would be prepared to accept the Curzon Line as the frontier between the Soviet Union and Poland.

He said the acquisition of that part of Eastern Prussia would not only afford the Soviet Union an ice-free port but would also give to Russia a small piece of German territory which he felt was deserved.

Although nothing definitely was stated, it was apparent that the British were going to take this suggestion back to London to the Poles.”",Lesser Poland (Poland),/r/europe/comments/jy9gdk/kaliningrad_russia/gd62mzo/,JozefRetinger,1606023227

But this bill doesn't fit that pattern. It would, if it actually did what many fake-news and click-bait titles falsely claim, i.e. forbidding the filming of policemen… but that's actually not the case:

The bill neither forbids filming the police nor does it forbid publishing the footage on the internet… it just asks for the faces to be blurred then. In other words: The only thing it does forbid is doxing them (which puts their lives in grave danger: doxed teachers aren't the only ones who get murdered, there have also been cases where doxed police personnel got murdered in France).

And one can hardly make a point for a right to such doxing to be a measure of liberties. What is a fundamental liberty, the right to film,  publicly document (including on internet), and to bring to justice police violence (in fact that's even a civil duty, and in that case the raw footage can be used as providing that as evidence at a court of law is not doxing), is not affected by that law.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/jykgsr/tens_of_thousands_of_people_protested_in_france/gd5g4cb/,DarkSiderAL,1606013167

The usual rule is as follows:  in the big cities it's normally safe, especially if you are a woman, to wear rainbow stuff.  I would think that in most pubs - especially those the large selections of microbrew'd beer (e.g. hipster places) - no one would give you any grief.  However, past midnight - when people have been drinking for several hours - it'll start getting a bit questionable and by 2 am you'll definitely need to keep your wits about you.  However, that's really not so much an anti-gay thing as it is a regression by our semi-evolved simian citizens into not-at-all-evolved simians.  There's a chance that they'll go after anyone that's obviously different.  Brits/Germans, PoC, gay, Jews/Muslims, etc.  And this is all mostly if you're a guy.  If you're a woman then you'd probably be fine.  The aforementioned semi-evolved simians are perfectly happy to beat the hell out of each other and men, but I think it is rare for them to assault strange women.

1681,"I'm not sure if there's much modern application for tankettes.

I think that the tradeoffs just weren't worth it.

IIRC there is one somewhat-modern tankette that someone in Europe makes...lemme see how many were exported.

*googles*

Looks like it's just Germany's Wiesel.  I thought that someone had something newer than that, but I guess not.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiesel_AWC

And even there, it's essentially only Germany operating it, and it's a specialized vehicle for airborne troops.

It looks like after an attempt to use the [M551](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M551_Sheridan), US airborne settled on the [LAV-25](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAV-25), which is wheeled rather than tracked.

China seems to be doing the same shift:

https://www.strategypage.com/htmw/htsf/20200616.aspx

&gt;Since the late 1990s, China has been relying less on light tracked combat vehicles and more on wheeled versions.

So I'd kind of guess that even countries that use airborne armor -- which is the reason that Germany did the Wiesel -- probably aren't heading towards building more tankettes.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/jy7z05/poland_to_build_new_generation_main_battle_tank/gd5gt95/,duisThias,1606013594

1691,"This law does not forbid filming policemen. It doesn't even mention filming or blurring or anything like this. This law forbids publishing the face or personal details identifying a policeman in a manifest attempt to cause harm to policemen. It also contains a specific clause that it does not cover case which falls under the right to inform (that means journalism, and possibly whistle-blowers or people witnessing illegal activities that should be revealed to the public).

That means you can publish video with their faces if it's to denounce police brutally for example. What you can't do is to publish their face to doxx them. Like publish a picture, say ""this is Robert Pinot who lives at 134 Boulevard des Poulets"" and ask people to go teach him a lesson.

From a legal point of view there's not much that a court could do to sentence someone without extremely clear proof that he published content in the precise aim to harm the policeman. In French criminal law the burden of the proof falls on the prosecution, not the defendant, and is appreciated in very strict terms by the the judge (especially as the law specifies it should be a ""manifest attempt""). So let's imagine that you cause harm to a police officer by publishing info on him, you couldn't be sentenced as long as there's no proof that you did it on purpose. No judge will sentence anyone without clear proof.

However the law still poses a big problem acdording to its opponents:

* Firstly they argue that the current laws are already enough to prosecute and sentence people who deliberatly try to cause harm to police officers by giving private details. They consider that this law actually serves a different purpose: to please police unions ; to appeal to right-wing voters who favors tough law and order policies ; to restrain the publishing of videos showing police brutality.
* Secondly because, as we've already seen multiple times, police officers tend to disrespect the right of protesters to film and often illegal ask them to stop filming, take their phones or destroy them. This new law would give them a sense that they are right to do it, even though they are still not allowed to so.
* Finally, it could increase self-censorship by protesters and journalists who don't want to take the risk to be detained and face a trial.",France (Alsace),/r/europe/comments/jyd89w/protesters_rally_in_france_against_macrons/gd5ha5g/,CaptainLargo,1606013889

It's really amazing how many people can't look up simple facts.
&gt;

Plug are designed to be used by humans. Convienience matters. Being reversable is incredibly useful for people who work a lot with plugs. For people who work a lot with plugs conveinience matters a lot. With a mass manufactured product that has widespread technology the additional effort of making plug reversible is worth it as it is very useful.",,/r/europe/comments/jx0z0f/thought_this_would_be_interesting/gd4v6km/,Skaarj,1606004918

1861,"&gt;Toronto gets only 200 h more sun annually, because the benefit of longer days in Helsinki in summer isn't fully compensated by longer days in Toronto in winter.

The difference in annual sunlight hours is due to weather. Without it, Helsinki would get more sun annually because it's closer to the Arctic Circle. From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunshine_duration):

&gt;atmospheric refraction allows the Sun to be still visible even when it physically sets below the horizon. For that reason, average daytime (disregarding cloud effects) is longest in polar areas, where the apparent Sun spends the most time around the horizon. Places on the Arctic Circle have the longest total annual daytime, 4,647 hours, while the North Pole receives 4,575. Because of elliptic nature of the Earth's orbit, the Southern Hemisphere is not symmetrical: the Antarctic Circle, with 4,530 hours of daylight, receives five days less of sunshine than its antipodes. The Equator has a total daytime of 4,422 hours per year.\[2\]",Finland,/r/europe/comments/jycjk9/same_latitude_cities/gd4ccv5/,L4z,1605997595

1893,"Yep, you're right. It plays nowhere near as a central role in our identity as Basque does. Basque nationalism, like Wales, has always been led by native Basque speakers. There is no nationalism without the language. Whereas in Ireland, there have always been nationalist movements, but they rarely placed an emphasis on language until the height of the struggle for independence.

While I do think this is unfortunate, it was inevitable. Irish nationalism could never have been built on a language which was not spoken by most people and was associated with poverty. Had it been so, the majority people wouldn't have been attracted to it. Despite the language being incredibly important to me, it's not as important as independence. I'd imagine in the case of Welsh and Basque, the choice would be the opposite.

I do actually think the Gaelic Revival had massive success in changing attitudes towards the language. Before it was marginalised at best, completely forgotten about at worse. While they didn't succeed in reviving the language, they did manage to make people much more aware of it.

Scotland is a completely different case. While with Ireland you will find broadly positive attitudes and the more nationalist people will be very supportive of Irish, no one cares about Gaelic in Scotland. I was recently at a talk about the importance of our native languages between the youth groups of Sinn Féin, Plaid Cymru and Misneachd, the only Gaelic language advocacy group. Notice how there wasn't anyone from Young SNP.

This is for a variety of reasons. One of them being that Gaelic was the never the language of all of Scotland and even in areas it used to be spoken, it was a long time ago. While I do have some hope for Irish, it's difficult to ever imagine Scotland placing emphasis on their native languages.",Ireland,/r/europe/comments/jy9a71/very_sad_to_see/gd4djb1/,Eurovision2006,1605998015

That can't be true. The ""niece"" was a Yugoslav collaborator. I already watched a video of her almost crying how bad were the Bulgarians and how she was treated in a Bulgarian prison. Only Yugoslav collaborators went to these prisons. No wonder why she later became a secretary of the first Yugoslav president of ""independent"" Macedonia.

I already gave you a quote from a guy who met in person with Gotse when he said ""We are all Bulgarians"". It doesn't matter where he wanted to be buried. He identified as a Bulgarian living in Macedonia. It's also logical for him to want to be buried at his birthplace. Duh...

Georgi Dimitrov was working on the Macedonization of Pirin and wanted to give it to Macedonia for exchange of Bulgaria joining Yugoslavia and he had the plan to replace Tito. Dimitrov was one of the worst leaders we had and in most people's eyes he has the status of a national traitor. I already sent you a video about this. Why don't you watch it?

""Finally, Krste Misirkov, who had clearly developed a strong sense of his own personal national identity as a Macedonian and who outspokenly and unambiguously called for Macedonian linguistic and national separatism, acknowledged that a 'Macedonian' national identity was a relatively recent historical development. In On Macedonian Matters, published in 1903, Misirkov, referring to himself and other Slavs of Macedonia in the first person plural, admits repeatedly that ""our fathers, grandfathers, and great-grandfathers have always been called Bulgarians"" and that ""in the past we have even called ourselves Bulgarians"" (1974:27, 150).""

""And bulgars had khans, not tsars and kings."" That's what you said and it's completely wrong. Even if you say that ""uh Simeon was Slav not Tataro-Mongolo-Turko-Asian"". He was part of the Krum dynasty, which was Bulgar :

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krum%27s\_dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krum%27s_dynasty)

Bonus - Look at the medieval illustration of Krum who was first a Bulgar chieftain in Pannonia. Does he look East Asian to you?

About the rest of the paragraph about the Bulgars. You have a very basic understanding of the topic. The things are not so clear as you think and definitely not as black and white as ""Bulgars = Turkic = Mongol = not Bulgarian"". And also very biased, by the way. I can't really blame you for that, because Macedonia has been Serbia's lap dog between 1913 and 1991. You know who started the ""Tatar"" thing? That's right :

[https://books.google.com/books?id=mp5JDwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PA139#pg=PA139%23v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false](https://books.google.com/books?id=mp5JDwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PA139#pg=PA139%23v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false)

""The Serbian views on this matter also presented the Proto-Bulgarians as wild ""Tatars"" who conquered a large group of Slavic (i.e., Serbian) tribes and created a mighty ""barbarian"" state during the Middle Ages. These ""Tatar-Bulgarians"", however, reduced their ethnic presence to only the northeast corner of the Balkans (i.e., Dobrudza or Scythia Minor). The rest of the territory continued to be inhabited by Serbians or ""Serbo-Bulgarians"" (Milojevic 1872).""

By the way, the medieval language was Bulgarian as you can see clearly from the people who you presented as ""Macedonian authors before 1840"". The medieval country was called Bulgaria. Not Macedonia. Macedonia was part of Bulgaria and obviously the Bulgarian sphere of influence. That's why you speak Serbified western Bulgarian dialect, have the same holidays, the same folklore, the same names, and almost the same gene pool(obviously geography plays a bigger role here).

I know what Bulgarian means. I think that I already told you. The Bulgarian identity started forming in the early 9th century when the Bulgarian Empire made the Orthodox Christianity, Slavic language, and the Cyrillic script as official. We carry these cultural traits to this day. You also do(wow big surprise). If we are going to talk about genes, then it's way more complicated and you can't really talk about ""genetically pure nations"" in the Balkans. I think you get why. Maybe we have a significant amount of DNA from the Bulgars. Maybe we have 1%. The Bulgarian identity that culturally unifies Bulgars, Slavs, Thracians, Illyrians, Paeonians, Celts and other people groups who lived here began forming in the 9th century. That's the same identity that was used to build up the 3rd Bulgarian country from the ashes. You obviously carry the same cultural traits and as mentioned almost the same gene pool, but ironically you chose a way more ancient name to call your country and people, because of reasons. Here is something about the genetics :

[http://www.academia.edu/14205263/Genetic\_data\_for\_17\_Y-chromosomal\_STR\_loci\_in\_Macedonians\_in\_the\_Republic\_of\_Macedonia](http://www.academia.edu/14205263/Genetic_data_for_17_Y-chromosomal_STR_loci_in_Macedonians_in_the_Republic_of_Macedonia)

&amp;#x200B;

""The Macedonian population has the largest genetic distance

against the Croatian population (0.2643), while the lowest against

Bulgarian population (0.0815) (Table 4).The neighbor-joining

consensus tree constructed based on the results of the genetic

distance analysis shows that the population of the Macedonian

ethnic origin has possible highest similarity with the Bulgarian

populations, and not such dissimilarity with the cluster which

consists Bosnian and Herzegovinian-Serbian-Croatian populations,

while the Kosovo population create a separate group (Fig. 2).""

I believe it's the same for cops. A few years ago, I was witness of a police intervention (a drunk guy attacked random people on the street and had to be forcefully restrained).

Throwing money at the consumer wouldn't have affected that. Giving more money to the workers after the factory closes down doesn't help them. It just delays the problem.

If your road doesn't allow 1,50 meters of distance for overtaking, then it doesn't really matter if they are riding next to each other, which is legal too by the way. Honestly, if you cannot overtake a car there, then you cannot legally overtake a bike either, but 99% of all cars will still do it, often aggressively cutting you off (or worse).

There was little political will to do it because the first decade after 1921 was about stabilising the country after the turmoil from 1916 to 1922. There was equally little money to invest in a language when cities and infrastructure had to be rebuilt. 

People were disinterested in a language which had no obvious economic benefits. You cannot leave school at 16 fluent in Irish and emigrate to the US, Australia or the UK speaking Irish. No hope of a job. 

Then there was the educational system ran by the tyrannical religious orders who beat Irish verbs and prepositions into pupils from the age of 5. My great-grandfather was beaten in school for speaking Irish during the 1910s by teachers while his children were beaten in school for speaking English in 1930s. 

Why learn a language with little investment which is useless and associated with misery? 

In category, it is possible to start from 2022 a push to become a truly bilingual nation. All primary school teachers must be fluent in the language and that begins the generational shift. However, little political will.

So either you are really picky or you are lying. Also i can play the same card against you. If all greeks are against turks then turkey is against greece. The eez dispute is backed by the entire turkish people. The Hagia Sophia conversion also. Maybe you do hate all of greek people. The difference is i didnt state as a fact that you are a turk so you must hate greeks. I dont know you you dont know me. Lets try to be civilized and talk about things casually. No need to descredit me for literally caring for my future. Also greece is european like it or not. We dont pretend to be. We are in all case senarios. That is why have place in the parliament. I know that you dont see it on the news but many european leaders in the parliament are greek. I understand that you wouldnt care about eu unless it has turkey in it but many legislations in the eu pass with greek support. Also hating germany hasnt been seen like in half a decade. For me right now turkey is doomed and not a threat. Maybe a war will break out but it will acomplish nothing. Turkey under erdogan is a paper tiger. Erdogan has done to many mistakes. Allienated eu, conversion of Hagia sophia from an economics perspective it stupid,you picked a fight with france and erdo slured macron for no reason, Eu sanctions coming, usa sanctions coming, The s 400 was a big plunder costed you f-35. I dont hate turkey not erdogan because there is nothing to hate. Greece currently holds the cards not turkey. Just to understand the incompetence of erdo he made the 3+1 east med pipe an alliance. He made a nonexistent project (realisticly at least) to greece- israeli alliance. The biggest economy in the east med is now helping your ""enemy"". What is to hate?

2272,"Yes. They teach about Molotov-Ribbentrop treaty.  
Also, they teach that a year before there was the [Munich agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_Agreement) where England and later France and Italy signed papers on cooperation and non-aggression with the Nazis This agreement was signed after such a ""nonsignificant historical event"" as Germany, together with Poland, attacked Czechoslovakia and occupied its territories while the USSR called on Europe to unite against Nazi aggression and to stop it in the embryo, but there was no reaction, only Poland said it would declare war on the USSR if they try to help Czechoslovakia.  


They also teach what two years earlier, in 1936, a [civil war broke out in Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Civil_War) between the forces of the republic and the fascist loyalists, which eventually led to the [Franco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Franco) dictatorship and the nationalist government. I hope you know about [Francoist Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francoist_Spain). From the very beginning of the conflict, the USSR called on Europe to unite against the growing Nazi ideology in Europe, but also nobody cared much.

&amp;#x200B;

Also in Russian schools, they teach that in 1931 the [Japanese invaded Manchuria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_invasion_of_Manchuria), which some historians consider as a real beginning of the world war, which entailed the growth of nationalist forces in the world and the [full-scale Japanese-Chinese war of 1937](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Sino-Japanese_War), which became the forerunner of conflicts in Europe.

&amp;#x200B;

The Russian school teaches that the Second World War is a very complex phenomenon that is rooted in the [revanchist sentiments of German society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revanchism#Germany) that arose after the inglorious defeat in [1918](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I), therefore hat's why the society eventually brought so radical Hitler to power, which promised to return the former greatness of Germany and for the same reasons that's why the country so easily fell into the Nazi ideology.  


Russian education teaches all these stages, therefore, not a single person from Russia would agree that the USSR unleashed the war. From the point of view of the Russian people, the USSR called for the unification of Europe against Nazism since 1936, but in 1938, the Western European countries themselves didn't condem Germany after the [partition of Czechoslovakia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_occupation_of_Czechoslovakia), and Germany, having received a non-aggression pact with England and France, began to move east, therefore the USSR decided that no one wants to unite and there's no reason of waiting for the rest of European countries. Soviets reassured after 1938 that western Europe wants to put the Nazis and Communists against each other in the east and they began the expansion to Finland and the Baltic States wanting to prepare for the inevitable war with as much buffer territory as possible, hence the [Molotov-Ribentorop Treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molotov%E2%80%93Ribbentrop_Pact) that took place only in 1939 at the very last moment as a desperate attempt to stop the German advance into the east and the possible war, because the USSR would not have survived a week against the entire military force of Nazi Germany.  


The USSR from the point of view of Russian education was cornered and made every attempt to turn the Nazis away from their borders. And in fairness, that's exactly what Britain did with France a year earlier during the Munich Agreement. They turned Germany east on the same principles: to avoid war with Germany at any cost.

  
And, by the way, this is confirmed even by photographs from this topic, because despite the fact that the Germans in 1940 offered the Soviets to join the axis, this did not happen and Ribbentrop, after the visit to Berlin, went to Moscow the next day without the agreement. Later they sent impossible demands to Germany and Hitler began to prepare for the eastern front. Exactly like the USSR  was actively preparing for the war all these years untill Germant attacked it in 1941 which called in Russia ""[Great patriotic war](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%92%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%8F_%D0%9E%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%87%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F_%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B9%D0%BD%D0%B0)"" i.e Eastern front of the WW2 *(just follow the link and change the language to English.

Straight from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Dresden_in_World_War_II#Military_and_industrial_profile):

An RAF memo issued to airmen on the night of the attack gave some reasoning for the raid:

&gt;Dresden, the seventh largest city in Germany and not much smaller than [Manchester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester) is also the largest unbombed builtup area the enemy has got. In the midst of winter with [refugees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee) pouring westward and troops to be rested, roofs are at a premium, not only to give shelter to workers, refugees, and troops alike, but to house the administrative services displaced from other areas. At one time well known for its [china](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porcelain), Dresden has developed into an industrial city of first-class importance ... The intentions of the attack are to hit the enemy where he will feel it most, behind an already partially collapsed front, to prevent the use of the city in the way of further advance, and incidentally to show the Russians when they arrive what [Bomber Command](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAF_Bomber_Command) can do.[\[36\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Dresden_in_World_War_II#cite_note-FOOTNOTERoss2003180-37)[\[44\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Dresden_in_World_War_II#cite_note-FOOTNOTELongmate1983333-45)

In the raid, major industrial areas in the suburbs, which stretched for miles, were not targeted.[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Dresden_in_World_War_II#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMcKee198362-9) According to historian [Donald Miller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_L._Miller), ""the economic disruption would have been far greater had Bomber Command targeted the suburban areas where most of Dresden's manufacturing might was concentrated"".[\[45\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Dresden_in_World_War_II#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMiller2006a437-46)",,/r/europe/comments/jy5igc/christmas_market_2019_dresden_germany/gd1ueto/,Monsi_ggnore,1605961396

Wikipedia:

"" In 1936, after seeing the paintings Hitler submitted to the Vienna art academy, [John Gunther](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gunther) wrote ""They are prosaic, utterly devoid of rhythm, color, feeling, or spiritual imagination. They are architect's sketches painful and precise draftsmanship; nothing more. No wonder the Vienna professors told him to go to an architectural school and give up pure art as hopeless"".[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paintings_by_Adolf_Hitler#cite_note-gunther1940-6)

One modern art critic was asked in 2002 to review some of Hitler's paintings without being told who painted them. He said they were quite good, but that the different style in which he drew human figures represented a profound disinterest in people.[\[17\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paintings_by_Adolf_Hitler#cite_note-17)

In a report entitled *The Water Colours of Hitler: Recovered Art Works Homage to Rodolfo Siviero*, prepared by [Fratelli Alinari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fratelli_Alinari), Sergio Salvi rejects the characterization of Hitler as ""a grim Sunday painter"" and describes him instead as a ""small time professional painter"" of ""innocuous and trivial urban landscapes"".[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paintings_by_Adolf_Hitler#cite_note-ColottiMariani5-1)""

2590,""" Cuz the country experiences a brain drain and strong emigration ""

Why isn't the the brain drain happening now? I will tell you. It is. And it is much worse than in the past. Because when people live in authoritarian state, they don't believe it by default. That is why people in Usa are the most brainwashed ones. 

"" Yes! But those communist apologist do not represent the majority of the population (I said before that they are around 50% of the elders, and for sure they keep dying). ""

The polls aren't limited by the age and they still are more than 50% in most Usrr republics, besides baltics and Poland I think, but yes more older people believe in it, because they lived through it so yes I do believe them.

"" Free trade and democracy are bullshit so we should return to an authoritarian regim that still believes in free trade? ""

I didn't say that democracy is bullshit. But yeah free trade is harmful. Ussr didn't really believe in free-markets. They had some portion of the economy in it, but most was still centrally planned.

"" they acknowledge the fact that the life condition in the past were on pair with the present one or worse, they praise the social order crated by the state?""

Most polls are EXACTLY about the living conditions and they say that life conditions were 1. better 2. the same 3. worse, in this order, besides Poland and baltics of course. 

"" You're a state capitalism supporter? Make me understand : you think it's better because the top will make sure that the plebs don't revolt as long as they live a decent live? This can not be said about a democracy that believes in free trade? You're willing to open that Pandora's box that enables the state to have unprecedented power? ""

I am not a state capitalism supporter, however if I had to chose between free market capitalism and state capitalism it isn't even close. Everything you say already happens. State dissent is silenced in free market ones, especially through propaganda, but if not this, then you have the american gestapo kidnapping people from protests. I prefer state having power, than corporations yes. Obviously. Corporations only care about profit. States, even the most totalitarian ones, still need to make lives of people better.

france is playing into the hands of the terrorists, not just france all of the west. its astounding how a bunch of poorly trained and ill equipped religious zealouts keep outsmarting the wealthiest part of the world.

the muslims in france i dont doubt do a feel bit persecuted these days. the dumbest thing the french government did recently was the muhammed cartoon projection.

it would be fine if citizens did that, but the government did that. that was the government taking a clear and concise stance on insulting a part of its country.

that was incredibley stupid, and all it did was worsen the situation.
i feel the debate in france regarding this issue has lost a lot of its nuance.

look up what can and does cause religious extremism in the west. its similar to gang mentality.
young men feel excluded and left out, feel they suffer from racism and or discrimination and they arent really part of the country.
coupled with limited job prospects that can and does radicalize someone.

know i havent followed everything completely, so i dont know every word macron has said regarding this issue.
maybe he has taken a nuanced and concilliatory tone.

&gt;Marty: ""What do you mean, Doc? All the best stuff is made in Japan.""

&gt;Doc: ""Unbelievable.""

This is one of my favorite quotes from a movie. A quote made even more relevant by comments I've seen in this very thread. Fabled, high quality Japanese manufacturing didn't materialize in a single day. The quality of products from Japan and South Korea rapidly improved as they industrialized. 

In the 1950s (as in BTTF 3), Japanese products had a reputation for being low quality ripoffs that owed its success to ""unfair trade practices"" and ""rampant IP theft"". From the 1960s-1990s, Taiwanese, South Korean, Singaporean and Hong Kong products inherited the Japanese reputation. 

From the 1990s until around 2015, it has been China. The next countries that will inherit China's reputation will be Vietnam and Indonesia.",ASEAN,/r/europe/comments/jxwllt/largest_freetrade_blocs_in_the_world_by_combined/gd0rtvr/,throwaway_firstie,1605937359
2763,"Dresden, city, capital of Saxony Land (state), eastern Germany. Dresden is the traditional capital of Saxony and the third largest city in eastern Germany after Berlin and Leipzig. It lies in the broad basin of the Elbe River between Meissen and Pirna, 30 km north of the Czech border and 160 km south of Berlin. Sheltering hills north and south of the Elbe valley contribute to the mild climate enjoyed by Dresden.

Dresden is distinguished by the celebrated art museums and classic architecture of its reconstructed old town. Completed in 1743 and rebuilt after WWII, the baroque church Frauenkirche is famed for its grand dome. The Versailles-inspired Zwinger palace houses museums including Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister, exhibiting masterpieces of art like Raphael’s “Sistine Madonna.”

Dresden originated as the Slav village of Drezdzany, meaning “Forest Dwellers on the Plain,” on the Elbe’s north bank. First mentioned in 1216, the town on the south bank was founded at a ford by Margrave Dietrich of Meissen as a German colony. The Slav settlement on the north bank, although older, was known as New Town and the later German town on the south bank as Old Town.

Dresden has a long history as the capital and royal residence for the Electors and Kings of Saxony, who for centuries furnished the city with cultural and artistic splendor. The city was known as the Jewel Box, because of its baroque and rococo city centre.

Before World War II, Dresden was called “the Florence on the Elbe” and was considered one of the world’s most beautiful cities owing to its architecture and art treasures. During the war, however, it was almost completely destroyed by massive bombing raids that took place on the night of February 13–14, 1945, by an Anglo-American force. The raids obliterated much of Dresden and killed thousands of civilians; various postwar estimates placed the death toll between 35,000 and 135,000 people, but in the early 21st century an official German commission concluded that up to 25,000 had perished.

The city was so badly damaged that it was suggested that the best approach might be to level the site. After the war a compromise was reached by rebuilding the Zwinger, the Saxon royal palace, and the Baroque buildings around the palace and creating a new city in the area outside. Much of the city was subsequently reconstructed with modern (though rather plain) buildings, broad streets and squares, and green open spaces, with the aim of preserving as far as possible the character of the old city.",Romania,/r/europe/comments/jy5igc/christmas_market_2019_dresden_germany/gd0rxpl/,filosoful,1605937443

2774,"&gt;You can’t control your borders on continental Europe.
That doesn’t appear to be true. The nations of EU and Schengen still have complete control over their borders and can require quarantine or whatever they feel is necessary including restricting entry. Hell, even Scotland can restrict entry from the U.K.

Of course those countries are islands. That was my point. Between closing borders, universal masking and effective contact tracing, they have gotten things well under control. European countries have sovereignty over their borders and could have eschewed tourism for safety, but they didn’t and now’s there’s a big, collective pikachu face that there are similar rates of new cases as in the U.S.

Unfortunately there is no physical or legal infrastructure to close state borders in the U.S. It’s questionable whether a U.S. state has the authority to close their borders and there are no checkpoints set up to do that. The federal government has no authority to enforce mask wearing. It really comes down to each local jurisdiction whether mask wearing will be enforced or not. Many sheriffs, who are elected not hired, said flat out they won’t enforce Covid rules. The legal structure of the U.S. is particularly unsuited to this kind of situation.",,/r/europe/comments/jxij0j/wipes_sweat_from_brow_alright_everybody_back_to/gd0sku4/,Candelent,1605937955
2775,"&gt; This kinda thing not sure if too useful doesn't really give insight into underlying structure and comprehensiveness of agreements.

RCEP's core focus is on tariff reduction (87% across the board) but still less comprehensive than Obama's TPP (99.9% on all products). It is impossible to aspire to too much with RCEP because you have impoverished nations like Laos and Cambodia alongside manufacturing powerhouses like China and Japan. Notably, core growth sectors for certain countries remain [protected](https://asia.nikkei.com/Economy/Trade/China-s-RCEP-tariff-concessions-still-guard-growth-sectors) and have a longer phase out period. 

The previous Obama-led TPP also had extremely onerous clauses on signatories who were developing countries. Obama pushed very hard for what was essentially US IP laws to apply tio the participants. Labor laws were also very strongly regulated under the TPP, which are easy for capital intensive economies like the US and Japan to conform to but harder for lower-middle income countries like Vietnam that rely on labor-intensive jobs to power their economies. 

&gt; Pretty sure South Korea has FTA with NAFTA members that are more comprehensive than RCEP so in a way they're more integrated into that then RCEP so should they get put into the Nafta bloc or RCEP or both?

SK signed an FTA with NAFTA as a bloc but that doesn't make SK a constituent part of NAFTA. 

Last year, Singapore and Vietnam both signed FTAs with the European Economic Area. Singapore and Vietnam were not made constituent members of the EEA.",ASEAN,/r/europe/comments/jxwllt/largest_freetrade_blocs_in_the_world_by_combined/gd0syke/,throwaway_firstie,1605938265

The plug itself was originally designed to not fail at less than something like 100A which is ridiculous overkill. The thinking was that people would be using plugin electric heaters a lot but that's not how things worked out.

The socket openings for the pins are protected by gates that are opened by the earth pin. This is a clever idea but it's only really necessary because the plugs are so massive.

It is YOU the one that's not making any concessions right here. Because for you it is unthinkable to legalize something so petty, like a flag, because why exactly? Not like it dangers your ""territorial integrity"", as you claim for why you don't give us autonomy. Truth is, it is never going to happen. 0 Romanians support it, not because they think it's a bad idea, but because it feels good to take jabs at the other.

""Yeah, but Johannis sent it back for revision once, and he can't for a second time"" - sure, but we are talking about the country and the hivemind that is it's people right now, NOT about the president.

Also ""Huge fine"" for the president? Yeah right. In a range from 2k to 100k by law, he got fined 5k. If that were a Hungarian, it would be pushing for the upper limits. Tell me about the Uz Valley, I'm not telling you Hungarians weren't at fault TOO for putting trash bags on graves that were put up by a town without administration to the region, but you tell me why were no Romanians fined, when they assaulted the cemetery, vandalized it and attacked those who held hands together to block the entrance? How could court decide that Bacău wasn't outside of it's administrative region when it isn't even in the same county? Same shit as in the 90's on the streets. Point out to me the last time violent clashes happened between two civilized, western-European ethnicities! Tell me why is police force still distributed unequally between Romanian and Hungarian towns in Mureș county? 

Are you really still stuck on 64 County Movement? It may have had something to do with it when it was founded, but it's nowhere near as ""directly"" funded as you claim. Also, it's a RADICAL GROUP if you hadn't noticed by now, they exist, you know? Vatra Românească say anything to you?

You talk of the middle ages like they have the same weight as nowadays. You forget all peasants were treated like shit regardless of ethnicity. You picked the right king, because his father was misled and ambushed by Romanians - I wouldn't blame him for not wanting them in his country. We're in modern times now, let me tell you, everything is changed now, what's accepted and what's not is not what it was 600 years ago - not saying it was correct morally back then either.  
About France and the Germans. Let's see. Public administration in their language? Check. Press and public signs in their language? Check. Education? Until 12th grade definitely. (Been to Strasbourg) Don't know about universities. About politics keep in mind there are less Germans in total in a country that's more than 3 times bigger than Romania, than there are Hungarians in Romania. I don't know their political climate, and while they might not be in the parliament in their own political party, because they are too few in numbers, they ARE represented in the local council.

It says ""colonized or control"", so Ethiopia would fall under that, albeit for very little time, since Italian rule over Ethiopia was rocky and short lived. 

Taiwan had previously been ruled by the Dutch, then Spanish as part of New Spain, before becoming Chinese ruled.

Western Sahara is split between ""colonized"" (for Morocco) and greyed out, not ""sphere of influence"". I suppose the small bits not under Moroccan control are not being counted as a state.

Iceland is generally considered European, while Greenland is generally considered part of the New World due to proximity.

3077,"""lmao who came up with this dumb shit, must be some dumb bugar""

Exactly. ""Dumb"" is kinda rude though. Confused fits better.

What should I answer to? A photo from the Macedonian Wikipedia about a letter to the people born in the region of Macedonia or the supposed ""niece"" of Gotse Delchev that was a communist secretary? I've already answered. You just have to read the quotes. Ivan Vladislav was mentioned as ""Bulgarian by birth"" and Samuil as ""Tsar of Bulgaria"" in the 11th century. The Macedonians were widely considered a regional identity that was part of the broader Bulgarian one. Gotse Delchev identified himself as a Bulgarian. Krste Misirkov wanted a separate Macedonian language codification, but didn't deny the Bulgarian roots of Macedonia and later even fully embraced the Bulgarian identity. You can check that out if you don't believe me. He became a representative of the Bulgarian minority in Bessarabia. The elderly Vlachs living in Macedonia call you ""v'rg'ri"" and have no word in their native language to differ between Macedonian and Bulgarian. The pro-Bulgarian sentiments in Macedonia were still prevalent before WW2 and started dying out rapidly only after the Yugoslav ""Bloody Christmas"" and the propaganda and oppression aimed at bringing up the Macedonian identity and erasing the Bulgarian one. No Macedonian literature existed before the 19th century and authors from Macedonia called their language Bulgarian before the 1840s. The international commission on the Balkan Wars with 3 Noble prize winners wrote a report that included details about the Bulgarians in Macedonia and their struggle under the Greeks and Serbians, while the Greeks still used the legend of Alexander to excuse their occupation of lands with Bulgarian majorities. Sit on your ass and read the quotes. They are not from Wikipedia. They are from books written by professors of history, anthropology, and linguistics from big foreign universities. I know that the truth doesn't suit you, but you can at least try to be a bit objective towards that information.

""And bulgars had khans, not tsars and kings.""

Another ridiculous delusion. Where should I start?

Mauros was a Bulgar leader in Macedonia who was the first foreigner out of the Roman Empire who received the title ""archon"" :

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauros#Byzantine_patrikios

The first person outside of the Roman Empire who have been given the title ""caesar"" was Tervel who defeated the Arabs at their siege of Constantinople :

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_(title)#List_of_holders

The first person who had the Slavic title ""tsar"" was Simeon. Funny thing is that the first tsar was Simeon I and the last person to hold the same title was Simeon II who left Bulgaria after the communist coup.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsar

""The first ruler to adopt the title tsar was Simeon I of Bulgaria.[2] Simeon II, the last tsar of Bulgaria, is the last person to have borne the title tsar.""

3094,""" The remains of what could be at least 15 Albanian Kosovars killed by Serbian forces during the 1990s war have been  discovered in a pit in southern Serbia,  officials from both sides said.

The conflict between the Kosovar rebellion and the Serbian forces (1998-99) claimed some 13,000 lives, mostly ethnic Albanians, but also saw cases of torture with hundreds of civilians displaced.

The regime of Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic tried to cover up war crimes  in mass graves, and the bodies of several hundred Albanians were discovered after the fall of his rule.

The latest were found Tuesday in an open mine pit in the village of Kizevak, 15 kilometers (nine miles) from Rudnica quarry, where a mass grave was also unearthed in 2010.

“According to the information available, it could potentially be between 15 and 17 bodies,”, Serbian Commission for Missing Persons chairman Veljko Odalovic told state television on Wednesday.

“It is assumed that these are the bodies of Kosovo Albanians, but we cannot be certain until we have confirmation of the identities”, Odalovic added.

The teams have so far discovered “the first traces, namely clothes and bones,” he continued, adding that the court had ordered exhumation work to begin on Thursday.

In Pristina, the director of the Institute of Forensic Medicine Arsim Gerxhaliu told the press Thursday he was ready to go to the site to participate in the work.""

The fact that you're trying to put somehow an equal sign between our histories is just....ludicrous. Do you know when the oppression of Romanians started in Hungary? In 1366, when king Louis of Anjou removed the equal rights Vlachs used to have up until then and said this: ""exterminandum seu delendum in ipsa terra malefactores quarumlibet nacionum, signanter Olachorum - to expel or exterminate from this country malefactors belonging to any nation, especially Vlachs/Romanians"". We've been oppressed for religious purposes from back then up until the 19th century when discrimination based on ethnicity started too.

Please show me this happening in France. Or Germany. The answer is it doesn't exist. 

What are you talking about? Romanians are not accused of anything? President Klaus Iohannis got a huge fine for ""hate speech"" against Hungarians when he said that he will never allow PSD to give Transylvania to the Hungarians. Those were his literal words and he was taxed for it. 

Maybe it's time you start to appreciate the things we give you, things that few other countries would offer to a minority. If other Hungarians managed to move on, so must the Szeklers.

3133,"False. Slovenia was far closer to the Austrians and Germans than the Czechs ever were. While the Czechs might have been under German control for almost 1000 years, the Slovenes were under German control for over 1200 years, uninterrupted, mind you.

In fact Slovenia and Austria are so close that Slovenes were under Bavarian control before Austria even existed. Yes, more than half of the land the Austrians live in today was Slovene, in fact it honestly isn't inaccurate to say that Austrians are just German speaking Slovenes. We were the first Slavs to be Christianised and the first Slavs to be Germanised. Unlike all of Austria's other conquests, Slovenia was already a part of Inner Austria when it formed. Slovenia, unlike the other Slavs, shares two states with modern Austria. Slovenia was the only non-German speaking region to be included within the Austrian circle. Even today, 100 years after WW1, Slovenia has been a part of Austria for longer than half of the actual states of modern Austria.

I'm sorry, but being the peasant servants of the Austrians is just about the only thing us Slovenes have going for us. Don't you dare try and steal it from us!",,/r/europe/comments/jxa2h9/europe_at_the_height_of_nazi_domination_19411942/gcz5sv3/,Beurua,1605903784

3141,"&gt;forbidding muslims from making non muslim friends

&amp;nbsp;

Are you talking about this verse?

&gt;""O believers! Take neither Jews nor Christians as guardians—they are guardians of each other. Whoever does so will be counted as one of them. Surely Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people."" Quran [(5:51)](https://quran.com/5/51) 

&amp;nbsp;

The footnote from https://quran.com/5/51

&gt;Wali means guardian, caretaker, protector, provider, ally, etc. The Prophet (ﷺ) for example says, “A woman should not get married without a wali.”—that is a guardian such as her father to represent her in the marriage and make sure she receives her full rights. The verse forbids Muslims from allying with the Jews and Christians (or anyone else) conspiring to persecute Muslims. On the other hand, as long as non-Muslims are not at war with Muslims or persecuting them, the Quran [(60:8)](https://quran.com/60/8) commands Muslims to be kind and gracious to them.

&amp;nbsp;

Here is Quran [(60:8)](https://quran.com/60/8)

3175,"&gt; Home rule and autonomous jurisdiction are the same thing, no?

No. It is only the same if Home rule includes autonomous jurisdiction and Greenland only have limited autonomous jurisdiction or do you not make that distinction in english?

&gt; Iceland actually was one of the few places in the world that was never colonised - it had nobody living there until the current population arrived there.

Irish monks known as the Papar properly lived there, when scandinavians decided to settle there. Also settling an area where no one else is living is also normally seens as colonization.

&gt; Greenland's history is interesting - Scandinavians colonised it, then they died out there. And now the Inuit live there, only. There's nobody left who is a descendent of the original Vikings who discovered it, they all died before the Inuit arrived. Modern Danes have moved there in very small numbers, but they only arrived recently - in contrast to Icelanders they are not of Viking descent. Iceland and Greenland have nothing at all in common.

I am not sure if you are getting your ethnicities right. Greenlanders live in Greenland. Many Greenlanders do not see themself as part of a pan-inuit group.

The Turks are a nomadic tribe from Asia who conquered the Greek lands, this is the only thing that makes them ""Europeans"". Russia was originally a European country, which in the course of history has seized a huge territory in the east.

EU membership requires all member country to resolve their conflicts with other EU members, and Turkey cannot be part of it until they give in to Greek demands concerning Cyprus and Armenian's demands to acknowledge their conflicts with the Turks during WWI as a genocide of their people.  Neither is something Turkey is willing to do, and EU membership isn't vital to Turkey's economy since being part of the Customs Union is enough to sustain Turkey's economy.

3464,"&gt; There is a big difference between trying and doing something, I think.

I agree. But in this case, the only notable difference I see is success and failure, not intention or morality.

&gt; What island?

The PLC colonized both a part of Gambia and Trinidad and Tobago for a little while but like I said later sold them as they just couldn't afford colonization. Is this not taught in Poland?

&gt; In the times, when Poland was strong and rich enough to have colonies it was simply not interested in it, because it had different interests, mainly in eastern Europe.

Well no, that's not it. Poland was never as wealthy as the major colonial powers even at the height of the PLC. If you consider the 16th or the 17th century to have been the Polish golden age, it was definitely not as wealthy as Habsburg Spain, France, Austria, Portugal or later the newly independent Dutch Republic and even England or Sweden by the mid 17th century. It is the same kind of mistake people historically do with Russia. But size does not convey the hierarchy of great powers in Europe at all. Even a moderately wealthy state such as England in the late 16th to mid-17th century (so at its colonial beginnings) thought colonization to be too costly.

Regarding the start of WWI - I don't know what exactly your collegues say - but Christopher Clark makes well-reasoned arguments in his book ""The Sleepwalkers"" that every major power played a role in its outbreak and in the tensions that preceded it, with no nation bearing sole responsibility and no nation being free of blame.

I know that the Austrian Empire transcended nationality. German nationalists wanted to abolish Austria to join the Prussian Germany - but they were not the majority (that the people wanted to join Germany immediately after the loss of WW1 was born out of desperation and not the sentiment that they had during the time of the Austrian Empire). Those that weren't nationalists still considered themselves to be German - and I see myself in their tradition and not in the tradition of the nationalists.

You see, the ancient Greek had two words to describe a people - demos (citizens, or nationals) and ethnos (the ethnicity). Yes, generally, ""German"" is nowadays used to denote German nationality, but no other term has come along to describe what amounts to German ""ethnicity"" and thus I still consider the use of ""German"" correct in that context.",,/r/europe/comments/jvpe7x/european_regions_as_proposed_by_ständiger/gcxyhdf/,Borcarbid,1605882380

3526,"Due to its variability, renewable energy works much better with a large grid. UK investing a lot into wind energy is good for the EU too, because it will mean a major source of wind power for the whole continent. I am very glad to hear news about UK wind energy growing.

Eventually we might have a situation along these lines: It's a windy day and UK has a lot of wind energy, so it sells it to France. France sells its nuclear energy for example to Spain, which is having a cloudy day and not producing as much solar energy as usual. Next week, it is sunny but not windy, so Spain sells solar energy to France, and France sells nuclear energy to UK. Or UK can sell wind energy to Norway, which will use less hydro and instead has the dams and reservoirs fill up, and when it is not windy, it will use that hydro and sell the energy back to UK. 

It is a group effort and some countries are doing better than UK and others worse. For example, France has a lot of nuclear energy and has lower emissions than UK, has had for a long time. There are some EU countries that are still holding the EU back, however, such as Poland which still refuses to accept even a net-zero-by-2050 plan for the EU.

Women generally have more personal time ( pregancy for example)
Men are harder and less willing during negotiations. 
Men on average work more hours
Woman are less inclined to go for the carreer. So they tend to pass on promotions. 
Does this also account for vastly difference in payment in different field. For example; Im a technician, I have a lot benefits due to dangerous work, working with dangerous materials ( explosive gasses, etc) 
From the 80 guys I know work my field. There's only one woman. She makes the same as everyone else but she barely gets the physical demanding jobs because she cant execute those very efficiënt. ( lifting 80kg while holding a drill, is possible for 2 guys. With Celena, its usually a nightmare. )

They think Boris Johnson will resign some time next year. I'm not sure of it myself.

Whether he resigns or not, I think we are losing some of the appetite for populism, and he now has to adapt to that.

The general mood on the left is as divided as ever. Pro-Starmer vs. Pro-Corbyn (who is now without any parliamentary power). The Labour party has always been split into centrist and leftist factions. Starmer in other circumstances would be set to do well, but the issue of Scotland and the SNP makes it more difficult for him than for Blair. Whoever replaces Johnson won't be so easy to embarrass either.

The most left-wing Labour supporters will probably go and join various other parties, like they did under Blair, or focus on activism outside of the parliamentary process. They are not happy to say the least.

Of course German, English or French cultures were more developed but same applies to them as well to varying extent.

Finland was very sparsely populated, mostly rural and never had developed that much indigenous culture as more populous areas of the world. Also the population of Finland was only several hundred thousands so even slight migration or cultural influence had major impact on people living in Finland. 

And yes you are right that there is a big difference between east and west Finland. That is mostly due to transportation. Western Finland was more connected to Sweden as maritime transportation was much easier.

War, poverty and hunger sealed the Habsburgs fate, The successor states and their elites needed a founding myth and had to radically depart from the past. So the story of the dysfunctional doomed Empire is part Entente propaganda, part nationbuilding after the fact. Both Brittain and France and the new states had an interest in depicting their new status quo as just and natural.

It is all well today, but the story told really needs to be scrutinized as it stands in conflict to the developments within the Empire in its last decades.

4240,"Again, you talked to tourists. Tourists didn't pay their tickets. It's in no way indicative of what Romans do or don't.

Your waitress clearly talked bullshit or she is one who likes free rides. The simple reason I'm so sure that locals in your bus had paid is cause as a tourist you were in the tourist parts, center of the city. Locals who live there are as rich as rich goes and definitely don't need public transportation. So the locals must have been commuting. Commuting to the city center means using the subway system. You can't enter a subway station without a ticket. See? Easy.

Plus excuse me, but tell me why would any Roman buy single tickets for each ride. Each ticket coasts 1.5 euros and lasts 1.5 hours. Let's say your commute lasts less than that you'd be paying 3 euros a day for the two tickets (going and coming back). So 15 euros a week, as I guess one would work 5 days. Which means 60 euros a month. 60 euros a month and only two tickets per day, let's say you want to spice it up and you need to move anywhere else too, you'd need even more money. A monthly subscription is 35 euros and unlimited rides. An annual subscription is 250 euros.

Yeah, you never saw a local with a ticket on a bus because they had a subscription. A subscription doesn't need to be tapped entering the bus. There you go.

Bus drivers don't check because there's too many people. Still, it doesn't mean you can just use a public service without paying for it. 

You were an asshole. Other tourists who didn't pay were assholes. Any Roman who doesn't pay (and that only works for buses, you must pay for the metro) is an asshole and also a minority.

Again, you were not clever, you did not do the right thing and your original comment in which you said that Romans don't pay for their bus rides is false, offending and hypocritical.",,/r/europe/comments/jx3p4f/how_quality_of_life_changed_in_european_capitals/gcvn0aa/,nymeriasgloves,1605824494

You invent terms like “significant nation”, compare Poland to South Korea in stead of Nations close to it historically and culturally.

Europe has killed each other for 2000 years. There is so much blood under the bridge, so much animosity under the surface. Without a rule based interaction we are bound to make wars again. EU has seen a period with unmatched peace and growth in Europe.

But anyway, if we go by that logic, then Slovenia would be ""awarded"" all of Carinthia, Styria, southwestern Vas and Zala counties, and Trieste. Because these lands have all been historically inhabited by the Carantanians, the ancestors of modern Slovenes. But that obviously didn't happen.

However, the Slovenes were fighting for just a tiny fraction of Carinthia, in which they held a 90% majority. The Yugoslav's wanted to put the border on the Drava river, which would approximate the ethnic border relatively well. Instead, the Entente opted to force a referendum, which included a larger area with non-Slovenes, which obviously worked out in the Germans favor.

In comparison, Sudetenland, which was awarded to the Czechs, was roughly the size of Belgium (1.5x bigger than all of Slovenia) and had a German population of 90%. Somehow, the Entente decided that it would be awarded to the Czechs, without a referendum.

Patriots want best for their country and this guy is traitor, he wants our country disappear and be occupied by Russia, because russian grants feed him good. I despise people like him.

He's trying to bullshit people with lack of historical knowledge using words like ""русин"", hoping that people will associate it with current Russians. But current Russians were called ""московиты"" then. ""руська мова"" is not russian language, but Old Belarusian and Ukrainian and so on. Never trust the traitors. 

&gt; You accepted that your religion was changed but ""it's OK, it's even better"".

Uniatism is good for Belarus because it represents our national character. We are bridge between Western Europe and Russia, we are mediators. We understand both sides and connect them. Church must talk in national language. Catholics in Belarus understand it, ROC does not. Belarus always was place with tolerance to all people, Christians, Jews, Muslims, etc. Things that ROC preaches that they are the only right religion makes no sense. Orthodoxy was used by russian tsars to occupy GDL. Tsar would proclaim himself responsible for protection of people with the same faith and use this vague reason for intervention and occupation. Not much changed through the centuries. Now you hear same type of blatant lies from Russian officials that they want to protect ""russian speakers"" in Ukraine that's why they occupied Donbass. Rhetoric like that cause rejection and counteraction, f.e. Baltic states decided to stop Russian channels to avoid people learning Russian language. Stupid policy that backstabbing those ""russian speakers"".

&gt; Your language was not official

Wrong.
The Statue of GDL is written in Belarusian.

You can download it from rutracker and read yourself.
All official documents in GDL were written in Old Belarusian. It was language of law. 

&gt; Your main claim to Russians is that ""previous occupants fed us better"".

No, my claim is that it doesn't matter what occupant, it still occupant. We don't think that Confederation with Poland was occupation though, but recognize that this influence was not good for Belarusian culture. But russification with direct prohibition of language and killings of writers was even worse. Belarus must be independent of occupants and ruled by Belarusians, not foreigners. At the same time we want to keep good relationships with all our neighbors.

&gt; my language

It's not your language exclusively. Belarusians invested in developing Russian language not less than you did. It was litwin Yan Fedorovich, who learned the trade from our famous
Francysk Skaryna who printed first book for Muscovites. Piotr Mstislavec who helped him was also litwin.

4541,"It's a touchy subject. We Slovenes consider the Carantanians to be our ancestors, and the lands of Carinthia and Styria, which they inhabited to be our cultural heritage. 

Slovenes have historically been the majority in these two regions. Naturally, their numbers declined under the thousand years of German rule. However, just two centuries ago, Carinthia and Styria still had a very strong Slovene majority in the south. My guess is that advances in communication infrastructure combined with an increased pressure to conform led to the state of things we are familiar with at the start of WW1. 

I really hate politics. The western part of Slovenia was promised to Italy in the Treaty of London in 1915, with no respect to ethnic lines. When the SSCS gained independence, we had to fight to get Lower Styria. Eventually, this was given to us on the basis that that Slovenes constituted the majority of the countryside. Soon after, Yugoslav forces occupied Carinthia too. After the Entente decided that this was inconvient to them, they decreed that the fate of Carinthia will be decided on the principal of self-determination. The outcome of the plebiscite was that the Slovenes, who formed the majority of the countryside, didn't even win Zone A.

I don't know about you, but this is very hypocritical and self-contradicting to me.

Then of course we get to WW2. Our lovely northern neighbors tried to wipe us off the face of the Earth :-). Personally, I think Carinthia would have been fair compensation. But of course, after Yugoslavs once again occupied the region they were forced to turn back by the Allies, since they decided to resolve Austria of all blame and pin it on Germany.

I find the Nazi ideology and connections of some Carinthian politicians to be quite frankly, disgusting.",,/r/europe/comments/jwzlyw/where_europeans_lay_claim_to_neighboring_countries/gcuawom/,AvidLangEnthusiast,1605802951

4619,"&gt; continuing to fund what it funds at the moment

Many of these things are not continuous, but project based. Take research as a concrete example. The next budget targets something like 100B€ research funding over the 7 years. There is then a whole strategy on dividing that money into different areas with strategic objectives and ultimately a schedule for calls for proposals. Consortiums then send proposals and some number gets funded. Without a new framework budget none of that will happen as it's not something they can just ""continue"", they have been designing a whole new setup for the next framework duration.

On the other hand, it would be trivial to fund it outside the EU. In fact there have been non-EU states that have paid into it in order to get access for their researchers (which will undoubtedly include the UK in the next round). It would just mean the 25 pay into it directly, and Polish and Hungarian researchers cannot bid for projects (unless those countries decide to buy in themselves). The same mechanism could be used for other major areas of funding too.

This would of course make the EU Parliament and some other institutions pointless, since they would be looking after only a bare-bones EU budget for administration, while most of the money is controlled by separate agreements between the 25.

&gt; That isn't what Poland and Hungary are doing though

What are they doing then? It is their right to veto a budget if they don't like, as it is the right of the Dutch to veto as well. It is important for protecting net payers that the basic principles of rule of law are respected by everyone, including Hungary and Poland. Otherwise they cannot justify the payments to their taxpayers/voters. It is also within the rights of the 25 to make direct agreements that leave out Poland and Hungary, leaving EU proper with a skeleton budget.",,/r/europe/comments/jwgqlu/dutch_will_not_compromise_despite_hungary_poland/gctwrte/,rhombioid,1605795599

4745," 

&gt;From 950 to the 15th century the territory of modern-day Serbia was mostly under Byzantine influence,

so was Russia. Its called Orthodox christianity.

&gt;following the fallout of the Battle of Kosovo the Ottoman Empire seized control and with the fall of Constantinople in 1459

1453, but Serbia was under the ""influence"" way before. It became a legit part soon after.

&gt;So while they were Slavs, it is a very strange idea to say that they are bound ""by blood"" to Russia. (Besides the fact that it is a very strange idea to be ""bound by blood"" to anybody else than direct family.)

Big no no. It is a huge topic till today, for some 200 years. In Serbia, most of all slavic nations. Its no longer just bound by religion, language and alphabet. They emphasize the blood bound the most. If you dont understand it, look at all their neighbours and guess why they hate them. Its because of these things.

As a Czech, we have more in common with Germans (because of shared history, culture and also 30% of our population were ethnic Germans), than other slavs (except the language), but we have lot of minorities from ex-yugoslavia, that fled the war, so its quite easy to receive their point of view.

They are the most nationalistic european slav nation, even more than Poland.

&gt;Nationalism was a big argument, however, the cause was mostly political. At the beginning of the 19th century, the Ottoman Empire lost its influence in the Balkans and therefore a power vacuum came to be that forced all the nations around to take a stance.

But there were balcan wars for a while there. Also fueled by nationalism. Also parting of Ottoman Empire (like Crimmea, North Africa, Aegean islands).

I agree that one of the reasons for the war was who will control Balkan, which from the empires PoV had nothing to do with nationalism.

&gt;So while nationalism certainly played a role for the official reasoning of Russia's behaviour (and for advertising to their own people), they wouldn't have followed through if that was the only reason for them to act.

Russia never acts on nationalism and never did. They dont care about their ""small brothers"", as they call us, never did. 1968, when their tanks came to teach us manners will forever stay in our memory. They even claim, they wanted to help Czechoslovakia, when they were attacked in 1939 by Germany and Poland (because we had defence alliance pact), but Poland said no, so they didnt :D Official source- Russian ministry of Foreign Affairs. (I cannot link this, because its on Facebook, wtf reddit?) I can send you link to DM

&gt;In conclusion: Political motivations have been more important for Russia and for Serbia when it comes to determining their relationship. Ideology, nationalism and pan-Slavism played a part here, but questions of political influence and power have always trumped every emotional argument.

I agree with Serbia and their relationship towards Russia. In the opposite direction - not at all. it is only one informal channel, how they can influence the region and cause it to destabilize further (their overall goal in world politics for a while).

[Study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4868614/) after [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20196710/) after [study](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-6817) have demonstrated that the use of the surgical mask for risk reduction in Covid-19 contagion is questionable to say the least.

That's not what I was refering to, though. I was refering to the obvious fact that the lockdowns cause far more damage than the damage they're supposed to prevent. The economic and social damages caused by locking down an entire country and closing countless businesses is astronomical, whereas the benefits are anything but obvious.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; There was not one expert on the issue among the leaders of the protesters. 

That doesn't mean that none of them based their opinions on experts.

There's more than a few medical doctors, microbiologists and other expects in relevant fields that have spoken out the Covid-19 hysteria and the totalitarian measures allegedly taken to stop the spread of this virus. 

Professor [Dolores Cahill](https://www.boffinaccess.com/immunology-and-immunobiology/editorial-board/dolores-cahill/a8abb4bb284b5b27aa7cb790dc20f80b), Dr [Sucharit Bhakdi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sucharit_Bhakdi), Dr  [Wolfgang Wodarg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Wodarg), Dr [Didier Raoult](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Didier_Raoult) &amp; [John Schulpen](https://prevenzis.nl/john-schulpen/) are just some of the many, many, many experts who have expressed disagreement with the mainstream position, which seems fuel mostly by political rather than medical concerns.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Their only COMMON goal. Stop misenterpreting me and maybe it'll make sense for you. 

If I'm misinterpreting you, then maybe you should try to be more clear.

And, again, what do you base this on that it's their ONLY common goal?

It seems to me that preventing Europe from being turned into a police state controlled by the World Economic Forum and their cronies is a goal that share as well... and one they share with anyone who has any clue whatsoever on [what is really going on here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRPQqfwwuhU)!

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Yeah, because unlike COVID-19, they are not highly infectious diseases that spread exponentionally in an unregulated environment.  

So?

Why does it matter whether COVID-19 spread exponentially, when most people have a survival rate of &gt;99.5% and you can perfectly quarantaine ONLY those with a lower survival rate.

We're not talking about the bubonic plague or the Spanish flu here. We're talking about a condition that almost everyone who gets it will survive.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; If there's not enough doctors to take care of the hospitalized patients and not enough lung ventilators, the death toll will rise rapidly - even among younger people. 

If we need totalitarian measures to prevent hospitals from overflowing, why didn't this happen in Sweden?

Why was there little to no excess mortality at all in Sweden between the start of June and the start of the second flu season?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; There is a number of different mathematical models that predicts this 

And there's quite a few experts that disagree with the speculating models used by the fearmongers to scare millions of people into submission!",,/r/europe/comments/jwceyo/every_year_on_17_november_both_czech_republic_and/gctmtu7/,johnslegers,1605788890

1917-1921 Russian Civil War/Ukrainian War of Independence: Although the First world war wasn't over yet eastern Europe was severely ravaged by the civil war between the Bolsheviks and Mencheviks while the rise of nationalism  let to wars between the now independent Ukraine, Poland and a border conflict with Romania. The capital Kiev was occupied by 7 different armies in 4 years time. 

1920-1931 Start of a brutal totalitarian soviet regime.

1932-1933 Massive man-made famine by Stalin which led to the death of millions (2.5 to 7 million people died) and the complete disruption/destruction of nearly all economic activity.

1933-1941 Continuation of the brutal totalitarian soviet regime which was industrializing at a rapid cost in human lives and citizen well being. 

1941-1945 Second world war, although Belorussia would see greater destruction and depopulation the Ukraine wasn't far behind and both the soviets in 1941/42 and the Nazi's in 1943/44 would employ scorched earth tactics ravaging the country side.

1945-1991 Continuation of a brutal (less so after Stalin's death in 1953) totalitarian soviet regime which led to a stagnated inefficient economy which would eventually collapse in every part of the USSR and all of it's east-European satellite states. The Ukraine itself was actually one of the more prosperous USSR republics but it was nothing compared to western-European countries. 

1991-2004 A newly independent Ukraine, which was still pretty much in Russia's shadow, tried to transform it's planned-economy to a market economy with some success.

2004-2014 Greater political turmoil and eventually a revolution.

2014-2016 Russian occupation of Ukraine territory in the Krim. Civil war in the eastern parts which resulted in a more or less successful cease fire (no major engagements or shifts in territory) and continuing uncertainty.",,/r/europe/comments/jwz3j1/gdp_per_capita_of_european_countries_compared_to/gctmv14/,mighij,1605788917

France annexed Straßburg 1681, during peacetime, without justification, other than ""we want to secure our recently annexed alsatian territory"", taking advantage of the Turkish belligerence that bound the Imperial military on the other side of the Holy Roman Empire.
And then they forcibly converted the protestant inhabitants and expelled those that would not comply. Do you really think that the Germans of the time cheered to all that?

&gt;but form Saxon, to Frisians, to Prussian, etc... ""true"" germans were never culturally nor ethnicaly united before Bismarck (which to be true more or less imposed prussian culture over the Reich)

Again, either you failed the history education, or the french history education failed you. What do you mean with ""true"" Germans? Who decides what a ""true German"" is? You? The French state? The ""Rassenpolitisches Amt der NSDAP""?

What do you think the Holy Roman Empire was, if not a union of mostly German lands? Yes, ""German lands"" - that is the term that the minstrels of the 11th and 12th century use. And yes, there were other non-German parts too, but it was already predominantly German. And no, a people does not have to be united in a nation-state (a modern institution anyway), to exist as a cultural and ethnical entity. One can be a Saxon and a German, a Frisian and a German, a Bavarian and a German at the same time. ""German"" is just the wider term that describes a multitude of narrower identities.

France didn't let Alsace and Lorraine vote after the first World War, even though Woodrow Wilson insisted on it, because they were afraid that they wouldn't vote to join France.

First of all, that [varies considerably.](https://ourworldindata.org/mortality-risk-covid) [And it's a bit more complicated than that.](https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/estimating-mortality-from-covid-19)

Now, consider that in an unregulated environment, where the disease spreads exponentially, it would take a few weeks to affect &gt;90% of the population.

There are around 5 million workers in Czechia. [Their average age is 43](https://www.trend.sk/spravy/priemerny-vek-pracujucich-cesku-zvysuje-nezamestnanost-vsak-klesa). Death rate for people aged 18-65 would be around 0,5 % IN THE BEST CASE SCENARIO (considering hospital capacities are not full, which is impossible).

That's 25 000 deaths in a few weeks.

For some reason you forgot about the rate of the hospitalized people, and the rate of the **sick people unable to work**, which is around 50%.

4787,"Spätburgunder is the German name for Pinot Noir, which is a famously fragile and thin-skinned, and that doesn't especially lend itself towards big and bold, especially not when grown in cold climates like Burgundy of France, or the German Rhine regions, like Baden or Ahr. 

&gt;I meant that even a dry Spätburgunder is a lot ""sweeter"" than say a Barbera from Italy which are rather sour.

Compared to Barbera, almost every other grape is less sour, as the Barbera grapes have a naturally high level of acid in them. 

&gt;A Primitivo for example seems comparable to a Spätburgunder in most ways, just has a richer taste.

Primitivo is a completely different beast, as the grapes have much more tannin, less acidity and are much more suited for warmer climates, such as California, Croatia and Southern Italy. 

It's the archetype of a ""hot-climate"" grape, whereas Pinot Noir is the same for ""cold-climates"" grapes. You really can't/shouldn't compare the two, as they try to be very different things. Primitivo/Zinfandel/Crljenak Kaštelanski is all about being big, bold and assertive, while especially French and German Pinot Noir/Spätburgunder aims to be more elegant and delicate. 

Whether you like that or not is a question of personal taste, but neither of them are ""better"" than the other, just like bananas aren't a better fruit than a peach is for example. 

&gt;But I'd be up for any recommendations on ""excellent"" Spätburgunders in the 5-15€ price range

But worth a deeper look:

For example I would have said services for UK

A quick google using 2018 data for the UK as an example suggests that the original map data is using manufactured goods only (with the UK split of services v manufactured goods being roughly 50:50 in recent years).

Of the manufacturing segment, cars were top at £33bn (10% of manufactured goods so maybe 5% overall).

Depending how you split down the categories (service or manufacturing) and sub categories it could skew the data.

E.g the related sub categories of financial services + banking maybe be less than cars separately but more when combined... but cars + mechanical equipment might be more than banking + financial services.

All in all a nice post to think about but needs context, an understanding of the categories and more data!

Google does a lot of tracking, which many people don't want, so they use alternatives to their services. Using AMP, they can track you even more, and they might even replace ads with their own, stealing ad revenue from the site's owners.

4882,"All kinds of fish are killed as a bycatch, even sharks:

&gt;Bycatch accounts for about half of global shark catches. Longlines are mostly responsible, but bycatch in nets is also important. In the Pacific Ocean alone, 3.3 million sharks are caught each year as bycatch on longlines. Indeed, in terms of numbers, sharks are the most significant bycatch species in the world’s major high seas fisheries. They are also particularly vulnerable to over-fishing due to their relatively slow reproductive rate, with several species showing recent drastic declines.

&gt;Blue, hammerhead, shortfin, mako, thresher, and great white sharks are among the species most affected by bycatch. In the north east Atlantic Ocean, for example, 89% of hammerhead sharks and 80% of thresher and white sharks have disappeared in the last two decades as a result of bycatch. Deep-water sharks are also increasingly at risk.

&gt;If the possible extinction of Tigers gives you concern, stop eating lamb

This is a stretch, but not killing all the deer is important for reintroduction of wolves, for example. Back to the topic of oceans, I think it's also important to also mention that fishing is the biggest source of plastic pollution in oceans.

4993,"Being Dutch, this seems very obvious to me. First we need to take into account that rivers deposit fertile sediments and the Rhine valley is naturally suitable for agriculture, so it's wanted real-estate. Most travel of goods in the past went over rivers and so there is a cultural continuum of sorts along the river from Leiden up to the Swiss mountains.
The reason the Low Countries and Switzerland are countries is because they are hard to navigate. In the case of the former that has to do with numerous rivers and (formerly) huge areas of swampland preventing getting across the terrain quickly, while Switzerland of course has the mountains. Otherwise, the Rhine valley is easy to take by military force from either side. So there's a recurring theme of the river basin having a driver of cultural unification (travel up and down) but being invaded by more marginal (agriculturally speaking) societies to their west and east. And as I mentioned, then you end up with independent states in the delta and mountains, and a culturally distinct but eternally besieged middle region. 
It also explains all the hangups about where the Netherlands belongs on this map: the Rhine is the centre of gravity in Western Europe and the Low Countries, Western Germany, Eastern France and Switzerland belong to it. Divvying up those regions in this map never fully makes sense.

Lastly, there's a pretty big cultural difference between the Netherlands along the coast, which have more historic ties with the Hansa, the UK, Hamburg, etc. while the Southern Netherlands from the big rivers (Rhine, Maas, IJssel, Scheldt) downwards have more culture in common with the Rhineland and Northern France.",,/r/europe/comments/jvpe7x/european_regions_as_proposed_by_ständiger/gct9dfi/,denfryenkerl,1605775233

5062,"An endangered shark is at risk of going extinct after the EU blocked the UK's first independent conservation vote.

The Mako shark, which is the fastest in the world, is facing rapid decline due to being fished despite being endangered.

 Known by fans as ""the cheetah of the sea"", it can reach speeds of up to 43mph and is often seen jumping at dizzying heights from the sea to look for prey. The athletic animal has won admirers including Ernest Hemingway, who detailed an encounter with the Mako shark in The Old Man And The Sea.

The shark has declined by 99.99 per cent since the 19th century as it is is sought for meat, fins, and sport. Slow growth makes them exceptionally vulnerable to overfishing. Makos are fished by many nations around the globe yet not subject to international fishing quotas. 

Ministers have said they are frustrated after a motion by the UK, Canada and Senegal to ban the fishing of the sharks was voted down by the EU and the US.

Lord Goldsmith, the International Environment Minister, told The Telegraph:   ""We are pushing for stricter protections for mako sharks, and I'm disappointed there isn't a consensus on this issue. The UK has co-sponsored a proposal for a ban on landing these important endangered species at the current ICCAT annual meeting.

 “As a newly independent nation, now able to speak in these global forums in our own right, we will continue to make the case for greater protection of endangered species – on land and in the ocean.”

The EU is the biggest culprit when it comes to fishing the creature; boats mostly from Portugal and Spain are responsible 65 per cent of all reported catches of shortfin makos in the North Atlantic.

The vote took place at the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT). Canada, Senegal, and — in their first official act as an independent ICCAT Party —  the United Kingdom proposed a ban on retention of seriously overfished North Atlantic shortfin makos, as ICCAT scientists have long advised. 

Scientists from the Shark Trust, a UK charity which has been working with ministers on this issue, have warned that the species could take five decades to be brought back from the brink of extinction, even if fishing were to cease immediately.

“North Atlantic mako depletion remains among the world’s most pressing shark conservation crises, yet the EU and US put short-term fishing interests above all else and ruined a golden opportunity for agreeing a clear and simple remedy,” said Ali Hood, Director of Conservation for the Shark Trust.

“The repeated obstruction of vital, science-based protections allows top mako fishing countries – Spain, Morocco, and Portugal — to continue to fish these endangered sharks, essentially without limit, and drive valuable populations toward collapse.”

 Shannon Arnold, Senior Marine Program Coordinator for Ecology Action Centre added: “Canada, Senegal, and the UK are today’s emerging shark champions. We urge all ICCAT Parties to follow their lead, before it's too late.”

Negotiations to protect the shark are ongoing and it is hoped the UK will be able to convince other world leaders to vote for their protection in the future.

The UK is considering further proposals to improve marine conservation once the Brexit transition period is over. One such policy is the protection of the bluefin tuna in our waters, which is endangered but currently fished by Spanish and French vessels.",,/r/europe/comments/jwy1ny/endangered_shark_at_risk_of_going_extinct_after/gct30aq/,commenian,1605769179

Looking at the import flows, the EU Member States imported a total of 4.8 bn litres of wine in 2019. Only 16% of this came from non-EU countries, notably from Chile (0.17 bn litres, 23% of extra-EU imports) and South Africa (0.16 bn litres, 21%).

Among the EU Member States, the largest importers of wine were Germany (0.23 bn litres, or 30% of the EU Member States' extra-EU imports), the Netherlands (0.11 bn litres, 15%), Denmark (0.07 bn litres, 9%), Sweden (0.06 bn litres, 8%), Belgium and France (both 0.05 bn litres, 7%) and Ireland (almost 0.05 bn litres, 6%).",Romania,/r/europe/comments/jwwy9h/wine_production_and_trade_in_the_eu_in_2019_the/gcswnas/,filosoful,1605763984

Had the Yugoslav Army advanced through Slavonia, the tanks would be in Zagreb in no more than 2 months, effectively ending the war. The city was encircled for about 3 months until its fall, yet there was no attempt to evacuate, the Croatian National Guard and HOS stayed fighting to death and bought time for Croatia to organize a defence. They were expected to last only a couple of weeks.

They managed to buy time, the front line in eastern Slavonia remained stagnant through the rest of the war, and Croatia was recognised by the international community about 2 months later. It's not some city where a big battle was fought, Vukovar and the people defending it were literally sacrificed in order for Croatia to have a chance at becoming a sovereign country.",,/r/europe/comments/jwrga5/why_is_spamming_polish_protest_articles_and/gcshs05/,Rotologoto,1605754662

5252,"&gt;Because a few less than perfect plane are literally infinitely better than no plane. If cheap equipment is all you can afford, then that is what you get. I'm sure not everything you own is of the highest possible quality. Everyone will try to get the best bang for their buck, but the bucks are not infinite and the bang includes a lot of things, some of which are not directly linked to the planes themselves.

I’m not saying everything should be at the highest quality. I’m talking about bang for the buck. A car worth $1 million is not 50 times more useful than a car worth $20,000. But a fighter jet worth $100 million is often way more than twice as useful than a fighter jet jet worth $50 million.  

&gt;That's not really how it works in real life though. Slightly lesser does not mean useless. And of course, most weapons bought are never used. Their primary function is to act as a deterrence, and some planes are better than no planes, just like even a flimsy door is better than no door at keeping people out. Then we have the fact that most wars these days are very asymmetrical, so you might not meet planes that are that great either.

It is how it works in real life. Take a look at any recent wars where combat aircraft actually fought each other: Iraq in 2003, the Gulf War in 1991, the 1982 Lebanon War. In each case the planes from the country with better equipment completely destroyed the planes from the country with worse equipment like completely lopsided kill ratios. “Slightly lesser” often turns into “a whole lot lesser”.



&gt;The F-35 is not an air superiority fighter, the F-22 is, and it is no longer produced. The F-35 is more like the next generation F-16, except the F-16 has been a stellar platform for most of it's operational life.

Thats not what I was getting at. I know that the Eurofighter is talked about as an “air superiority fighter” because that’s its designated role. But my point is that the Eurofighter is not nearly as good as the F-35 in actual one on one combat situations. Even if a Eurofighter might have a small edge in dogfighting, in real life that wouldn’t ever happen because the F-35 would be locked onto the Eurofighter well before the planes ever got into visual range to dogfight. 


&gt;The F-16 doesn't have canards because it's another (older) design. That doesn't mean that it would be a delta+canard design if it was designed later of course, just that it was not the common design when it was made, just like it is no longer the common design again. The F-16's engine might be a bit more powerful (too many versions used to keep track of), but that does not give the plane low speed maneuverability. At least not without trust vectoring, which the F-16 does not have. And I'm pretty sure all planes are g limited for the pilots' sake. It's not much larger than any Euro-canards either. It's slightly larger than Gripen and Rafale, but I don't think it's larger than the the Eurofighter. It's certainly not much larger, like the F-15 or F-22.

The point in time in which it was developed has nothing to do with it. The F-18 was introduced in 1983 and it doesn’t have canards. Why would a plane want low speed maneuverability?



&gt;It wasn't a sacrifice when they were made. That's why I'm saying that they're a product of their time. That said, with things like low frequency and asymmetric radars already well known countermeassures, the usefulness of today's stealth in a hot situation is very much questionable.


It was completely a sacrifice when they were made. The Eurofighter was only introduced in like 2003, by which time stealth technology was already being deeply developed by earlier planes like the F-22 or B-2, of F-117 Nighthawk.

Low frequency radar cannot get a missile lock on planes. Also, you realize that even if there was some new radar that was powerful enough to detect a stealth plane, that same radar would be detecting not stealth planes even further away. There is nothing questionable about it: the question here is about the usefulness of stealth compared to non-stealth. In any situation a plane with a lower radar cross section is always more useful than a plane with a larger cross section. To the extent that new radars might be able to lock onto well-designed stealth planes, those same new radars will be locking on eurocanards even further than the previous radar did. The relative advantage of the stealth vs non-stealth plane is still there. To the extent that new radars make stealth planes less useful, they make non-stealth planes completely useless.",,/r/europe/comments/jvzfno/us_spied_on_allies_including_netherlands_through/gcsi7j1/,JSanchez504,1605754895

Meanwhile Catalonia was founded by the Mega Euro-Chad Charlemagne, grandson of the Hyper Chad Charles the Hammer 🔨, and ruled by real OG Visigothic nobles, unlike Asturias which was ruled by deadbeat mountain shepherds whose idea of wealth was having two cows more than their neighbours.

5451,"&gt; So what would you call creating a law that a country didn't want in the EU, then using that law against them.

The rule of law. One can't always have it his way, compromising is not fascism. 

&gt; Sounds like fascism to me.

Then you should familiarize yourself with the definition of fascism.

&gt; THat's something Putin would do. 

I don't think Putin would force the rule of law on Poland, he doesn't have much regard for it in his own country let alone another.

&gt; They can leave poland and hungary out of the budget but poland and hungary can veto everything else.

Not everything. Not all subjects require unanimous voting. Only certain subjects are subject to 'veto's'. If they go down that path I suppose there will be solutions to pass them completely. 

&gt; No one wants that, so a compromise will be needed. 

The thing about a veto is that there isn't a compromise. Poland will veto the budget with a RoL clause, the rest will veto it without. 

So there's no compromise on the clause. It will have to be sought somewhere else.

&gt; The EU would not be able to function. No one wants that, so a compromise will be needed.

Not really, as it appears to be possible to exclude countries from the budget. That would be a possible compromise. Poland and Hungary can ignore the rule of law, but they will do so without our money.

&gt; Poland and Hungary have put their feet down already. THe EU can't pass a budget. The EU has a veto system and they are using it.

5576,"Believe me, FPÖ supporters would rather be found dead than being caught calling Austrians germans. I've met more than enough in my life already. The reason the FPÖ is such a big part of Austria's political landscape is because they're xenophobes. It has nothing to do with the management level's love for the germans. And the FPÖ knows that, that's why they don't openly ""admit"" to it, because they know if they did it'd be their complete downfall. There's few things that could destroy a party, not even rampant corruption (prime example: ibiza scandal) can, but calling Austrians germans would absolutely do the trick.

The exact same reason can be applied to why the ÖVP currently is the biggest party by far. Do you really think the average ""workers"" of this country enjoy having their rights taken away? You might think so because they're literally voting for the party that takes from the middle class and gives to the upper class. But the reason they're voting for something that hurts them is because they simply don't want foreigners in their country.

Let's see about that. I vote center-right and I think it stands the test.

&gt; Lisbon treaty directly states that EU has no right to meddle in member states judiciary system.

Not true. If the member state breaks the treaty they can sanction them.

&gt; EU budgets and spending was always directly assumed as system in which rules are clear and EU CAN'T just stop giving due to some subjective rules or opinions.

That's just bullshit. The European Parliament is the final arbiter. There are checks for a reason.

&gt;  So if you take away such funds they can as well just bail out from whole thing and in the end they will be in plus not EU.

Please do. Mark Rutte already suggested forming a new European Union without the two countries that are backsliding on rule of law and democratic values. It would be a relief.

&gt; That VETO power can stop whole union to stop completely if one member states wants it.

Exactly why the veto power should be lifted. Something Hungary and Poland have been resisting all this time.

&gt; So far none of EU commissars could point any argument against Poland or hungry which also does not occur in other member states.

So why be against it. Like the Polish opposition said, it's clearly because your government are shit negotiators.

&gt; Either way creation of EU in 2009 was big mistake. EU should remove Lisbon treaty and go back to ECC. Trade, movement and work. No societal change force because this is only recipe for disaster.

5636,"If it's the same case, then when North Macedonia will recognize that the Macedonian language was based on a western Bulgarian dialect, similar to Austrians who in fact directly recognize their language as German?

No one wants to label you as Bulgarians on official level. You can have your own identity, language, and country. No one will take that from you. The background of that identity is where the problems arise. Also the demands from the Bulgarian government are against your appropriation of the Bulgarian history, the anti-Bulgarian sentiments in Macedonia, and the lack of response and cooperation on other friendship treaty points like infrastructure.

Every second Bulgarian opened a talk about your identity, because ""the average Macedonian"" has questionable views on the historical origins of his identity. Austrians have concrete historical identity - Germans who created an independent kingdom in the Middle Ages. What is the Macedonian historical identity according to Macedonians? ""МАКЕДОНЦИ И НИШТО ПОВЕКЕ!!!"". From what I've seen the average Macedonian thinks that the ancient Macedonians assimilated the migrating Slavs into the ""ancient Macedonian identity"" and they were later conquered by the Bulgarians, but then the ""Macedonians rebelled and created the Samuil Macedonian Kingdom"" and that the Macedonian ethnicity can be traced back to the ancient Macedonians. The reality is that between the 10th and 19th century there are numerous evidences for the presence of the Bulgarian ethnic identity in Macedonia. The new Slavic Macedonian identity can be traced back to the middle of the 19th century.",,/r/europe/comments/jvvp2s/bulgaria_blocks_eu_accession_talks_with_north/gcqro9i/,ImamTorta,1605724001

5678,"Problem is the false security it gives. While in March/April when masks were not that widespread yet, people for example in supermarkets took more attention to distancing, this nowadays doesn't happen any more because they think ""well I'm wearing a mask now so I can go all huddly-cuddly oil sardine mode again"". Even some local health authorities have adopted that mindset. If you have been for example sitting next to someone in school 30cm away all day long (with bad ventilation and massive aerosol buildup) and that person gets tested positive, they will not even make you eligible for testing ""because you've been wearing a mask so nothing to worry about"". Result: Numbers don't really drop here plus death rates are going up, from which I conclude the current dark figure of actual daily infections is actually much higher once again, maybe 100-200k a day.

So while masks are definitely not useless and do give some risk reduction (how much is up to debate, personally I remember hearing in the radio about some University of Tokyo figure of a wimpy 17% for regular ones and 50% for FFP2) and therefore should be used, they shouldn't be seen as a free pass to ignore the rest of hygiene rules (especially distancing), but rather as a sort of ""bonus add-on""",Germany,/r/europe/comments/jwiw8g/danish_study_finds_face_masks_provide_limited/gcqso5j/,blubb444,1605724466

Your initial question was why Poles don't acknowledge Alexander as a King of Poland. Because although he might have ruled (*most of*) Poland, he wasn't a Polish King. He wasn't a Polish sovereign for Poles, he was a Russian Tsar who occupied and controlled Poland with no say from Polish authorities or the Polish people. There is an obvious distinction between the title Sobieski held and the title Alexander held. One is a legitimate sovereign King of a sovereign Polish state, the other is a title created by a foreign ruler occupying and controlling Polish territory. In this same vein most Poles don't claim that the Napoleonic Duchy of Warsaw as a legitimate, sovereign Polish state. Sure the Poles sided with Napoleon but as it was a client state of France with a Saxon King as Duke, it never held true sovereignty and therefore Poles don't truly identify with it.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/jwc7m8/detailed_map_of_europe_in_1765/gcqccv4/,Jaquestrap,1605716807

5756,"&gt; Don't get me started on tourists who say gracias instead of obrigado. They allways seem to be Americans for some reason.

Probably because many Americans learn Spanish and it's not unlikely many Portuguese understand some Spanish as well. My wife is fluent in Italian and so she tries to speak Italian in France and Spain when English fails because it's better than nothing. e.g. my Mexican friend can watch Italian TV, despite not knowing Italian.

Also, in my experience, it's common to get mixed up with automatic phrases like ""thanks"". Sometimes I say grazie in France or merci in Serbia. I've said hvala in Germany. When I was new in Germany, ""translate"" in my brain meant ""say it in French"", so I would often use French words, even if I knew the German ones. And when I go back home to Canada, sometimes I can't even think of the right English word (my native language) and can only think of the German one.

“Anti-maskers” is the equivalent to “anti-vaxxers” in that it serves to mock and shame anybody who even DARE to question what we are being told by authoritarian institutions. This reminds me of being younger in history class learning about how extreme Western monotheism was during the Medieval era And thinking about how stupid and primitive people were for shaming people who dare question the authority of God or The Church. 

As an American, I want to think that people in Europe are much smarter and more mature than us Americans, considering your countries have been around for thousands of years longer in total and that you would have woken up to the same ol’ propaganda machine by now. But since people in Europe are falling for this bullshit too that gives me zero hope about my country because if you people cannot see how blatantly obvious all the bullshit is by now, after thousands of years of history of nations rising and falling… There is zero chance Americans will even come close to figuring it out.

We are so deep into The Great Reset at this point pretty soon people are going to be shaming someone for simply asking what is the ingredients of a vaccine (oh wait we have already been doing that for the last 15 years).

5823,"&gt;In other words it’s not about national security, it’s about values. Okay, then stop using “western betrayal” as an excuse, it’s pathetic deflection.

Like I said, it's not an excuse. It's just something that Polish leaders have an absolute duty to learn from.

&gt;But then you don’t belong in the EU, and you shouldn’t act entitled to funding from member states.

First of all, I haven't lived in Poland since I was a kid and don't reside in Europe either. So I'm mostly an outsider looking at the situation with some insider perspective. 

And who's to say who belongs in the EU? Poland is staying based on agreed to rules, and not due to good graces. And whether or not they're entitled to funds or not, from realpolitik perspective, it would be irresponsible for Poland to not use the system for all its worth, and the system is such that this is entirely possible and thus being done.

&gt;If you wanna argue it’s just business and common sense to demand more money while shitting on your neighbors, fine. But then don’t act surprised when people start calling you a dick

Being called a dick doesn't matter.

5870,"&gt; A man has been arrested in connection with the deaths of 21 people in the 1974 pub bombings in Birmingham. The blasts at the Mulberry Bush and Tavern in the Town pubs on the night of 21 November also injured 220 people. 

&gt; Officers from Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands, working with the Police Service of Northern Ireland, arrested the 65-year-old at his home in Belfast. He was detained under the Terrorism Act and his home is being searched. The 65-year-old will be interviewed under caution at a police station in Northern Ireland, police said.
Saturday will mark the 46th anniversary of the bombings.

&gt; Fresh inquests last year ruled the victims were unlawfully killed, but did not establish who was responsible. Those hearings came after years of campaigning by families for a full account into what happened that night. Last month, Home Secretary Priti Patel announced she would be considering the case for a public inquiry into the bombings.

&gt; Six men - Hugh Callaghan, Paddy Hill, Gerard Hunter, Richard McIlkenny, William Power and John Walker - were wrongly jailed for life in 1975 for the bombings.

5872,"&gt; That is the proof of cultures staying dominant, 

So is being a ""dominant culture"" equivalent to being a ""superior culture""?

&gt; even after a millennium of empires dying, people come to see its architectural leftovers. 

Not really. If we look at the countries with the most annual tourists (pre-covid of course), like France and Spain, the vast majority of those tourists come from the EU. Most EU members are part of Schengen, thus they can basically move around the EU as if it was one country. Add to that that Europe is generally rather rich, thus much more people can actually afford to travel.

Thus it is more of the trend that people go to the next best country for holidays. Or if you actually think that people mainly go to countries to admire architecture they like, then it is simply ""Europeans/Westerners looking at European/Westerners  architecture"".

&gt; Why are Pyramids shown when they talk about Egypt? Weight of culture. And again ""aesthetics"" leads to people going to see the Pyramids. 

Sure, but it has also much to do with advertisement.

&gt; So yes, tourists do measure the superiority of a culture. Cause if humans don't go and view a thing by their own eyes, it doesn't have any importance.

So you think most tourists are people who travel to look at architecture and not people who simply want to relax a little?

You seem to be stuck in cyclical thinking.

Tourism relies mostly on a few factors. Spending ability of the tourist, proximity to the tourist, infrastructure and stability of the host country.

5876,"&gt; I always thought that the Germanic tribes split themselves off before a Frankish empire started to rise 

It's the other way around, after the collapse (more accurately called 'falling apart over the course of several years') of the Roman Empire Frankish 'tribes' from what we now call Germany conquered the land we now call France.  
Franks are 'germans', in a horrid totally not applicable to our current nation-state-identities way.

So Denmark could intercept cables in Denmark? And in exchange, Americans get cables to Eastern Europe? And then they suddenly spy on the Western Europe? So many questions.

There are dozens of national NGOs that deal with trafficking, especially sex trafficking / forced prostitution.

5963,"Just replied to the previous guy.There are fragments about human rights and democracy, they were not initially central. As you stated - treaties evolved over time.

What I consider central reasons are the ones the treatymakers give on the top of the document in the first articles that describe their goals. Democracy is far below the top in [1993 Maastrich treaty](https://europa.eu/european-union/sites/europaeu/files/docs/body/treaty_on_european_union_en.pdf) (founding EU document - fragment "" The Union shall set itself the following objectives ""). Before that there is only list of intentions (that has word ""law"" in it) and list of signatories.

That does not mean it may not change over time (i.e common currency used to be critical and this is what member states accepted, discussion about it was quietly frozen over 2010's - no longer that central, despite most countries commiting to moving to EUR eventually in joining treaties ).

Today we can see minorities in the goals (article 2 TEU) or male/female equal rights - good example of what else was added, despite being less central (a part of human rights law).",,/r/europe/comments/jwc6q3/the_eu_can_resist_orbán_and_kaczynskis_budget/gcpni8v/,PigTenis,1605702288
