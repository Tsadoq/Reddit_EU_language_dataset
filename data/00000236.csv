31,"Right, here we go again.

We had another one of these bullshit stories just recently:
https://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Belgium-companies-sold-deadly-chemicals-to-Assad-in-violation-of-sanctions-551224

Turns out those ""deadly chemicals"" were... isopropanol (aka [isopropyl alcohol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isopropyl_alcohol)) - fucking rubbing alcohol!

The one specific bit of *this* article mentions the name of a German company, Krempel GmbH, that sold ""industrial material"" to an Iranian businessman. They're more specific in two [other](https://www.jpost.com/International/Germany-sold-technology-to-Iran-for-use-in-Syrian-chemical-attacks-540760) [articles](https://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/German-company-involved-in-Syrian-chemical-attacks-defies-US-warnings-549486), the ""electronic technology [sic!]"" that Krempel sold to Iran is... cellulose-based electrical insulation. 

(specifically, [Krempel Pressspan PSP-3040](https://schupp.ch/de/katalog_de_pdf/ISFL_02_Einschichtige_Isolierstoffe.pdf)(page B3))

The less specific parts of the article mention German ""software"", ""vacuum and control-engineering technologies"", ""measurement devices"" and ""electrical equipment"", all the details and the insidious roles that those products might serve in the Iranian rocket or nuclear program are left to the reader's imagination.

I for one don't imagine rubbing alcohol when I hear of a ""deadly chemical"" and until I see some specifics on these allegations (and a better source than this bullshit-peddling rag), I'll assume that the goods in question this time are about as dangerous (or specific to military use) as isopropanol and cellulose.

37,"Interesting survey, but I think there are serious problems with your methodology. By explicitly naming five regions to choose from, you prejudice respondents towards answering in a particular way. Moreover, by only allowing single responses, you really distort the results by forcing respondents to treat the regions as mutually exclusive categories. I suspect that many people would conceive of the regions as overlapping. In the minds of many (at least in Western Europe), the terms Eastern Europe and Western Europe are defined by the Cold War's geopolitical division, whereas concepts like Central Europe, Southern Europe and Northern Europe are defined more by other features such as language, geographical location and pre-WW2 history. For this reason, for example, I'd see Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia as both Eastern and Central Europe. 

Furthermore, you force respondents to place whole countries within the regions, not allowing them to acknowledge countries as straddling divides. There are several countries that I'd be inclined to consider divided between two regions. Most obviously, I see Turkey and Russia as divided between Europe and Asia (with the relevant divisions at the Bosphorus and the Urals respectively), but I also feel that the south of France is part of Southern Europe, while the centre and north aren't.",,/r/europe/comments/8nl6ur/the_regions_of_europe_results_of_a_survey/e0130w4/,Comparable_Animal,1528005276

122,"SS Divisions weren't really 'worse than the Wehrmacht' on account of them being SS divisions.

You had divisions like the SS 9th Hohenstaufen Division who were responsible for zero war crimes, while a Heer division like the 1st Gebirgs Division were responsible for many civilian massacres, Jew roundups, and they were part of the absolutely horrible massacre of the Acqui Division in Greece.

Not to mention the Heer starved 3 million Soviet POW's to death in their camps. And the number of Germans in *Wehrmacht* anti-partisan divisions was much larger than the number of Germans in Waffen-SS anti-partisan divisions.

So no, the things the SS divisions was largely acceptable, barring something like the SS Dirlewanger, as far as the standard among the entire German armed services goes.

I am not trying to defend the SS by saying this either. I am merley pointing out, that you are helping perpetuate the Clean Wehrmacht myth that Manstein tried so hard to forge. The average SS man and the average Heer man were either just as evil, or not at all. There is no other standard, honestly. Anything else whitewashes history.

137,"The key to understanding Trump is to listen to Trump himself as opposed to people voicing opinions about Trump.

Just as a recent example look at the Iran Agreement.  For several years now Trump has been very bluntly saying that he thinks it is a bad deal and that he would either renegotiate or walk away from it.  In 1987, he put out a book called The Art of the Deal in which he lays out his basic negotiating style.  

Obama never got the agreement approved by congress in fact they voted it down by almost 2 to 1.  Any EU or Iranian leader that knows enough about international agreements to know that if they have not gone thru the approval process then they are not approved.  Obama, who used to be a constitutional law professor at a law school certianly understood this.  

Trump did bring up a number of legitimate concerns with the agreement and people like Macron and Merkel agreed that he he had legitimate concerns and were willing to negotiate.  The Iranians are the ones that refused to negotiate despite many offers to negotiate from Trump.  They knew full well that it had never been approved and that Trump had been  openly telling then for years that it would either be renegotiated or he would leave it.

The media and other world leaders spun things differently and people acted shocked when he pulled out but anyone that actually listened to Trump instead of just people voicing opinions about Trump knew years ago what he would do.

Trump is easy to understand if you actually listen to him.  If you can not bring yourself to listen to a long term ally who is the leader of a world super power then at some point that is on you not him.

For this reason even pure water looks blue. But these particles not only scatter, but also absorb higher frequencies more strongly.

241,"&gt; Am I correct in assuming that you are trying to put the death toll for the whole war as the responsibility of Nazi Germany? The high end estimation of 80m is to include those who died of disease or famine.

You are correct. If someone died due to something either directly or indirectly caused by the war, then it gets added to the tally.

&gt; You are making assumption that ""worse"" equates to being a higher number in the death toll.

Me and every sane person, sure.

&gt; And that is what happened to up to 3 million Indians in the Bengal Famine as a result of the British governments decision to ""supply the army's needs and let the Indian people starve if necessary"".

Which wouldn't have happened had we not been fighting a war with the Nazis at the time.

&gt; Its not the first time the British happen to have been in power at the time of a devastating famine that just happens to occur around a time period of strengthening resolve for independence by the natives within occupied territories.

Ignoring the fact that India became independent 2 years after the war, but OK.

&gt; All we ever hear from British people is what a fantastic and wonderous history their country has

I haven't seen anybody say that. We may argue that we have a better history than some, but this is just a strawman. You're just making shit up.

&gt; I'm not picking on the British in particular though, you can say the same about many of the nations in Europe.

This might have had some weight had you not focused *exclusively* on Britain in your entire post.

&gt; My point in all this is if you are going to morally bash Germans for their Nazi past, then you are a hypocrite if you don't morally bash your own or other Europeans violent and death filled pasts.

Why... why do you assume that people who criticise the Nazis don't also criticise themselves? You're just making up what you think people do and then get mindlessly annoyed about it from behind your computer screen.

My reality is that the US has been inhospitable and overreaching with business and regulation, which is why commerce has outsourced to China, Mexico, non-western Europe, and India.

High taxes and high spending are unsustainable, which is why there’s a diaspora of wealth into tax havens and less developed nations. 

Also, the original comment pointed out that the EU has double the tariffs of the US. Social programs and using that tax money while calling out Trump for behaving the same way is hypocritical.

Note: It is purely my own subjective evaluation of the parties' past activity, their recent campaign and where applicable their answers to an 8-values questionnaire. The values are the same as recently posted on r/slovenia; sadly the entire thread didn't get much attention, but neither did anyone think I'm way off, so ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

Unlike the Political Compass, the y-axis covers the conservative–progressive aspect. For most purposes it can be seen as pretty much identical to the authoritarian-liberal labels. I simply find these hold too strong a value judgment, which makes them somewhat unhelpful for broad usage.

You may have noticed Slovenes typically place liberals somewhere 'left of centre'.

317,"&gt;Oh tell me please how SS divisions are not genocidal and unjust.....

In 1946, the Nuremberg Tribunal declared the Waffen-SS to be a criminal organization, making an exception of people who had been forcibly conscripted. Throughout the post-war years, the Allies would apply this exception to the soldiers of the Latvian Legion and the Estonian Legion. The US Displaced Persons Commission in September 1950 declared that:

**""The Baltic Waffen SS Units (Baltic Legions) are to be considered as separate and distinct in purpose, ideology, activities, and qualifications for membership from the German SS, and therefore the Commission holds them not to be a movement hostile to the Government of the United States.""[14]**

Even before this decision, around 1,000 former Latvian Legion soldiers had served as guards at the Nuremberg trials, guarding Nazi war criminals. Afterwards, during the Berlin Blockade, they took part in securing Allied facilities involved in the Berlin Airlift and later also were guarding USA Army headquarters.

326,"You can demand anything.  I can demand that Mongolia recognize me as the Second Coming of Jesus.  Demands are available to anyone.

There are three parties here:

* Brussels wants to have a functioning customs union.

* Dublin wants no borders to facilitate it ultimately acquiring some British territory.

* London wants economic control of its full country.

These three are incompatible with each other: at most two can exist.

Brussels and London both are fully capable of producing the situations they want, and nobody has a way to force them not to get what they want.  I expect that they will get what they want.  Dublin has no ability to force what it wants.  I would be very surprised if it gets it.

Dublin has said ""I want no customs border"".  The UK has said ""I'm fine with that and will happily conform, but I cannot make Brussels also conform"".  The UK knows perfectly well that simply not forcing a border will screw up the customs union.  Brussels would rather have a functioning customs union than Ireland as a member, so it'll tell Ireland ""enforce customs at the border or leave the EU"".  Ireland would prefer to be a member of the EU than to not have a customs border, so it will yield.

Dublin's only leverage is the ability to veto a deal.  This would (a) annoy the EU-26 and (b) the UK is clearly not relying on the existence of any deal at Brexit Day.

Result: there will be a border.  It will probably be as weakly-enforced as Ireland can get away with — trying to *force* the UK and Ireland to have a hard border when neither really has strong interests in doing so, given the limits of current EU authority, is going to be difficult.

I'd also add that I suspect that EEA status was designed to intentionally be less desirable than EU membership, so as not to compete with it.

378,"Yeah, unfortunately you're vastly underestimating how far our freedom goes. Sure, in most cases a religious rules won't allow you to break normal laws (there are a few exceptions in some countries which I actually disagree with), but that does in no way prevent people from setting up their own set of rules. It just limits on how they can enforce them. So for example it's not legal to say that ""if you don't wear a veil I'll kill you"". But it's perfectly legal to say ""if you don't wear a veil neither me nor anyone in our family will ever speak to you again"". Almost all pressure cults (and Salafism is a classic cult) exert is psychological. It depends on making youb elieve that they need you and that there's no alternative for you. It's called brainwashing. And brainwashing on its own is perfectly legal. 

I understand your viewpoint. I wouldn't have a second thought about going over dead bodies if that was necessary to prevent someone from forcing me into a life I don't want. You're probably thinking similarly. But that is because we grew up in a free society among people who wanted us to have choices and because (I assume) neither of us can imagine that everyone we know would turn to hate us just for wearing the wrong type of clothing or for loving the wrong person. But if you were socialized a certain way would be different. And the persons who flee cults are always the ones who still have *some* contacts to the outside. The people who actually seek help from NGOs and the authorities and about whom you can regularly read are always the ones who knew another way of life because schools and outside friends showed them that it exists. The people truly embedded in a cult are simply not mentally capable of making the decision to leave. 



You're also vastly overestimating how much our police etc. can actually do. Good luck finding out about a person who's locked up by a cult. I mean, no one has seen Shelly Miscavige the wife of Scientology leader David Miscavige in a decade. But the authorities don't actually appear to be digging into that. And this is a case where the public actually knows and cares. Good luck for someone who never was noticed by anyone. 


Western freedoms are great, but they also give you the choice to give up these freedoms. Those freedoms also limits how much force we can use when we want to help people. Symbolic gestures like banning burqas are already the very limit of how far our legal systems allow us to go. 

We can't legally push people out of their mental prisons. Hence we have to pull them out. And that only works when these people have a way to learn about why our way of life is better.

383,"I feel like other people have already answered most of your questions quite well so I'll go more into detail about Alenka Bratušek. There's two big reasons many people dislike her and why she suddenly lost so much support. 

 During her tenure the government had to bail out one of biggest banks in Slovenia based on projections that were later found to be highly overestimated so the amount of taxpayer money that ended up being spent to save the bank turned out to be much higher than necessary. 

The second issue is the fact that after her resignation due to her party's vote to reinstate Janković as their president   but before the new Cerar government took over she conveniently became the candidate for European Comissioner of Energy under the then new Juncker Comission. Not only did that look really bad and shady she also bungled her confirmation hearing so badly that MEPs rejected her in a 112-13 vote. 

Since then everyone has presumed her political career dead by this election cycle and yet somehow after years of polling at 1% in every monthly poll she's somehow clawed her way back near to that 4% entry line in the last few weeks so she could be back in parliament or even part of a governing coalition yet.

I could not. Religious exemption laws are in themselves begging to just be abused by the next religion that comes along.

Did you actually go and watch a religious animal slaughter?

I will defend everybody's right to be a muslim or a jew or even a scientologist but we all live in the same society and thus it has to be governed by secular laws which do not tolerate religions to violate the fundamental rights of anyone.

The next religion has a day where they throw all their trash out the window instead of in a trash can and then what do you do? The next religion will have animal sacrifice in it and then what do you do? The next religion chops off the left pinkie finger of girls at birth and then what do you do? *No.* No exemptions from rules and regulations for religions.

&gt; Your lame ass can google ""cortisol and chronic stress"" for more scientific articles.

You really have some misconception going on about what citing articles is for. It's not some silly formality, it's intended to show that your position is backed up by actual research. To make sure that is the case, the least you should do is read what you link yourself. If you did, you would have noticed that this link supports what I've been saying.

From the abstract:

&gt;Cortisol also may facilitate the consolidation of fear-based memories for future survival and avoidance of danger. Although short-term stress may be adaptive, maladaptive responses (eg, magnification, rumination, helplessness) to pain or non–pain-related stressors may intensify cortisol secretion and condition a sensitized physiologic stress response that is readily recruited. Ultimately, a prolonged or exaggerated stress response may perpetuate cortisol dysfunction, [...]Exaggerated psychological responses (eg, catastrophizing) following maladaptive cognitive appraisals of potential stressors as threatening may exacerbate cortisol secretion and facilitate the consolidation of fear-based memories of pain or non–pain-related stressors; however, coping, cognitive reappraisal, or confrontation of stressors may minimize cortisol secretion and prevent chronic, recurrent pain. 

Clearly newborns *are* helpless and *are not* capable of dealing cognitively with stressors, for example circumcision. Lacking this coping mechanism, they are particularly vulnerable to permanent psychological dysfunction.

&gt;wanker....Your lame ass ...Now go back to your safe space and cry about circumcision.... you need me to shove the link up your ass because you're too ignorant to do it yourself.

As you see, these sort of arguments make little sense. The way Christianity developed, in all its different forms in Europe, *define* European culture. There are more Catholic (and I would think protestant, but don't quote me on this) adherents outside of Europe than in Europe - that doesn't make Catholicism and Protestantism not be part of European culture.

The oldest [Christian Cathedral in the world is in Armenia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etchmiadzin_Cathedral) and Armenia is littered with ancient churches and monasteries everywhere you look, and as such the specific development of the Armenian Apostolic Church along with the accompanying cultural contributions is very much what defines Armenia and Armenians independently of where the religion originates from or how many adherents of a similar ""type"" (edit: check comment below) of Christianity exist elsewhere.

They had no choice since they were literally fighting to save their lives and the lives of their families.

jesus christ man just look at a map of the ottoman empire, lack of access to the oceans? direct access to the indian ocean how much more access do you want? why do you think the vast majority of colonial trade passed through ottoman waters later on? how can the British and French find such good use for the red sea but the ottomans not? oh but no there was no way for the ottomans to participate in global trade because the ""powers that be had decided that they could not and therefore it was their fault and no failure on our part""

\&gt; Norway isn't really a place you can rule with an army and a central \(a la France\) administration. I'd imagine a navy was involved in some way. Even more important likely was the good economic prospects of the age,

so basically you don't know but you are going to just assume to have a better understanding than the guy who is literally from the region. Maybe this lack of cultural self criticism is part of the reason for bad historical decision making, hm?

\&gt; Swedish culture didn't invent the blast furnace or the railway to transport ore. But it did import these inventions when they made obvious sense.

ignoring the implication that invention has to come from within a culture and the fundamentally flawed concept of culture that that entails, the point is as you say, Sweden DID import innovation when it made obvious sense, the ottomans DID NOT. why? because of weather? geography?

I cba responding to everything because honestly I care about modern Greece not the ottomans. But from the beginning every argument you make starts \*after\* the effects of culture e.g. ""internal rebellion"" ""hostile foreign relations"" ""not in a position to do this or that"".

\&gt;  Do you believe that Korean culture simply is better at this than Swedish culture?

yes, demonstrably they are. Why did you think this was going to be an effective argument? There is a lot to learn from Korean and other cultures. Maybe the fundamental attitude of yours that led you to believe I wouldn't agree with this statement, namely that you don't consider that other cultures might have something to learn from, is the foundation of the problems of the south?",Sweden,/r/europe/comments/8nxr94/employment_rate_2017_age_2064/dzzpyjs/,GargleMayonnaise_,1527945730

920,"&gt; if Iceland isn't resource poor, then neither is Greece. And the concept of resource-rich has lost all meaning. Literally you cannot find a better real world manifestation of a cold lifeless rock in the middle of a stormy ocean than Iceland.

Formerly whaling, now fishing. Aluminum and more importantly: lots and lots of very cheap electricity. Iceland is anything but lifeless, economically speaking. It is teeming with energy and is home to some of the largest aluminum production plants on earth.

Mind you they also imploded financially, it's just that their real industry was not harmed by this.

&gt; oh yes population size is an obstacle to economic performance, that's why historically nations have sought to reduce their population size. /s

If your resources and land are limited like being on an island, yes. Bangladesh for example while not an island, will find it very hard to extract value from its population in the future compared to a country like Canada. You can't make Kazakhstan productive by adding half a billion people to it, it just doesn't work that way.

&gt; oh please, do you not see the very thing I pointed out in action here? every Germanic country has some kind of natural advantage over every other country to explain their economy. at some point you have to recognize that Greece isn't a barren wasteland. Maybe this is the reason for their economy? people just don't think there's potential for growth and therefore they don't grow.

Greece has had a fairly good track record when it comes to GDP growth. It just has never done so in a stable manner. True, that costs them but not as much as you're implying. Greece never was going to become a Norway in the period between WW2 and now unless it was managed by aliens.

Greece indeed isn't a barren wasteland and they have a substantial real economy but their problems aren't just political stubbornness. They can grow just fine. Between 1980(picked arbitrarily) and 1999(€ adoption) they grew by the same proportion. About 150%. The difference is that Norway had a big head start so had a higher GDP/capita figure while Greece was trying to capture Crete and Thessaloniki etc. In 1960 it had triple Greece's GDP/capita. It's the same (I'm fudging the 2008 crisis as Greece isn't recovering properly yet) ratio now. Greece doesn't have an edge that would make it catch up. At least not it today's world.

&gt; I suppose Sweden having infrastructure is a byproduct of some weird feature of Sweden's economy and/or geography and/or resource richness that encourages us to build infrastructure that just so happens to be beneficial to Norway?

I wouldn't know. The fact that it's beneficial and that you haven't been each others throats' in earnest for a couple hundred years and have maintained a mutually beneficial, productive existence for most of it helps however.

&gt; how much do you know about Norway's history? are you aware that it has been a subject country to Denmark/Sweden for hundreds of years? do you know that Norway became independent in 1905?

That period (prior to independence) had amazing conditions for Norway's economy to flourish. Hell, even being part of the Danish market helped immensely.

&gt; I mean just look at the map posted in this thread, no single region of Germany has an employment rate the same light shade of green as italy, every single one is higher employment than the favorable Italian Po valley.

The statistic you're choosing to look at is not inherently good or bad. Different societies choose different social systems. Germany's export focused, low unemployment, highly industrial economy and related policies are not necessarily better. The health of an economy and society is not judged by what proportion of people are formally working. Italians may opt for more leisure time or raising kids, which is simply different, not better or worse. _Unemployment_ or _underemployment_ however, indicates that something is seriously wrong.

&gt; Are you telling me the whole of germany is made up of a giant Po valley?

Essentially, yes. Though this isn't relevant to the map in OP.

&gt; perform quite well? they are more yellow than green they're between romania and cyprus for overall employment

Once again, societal choices. German and French productivity levels have always been very close and historically they've been neck and neck on everything ranging from warfare to technological invention to education to economic output.

924,"&gt; Why on earth would they blow their facade by voting to ""save"" PP when PSOE had a guaranteed win in the vote of no confidence and PP couldn't be saved?

You realise this is the question I'm myself posing? Explanations can be a myriad of them, not the least of which being that virtue signaling is an extremely important aspect of vertically-organised power structures. Plus, the ""guaranteed win"" wasn't **At fucking all** clear until about 11pm of the day of the debate in congress. Don't act like it was such a ""known thing"". 

Especially because, **even if we're to assume there was a guaranteed win on it**, that very much doesn't explain why they'd make the effort to ""protest"" against Sanchez by voting against the Moción the Censura. Other parties protested as well, they just kept in line with their stated ideologies that priority number 1 was to rid the government of a party that's officially deemed systemically corrupted. It's weird that this wasn't C's priority yesterday.

&gt; Could it be that they don't want to support PSOE's bid for government with nationalists and independents as they have said?

Which is against, again, their stated ideals of pluralism, pacting, and a cooperating government. When I said ""they revealed themselves"" I meant it in all senses of the word: During Rivera's speech on the matter, which was a diametrical departure from his rhetoric the last few months, he shat on a plurastic government by literally using the words ""nationalist and independents"" as a dirty word. In that moment I found myself thinking ""wow, this person is trying to shit-talk the parties elected in seats which represent more than a vast majority of the population. This isn't the defender of democracy and the Rule of Law that he pretended to be the last few months"".  

But of course, he's free to hate on nationalist parties. Many people do. It's just that when it came the time to weight in on the single biggest political issue in Spain at the moment (I mean, not anymore), the fact that Rajoy is in power after the Gurtel sentencing (something Rivera himself endorsed for the last few weeks), suddenly he didn't act as he said he would.

His excuses are weak and unconvincing. They amounted to a Perfect Solution Fallacy, and if we're to take Rivera at his word that this is what actually happened, then we must simply conclude that he's stupid enough to fall for such reasoning, absolutely.

&gt; Could it be that they wanted to pact with PSOE fresh democratic elections, as they tried. But PSOE would rather get the power while they could instead of letting the people vote?

Just one **tiny** inconsistency with this ""reasoning"": 

Trying to reach that pact with PSOE was a separate issue than the one they actually voted on (the Moción de Censura). Not being able to reach a pact of immediate elections **does not explain at all why they didn't at the very fucking least ABSTAIN in a vote whose only purpose was to depose the head of a party who was denying that there was an issue with not only widespread but also systemic and deep corruption all throughout it**. Nope, apparently we're to believe that the most outspoken person against the corruption in the party that Rajoy leads, **voted for keeping him in power when he refused to renounce**, because reasons. Because, despite claiming to be a centrist party, they didn't agree with the president of the moderate left party becoming the temporary president of government. 

Yeah, that makes all the sense in the world! Because, of course, Rivera couldn't possibly have done like the parties that he claims are irredeemable reactionaries and extremists, and actually pact to give this important vote to achieve the most important objective (to get rid of Rajoy), with explicit protests against Sánchez (who as far as we and Rivera knows, is the president of a party not convicted nor riddled with crazy systemic corruption) being president or the current unapproved general budget plan. Or, as I said, abstain. 

&gt;  they voted NO because they are liars, but retarded liars and made the mistake of showing their true face for nothing.

I didn't say they're retarded, only that they showed their hand. I don't know their actual motivations. I only know what they did. 

This wasn't the action that showed the populace that C's is the ""Millenial PP""; it's just a crucial symbol that corroborated it. We all knew it, even the people that abandoned PP for them in the last few months.

926,"The climate impact of the gulf stream turns out to be far smaller than people tend to think. The climate on the western part of the continent is tempered by the movement of **air**, not water. There is a prevailing western wind at the latitudes range of most of Europe. The Rocky Mountains mountain range all the way in western North America causes a bend in the jetstream, which gives Eastern North America a prevailing north western wind, straight from the continent, meaning a relatively cool continental climate. The bend in the jetstream turns back north over the Atlantic, which gives Europe prevailing south western winds, meaning a relatively warm maritime climate. You'll find that the west coast of the US and Canada have climates very similar to the ones in Western Europe at the same latitude, despite having an ocean current moving from north to south there.

951,"**Warning wall of text incoming:**, I ended up just using this an excuse to read up on the exact current state of censorship in the west. I am not even expecting you to waste your time reading this sillyness. I wasn't expecting it to balloon to this size, but I just sort of kept typing as I read something new.

So that article was from 2013, and no new laws have been passed half a decade later now. It would seem the idea lived long enough for a few articles to be published and then be forgotten.

There are as far as I can tell, only a small handful of vaguely western nations which do criminalize consenting adult pornography.

**United Kingdom**: ""hardcore pornography"" is highly regulated and there about a 1,000 cases a year of people being tried for possessing certain kinds of hardcore pornography hardcore pornography which depict or simulate extreme violence or abuse. even if they are acting or role playing between fully consenting adults. Most recently, a right wing conservative lead government enacted the mandatory porn filter and regulation, and made possession of simulated rape porn illegal.

**Australia**: Perhaps one of the most right wing western nations, also has the most restrictive censorship laws in the western world by an absurd margin. Porn is illegal to sell or produce to anyone in most territories, all media must reviewed by the government for sale and distribution and if refused, is illegal to own or distribute. almost all depictions of any fetishes are illegal to depict in porn or otherwise.

And if we leave the realm of not strictly western allies, but not exactly Eastern...

**Russia**: Russia, remarkably conserative and right wing nation, has routinely banned large porn websites for years at a time. Also there whole ""Gays are not real, never depict them in media"" laws.

**Ukraine**: Fairly conserative, and Porn is technically illegal since 2009 but not enforced.

**Iceland**: Very, very left wing, Video and broadcast pornography was technically outlawed in the 1980s, but the laws have never been enforced and porn is purchasable similarly to the U.S even in public businesses as long as not freely on display for children.   A few ex MPs talked about banning online porn for a week in 2013.

I have seen left wing protests aimed at private businesses succeed in having a private business change how it does business, and I am certainty aware of far-left groups that view pornography as harmful or have anti-sex attitudes.

But in the real, actual modern world, the only group which has any actual record of extensive censorship and destruction of individual freedoms when in power is the right. The feminism boogeyman, the ""offended SJW"" are all batting .000 on actual human right violations while the right wing actively shits on real freedom of speech across the western world to this very day.

Far-right acts out of fear for themselves. From immigrants, from 'deviants', from different religions. The far-left isn't acting out fear for its self, but for others. A far right extremist is driven to action out of misplaced self-preservation and desperation. A far-left extremist wants to ensure protections for people who aren't them even at their own potential expense. Even if their position is just as misguided and irrational, its an inherently more complicated one and less emotionally reactionary. Its so much easier to deal with ""The proliferation of porn can cause societal changes that in turn can increase rates of violence against woman"" than, ""IMMIGRANTS COMING TO STEAL MY JOB! THE GAYS CAUSE HURRICANES!""

Angry, fanatical left wingers hop on Tumblr and say stupid poorly thought out shit and get angry at stores for dumb reasons because they think they need to defend others. 

Angry, angsty right wingers kill people, bomb medical clinics, scream about building thousand mile walls, shoot random people who look brown because they might be from the wrong country, burn down churches of the ""wrong religion"", and outlaw freedoms, all because they think they themselves are in danger. Hell, even the resurgence of a group like Anti-Fa which is basically masked far-left mobs have at worst caused bruise and cuts. Meanwhile, dozens of Mosques are burned to the ground every year in the U.S by politically motivated right wing terrorism, for example. 

TL:DR If you are actually worried about real freedom of speech and protecting, you don't have to vote left wing though its probably the second safest bet behind your local super Laissez-faireorganization, but sure as fuck don't ever vote right wing / conservative.

But its jarring for the other party and they will feel uncomfortable and likely not strike up a conversation meaning much less contact with any non muslim. But this is what many muslims want.

Ever seen women in burqas with sunglasses? Even without them, in a face to face human interaction, it inhibits communication massively. One party is essentially hiding, it’s a werid dynamic and always will be.

You cant integrate into western culture with a burqa. It’s literally impossible, and they should really question why they are even in a western country if they either dispise its culture or dont want to integrate.

Plus is completely hides their identity in all public situations, this is a major reason why it’s an issue.

&gt;And you’re fools not to try the same yourselves.

Who says, we don't. But there are more subtle tools than 19th century tarriffs on security grounds. The glorious steel jobs won't come back even with protectionism. Automatization has taken the jobs. Germany produces about the same amounts of steel as in the 70'ies, but with a fraction of employees.

&gt;So long as the Gulf states take dollars for oil...

My train of thought goes the other way around: If the USA closes its market, the world simply won't have dollars to use. To serve as reserve currency and as a general mean of trade, the dollars have to be spread around the world. You cannot have both, a closed economy **and** a generally accepted and used world currency. 

&gt;no better time to take the mercantilist approach needed to capture more production and wealth for ourselves.

Capture. Mhm. By making all your products, which use steel and aluminium, more expensive. That's a great masterplan.

&gt;East-west is just one fault line in the EU.

&gt; You may apply for a residence permit for a specialist

&gt; Whether you are a specialist depends on the educational background that your work requires and the compensation paid for it.
&gt; 
&gt; You may be considered to be a specialist if:
&gt; 
* Your work is demanding and requires a higher education degree.
&gt; 
* Your salary is higher than average (at least EUR 3,000 gross pay per month).

&gt; In your application, you must prove that you meet these criteria. We use these criteria to evaluate whether you can be considered a specialist. If you do not meet these criteria for a residence permit for a specialist but still wish to apply for one, your application must clearly explain why your work is an expert task that requires expertise. For example, that the task requires expertise that you possess but that cannot be acquired by higher education and that the salary you receive corresponds with such expertise. If you show that the task is an expert task that requires expertise even though you do not fully meet the above mentioned criteria, you may be granted a residence permit for specialists as an exception.
&gt; 
&gt; Specialists for example include:
&gt; 
&gt; IT experts

&gt; experts in some field of specialisation who have a higher education degree
&gt; other persons with a higher education degree whose work requires expert knowledge

If not then price stays  same but waiting time is about 4 months and application has to go thru ""do we need workers on that area for that kind of work""

Is that the standard for governance? The highest government in the land will stoop down to a lower level to cheat? The EU is in dire need of reform if that is the case, even the US, which is in an extremely dire situation today, is not that low.

&gt;From the very start, the UK has always had a quite difficult relation with the EU. But that doesn't matter on the substance. The Brits never failed to live up to the rules they agreed on when they joined. They never gutted the judiciary. They never gagged the press. They never nixed basic parliamentary institutions. And they never let down anyone when called upon, even if they didn't particularly like it.

They never did any of that because they had the hard power to sabotage in other ways.  That same power is not available to all members of the EU.

&gt;Because they are a sovereign nation and know that it doesn't diminish sovereignty when you play by the rules you've agreed to.

Maybe all NATO members will hit 2% military spending then, then they can be considered sovereign by your standards.

With respect to killing civilians, Israel is the absolute undisputed champion, and Hamas or anybody else doesn't even come close. The statistics are there for everyone to see. Just today a Palestinian nurse was murdered by a Israeli sniper. 

Like I said earlier, Israel is the occupying power, under international law Palestinians have the full rights to defend themselves and request an end to the illegal inhuman blockade of Gaza.

Always remember that a rapist does not have the right to defend himself against the women her is raping. As the occupying power, Israel is the rapist. 

You are clearly brainwashed and extremely racist against the Palestinian people. You've failed into the trap of believing that they are all a bunch of Islamist savages, and you don't seem to understand that they are just normal human beings who want to be left alone to live their life in freedom on their land. No blockade, no checkpoints, no Jewish soldiers controlling them. 

And not it's not about a parking ticket it's about being human and understanding that this zionist barbarity cannot continue and that sooner or later a price is always paid. 

If you are truly not a Jew, then you are a bigger tool than you can imagine for being a supporter of inhumanity and barbarity. have you see videos of Israeli solider breaking the arms of Palestinian children? Have you see Jewish trucks spraying sewer water on entire Palestinian neighbourhoods? have you see Jewish soldier sniping unsuspecting children and high living each other like it was a game? Have you see footage of Israeli solider shooting a civilian in the leg and leaving him on the group bleeding with his leg completely torn off and requiring amputation simply because he waked outside during curfew? It's because of the countless brainwashed tools like you zionist state terrorism continues to operate in total impunity. Your epic stupidity makes you an unwitting accomplice of evil. there is so much about Israel that you don't know. Like for example the fact that Israeli weapons are routinely tested on Palestinian civilians and later sold around the world.

Here's the thing. in 1492, Columbus sailed the ocean blue, he was sent by Spain trying to find a shorter route to India, presumably by proving it was round. He ran into some Carribeans and was absolutely convinced he'd landed in India until the day he died. Then Cortez showed up, he was also Spanish. Francisco Pizarro never did anything of interest, but you can't get an A unless you remember his name. Then Amerigo Vespucci named it after himself because he's a cocky shit. This paragraph is now equal in size to *all* the reading American students will do about the discovery of the New World (with their misconceptions included). 

We'll then proceed to jump ahead 200 years, with a quick gloss over the columbian exchange (which, as we know, existed only insofar as it brought disease, horses and slaves) and the triangle trade (slaves, slaves, and slaves). This section might be about as long as the discovery depending on your textbook. 

We will then spend an entire chapter talking about why the British are assholes ~~(sorry Scotland and Wales, no one recognizes you at this point in our education.~~ [ALL OF BRITAIN, EQUALLY!](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/8ntkl4/i_too_tried_to_draw_europe_from_memory_problem_is/dzze66z/?context=3) Ireland is presumed to not be part of the UK by virtue of being Ireland. Americans learn to love the Irish from a young age so we're biased.) Fortunately, it's at this point that America invented the Freedom.

Then we talk about America for the next 6 months of schooling and why we're the best but also assholes. The first 2 months how we won the revolution with nothing in our favor but our massive balls (except local support, excellent leadership, an entire fucking ocean that gets regarded as fairly trivial, and the fact that the UK had the rest of the world to worry about). The next two months are about why slavery is bad but maybe something something states rights something something OH SHIT THEY SHOT LINCOLN. Reconstruction dicks the South and that'll get resolved eventually* but hey look at all this cool shit we invent in the 1900's like railroads and modernized impoverishment hey that's pretty cool. Then Europe gets in war to see who can build the best ditch and we eventually come in. Then it's won. One can only presume we did this. Then something something American is in charge of all the money something something OH SHIT ITS HITLER.

For those of you unaware, Hitler was the most Germanic German to ever German. He was incapable of speaking without shouting, and he punched their failing economy in the face and yelled at it until he was elected führer, the position having previously been occupied by the spiralling Deutschmark something something wheelbarrows of money. The next 2 months will be about watching historical documentaries like Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers. We study about how America invented the noocyular bomb, which was invented by Albert Einstein, the anti-hitler. We then proceeded to stick it to Germany by taking our nukes and shoving them right up Japan's Ass. Take that, Germany!

After which the AP tests are on the way. Quick! Better cram in something about soviets! Korea! Bay of Pigs! Vietnam! Mutually Assured Destruction politics, lest we forget about our lord and savior (we're the original Children of the Atom, you know) - The rough summary is that America has nukes and no one else does, so we rule the world.

**Email your MEP**

Use this [tool](https://www.saveyourinternet.eu/) to ensure your representative is speaking up and stopping rules that impose censorship through content filtering.

You can use our points below to help construct an original message in your own words.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

**What to write?**

- Creativity and free speech will be harmed by Article 13 because algorithms struggle to tell the difference between infringement and the legal use of copyrighted material vital to research, commentary, parodies and more. This is far too high a cost for enforcing copyright. 

- No filter can possibly review every form of content covered by the proposal including text, audio, video, images and software. Article 13's mandate is technically infeasible and it is absurd to expect courts in 27 EU Member States to be constantly working out what the “best” filters might be.

- It is a bad idea to make Internet companies responsible for enforcing copyright law. To ensure compliance and avoid penalties, platforms are sure to err on the side of caution and overblock. To make compliance easier, platforms will adjust their terms of service to be able to delete any content or account for any reason. That will leave victims of wrongful deletion with no right to complain – even if their content was perfectly legal.

1746,"(please note: I'm not a law expert. I'm posting this as my current best interpretation of the legal situation, considering nobody else has stepped up to the plate).

The first half of your post is actively misleading. The vote on June 20th, if favorable, will resolve the disagreement and allow the proposal to pass. Article 13 would be passed as part of the entire proposal. Considering how well you seem to know your way around the source, I don't think you have incompetence as an excuse.

&gt; In fact, the current version of Article 13 doesn't really differ from how laws on liability for sharing copyrighted content are done today.

Point (a) of paragraph 4 is new, different, and worrisome:

&gt; 4\. In the absence of the authorisation referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 1,
Member States shall provide that an online content sharing service provider shall not be liable
for acts of communication to the public or making available to the public within the meaning
of this Article when:

&gt; (a) it demonstrates that it has made best efforts to prevent the availability of specific works
or other subject matter by implementing effective and proportionate measures, in
accordance with paragraph 5, to prevent the availability on its services of the specific
works or other subject matter identified by rightholders and for which the rightholders
have provided the service with relevant and necessary information for the application of
these measures; and

&gt; (b) upon notification by rightholders of works or other subject matter, it has acted
expeditiously to remove or disable access to these works or other subject matter and it
demonstrates that it has made its best efforts to prevent their future availability through
the measures referred to in point (a).

This addition requires content hosts to *actively* monitor all uploaded data for the presence of copyrighted material once they have been given basic instructions on how to recognize the material. The weasel-worded protections of paragraph 5 which you quote are undermined by the open-ended vagueness of paragraph 8:

&gt; 8\. The Commission and the Member States shall encourage stakeholder dialogues to define best
practices for the measures referred to in point (a) of paragraph 4. Member States shall also
endeavour to establish mechanisms to facilitate the assessment of the effectiveness and
proportionality of these measures and provide the Commission regularly with information on
those mechanisms. The Commission shall, in consultation with online content sharing service
providers, rightholders and other relevant stakeholders and taking into account the results of
the stakeholder dialogues and the national mechanisms, issue guidance on the application of
the measures referred to in point (a) of paragraph 4.

If they demand too much filtering at too little cost, hosts will be forced to blanket ban things which might look offensive.

If they demand filtering at too much cost, hosts will be unable to provide services to the EU market which they are able to provide elsewhere, stifling European development on every front which can be represented digitally.

If 'stakeholders' agree that third party verification is an acceptable tool, then all hosts will have a strong financial incentive to send everything you post to third parties for analysis of its intellectual content.",The Netherlands,/r/europe/comments/8nqyvo/article_13_will_be_passed_on_the_20th_of_june_we/dzygpp1/,philip1201,1527881004

Assuming that you create some sort of successful business and your children inherit incredible wealth, they will receive passive income through investments, but that income was accumulated through your hard work. Did your children work hard to receive that wealth? Not at all, but you did and you chose who to give that money to, you could have also given it all to charity through your will.

&gt;Ok, but was this one an attempt or limited success at ethnic cleansing? You insist on dodging the question. Why can't to provide a straight, clear cut answer? I do so when you ask.

It wasn't ethnic cleansing according to me. As simple as that. A Turk dies in Germany and you will call it ethnic cleansing it seems.

1841,"This generation of political leaders in Spain is very weak. They are mostly just polititians

PSOE: Sanchez, new president, no relevant previous experience. Appeared as surprise leader of the party in 2014 when he seemed somewhat charismatic and handsome young man. The old leaders teamed around a corrupt leader and tried to get rid of him. We returned thanks to the voting of the party members, which may suggest hope for a change in an otherwise corrupt party (search Andalucia and Susana Diez).

- Rivera, Ciudadanos, got in power by betraying the party founders (who allegedly took money from German secret service to create the party). He had always very poor results in Catalonia, and the worst ones in 2009 after shifting from their original center left to far right (where it has remained) by colluding with Libertas.  Gained support from media and IBEX35 companies that see him ans the replacement for the crumling PP.

- Pablo Iglesias: founder of Podemos, former university teacher of politic science, and vocal defendant of the 15M movement in tv shows. He became so influential that founded the party with other people alike. Has limited media support, with most of it bashing the party at every step. Is the most populist of the party leaders and has shown some actions that raise some questions (the purchase of his new house for example). His current partner and party speaker is showing to be more promising than him.

Whataboutism. I am not talking about Armenian genocide here. There is also a question of bias. British were known as supporters of Armenians, Greeks and Arabs, but certainly not Turks. So, such letter signed by high level British officers is actually more credible as they were biased against us.

In Palestine there were riots and pogroms against Jews in 1920 and 1921. Tensions over the Western Wall in Jerusalem led to the 1929 Palestine riots,[19] whose main victims were the ancient Jewish community at Hebron which came to an end.

he Mufti of Jerusalem Amin al-Husayni staged a pro-Nazi coup in Iraq and organized the Farhud pogrom which marked the turning point for about 150,000 Iraqi Jews who, following this event and the hostilities generated by the war with Israel in 1948, were targeted for violence, persecution, boycotts, confiscations, and near complete expulsion in 1951.

In reaction to the Suez Crisis of 1956, the Egyptian government expelled almost 25,000 Egyptian Jews and confiscated their property, and sent approximately 1,000 more Jews to prisons and detention camps. The population of Jewish communities of Muslim Middle East and North Africa was reduced from about 900,000 in 1948 to less than 8,000 today.


 Unlike Europe the Arabs and muslims never had a ""Jewish problem"". Problems only started when Jews from Europe came to Palestine

he eleventh century saw Muslim pogroms against Jews in Spain; those occurred in Córdoba in 1011 and in Granada in 1066.[84] In the 1066 Granada massacre, a Muslim mob crucified the Jewish vizier Joseph ibn Naghrela and massacred about 4,000 Jews.

The Almohad dynasty, which overthrew the dynasty that ran Spain during the early Muslim era, offered Christians and Jews the choice of conversion or expulsion; in 1165, one of their rulers ordered that all Jews in the country convert on pain of death

1679 The Exile of Mawzaʻ (the expulsion of Yemenite Jews to Mawza') Hebrew: גלות מוזע‬, pronounced [ğalūt mawzaʻ];‎ 1679–1680, is considered the single most traumatic event experienced collectively by the Jews of Yemen,[1] in which Jews living in nearly all cities and towns throughout Yemen were banished by decree of the king, Imām al-Mahdi Ahmad, and sent to a dry and barren region of the country named Mawzaʻ to withstand their fate or to die

&gt;Researchers from the Geography Department of Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin (HU) led the creation of the first map of Europe’s last wild forests, including more than 1.4 million hectares in 34 European countries. „It is not that these forests were never touched by man, this would be hard to believe in Europe”, explains Dr. Francesco Maria Sabatini, lead author of the study. „Still, these are forests where there are no clearly visible indications of human activities, maybe because blurred by decades of non-intervention, and where the ecological processes follow a natural dynamics.” The compilation of the map was a huge task, according to the authors. „We contacted hundreds of forest scientists, experts and NGO activists from all over Europe asking to share information on where to find such forests in their country. Without their direct engagement we could have never been able to build our database, which is the most comprehensive ever compiled for Europe.”",Finland,/r/europe/comments/8nsqjq/known_primary_forests_in_europe_humboldt/dzy0eoe/,MasherusPrime,1527866866

2121,"&gt; If the media keeps promoting Ciudadanos ultra-nationalistic speeches, the public opinion in this matter will still be the same.

Except Sanchez how has the golden opportunity to actually resolve the Catalan issue.  No easy feat by any stretch of the imagination, but if he is able to resolve it by keeping the Catalans *happily* **within** Spain, then he can run on a platform as the Great Spanish Uniter and easily win the next elections.

Ciudadanos, on the other hand, has absolutely no solution or plan for the Catalan issue except ""more 155"" until the non-independence parties win in Catalonia.  But the Catalans have already proven that if they get pushed, they will push back equally hard, so a different approach is needed to resolve that issue.  The PSOE party now has a golden opportunity to resolve the it, and if they manage to do so, I predict they will easily win the next elections for he would have achieved what no one else could.

Remember, the more the Spanish Government pushes the Catalans, the more the Catalans push back, and the more the Catalans push back, the more the Spanish Nationalists push back, creating a wider and wider gap.

2163,"Their own thing. I think you assume that it's like a hard rejection of European roots or something, which looks preposterous to you. But it's more about feeling like an own civilisation I guess.  

I've found a poll by Open Democracy that asked questions about feeling European. They were polling Crimeans, but gave some comparisons with Ukrainian results. 

&gt;Third, we asked Crimeans to what extent they felt European. Unlike residents of western and central Ukraine who tend to readily self-identify in these terms, the strong majority (85%) of the population of Crimea do not perceive themselves as European. Respondents in the six regions in south-east Ukraine were evenly split on this question, with 45% identifying definitely or probably yes while 45% identified as definitely or probably no. Again, Tatars show some differences on this question from other Crimeans, though it is not as dramatic as others; less than half of this Muslim minority see themselves as European.

&gt;Identification as European is, of course, strongly contextual and fluid: some Russians readily embracing this identity while some British, for example, actively reject it. The extent to which it has become a marker of a ‘civilisational divide’ in Ukraine, in opposition to a notion like the ‘Russkiy Mir’ (Russian world), is an important question. Certainly, the Kremlin has invested strongly in this notion, and more recently in the concept of separate civilisations. In Crimea, at least, the evidence suggests this is working – 89% of respondents agreed that Crimea belonged to Russkiy Mir, the mirror opposite of European feeling. In south-east Ukraine, the equivalent figure underscores the divide, with 51% strongly or mostly agreeing that their region belongs to the Russkiy Mir.

2177,"&gt; This can't be stable since the opposition can overthrow them anytime with a no confidence vote (like now).

The main obstacle for this is that a no confidence vote is designed to be hard to pass in Spain. Keep in mind that while roughly half of all Spanish governments have been minority governments, only this one has been successful.

To pass a no confidence vote you need:

* An alternative ""PM designate"" who will automatically become PM if the vote is successful. This means that it's harder to pass, since far left parties who might not support the centre-left government, won't support a right wing candidate either. For exmaple.

* An overall majority. While to become PM you only need a simple majority, to oust the current one you need an overall majority; 176 votes; not just more ""yes"" than ""no"".

Granted, Sánchez's government will still be extremely unstable but the system is designed to be hard to overthrow a PM. Keep in mind that while Rajoy had more MPs, he still didn't have a majority.

The key here is that Auschwitz has been built in specific area: close to everywhere, but essentially in the middle of nowhere. If you visit Poland, Kraków is a great destination. But it's also far from other landmarks. So to get from it anywhere else, you pass Auschwitz. What you gonna do, NOT visit? 

Seriously though - Wieliczka is the place that you cannot see elsewhere. 

And Auschwitz as depressing as it is, is an important remainder of how viciously cruel people can get.

&gt; The chlorine washing of food, the controversial “cleaning” technique used by many US poultry producers who want access to the British market post-Brexit, does not remove contaminants, a new study has found.

&gt; The investigation, by a team of microbiologists from Southampton University and published in the US journal mBio, found that bacilli such as listeria and salmonella remain completely active after chlorine washing. The process merely makes it impossible to culture them in the lab, giving the false impression that the chlorine washing has been effective.

They also sunk cargo ships which brought food and aid to India. 

Churchill is always associated with this famine but I don’t see why. This famine was mainly caused by a combination of World War 2 and drought, flooding, and climate.

2287,"&gt;You live in an 8sq m apartment and you're voting for the party that made sure the previous gen had housing, but you have none

None of the other parties have policies that would improve chance for me either, they just proclaim loudly that it's all the others fault. Only folks that are really offering an alternative in that regard would be PVDA. And I have many issues with them in other fields. Any test I take ends up Green/CD&amp;V/Open VLD so it's not like I am a single issue voter. The world is bigger than just my housing, and I am working myself up in how I live.

&gt;Liberalising all of the things you just mentioned caused the situation Greece is now in. We had the money to bail them out and force them to reform, but instead we threw millions into abject poverty to teach them a lesson.

Hmm, how odd. You seem to forget how Greece got into a position where we decided to throw millions into abject poverty. In 2004, while Greece was pretending it's deficit was 1.5% it was actually 8.3%. As Greece was hiding this, it was in no position to suddenly reduce spending so it continued borrowing like there was no tomorrow. Spending went into services for the people the state itself just couldn't afford. Mainly the people that voted for the party now in power (it switched every now and then, there were two big ones). 

When the 2007 crisis hit, Greece was in a position where spending was so much below income that the system itself couldn't survive when incomes dropped even lower. 

That's the cause of the crisis, not liberalising the economy. Beyond that, I am not a fan of the European response to the crisis. Demanding harsh reforms and spending reductions (those two are linked) is fine but only coupled with a bailout. What we did instead was giving extremely low intrest loans, which is better than what would have happened if we hadn't done anything but still not enough to stop an economy in meltdown.

Pretending the only reason why Greece is such a disaster is the response to it ruining itself, seems just dishonest. By the way, most people were quite vocal against giving Greece ""free"" money at the time. On all sides of the spectrum. I wasn't(due to being quite pro-EU) and maybe you weren't, but it wasn't just heartless liberals who stopped us from helping Greece.

2305,"I propose nothing. It's Ukrainians' business how to call themselves.
Just pointing out that you can't be a Cossack, a not-Russian heart of Russia and a proto-Sumerian at the same time.

I do believe that biggest FU possible to current Moscow regime would be to proclaim yourself, I dunno, Republic of Ruthenia, laying equal claim to Russian cultural and historical heritage, just highlighting that current Muscovite regime is neither cultural, nor historical and is plain hostile to Rusian-ness. And ditch the village speak in favour of a Russian language, with a special institute in Kiev deciding on its norms, customs and vocabulary, like maybe make some tweak it proclaim it ""the better norm"" than the one made by some Bolshevik Jews 70 years ago for a Georgian dictator. The Austrians and the German-Swiss don't have to invent some Swiss or Austrian language out of some village speech from the mountains, presumably because they never were butchered by the commies, even though as I recall their norms are slightly different from German ones.

So there you go, a ""better"", ""old school"", ""original"" Russia of Kiev opposed to ""bad"", ""corrupted"", ""upstart"" Russia of Moscow that perhaps had it century of fame but should now let Pappa Kiev show how it's done. Plus it has all that Ukrainian folk preserved as, you know, folk, not state ideology of million strong cities roleplaying at borderlander ~~cowboys~~ cossacks. With optional call of ""Russians go home"" to attract the better educated workforce and deny it to Moscow, without the workforce having to roleplay as fringe villagers to pass for a local nor suck it up to some Russophobic non-entity on the fringes of EU. I'm pretty sure it would be a blast that to let the Bolshevik grandkiddied burst in flames for months at a time and kill loads of vicious memes built on Ukrainian identity contradiction of being ""a true Russia totally not Moscow don't steal"" and ""some Borderland village"" at the same time.

But that wouldn't never go well with Soviet Jews in power and their pretty Sovietized colleagues/underlings, I presume. Lukashenko himself is pretty shifty when proclaiming how we were totally the Great Lithuania and Belarusian Peoples Republic, before shifting back into Soviet mode when the message is received at Kremlin. And, of course, the Ukrainians themselves should either want it, or be attracted to a more prestigious option.

Until then they will remain Borderlanders from fringe anarchic villages at the Wild Field who due to some Stalin's quirks got loads of territories with shaky claims on them and a most ridiculous historiography ever with ""The State of Capitol (the Borderland)"" instead of the ""The state of Russia, with Kiev it's mother and heart"".",Belarus/Moscow:orly:,/r/europe/comments/8ngq3d/ukraine_in_numbers_1919/dzxfuc9/,Qumielhan,1527837528

2314,"&gt;Having respect for lives and individuality is the basis of liberalism. &lt;

True but a fetus is not enough of an advanced form of life to have any rights and a fetus can't be given any rights without depriving pregnant women of rights: thus abortion should be legal at all stages to protect women's rights. 

&gt;You could very well be in favor of abortion with a 16 weeks limits&lt;

That's insanely conservative; such a policy would severely restrict and violate women's rights and reproductive freedom. Your stance is also identical to what most Trump supporters want.

&gt;A fetus at 8 months is viable, it’s a human being&lt;

I don't care, it's much better to have occasional abortions of eight month year olds instead of giving the state more power over women. 

&gt;the liberty of human being stops where the liberty of another human being begins&lt;

That only applies to people who have been born, you can't restrict abortion without restricting the freedom of pregnant women. Also your policy would lead to women being forced to give birth which is a serious human rights violation.

&gt;It doesn’t magically acquire rights once it gets out of the womb.&lt;

It shouldn't have any rights before birth in order to protect the rights of pregnant women: people come before a clump of cells with potential to become people.

Unfortunately most of the past sources regarding Balkan Wars are biased and against Turks. And unlike actions of Ottomans towards its minorities, I don't think much research went into Balkan Muslims.

They didn't demolish it. They surrounded it with modern skyscrapers of their own. So the message was reversed - during the communist times Poland was made poor and subservient and got just one weird looking skyscraped, but a free and stronger Poland now has one and a half dozen skyscrapers built by themselves, not stolen from common Russians' slave labour by some dictator alien and hostile to them.

Now that's a strong message of a people not afraid of its past and making it's better future on the go. Plus they started to build a skyscraper about a third higher than the Academy of Sciences left by Stalin, so it won't be dominating the sky line anyway in some years.

Instead of drones like u/eksiarvamus blowing up things they are incapable of appreciating nor building on their own like some triggered monkeys, they'd better learn from Poles not to be afraid of history and make their own prestige by their own hands.

There is no real long\-term stability, because the political model is not based off of that \- there are long term development plans, but these plans are for governments and agencies that will change their composition.

Even Jewish websites will confirm that in the early 20th century Jews represented between 10% to 30% of the entire population and most of them were immigrants from Europe. The true natives of the land who have real roots and connection to the land going back several generations are Palestinians. 

Finally Jordan was virtually empty during the time of the British mandate, while Palestinian cities were vibrant urban centres full of activity and history. So it is the opposite of your revisionist propaganda. It is the Jordanians, about 40% to 60% of them who are displaced Palestinians, not the other way round because historically it was the West Bank of the river Jordan that was populated and built up and not the east bank.

You didn’t understand my point. My point is you guys believe in a system without questioning it, just like religion. Why do you have a two-party systems ? That’s what I’m questioning, it doesn’t make any sense that you are either pro abortion and for more tax, or against abortion and for less tax. It doesn’t make sense, yet it’s how it’s organized and this system is not questioned. Just like religion.

Second, it’s a simple fact, and actually based on a lot of research (I live in Taiwan, I have been a lot in China, I’m writing my thesis on China). The education system is made in a way that it doesn’t teach critical thinking, it teaches that the CCP is the only one who knows the desire of the Chinese people. The fact that the CCP must be governing China is not questioned, just like the teachings of a holy book are not questioned.

2469,"Except that the note is talking about the possible massacres which 
could happen in a Greek and Turkish War (which both happened). The article I linked you is discussing the Greek War of Independence itself.

It's not like the article fails to mention reasons on why the Greeks might be angry (one of the reasons I mentioned the Independence War is that it specifically mentions Chios, which was a major prosperous Greek island that the Ottomans decided to slaughter because some Greek rebels put a flag there despite the Chios Greeks desire to stay neutral) and might commit massacres on memopry of that.

Also, the information seems to come from the Carnegie Commission. It is not referring to Greek slaughtering Muslims, but the slaughter Greeks committed on Bulgarians and the brutality of it. It is done in context that no harm was reported on the Greeks in Anatolia. 

This is the [Carnegie Commission report](https://archive.org/stream/reportofinternat00inteuoft/reportofinternat00inteuoft_djvu.txt). The part mentioning Greek barbarities on Bulgarians in Serres is on Page 89. 

&gt;The main concern of the Archbishop's Greek militia during this week was apparently to hunt down the Bulgarian population within the town and in some of the neighboring villages. It is conceivable that this measure may have been dictated in the first instance by the fear that the small Bulgarian minority inside Serres would cooperate with the enemy who attacked it from without. An armed Greek mob followed a few uniformed men from house to house, threatening the Bulgarians and all who should assist them to hide, Their houses were pillaged and their wives ill treated, while the men were arrested and taken singly or in batches to the Bishop's palace ; there they were brought before a commission of laymen over whom a priest presided. Whatever money they possessed was taken from them by this priest, and the only question asked about them was, whether they were or were not Bulgarians. This process was witnessed by Dr. Klugmann, and the testimony of this Russian doctor entirely confirms that of our Bulgarian peasant witnesses. From the bishopric the prisoners were taken to the neighboring Greek girls' high school. In the school they were closely confined in several rooms by fifties and sixties. Fresh batches arrived continuously from the town and from the villages, until the total number of imprisoned Bulgarians reached 200 or 250. The gaolers were in part citizens of Serres, some of whom can be named, and in part uniformed irregulars. From the first they behaved with gross cruelty. The prisoners were tightly bound and beaten with the butt ends of rifles. The plan of the gaolers was apparently to slaughter their prisoners in batches, and they were led two by two to an upper room, where they were killed, usually by repeated wounds in the head and neck inflicted with a butcher's knife or a Martini bayonet. Each of the butchers aimed at accounting for fourteen men, which was apparently the number which each could bury during the night. The massacre went on in this leisurely way until Friday, the 11th. The prisoners included a few captured Bulgarian soldiers, a few peasants taken with arms in their hands (see evidence of the villager Lazarov, Appendix B, No. 20), and at least one local Bulgarian, Christo Dimitrov (Appendix B, No. 19), who was known to be an active associate of the Bulgarian bands. The immense majority were, however, inoffensive tradesmen or peasants whose only offense was that they were Bulgarians. Among them were four women, who were killed with the rest. The only mitigating circumstance is that five lads were released in pity for their youth, after seeing their fathers killed before their eyes. (See Blagoi Petrov, Appendix B, No. 21.) We are unwilling to dwell on the detailed barbarities of this butchery, of which more than enough is recorded in the appendices. 

This was a report done by people who were largely Grecophiles, who read and were inspired by the Greek rebels in the Greek Wars of Independence. 

TLDR: The report is claiming worry on Greek cold-bloodiness due to savagery of their actions in Serres when compared to the Turkish behavior to the Greeks in Turkey proper. They were somewhat right but they severely underestimated the cold-bloodiness of the Young Turks and the new Republicans.

2505,"&gt; Dude. Completely different situations. Germany was done and there was no will nor need to continue. This was after a world war with most of the male population in fighting age (and children too) injured, dead or traumatized, the logistics completely broken, no food left and 3 different armies supressing every speck of resistance. 

Except that in Germany you had communists, the Nazi remnants (like, a fuckton of them especially in the West which the Christian Democrats and the German Lutheran Church defended from the Americans going berserk on them) and the rest of the moderates. The only major difference was that both sides agreed on the new borders and the Allies were not in the middle of two enemy nations which the Allies also followed by angering and threatening (Syria and Iran). 

&gt;And the comment about the nazis having no talent makes no sense.

I keep hearing of this amazing German talent in the mediocrity of shitcountry known as Nazi Germany, yet outside of maybe two (von Braun and Strughold), I keep seeing very little evidence of it, from their economics to the, lol, logistics. Or lolgistics. Or let's invade the USSR lacking fuel but don't worry we will attack the Caucasus to get the oil but the invasion got foiled because the tanks ran out of fuel. 

Any real talent had already left the country by that point. 

&gt;Attacking iraq was a stupid and inhumane idea all around. A war for wars sake. Killing people for own interests. And leading to further destabilisation.

2513,"Imperial = empire = a supreme entity that directly controls the politics of annexed territory.

The US hasn't qualified under that definition since roughly the Philippines in the early 20th century. Since then it has joined/created defensive alliances, specifically NATO and the Mutual Security Treaty with Japan, which require bases to actually, you know, work. If the US took 8 hours to sail across the Pacific to Japan, or some equal time to get to West Germany to fight off the USSR, a coming war may very well be lost by the time we get there to help.

The hidden benefit to having a base that no one seems to consider is that any invasion would automatically draw American politicians into war, because Americans stationed there would immediately die. That's a complete opposite situation compared to what the British did to Poland right on the cusp of WW2, where their ""defensive pact"" with Poland was as worthless as the piece of paper it was written on. Like it or not, politicians are slimy bastards who choose to dishonor agreements and contracts when they can slime their way out at little cost. American military bases (in 9 of 10 cases) represent a commitment of skin in the game.

2552,"This is some straight up /r/iamverysmart shit, but I still feel like we're talking past each other so I'm going to break it down.

A. What we agree on

* German civilian population on the home front was insulated from the military reality at the front. 

* ""Expectation v reality"" of what peace would look like for Germany

B. What we disagree on

* Germany's strategic position in November 1918

&gt;it was an incredibly harsh treaty for the conditions of the war theatre at the moment of the armistice

I have to disagree completely on this point. Beginning in 1916 you have severe food shortages hitting the German civilian population. In October of 1918 the Hindenburg Line has been penetrated and compromised. You have the Kiel Mutiny starting on November 3, 1918 and the subsequent November Revolution. The Ottoman Empire is collapsing internally and withdraws form the war, the Austro-Hungarian Empire is itself collapsing and its army is in no shape to take the field. This leaves Germany with mutiny and rebellion at home, a starving populace, it's last prepared defensive position breached, 2 million fresh American soldiers in the field with another 2 million on the way, the very real possibility its army won't survive the winter of 1918, and the coming Allied offensive in the Spring of 1919.

* The centrality of the Versailles Treaty to both the rise of the Nazi Party and its ideology 

(it's late and I have work in the morning), but basically I think we need to consider:

0. The primordial importance of Anton Drexler
1. November Revolution and the Freikorps
2. The Bavarian Soviet Republic
3. Economic condition of inter-war Germany
4. The Völkisch movement
5. The aid of the Reichswehr

as a whole more important to the rise of the Nazis than just the neat simple ""Versailles explanation""

My problem is that too often explanations for the rise of the Nazi Party ignore or minimize the social, economic, military, and political conditions which made it possible. The Versailles Treaty is a part of this and a contributing factor, but we need to be careful to not over emphasize it.

2559,"&gt;Firstly 'everyone being there' isn't an excuse, everyone was in Africa during the scramble, 'everyone' was in East Asia, 'everyone' was in the Americas and so on. Secondly the ""just ISIS"" thing is a myth, as anyone following the war can tell you. American bases in Al\-Tanf and the pressure on the Kurds to rush to Al\-Bukamal was obviously to put a barrier between Syria and Iraq \(and thus Iran\). There have also been multiple instances of Americans targeting regime forces, and of course heavy material support to rebels, especially in the early stages.

The ""just ISIS"" think is no longer really true now because they're defeated. I don't know about you, but I actually like the Kurds and don't like Assad. Either way, ""everyone being there"" isn't an excuse, but it doesn't really criticize the US if France, the UK, Russia, Iran, every Arab state, and Turkey are all involved. Hell, even Canada and Australia have sent a few fighter jets. If supporting Democratic Kurds in Syria is imperialism.... then it doesn't really feel like imperialism or that bad. I don't think there have been many instances of the US deliberately targeting regime forces. That's mostly just fog of war or isolated instances. The regime, Russia, and the US do their best to stay away from each other.

&gt;That's not why the embargo was implemented, and also not true about the CMC either. The embargo was put in place because Cuba nationalised businesses in Cuba owned by Americans, who had profited under their puppet Batista.

This is true. I just looked at the dates now. Yeah, the US was pissed at Castro for nationalizing businesses. But Batista was not a US puppet. Batista was a Cuban dictator who seized power at 2 times in Cuban history. Once in 1933 and later again in 1952. You might not like the US, and you might assume that every dictator in Latin America is somehow a US puppet, but that's not the case. Many Latin American countries have had dozens of dictators for the last 200 years. Batista was recognized by the US government. But the US government actually imposed an arms embargo on Batista in 1958 during the Cuban Revolution, which weakened his regime in its fight with Castro. 

When Fidel Castro first came to power, he was really popular. Everyone in the US knew that Batista was nasty and Castro had not told anybody that he was a communist. Castro participated in a normal provisional government for a few months with many prominent Cuban statesmen, then basically led an internal coup again and announced to the world he was a communist and a communist government was taking over. Then he said there would be no more elections and nationalized US businesses. 

&gt;The CMC started because a\) The US put missiles in Turkey and b\) Cuba wanted more security after the failed bay of pigs invasion \(in which the Americans tried to overthrow a government they disagreed with\). WW3 almost started because America couldn't tolerate another nation having nukes and being nearby. Justifiably perhaps, but surely the same would apply to Cuba 'tolerating' the US having nukes.

Yeah this is true. One thing I will say though, is that WW3 never really almost started. What happened was that the US knew Russians were in Cuba and U2 Spy planes took pictures of the Russians while they were still building the missile platforms. The whole reason that JFK started the Cuban missile crisis was because the Russian missiles in Cuba were not yet operational. 

Basically, the US is obviously really far away from Russia. In 1962, the US had way way more nuclear ICBMs than Russia did and Russia's weren't very accurate. If a nuclear war had broken out during the CMC, then few bombs would have hit US cities while Russia would have been wiped out by the US. \(Russia built a large number of ICBMS by the late 1960s, but the US had a gigantic missile and missile tech advantage in 1962 during the CMC.\)

During the CMC, the US military went on full alert and bombers were waiting outside of Soviet Airspace. The Soviet Military never actually mobilized and stood down. The whole reason that the US escalated the CMC so much was because everyone knew the missile platforms in Cuba were not operational yet. It wasn't really that much of a crisis, the US was never going to fire the first nuke at Russia, and Russia couldn't launch nukes at the US \(because everyone knew that if Russia did launch nukes, then it wouldn't do that much damage while the US missiles in Europe would wipe out all European Russia.\)  It was like a Mexican standoff where the US had a bazooka and Russia had a throwing star. JFK knew he could escalate the crisis safely because if he waited too long, the Cuban missiles platforms WOULD become operational and the whole US would be in range by these more accurate shorter range missiles, but he could actually bomb the shit out of the platforms before they became operational and the Russians wouldn't do anything. 

But I don't think it makes sense to say ""the same would apply to Cuba tolerating the US having nukes."" First off, the missiles in Cuba were not the Cuban government's missiles, they belonged to the Soviet Union and were built and operated by Soviet personnel. The US did not have to tolerate Cuba having nukes because it didn't own any, the US refused to tolerate the USSR having nukes located in Cuba, and then the USSR did not want to tolerate US missiles in Turkey \(which by the same logic were US property, and not Turkish missiles\). What Cuba thought was irrelevant because Cuba is not a nuclear power. Castro actually asked Khrushchev to launch nukes during the crisis and he thought Castro was out of his mind and said no. 

&gt;[Here is a slightly longer list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_involvement_in_regime_change#Cold_War_era), also you can't just say 'some people asked us to do it'. Its usually pretty easy to find a few people asking for an invasion, and empires have used that tactic for years to justify invasions. \(Notably the invasion that Braveheart is based around, and the invasion of Afghanistan by the USSR were both invited\).

Hmmm.... Ok, going through the Cold War Era these are the ones I reject for regime change:

 The Korean War was not regime change. Korea was a colony of Japan occupied by Japan during World War II. The US and USSR both jointly occupied Korea as per agreement \(it was not an independent country\). The original plan was to have nationwide elections, but the US setup a capitalist government in the South, and the USSR a Stalinist one in the Norther \(the current North Korean government\). Both parties reneged on the partition and just went to war when North Korea invaded South Korea. There was no ""regime change"", the article says that some guy setup Committees in Korea a few weeks before US troops landed. These committees were not a regime. And the whole point was that the US expected there to be UN elections ASAP and then leave. Anyway, ask South Korea today if they're happy we went to war or if they would have preferred we let the USSR setup a group that would take over all the country?

Chinese Civil war makes no sense. The US wasn't supporting regime change. The Nationalists were the original regime before Mao won. From the US point of view the US was supporting the actual government against communist rebels. The Nationalists had the original UN seat before it moved from Taiwan to Mainland China later. 

Greek civil war makes no sense. We were supporting the actual government of Greece. 

Italy is sort of true in 1948, but the fact of the matter was that Italy declared war on the US in World War II in 1941. You can't declare war on the US for no reason and then complain when the US defeats and occupies your country and interferes with you. That post 1948 stuff I think refers to Operation Gladio, which was a stay behind operation in case Italy was invaded. I mean whatever. 

Shit, well yeah maybe there is a lot of later shit we did in Latin America.

&gt;Yeltsin 1996: Admittedly rigged is a strong word, but US pressure towards the IMF and involvement in that election is pretty widely known, and it certainly was interference.

Uh... Ok. Ignoring the fact that the US did everything legal and above board, the opponent to Yeltsin was the Communist Party guy that wanted a return to communism. It should be noted, that the Soviet Communist Party interfered a helluva lot in the US during the Cold War. They stole nuclear weapons tech with spies before the cold war even began and then they began the cold war when Stalin, the head of the Soviet Communist Party, reneged on his agreement with us \(when we were allies\) to introduce free elections in Eastern Europe after World War II. 

I mean, the Soviet Communist Party, and its successor the Russian Communist Party at the time, had a long history with the US. They're not exactly an innocent party here, they've fucked with us plenty over the years. I'm not losing sleep because we asked an organization to give Russia a loan at a time Russia did need money. 

&gt;Petrodollar: They make imports cheaper, and let more money be printed and borrowed without the usual problem. Strong currencies are pretty good, devaluing them is a stabilising measure. If a weak currency is actually beneficial why isn't every country in the world printing so much currency their's becomes worthless? It also has other benefits to do with debt and so on. America tolerates and encourages the petrodollar \- if it hurt it why would they?

First of all, I have no idea what this has to do with imperialism. There has to be SOME widely used form of international currency to move commerce. The US is the natural choice because we had the largest economy, the most currency in circulation, and you know what: we drilled the first oil well in a town called Titusville, Pennsylvania in 1859 and we created the modern oil industry. Like 2/3 of world oil was produced in the US during World War II and there were lots of US oil companies. Hell, my family farm has an oil field. The US Dollar was the natural choice for the international oil trading currency for a host of good reasons that have nothing to do with imperialism. 

Also, US doesn't really like strong currencies. During the Great Depression we experienced massive deflation which killed the economy in a deflationary unemployment spiral. 

And when you say ""make imports cheaper"", yeah that's a bad thing from our point of view. If imports are cheaper, then people will buy imports instead of domestically produced goods. Hurts domestic industry. 

I don't think it makes sense to say ""why isn't every country in the world printing so much currency their's becomes worthless"". There is a balance. If a currency devalues too much to be worthless then it will lose faith as a stable monetary unit. Planning investments would be impossible. 

As regards to ""the US tolerates and encourages the petrodollar,"" I don't really think the pricing of oil in dollars is really that important, I don't really think the US does tolerate and encourage it.  I think it's just a natural market thing since we're the most natural currency to use. 

2 things. 

1. At the end of the day, the only value of the US dollar is the full faith and credit of the US government. That's it. The US could print double the money supply tomorrow to create inflation. The only reason people use the dollar is because people trust the US government not to do that. Also, US federal government is really old. We've been around for 230 years as a country with no coups, no changes of currency, we still even use the same constitution. Basically, we're a pretty fucking stable country that people have faith isn't going anywhere. Take France for example, yeah, it's president is smoother than Trump, but I think France has had like 5 different republics, 1 monarchy, and I think 2 empires  in the last 230 years. It's also been totally occupied and defeated twice by Germany in the 1870s Franco\-Prussian war and Germany in World War II. The US has had only one government, one constitution, one system, and has never been occupied during that same 230 year period. What I'm saying is that people just naturally use the dollar because the use has a really good track record for stability. The Euro on the other hand, has only been around a little while and has had major crises like Greece. 

Rome wasn't built in one day and the popularity of the dollar wasn't either. Give us credit for 230 years at least. The reason that the dollar is the main foreign reserve currency and the Euro is not, is because the Dollar is more likely to be around in 50 years than the Euro. The EU/Euro could presumably break up in 10 years. European civilization might be thousand of years old, and the US only 230 years old, but as far as modern, stable, constitutional countries are concerned, y'all are the new kids on the block and we are the old wise men. People trust our dollars because we've earned it and the Eurozone hasn't yet.

2. It's our dollar, we can do what we want with it. We don't force anyone to use it. Seriously, we used to be a colony too and now we're a sovereign country. We can promote and do whatever we want with it as our right. That's not imperialism, that's sovereignty. I would say it would be imperialism for you to tell us what to do with our own currency. ;0

&gt;It was the Bretton\-Woods system. 

All closely related. The Bretton Woods was created because everyone agree there needed to be one currency everyone else could measure its value against. Like a ruler. The dollar was the only logical currency because the US had the largest gold reserves in the world at the Bretton Woods conference and was also the safest country and most trustworthy to hold onto gold. We still do that a lot

&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Those theories sound like French conspiracy theories more than anything else.  
&gt;  
&gt;I'm genuinely curious as to why French?

Because when you said that in your OP, it reminded me of a Bretton Woods complaint when France criticized this very thing you are referring to. They called it the "" dollars exorbitant privilege""

Lemme tell you a story. My friend's Great Great Uncle was a German\-Jew. He moved to to New York in the 1920's and made millions of dollar in commercial real estate. When World War II broke out, he took all his dollars and converted them into Nazi Reichmarks. He had grown up in Germany and he was objectively convinced that Germany would win the war. Then he lost everything when the Nazi Reichmarks became worthless after the US Army occupied Germany and replaced it with the new West German Deutschemark. 

If dollar imperialism is a real thing, then I'm not saying that we deserve it because we are better than you, but the truth is we actually do deserve it because we are better than you. We have a longer track record of stability. We are in a safer part of the world with few enemies. We are one of the most powerful \(safe\) countries in the world. We are very capitalist so less likely to steal or nationalize your assets. We have very strong rule of law. We're more trustworthy than you. And we've been doing this democracy/constitutional law thing for longer than you. We don't have dollar imperialism because we did anything wrong. We only have it because people have faith in the dollar and we've earned that faith.   ",,/r/europe/comments/8nij73/us_places_steel_tariffs_on_key_allies/dzx5xhv/,sandyhands2,1527824259

2572,"&gt;Imperial = empire = a supreme entity that directly controls the politics of annexed territory.

So you took this definition out of your ass by adding 'directly', which significantly changes it. 

Of course the US isn't directly dictating policies of countries. But the US creates conditions and uses pressure to coerce countries to do things to its benefit. Sometimes its mutual, usually its not. 

If you think the US (or any country) does *anything* out of pure altruism you are incredibly naive. 

I suggest you read about Steven Luke's [Three dimensions of power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Lukes#The_three_dimensions_of_power), a common theory within the sphere of international relations. 

What you described was the 1st A forces B to do something. Its the most obvious and straightforward one. US-led regime change is an example of it. 

The second is a little more subtle: A creates conditions which leave B with only one choice (desired by A). This is one often used both within and outside the US (and other countries too of course). NATO is a good example, where the US places military bases in countries which effectively means that they control the defense policy of that nation under the guise of protection, as the threat of military action is ever present. Some people call it 'soft power'

The third is the most insidious: A creates conditions so that B *wants* to do things to A's benefit, even at their own expense. This one is based around the idea of using ideology to justify certain actions, convince people to go to war, etc etc. 

&gt;The hidden benefit to having a base that no one seems to consider is that any invasion would automatically draw American politicians into war, because Americans stationed there would immediately die. That's a complete opposite situation compared to what the British did to Poland right on the cusp of WW2, where their ""defensive pact"" with Poland was as worthless as the piece of paper it was written on. Like it or not, politicians are slimy bastards who choose to dishonor agreements and contracts when they can slime their way out at little cost. American military bases (in 9 of 10 cases) represent a commitment of skin in the game.

What you describe here is irrelevant because the US knows full well no one will ever engage them militarily, so whether there's a military base in, say, Japan for instance, there is no threat to US security. The military bases are there to project power, nothing more. They want to slowly encricle and isolate Russia because it is their geopolitical enemy.

No, that's the commonly held definition.

&gt;a (1) : a major political unit having a territory of great extent or a **number of territories** or peoples under a **single sovereign authority;** especially : one having an emperor as chief of state (2) : the territory of such a political unit
b : something resembling a political empire; especially : an extensive territory or enterprise **under single domination** or control

https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/empire
&gt; a group of countries **ruled by a single person, government, or country:**

https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/empire
&gt;* An extensive **group of states or countries ruled over by a single monarch,** an oligarchy, or a sovereign state.
&gt;* **Supreme political power** over several countries when **exercised by a single authority.**
&gt;* **Absolute control** over a person or group.

The key ingredients for empire are territory and administration by a single authority. The US has done neither, except in the case of the Philippines, and it certainly does not do it now. Even US ""territories"" like Puerto Rico have full democratic rights to vote to dissolve our relationship or to ascend to full statehood (although in the latter case, our Congress needs to also pass a vote).

&gt;I suggest you read about Steven Luke's Three dimensions of power, a common theory within the sphere of international relations.

I don't know why you're pulling Luke up. He talks about power, which is a broad topic (one that's critical to successful imperialism but doesn't necessarily imply the reverse relationship). You are simply misinformed about what an empire is, so read the above. Until the contemporary US is taking other countries' territory and administering it from a single authority, it's not an empire by any stretch of the definition.

Didn’t. Lapses of logic and straw man.

&gt; Really, what have  I been saying differently? 

Balkan wars caused the Armenian genocide and further suggesting that that narrative from yad vashem is similar to the official Turkish narrative  (“yad vahsem denies the genocide!!”).

&gt; Its so closely intertwined it basically is a universal relationship. The only difference between ethnic cleansing and genocide is the victims of ethnic cleansing have somewhere to flee. it is not an uncommon viewpoint in genocide studies. 

”Its so closely intertwined it basically is a universal relationship. The only difference between robbery and murder is the victims of robbery have somewhere to flee.”

Honey, you wouldn't know what a massive movie studio looked like if it was in your backyard. Come out to Hollywood sometime.

We don't need the government to pay for low quality art around here that makes no money. The movie industry is an actual industry in the US, not a taxpayer charity.

2616,"I will start with something really basic. The Arab peace initiative calls for a two state solution in which Israel withdraws to the 1967 border and a just solution to the refugee problem. In a poll, 70% of Palestinians **accept** the peace initiative and 60% of israelis **reject** it.

Since as a nation you can't speak for every person and i didn't want to start with other thoughts since lots of people might jump on the topic and argue that this person said this or some group said that. This poll shows that majority of Palestinians don't want to destroy Israel, don't want genocide.

Now to more complex things, Palestinians are usually shoved in the corner during negotiations and not for the reason you'd expect. Most negotiations ended by israeli government collapsing since the closer to peace negotiations get the more likely for the israeli government to collapse (or assassination of the israeli leader, in contrast, the governments that don't negotiate last forever). Just before the collapse of the consecutive Israeli governments, in their final weeks they give a half assed proposal like the napkin proposal that ehud olmert even refused to hand to the Palestinians and we only had a quick sketch on a napkin. Offcourse some medias and pro israel consider olmert proposal as a far fetching and blame Palestinians for not accepting. But in reality olmert was on his way out of office (or facing colossal opposition) and we had a napkin map.

Another strategy israel uses for media consumption is the claim they offered Palestinians 96% of the westbank, which is true if you knew what israel acknowledge as westbank. Internationally speaking the westbank is all the area behind the 1967 green line. For Israel it's the same area minus Jerusalem and the Jordan Valley (which is about 40% of the westbank) in that offer ( in which barak was also on his way out of government) Barak wanted to keep those other areas under israeli control for 20 or 40 years with the possibility to renew indefinitely and unilaterally and most notably to own the land underneath the iconic aqsa mosque in Jerusalem.

So, two really ""generous"" proposals to get you a basic understanding. Now I doubt there would be negotiations with the current Israeli government, but in case in the future it happens keep an eye on the israeli politics to notice the trend.

What Palestine wants is; and i do speak on the behalf of apparently 70% of Palestinians ( i don't really want to argue with a barrage of replies about individuals or certain groups that themselves are torn about the issue of the arab peace initiative, 70% of Palestinians endorse it while only 40% of israelis endorse it so please spare my time)

1. Stopping the land theft and construction of illegal colonies (or settlements if you wish)

2. Withdrawing to the 1967 border with some minor changes, swap of lands of equal value ( taking fertile Palestinian lands and giving wasteland is not really a solution)

3. Sharing Jerusalem, Palestinians will have east Jerusalem minus the Jewish quarter and Israel will have west Jerusalem with the Jewish quarter.

4. A just solution for the refugee problem (this one is tricky but we already showed flexibility, as return of elderly people for sentimental and justice reasons, and compensation of the rest)

5. Not interfering with Palestinian economy a la paris agreement that prohibits Palestinians from cultivating certain produce which could rival Israel's or preventing us from using our airspace (which is the case now and during negotiations) and not forcing us to buy israeli electricity for higher the price than in Israel. (also worth noting that israel sells Palestinians water found under the westbank for higher the price than in Israel, so basically selling us our own water for profit)


I don't want to argue with anyone as I expect would happen. But these are the points that I don't think are far fetched, won't genocide anyone or destroy Israel that majority of Palestinians agree upon. I would gladly answer any questions by private message next time.

Edit: some words.
Edit: about me: pretty sleepy right now, it's 04:34. I am a Christian Jerusalem resident, i have israeli id but not citizenship, i have no what you consider as a national number in any country. Getting travel visas is generally more difficult but I am 35 of age with relatively a steady good income so it tends to be easier. I consider myself a Palestinian and would accept in a heartbeat to living in a Palestinian state with the 5 points i pinpointed.

&gt;Playground in India In Helsinki, professional help was needed on Pentecost in the morning.

&gt;\- There was a man saying that the children's paddle is a hedgehog, it is told by the Helsinki rescue service.  
&gt;  
&gt;The task went to make a contract division unit from Malmi vpk, unit number 1395.  
&gt;  
&gt;The destination is in the intersection of Intiankatu and Koskelantie.  
&gt;  
&gt;On the spot it became clear that there was no water in the pool, and that the hedgehog fired inside the ball. It was obvious that Harri Herala had instructions to attack on the wings instead of in the middle.  
&gt;  
&gt;Currently, the hedgehog is on the way to the Wildlife Hospital in Helsinki, as it was slightly injured.  
&gt;  
&gt;The hedgehog would not have been able to get alone from a pool with a height of one meter high.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- Not on those moles, Herala estimates.  
&gt;  
&gt;The usual hedgehogs do not have to be confused with the sea basin, which is a spider\-like spider\-like animal of the marine spider that is propagated by the seabed with the aid of the nose pads.

This is one of the most bizarre comments I ever read onr eddit, which is no easy feat.

1. Non-smokers do in fact live several decades longer on average.

2. Old people are paid pensions, they aren't paying social security.

2685,"&gt;So what is the problem then? If it only affects very few women why are you so worked up about this law, which by the way clearly is also aimed to protect women from abusive husbands. I think it's you who is triggered.

I gave the reasoning in my first post. That's why I'm confused what you're arguing about.
And no that's not a law against abusive husbands. If you want to punish abusive husbands you make a law against them not the victims. Think the other way round. Take an extreme example: You do not punish rapists if you forbid women to wear mini skirts or whatever they want. You punish them by harsher laws against rape, offer counseling services and hotlines for the victims and educate the public. 

&gt;It clearly can be interpreted to fully cover up.

Since almost any normal theologian and historian says the opposite and since almost no Muslim interprets it that way it's unimportant in which way it can be interpreted.

2768,"&gt;But it's not accurate.

It is. A citizen of Serbia, objectively speaking, is very accurately represented by the ""Serbia"" flair. There is no objective counter\-argument to that. If it were possible to have both the flag of Serbia and the Albanian flag, I am pretty sure that the user in question would have gone for that, as it is exactly what he/she does in r/Albania.

&gt;He's clearly arguing from an Albanian point of view against Serbia yet has a Serbian flair.

A citizen of Serbia being critical of Milošević and the Serbian role in the Yugoslav wars of the '90s? Say it ain't so! *It's not ""arguing against Serbia"", by the way, notice the considerable difference.*

If, according to you, only Albanians/Hungarians/Croats/minorities are allowed to oppose that, while Serbs are expected to ""defend Serbian honor and joint stance at any cost"", it says a lot about your mentality, really, which is similar to herd mentality. In real life, I have met a handful of ethnic Serbs from Serbia, living here in Germany, that share the same anti\-Milošević view as the person above.

&gt;Would be pretty stupid of me to argue against Bosnia while using its flair too, in case I didn't have the RS flair, which is the most accurate one for me.

No, it wouldn't. I cannot say this loud enough: **You are a free citizen and you are allowed to be opposed to the politics and policies of the country you're a citizen of.** Thankfully, the era of forced censorship and dictators is gone, and there is absolutely zero need to go back to 19^(th) century rhetoric either.

&gt;Doesn't really matter that he doesn't live in Albania or has citizenship. He's Albanian.

Well, he/she is Albanian by ethnicity. That his/her hometown isn't part of the country of Albania isn't his/her choice and cannot be remedied today. That's just how borders were drawn in 1913, for the better or for the worse. Preševo is in Serbia and Serbia is a multi\-ethnic country; there is no actual conflict between being ethnically Albanian and having the ""Serbia"" flair. I sure hope you're not implying that Serbia should treat its minorities as second\-class citizens and that they're supposed to ""know their place"" online.

&gt;You can't have a stronger tie than that.

I beg to differ. In real life, my ethnicity has zero effects on my rights  \- it's not even marked on my passport \- and nationalism doesn't pay my bills. Personally, I have a stronger tie to the country I live in right now than to the country I come from. How strongly one feels about their ethnicity is a personal matter, but it also does not strip away their citizen rights.

&gt;And I'd say countries do essentially mean nationality here.

Actually, I honestly find this way of thinking quite irrational and outdated. That is how you and some others \(mostly Eastern Europeans\) *choose* to interpret them, and it's often ruining this subreddit's comment sections with all the circle\-jerking and even brigading. 

The intended meaning and the official association of the flags in r/Europe is with countries/regions, not ethnicities, the end. Let's all just get along now, please? Thanks.",Saxony (Germany),/r/europe/comments/8nfwzl/countries_that_recognize_kosovo_vs_countries_that/dzwqqlh/,sharkstax,1527809193

Over half of EU-US trade is not subject to customs duties.

Most of the rest faces widely differing duties, ranging from 1- 3% for basic goods, such as raw materials, and 30% for goods like clothes and shoes.

Some customs duties are so prohibitively high they effectively cut off any trade; for instance, the US duty on raw tobacco is 350% and over 130% for peanuts.

In some cases, US and EU duties are different even on the same product. For example:

for cars:

EU duty on imports from the US is 10%
US duty on imports from the EU is only 2.5%
for train carriages:

the US imposes a 14% duty on imports
the EU charges only 1.7% on imports from the US.

PSD relies on an extended network of members, a network descending from the one of the communist party, and their ability to get their people to cast the vote in parliamentary and local elections is astounding. This isn't even the point, because they won the parliamentary majority ( this also means the right to propose the prime minister) on a promise to raise the salaries in the public sector ( which is huge and also inneficient because almost  everything is politic here, and they rely on their vote too)  by 25% in the first year, and a lot of other raises and tax reductions that seemed too good to be true, and it pretty much was because they had to loan a lot of money to do this, the inflation skyrocketed and they had to cut the public investments to about 50%. Basically everything is based on a bribery system so they could get the power and keep it long enough to amputate the justice system. And now they actually did it, by making the Ministery of Justice the sole player in the naming and the revoking of the chief prosecutors, thus bypassing the president and CSM( the Supreme Council of the Magistrates). This is the huge problem, because under the control of the politicians nobody will have the balls to start an investigation on someone from PSD.

It consistently elects all democratic senators, and almost all house members are democrats and the ones that aren't are vulnerable. At the state level democrats dominate the state too. 

So yes you are wrong and profoundly ignorant of American politics. The irony is that California leads the resistance against trump and trump actively tries to hurt California in retaliation . also trump dislikes the tech companies and tries to hurt them too. And the red base dislikes California because California is so blue and dislike the tech companies for what they perceive as liberal bias. 

So your response to trump his to target a state and a company that are doing the most against trump to help him punish them for what he perceives as slights against him? 

You are either in st. Petersburg or not very smart.

&gt; 
&gt; 

Shirts are necessary in northern climate, face coverings are not. 

&gt; Yeah, no. That's not true. That you don't want to interact with people covered in head to toe is your choice. You are still a person that can interact with the world if you are covered in head to toe

I'm genuinely curious - have you ever actually had a conversation with a woman covered from head to toe? Have you ever stopped and chatted to her, or seen her stop and chat with someone? Because that's what those mean, symbolically, culturally, it's clear outward sign of ownership of women by her husband and her place as his property. Men don't wear any unnecessary coverings and pre-pubescent girls don't either, it's for menstruating women and above who are barred from society and kept home in the women's sphere. 

Closest equivalence would be stage helpers in Japanese theater, they wore all black all across their bodies including on their face because they were meant to be ignored and the audience understood that social signal and ignored them.

Google some videos or interviews with women wearing it. Quick examples:

Sure, you can call them brainwashed - but how can we judge it?

It doesn't matter what **we** think about it. Only opinion of people wearing it does.

&gt; Or do you think Muslim men or any man should have the right to oppress their wives and daughters and keep them locked up in their home?

Of course not. Neither I think they should be able to force them to wear or not wear anything. 

Coercion - bad. Bans - bad. Freedom and choice - good.

Thing is, when woman does wear it on her own choice - and some of them do, especially **here in Europe** - she should be free to do it.

&gt; allow our society to be changed by these people

I think that such ban is more harmful to our civilization (supposed to be based on **freedom**), than presence of such women. They are a minority even among Muslim women in general, besides literally few areas in the world. 

&gt; oppression of women by Muslim men

Don't you see the hypocrisy here? How can we fight ""women being told by men what to wear"" by doing **exactly the same**?

&gt; as now, Muslim women are much more free.

You say it's a violation, the elected government says otherwise. They win. Our opinion is worth nothing until the elections or a referendum.

Good luck defending that in court. You can't violate anyone's honor by insulting words or actions (§267); truth isn't a defence when the statement was improperly abusive (§270). Assuming you manage to prove that the Church is indeed a safe-haven (if priests are getting convicted are they safe?) you'd be screwed for the formulation used.

3257,"&gt;I don't think it is up to the EU alone to forge a future relationship by itself, it is also up to the UK. 

Of course it is, it has to be bilateral, neither side can impose a relationship on the other.

&gt;And given that the UK's rhetoric since the vote has been that they don't want to stay in the EU in any shape or form.

The UK has said it wants to leave the EU, that has been really clear, and remarkably difficulty to communicate. Initially it did really seem that the EU expected the UK to aim to either not leave, or leave in name only.  The UK was pretty clear on the point that it intended to leave.

&gt;and given that the UK has repeatedly shown that it is not a trustworthy partner,

When has the UK shown itself to be untrustworthy? It has complied by the rules of the process, complied with its treaty obligations.. The UK has been a trustworthy partner in these negotiations and beyond. The notion that the EU can't trust the UK is at best spin and at worst an attempt to create a situation where the UK and EU can't get an agreement even if they both believe it is the right thing to do..

&gt;I think that the blame for the poor relations between the UK and the EU can be firmly laid at the UK's door.

That's partially true, in that the UK leaving offers literally no benefit to the EU under any circumstances, and only leaves the EU smaller, weaker and with less sway on the world stage, but leaving the EU is something that the treaties explicitly allow for too.

Note that the front would be much further back to begin with if the Soviets didnt seize eastern Poland in 1940, which they wouldnt if they followed the Doctrina Estrada. Same for the Baltics. The Baltics would still be independent. Same for the Caucasus countries with the oil fields that were vital to Soviet tanks and airforce. 

But my argument to begin with is that if the Russians never kept busy with other countries, they wouldnt have invaded Finland, the Baltics, havent been at war with Poland and the various independent declared states after WW1. 

Its unlikely that the nazis would still strike russia itself when countries like Poland, the Baltics, Ukraine was fully theirs to seize. The nazis prioritized the Ukrainian grain fields and Caucasus oil fields. If Russia didnt meddle with foreign countries they wouldnt have invaded places like Georgia and Armenia after ww1. They did.

So yeah if the Russians and Americans both would follow the Doctrina Estrada its very likely the nazis wouldnt be defeated by either in ww2. 

The Soviets wouldnt have eastern poland, large chunks of what we now consider Ukraine, the Baltics, the oil fields in the Caucasus.

3449,"Soviet deportations from Lithuania were a series of 35[1] mass deportations carried out in Lithuania, a country that was occupied as a constituent socialist republic of the Soviet Union, in 1941 and 1945–1952. At least 130,000 people, 70% of them women and children,[2] were forcibly transported to labor camps and other forced settlements in remote parts of the Soviet Union, particularly in the Irkutsk Oblast and Krasnoyarsk Krai. Among the deportees were about 4,500 Poles.[3] These deportations do not include Lithuanian partisans or political prisoners (approximately 150,000 people) deported to Gulags (prison camps).[4] Deportations of the civilians served a double purpose: repressing resistance to Sovietization policies in Lithuania and providing free labor in sparsely inhabited areas of the Soviet Union. Approximately 28,000 of Lithuanian deportees died in exile due to poor living conditions.

Soviet deportations from Estonia were a series of mass deportations by the Soviet Union of approximately 33,000 people from Estonia in 1941 and 1945–1951.[1]

The two largest waves of deportations occurred in June 1941 and March 1949 simultaneously in all three Baltic states (Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania). The deportations targeted various categories of anti-Soviet elements and ""enemies of the people"": nationalists (i.e. political elite, military officers, policemen of independent Estonia), bandits (i.e. Forest Brothers), kulaks, and others. There were deportations based on nationality (Germans in 1945 and Ingrian Finns in 1947–1950) and religion (Jehovah's Witnesses in 1951).[1] Estonians residing in the Leningrad Oblast had already been subjected to deportation since 1935.[2][3]

People were deported to remote areas of the Soviet Union, predominantly to Siberia and Kazakhstan[citation needed], by means of railroad cattle cars. Entire families, including children and the elderly, were deported without trial or prior announcement. Of March 1949 deportees, over 70% of people were women and children under the age of 16.[4]

The Estonian Internal Security Service has brought to justice several past organizars of these events.[5] The deportations have been repeatedly declared to constitute a crime against humanity by the Parliament of Estonia[6] and also acknowledged to be so by the European Court of Human Rights.[7]

&gt;If their intention was really to catch the ""Russian connection"" then that'd have been a really stupid move because it might just as likely have resulted in warning the Russians, making them wack the contact to erase any traces back to them. 

So it's somehow less suspicious to be chill about a journalist they are harboring being murdered in cold blood?

&gt;Right now there's literally nothing that connects this to Russia except for Ukraine claiming so, but they just lost a ton of their credibility with the way the handled this, completely needless, operation. And it was needless, you don't see this happen anywhere else because there are other ways for going about this without faking peoples death and making nasty accusations on the public world stage.

How was it needless? There was a russian operative ordering hits on people they harbor. Were they supposed to sit back and let them hire a different hitman?

&gt;But with current sentiments not many people care, blame Russia and everybody goes ""Of course Russia is evil!"". If you throw enough dirt at somebody some of it will surely stick.

&gt; My issue with how you explain the serial killer, is that you seem to imply that he cares about other people or a continuity between himself and others. I don't see why he has to accept that because he thinks killing him is wrong, it also means killing others is wrong. There is a clear distinction between himself and others. He finds people killing him wrong, but he doesn't find killing others wrong for the sake of them being another person. Why does morality extend to every person equally? This seems to be based on an assumption of equality, where the serial killer might not subscribe to. 


That's indeed a key point: why is the only just/fair thing to do, to extend the morality that I want for myself, to all other human beings? (and not deny other people the rights that I have?)

John Rawls gives us the answer with his theory of Original Position: imagine you have the power to create a society you think to be as just/fair/moral. But, you can only set the wide lines of the rules, and don't know your own position in that society, nor the exact details of it, until after it is created.

You thus might choose to make a society where religion dominates, but then it is uncertain that specifically your religion is chosen to dominate. 

You might choose a society where one violent dictator rules the country, but you might just as well become one of the guys who is sent to the Gulag.

The only way for you to create a society in which you are certain that your own moral rights are respected, is to create a system which respects each individuals universal moral rights (right to bodily integrity, freedom of harm, freedom of speech and thought, ...).

John Rawls himself does say his statements are political, not metaphysical. But that is where my opinion that truth is based in reality comes in: the way the world works, is the only way it works, and we can only base our claims about it on what we see and experience.

This is (like I said in another reaction), a very anthropocentric/humanitarian point of view, but I don't see that as an insult.

And from that point of view, following the above thought process, it is clear to me that morality is objective.",,/r/europe/comments/8n76fy/how_western_europeans_respond_to_the_statement/dzv76xu/,kwestievan,1527745134

3667,"&gt; They would lose a lot of their (illegitimate) power

Nothing illegitimate about any of it. If the larger countries no longer agree with the founding principles of the EU, they are free to invoke Article 50 any time they please and found their own EUv2 with blackjack and hookers.

&gt; but every EU member benefits immensely from free borders and free trade so they wouldn't dare to risk membership.

This tactic of strong-arming smaller countries by means of economic pressure is *exactly* what degressive proportionality is supposed to prevent, and so far it has done a mighty fine job.

&gt; I disagree with the notion that returning to more democratic representation would mean the EU would have to reform into a single republic while abolishing sovereignty. I don't see how one begets the other. What is your reasoning for that claim?

Stop confusing democracy with direct representation. Democracy is about the rule of the people and ideally doesn't involve *any* kind of representation. And democracy has nothing, absolutely *nothing* to do with international relations or international law.

As to your question, I honestly don't understand why you think that marginalizing the voices of smaller countries would *not* impede on their sovereignty. Perhaps this will become clearer if you consider for a moment India (a democratic country) joining the EU. In this entirely fictional case, your so-called ""democratic"" representation would immediately result in the marginalisation of all other countries and effectively reduce the European Parliament to insignificance. The real politics would happen in India.

And that is why degressive proportionalism is a thing, and why the EU is a union of nations rather than a union of men, where not every man may get his voice heard, but every nation does.

&gt; That's not the same thing because elected politicians represent everyone of their citizens, not just those who voted for them. A german representative represents 80 Million people. There is no reason to cut German representation in half.

That's a nice ideal that unfortunately doesn't hold up to reality, where most representatives aren't accountable to anyone and ultimately only represent themselves and whoever is funding them.",Basel-Stadt (Switzerland),/r/europe/comments/8n9i8p/representation_balance_in_the_2019_european/dzv7mmu/,And_G,1527745856

3682,"&gt; “At the base of the Estonian economy lies the rational Scandinavian mentality of the people, a Protestant work ethic, and one of the lowest levels of corruption in the world … And although in the Baltic there is not even one tenth of one percent of the natural wealth which exists in Russia, these countries live and are developing better and more rapidly than Russia.

 

&gt; “All these years the countries of the Baltic are making up for lost time, and this is clear from their roads, their rates of pay, and their healthcare. The agricultural sector is developing, new production is coming online even though they have neither gas, nor oil, nor diamonds, nor anything.”

 

&gt; “If the Baltic countries had not been occupied in 1940 by the Russians, their average pay would be today twice as high as it is. It is generally considered that the level of 2000 euros make a state flourishing. Finland is at that level, a country which is today one of the richest in the world and which defended itself from Soviet occupation by a war in 1939-1940.

 

&gt; “As a result of occupation and colonization, in 1991, 48 percent of the population of Latvia, 39 percent of the population of Estonia, and 15 percent of the population of Lithuania consisted of Russian colonists. Resistance to Russian occupation lasted in Lithuania until 1954, a resistance that was crushed only by two entire divisions of the USSR regular forces. As a result, about 40,000 people died.

 

&gt; “After the recovery of independence in 1991, the small Baltic countries, burdened down by the colossal ballast of Russian colonists, were able successfully to integrate themselves into the European community. The Russian Federation [in contrast] is proceeding along its own ‘special path.’

 

&gt; “According to the corruption indices compiled by Transparency International, Russia is among the 50 most corrupt countries of the world. Nevertheless, Russian propaganda continues to denigrate the Balts, spreading false information about them [regarding corruption where they are among the least in the world as well as on other issues].

 

&gt; “Russians especially love to talk about the EU aide which the Baltic countries receive and which is used as intended rather than going into someone’s pocket as this would be customary in the countries of the CIS.

 

&gt; “It is also curious that many of the Russians living today in the Baltic countries up to now do not trouble themselves to learn the state language of their country and do not feel any gratitude to these countries.

 

&gt; “They only complain about the difficult life and poor state of the powers that be, not suspecting for a minute that the problem lies within themselves.

That's hardly enough to take over the continent and it also makes the ridiculous assumption that all children of Muslims will become Muslims themselves. Then there is also the question of how religious they'll be in a few decades. I know very few Muslims myself but the ones I have met are Muslims in name only.

I don't care what fantasy your parents tell you as long as you forget it soon enough and focus on real life.

The European Parliament takes both into account. You're only considering the first, because in your mind, a country is no more than the sum of its citizens. And that is a naïve and dangerous way of looking at things.

Had the ECSC been operating on your principles, BeNeLux would never have been part of it, and no other small countries would ever have joined. Without BeNeLux, France's membership would have been rather questionable as well, considering the history with Germany and Italy. Degressive proportionality is the very reason the EU came into existence, and protecting the sovereignty of its smaller members has been a core principle of the EU since its inception. (Or rather, even earlier than that.)

Now, no one says you can't overthrow the principles an entity was founded on. But you need to be aware that in this case, doing so would mean to turn the EU from a federation of nations into a federal republic, similar to the US. And many of the smaller countries would not be on board with that *at all*.

FDR was going to get the US into that war, it was absolutely vital to US strategic interests that Nazi Germany not control Europe and perhaps the Middle East and North Africa.

In 1917 the US declared war on Germany first, it certainly wouldnt be unthinkable the US would have done that again if Germany hadn't declared war on its own.  Germany was Japan's ally and had similar goals of conquest, its not difficult to imagine with the anger Americans felt they'd go along with fighting Germany too.  For example, after 9/11 we went to Afghanistan and 18 months later we invaded Iraq.  All it took for most Americans to support the Iraq War was flimsy intelligence there was a link and that Iraq was a threat.  The anger and desire to fight were running strong, we didn't much reason to go to war.

Its also worth noting that the US declaration in 1941 came only hours after Germany's, so while I haven't researched it out, I think its safe to say we were already set on that course after Pearl Harbor.",,/r/europe/comments/8n89nx/the_us_should_move_troops_from_germany_to_poland/dzv3usw/,MeatsimN64,1527740284

&gt; It's not like Russia has a lot of international credibility when it comes to nefarious murders right now.

Which sure has some truth to it, but this is just as bad and even part of the reason why these generalizations exist. Ukraine even faked pictures of the corpse and publicly accused Russia of being responsible, for a murder that didn't happen, while this operation was going on.

If their intention was really to catch the ""Russian connection"" then that'd have been a really stupid move because it might just as likely have resulted in warning the Russians, making them wack the contact to erase any traces back to them.

Right now there's literally nothing that connects this to Russia except for Ukraine claiming so, but they just lost a ton of their credibility with the way the handled this, completely needless, operation. And it was needless, you don't see this happen anywhere else because there are other ways for going about this without faking peoples death and making nasty accusations on the public world stage.

But with current sentiments not many people care, blame Russia and everybody goes ""Of course Russia is evil!"". If you throw enough dirt at somebody some of it will surely stick.",,/r/europe/comments/8n925c/murdered_russia_journalist_arkady_babchenko_turns/dzv3xwt/,Nethlem,1527740393
3797,"&gt;And how is that? Because overall, the EU is much more resilient against external shocks than the US.

That doesn't make any sense.  The US recovered significantly faster than Europe from the 2008 financial crisis.  In fact, Europe is still recovering.  

&gt;You do indeed have a significantly higher disposable income. But thanks to your whopping levels of inequality, that figure is heavily skewed towards the top, whereas in the EU, disposable household incomes are dispersed much more broadly. And thanks to your mind-boggling amount of debt, the US is the world's biggest debtor while the world's biggest creditors are within the EU. 

I'm afraid it is you who does not understand: the US provides the world's reserve currency and agreed to patrol the world's trade lanes and agreed to run trade deficits in order to combat communism.  Those policies, and those institutions, have continued into this decade but are now beginning to become obsolete.

&gt;But thanks to your whopping levels of inequality, that figure is heavily skewed towards the top

The US is only marginally more unequal than Europe.  Median gdp per capita in the US is significantly higher than Germany as well, and that excludes extreme outliers.  

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(PPP)_per_capita

&gt;Consumer spending in Germany, for instance, can go way up (and has done so in recent quarters), because our net assets allow for quite some drawing on our reserves, while US consumers have been chronically over-consuming for decades now.

What does this even mean?  You spew this nonsense and provide zero sources and act like you're having a discussion.  Are you trying to say that the US market is over saturated? What is your evidence to support that claim?

&gt;Americans spend even more than what they've got, while Europeans up until now were mainly busy saving (at least in Northern and Western Europe, which have the highest saving rates besides Japan).

Americans have been emptying savings accounts and buying stocks because interest rates were at.. ZERO %, meanwhile the stock market doubled and tripled.

&gt;Europeans up until now were mainly busy saving

Really?  Doesn't look like the facts support your statement.

https://data.oecd.org/hha/household-debt.htm

&gt;And then there's still things like health care (Americans have to spend way more than Europeans on it, and it's coming out of their disposable income)

A good attempt, but the data is adjusted for that so sorry to burst your bubble there.

&gt;or the fact that you're way behind on public education

Your ignorance is astounding, here's an article written by an Iranian immigrant to Sweden:

3. I have read they were permanently abolished 

&gt;The Prime Minister at the time, Disraeli, had once been a staunch upholder of the Corn Laws and had predicted ruin for agriculture if they were repealed.[\[38\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corn_Laws#cite_note-39)[\[39\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corn_Laws#cite_note-40) However, unlike most other European governments, his government did not revive tariffs on imported cereals to save their farms and farmers.[\[40\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corn_Laws#cite_note-Ensor,_p._54-41) Despite calls from landowners to reintroduce the Corn Laws, Disraeli responded by saying that the issue was settled and that protection was impracticable.[\[41\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corn_Laws#cite_note-42) Ensor claimed that the difference between Britain and the Continent was due to the latter having conscription; rural men were thought to be the best suited as soldiers. But for Britain, with no conscript army, this did not apply.[\[40\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corn_Laws#cite_note-Ensor,_p._54-41) He also claimed that Britain staked its future on continuing to be ""the workshop of the world,"" as the leading manufacturing nation.[\[36\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corn_Laws#cite_note-Ensor,_p._118-37) [Robert Blake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Blake,_Baron_Blake) claimed that Disraeli was dissuaded from reviving protection due to the urban working class enjoying cheap imported food at a time of industrial depression and rising unemployment. Enfranchised by Disraeli in 1867, working men's votes were crucial in a general election and he did not want to antagonise them.[\[42\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corn_Laws#cite_note-43)

3900,"Okay but thats sort of like, how everything works now, you literally cant produce everything yourself if you want to, you can shut off half of every car, railcar, computer part, raw steel or phone importat there is through tariffs, its not like you would magically start producing it all on your own to make up for it? If you want to raise the prices on every imported good by 5 or 30 %, or maybe just some goods, I guess you have a technical right (morally) even if not according to WTO. 


You know I just read a history course at university, writing my last essay today, the most interesting chapters were revolving the 16th-18th centuries, they had a curiously similar outdated economical belief: its called mercantilism, which is basically screaming ""exporting is good, importing is bad, trade deficits are bad"", so if your entire economical opinion is based on a 17th century european idealism, then go for it, if you think you can do it all on your own, shut down your country like north korea, or like japan did (before the US knocked on its door with gunboats and forced them to open the country). 


You know, in the end, money is just money, if you want to sell 50 cows for 10 papers that say you have imaginary money, thats great, if you think you can export 50 % more than you import, then youre going to eventually run out of things to export and end up with a bunch of money instead, for better or for worse. This is just a ludicrous simplification to give you an idea, and might not represent actual imported goods or exported goods (since importing X and Y and turning it into Z might make Z worth more, of course). That said, ironically steel is a really basic good, and importing steel to build your own advanced goods is what could actually be quite profitable if the foreign steel is cheaper than the native steel you can produce.

They went to Turkey. Two pipes, down from four, Gazprom pays for the risky and expensive marine construction, Turkey owns land infrastructure. Massive discounts on gas deliveries from all sources.

The EU is not a state, but it still operates on democratic principles.


Article 2 of the treaty of Maastricht states:

""The Union is founded on the values of respect for human dignity, freedom, **democracy**, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights.

The EU is not a federation, it's a supranational organization.

3996,"&gt;Over the weekend, president Sergio Mattarella rejected academic Paolo Savona to become a member of the new Italian government, reportedly because of his eurosceptic views.

&gt;So how radical is Savona?

&gt;According to Italy's president, dangerously so.

&gt;""The uncertainty about our position in the euro has alarmed Italian and foreign investors who have invested in our bonds and companies,"" the president said according to agency Ansa.

&gt;The concerns seem to revolve around Savona's eurosceptic views

&gt;The 81-year old would-be finance chief wrote that ""we need to prepare a plan B to get out of the euro if necessary ... the other alternative is to end up like Greece.""

&gt;But is that really such a radical position to take?

&gt;During the height of the euro crisis in 2012, national governments of EU countries were often asked whether a plan B existed in case the common currency collapsed.

&gt;It was always denied, but some years later it emerged that at least two countries had elaborated plan Bs.

&gt;Ironically, these were two of the most hawkish euro countries: the Netherlands and Germany.

So it was just a bullshit excuse.

It looks like Mattarella was instructed by the EU to overturn the result of the Italian elections, and he spent a lot of time casting around for an excuse to do it, and this was all he could come up with.",,/r/europe/comments/8ndchg/how_radical_is_italys_savona_really/dzuo75l/,alyssas,1527723548

4052,"&gt;Regardless of that, it’s their club and they can set whatever rules they want. We had a voice in said rule making, but decided to abandon it. The consequences are ours to bare.

That's a far better argument, and it's entirely valid. If the EU want to tell us to go stuff it then that's entirely up to the EU and its current member set. However if it does, it'll be just as open to criticism of self harm as the UK in the context of leaving the EU in the first place.  The EU and UK can either forge a sensible relationship going forward that works for both, or the UK and EU can try to cause issues for each other, the latter is far less desirable than the former.  

&gt;Yeah the EU could be nicer, but we started out with the hateful rhetoric and they don’t have to go out of their way to satisfy us. It sucks, but it’s a direct result of our actions.

I suppose the biggest argument there is the point that the EU has absolutely nothing to gain by the UK leaving, under all circumstances, the EU loses. However much like the UK, the EU can mitigate some of the negatives if it wants, it doesn't have to, but if doesn't it's also reasonable to suggest that maybe the EU isn't acting in the interests of its members, but instead out of an ideological position that likely isn't quite shared by a lot of them.

4132,"&gt;The US is intrested in a strong Europe, Europe and the US are after all allies.

Yeah but that only goes so far. On trade, for example, the US and EU have some big disagreements. If the EU were a single country then the EU would have a lot more power to go against the US on trade. Or like the French proposal to tax digital companies based on revenue. From the US perspective that looks obviously targeted at big US tech firms like Google, Facebook, etc... If the EU were a single country then the EU might implement such a tax. 

I'm not saying the US has a desire to actively undermine the EU. I'm just saying that the US doesn't think of itself as having relations with ""Europe"" or ""the EU"". When the US thinks of its foreign relations, it thinks of its relations with individual EU member states.

4135,"&gt; Apologies but I feel like you're treating this less than rationally. It seems your ideas conception of the Golden rule itself (not to mention the major assumption you're taking) is very Eurocentric and limited soon not sure how you can advocate for objectivity.
&gt; 

The Golden Rule has been invented in many forms in most civilizations. That many societies don't take them to the logical end-form, nor apply it universally, is not its fault, but the fault of those societies. The Western world has made mistakes against this for 1000s of years (and still makes some against it). Therefore, I don't see it as Eurocentric at all.

In my view, the thought process is completely rational if you regard humans as the object as well as the subject of morality. WE create morality FOR and ABOUT ourselves. Since all rational humans agree, that things being done towards them that they don't want, as being morally wrong, you have a clear universal objective standard for morality (the golden rule, expressed correctly).



&gt; In the exploitation paradox the sweatshop workers do have the choice of working for less at another job but go to the factory because it's the highest paying in their area.
&gt; 

Well, if these people have real alternatives to survive, and barring very unsafe unhealthy exploitative circumstances, I have no objections against cheap labor in developing countries. 

&gt; And if you are saying you're ok with temporary exploitation, maybe you never cared for human dignity and only wanted to reify the definition of morality to be in line with what you think?
&gt; 

I am a realist: capitalistic interventions in developing countries have lifted billions of people out of poverty (look at China). Which doesn't mean I agree with 9 year olds handling cyanide without protective gear in underground gold mines. They at least should get some goggles.


&gt; Killing gay people for their sexuality is wrong
&gt; 
&gt; While I'm inclined to agree, there is no 'objective' moral weight to this. War and killing is one of the most human things and what one people see as innocent others see as guilty. This is why you cant just say 'golden rule' and be done because different cultures give rise to different interpretations that can all be 'valid'.
&gt; 

Sometimes reality is messy, definitely in cases of chaos, with war as an extreme form.

But that is very far away from claiming the Holocaust is not a downright abomination.


&gt; You claim to put human well being at the forefront but sometimes what we want isn't what we need and it may not be the right thing.
&gt; 

I agree. Some 12 year old might ""want"" to have sex with his 32 year old French teacher. Doesn't make it right, because he can not see all the consequences of this action. And in other cases people do not have a real freedom to choose, so they convince themselves they ""want"" this (eg abused woman running back to their husbands because she has no idea how to be independent because he kept her sheltered)


&gt; Take that person and force him to believe in another god
&gt; 
&gt; Colonists did that. Add communists to that. Add almost any authoritarian regime as well. Add democracies as well because every society has views the population doesn't tolerate to the extent that they will be willing to breach another's rights to stop that view.
&gt; 

And all of those actions were evil.

You should tolerate all point of views, as long as these views adhere to the objective moral standards and are tolerant themselves to other points of view.



&gt; In the case of apostasy it would be a harmful view leading people to evil and injustice (and hellfire) and so spreading it must not be allowed in that moral framework.
&gt; 

No it doesn't. It is really not based in any fact to claim people who believe in a different god (or not at all) are prone to evil and injustice.



&gt; As for consent, that's an extremely slippery slope as to who can consent. Your conditions for consent are not very easy to pin down and not necessarily age-limited. Of course that might seem hard to stomach but the reality is much messier. Also consider how the age for humans marrying (and yes, sex) have often been lower throughout history and tend to vary with the human lifespan in that era. 

Consent is pretty clear cut. I agree it is harder to know who is able to consent (14?16?18? Why not 20?   No alcohol? 1 beer? 5 white wines? 2 bottles of Wodka?) So we make laws to the best of our abilities. I will not shame Germany for putting the age of consent at 14, nor Turkey for putting it at 18. But a 7 year old? No, that's very clear cut.


&gt; Our aversion to what we call pedophilia is very much a cultural phenomena if we only emotionally look at age which doesn't necessarily tell us enough.
&gt;

Fuck no.

 
&gt; What about bestiality? What animals could actually consent? Or we genetically engineered ones that could? I mean what even is a human.

Animals can't consent. But I acknowledge this is where my own ethics get murky: I believe eating animals is not morally wrong, because I don't place them at the same level as humans. I do believe we should not make them suffer unnecessarily (torture, unneeded animal testing, unsedated slaughter, battery chicken farms, fucking a rabbit up the ass, ...).

But I do see that a hindu might find it abhorrent that I kill animals to eat, while there are viable vegetarian alternative diets available.

Perhaps there is some truth to hedonistic morality, but it is also possible that I am being inconsistent rationally for my own selfish reasons (I love meat).

Hopefully artificial meat comes soon and takes that qualm away.

4164,"That's outdated information, I'm afraid. 

In January 1943, Nazi Germany spent 39 million Reichsmark on AA guns and ammunition used in the defense of German cities, compared to 93 million on all other types of guns, vehicles and ammunition combined (including tanks, aircraft, ships, etc.).

Imagine if Nazi Germany had been able to spend a significant portion of these 39 million on planes, tanks and submarines instead.

There is a huge number of misconceptions about the economy and organization of Nazi Germany. I would strongly suggest reading Adam Tooze's seminal work [""The Wages of Destruction""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wages_of_Destruction), which does away with significant number of these. It's a very accessible book, but nonetheless incredibly precise and detailed.

4208,"Well indeed there is a lot of nuance here.

Saying that the continuity is a 19th century reconstruction is, at least in part, true: 19th century nationalism - a fairly new concept - did indeed call for a re-reading if history focusing on the timeless existence of a Nation. And the modern Greek state is a child of this nationalism. Also important to remember is that the great powers that contributed to it's existence did not want a recreation of the ""Byzantine"" empire, with its views on Constantinople and it's straits, as well as Asia minor. Finally, Greek Peasants would see themselves as locals, Christians and Romans. The Greek identity was,for the most part,lost to them.

However, it is mostly the eduxated elites that bother  with such questions. Greek inheritance was reclaimed (after being to a certain extent rejected as pagan) as the ""Byzantine"" empire shrunk to mostly encompass Greek people. This much is clear in scholarly debate, beginning around the 9th century. Greek texts - philosophy and all - were not only kept by monasteries and universities, but alsi warmly debated. Anna Komnene shaped her Alexiad after the Odyssey. Plethon the plenty was a preeminent Plato influenced philosopher and even argued for a return to paganism. Finally, Constantine palaiologos, in his last call to arms during the fall of Constantinople, called for his men to fight like their Greek and Roman ancestors.

During the Ottoman times, the Greek references remained very present amongst the ""Romioi"". Folk tales speak of Alexander the great. Folk art included ancient motifs. There was great talk of ""το γένος"", literally (at least etymologically) the nation. 

All this is, of course, highly debatable. But rejecting the continuity wholepiece is ignoring a few important aspects of Greek history. ",Greece,/r/europe/comments/8n76fy/how_western_europeans_respond_to_the_statement/dztz561/,AllAlongTheParthenon,1527700703

4256,"There is no such thing as superior or inferior culture but economics, politics, technology, economic system and religion fundamentalism, etc. 

I don't think slavery is about culture but about technology and economic systems. The slave became out of fashion once the economic system became more dependent of consumption. The more people purchase things the stronger the capitalism. On the other hand, despite the end of slavery in industrial nations, work itself are largely privatized (I recommend the book ""The problem with work"" by Kathi Weeks).

The same with child marriage. Once nations needed more instructed people to join the more specialized and wide variate industries, women studding, working, purchasing, are more relevant now than before.

Human sacrifice comes out of fashion once science and better life quality among people rises.

In other worlds, culture are just context.

Now, if you really what establish that there is superior and inferior culture. I believe the native american culture are much superior than European culture. The native Americans didn't depend on others people for individual survivor. From early childhood they know how to survive alone, they know how to build their homes, how to find and grow food, how to find and make medicines, how to identify poisonous animals and plants, how to navigate using the stars, all on their own without degradation of the nature, without degadation of their body. Not dependable of some one else work, goods or wealth to survive. The European culture is based on individuals heavily dependable and consequently exploited by each other.

The President of the Commission is chosen by the European council, not by the European Parliament. The MEPs only vote to confirm him. Last elections, all the parties pledged to refuse any candidate that wasn't the head of the leading party, so that effectively, it came down to being directly elected through the elections of the parliament.

4280,"Some cultures have developed more successful societies than others.

However, it's only one piece of the puzzle. Consider, for instance, what animals were viable for domestication on the Eurasian continent compared to the American one. 

Our ancestors had the precursors to cows, pigs, horses (!!), sheep... Native American societies had... llamas? Good luck domesticating bisons.  

Imagine European societies without horses ever existing. Pre-Colonial societies in the Americas had very few domesticated animals simply because of their geography and this had a major impact on their development and thus their success. 

As for today, I think it's important to separate culture from ethnicity. You cannot change your ethnicity, but as an individual in ever more globalized societies you can denounce the problematic parts of your culture, assuming you're self-aware enough to perceive them. 

Saying a culture is inferior to another is not racist, unless you believe that a persons' ethnicity is so intrinsically linked to their culture that they cannot be separated.

The general in charge decided the theory was sound but they just needed to do more. To me that sounds like idiocy and nothing more than a desire to get revenge, however like I've said I have 70 years of peace time to sit on my high horse and say that, I've not seen my friends get blown up, family have to evacuate their homes, trembling in the underground system, etc. Others have pointed out in the thread that it DID have an effect but again sources seem to vary heavily, and others saying Dresden did have factories, and strategic value.

Objective morality, means that it is universal.

Let's stick to the pedophilia example. If you take a pedophile who forced a 7 year old to suck his dick, and force himself to suck a dick he doesn't want to suck, he would claim it to be ""wrong/bad/evil"". The pedophile agrees, that him having to perform sexual acts he doesn't consent to, is not right. That he doesn't transfer that morality to his victim, is irrelevant.

Everyone in the world agrees that, for themselves, being forced to suck dicks they don't want to suck, is bad/wrong/evil. It is universal. So, that makes forcing sexual acts upon someone without consent objectively wrong.

What we are talking about here, is the difference between moral relativism (based on some nihilistic view of the world I do not agree with), moral absolutism (disagree with it as well, as I have never seen or felt proof for it), and moral realism (which, I guess you already knew, I do believe in).",,/r/europe/comments/8n76fy/how_western_europeans_respond_to_the_statement/dztjdcg/,kwestievan,1527686587

&gt;Being a good running country doesnt give you a great culture.


I think the problem here is that we don't understand the word ""culture"" in a same way. Which, btw, isn't uncommon at all, it _is_ a very, very broad term and everyone seems to have their own conception of what it means. I personally absolutely think that ""culture"", especially in this context, refers to social policies and how the country is governed too, and covers the approach to healthcare, education, government etc. Norway has objectively speaking the [highest living standard in this world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_inequality-adjusted_HDI). Every single part of their society works in a way that aims to respect human rights and dignity, and to ensure a life of good quality and happiness based on a humane, scientific approach. So yeah, I absolutely think that is pretty close to perfection. Their culture has produced a country that respect equality and human rights in every aspect, and is honest, stable, safe and wealthy.


So in other words I very much doubt those Norwegians answering in this thought ""oh, I bet they're asking if Norwegian food and art is superior"". However I do find your attempt to minimize Norwegian arts, architecture and festivities lame (ofc everything you wrote about the Netherlands is true though, but that doesn't prove your point), because they have done pretty on that department too considering their size, and I absolutely think as a foreigner there is a lot to see and enjoy (for example their national day can be a lovely experience).


&gt;EDIT: Seems like i angered some people. Im not disrespecting the Norwegian state. Norway is one of the best countries in the world in many aspects. Culture is just not one of them in my opinion. Being rich and succesfull = not guarenteed great and unique culture. There are poor countries that are in shambles with a incredibly unique culture; Iraq and Syria being 2 examples.


I'm not angry, obviously I am a bit biased towards other Nordic countries, but I just genuinely disagreed with your view which seems to be based on a very superficial knowledge and misconceptions, starting with mentioning the oil. Having oil doesn't guarantee the country's overall well being or success. There are countries that  have a lot of natural resources but aren't wealthy, and there are countries with oil money that have done (IMO) a terrible job spending it. Norway will not collapse when the black gold loses its appeal. They have been very smart with the profit, using it to benefit everyone. That is money very well spent.

4542,"&gt;It wasn’t at all and if the allies had been honest to themselves, they would have to admit it was a war crime.

A war crime is something banned by the rules of war. The rules at the time banned the bombardment of undefended towns, but not defended ones, or towns containing military installations.

&gt;The most damning thing is the ineffectiveness of the whole campaign. Such vast resources were allocated to the bombing of civilians for very little effect.

The Germans actually spent more of their resources defending against bombing than the allies spent on bombing them, so even if the bombs themselves had no effect, the campaign would still have been an advantage. But the campaign was effective. When the RAF greatly intensified bombing in the summer of 1943 it brought the German armaments miracle to a halt. German production had been growing at 5.5&amp;#37; a month, from May 1943 \- February 1944 military production didn't grow at all. It was only the respite caused by diverting the bombers to counter the V weapons sites, and to support the invasion of France, that allowed German production to recover. And when the bombers switched back to Germany in September 1944, production again collapsed.

The truth is that bombing was devastating to the German war effort, but only once the scale was increased from mid 1943.

&gt;It’s quite interesting to listen to what Speer had to say right after the war and how he basically wondered why the allies were so downright stupid when it came to picking targets.

Speer probably knew more about the effects of bombing than almost anyone, but he had little idea about actually conducting a bombing campaign. Targets were hard to hit. Speer might have felt that attacks on certain small targets would have been more devastating, but the reality is bombing was very inaccurate. Even on a large oil refinery target covering more than a square mile, the RAF managed less than 16&amp;#37; of bombs within the plant fence, the USAAF less than 10&amp;#37;.

The Luftwaffe developed area bombing techniques in the Blitz because it was much easier to hit cities than factories. The RAF learnt from that and so, eventually, did the USAAF.

4569,"&gt;This is not bieng racist or xenophobic, it only means you can see with your eyes the kind of shit that goes on in your planet.

But you are NOT seeing it with your own eyes. You are seeing it through media. You are seeing it through your own pre-existing thought patterns. You are seeing it through years of conditioning by your own culture and society. 

In order to see it with your own eyes, you must actually visit some cannibal culture in Papua New Guinea and see the way they live and what kind of people they are. And not even that allows you to see inside their language and their worldview. 

It's funny how you claim you see it with your own eyes, but at the same time you call a modern Western society a place with real freedom? That is something you should see with your own eyes since it's right in front of you... In reality, we are way LESS free than the cannibal cultures living the jungles. Do you really think they must ask a permission to build a home? Do you really think they need to visit a bank and take a loan if they want to settle on some land? Do you really think they must drive a big metal box through a predetermined path in order to make a living or keep the society going? Do you really think they have to pay taxes and obey 2500 pages worth of rules and restrictions? Do you really think they must waste their time and energy on irrelevancies because 10 years of formal education says so? Do you really think they must acquire irrelevant and pointless stuff because a piece of propaganda tells them to? Do you really think they must wait a red light to turn green in order to walk from point A to point B? 

We must, and that's why we are not free. We live in a totalitarian system stretching across the planet. Cash flows determine how free we can be, and the more you submit to the ideology, the more you can make cash. Just like loyal Nazis who were part of the Nazi party and supported the ideology. They had it better than someone who opposed it. The only real difference is that while your typical totalitarian ideologies are collectivist, our totalitarianism is individualistic to extent it's already threatening the existence of our own society, culture and community... It's personalized to fit every individual's irrational fears and desires in order to make them serve the system instead of serving themselves and their people. It's evolving web of things that create profit for their shareholders, and the most profitable things are things that stimulate the dopamine receptors of people by rewarding them for nothing. This kind of mindless hedonism is driving us into a state that is a SHADOW of what human individual and its society COULD be.

The allies did not want to hurt the civilians, they (well, the British and Americans that is) were remarkably restrained against German citizens (unlike the Russians or the Nazis against the citizens of the countries they invaded). But they were dealing with the Nazi war machine and had to make some very, very difficult decisions to hasten the ending of the war. The Nazi machine was the essence of evil on this earth.

4621,"You are really bad at this. Or you haven't heard that the development funds are based on the EU average and with the withdrawal of the UK? the average must have increased. 

But I cannot overlook that you have completely missed the part where it discussed that **the distribution criteria had been adjusted.** The  formula had been altered by introducing additional criteria that shifts funds from Eastern European states to the southern states. 

\&gt;Traditionally it used a region's GDP per capita figure to reflect its  prosperity. Now that criterion is reduced from 86 percent to 81 percent  and the commission added other criteria, **such as youth unemployment**, ** climat**e, low education levels,** and the reception and integration of  migrants**.

You might say that ""oh no, this has nothing to do with the rule of law and migration clashes this is a purely rational decision to maximise the overall GDP"" **which is wrong**.  The EU budget is a not a mathematical problem, it is a political process.  We don't know what happened exactly, but we can be certain in the following: 

* the Southern Europeans presented their case for introducing the new criteria, 
* the Eastern Europeans presented their case for maintaining the old criteria.
* There were negotiations, deals were being made and at the end, the Eastern Europeans **lost**.  The Eastern Europeans have failed to keep the PowerPlayers like Germany in their favour  That much is **factual**.

Now you might say that it has nothing to do with the German [attempts to block EU](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-eu-cohesion-funds/cut-funds-to-eu-members-that-violate-rule-of-law-german-proposal-idUSKBN18Q28R?il=0) funds to these countries, for all the known reasons but that would be a naive thing to do. 

Changing the rules to get a favourable outcome is one of the olderst trick in the book. I implore you not to take anything at face value.

**Disclaimer**:I am a Hungarian but I agree that the high youth unemployment in southern Italy, Greece, Spain and Portugal is a much more pressing issue than supporting Eastern Europe. also, Orban is running a Putinesque oligarchic regime  and my people's minds and souls are being poisoned by a toxic cloud of xenophobic government propaganda.

Geographic location of poor populations has nothing to do with choice, unless you count as choice the necessity of living where you can afford it.

What I find odd with discussions about integration is that it's the only field of public policy where people assume that the government is perfect and did everything perfectly for these populations to integrate, implying that failure to integrate must be a choice by the immigrant and not the result of failed public policies.

4682,"&gt;The torrent of news stories about cyberattacks and data breaches never seems to slow, but law-enforcement agencies have tallied some significant victories against online criminals. Websites spewing Islamic State propaganda have been sidelined, thanks to joint efforts by American and European authorities. So have sites on the “dark web” selling illegal drugs, hacking for hire, and other unsavory items and services.

&gt;Unfortunately, this good work will now be significantly hindered as the European Union begins to enforce its General Data Protection Regulation. As written, the GDPR will restrict the types of data that companies can share—even, perhaps inadvertently, with law enforcement.

&gt;The GDPR is intended to safeguard EU residents’ privacy online. To that end, it effectively puts a wide range of “personal data” under cryptographic lock and key. The fundamental problem is that the regulation explicitly covers the kinds of information critical to law enforcement, such as data that could help investigators track down hackers and the devices they use to cause mayhem online.

&gt;Take something as basic as the name, physical address and other contact information of the owner for a given website or domain name. Right now those details generally are publicly available in what is called the Whois database, which is maintained by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, or Icann. Police rely on these kinds of innocuous facts as they work to shut down dangerous websites and find people who host or launch malware.

&gt;But the GDPR is being interpreted such that Whois data may not be shared without the owner’s consent. As you’d imagine, hackers will decline the opportunity to release data that links them to their crimes. As WSJ Pro Cybersecurity reported May 10: “The problem only surfaced relatively recently as domain name registrars took legal advice about . . . whether sharing the WHOIS data constituted a breach of GDPR. While an exemption would rectify the situation, experts are not confident of a last minute fix.”

&gt;But unless something is done, police will be robbed of ready access to vital data, drastically impeding their efforts to identify and shut down illicit activity. Icann has proposed allowing law-enforcement officials to regain access to the information after they go through a lengthy accreditation program. But even that unwieldy plan is facing objections, including criticism from EU regulators that it would inadequately protect data guarded by the GDPR. As a result, the Whois database is likely to go dark for some time.

&gt;Though the GDPR is a product of the European Union, it was deliberately written to cover companies all around the globe. In short, the regulation applies to any business that has a physical presence in the EU or that maintains small morsels of information about EU residents by aiming a website at them or monitoring them. Failure to follow the GDPR’s strict data-privacy tenets can invoke eye-watering fines: up to 4% of the company’s global revenue or €20 million, whichever is higher.

&gt;No government has ever before sought to impose such a sweeping privacy control, perhaps because of the obviously deleterious effects on law enforcement. Already, the GDPR is bearing dangerous fruit. One of the world’s leading cybersecurity journalists, Brian Krebs,wrote last month that European-based security companies have become “reluctant to share” internet-address information that could help identify cybercriminals. Previously, security researchers had readily collaborated, but Mr. Krebs worried about a “chilling effect” from the GDPR.

&gt;American officials and cybersecurity experts have been raising alarms, with little result. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross wrote to EU officials in early April, saying that under the GDPR America’s ability to combat cybercrime “could be seriously harmed.” He asked for “temporary forbearance from GDPR enforcement on the processing of WHOIS information.”

&gt;Everyone values privacy. But the regulatory rubric the EU has created will make it harder than ever to catch computer hackers and other online criminals. Governments world-wide should be urgently pressing the EU to change this disastrous aspect of the regulation. Absent serious pressure, real reform will probably still come—but only after America and other nations are hit by a tidal wave of GDPR-enabled cybercrime.

4686,"Just goes to show how you likely know zilch about religion other than googling verses. Christians believe that they do not have to strictly adhere to all the laws of the Old Testament because Jesus came to fulfill the predictions of the prophets, who had long foretold that a Savior would one day appear. He came to fulfill the ceremonial law, by becoming the great sacrifice for sin, to which all the Old Testament offerings had ever pointed. He came to fulfill the moral law, by yielding to it a perfect obedience, which we could never have yielded - and by paying the penalty for our breaking of it with His atoning blood, which we could never have paid.

All the promises of God in the Old Testament are fulfilled in Jesus Christ. That is, when you have Christ, sooner or later you will have both Christ himself and all else that God promised through Christ.

For all the promises of God find their Yes in him. That is why it is through him that we utter our Amen to God for his glory. (2 Corinthians 1:20)

5. The law was kept perfectly by Christ. And all its penalties against God’s sinful people were poured out on Christ. Therefore, the law is now manifestly not the path to righteousness; Christ is. The ultimate goal of the law is that we would look to Christ, not law-keeping, for our righteousness.

For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes. (Romans 10:4)


Therefore, with the coming of Christ, virtually everything has changed:

1. The blood sacrifices ceased because Christ fulfilled all that they were pointing toward. He was the final, unrepeatable sacrifice for sins. Hebrews 9:12, “He entered once for all into the holy places, not by means of the blood of goats and calves but by means of his own blood, thus securing an eternal redemption.”

2. The priesthood that stood between worshiper and God has ceased. Hebrews 7:23–24, “The former priests were many in number, because they were prevented by death from continuing in office, but he holds his priesthood permanently, because he continues forever.”

3. The physical temple has ceased to be the geographic center of worship. Now, Christ himself is the center of worship. He is the “place,” the “tent,” and the “temple” where we meet God. Therefore, Christianity has no geographic center, no Mecca, no Jerusalem. John 4:21, 23, “Jesus said to her, ‘Woman, believe me, the hour is coming when neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father. . . . But the hour is coming, and is now here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth.’” John 2:19, 21, “‘Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.’ . . . He [Jesus] was speaking about the temple of his body.” Matthew 18:20, “For where two or three are gathered in my [Jesus’s] name, there am I among them.”

4. The food laws that set Israel apart from the nations have been fulfilled and ended in Christ. Mark 7:18–19, “[Jesus] said to them, . . . ‘Do you not see that whatever goes into a person from outside cannot defile him?’ . . . (Thus he declared all foods clean.)”

5. The establishment of civil law on the basis of an ethnically rooted people, who are ruled directly by God, has ceased. The people of God are no longer a unified political body or an ethnic group or a nation-state, but are exiles and sojourners among all ethnic groups and all states. Therefore, God’s will for states is not taken directly from the Old Testament theocratic order, but should now be re-established from place to place and from time to time by means that correspond to God’s sovereign rule over all peoples, and that correspond to the fact that genuine obedience, rooted as it is in faith in Christ, cannot be coerced by law. The state is therefore grounded in God, but not expressive of God’s immediate rule. Romans 13:1, “Let every person be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those that exist have been instituted by God.” John 18:36, “My [Jesus’s] kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, my servants would have been fighting.”

My comment is more of an answer to 'reddit anthropologists and linguists' who love to find Wikipedia articles about Balto-Slavic and then reach the conclusion Balts=Slavs, Baltic languages = Slavic languages and 'they're all the same'.

The alliance was signed because after annexation of Czechoslovakia it became obvious that Hitler is a warmonger who will sooner or later come to conflict with France in order to achieve hegemony over the continent. It was obviously not in the interest of France (because they were the ones who will be attacked first to avoid war on two fronts and also in order to regaun lost Alsace-Lorraine. It was also not in the interest of the British because German hegemony on the continent upsets the balance of power and threatens British safety in the long run (powerful Germany will have the resources to challenge British fleet and by extension the British nation). Both countries agree Hitler's expansion has to be stopped, every further free conquest will only make the future war harder for the Allied. So they give guarantee of independence against German threat to Poland so that the Poles will fight the Germans to the last breath, only problem is the Poles think and are assured that the alliance is there to protect Poland and create a 2 front offensive against Germany whereas the Allies (secretly) think of the Alliance as a way of buying time to mobilize the population and millitary for defensive war until Allied industry switches to war production and can catch up for the eventual offensive. It is not a conspiracy theory, I won't bother you with any more historical evidence to prove it, instead I will ask you: if you were Polish government - would you sign an Alliance treaty in which it was stated that your Allies will not come to your help and any action by them will be conducted months after your capitulation? I don't think they would. It's alternative history but we can only speculate if Polish government would in fact cede Danzig if the false promises weren't there.  
As to the second part of your post - I think you need to train understanding of written text, I stated that I do know that securing independent Poland was not realistic for the Allies at this point. This does not change the fact that the Poles, who in fact died in thousands in battles for France, Britain and various later offensives (so it could be even said that thousands of Poles died defending your independence whereas none of French and British died securing Polish independence because Polish independence was never the goal of the Allies and it was not achieved), can feel betrayed, the pacts WERE broken, regardless of how possible it was to uphold them.",,/r/europe/comments/8mwv1c/europe_at_the_height_of_german_control_in_1942/dzt7ads/,Felczer,1527665468

Finnish isn't *closely* related to e.g. Hungarian (and only even more distantly related to e.g. the Samoyedic languages, but that comparison is more like the relatedness of the Baltic and/or Slavic languages to a Germanic or Romance one). Of course we can never know for sure, and it is possible that part or theoretically even all of the common features are merely due to proximity, but afaik just proximity usually has a somewhat different ""signature"" on what the common features are.

&gt; Otherwise than that the only language that is at all similar to mine is Latvian. I can understand 5% of Slavic languages. But I can understand 5% of Romance languages. You know why? Because of International words.

Yes, Latvian &amp; Lithuanian are the only extant major Baltic languages, of course it's the only one you can understand to any reasonable degree, seeing as how the Baltic-Slavic split (as you yourself say) was probably an early one. And those sort of % comparisons are only a very small part on how languages are analyzed when attempting to determine if and how closely related they are. It also matters *which* words are the same, in addition to grammar (which you did mention), and there are other factors too. Also, those sort of analyses of ""similar words"" by laymen will vary, as cognates can look quite different while still remaining cognates, once you peel back a few centuries of shifts in how a word is pronounced/written, and thus not all cognates are obvious at first look.",Finland,/r/europe/comments/8msheo/answer_to_it_is_nice_to_be_here_in_eastern_europe/dzt368l/,ohitsasnaake,1527658159

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_bombing_during_World_War_II#US_bombing_in_Europe

The US had more heavily armed planes (13 heavy machine guns and heavy armor), which meant that their aircraft could take hits but hold less bombs.  The US also had the best bombsight of the war.  The combination of those two things meant that the US bomber strategy was to hit strategic factories and key infrastructure targets.

STILL, the name ''cale'', derives from the greek word ''kallis'', which means ''beautiful''. now, given the fact that when the greeks first arrived at the area they named the valley as ''kallis''=beautiful, therefore the name ''portus cale'' literally means ''beautiful port''.

5015,"Yeah the phrasing is weird, there's nothing wrong with people already cycling. But there is something wrong with your infrastructure if the only people cycling are middle class men! It suggests dangerous conditions and lack of practicality in cycling which means the only people who end up doing it are people looking to excercise with a job at a location where they can comfortably leave their expensive sportsbike and who are less hesitant to cycle in the risky traffic. Aka middle class men usually.  So the fact that this is the case in london suggests they haven't done enough to make cycling safe or practical. I think i can kind of assume this is what the quoted person meant when they said there were too many middle class men cycling, instead of meaning they wanted less of those men to cycle, but the wording is rather bad. 


Also to respond, there is absolutely nothing wrong with saying 'we have to encourage people to do x'. It's not treating them as children, it's treating them as humans. People who are used to living in a certain way or have certain habits don't always change that very quickly. Not quickly by themselves anyway. Again the reason minorities in the Netherlands cycle less than dutchies is because for native dutch people it's a habitual way of transport they grew up with from birth- dutch parents just send their kids to school by bike, it's not really a choice made by the kids themselves- and for people who(se parents) didn't grow up with that habit it might not be as obvious to take the bike everywhere. Encouragement to change people's habits in life for a positive change in society should always be attempted by the government, I think it's in fact a very important role.

Any savings you have you either keep in the bank or invest in state issued saving certificates which are fully guaranteed by the state and pay a small amount of interest.

Pensions are paid by the state when you reach retirment age based on your contributions. Social security is responsible for paying pensions to every worker, they have a fund which they invest very conservatively, though it has been dwindling mostly due being misused to cover up for shortages in other sectors of the state or due to the fact we have increasingly more pensioners and less contributors.",,/r/europe/comments/8n358x/markets_will_teach_italy_to_vote_for_the_right/dzsrt7a/,bora_la_pensar,1527644852

Wether it be to Slovenia, Croatia, BiH, Makedonia, etc., many soldiers didn't want any business in what the YPA did. Which means only the true fanatics (read Četniks) and the ones to stupid to decide for themselves stayed in the army. But in all of that it still showed the incompetence of the leadership, the lack of quality of the millitary equipment (although every true Yugo will say that technology from Yugoslavia was the best ever) and the lack of moral of the YPA, especially in the Siege of Vukovar. This of course is undermined by the quote by your leader Milosevic:


&gt;...Milošević je podsjetio i na „poražavajuću i ponižavajuću situaciju – da je sva pomoć koju je dobila Republika Srpska Krajina (naravno, od Vojske Jugoslavije, op. a.), praktično, završila kao naoružavanje hrvatske vojske“ te zaključio: „Da smo tog istog dana napravili idiotsku glupost da im pomognemo, ko bi to stigao do Knina do večeri da im pomogne!? Pa, tamo ne bi moglo da se stigne od njihovih kolona kojima su zakrčili sve puteve u bežaniji zajedno sa stanovništvom. (…) Molim vas, 6000 Hrvata (preuveličan broj, op. a.) je branilo Vukovar pola godine; napadala je cela Prva armija, vazduhoplovstvo, čudo, sva sila koju je imala JNA, a oni nisu odbranili Knin, kojem se može prići samo iz tri pravca; nisu ga mogli braniti ni 12 sati!?“",,/r/europe/comments/8mxfqc/monument_to_the_revolutionary_victory_of_the/dzss11b/,LoveMePleaseLoveMe,1527645074

Is this not a violation of international law? Yes or no.

Of course wartime atrocities existed on both sides, no one denies this, but that is not a revisionist policy.

Literally your former president denies this. Do I need to cite the fact that he said that the Azerbaijanis actually did it? Also, using PoWs to take down monuments isnt a wartime atrocity, its a deliberate attempt to destroy the Azerbaijani presence. Like settling them in areas outside of Lachin. Like seriously, this is incredibly common knowledge that they are doing this, the Minsk group has mentioned this before. Youre either ignorant, or telling a bold faced lie.

Iranian Azeris speak Azeri, watch Turkish soap opera, and do identify as such, in the diaspora they may want to fit in with the Persian diaspora. Really no one disputes this, not even Azerbaijanis. Being both Azeri and Iranian is compatible.

Everybody in the middle east and much of the balkans watch turkish soaps. Thats like saying that the English are actually Americans because they listen to American music. In fact, that is pretty much a great example. Yes, Azerbaijanis in Iran and Azerbaijan speak the same language, but they are as different as the Australians are to the Americans.

They dont like to be called Azeris, I would know that, I have many Iranian friends. Yes, if you ask them if they are Azeris and push them on it they will say yes, but only mostly in the vague American ""I have irish ancestry"" sense. 

&gt;""calls""? Officially those territories are not part of NKR. The NKR borders are not defined. Maps include the whole region, but that is not an official position. The reason is simple, the surrounding territories are legally recognised to be occupied and cannot be part of the NKR. And furthermore this has zilch to do with revisionism policies

On all of their maps, they do not mark the occupied territories, they are simply part of the NKR and the Azerbaijani occupied areas are marked as occupied. They treat them as such. [Also, they have been settling Syrian refugees in the area.](http://nkr-news.com/arcakh/poselivshiesya-v-arcakhe-sirijjskie-armya.html) So

Here is a fucking map from the NKR representatives in washington, 

http://www.nkrusa.org/assets/maps/armenia_administrative_map_large.jpg

&gt; These are recent and not from the Karabakh war, and no, you won't find similar things from the Armenian side.

Right, they just use white phosphorus.... I am not denying that Azerbaijan is worse, but you are literally ignoring every statement and talking about something else. 

&gt; Not as the many cases around the world can show and we have been already through this. You just insist on projecting the Turkish nationalisation project over all over the world which is asinine.

Lol, you just refuse to recognize Armenia can do anything wrong 

&gt; The ECRI releases reports on a monitoring cycles since both countries became members of the Council of Europe which was years after the Karabakh war ended.

Right, but it doesnt mention Karabakh contact in those reports...

&gt; Again, the destructions are all related to the war and are not the results of any revisionist policy. They are not part of any policy in NKR nor Armenia. Seriously you are looking for things which simply don't exist in an attempt to force false equivalency or assign some king of negative attributes to Armenians or go figure why you are so insistent. 

They literally forced PoWs to take down the memorial for its materials. Are you fucking kidding me? also lol at moving the goalposts. ",USA! USA! USA!,/r/europe/comments/8mjv7e/percentage_of_geographical_and_name_changes_due/dzsccss/,qasterix,1527629263

&gt;I am sorry to hear that. I often hear that German tourists cause trouble in many countries, and there are steoretypes about a certain type of German tourist even in Germany. It is mainly about how they are uneducated, unintelligent, and provincial. Afaik the country they bugger the most is Spain though.

Yes we don't get party tourism like Spain but old people and old people tend to sensitive of their needs and no one else in any country.


&gt;&gt;It is very common in your press can't say about the rest of population of course.
&gt;
&gt;Really? How come I do not really know much about that? Maybe I do not consume the ""right"" media!?

According to what It is been reported here yes. And here on reddit when it comes to Italian surrender jokes you are second after americans as culprits.

And really saying to us that we forgot fascism it's also annoying we didn't and we still are fractured due to the civil war we had in the last 2 years of ww2. We just see it as a national shame not a personal one .

&gt;&gt; And ww2 association is obvious.
&gt;
&gt;Afaik that is more about incompetence...

In ww2 yes. Ww1 depends the time and the sector.


&gt;&gt; [Smirk] nowadays we may actually beat you.
&gt;
&gt;That might very well be. I would not be surprised though if such a war became a total shitshow.

It would a very sad tragic comedy.



&gt;Sometimes I am actually surprised at how much crime happens here, especially petty crime. Because violent crime is rather low many of us think that Germany does better dealing with crime than it actually does.

When it comes to organised crime your problem is a lot of money cleansing and coke traffic. And if my relative which is a public prosecutor which deals often with organised crime and the financial crimes. Your police tend to ignore organise crime as long nobody dies and in common with our investigators cases it's often uncooperative. Which is a problem since 'ndranghta is very strong in some part of Germany. And organise crime is like cancer the more you ignore it the more it get worse.

&gt;&gt;[Laugh] sorry but it's really cooked and it's segment it is getting smaller each day.
&gt;
&gt;I guess articles like that target people like me that do not know much about Italy. Similar to many of those American random articles about e.g. French or German politics.

In general the foregin press tend to take out constantly Berlusconi  because he adds stereotype and colour. If you listen him nowadays in Italian it's almost depressing like watching like an old lady with the make up of a girl in it's 20s. If you get what I mean I despise him and yet this days I almost pity him.


&gt;&gt;
&gt;I agree. Fleischhauer is an insufferable twat who uses needlessly provocative language to maintain what little relevance he has (I am pretty sure no family member of mine ever even heard of him). I also do not like the Spiegel, whose ""good"" reputation seems to stem from one or two things they got right decades ago. I say ""good"" because I got the feeling that I am not the only one who noticed their current state.

We have some newspaper in similar state  as well. Not as a format tho l'espresso (basically Spiegel Italian equivalent) it's rather good actually.


&gt;Since I am German you know I had most likely ""similar"" experiences. And so I did. Consequently I can empathise with you to some degree. And using a tit for that approach is absolutely understandable.

Yes one want to be understanding but after a while one goes defensive. 


&gt; I am sorry if I have been too rude myself, and I also used too much hyperbole. 

I am sorry if have been too defensive myself this sub become often a shit show and makes me way more defensive than I would be in real life. No been able to see expression and year tones makes all more confuse also.


&gt; I just somehow got this perception that there is lots of, mostly unwarrented, hate towards Germans going around in Italy during the last years. So I probably was a bit defensive.

There is always been some distrust but bad sentiments are increased recently and not toward Germans alone people are very pissed for a various set of things from our politicians to the eu. However I will be honest this declaration will make at least for a while get worse the sentiment both toward Germany and commission he really should have kept quiet.





&gt;My other recent reply to you was probably formulated improperly too, and now seeing what a few German nimwits said to you online here (though some of them might just have gotten defensive too), I can see how you would be on guard from the very beginning of our conversation.

5365,"*I will paste here a comment I wrote in another thread*

Besides any economical concerns, they tried to force a name upon him, and he found himself compelled to reject it to preserve a principle. The Constitution entrusts to him the duty – not the privilege: the duty – to appoint a prime minister, and ""upon his proposal, the ministers"" (article 92). Between the President and the prime minister there is a strong bond of mutual trust: the prime minister himself and his cabinet take their oath of office ""in his hands"" (art. 93), and once appointed only the Parliament could dismiss them (art. 94).

Salvini and Di Maio just decided themselves the names of the ministers, and that of the prime minister (Giuseppe Conte), who then was sent to the President much like a mouthpiece. Anyway, the President welcomed him, even if Conte was almost unknown to everyone and without any prior political experience, and even if more than a few thought that he was chosen not because of his standing, but because he could be easily manipulated.

That said, well before yesterday some presidency officials let seep that Paolo Savona (the proposed minister of finances) was considered unfit for the role, not only because of his scepticism, but also for some over-the-top statements about Germany and Russia. Also, some days ago Savona resigned from the board of some foreign trust he was member of, ""because of incoming important public duties in Italy"", i.e. he was already sure to become minister even before the President not only had a chance to express his views, but even before the list of proposed ministers was in his hands.

When concerns about Savona begun to emerge, both from Quirinal palace and on newspapers, Salvini and Di Maio dug their heels on his name, and in doing so they also made it obvious that Conte (who was to become prime minister) was not free in his decisions, since that name was imposed on him from outside, and that he was not in a position where he could freely take note of the now unavoidable refusal and propose another name: Mattarella said them he could/would not appoint Savona a few days ago, and yesterday they sent Conte to meet with him and he proposed Savona as if nothing had happened.

In the end it became a conflict about powers rather than names: the President cannot accept any imposition, nor he can appoint as prime minister someone who seems to be forced. If Mattarella were to accept sight unseen what parties put before him, he would have set a precedent towards immediate and direct party power, a mortification of the Parliament and of the President himself. Mind you: Mattarella is a constitutional law professor and former constitutional judge, sure enough he knows the limits of both his powers and dueties. Most probably he knew that in the end Savona was not that dangerous, and that his refusal would be a huge boost for both Lega and Five Stars and expose him to strong disapproval, but they challenged him because of their electoral interests, or maybe to frame him, and he both sacrificed himself and maybe fell for it.

5420,"In all seriousness that was a good article and i can appreciate how reliant vulnerable people are on community services and the desire to have more money spent to improve them but, to play devils advocate, austerity has worked, we produced a budget surplus for the first time. In 2010, the current budget deficit was nearly £100bn which has now been wiped out. Even the IMF who historically were pretty anti-austerity are admitting its had positive financial effects.

In the perfect world we would now begin loosening the purse strings and consider funding community projects and events more, unfortunately this isn't a perfect world. We have spent roughly 60 billion already dealing with fallout from the Brexit vote, that is likely to go up considerably before the process is over. our debt-to-GDP ratio is up to nearly 90 per cent and we are still running a significant overall budget deficit (and are well within the recession danger zone). This isn't even considering we need to prepare for the possibility of a no deal Brexit which is looking more likely day by day.

I'm going to somewhat spit in the face of the overall message of that article and say that pensioners haven't been hit hard enough. Commitments to reform the triple-lock on pensions and means-test winter fuel payments should have been kept by the conservatives. No one else receives such lavish benefits and considering the voter demographics during the referendum they should be the ones shouldering the burden for the costs we now have to pay because of it. 

TLDR: Even though we are running a current budget surplus we are not in a position to end austerity or start splashing cash largely due to the impact (and impending impact) of Brexit. Fundamentally we are still living beyond our means and could run into significant financial problems if we start dramatically increasing spending levels.

If he takes a clear and strong political stance, you can't expect those who are against his ideals to stay cool and move on his side. And those people were elected through democratic elections. The finance minister isn't just another minister, it's a key minister of a political government. I agree that doing so should be considered a sign of respect for the institutions, but we aren't living in a timeless universe.

5588,"Germany and Latvia have the same voice in the Council even though they have about 40x more people. The parliament ~~is directly proportional to population~~ in order to balance power.

E: Not directly proportional, smaller countries are favoured.

&gt; EU citizens can only vote for MEP candidates of their own country, but the number of national delegates isn’t directly proportional to population size; if it were, Germany would get 200 times as many seats as tiny Malta. So the Parliament has always used a compromise that gives large countries a bigger say without drowning out the small ones. The European Union’s constitutional Treaty of Lisbon, signed in 2007, stipulated a maximum and minimum number of seats for each member state—96 and six, respectively—and also imposed a ceiling on the total number, 751.

&gt; But how to assign seats to individual countries within those limits is up to the Parliament itself. In 2007, MEPs proposed introducing an “undisputed mathematical formula” to implement the concept of “degressive proportionality,” stipulated in what was then the draft of the Lisbon Treaty. It meant that smaller member states can never have more seats than bigger ones, but do get more seats per million citizens.

&gt; At a 2-day workshop in Cambridge in 2011, held at the request of the European Parliament’s Committee on Constitutional Affairs (AFCO), Grimmett, Pukelsheim, and other experts devised a formula to do just that. The Cambridge Compromise, as it became known, assigned each member state five seats regardless of its size, and then allocated the remainder in proportion to population, but rounded up so that every country has at least six seats.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/8mzngl/planned_redistribution_of_seats_in_european/dzrndgc/,190518,1527607605

5603,"&gt; Sure, but you will not find anything in Vad Yashem minimising the culpability of the real designers and perpetrators of the Holocaust. Nor will you find any narratives doing such a thing with respect to he Holocaust to be acceptable, and yet Turkey is pushing for such narratives with respect to the Armenian Genocide. Context is one thing, and thinly veiled denialism and justifications of genocide is something else. 

When have I ever said such things. You keep talking about Turkey, when have I personally minimized the Armenian genocide. 

&gt; You again flip flopped from ""calculated rationality"" to ""rage"". Again, there was simply no place for Christians under the ideology of CUP.

They were  personally pissed and decided to kill off all chrisitans. Rage might imply lack of rationality, and for that I apologize for  the confusion, but the only synonym that has any sort of rationality attached to it is indignation, and there is a reason I didnt use that. All other synonyms imply loss of control, including revenge. They were mad, but completely in control and decided to take that out on the opponents. , 

&gt;ears and rage, even if existing, play no role when the ideology speaks for itself. Had CUP been made up of any people from the most benign leaders, if they employed the CUP ideology, Christians had no place there. Simple as that. 

No, but it is what brought them to the ideology. Yes, there can be rational evil people, but in the ideological framework of the Ottoman Empire, it makes no sense to hate christians for no reason, unless they feel it was necessary. Post Balkan Wars, they felt it was necessary. DAlso, many CuP leaders were pro christian, it was just the Turkist faction that gained control and started slaughtering people. 

&gt;Yes I agree that this is one certain possibility \- but that ain't no genocide. 

It is almost an inevitability, and jesus christ I have clarified many times. I am going to clarify this time and you are going to go right back to accusing me of genocide. 

&gt; None of that is still a genocide. 

Circassian genocide is definitely genocide, and those were a large chunk of the refugees.  Also, during the Balkan Crisis, [you had shit like this go on](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmanli_massacre), it was genocide. 

&gt; In the context you are using the Balkans is a red herring. The German role was direct to do with everything from consulting, to planning, to material support on one hand and ideology on how to form a nation\-state on the other hand. There is reason to believe that the idea of implementing a genocide to solve the Armenian Question might have come from the Germans to being with. 

That is literally the broadest claim of German involvement I have ever heard. Do you have any evidence to back this up? Not just German involvement, I mean, but their extensive assistance. 

&gt;What the Balkans provided was the experience of the empire losing territory by its constituent nations uprising, its effects as well the notion of how nationalism plays out. Rage or not rage.

5616,"I have read the entire Bible, taking notes, highlighting verse and looking up further information, while debating and discussing it about once a week for a couple of years with two fundamentalist Christians (Jehovas Witnesses) to get their side of things. 

The bible never says anything about the universe starting with an explosion. I don't know where you got that idea. Also, the big bang has nothing to do with evolution. 

The bible talks about homosexuality several times: 

* Leviticus 18:22 *Do not have sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman; that is detestable.*
* Leviticus 20:13 *if a man has sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. They are to be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads.*

And in the new testament:
 
* Romans 1:26-27 *For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature: And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was meet.*

I don't know how you think that has a symbolic meaning. It's pretty clear cut, especially the part about putting them to death. And if you think the bible is the word of God you don't get to cherry pick the parts you like and discard the rest. Either you believe it or you don't. You don't need the Bible if you are making up your own rules as you go anyway. 

Also comparing the Bible to the Red Riding Hood might seem natural as they are both works of fiction, but the major difference is that some people are forming their morality based on the Bible and then try to impose it on the rest of us.

5661,"&gt;This is not anecdotal, it's like saying you won't trust a person saying wwii happened.

As i said, single experiences are only of anecdotal value and don't support the point that much if we look at the grand picture. If only a single person says that WWII happened, then it just isn't enough. If thousands or millions say that however it's a different matter. (And for example, you wouldn't trust a single person on the subject if he is a staunch defender of flat earth would you? If millions do however, it is something to look at)

&gt; What I meant was that despite what Merkel intended to say initially, newspapers and analysts and everyone blew those wordsnout of proportion effectively broadcasting everywhere that Germany wants the refugees.

Now that i would agree with, the media interpreted words into what she said that didn't belong there. And not just the media, also those people who earn money with smuggling people. Any possibility to increase their business if they will gladly take.

But here is the thing, when the media publishes wrong information, that isn't the fault of Germany or Merkel. As i said, i would never vote for her, but i don't need to blame her for things that she isn't responsible for.

And returning to the number of refugees/migrants, i talked about smugglers, those people wouldn't publish that Hungary closed their borders. Even the press reported way more on the ""positive example"" that Germany set compared to what Hungary did. You would therefore expect the bell curve to have some distortion. To have 3 effects that align so perfectly that there is no disturbance visible is unlikely.

But let us ignore all that and just look at the data, even if what was reported did have an effect and increased the number of migrants (and when i say that i mean in a statistically significant way), there isn't that much space in the curve to account for them. It might be 20 or 40%. A large number. But if the large projects German in recent history like the BER airport were only 50% more expensive i would be as happy as i could possibly be.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/8msbpp/austria_to_cut_benefits_for_immigrants/dzrfzi0/,Alcobob,1527600265

5672,"It seems fairly clear that EU-elections don't work. At least here - people in the UK don't vote in them unless they have some grievance with the EU - so we saw an influx of UKIP MEPs. But is that a true representation of the UK's feelings towards Europe? Arguably not. And it isn't a true representation of the UK's governmental policy. How can you have MEPs representing a country that doesn't represent that country's government? 

Maybe it's because of my own issues with how it works out in the UK specifically but I don't believe it works and I don't think it fairly represents the country those MEPs are there to represent. 

I think the only way you can give more power to the EU parliament is by federalising the EU. Which would mean countries would begin to take those EU elections more seriously, I can only speak for the UK but it rarely goes beyond 40% turnout. Otherwise, it can seem as though you end up with diktats from Europe counter to domestic opinion. Just want to stress 'it *can* ***seem*** *as though*'.  

However, personally I have no issue with the laws passed by the EU - I support the EU and the general European movement. But a lot of my countrymen perceive it this way and I don't think that's unique to the UK either - although not in such a large group as in the UK.

5701,"More history myths, Germany paid far more reparations after WW2 than after WW1; ie they didn't 'learn' anything.

The peace imposed upon Germany after WW2 was so much harsher than anything in Versailles: huge size reduction, no foreign policy, splitting the country in 2, occupying the country and the Saarland protectorate, too name the biggest issues I can remember off the top of my head. 

The Germans had to ask permission from the British, French and Americans to reunify in 1990, that's the level of sovereignty Germany was allowed to have.

If you want a real parallel, try this one : The seizure of power by the Nazis was largely due to self inflicted austerity (the Bruning deflation of 1930-31) which caused an economic collapse similar (same ballpark) to that of Greece now.

The austerity imposed upon Greece WAS too harsh but it would not have happened otherwise. It was not politically possible, mostly because the extent of the structural hole Greece was in. 

It was either a bailout with harsh structural reforms or an exit from the euro.

Would it have been best for the ECB to start printing in 2008 or 9? Sure! Eurobonds all the way! But it was not politically possible. 

It's always very easy to go back and with hindsight propose better solutions... that weren't even on the table at the time. By that standard, just retroactively ban Greece from adopting the € in the 1st place.

Do you remember that no one in Greece or elsewhere even knew how much debt there was? And you want the thrifty Germans to print euros to cover something that isn't even quantified?

5725,"&gt; The Spanish had guns,

Ottomans had vastly gunpowdered units compared to the Balkan nations that time. Hell, it was the main reason of Ottoman advances in Europe. Early access to gunpowdered weapons. That's how the walls of Constantinople fell, remember?

&gt; natives had sticks 

Balkan natives had what? Sophisticated weapons? Give me a break. I won't discuss this any further. Natives of Balkans were unarmed or weakly armed compared to the Ottomans.

&gt; The main reason for the ottoman's expansion in the peninsula was the collaboration of various local leaders with them. The region had been in constant wars so a lot of them used the ottomans for their short-term interests. Ottoman armies had plenty of balkan soldier in them.

Exactly how Spaniards defeated Aztecs, who were bullying their neighbors. Cortez and Malincha (the Aztec girl) have the stories even dating to this day. Spaniards used the bullied people of Mexico against the strongest political entity on the land: Aztecs.  After they beheaded Montezuma, they kinda did what they intended do, which is why no one today speaks Naotl (Aztec language) or worships Kukulkan there.

&gt; If the goal of the ottomans was eradication not a single soul would have fought for them and while the ottoman were more advanced and a larger force they were not exactly running around with tanks.

You do not just go and tell people that you will eradicate them. Not even the Nazis told the Jews what was going to happen. Things don't work like that. You conquer the region first by getting the help of the locals, then you do whatever you want after consolidating your power.

&gt;Finally, a new alliance started to be formed in 1939. The Kasprzycki-Gamelin Convention was signed May 19, 1939 in Paris. It was named after Polish Minister of War Affairs General Tadeusz Kasprzycki and Commander of the French Army Maurice Gamelin. It was military (army-to-army, not state-to-state) convention and was not in force legally, as it was dependent on signing and ratification of political convention. It obliged both armies to provide help to each other in case of a war with Germany. **In May, Gamelin promised a ""bold relief offensive"" within three weeks of a German attack.The treaty became ratified by France on September 4, 1939, on the fourth day of German offensive on Poland.**

&gt;However, France provided only token help to Poland during the Polish Defensive War of 1939, in the form of the Saar Offensive. That is often considered an example of Western betrayal. However, the political convention was a basis of the recreation of the Polish Army in France

&gt;Piotr Zychowicz quotes memoirs of the French ambassador to Poland, Leon Noel, who as early as October 1938 wrote: ""It is of utmost importance that we remove from our obligations everything that would deprive French government the freedom of decision on the day when Poland finds itself in war with Germany"". Georges Bonnet reassured Noel, writing that ""our agreement with Poland is full of gaps, needed to keep our country away from war"".

[This article:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_betrayal#Beginning_of_WWII,_1939)


&gt;Upon the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany in September 1939, Britain and France declared war on Germany. On 3 September a naval blockade of Germany was initiated, and an attempt was made to bomb German warships in harbour on 4 September. Most British bomber activity over Germany was the dropping of propaganda leaflets and reconnaissance. On 4 September, during a Franco-British meeting in France, it was decided that no major land or air operations against Germany would take place, **and afterwards French military leader Gamelin issued orders prohibiting Polish military envoys lieutenant Wojciech Fyda and general Stanisław Burhardt-Bukacki from contacting him. In his post-war diaries general Edmund Ironside, the chief of Imperial General Staff commented on French promises ""The French had lied to the Poles in saying they are going to attack. There is no idea of it"".**


&gt;The French initiated full mobilization and began the limited Saar Offensive on 7 September but halted short of the German defensive lines and then withdrew to their own defences around 13 September. Poland was not notified of this decision. **Instead, Gamelin informed by dispatch marshal Edward Rydz-Śmigły that half of his divisions were in contact with the enemy, and that French advances had forced the Wehrmacht to withdraw at least six divisions from Poland. The Polish military envoy to France, general Stanisław Burhardt-Bukacki, upon receiving the text of the message sent by Gamelin, alerted marshal Śmigły: ""I received the message by general Gamelin. Please don't believe a single word in the dispatch"".** The following day, the commander of the French Military Mission to Poland, General Louis Faury, informed the Polish Chief of Staff, General Wacław Stachiewicz, that the planned major offensive on the western front had to be postponed from September 17 to September 20. At the same time, French divisions were ordered to retreat to their barracks along the Maginot Line.


&gt;On 17 September 1939 the Soviet Union invaded Poland, as agreed in advance with Germany following the signing of the Molotov Ribbentrop Pact. Britain and France did not take any action in response to the Soviet invasion. France and Britain did not launch a full land attack on Germany. Poland was overcome on 6 October.


[Anglo-Polish military alliance:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Polish_military_alliance#Polish-British_common_defence_pact)


&gt;On 25 August, two days after the Nazi-Soviet Pact, the Agreement of Mutual Assistance between the United Kingdom and Poland was signed. The agreement contained promises of mutual military assistance between the nations in the event either was attacked by some ""European country"". The United Kingdom, sensing a trend of German expansionism, sought to discourage German aggression by this show of solidarity. In a secret protocol of the pact, the United Kingdom offered assistance in the case of an attack on Poland specifically by Germany, while in the case of attack by other countries the parties were required to ""consult together on measures to be taken in common"".

5827,"No nothing about Polish history troughout ww2 is more innacurate than any other subject during ww2. You just think it is and Polish politicians abuse this for political gains. We Dutch people are fully aware you were victims and what was left of the Polish forces kept fighting bravely troughout Europe, including paradropping into the Netherlands during operation market garden with massive casualties.

And we do honor those Poles and anyone with even the slightest interest in history here knows about the Poles fighting here under the British. Including monuments and flags and all. Hell, we have streets named after Polish officers/soldiers that paradropped here. 

Its just you Poles who think youre looked down at for your role in ww2. No one else is doing that. And tbh, its annoying. If any bigot from the west isnt aware of what the Poles did in ww2 then he s not worth the trouble anyway and he s not someone you want on your side either.

Just let it slide. When i say Polish death camp im talking about a nazi death camp that was geographically in Poland. Not a death camp ran by Poles. If we talk about Poland being on the ''enemy'' side during the cold war we mean the Polish government during the cold war, not the Polish people who suffered greatly troughout the world wars and continued to be opressed by a sattelite government that was ruled from Moscow. 

Stop thinking the rest of the western world looks down on you. Whenever you go into a conversation assuming that you have to remind other people that you were on the right side, it just looks like another form of nationalism and blind pride to others.

There isn't a difference to begin with. Fidesz-Jobbik are irredentist-extremist political parties, influencing Transilvania, while PSD doesn't influence Hungary with anything.

”*you of all Romanians*”... pathetic, Ulrich/Laszlo.

&gt;I respect both of them.

Wrong answer but the previous giveaways were enough already.

&gt;The Ottomans made Banat the only region in present-day Romania to be incorporated into the Ottoman empire. They didn't give us shit. Austrians brought prosperity to the area.

Ulrich/Laszlo, listen, when your country ceased to exist and part of it made an eyalet, the same thing didn't happend with Transilvania and Banat. I know that, if you're a Laszlo, that's against your hungarianess visions of Hungary. If you're an Ulrich, even moreso with your austrian-saxon brothers and sisters.

&gt;Not afraid at all, Banat is a multi-ethnic region and it must remain one. We actually were a republic for a short period of time, too bad we thought a union with Bucharest would be more beneficial.

That's because you're colonialists, Ulrich/Laszlo. That's one of the problem, *you are*, you mustn't even be here in the first place. Of course you won't get it, of course.

&gt;You're free to come to Banat and ask Romanians if they want Banat to be a 100% Romanian region. The answer will be no, I can guarantee you.

&gt;&gt;„6. eine gerichtliche Untersuchung gegen jene Teilnehmer des Komplottes vom 28. Juni einzuleiten, die sich auf serbischem Territorium befinden; von der k. u. k. Regierung hierzu delegierte Organe werden an den diesbezüglichen Erhebungen teilnehmen;“

&gt;Do you know that the words ""mitwirken"" and ""teilnehmen"" mean?

Both of these terms mean 'participate'. Not 'assist', not 'advise', not 'support'. 'Participate'.

It is also important to translate the entire wording, as it otherwise would not become clear that the ultimatum carefully avoided naming which justice system the 'participants' outlined by Point 5 would operate under and how exactly the operatives of Point 6 would assist in the gathering of information in a Serbian court of law.

Just for the information for our fellow users:

Point 5 demands Serbia to agree to allow Austro-Hungarian government organs to assist suppression of the movement against the territorial integrity of the monarchy in Serbia.

Point 6 demands Serbia to initiate an investigation of the members of the conspiracy of 28 June on Serbian soil as well as allow the Austro-Hungarian government authorities to participate in the collection of information.

Serbia's main point of contention with the ultimatum was exactly this sixth point. The implication that such a demand was or still is a normality of diplomatic process is false. After its drafting on 23 July, the international opinion of it was pretty clear as in it being Austria's preferred way to go to war. Even Russian foreign minister Sazonov was in favor of Serbia accepting the ultimatum to call the perceived Austrian bluff - for Serbia itself though, allowing another country to dictate its justice system was simply unacceptable. If the United States sent an ultimatum to Russia tomorrow to hand them Edward Snowden or face war, one wouldn't look at the nuked ruins of Moscow and shrug either and say ""meh, the Russians deserved it for not complying with the ultimatum"".

&gt;It was not about Germany. I didn't say anything like that. So stop putting words in my mouth you declare nonsense. Thats just stupid.
&gt;
&gt; I said Germany made active efforts to stop this conflict from escalating. Keep the topic in mind. We are talking about Austria inciting a local conflict vs. all other powers of Europe escalating this little conflict into an all-european super-war.

Yes you did. You implied that the other countries wanted the war to escalate because of colonial conflicts with Germany. Only France and the UK could have possibly had those, and both of their roles in driving the July Crisis to war was secondary. Even the most ardent Germany apologists point the main Entente blame to Russia, not to France and Britain. Russia didn't have any overseas colonies, so going to war with Germany over overseas colonies would be rather weird.

But alright, fair enough, let's accept your premise. Explain then why Germany was the second nation to declare war after its own ally Austria-Hungary. And then, it was also the third nation to declare war. And it was the nation to invade another country - again, a neutral one which had done nothing than say ""we dont wanna be in your war plans pls could you like fight somewhere else and not kill our civilians kthxbai"" - to give the war hawks in Britain the reason they needed to go to war. Man, that de escalation strategy could have come straight out of Bismarck's feather.

You deem it justified to 'fire warning shots' at another country, you deem it justified to invade a neutral country that is not involved in the military alliance of your potential enemy for military purpose as long as the terms are 'generous', you deem it understandable to assure an ally of total and fully committed diplomatic and military support on the risk of military escalation as long as the local conflict, that you yourself admit was incited by Austria, stays local and the alliance was a thing before the crisis? 

And ***my*** view is one-sided? Germany could have prevented this entire conflict, including the local one, by telling the Austrians that they were unwilling to go to war. Which they were. The parliament didn't want it, the emperor didn't want it, the people at large definitely didn't want it. Doesn't make the government any less responsible for its actions though, does it? 'Pre-existing alliance' is not a valid reason to be a total fucking moron.

Just as an aside, these ""warning shots"" that Austria wanted to fire in the war that they went into without any outside provocation to do so? At least a ninth of the Serbian population perished in the conflict. 500,000 in a country of 4.5 million. Man would it have been great if that conflict stayed local and the Austrians got to do whatever the fuck they wanted. This is like the world war version of rape victim blaming, which is fascinating in a way.

&gt;World war was never a goal and could have prevented with ease at multiple points during that war.

Yeah. With Germany and Austria-Hungary being the two countries that could have prevented it all on their own, not even in the need of that pesky diplomacy. Austria-Hungary could have done by not starting the war, Germany by not providing the blank check. Had Germany not provided that pledge of allegiance, it is likely that not even the local conflict incited by Austria would have been incited by Austria.",The Vaterland,/r/europe/comments/8mwxk1/the_great_war/dzr71m6/,Aleksx000,1527585965

b\) cull a sizeable proportion of the poor, military age male populations who would be the driving force behind the coming revolutions.

Not for the Western civilization, only for the Balkans. Wonder why you include Byzantines into the ""Western sphere"" when the entity itself was hated by the West. 

If you do not know, the Catholic West was quite OK with the political entity of ""Byzantine heathens"" to collapse. It was just a city-state in 1400s anyway. Nothing like ""an empire"". Byzantines fell after 1204 with the sack, practically.

&gt;  The countries under Ottoman rule completely skipped very important and influential eras like the Renaissance, the Industrial Revolution etc. It's a division that's still visible in Europe.

That division is visible in the non-Ottoman occupied regions in Europe too.

It's as if Serbs, Bulgarians and Greeks would have colonized the solar system if it wasn't for the Ottoman rule. I mean, the capacity of Balkans has always been limited.

5982,"&gt; Not recognizing a vote because it doesn't fit into a believe should not be supported in Europe.

It's not ""supported"" in the US either.

&gt;When the US does this, it's not our problem.

When **people in the US** (which is what I assume you meant, unless you take these two gentlemen to represent the whole of Ireland) do the same thing, it's not the problem of everyone else in the US either, nor the country as a whole.

If the people have evidence, they provide it. If not, they're decried as nutjobs and treated accordingly by everyone except other nutjobs. They don't actually change anything. Hell, even when they do have evidence, it doesn't usually change anything.

&gt;why such practices are so dangerous for Europe

The only reason this would be ""dangerous"" for Europe is if Europe isn't smart or strong enough to treat nutjobs like nutjobs &amp; gives them credence and credibility merely for existing. If that's the case, that's the problem you should be working on, since that's where the real danger is.

* Anyone married to a Jewish person, yet not religious Jewish nor part of the Jewish Diaspora themselves
