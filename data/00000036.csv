(b) The Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense and the heads of other executive departments and agencies (agencies), as appropriate, shall ensure that Americans have priority access to United States Government COVID–19 Vaccines, and shall ensure that the most vulnerable United States populations have first access to such vaccines.

From the notes:

&gt;This method is not perfect as countries account for positivity differently. For instance, some countries (e.g. the UK, Italy) include lateral flow tests in its overall testing rates and positivity whereas other countries (e.g. Germany) only include PCR in their test results and positivity rates so their rates will appear higher and testing rates will appear lower. In addition, countries may opt to alter the way they account for things. While it's important to use this metric to help smooth out countries not doing enough testing, it's important to remember that it's not perfect and doesn't tell the full story.

76,"I'm using the data from worldometer which is taken from the government reporting. Lateral flow tests are included in the data if the government of that country is choosing to include lateral flow tests in their data. 

From the notes:

&gt;This method is not perfect as countries account for positivity differently. For instance, some countries (e.g. the UK, Italy) include lateral flow tests in its overall testing rates and positivity whereas other countries (e.g. Germany) only include PCR in their test results and positivity rates so their rates will appear higher and testing rates will appear lower. In addition, countries may opt to alter the way they account for things. While it's important to use this metric to help smooth out countries not doing enough testing, it's important to remember that it's not perfect and doesn't tell the full story.

It's still 100% more trustworthy than any institution in Russia.

&gt;So what you are saying is, that Soviets did invest, but they didnt invest as much as these states produced (ie they didnt invest the equivalent of their whole GDP) so it doesnt count?

Doesn't count for what? The point is that two Soviet claims are factually incorrect:

- the Soviets invested more in the Baltics than they themselves produced
- the Soviet investments were largely beneficial for the Baltics

&gt;Nice logic right there, ""lawyer"".

I'm sorry if basic logic causes your brain to freeze.

&gt;Yea? Like what, fortifications? Camps? How many factories did Germans open in Poland and France.

Lmao, they had their factories alright... It's insane that you don't see the irony of you not considering the German factories in these occupied countries as investments, yet consider the Soviet factories in occupied Baltics as investments...

260,"- beds don't mean good general care. It just means you have many beds in case an emergency arises. 
- the Dutch system of having the GP be the gatekeeper of specialized medicine is very efficient. Please note that the way the way Dutch hospitals work is different than that of other countries.
-yearly checkups are a waste of money and resources. That said, anyone is free to get as many checkups as they like. If you care about your health, go for it.
- I agree with little preventative care. This may be a problem of curative care doctors having such a large say in policy. Organizations like the ggd do offer a shit ton of preventative care though. But the current pandemic has shown that there needs to be more focus on preventative measures, not just scaling up beds.
- understaffing the ggd (and others) is a direct result of the current government policies. 12 years of cuts to preventative care and de-centralization.

The two aren't comparable at all because the UK left **little to no opportunity** for the EU to order UK sourced vaccines while **the EU took the money the UK tendered** for their products produced in the EU.

355,"&gt;I’m going off majority

Well, I'm not sure if the majority would be on your side with this reasoning, honestly. 

&gt;nobody thinks the eu is a country.

Again, when is something a country and when isn't it? The answer isn't as simple as you make it out to be. 

I agree that the EU isn't a country. But then again, I can't say I'm 100% certain on that. It really does depend on the definition someone uses. The EU has a parliament, an executive branch, a court system. All three branches of power are there. These institutions, you *could call them the government*, makes laws. Citizens vote in European elections. I can live and work and walk wherever I want. The EU has a flag, an anthem. Doesn't that *sound* like something a country would have?  

&gt;My definition of a country is a strong faction with its own government

Westminster is able to overrule anything Scotland wants... hell, Scotland can't leave the UK without asking for permission. A country would be able to do that without asking for permission, right? 

The UK was able to just leave the EU without permission. Sounds to me like the UK is calling to shots here, not Scotland, for example. Which is pretty weird, considering that Scotland is (allegedly) a country. 

&gt;military

[British Armed Forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Armed_Forces)? Seems like the UK has a pretty strong army... 

What about Scotland? England? If Scotland doesn't have a military... is it not a country? 

&gt;owning a vast amount of land

Is [Vatican City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vatican_City) a country? 

Yes, it's a city state, but 'the majority' of people call it a country. It's known for being the smallest of all countries. Are they wrong? 

&gt;sustainable economy

So a country in economic ruin isn't a country? 

&gt;along with trade relations with other countries.

If a country became 100% self-sustainable and stopped trading with other countries, it would cease to be a country? 

[This](https://www.worldometers.info/geography/alphabetical-list-of-countries/) list of countries names the UK, not Scotland/England/Wales. Just like [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_area) one. And [this](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/) one names the United Kingdom (not England or Wales or Scotland), but it does name the European Union. Huh. It also names Antarctica. 

Even [Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/topic/list-of-countries-1993160) doesn't name England or Scotland in their 'country' list.

372,"The fundamental misconception people, and specifically politicians that have a very good reason to distort the truth regarding the vaccine supply disparity between the US/UK and the EU is that there was some kind of unspoken agreement between nations to pool production capacity. And this agreement meant that nations who moved slowly and were hesitant with funding get access to the expanded production of other nations they invested little to nothing into.

The UK had almost no domestic capacity from the start, but spent big and early to build it up. I'm not aware of any foreign money used at UK facilities, but if there is it had to have been little and late because it would have made no economic sense to invest in the UK early on when they had almost no existing infrastructure.

The US had more but not nearly enough, and did the same as the UK with the added stipulation that any federal funds used for production would be accepted with the understanding that any supply created using those funds would remain on US soil and exported at the discretion of the executive branch. The feds jumping so quickly on all the expansion plans essentially drove all potential foreign investment away because all existing infrastructure was was part of these plans and no one would be able to mach the price anyways.

The EU had significantly more than the US/UK at the start and plenty of room for expansion. But dragged negotiations on with domestic manufacturers while others nations were throwing money at those same companies. Leading to the current scenario were EU companies have accepted money to export vaccines and new facilities coming online with a certain amount of supply already earmarked for that purpose

Not really how it works, otherwise we'd all be using the Chinese vaccine because millions of people got it. AZ has to provide data that clearly shows it works for people over 65. The fact that the US isn't on track to allow it and several european countries aren't giving it to people over 65 shows the data for that age group isn't as obvious as for Pfizer and Moderna.

 &gt;All the vaccines have those kind of side effects its a normal immune response, there is no evidence AZ is significantly different from other vaccines in that regard.

Yes, I know side effects are normal, but it seems they're stronger with the AZ vaccine:

447,"&gt;When I say Marx's communism didn't have an upper tier class, I mean quite literally, the theory does not.

And that was his main problem and his main failure.

&gt;Trump could label himself a proponent of democracy, but in practice, he was the opposite. Does that mean democracy is bad?

He did. He also labeled himself as a capitalist. By your own logic, why does it mean capitalism is bad just because Trump said it?

&gt;Communism is again, harder to pull off, so there are naturally fewer examples of the system actually being in place in history

The utopian version (the theory) is unachievable. It's a utopia that presumes no minority opinion, no egoism, no individualistic human behavior.

&gt;When I say capital is king, I mean a system that operates with capital accumulation as primary goal.

That's us as humans. We did the same under socialism, feudalism, tribalism... really doesn't matter the system. There's no way to avoid that.

Once you're at this step of the discussion this is not the real world anymore.

Even Marx argued that capitalism as a means of going after profit (excess capital) was a problem, not after doing after capital itself. He wasn't delusional.

&gt;I feel like this discussion would be way more clear to you if you simply look up basic definitions of the words communism, dictatorship, and capital, and an encyclopedia summary of the soviet union and the Spanish civil war.

The British government fucked the response to corona, and a lot of people have died. They've also fucked brexit. So they and the tory client media need to shit on the EU every opportunity they can, to distract from their domestic issues.

Unfortunately people in the UK are tired, blinded by jingoism, and insufficiently critical of the press to realise they're being misled. Because make no mistake, the British press are framing this as a great victory. I still read UK press and watch UK tv, and the news was all about how the UK was winning the vaccination war against the EU, IRC on the same day they'd passed a death toll of 100k.

Let the Brits have their pyrrhic victory. A lot of people have died. There's no future in England's dreaming, never has been. But they need a victory right now, so I say let them have it.

It's not a competition. It's good they're slowing the amount of deaths and with a bit of luck they'll be able to contain covid. One less source of infections to worry about.",,/r/europe/comments/lsfy70/eu_says_uk_us_have_vaccine_export_bans_eu_allows/gosf0f5/,DickCamembert,1614309353

578,"&gt;Putin is a dictator exactly because of capitalism. The foundation and origin of his political power is Russian oligarchy. Under communism, or any other system of horizontal / democratic organization his methods would be useless.

It wouldn't. All dictators need to maintain the upper tier class happy to gain power or remain in power (whilst eliminating every potential enemy from there). Lenin, Stalin, Xi, Kim Jong Un all did exactly this regardless of how they got to power and if the system was already established or not. And the system itself.

Democracy is a safeguard against this but it simply doesn't work with communism.

&gt;If you think communism ""by definition"" doesn't work outside a dictatorship, you either have a flawed definition of communism or dictatorship.

Nope, in it's definition the proletarian dictatorship needs to rule until communism is reached. In practice it's even worse. There's no space for minority opinions so there's no space democracy.

&gt;Do you think Catalonia in 1936 was a dictatorship?

It was anarchism or the closest we could get to it. That being said it was a congregation of little local dictatorships that ended once they no longer agreed.

No, tbh I see three differences:  
1) From my experience, the market in the Netherlands is dominated by non-profits. (Not the case in Switzerland).  
2) The insurance companies and their interest groups are super heavy lifters when it comes to lobbying. Hence, some regulations are really out of hand.  
3) A federalized structure with private and public providers led to an oversaturation of the market in Switzerland. The only possibility for a canton, private clinic, specialized doctor, or whoever wants to keep making a profit is to constantly improve, invest, and charge higher prices.

Separately, if you use best reasonable effort in regards to actually achieving the doses by the dates you run into two problems.

1. The doses and dates given aren’t by any measure an actual agreed deliverable. It’s just AZ saying this is the most you can expect. They’re not a target number. I cannot stress this enough. Again, refer to Schedule A. 

2. The EU have waived any right to take action against AZ for any delay in the delivery of the vaccine. See 15.1(e) of the contract.

I think the Uk govt. do that because they want to resonate with as many people as possible.

It is maybe starting to become an image problem for the UK? That people see it as a very demanding hard-to-work-with country.

I mean, the UK PM will sign agreements, and the day after claim that the stuff he agreed to is some sort of cheating.

Personally my experience of that kind of system was more as a single guy in The Netherlands and frankly it all felt like daylight robbery as not only was I paying more taxes than anywhere else I lived in before (or since) but the State actually provided less services than elsewhere hence these taxes-paid-directly-to-a-private-entity in the form of mandatory health insurance.

As I see it, one either pays more taxes and gets more and better State services (which I favour) or pays less taxes and then covers a lot more from one's own pocket, so I see many healthcare systems in Europe with mandatory health insurance as an indication of a system with the worse of both worlds: high taxes, low State service provision.

Maybe it's different in Germany (I've only lived there 3 months) but my previous experience in The Netherlands was that a healthcare system like that was just part of a broader high-tax low-state-services system.",,/r/europe/comments/ls0j14/healthcare_expenditure_in_europe/gopdr9o/,Aceticon,1614261247

Interest on bonds are a primary revenue source for said general population and their pension funds. Most of the interest does not end in megacorps tax havens, but in the populations funds.

Additional counter-argument: The liquidity tap you talk of would not be ended by this in any way. QE or minus interest financing wouldn't cease to exist. Au contraire - now that we know the ECB just buys shit back, whatever it is and then closes the loop by canceling the debt...it gets turbocharged.

The Allocation of said money to generate growth is and would be in serious trouble. The ECB creates money that doesn't circulate but gets horded at some safe place void of taxes, not buying anything but just cumulating, or creating bubbles in all the wrong places.

None of this would change.

In my opinion we should be very strict that especially the 1.7trn recovery fund gets spend WELL and sustainable. One way to make sure oof this is: keep the debt.

Another one is restriction of investments to a few sectors:

1150,"I don't fully agree with your assessment. Yes healthcare in Ireland leaves A LOT  to be desired and there are HUGE Problems but we do have free basic healthcare. Granted it's very heavily means tested to the point that if you are a single worker on minimum wage, you earn too much to qualify for full free healthcare. But there are a lot of healthcare services that are provided for free. 

There's the medical card which qualifies you for free GP care, extremely cheap prescriptions and free hospital care. You also can avail of a certain number of free treatments/visits from the dentist and optometrist. And there's other social services you may be entitled to.

Then there's the GP card which literally just covers the cost of GP visits.

Again, medical cards are means tested bug you may qualify for one on the grounds of a chronic illness while over 70's have their income assessed differently to the general population when applying. Under 6s are automatically entitled to a GP card and people in receipt of certain social welfare payments may also be automatically entitled to a medical card or GP card.

Basically, yes there is free basic healthcare but it's not universal. As of 2018, 32% of the population held a medical card. While 10% of the population held GP cards.

It is also worth noting that we do have various schemes that are free. Maternity services are free. Doctors check ups pre and post partum, visits from the public health nurse, development checks, and a certain number of scans (unless more are required) are all entirely free. Vaccinations are free. Lots of screening programmes are free, particularly cancer screening services. Hospital charges are a thing but are capped (to the tune of €80 per day for an in-patient to a max of €800 in a rolling year). A trip to the A&amp;E is €100 (unless referred by your GP, then its free). All outpatient care is free. Everyone in the state is entitled to a Drugs Payment Scheme card which will cap the monthly cost of prescriptions (I think to a max of €114pm) Bloodwork is not ""impossible"" to get done. They're freely done in all GPS. But unless you have a medical card you will be charged for them. There has also been a rise in the number of doctors charging medical card holders for bloodwork which absolutely should not happen. In fact extra charges in medical card holders are starting to appear but again, it shouldn't be a thing but seems to be borne of the State failing to properly reimburse GPs for the cost of certain services. 

Under resourcing is a huge issue as are working conditions (which under resourcing is a factor in)   there's a huge brain drain out of Ireland in medical professionals. But under resourcing wasn't responsible for the Cervical Screening scandal.

Also I'd love to know about this massive controversy involving health insurance companies. I've managed to find one article from 2 years ago saying that insurers weren't covering full costs in 1 out of 10 cases but I can't find any more info, would you be able to share?

Again, not in anyways trying to deny the huge problems in our healthcare system. In 2019 it cost the state €23.8bn. We regularly outspend most of Europe for healthcare per capita while failing to provide a service that's anywhere near comparible. (In 2017 the UK spent less per capita than Ireland and they have the bloody NHS) but citizens aren't entirely without a safety net and aren't billed for anything and everything like the US. Our system is a mess and often results in long waiting times. Its also hugely unequal in that  less well off patients will face a logn waiting list for initial assessments and will then go into a waiting list for treatment etc whereas patients who can afford to will often pay (through the nose) for the initial assessments to happen privately so they can leap frog their way into the waiting list for treatment.

So again, not trying to distract from how poor and under performing our health service is but Irish people have not been entirely thrown to the wolves of free market healthcare. Free healthcare is limited but affordable healthcare is universal.",,/r/europe/comments/ls0j14/healthcare_expenditure_in_europe/gop2l4k/,Nobody-Expects,1614254197
1151,"The Bismarck system is much better. You’d assume the Nordics smash it out the ballpark like in everything else but even they can’t get their Beveridge systems to work as well as e.g. Switzerland or the Netherlands. Countries like the Czech Republic and Estonia are surpassing us in rankings too.

The Beveridge system is too centralised and doesn’t allow for competition so you get worse healthcare poorly managed. It’s also not comprehensive - we say we have universal healthcare in Portugal but it doesn’t include dental or mental health. Something like a public health insurance (ADSE but universal) would go a long way in correcting this. As always though the devil is in the details - it needs to be properly implemented.

How, how, how could supporting the wealthy ever be a socialist thing?

""One cannot argue and say that eliminating taxes for those under 25 is economically right."" 

I guess that's true. But again it's only a token action instead of actually trying to improve the situation, like someone on the left would do. You see, it's the elimination of the income tax. Those with low income have such a low income tax that eliminating it is no real help.

1334,"I don't know about Podemos policy but the left-libertarian model is largely based on workers cooperatives. So workers own the means of production, not the state. In Spain they have the [largest cooperative in the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mondragon_Corporation) (or rather a federation of cooperatives).

As for private property, it's a debate about the commons really. Left liberatians respect personal property but largely oppose private ownership of the means of production and natural resources which are held to be owned either collectively or not at all owned. Excact policies are founded in those beliefs and some will argue that in some cases a state monopoly is the best way to achieve this (infrastructure is an easy example), while other left-libertarians would argue against a state entirely. The general line is however that left-libertarians believe certain things should not be privately owned, which is by no means an authoritarian belief. It depends a bit on how much of an anarchist you are. However all forms of left-libertarianism are strongly in favour of the free market, I would argue more so than any other ideology. Furthermore left-libertarians are not in favour of a strong state central but rather of decentral means of organisation.

And if there is no good infrastructure then you can't just drive like there is. You can't drive like on best Autobahns when you don't have them. If you  know that there are no circuits in your area you can't buy superbike or fast car and drive it top speed on public roads telling that it's fault of lack of places to drive like that. You can't buy Motocross and go to forests and destroy them because you have no Motocross tracks.

 But people have that crazy entitlement on context of vehicles and it's often almost sociopathic. It's like seeing neighbour with beautiful girlfriend but you don't have any so you find some girl and rape her. This comparison seems too harsh or crazy?

I am just worried that people here are not willing to do more. They have been used to lax recommendations the entire time. In my region masks had been recently recommended while using public transportation at all times (as opposed to rush hour recommendations only). Still see many people in busses not wearing them because well... there are no consequences.

It is funny because the argument here against locking down hard was always that those rules are not sustainable over a long time. This is of course my anecdotal and subjective view, but I don't see people taking more care than they did a year ago. People still meet large groups of friends, go shopping in groups.

The risk is about 1 in 1,250 for a woman who conceives at age 25. It increases to about 1 in 100 for a woman who conceives at age 40. The risks may be higher.

*The 1980 Mr Olympia was one of the most debated competitions in bodybuilding history. While training for his acting role in the 1982 film Conan the Barbarian, Arnold Schwarzenegger stunned the bodybuilding world by unexpectedly coming out of retirement and entering the Mr. Olympia contest one day prior to the event and after having trained for only eight weeks prior. After final judging, Arnold was declared the winner of the contest, a decision that was criticized by attendees and competitors because Arnold lacked his usual size and muscular definition. Many audience members booed as the results were announced. After accepting the runner-up position, Dickerson jumped off stage yelling ""I can’t believe it!"". Although Coe and Mentzer were tied for fourth in scoring, Mentzer was given the fifth place award. Mentzer was outspoken in his belief that he was the victim of politics and conspiracy.

2020,"&gt;Each week, Courrier international explains its editorial choices and the debates they sometimes provoke. In this issue, it is on the loss of influence of the European Union in the face of the major powers (United States, Russia, China) that we have chosen to return. And in this Making of, on the way in which the front page of the weekly magazine is developed on such a complex and difficult to illustrate subject.

&gt;How do you represent something that does not (physically) exist on the front page of a newspaper? In this case, the European Union, more fragile than ever at the beginning of 2021. While this issue is to be used as a support in some schools during the School Press and Media Week in March, we have chosen to go back over the process of drawing up the front page of the newspaper. 
First, there is the choice of subject. Between the UK's departure from the EU at the beginning of the year, the cacophony between member countries on Covid-19 vaccination, the recurring tensions with the United States (on tariffs, in particular), the Navalny affair (and the delicate relations with Russia) or the global agreement on investment negotiated at the end of the year with China, the European Union seems to be finding it increasingly difficult to make its voice heard.


&gt;The solution is simple: Europe must learn to speak the language of power, argues international policy expert Hans Kribbe in an interview with the Dutch daily De Volkskrant. In a world where strong leaders are emerging, the EU must stop preaching democracy and human rights and defend its interests more cynically, says this proponent of a more ""realistic"" policy very clearly. 

&gt;This interview was the basis for the dossier this week. It is accompanied by a very severe point of view towards Brussels published in Politico. An American journalist accuses Europe of having turned its back on the Biden administration: it has favoured China, notably by passing this trade agreement at the end of the year, and it has done business with Russia, by showing itself favourable to the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, against the advice of the Americans.

&gt;During the G7 summit, however, Joe Biden was conciliatory: ""The transatlantic alliance is back,"" he declared on 19 February. But the president also warned that the US allies ""will have to win Washington's confidence,"" notes The Times. In short, despite the departure of Donald Trump, there is no time for euphoria. In Asia, faced with the influence of China, Europe is also on the decline, notes the Nikkei Asia. As for Russia, it has no use for ""European lessons"" in the Navalny affair, its number one opponent to Vladimir Putin, now imprisoned.
Read also Germany. Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline is causing a stir on the Baltic Sea

&gt;How do you tell this on the cover? As every week, we met with the artistic director and the head of the newspaper's iconography department. The journalists who designed this dossier with the chief editor pitched their subject. In short, they summed up in a few words the intention of the dossier to allow us to think about the illustration of one.

&gt;In our exchanges, we started with the idea of a less influential Europe, a Europe that is smaller, inaudible, powerless against the United States, China or Russia. How to represent this idea? In a drawing more surely than in a photo: on this point, we all agreed. However, this time it was difficult to find the ad hoc drawing in our archives or in other newspapers. So an order to an illustrator came along: ""Let's ask Bertrams"", our art director said.
The illustrator Joep Bertrams, published in the Dutch newspaper De Groene Amsterdammer, is a regular for Courrier international. He has done a lot of front-page stories for us. His sense of caricature and irony are particularly appealing to us. We often ask him about France, but not only. In particular, he signed the cover of two specials on Europe, one of which, Une autre Europe est-elle possible, in which he took up his emblematic character of the European Union, an imposing woman of a certain age and a bit clumsy. But with the idea of the dossier, this massive character seemed less relevant.

&gt;A change of register was necessary. In the end, Bertrams chose an animal metaphor, and we find it particularly striking. Funny too, of course, tinged with his usual sarcasm. On the cover, it is no longer an assured Europe facing three disdainful giants (the Russian bear, the Chinese dragon and the American Uncle Sam), but a tiny Ursula von der Leyen (the President of the European Commission), who is haranguing in vain at the other great powers. That says it all.

&gt;From there, we have to start the exercise again and find a simple, straightforward title that echoes this image, without redundancy. It will be: ""Who is still listening to Europe?"".

&gt;Have a good read.

You act like a trade deficit is a good thing to have but the truth is if the US could it wouldn't be buying those things from other countries at all so the idea that it would be just fine and dandy in the event those goods were cut off is childishly naive.

Exactly because Italy has those skills and capabilities (including the work done on the F-35 at Cameri) the State didn't choose to join FCAS, because everyone knows that it's only a Franco-German project to try and get someone else to pay for their goals. Spain has sadly agreed to join FCAS, maybe it will be worth it for their needs but they sure won't get anything out of it that they aren't paying many times over.

[https://www.ed.ac.uk/files/atoms/files/scotland\_firstvaccinedata\_preprint.pdf](https://www.ed.ac.uk/files/atoms/files/scotland_firstvaccinedata_preprint.pdf)

The numbers 85% and 94% are so limited in their scope that no serious evaluation besides ""both are effective"" can be made.

Let's list the issues:

The 94% (and 85% to a slightly lesser degree) are just the naive numbers. The actual range off effectiveness, with a chance of 95% (p&lt;0.05), is between 73 and 99%.

The reported numbers are the peak VE (vaccine effect)  from all groups. At least for the BNT-Pfizer vaccine the VE drops after the 5th week. There is not enough data for the AZ vaccine to even make an evaluation.

Lastly, as the study directly notes, there was less follow-up time to get all the data for the Oxford vaccine.

&gt;  In addition, the effect of confounding likely differed between age groups. Individuals aged ≥80 years have been universally offered vaccination, whereas only those designated as clinically extremely vulnerable or at high occupation risk have been targeted for the receipt of a vaccine amongst the 18-65 year age group.\[4\] Also the ChAdOx1 vaccine has predominantly been used in the elderly and was only available from 4th January 2021, giving less time for follow-up.  

As visible in Figure 2 of the study, the difference between ""clinically extreme vulnerable"" and universally offered is visible and limits the comparability.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/lqpd6w/exclusive_astrazeneca_to_miss_secondquarter_eu/goldv74/,Alcobob,1614182308

2161,"2% is really what should be aimed for. 
Here’s the reasoning. 

https://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/economy_14400.htm

“The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) judges that inflation of 2 percent over the longer run, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, is most consistent with the Federal Reserve’s mandate for maximum employment and price stability. When households and businesses can reasonably expect inflation to remain low and stable, they are able to make sound decisions regarding saving, borrowing, and investment, which contributes to a well-functioning economy.

For many years, inflation in the United States has run below the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent goal. It is understandable that higher prices for essential items, such as food, gasoline, and shelter, add to the burdens faced by many families, especially those struggling with lost jobs and incomes. At the same time, inflation that is too low can weaken the economy. When inflation runs well below its desired level, households and businesses will come to expect this over time, pushing expectations for inflation in the future below the Federal Reserve’s longer-run inflation goal. This can pull actual inflation even lower, resulting in a cycle of ever-lower inflation and inflation expectations.

If inflation expectations fall, interest rates would decline too. In turn, there would be less room to cut interest rates to boost employment during an economic downturn. Evidence from around the world suggests that once this problem sets in, it can be very difficult to overcome. To address this challenge, following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation modestly above 2 percent for some time. By seeking inflation that averages 2 percent over time, the FOMC will help to ensure longer-run inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent.”",,/r/europe/comments/lqhvsf/annual_inflation_rates_in_january_2021/goleo4r/,randocadet,1614182659

2270,"&gt;One of the reasons behind the rise of nationalism in the Ottoman Empire is because the Ottoman themselves tried more humane policies, pushing for education and more equal rights. But as often when an authocracy decides to become more humane, things got out of control, there was just too much resentment, and only so much willingness to let the line of oppressors perform the otherwise very needed change to ottoman society.

Partially true but I think you are oversimplifying a bit which is understandable given how complex the topic is. You could argue that while the Ottomans didn't oppress minorities the way most European empires did, they still treated other ethnicities (and religions) as second tier citizens, which meant they were strict enough to let discontent grow while too lenient to prevent it in the first place. It also didn't help that the ottoman army went full British mode on every sign of resistance.

2450,"&gt; The first and foremost purpose of a vaccination is to protect the receiver of the vaccine from the disease. It's not the purpose of the vaccination to protect other people from getting infected

No, you got vaccination wrong man. The actual purpose of vaccination is to protect the general population, not an individual. That's why some vaccines are compulsory because there are people (for example immunodeficients) that can't be vaccinated so it is important that others are vaccinated so that they can't propagate the virus and infect people that are not able to get the vaccine and/or the cure. 

In school some vaccines are compulsory for this exact reason and kids are not accepted at school if they don't have certain vaccinations.  

The fact is that you don't live in a bubble all by yourself, you live in a society and if your choices endanger others then you should be put aside from that society.

2456,"&gt;Because you obviously will not acknowledge he is in prison for his political work and you keep dancing around that fact.

And I can acknowledge that - Navalny is absolutely a POC and is held in prison for his political views and political actions - but my view on it, my support for anti-Putin politicians, my anti-Russian-regime views etc. does not matter at all! We're discussing Amnesty labelling him a POC or not, not me. Hence it seems weird why you want to somehow make this a personal attack against me.

&gt;No one cares about legal terms beside you.

That's your problem, not mine. I am not going to be outraged over something that is purely symbolic (unless you can show me how this actually changes his legal status - i.e. how not calling him a POC means Russia can repress him freely). **Amnesty is still supporting him and calling for his release.** That is what matters to me.

&gt;And it's hard to take Amnesty International seriously because his comments 13 years ago that he apologized for has nothing to do with his political work today and is not why he is in prison now.

That's your choice. I have no issue that Amnesty does not choose to treat morons who call Georgians rodents, who participate in right wing marches and who call for an invasion of Georgia with preferential symbolic treatment.

My point is purely centered on the fact that POC status is symbolic. Why I keep repeating ''legal terms'' is because revoking the status does not impede Amnestys work towards freeing him or calling for freeing him. **The actual work for freeing him** matters to me, not what labels Amnesty decides to call him.

2510,"I'm a card carrying, Europe-loving, wishy-washy centre-left liberal. It therefore pains me to point this out: the EU in general, Ursula von der Leyen specifically, and some of the prominent European leaders such as Emmanuel Macron are getting policy and messaging on vaccines badly wrong. They need to urgently ditch the peacock displays of tribal politics. The French president, in particular, who leads one of the most vaccine sceptical western nations, should not have so publicly questioned the efficacy of what has clearly turned out to be a vaccine that is working in the fight against Covid-19. The consequences of their words could well be long-lasting.

'The early results we have are not encouraging,' said Macron earlier this month, referring to the vaccine effects for 60 to 65-year-olds. His words were premature at the time and look even more so now, in the wake of fantastic data showing the effects of the ChAdOx and Pfizer vaccines in the real world, with around a 94 per cent and 85 per cent reduction in hospitalisations.

I am an investigator in the ChAdOx vaccine studies, so I have a stake in these trials, but nonetheless the facts speak for themselves: the Oxford vaccine is helping to ensure that many people do not fall seriously ill from coronavirus.

It's true that there are important caveats in the data published yesterday. The timings of when the vaccines were given are slightly different and affected by the extended second wave and subsequent lockdown, so it is not wise to compare the two vaccines head-to-head. This is known in the business as a confounding variable in an observational study and it is why randomisation is the keystone of modern trials. It means you need to take any conclusions with a pinch of salt. Despite this, the main take home message is that once the vaccines are given time to work, they work spectacularly well.

Yet across the Channel, there are reports in France, Germany and other countries of ChAdOx vaccines being left unused and even healthcare professionals expressing reluctance. It's hard to avoid the conclusion that the misinformation put out by the likes of Macron has had some impact here.

The snail-like roll out of the vaccines in Europe has, of course, been well covered. But the mud thrown at the Oxford vaccine has decidedly stuck. Our government has been pleasantly restrained in not taking the bait and demonising the EU in return.

There are signs that the unfair criticism levelled at the Oxford vaccine may also be affecting decisions outside Europe. South Africa, where at least there might be mitigating circumstances with the ubiquity of the B.1.351 variant which has shown some evidence of diminished effects to most of the vaccines, has reportedly asked the Serum Institute to take back 100 million doses of the Oxford vaccine. In Australia, some scientists have suggested the Oxford vaccination should be paused.

It has been a source of enormous frustration to watch an effective vaccine that is convenient enough to be used in diverse settings and which has explicitly achieved a goal to be affordable for the whole world to be criticised by those who should know better.

So how did we get to this sorry state of affairs?

The first thing is to understand the criticism, some of which is fair. The critical Oxford vaccine trials were not run by AstraZeneca, but were funded through a mix of charitable and UK grant funding. Rather than one massive international pharma sponsored and run mega-trial, there were several smaller but linked studies.

Put simply there was less money in these trials. They did, however, have the formidable engine of the UK National Institute of Health Research infrastructure to aid them. They were run at a breakneck speed. I have written extensively about how this process had no impact on safety and these early articles are ageing well as the real world experience confirms this view.

However, the sped up timeframes used initially meant less time was available to be clear what a perfect trial would look like from the perspective of showing that a vaccine works. This is quite a technical and poorly understood point but it is important. 

All of the trials took slightly different approaches in what they defined as a 'positive case', how big they were and how fast they might accumulate the all-important 'events' (those positive cases). They took different approaches to boosters and whether to do screening for asymptomatic cases. This field has now settled, partly because most companies will do what the FDA want them to do, but the Oxford vaccine was not aimed primarily at the FDA and for a variety of reasons it looked different.

Next we come to the much publicised initial problems surrounding the batch manufacture 'error' and dramatic headlines across the world when individual possible adverse effects were being reported. Because the Oxford vaccine was effectively the first to be rolled out in large populations, these events were reported in real time, inaccurately and with a megaphone. Science should not work like this but it is understandable. Further down the line, neither of these things appears to be of any major importance but mud sticks.

Next up on the slate is the decision to publish a 'meta-analyses' of results from the differing trials early. This was taken by an independent committee who had reviewed the results of the trials. They felt the ethical thing to do was to publish early, largely because this data passed the bar that international regulators set out for a successful vaccine. While this decision was commendable, it meant the early data was more complex to interpret. Inevitably, some conflicting international reporting followed and political agendas could be seen creeping in. That some countries have still not licensed the Oxford vaccine on the basis of this data should be a matter for reflection on their part, but each country has its own local tensions.

Lastly is the older population issue. The bulk of ChAdOx participants in the biggest trial were healthcare workers (HCWs) and by definition not going to be over 65. This was partly pragmatic, as unfortunately HCWs were the most high-risk and therefore most likely to generate positive cases.",,/r/europe/comments/lr75ex/we_could_all_pay_the_price_for_the_eus_foolish/gok8ccy/,casualphilosopher1,1614153481

If you think back to last May there was still uncertainty over what the second waves might look like, so this was a decent bet. Starting in a younger, healthier population is also always the safest way to do something as you are less at risk of unrelated but significant co-existing problems being potentially associated with your therapy. The additional trials in older subjects are still ongoing but I personally feel all of this was poorly explained generally and mendaciously misrepresented in some places.

Now we come to the bigger problems. All of the above would normally be minor, interesting technical issues for nerds like myself to mull over in conferences. They have unfortunately fallen victim to international good- and bad-faith scrutiny and the worst impulses of nationalism (and in the case of the EU bloc-ism). There has been some very poor quality reporting and unwise interventions from scientists who should, but often don’t, know better.

In the UK we have done a good job of maintaining vaccine confidence. This is partly historical, partly accident and partly, I like to delude myself, due to enthusiastic amateurs like myself trying their best to counter vaccine myths.

However this is also undoubtedly because we had skin in the game. The historical part is that we are usually quite a vaccine confident nation. On top of this, there was definitely some jingoism that one of the front-runners was home-grown and so reporting in the UK was generally more lenient and restrained.

The government was positive but muted. There was no central-led strong public information campaign. This was in some ways a positive thing because government voices are not necessarily the most trusted in this area. The regulators were brilliant and kept it simple. Trials were obviously safe and effective. The trees did not obscure the wood. The unequivocal success of the vaccine roll-out has created a positive feedback loop in the UK. It is notable that I no longer feel a compulsive nightly need to tweet much about vaccine hesitancy, the battle definitely feels like it is being won. We have become a serendipitous roadmap for how you do this. So here it is

-Message discipline from government, scientists and media. Don’t comment early, wait until data is clear. Address vaccine hesitancy with patience. Keep the big picture in mind.

-Vaccines do not need kid gloves. They are unbelievably safe in general. By applying kid gloves you raise concerns (why the kid gloves?). Trust your regulators and the regulatory process. Countries that ostentatiously delayed when they had the same data are now being viewed as ponderous and have spread undue concern. Regulators should be allowed to regulate.

-Don’t play vaccine nationalism. We really are only as strong as the weakest link on this one. A handful of countries going epidemic can kick off pandemic 2.0. We may not avoid this anyway but, either way, vaccine confidence needs to be rock solid. The UK's decision to pledge excess vaccines to developing world is a step in the right direction but we need more than one half step. The WHO attempts to unite us all need serious buy-in.

-Roll out quickly and confidently and watch as momentum gathers and people start to see for themselves that the vaccines are safe.

Prominently vaccine hesitant countries where governments, commissions, journalists and even scientists are currently complicating what is a pretty simple picture, need to reflect on the success of countries like Israel and the UK. It is one of the few areas we can claim any success at all. But in the same way the UK has had to painfully learn lessons in every other area of Covid-19 management, we are currently succeeding here. 

If leaders like Emmanuel Macron and Ursula von der Leyen continue to play tribal small politics with this, the effects will be long-lasting and profound. It is highly likely that we will end up all needing regular vaccination, and if we start off on the wrong foot internationally, recovering our balance is going to be possibly as painful for all of us, as the last year has been for the UK.",,/r/europe/comments/lr75ex/we_could_all_pay_the_price_for_the_eus_foolish/gok8cj4/,casualphilosopher1,1614153486

2514,"A new party is riding high in the Czech Republic, with the wind of change in its sails. Polls now suggest that the Czech Pirate Party, in coalition with a collection of mayors and independents, could win the largest share of the vote in the Czech Republic’s October elections.

It’s a remarkable turnaround for a party that at first sounds like the Czech answer to the monster raving loony party. But the Pirate Party has become a force to be reckoned with in Czech politics.

Formed in 2009 as one of many Pirate Parties around the world who came to international prominence following a police raid on the download site The Pirate Bay, the Czech Pirate Party was for a long time seen as a fringe movement. Its original aims were to reform copyright law and legalise marijuana, which are hardly the main concerns of swing voters.

It broke into the political mainstream in the Czech Republic’s 2017 elections, but only began to be seen as a serious player in 2019, when the largest demonstrations seen in the Czech Republic since the fall of communism took place in Prague. Over 250,000 people gathered to protest against the current Prime Minister, Andrej Babiš, who is the fourth richest man in the country and the owner of some of its most influential newspapers. His conflicts of interest resulting from his ownership of the Agrofert conglomerate have provoked outrage here, and there has been widespread speculation about his rumoured connection to the StB, the Czechoslovak secret police during the Communist era, which Babiš denies. 

Babiš has been a divisive Prime Minister, and this year’s vote has for many become a referendum on his leadership. Coalitions have formed in opposition to the Prime Minister across the political spectrum. And the Czech Pirates have managed to become the face of the anti-Babiš movement.

A recent poll showed that the Pirates+STAN coalition are on 29.5 per cent, ahead of Babiš‘s ‘ANO’ (YES) party on 26.5 per cent. Babiš and his allies look increasingly concerned about the situation: President Miloš Zeman has suggested that ANO would have first priority to form a government, even if it received fewer votes than the Pirates+STAN.

In other countries, Pirate Parties rarely win more than 1 per cent of the vote and almost never move beyond their youth-driven, grassroots origins. But in recent years the Czech Pirate Party has created a major platform with widespread appeal, advocating individual freedom, modernisation, democratic reform, and enhanced EU cooperation. Its key policies include the use of technology and online communications to promote transparency and increase democratic participation, a lower income tax rate, the digitisation of public offices and state procedures, and ‘upgrades’ to fix the EU’s democratic deficit. The programme is impressively far-reaching – it is quite unusual for a ‘Pirate Code’ to include a comprehensive programme on pension reform.

The party has a large and dedicated following, especially among young people in big cities like Prague. The Pirates are generally seen as open, relatable, honest – and entirely ‘Czech’, with the international Pirate movement rarely figuring in party discussions. In the 2017 elections, the Pirates entered the Czech Parliament for the first time, taking 22 out of 200 seats. A year later, the Pirate Zdeněk Hřib became Mayor of Prague.

The Pirates’ unconventional origins might have worked against them in the past – their current leader’s distinctive dreadlocks, for example, are probably enough to make most conservative Czechs wring their hands in despair. But with most of the opposition tarnished by scandal over the years, the Pirates have been able to proudly claim that they are the only Czech party unconnected with corruption and sleaze. This message is powerful in the current political climate.

The party’s virtuous image is enhanced as well by the apparent integrity of leading Pirates. The dreadlocks of their leader, Ivan Bartoš, are too much for some people, but for others they signify a kind of authenticity thought to be lacking in Babiš. Bartoš clearly understands the symbolism, and he has promised to not shave off his dreadlocks even if he becomes Prime Minister.

The Pirate Prague Mayor, Zdeněk Hřib, has also been unafraid of controversy. In 2020 he renamed the public square outside the Russian embassy after Boris Nemtsov, an outspoken Putin critic and key Russian opposition figure before he was assassinated in 2015. In doing so, Hřib provoked a diplomatic crisis with Russia and an alleged assassination attempt. But he also showed that, as a Pirate, he was willing to stand up for his principles.

It remains to be seen if the Pirate Party’s pure image will be sullied after the October election. To displace Babiš the Pirates will need to form a coalition with other parties, which will inevitably involve compromises. The Pirates certainly appear to understand this political reality, with Bartoš so far refusing to discuss the messy business of coalition building.

The run-up to this year’s elections and the political bargaining to come afterwards will undoubtedly be tricky waters for the Pirates to navigate. Dilute their principles too much, and they will be seen as having broken their promises to reset the system. Even so, the Czech Pirate Party has already shown the potential for a youth-led activist movement to transform itself into a broad political platform when enough people share its hunger for reform. And for now, their open approach to politics makes them the face of change in the Czech Republic.",,/r/europe/comments/lr76sq/the_remarkable_rise_of_the_czech_pirate_party/gok8fqm/,casualphilosopher1,1614153568

2591,"&gt;TIL the EU is about flowers and disco lemonade. If it makes bad deals, it is because it is actually too lovely.

But this isn't about a bad deal. We didn't buy a bad product. We don't have to pay for a product we don't receive.

It's about a seller that doesn't deliver. How is this a fucking bad deal here? If I buy something from you it's not enough that you don't receive money without giving me the product? I also need to sue you or something? How will a contract make up for AZ acting late in the manufacturing process?

&gt;From the UK perspective, it is the EU (both organisation and fanboys) who are mixing AZ and the UK. The tacit accusation of the UK stealing EU vaccines is one example of this.

UK shouldn't have any perspective on this. UK is not on reddit. Brits here are. They are making this confusion. Because they are confusing AZ with UK. Btw, the only one accused of stealing was EU when they asked why AZ doesn't respect it's contract and doesn't get deliveries from it's UK plant.

Accusing UK of being protectionist behind closed doors isn't equal to accusing it of stealing. Haven't seen people here saying anything like that.

&gt;Showing off - this thread, not a race - VDL, UK more deaths - every AZ thread

I would be very glad if they would show off, UK deserve it. They do have a lot of deaths and that's exactly why good news should be very welcomed.

What isn't welcomed are the comments of how 'EU screwed up' and that's the first thing most british commenters here say. Naturally those that aren't content with how EU countries are doing but don't believe the EU is to blame here are going to react.

&gt;Agreed - but am I wrong in thinking that a UK university with UK state funding is part of the UK state? The IP was given profit free to other countries - I can't see any other nations doing this. You're welcome :-)

It wasn't. IP wasn't given at all, regardless where or who funds Oxford. And Oxford isn't the party responsible for manufacturing and selling.

&gt;However, I can safely say that you guys are more nationalist than us.

Without any doubt. But we're also the first to judge any small mishandling of our government or the EU.

And yet this has nothing to do with the behaviour of a lot of brits on this sub and in the media regarding how they feel personally attacked for any critique at AZ.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/lqpd6w/exclusive_astrazeneca_to_miss_secondquarter_eu/gojzbzz/,SmokeyCosmin,1614146027

It's probably a combination of inertia and the lack of a need to replace the old system. I mean, it's nice to have 24/7 transaction settlement, but I think in the 90s or 00s that appetite for it would have been pretty low given that most things would have been done by mail or phone anyway (ie no banking apps) and the banks were only open M-F 9-5 anyhow, so there wasn't really a need for it.

2772,"&gt; Many parents know the situation: their son or daughter stubbornly refuses to clean up the children's room. Simply because the sense of the whole thing is partout questioned. But if the conviction is missing, it becomes difficult. The situation is similar in the case of Hungary and Poland. For years, the European Union has been trying to make it clear to the governments in Budapest and Warsaw that it is not a trivial offense to drag down rule-of-law standards. With manageable results - as the last few weeks and days have shown.
&gt; 
&gt; It has long since become a certainty that neither Polish head of government Mateusz Morawiecki nor Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán are willing to accept the EU regulation on the rule of law. Lawsuits have been announced. This is despite the fact that at the end of 2020, the heads of state and government accommodated Budapest and Warsaw, not least at the instigation of Germany, in order to save the budget and, above all, the billions of euros in EU Corona aid. The principle, after all, remained intact: Violations of the rule of law can result in the affected state having EU funds cut. However, targeted governments can now request a review of these sanctions by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) - meaning that proceedings are likely to be delayed by many months. Advocates of consistent punishment for violations of the rule of law reacted with disappointment, even bitterness.
&gt; 
&gt; Orbán government equalizes the media landscape
&gt; 
&gt; A look at Hungary shows that the Orbán government is continuing unwaveringly to level the media landscape. Now the last independent station with a relevant reach, Klubradio, has been hit. The Budapest Municipal Court has ruled that the station, which had around half a million listeners, will fall silent as of next Monday. The license will not be renewed - now all that remains for Klubradio is a small niche on the Internet. In the end, it was about rather marginal violations of reporting obligations.
&gt; 
&gt; The court thus followed a decision by the media supervisory authority, which is staffed with supporters of the authoritarian ruling party Fidesz. Restrictions on media freedom in Hungary had led to EU Commission Vice President Vera Jourova's statement in spring 2020 that Orbán was in the process of building ""a sick democracy."" The enraged prime minister retaliated by demanding that Jourova resign. Viktor Orbán has long left no doubt about what he thinks of liberal Western values: nothing. In September 2020, the head of government published an essay in the pro-government daily Magyar Nemzet in which he described liberal, cosmopolitan principles of the West as incompatible with those of the ""Christian conservative"" East. The same applied to education policy, he said. He even described contacts between Green and conservative parties in Austria and Germany as a ""perversion."" In addition, there are campaigns with anti-Semitic undertones, such as those against U.S. billionaire George Soros. Orbán hardly misses an opportunity to murmur warnings against ""elites"" and ""groups"" operating in the background, who have set themselves the goal of destroying nation states and Christian values. In doing so, he deliberately incorporates widespread elements of conspiracy theories into his argumentation.
&gt; 
&gt; Like Hungary, Poland has increasingly abandoned constitutional values since the national conservative PiS party took over the government. Take the media, for example: While the government can already rely on its henchmen in the public television and radio stations, it is trying to gain influence step by step in the private media sector as well. But many publishers have resisted and continue to resist. However, the air is getting thinner. For years, PiS Chairman Jaroslaw Kaczynski has castigated the influence of foreign - including many German - publishers. He says they are partly to blame for ""corrupting"" young people. There have been buybacks by Polish corporations. A large regional newspaper group was acquired by the state-controlled oil company Orlen. Now the private sector is being put under increased financial pressure: A levy on advertising revenues generated is planned, which would hit publishers hard. On Wednesday, 40 media companies protested in a coordinated action. Broadcasts were cancelled, statements were read out and printed in the newspapers. These urgently warned of an impending end to media freedom.
&gt; 
&gt; Polish government fears independent judges
&gt; 
&gt; The ongoing clash between the EU and Warsaw over the independence of the Polish judiciary is by no means over. A lawsuit by the European Court of Justice is currently threatening. Specifically, it concerns the Disciplinary Chamber of the Polish Supreme Court, which was created in the course of the controversial judicial reform. The chamber can take action against judges and prosecutors and dismiss them. There are massive doubts about its independence. Despite an ECJ order that the chamber suspend its activities due to these doubts, it continued its work - a clear breach of the law. In October 2020, the Disciplinary Chamber lifted the immunity of Judge Beata Morawiec, who is considered a fierce critic of judicial reform. Thus, it seems to be confirmed that the chamber is an instrument of PiS to get rid of disagreeable jurists. Now the cat-and-mouse game continues: Warsaw has until the end of February to dispel the concerns, otherwise the EU Commission can appeal to the ECJ.
&gt; 
&gt; Skeptics wonder whether it will be possible to protect rule-of-law standards against the will of a government. Poland and Hungary are primarily interested in, indeed dependent on, the financial benefits of EU membership. This is the lever for Brussels to at least contain the violation of rule-of-law principles. In the longer term, the hope remains that the population will not put up with the loss of democratic rights forever. In Poland, this hope has grown in recent weeks.

2835,"&gt; I know the system, but there's no reason the new leadership can't exploit the same situation to its advantage. Or defuse it in some way in favor of national unity, if so desired.

The new leadership, as you call it, has spent the last couple of decades if not centuries oppressing the majority as the colonial master's servants. If you think that can be defused, you're much more optimistic than I am.

&gt; Conversely, European colonization also forged states out of very large but previously politically fragmented areas that also were engaging in the same war dynamic. Africa was no paradise without history before the coming of Europeans.

It forged states out of lands and peoples that had no business being part of the same states, because they, as you said it, hated each other.

I never said Africa was a paradise before. Then again, WW2 ended 75 years ago, and the USSR collapsed 30 years ago, so neither was Europe.

&gt; Well, lives lost alone would create a massive advantage in favor of the colonizer, as the population at the time of decolonization was several times higher than at the start of colonization.

From Encyclopedia Britannica re: Congo under Leopold:
&gt; The population of the entire state is said to have declined from some 20 million to 8 million.

And from the top of my head, I seem to recall some talk about the various famines in Ireland, India, Ukraine... All caused by the colonial masters.

&gt; So if everything from before WW2 is already expired and no longer relevant, then that includes the colonization too.

I gave you an example of what Slovenians feel about our history, which included being part of some foreign empire for the vast, VAST majority of Slovenians' presence in this part of the world. Slovenians were also never treated like people in the colonies were, however. The parts that were under Austria benefitted immensely from it (as opposed to the parts that were under Hungary), which is arguably the main reason why we're now so far ahead of e.g. Croatia.

So no, I'm not saying anything has expired. I'm actually saying the opposite - that people themselves know best whether their former masters were a positive or at least a neutral influence or rather murderous oppressors.",European Union,/r/europe/comments/lplyit/italian_ambassador_killed_in_congo_during_kidnap/gojdayi/,LXXXVI,1614133422

2865,"I want to push back on this. Although I can't speak too much about how history would impact - current day standing but I think it's clear that democracy + socially liberal economy is the best way to go forward. 

Take a look at this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPs6tjXsf7M

Which draws a difference between Mexico and US.  

I think it's clear that political democratic system with free economy works best to achieve overall better life for everyone in the country. 


Look at Baltic states and Ukraine. 

All countries broke away from Soviet union at the same time yet addressed corruption and oligarchy differently. You can see the results 30 years later. 

While Baltic states truly started fighting oligarchy and corruption at around 2000s - Ukraine only started doing that after maidan in 2014. 


You can see this in other countries such as Tajikistan - the strongest example of a country which is ruled by a dictator is yet to achieve any improvement for it's people. 


Now what I'm trying to say - yes the countries were exploited as colonies by imperial Europe but I think it should possible for most countries to achieve significant improvement for it's people via social programs, democracy, free economy, education and battling corruption/oligarchy. 


So in the end yes - Europe as a continent has a history of exploitation and colonialism, that is not an argument that rest of the worlds can not grow and catch up to Europe/North America/Certain Asian countries. 

You could argue that for many countries political systems are direct consequence of Europes imperialism which I don't know if I can disagree with. But I don't think it's the case either. I think there are plethora of factors for each unique case and claiming it's fault of Imperialism would be misleading. 

Also I don't think that you can argue that democracy is not necessary for economic prosperity as you could point to an obvious example of china, but I think personally that looking more closely - there are a lot more cracks in the system than you might expect. And while political will in a dictatorship can be directed strongly it has it's drawbacks such as ignoring parts of the peoples lives that would be addressed in democratic systems. 

I also measure the ""success"" of countries by how good and nice the life is for people inside the countries. Not by GDP.

2883,"&gt; That's just kind of strange, that it seems like Eastern Europe made its way from using cash straight to transfers, debit cards and contactless payments

The reason governments and some smaller shops in the US don't want to accept cards is because we do not have the card interchange fee regulated as tightly as the EU does. Across the EU, credit card interchange (the amount banks can charge merchants for processing credit card transactions) is capped at 0.3% of the price. In the US, only interchange on debit card transactions is capped. So accepting a Visa credit card might cost the merchant 2-3% of the purchase in fees. For small businesses on tight margins, this can be a dealbreaker and lead to them being cash-only. For greedy local and state governments, it can lead to them being cash and check only to avoid losing that money.

&gt; using cash straight to transfers

This is a common phenomenon around the world outside of just monetary exchange. Generally speaking, countries or regions that arrive late to a party, so to speak, can leapfrog to whatever the best current technology is when they adopt it. Countries that were early adopters, on the other hand, tend to have created a massive infrastructure using an older technology that becomes entrenched and expensive to upgrade. The US created a nationwide digital financial transfer system in the 1980s-90s that is still used today, but has all the limits of a system designed using 1980s technology. The Single Euro Payments Area, on the other hand, was created in the late 2000s and early 2010s, with full adoption coming in 2014 and instant transfers in 2017. The US would essentially have to start from the ground up to create a comparable system now, so instead a consortium of major banks created a private solution called Zelle for same-day-clearing digital bank-to-bank transfers. A great non-money example of this is average broadband internet speeds in Germany being lower than in many other European countries--Germany set up the backbone of their internet infrastructure before fibre became commonplace and now upgrading in rural areas is an expensive process that no one wants to pay for.",Paris 10eme | US Expat,/r/europe/comments/lqrw16/czech_mate/gojhm5k/,Gwenavere,1614135561

The other doses don't specify that they must be made in the EU, but the contract says the EU can only ask for the optional doses once it has received its initial doses (clause 5.2), and that Astrazeneca only needs to consider requests for additional doses in good faith (clause 5.3).

&gt; Firstly, the production of the vaccine fluid itself which happens at three sites: Oxford Biomedica in Oxfordshire, Cobra Biologics in Staffordshire and the Halix factory in the Netherlands.
&gt; Secondly, the fluid is taken to either a plant in Wrexham, North Wales or a similar one in Germany.  At these sites the mixture is transferred to individual vials on a production line.

I mean we never had a work from home order (as in it being necessary), but since the pandemic began some places (dine in restaurants, gyms, most types of schools etc) have been closed for very long periods of time, some of the longest. And on lockdown measured (in common perception of lockdown) Greece beats most countries.


So while usually UK data (I assume due to source) on covid19 is stellar, this graph is rather bad, as choosing some definition of ""closed workplaces"", as meaning ""lockdown"" they basically promotes the no lockdown agenda, as Norway, Greece and Finland have very good covid19 statistics and Poland and Hungary moderately good during the whole pandemic, and all are listed as no lockdown, while people are having lockdown fatigue...

As a follow Romanian suggested, maybe the reason why the opinion appears to be soo high and different from the polls done by Romanian agency is that the Romanians surveyed were being polite.

The only message from a UK spokesman is that AZ-UK can export to the EU once they have met 100m doses. AZ-UK are bound to the contract under common law. AZ-AB have no such commitment to the EC contract. The UK government has also offered their vaccines to Ireland which the article does not mention.

In reference to this specific statement Politico.eu (which can hardly be classed as pro-UK) have compared the UK/AZ-UK contract and the EC/AZ-AB and have also found that unlike the EC contract AZ-UK are legally bound to this commitment of a specific value to the UK.

It is an interesting read, especially given its source (https://www.politico.eu/article/the-key-differences-between-the-eu-and-uk-astrazeneca-contracts/), the article goes far beyond the butcher shop argument, explains the difference between Belgium law and Common Law, how involved the UK government were in setting up a UK supply chain and supporting AZ-UK.

I've had a friend die from this pandemic so believe me I understand your angst and frustration and worry, but directing all this towards AZ, let's people who are also responsible off the hook. AZ have managed to get things right in the UK with the support of the UK government, they have also managed this in the US with the support of the American government, the same blueprint is now working in India via a third party. The only place that seems to have more issues than most with the supply chain is the operation in the EU. A month ago EC inspectors went to the AZ plant to see these issues and concluded that AZ were correct and their were supply chain issues, the same inspectors said they would monitor the situation, I'd like to know what happened to that monitoring. EC inspectors investigated 3 months worth of customs exports and also found nothing irregular.

3147,"The thing is that the expectations on how many doses AZ could produce where not dictated to them by the EU as we see other suppliers promising later dates and fewer doses. 

That it was easier to produce and handle than the more complicated mRNA vaccines was one of the points constantly mentioned last year. I mean they also said they would've provided 30 million doses to the UK by the end of 2020 and when they didn't they said that this was not a production issue but that they were delaying production on purpose because they did not want to start the shelf life of their product.

They wouldn't have made these promises if they didn't believe they could keep them. 

I think what we see here is the consequences of their bad planing. If the UK had gotten their 30 million doses last year as they had been promised and since the UK has only ordered 100 million doses overall AZ must have thought that they would produce way ahead of the UK's capability to vaccinate their population and so the UK plant was probably seen as the back up for the EU plant and their EU assets would work as the back up for their UK production.

3261,"There is difference between expecting to be bailed, and merely asking a loan which is what Eurostar is asking for. Loan refused on the basis it's ""foreign-owned"". That would be new.

Unless your haulage company was created by a public initiative, which is possible. Most rail services are often backed by State initiative and their operation is often assimilated to a public service. That's why their is often a debate about public operated rail service and private operated rail services. But do remember that the current government did describe border crossing of goods and people a vital need during the recent mess in Kent.

And it would be surprising that this gov is okay to loan to airlines but not an international rail service.

&gt;Eurostar, which is majority-owned by France's state-owned rail company, SNCF, is believed to have tapped into all financial assistance available to them from the French government. But it has received nothing from the British government which has allocated £3.5 billion (€3.93 billion) and £1.8 billion (€2.02 billion) to its domestic railways and commercial aviation respectively.

&gt;In a statement, also issued on Sunday, the company said it is ""encouraged by the government backed loans that have been awarded to airlines and would once again ask that this kind of support be extended to international high-speed rail which has been severely impacted by the pandemic.

&gt;There are only a few nuclear plants being built right now

where? certainly not on a global level.  About 50 power reactors are currently being constructed in 16 countries ! (the demand for uranium will rise accordingly.)

&gt; Right now trees in the Baltics are cut down, shipped to The Netherlands and put in coal plants to burn as ""renewables"" on paper 

and that is the norm? keep your propaganda for yourself. we do no such bullshit in germany. our biogas plants are small, mostly decentralized and deal with mostly local wastes of other already existing production chains. 

problematic scale depends on how close you live to one of the plants. A minor release of radioactive gas can be a major incident if you live close to one.

Of course nuclear is getting in the way of renewables. Nuclear is cheap **on the paper**. We have a liberated, free energy market. Ever heard of that concept? what do you think is the result?

&gt; Clear bullshit and you know it. 

What I know is that every country has only a certain amount of energy it needs. Ergo if you constuct new reactors, how is that contributing to renewable forms of energy production? right, not at all!

&gt; Funny, since a lot of the complaints are saying it is more expensive. 

Funny is your inability to understand how some form of energy is supported indirectly, because the state and the public bear its long term costs. Imaging if the costs of burying and containing the radioactive waste were included in the costs of that energy on the paper? no provider nor citizen could afford it.

A provider of a coal plant for example is responsible to clean and restore the area after surface mining.

3357,"&gt; when the UK government has said in front of the parliement that they were breaking the international law

The UK government might have ""said"" anything. What matters is that the EU actually broke international law (a treaty to which they are not even a signatory, making it even worse) by imposing a hard border in NI, and is breaking international law again regarding ""equivalence"". Not to mention the petty act of banning shellfish from the UK despite guarantees previously to the contrary - not a breach of international law, but certainly a complete disregard for good-faith agreements.

&gt; The equivalence is granted at the discretion of the EU, and you know that without these guarantees the fact that the UK could diverge really soon is a good argument against equivalence.

Another nonsense argument. Equivalence can be withdrawn in as little as 30 days, until the UK diverges, there is no reason to not grant equivalence as the UK has done. And besides, divergence isn't sufficient grounds on which to withdraw equivalence - all of the aforementioned countries that are granted equivalent status by the EU have very different financial regulation frameworks to that of the EU.

&gt; Most of the time, you will bring these differencies to justify that there is no discrimination. Good luck to prove this.

I reckon it's pretty straightforward considering the UK's financial regulations are identical to those of the EU, while none of the nations to which the EU has granted equivalence have identical regulations.

&gt; As we grow up, our minds develop and our bodies develop. A tool for adults should take full advantage of the adult capabilities of both mind and body. Tools that are dumbed down for children's minds or children's bodies are called ""toys"".

3477,"My guess would be that it is based on the administration of each empire at the time of the war. Not separating Ireland appears to show some consistency? Most likely based upon the military administration.

Irish were recruited/conscripted to the British Army, Indians to the separate British Indian Army. Finns were recruited/conscripted to the Imperial Russian Army, as the Grand Duchy's military was dissolved in 1901.

The UK ran and considered the British Isles very differently to the overseas colonies. Though Ireland for a long time was run by the Colonial Office, at this time it was considered integral. Russia however seems to have been more of a ""unitary"" empire by the time of WW1, and ran it's own colonies as integral parts of the state, with the intention of complete assimilation.

I am aware that Finland had more autonomy than much of the rest of the Russian empire. But ""Russification"" policies were applied to some degree in the Grand Duchy, especially as time progressed, which makes it seem (to me) like the autonomy for Finland was a temporary measure to avoid revolt, and later Tsars intended to make Finland an integral part of Russia, similar to the UK with Ireland.

So the UK drew a more distinct line between the ""homeland"" and the colonies than Russia did, except with Ireland. That is the only way I can imagine that the distinction was decided upon.",,/r/europe/comments/lqfw1z/ottoman_empire_and_serbia_big_oof/gogl1yf/,RedPaddleRed,1614088896

After Soviet Unions end Ukraine turned to the West and is applying for membership in the NATO which is a defence alliance against the SU.

For instance, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogdanovka

&gt; In December 1941, a few cases of typhus, which is a disease spread by lice and fleas, broke out in the camp.[1] A decision was made by the German adviser to the Romanian administration of the district, and the Romanian District Commissioner to murder all the inmates. The Aktion began on December 21, and was carried out by Romanian soldiers, gendarmes, Ukrainian police, civilians from Golta,[2] and local ethnic Germans under the commander of the Ukrainian regular police, Kazachievici. Thousands of disabled and ill inmates were forced into two locked stables, which were doused with kerosene and set ablaze, burning alive all those inside. Other inmates were led in groups to a ravine in a nearby forest and shot in their necks. The remaining Jews dug pits with their bare hands in the bitter cold, and packed them with frozen corpses. Thousands of Jews froze to death. A break was made for Christmas, but the killing resumed on December 28. By December 31, over 40,000 Jews had been killed.[3]",Romania,/r/europe/comments/lqdmcu/population_killed_in_wwii/gog1qta/,anarchisto,1614074555

20-30 years ago, there’d be snow here in winter. December-February, usually not continuously (Christmas actually rarely had snow, weirdly enough). After that, we’d have nice weather. Summers were warm, but heatwaves were rare.

In the past 10 years, we’ve had at most a week of snow here or there. The last 2 years not even 3 days. The times there was snow, like last week, it was intense. It was a sudden cold snap that made temperatures drop drastically. The suddenness of that change means that many people are caught unprepared, so they can’t protect their devices, their water pipes, sometimes their animals. It causes damage to our homes.

In the meantime, the last 4 years have had very hot summers. The summer of 2018 was without rain for 8 weeks. It got very dry. It was a near-constant heatwave. Heatwaves also were common the few years before and after that. Nature reserves caught on fire. Lots of elderly and sick people died from the heat. Lots of animals died from the heat. This was rare when I was little. It isn’t rare now.

The climate has always changed without human assistance. That change has been slow and gradual. You can prepare for it across generations of time. With human assistance, it has been changing faster. We can see it within a generation. We can’t prepare for the changes fast enough.

It’s nice weather right now, and winter seems to be over. If humanity as a whole doesn’t minimize its effects on climate change, then within a generation we will not have nice weather when winter is over.",,/r/europe/comments/lpsk6z/temperature_map_of_europe_22022021/gofub1e/,AlwaysBeQuestioning,1614067533

3936,"You're conflating 'money' with 'resources.' The problem is not that citizens in severely underdeveloped countries don't have money to buy food or medicine or whatnot, it's that there is no food. There is no access to local or global markets to acquire food. Foreign aid involves delivering these goods and services that simply don't exist within the country. Without a stable government, factional warlords forcibly take the food to feed their own while starving out their rival factions. Just giving people money in these situations does nothing. When we say we're giving $100M in aid to a country like The DRC, it's really just summing up $40M in wheat, $20M beans, $20M in medicine, etc, the actual dollar value is just to give an idea of the amount that's being sent. This isn't the case in developed countries with stable currencies and functioning markets, as if the EU gives Croatia $100M in aid they're free to buy on the world markets whatever the equivalent amount of goods is, which may or may not be bookmarked for specific causes.",,/r/europe/comments/lplyit/italian_ambassador_killed_in_congo_during_kidnap/gofdgar/,reddev87,1614055326

4178,"""As flights of political fancy go, Boris Johnson’s desire to build a tunnel between Great Britain and Northern Ireland might seem to be one of the most audacious.

However, Whitehall officials have revealed that one version of the plan worked up in Downing Street went even further, envisaging not one but three tunnels under the Irish Sea connecting in an “underground roundabout” beneath the Isle of Man.

No 10 officials given the task of examining how Johnson’s blue-sky thinking might be feasible quickly concluded that the original plan of a link between Stranraer in Scotland and Larne in Northern Ireland was impractical.

Stranraer has poor transport links and it would cost billions to build a high-speed rail link to connect the tunnel terminus with the rest of Britain. “It would have cost just as much to put in 100 miles of high-speed rail to get even to Carlisle as it would to dig the tunnel,” claimed one source familiar with the deliberations.

Instead officials proposed three starting points: at Stranraer, Heysham, near Lancaster, and one near Liverpool. “The idea was that these three tunnels would meet in a giant roundabout underneath the Isle of Man and the tunnel to Ireland would start there,” the source said. “Everyone knows Boris wants to do this so people were asked to look at how.”

That route would mean the tunnel was built south of Beaufort’s Dyke — a 32-mile fissure that was used to dump an estimated 1.5 million tons of Second World War munitions — which gets in the way of a direct route between Stranraer and Larne.

A second source suggested that the plan for Douglas Junction was designed to “highlight how nuts this whole thing is”. The tunnel scheme is regarded as “bat\*\*\*\*” by several of Johnson’s senior aides.

However, in private they acknowledge that it is a “Fuhrer bunker project”, so beloved of the prime minister that it “cannot die”.

“Just as Hitler moved around imaginary armies in the dying days of the Third Reich, so the No 10 policy unit is condemned to keep looking at this idea, which exists primarily in the mind of the PM,” one informed source said. “The roundabout is round the bend.”

Nonetheless a formal proposal for a single tunnel has been submitted by the High-Speed Rail Group, an umbrella organisation for rail companies, to a review by Sir Peter Hendy, the chairman of Network Rail, which is supposed to find ways of improving transport links between the different parts of the UK.

Hendy, who ran Transport for London when Johnson was mayor, could give the green light for a feasibility study into the plan in the next few weeks.

“People think this is all a joke but it’s much more likely to get the go-ahead than people think,” another Whitehall official said.""",Ex-Brexiteer,/r/europe/comments/lq475p/boris_considered_building_a_giant_roundabout/goeiluo/,croma0910,1614039510

4186,"Your example of a country whose problems aren't colonial is a country that exists *only* because of colonialism. Nigeria is not a country that existed before the British Empire created it. The point of Calabar wanting independence and not wanting to leave the British Empire is self-explanatory. Calabar benefitted massively from being part of the Empire whilst other parts of the region suffered.

Following Nigerian independence, there were deep religious and ethnic divides *created by colonialism*. The series of the coups following independence leave a legacy in Nigeria still seen today. 

It is impossible to look at Nigeria as a state entity, nor its people, without analysisng the historical events that led to its existence.

This extract by Attahiru Jega in the book, *Identity Transformation
and Identity Politics
under Structural Adjustment in
Nigeria*, explains it well.

&gt;Identities have historically been significant in the Nigerian political process,
under colonial rule as well as in the post-colonial dispensation. Under colonialism, administrative exigencies warranted “the invention of traditions”,
and the nurturing and exacerbation of an “us” versus “them” syndrome:
Muslim versus Christian; Northerner versus Southerner; Hausa-Fulani versus
Yoruba versus Igbo, and so on. Religious, regional and ethnic differences
were given prominence in conceiving and implementing social, educational
and economic development policies and projects under the indirect system
of colonial administration favoured by the British. Thus, the differential impact of colonialism set the context of the regional educational, economic
and political imbalances which later became significant in the mobilisation
or manipulation of identity consciousness in order to effectively divide and
rule, as well as in the politics of decolonisation and in the arena of competitive politics in the post-colonial era. For example, the differential impact of
colonial education policies ensured that the Northern region was educationally backward relative to the Southern region. Similarly, the differential impact of colonial economic policies ensured that the Southern region,
especially the Lagos seaport area, was relatively more advanced economically than the Northern region, while Southern cities became the hub of the
country’s commercial and industrial activities. The differential political impact came about as a result of the deliberate colonial political policy which
used population as a criterion for representation to give the Northern region
a greater chance of controlling political power nationally as a counterveiling
factor to Southern economic and educational dominance. The end-result
was that the political elite in the Northern region capitalised on fears of
domination by the Southerners, in view of their region’s economic and educational disadvantages, to mobilise a Northern identity to ensure control of
political power with which they hoped to check-mate the perceived threat
of Southern domination. On the other hand, the Southern elite detested
“the use of numbers” for perpetual control of political power by the Northern elite despite the economic and educational backwardness of the Northern region, and felt aggrieved by the inverse relationship between political
power and socio-economic advancement. Hence, they also mobilised a
Southern identity to oppose and struggle against a perceived injustice in the
national power equation. However, the mobilisation of a Southern identity
seemed ineffective compared to that of a Northern identity largely because
of the different competing ethnic compositions in the western and eastern parts of Southern Nigeria.

There are several further important points, which the book goes into detail explaining, which are impossible to ignore. But the following points raised show why it is impossible to think that colonialism plays *no part* in the current conditions of Nigeria:

- Nigeria as a state only existed following the amalgamation of several British protectorates that had been divided politically, culturally, ethnically, and economically.

- The Nigerian economy was still governed largely by foreign interests following independence, rather than by indigenous interests.

- Manufacturing remained controlled by foreign capital following independence, rather than indigenous capital.

- The current identities of the peoples of Nigeria existed as a product of colonialism.

- The North-South divide which has been prominent in post-colonial Nigeria was created by colonialism. 

- The military coups in late 20th century can be directly attributed to the legacy of colonialism.",,/r/europe/comments/lplyit/italian_ambassador_killed_in_congo_during_kidnap/goeiwqr/,FireZeLazer,1614039660

You can spend a couple of thousand francs for the general railcard that let's you use almost any public transport without additional charge (apart from class upgrades) - if you are a frequent traveller and commuter it's worth it. There's also the half-fare railcard for up to CHF 180, that allows you to purchase train tickets for half the price.
So overall it's not the cheapest system, but you can get around for a lot cheaper than some people think.

&gt;Islam is a very right-wing ideology. Leftists are being manipulated by Muslims, not the other way around.  
&gt;  
&gt;I think Islam is more dangerous than leftist ideas.

Well yes. At it's core, Islam advocates for individual freedom, personal property and respect for other people and peace. I don't really think you can pin-point Islam as being right-wing or left-wing,

But political islamism is highly leftist and marxist. The original founders and ideologues of the Muslim Brotherhood, which are closely allied to the western left, were and still are heavily inspired by Socialism. It's not really about who is being manipulated by who.

The islamists and the leftists have very similar ideologies and goals. They're joined at the hips.

4311,"It's about time France does something about its problem with radical Islam. The fact most Muslims took more offense towards the depictions of their prophet than to the beheading of a man, shows the kind of problem and intolerance in their communities, and it's negatively affecting France and the progressive side of it. Don't really know what they mean by Islamo-leftism but it is definitely ironic and extremely weird to see most leftists support Islam, when it goes against all they supposedly believe. We can't side with people that think beheading someone for a picture is not just ok, but encouraged, what kind of world are we creating?

But there's no way France will be able to reverse and fix the problem. I honestly think that they're too far gone. The only way is to go the route Christianity took, with reformation and rejecting those kind of acts. We can't forget Christian countries did the same shit, killing for offending the religion, being intolerant to those that didn't fit what the church deemed right. Until not too long ago, gay marriage was illegal in France, and most Christian countries (still is in some), but we managed to look past religion and focus on the individual.

And speaking of Turkish economy: Its economy is in a VERY bad shape, and completely relies on EU. Another reason why they wouldn't dare start a war against a member of the European Union. Turkey would basically be broke within a few days. At least Greece has the Eurozone on its site.

And in case of war. Turkish warships would sink faster than you might think. Manpower doesn't mean shit if you don't have any ships anymore.

Greece has enough submarines roaming under the Aegean, and a net centric warfare that shields the entire Aegean.

Building your own warship doesn't really matter in a war. They sink as good as any other ship.

4352,"&gt;I only remember because so felt fairly stupid and had to Google what a fintech was last time.

Well fintech companies are just startups in financial sector which offer services traditionally provided by banks (or other like brokers)

for example mentioned in article Revolut started with much better withdrawal currency exchange rates and fees from ATMs in foreign countries than traditional banks, though since then it expanded to offering other financial services

&gt;I wonder why they're all leaving whist other financial institutions are planning on moving in to London

That's actually slightly different, when UK was part of EU companies could provide services without having physical offices in UK or vice versa, now when UK is out, UK companies are establishing offices in EU, while EU companies establishing offices in UK

it is not clear yet what effects will be due such movement on London, but considering UK exports more services than it imports it probably will be net negative

&gt;Is the regulation different for fintechs and are they already fairly well represented in Lithuania?

Since 2016 Lithuanian central bank easied banking license requirements for fintechs, easied regulatory demands for fintechs, created regulatory sandbox for fintechs to test their ideas out and other. Considering that just in 4 years Lithuania has more fintech startups than Germany and France combined I think it worked decently well",Quo vadis?,/r/europe/comments/lpr4gv/uk_fintechs_seek_cure_for_brexit_in_lithuania/godlg3v/,ricka_lynx,1614024186

It was hot and trains at the time didn't have AC, just some crappy ventilation.

First they stopped in the middle of nowhere about 20 km from Bucharest, for about 1 hour. Then they started moving and after about one hour of somewhat decent speed they slowed down to about 20 kmph. We were joking that ants were faster.

We arrived in Constanța after 7 (seven!) hours. So average speed of what, maybe 30 kmph?

I think things have improved, I guess the average speed is maybe 80 kmph these days.

&gt;Take apple, they update the iphone each year with processors so fast no one has need for on a phone and camera's so good improvements become undetectable with the human eye but what is the next iphone? They do not have homegrown competition really only international (samsung and Huawei).  But they control the platforms e.g. appstores or cloud computer which gives them power over all other tech systems. No access = no market = our version wins.

So is Apple just a monopolist rent seeking company, or are they constantly improving their product to stay on top? 

It’s certainly HARDER to be a disruptive company when you’re already big. That’s doesn’t mean they’re not innovating anymore and are just rent seeking monopolies.

4579,"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_trade_debate

Essentially it boils down to - 

Farmers are unable to sell all their grow as ‘fair trade certified’ because buyers aren’t willing to pay the marked-up price for all of their crops, on average ‘fair trade’ growers only sell about 18-37% of their grows as ‘fair trade certified’. On top of this, growing as fair trade certified incurs additional production costs as well as them charging a licensing fee. There’s also issues around how much of the extra money that people pay for fair trade products actually goes towards the farmers who actually need it, some estimates that put it as low as 5%. 

Fair trade products can also destabilise local economies, encourage overproduction, and are basically only targeted at the ‘middle class’ of farmers to begin with. To qualify for fair trade certification you have to pass a bunch of quality and political standards, which sounds fine in theory but the farms capable of passing those standards are generally already run by educated people who can afford to ensure a high quality product, so the whole idea of ‘helping the poorest farmers’ doesn’t really fit because the poorest farmers can’t qualify for fair trade certification. 

I recommend reading the Wikipedia page for more details. This is still a really hotly debated issue and I don’t really know enough about it to fully come down on the ‘fuck fair trade’ side, but I do know that the general perception that ‘fair trade good, all the time’ is wrong.",Earth,/r/europe/comments/lplyit/italian_ambassador_killed_in_congo_during_kidnap/gocnqtk/,SirEbralPaulsay,1614009691

4602,"So, the presidential elections in 2023 are still quite some time away. We do have some first indications about who's paving their way to the ballot though. 

From DISY's side, it's likely that Haris Georgiadis (former MinFin for Anastasiadis) is going to be the candidate. He comes from the more hardcore wing of DISY, which means laissez-faire economics and a more conservative social outlook. When it comes to the Cyprus Issue, he made some vague comments about the need to explore non-reunification approaches to a solution, which are open to interpretation (quasi-confederation? quasi-two state? He did not clarify). In a run-off election, he will probably have the backing of DIPA explicitly and ELAM implicitly. 

It also looks like human rights lawyer Achilleas Demetriadis may be itching to run. He is a moderate centrist with acceptance/good-will from the centre-left. He is known from bringing a lot of cases against Turkey at the European Court of Human Rights, with regards to the loss of use of Greek Cypriot properties in the north of Cyprus. If he is in charge, it's unlikely that he will shake the consensus-based mixed economic system towards either direction but he may be more socially progressive, or at least use much softer rhetoric. On the Cyprus Issue, if nothing changes dramatically until then, he will definitely support the UN-based process for a Bicommunal Bizonal Federation and all the previously achieved convergences. He will most probably run an independent candidate on paper, but with the explicit support of DIKO (centrist) and AKEL (left-wing). In a run-off election, and if the parties will continue to exist until then, he will also likely have the support of ANEX explicitly, and a non-trivial share of KOSP voters (who typically do not explicitly support any other candidate in run-offs). EDEK will probably not exist in 2023.

There's no indication as to who the other challengers for the first round will be. The Lillikas moment (SYMPOL, social liberals) seems to have passed. ELAM (ultra-right) will have a first-round candidate, probably the current leader Chr. Christou. ANEX (conservative socially, left-ish populism economically) may also run with their leader, currently Anna Theologou. None of them have the potential of going to the second round as things stand.",Cyprus,/r/europe/comments/lpkk32/cyprus_voter_intentions_poll_legislatives_2021/goc8nxf/,agrammatic,1614001974

 and this shit is in the UK, just not as extreme, it's in Australia, it is fully in Alberta Canada, it's in parts of Canada,  reality is under attack from the right wing across the planet with funds from Russia and half of American Culture dedicated to a fascist cult and the ENTIRE media so used to legitimizing them, the cult, that they let them do anything and say anything

""sunshine is rain technically, it's all just weather so is it a lie? what about her emails""

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goma

&gt;Goma is the capital of North Kivu province in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Looking at themap there, Goma is basically on the eastern border of the DRC.

https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker/conflict/violence-democratic-republic-congo

&gt;Tshisekedi inherited a number of crises across the DRC, including an Ebola outbreak in the east and ongoing violence across the country, particularly in the Ituri, Kasai, and Kivu regions. More than one hundred armed groups, such as the Ugandan Allied Democratic Forces, are believed to operate in the eastern region of the DRC. Despite the presence of more than sixteen thousand UN peacekeepers, these groups continue to terrorize communities and control weakly governed areas. Millions of civilians have been forced to flee the fighting: the United Nations estimates there are currently 4.5 million internally displaced persons in the DRC, and more than 800,000 DRC refugees in other nations.

-

&gt;The origins of the current violence in the DRC are in the massive refugee crisis and spillover from the 1994 genocide in Rwanda. After Hutu génocidaires fled to eastern DRC and formed armed groups, opposing Tutsi and other opportunistic rebel groups arose. The Congolese government was unable to control and defeat the various armed groups, some of which directly threatened populations in neighboring countries, and war eventually broke out.
&gt;
&gt;From 1998 to 2003, government forces supported by Angola, Namibia, and Zimbabwe fought rebels backed by Rwanda and Uganda in what is known as the Second Congo War. While estimates vary greatly, the death toll may have reached over three million people. Despite a peace deal in 2002 and the formation of a transitional government in 2003, ongoing violence perpetrated by armed groups against civilians in the eastern region has continued, largely due to poor governance, weak institutions, and rampant corruption. 

-

&gt;Weak governance and the prevalence of many armed groups have subjected Congolese civilians to widespread rape and sexual violence, massive human rights violations, and extreme poverty. The African Union, United Nations, and neighboring countries have struggled to address threats posed by rebel groups and promote sustainable development.

&gt;GENEVA - The lives and futures of more than three million displaced children in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo are being threatened by armed militia groups, the U.N. Children's Fund warns. 
&gt;
&gt;Official U.N. data confirm 91 children were killed in eastern Congo's Ituri province between January and August of 2020, but UNICEF says it believes the actual number is much higher. 
&gt;
&gt;Speaking on a video link from Kinshasa, the UNICEF representative in the Congo, Edouard Beigbeder, says millions of men, women and children are living in a climate of insecurity in the most violence-afflicted provinces of Ituri, North Kivu, South Kivu and Tanganyika.  
&gt;
&gt;He says children are particularly vulnerable. 
&gt;
&gt;""Thousands of children are trapped within armed groups or subjected to sexual violence and forced labor,"" Beigbeder said. ""There was a 16 percent increase in the recruitment of children as militia fighters in the first six months of 2020 compared to 2019."" 
&gt;
&gt;In the first half of last year, UNICEF says an estimated 4,000 children were recruited into armed groups in Ituri alone. 
&gt;
&gt;Eastern Congo has been plagued by chaos and violence for years, most of it stemming from political rivalries, fighting that involves various rebel groups, and struggles over natural resources. ",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/lpmphd/photo_the_italian_ambassador_to_the_congo_luca/goc918q/,duisThias,1614002181

The problem is that PIS is supported by the Catholic church, controls the narrative in national TV and Radio and has a fanatical following among some of the Poles, which is partially based on conspiracy theory. Some of their voters are basically a cult. But many others who don't speak any foreign languages are easily manipulated in to believing that western countries are failing because of multiculturalism and LGBT rights.

Second, GDP PPA is actually pointless because GDP doesn't measure purchasing power and nominal GDP already takes costs into account. After all, GDP measures the value of goods and services produced within a country, so it makes no sense to just change the value of these goods based on an arbitrary comparison with the US. Additionally, PPP changes even within countries with the same currency, and you can remove the exchange effects just by using real GDP at constant prices.

PPP, aka poor people's parity, is a shit metric that gives way to all sorts of distortion. According to PPA, the current GDP per capita of Latvia is almost the same as Denmark's or the Netherlands' in the 1990s.

The reason is because Russia has second biggest nuclear arsenal, which allows them to act with impunity.

4950,"""So why do the manufacturer's specifications require a second dose then?""

Initially it was to maintain and increase the level of 76% efficiency against mild to moderate symptoms due to the result from the lab trials showing that the effectiveness may decrease over time without it (like all vaccines). However since then, as in the article I have shared with you, the data shows a single dose does provide 100% against severe illness, hospitalisation and death. 

It now seems to be the case that even after 3 months with a single dose the efficiency remains at the same level or increases. 

So in answer to your question as far as I can make out from the data and most recently studies the only reason to need a second dose at the 3 month interval (WHO recommendations) is that it will increase efficiency against mild symptoms from 76% to an average of 82% (in the study some people increase to 92%). Again these figures are all against mild symptoms, to reiterate AZ provides 100% against severe illness, hospitalisation and death after a single dose.",,/r/europe/comments/lp5o9x/costs_are_rising_exponentially_for_europes/gobjoa8/,Former_Singer,1613981525

Do you listen to yourself?

Obviously there was a calculated decision that allowing for a limited Christmas was made (and was a good one when made in November based on the information available at the time). By your argument then allowing anyone to do anything is wrong ‘cuz corona doesn’t take any days off’ Open schools? Nope - corona isn’t banned from school grounds is it! How about hospitals? Nope. With all of these decisions there’s a risk/reward calculation (obviously) and to try and reduce it down to ‘doing anything is bad cuz corona’ is patently ridiculous.

I don’t think it was many days. Broadly speaking many of us were expecting it a couple of days before the announcement but if that time was taken to recheck the information and confirm the decision then that’s fine.

This is simply untrue and I have to  believe it is genuine ignorance on your part otherwise it is a self-serving lie. 20+ EU countries have not wanted Nordstream2 from the start. Germany simply used it's economic might and strong influence in the EU to ignore any opposition voices. 

https://www.ft.com/content/4875c9ff-0868-3798-8f66-4efa667eb5ba

Power in Europe speaks with a German accent. With the UK at the exit door of the EU and France still economically weak Germany is uncomfortably dominant. The latest example of this is the plan for the new Nord Stream 2 pipeline which will bring natural gas from Russia across the Baltic to the North German coast and then onwards to Central and Western Europe.

The question is how Germany will use its power.

Thirteen EU member states have protested against the Nord Stream project, saying it will divert trade and transit revenues away from them and increase European dependence on Russian gas for decades to come. The protesting states want the European Commission to take control of negotiations of the project away from Germany and to set gas trade in the context of the Energy Union – a concept agreed in 2014 but never implemented.

The Energy Union was designed to diversify sources of supply and build pan European infrastructure in the interests of security of supply. Most of the 13 are former members of the Soviet bloc and remain overwhelmingly dependent on Russia for supplies of both gas and electricity provided through grids built in the Comecon era.

In the words of the former Polish Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek, now Chair of the Industry Committee of the European Parliament, Nord Stream 2 and the Energy Union cannot coexist.

At the same time the US Senate, by a majority of 97 to 2 agreed three weeks ago to impose sanctions on companies involved in funding Russian export pipeline projects – the latest in a series of steps designed to use Russian economic interests as leverage over Kremlin policy on Ukraine.

In Berlin the official line is that Nord Stream 2 is just a straightforward commercial venture in which neither the EU or the US should interfere. The $10bn project not only cements the sensitive relationship between Germany and Russia but also establishes Germany as an entrepot in the European gas market, replacing the declining gas production from the Dutch and British sectors of the North Sea.

Seen from Russia the logic of Nord Stream 2 is clear.

The country remains dependent on oil and gas revenue which provided, even with low prices, almost half of its total export revenues in 2016. With the oil price beyond control, Russia has every incentive to maximise its revenue from gas sales and to maintain its share of the European gas market by whatever means.

From a European perspective the benefits are far less clear.

If built Nord Stream 2 will entrench Russian dominance of the European market. Russia currently supplies 34 per cent of European gas. With Nord Stream 2 that will rise perhaps to more than 40 per cent. The project destroys the concept of diversifying supplies.

There are numerous potential sources of supply, some of which could have provided much needed revenue to Europe’s neighbours across the Mediterranean such as Algeria and Libya where stabilisation through economic development is necessary to halt the flow of refugees.

With Nord Stream 2 in place Russia will be able to divert gas trade away from Ukraine, reducing the country’s income from transit fees and making Ukraine ever more dependent on EU subsidies. Even if a short term offer is made to cushion the impact of Nord Stream 2 on Ukraine, the longer term threat will remain.

Of course, Germany has the power to push aside the objections of the smaller European states. Berlin can impose any decision it wants on Brussels. But to press ahead and force the project through would have consequences.

The latest results from the fascinating Pew study of international opinion show that Germany is regarded as having too much power in Europe already – particularly in Southern Europe where Mrs Merkel is blamed for imposing unending austerity.

In Germany itself Nord Stream 2 is seen as the creation of the Social Democratic party – and in particular the former German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder who just happens to be the chairman of the project. Mrs Merkel would lose little by allowing the project to stall and would win respect in the serious parts of the US administration and Congress who are looking for support against Russian behaviour in Ukraine and Syria and alleged Russian interference in the US election.

A political solution would be to allow Nord Stream 2 to fall into the hands of the European Commission lawyers who could find good reasons for not proceeding – many of them set out in some excellent recent articles by Professor Alan Riley.

The gas would not be missed.

Indigenous supplies are certainly declining but demand for gas is also falling – 12.5% down across the EU over the last decade according to the latest BP Statistical Review. Surging renewable supplies could push gas demand down further in the future. With a global gas glut European importers could sign long term deals with suppliers from around the world.

Nord Stream 2 is anything but a simple commercial project. What happens next matters for Russia and for the US. But most significant of all is what is what the decision on Nord Stream 2 will tell us about how Germany intends to handle its economic and political dominance of Europe.",Devon,/r/europe/comments/lpfmhj/nord_stream_2_has_damaged_the_west_enough_time_to/gob9lj2/,DrunkenTypist,1613973375

Not feeling personally invested in either, I don't have a problem putting the interventionist activities of the EU alongside those of Russia. In fact it feels obvious that they should be discussed together. 

When I was a kid I remember folk saying ""people in glass houses shouldn't throw stones"" but now I'm older I find you CAN throw stones -- crying ""that's whataboutism!"" will protect your panes from the rejoinder! This cry seems designed to mute dialectical discussion. (Ironically, isn't the origin of this term, whataboutism, in Soviet Russia or have I misremembered?)

If your first response to something is ""that's whataboutism!"" I advise pausing for a sec. If you're on the side of Justice there should be a better response available. You should be able to explain the reasons for whatever you are being presented with. I tend to suspect the term ""whataboutism"" is thrown out when the speaker has a bare cupboard.

If we are worried about each other in our community we should worry about the state of our institutions. Especially under covid, but before that too, our institutions have been flagging. From conversations, even with political normies, I hear doubt raised more often than before. When companies are kept open so workers can get infected on the production line, when the EU nations struggle to show solidarity and agree on mutual aid, even with such a powerful resource as the ECB, Europeans ask, wait, are we the good guys or not?

5043,"The cold logic is that if nukes are hitting UK or FR then it’s almost certain that orders of magnitude more nukes will already be flying between the superpowers. In that scenario the greater good is to think in terms of the post-apocalyptic survival of the country, and the first step toward that goal is to avoid becoming a target of future waves of nukes that might target currently undamaged cities. 

In other words, the small players will always choose to keep their heads down and hope that by not retaliating they’ll stay low on the target priority list for future waves. A few days later when the nukes have stopped flying, and the survivors look at their intact cities, no one in the UK or FR will care that their handful of nukes were launched. 

In fact, one of the reasons submarine launched nukes are favoured by FR and UK is that it drops the actual country lower on the target priority lists because there aren’t any land-based launchers, so the first wave of nukes will have ‘only’ targeted command &amp; control and military airfields (though even that is questionable).  Minimising land targets is very important for UK and FR - after all, the superpowers would barely notice if an area of their own countries the size of FR turned to glass, but that’s an entirely different proposition for FR and UK.",,/r/europe/comments/lpd786/how_do_you_see_a_first_use_policy/gobc27o/,ShootingPains,1613975241

5243,"I'm not going to argue that closing borders or not closing borders is right, but to address a few criticisms in the article of the border closures:

&gt;Last spring we had 17 different member states that had introduced border measures and the lessons we learned at the time is that it did not stop the virus but it disrupted incredibly the single market and caused enormous problems,” the commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, told the news media this week. “The virus taught us that closing borders does not stop it.”

* I am pretty sure that no EU member, aside from maybe members isolating already-isolated communities like islands, has any real hope at this point of *stopping* a variant's spread.  Rather, the aim would be buying time.  The more people that are in high-risk groups and get vaccinated before the virus gets in, the fewer peope die.

* AFAICT, the restrictions here all take into consideration transport of goods.  I think that the major issue earlier was holdup of goods transport.  Whether these pay off or not, I do think that there's some experience in what works and what doesn't there.

The article talks about a broader risk to the Schengen Area.  While I don't know the politics here, I'm skeptical that there is a fundamental risk to Schengen.

In the case of the migrant crisis, it wasn't clear  to what extent and degree migrant movement would be curtailed.

In the case of COVID-19, we've a pretty good timeline for the vaccination program.  We know that it's gonna end and that things are gonna open up probably prior to that.

If it causes lasting harm, it might be in businesses being less-willing to hire across borders or do business across borders in the event of a new crisis.  But I think that severe epidemics are infrequent enough, the potential political changes down the line (e.g. further integration) significant enough, and predicting the exact impact hard enough (e.g. Tyrolian borders going up internal to Austria was probably not on anyone's radar) that the impact is likely limited.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/lp9esu/virus_variants_deliver_fresh_blow_to_europes_open/goaprgq/,duisThias,1613961429

&gt;Main article: Turkish settlers in Northern Cyprus
As a result of the Turkish invasion, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe stated that the demographic structure of the island has been continuously modified as a result of the deliberate policies of the Turks. Following the occupation of Northern Cyprus, civilian settlers from Turkey began arriving on the island. Despite the lack of consensus on the exact figures, all parties concerned admitted that Turkish nationals began arriving in the northern part of the island in 1975.[158] It was suggested that over 120,000 settlers came to Cyprus from mainland Turkey.[158][dead link] This was a violation of the Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, which prohibits an occupier from transferring or deporting parts of its own civilian population into an occupied territory.[159]

&gt;UN Resolution 1987/19 (1987) of the ""Sub-Commission On Prevention Of Discrimination And Protection Of Minorities"", which was adopted on 2 September 1987, demanded ""the full restoration of all human rights to the whole population of Cyprus, including the freedom of movement, the freedom of settlement and the right to property"" and also expressed ""its concern also at the policy and practice of the implantation of settlers in the occupied territories of Cyprus which constitute a form of colonialism and attempt to change illegally the demographic structure of Cyprus.""

It may still be a concern, but 1.4 billion people is a pretty big chunk of the world's population.

Same kind of thing as when we talk about language on here.  Why are Icelanders more-willing to pick up English than the French?  The payoff, the increase in access to other people and things, is relatively-larger for Iceland than France.

If you speak French, you can talk to about 277 million people.

If you speak Icelandic, you can talk to about 0.3 million other people in the world.

If you speak English, you can talk to about 1,268 million people.

A francophone who learns English increases the size of the population that he can interact with by a factor of 4.6.

An Icelandic speaker who learns English increases the scope of what he has access to by a factor of 4,226.  That's a much bigger win.

If you're China, you've got a domestic market of 1.4 billion people already.  If you block something from the outside world out, you can already likely manage to have something somewhat comparable.

Wait a sec. You've started it by accusing /r/russia and its followers and now, when I do the same to /r/europe you're backing down? You, mister, are quite a hypocrite, aren't you? 

And I do talk about public media. But not just some random media. I talk about media approved by moderators of this subreddit. Which, as I wrote before, has a blacklist of untrustworthy media.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;random people might comment it, so it doesn't say much

But when some random people post some random video about your country - that's the whole other story, isn't it?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I've always wondered, with Russia going with the ""the West is not better than us in any way"" mentality

Always - it's for about a decade? That's some unique definition of 'always'. Because before that 'The West' ™ has been seen as a totally the best place to be. And the US in particular... something like Haven, but 10 times better. I kid you not, I've heard stories about how it wonderful there. Like how cars, houses and all other stuff is so affordable ('Не то что в вашей рашке' ™). How a homeless person in the US has stylish haircut, latest iPhone and a great pair of jeans, and he's practically just choose to live a free life. How... you get the gist, don't you?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Are there even any values Russia stands for

I'm not sure if you've noticed, but the USSR is no more. We are as much capitalist as the next country. So we stand for wat's more profitable. Oligarchs play their game, other people live on their own. It might surprise you, but an ordinary Russian doesn't start each morning with a mandatory prayer to Our Lord and Savior Putin.

From the WP article:

&gt;Throughout the war, the Chetnik movement remained mostly inactive against the occupation forces, and increasingly collaborated with the Axis, eventually losing its international recognition as the Yugoslav resistance force. After a brief initial period of cooperation, the Partisans and the Chetniks quickly started fighting against each other. Gradually, the Chetniks ended up primarily fighting the Partisans instead of the occupation forces, and started cooperating with the Axis in a struggle to destroy the Partisans, receiving increasing amounts of logistical assistance.

Check out Myanmar/Bangladesh and Nicaragua/Colombia cases where although the law openly states that islands have full EEZ, the end result was delimitation of island eez with respect to the mainland's equidistance line. Exemplary cases like these are often quite the powerful arguments just as a law is.

5756,"&gt; The Church exists to promote moral behavior 

No, it exists mainly to spread the word of God.   
I'd also say they aren't doing a very good job then.

&gt;Pride parades in western countries are hardly  anything more than perverted trash. Man walk around almost completely  naked holding sex toys and simulating sex acts. 

XD  
Just so you know, most if not all pictures from these ""parades"" are actually BDSM parades. BDSM =/= LGBT. And in these BDSM parades, there are a lot of straight people.

&gt;Not to mention many pro LGBT people believe that a small child should  be able to change it's gender regardless of the fact that it is nowhere  near old enough to make decisions and in most cases it is manipulated to  do so by it's parents. 

Source about this ""manipulation""? While okay, I can understand it can happen, but mostly it's exaggerated by right wing people.  
Also, I had my first gay crushes when I was 10. I tried to fight it because ""church said it's bad"" for most of my teenage years, and now finally I came to the conclusion that yes, I'm LGBT. If I could knew my romantic attraction at such a young age, I can sympathize with trans people who probably feel the same. Trans people I know also started to realize early in childhood that they aren't cis, so who knows, maybe these children you talk about are sincere too.  
Also isn't gender surgery only allowed after you're an adult and when you're a teen you first only get hormone blockers that don't do anything to your body, only stopping puberty, and when you stop taking them you resume puberty, and later if doctor's diagnosis is the same you get the right hormones? Correct me if I'm wrong, but that's what I remember.  


&gt;And even the very concept of pride parades,  people flaunting their sexuality in front of everyone regardless of if  they want or don't want to see it. 

Believe me, as someone on asexual spectrum, in the ideal world I'd love to not see any sexuality in public, be it homo or hetero. But it's not, and I have to see heterosexuality everywhere. Why it's suddenly bad if gay people show the world they're gay if heterosexuals do it all the time?

&gt; Your problem is that you have so much contempt for them that you can't  see there is a reason they oppose the LGBT. And no, they aren't just  ""ignorant people"" as you'd like to believe. They have legitimate  grievances some of which I named above. 

Contempt? lmao. Stop assuming things about other people. A few years back, I was like you, maybe even a bigger homophobe. Mostly because of church's teachings. I knew most if not all of their ""arguments"", which mostly are: because the ancient book says so and because gay people can't reproduce. I left the Church because I couldn't bear so much self-hatred that they indoctrinated in me by how they referred to LGBT. 

&gt; Did you know that the vast majority of pedophiles and child predators  are homosexual. I don't have the exact figure but I know it's close to  80%, so there is obviously a reason people associate pedophilia with the  LGBT. 

Source, again. I citied mine, why not you?  
And, as an asexual person I fail to see how I could be I pedophile. Remember, LGBT is not only LG.

&gt;First of all it is true that  the heigher your education the less you are likely to be religious. But  that's not because as you assume ""smarter people stay away from  religion"" but rather higher education institutions have attempted to do  away with religion as whole. They constantly criticize and attack  religion while not offering any counter arguments. 

Quote source or proof. They ""do away"" from religion because science and also school and education should be objective.  
What ""no counter arguments""? Are you talking about atheists as a whole? Go ahead, visit  r/DebateAnAtheist and ask them for their arguments, and I can assure you, you'll be flooded with them.   
I didn't say ""smarter people stay away from  religion"", my thesis was that more educated people can see a broader view than the church unlike people with no education, who don't really know anything besides Church learnings, and thus stay with it.  
You also equate uneducated people with stupid people, which is very ignorant and not always a case.

&gt;That's not how it  used to be mind you. Most of the genius scientists and inventors of the  world were Christians, a many of them also studied at universities. This  phenomenon of anti religious sentiment within higher education is a  relatively new one. 

A lot of genius scientists and inventors were also atheists. So?  
And wasn't the Church the one who tried to stop science, of course not always, but often, f.e. like they did with Copernicus? Yes, he was a catholic, but his book was banned by Church for several years.  


&gt;I think you misunderstand this figure here. As the Catholic Church  especially under Francis has been becoming more liberal, many Catholics  are unsatisfied by Francis expressing these liberal and frankly in many  cases even heretical statements. As such you will find that there are  also many conservative Christians you oppose the Catholic Church as  well. 

No, YOU misunderstood this figure here. CBOS is a POLISH opinion polling institute, doing surveys about POLES and POLAND.  
The research was not about the Church as a whole, but POLISH CATHOLIC CHURCH. I repeat, the question was about the activities of the POLISH CATHOLIC CHURCH in 2020, after many controversies in that year including but not limited to: LGBT, abortion, their pedophile affairs, their support of and influence on PiS.  
Sorry, I again assumed you knew I was talking only about the polish Church, because we talk about Poland, I directly said where my source is from and you could google them, and I don't remember Pope Francis saying LGBT people were a plague, only polish bishops. And let me tell you, the polish Catholic Church *is not* ""liberal"" in any way.

&gt;Like stating the fact that all Catholics are ignorant? That's not a fact but an opinion. 

Again, uneducated =/= stupid. You are the one who equated these terms.

&gt; Right so legally Christians shouldn't be allowed to offend or insult  homosexuals but homosexuals should freely be allowed to insult Catholics  and the Catholic Church. Don't you think you're being a little  hypocritical? 

Wow, you really don't see a difference between a defamation and a drawing? If catholics drew a cross on some pride flag, I wouldn't care. I certainly wouldn't sue them. Actually, depending on their intention, I'd even be happy or supportive.  
Who says only Christians? Anyone shouldn't. Just like I believe that not all priests are pedophiles, and anyone who says so should be able to be sued by Church as well, unless there's something like that in some religion's teachings, which then would make it true and therefore not apply, but I don't think that a religion like that exists.",,/r/europe/comments/lo623b/bigotry_in_public_policy_enforced_by_the_state/go8iovf/,Sea-Difficulty-1422,1613923353

To believe Croatia and Slovenia are sufficiently culturally different as a result of Croatia being wartorn and therefore poorer in the last century whilst Slovenia directly profited off of this is disingenuous.

5913,"Most people have already corrected you but the Poland, Lithuania, Czechia and Slovakia were re-drawn along geo-political lines and not necessarily ethnic lines. 

Some of Western Poland was historically German with some distant Polish presence at varying levels throughout modern history. After WW2 these lands were partitioned from East Germany and given to Poland. The Germans living in these cities were deported back to Germany and Poles from Central Poland were moved to settle the regions. At the same the borders of Eastern Europe were also redrawn with Central European lands being given to Eastern European states. Wroclaw and Lviv are a good examples of this. 

In Wroclaw there was a strong West Slavic/Polish presence mixed with Bohemian and German presences which all ended with a Mongol invasion somewhere mid 12th century and then it was essentially German with varying minority populations up until post-WW2 when it was handed to Poland as reparation. All the Germans living in Wroclaw were given an ultimatum; leave or go to prison. Almost every ethnic German left and the region was re-settled with ethnic Poles. On the flip side; Lviv was partitioned and incorporated into Ukraine. Lviv was historically Lendian, a West Slavic people originating from Ukraine, and ultimately was conquered by the Mongols mid-12th century. Lviv was annexed in the 13th century and became a part of Poland. Post WW2 it was incorporated into Ukraine and the region experienced a mass influx of immigration from other Soviet regions which dramatically impacted the ethnic expression of the region.

It is clear that much of the borders we see today in Western Slavic nations is more or less designated by Soviet geo-political meddling and patchwork land grabs during the post-war periods that occurred after WW1 and WW2. Historically, these regions have mixed histories and I would sit in the school of thought that argues historical claims to land are more or less arbitrary and just a part of nation-state building rather than evidence in support of the existence of a nation-state as such claims are often presented. The history I touched on is surface level and Poland is probably a bad example because I didn’t touch upon any of the Partions or the influence of Napoleonic foreign policy. Hopefully I made my point more or less and you got the gist of what I’m saying. I would agree that most Western Slavic States and ethnically homogeneous which is an oddity in of itself but I would disagree that ethnic expression is a reflection or influence on the current borders of these states. It’s just an occurrence or by product of state building during periods of turmoil such as occupations, invasions and total wars.",,/r/europe/comments/lonh58/well/go7wiqi/,Thom0,1613908559

5979,"&gt; Is something that I have written about these two operations false ? 

Yes: that a goal of operation Storm was to commit genocide. So far the only ones ever claiming this to be the case are Serbian sources, meaning subjective sources. This has also gone to court, ICJ did not rule the offensive to be genocidal. Serbians themselves screaming otherwise doesn't change this.

&gt; Serbia was not an agressor during the Yugoslav wars.

Firstly, Serbia had full control over the JNA, an army of which the majority of infantry, and close to 100% of high command, were Serbs and Montenegrins. It acted as the Serbian army, which was also directly backed by Serbian TO units. 

Obviously, this army played a big role in the Croatian war (including siege of vukovar). And in the Bosnian war it only withdrew from intervening when the UN recognized Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia. After this, intervention from Serbia was done more indirectly by encouraging Bosnian and Croatian Serbs to join VRS and RSK, and funnel weapons and money into the Serb rebel republics with continued political backing. Then of course there were also paramilitary groups that were armed and trained by the Serbian State Security Service which were then mobilized by the Serbian army to then fight in Croatia and Bosnia with impunity.

We didn't yet mention concentration camps on Serbian ground where Croatians civilians were held, raped and abused (Stajicevo), the persecution of Ceoats in Serbia by strong accelerated hate speech in the early 90's (Serbian radical party and chetniks), war crimes liks the Sjeverin massacre...


As a result of everything, the Yugoslav Tribunal concluded that Serbia was complicit both directly and indirectly of a joint-criminal enterprise regarding Croatia and Bosnia.
