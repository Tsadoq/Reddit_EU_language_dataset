3,"&gt; One of the reasons Germany's electricity is the most expensive in Europe is the huge solar-energy subsidies (levied as an energy tax) to make the sector profitable.

A huge percentage of those surcharges go to energy intensive industries and neighoring countries because of the merit order effect.

Also, those huge ""subsidies"" are mostly used for solar energy from the early 2000s. This will stop in 5-10 years. Then, the surcharge will drop fast.

&gt;Also, Germany is EXTREMELY rich in cheap Lignite (brown coal) stores

Only cheap because you don't factor in long-term costs of burning fossil fuels.

&gt;Germany is also shutting Nuclear energy stations, providing 13% of the nation's power.

Still, Germany could shut down lignite coal and nuclear at the same time, because about 10% of the electricity is exported.",,/r/europe/comments/7sbisd/catching_up_with_the_new_eu_emissions_targets/dt5l3jt/,StK84,1516772665

2002, Edmund Stoiber was chancellor candidate. In our lunch break I told a Bavarian co-worker that ""We already had a small, hectic conservative chancellor from the Southern region, it didn't do us much good.""

My colleagues were horrified, not *as such* for insinuating similarities between Hitler and Stoiber, that was more or less considered a good pun if a bit harsh.

Secondly, even if China ""bribes"" the Eastern states with good trade and investment deals, it is the fault of China offering such deals or the problem within the EU to form a coherent and equitable bloc that makes all its members act for the EU's interest instead of its own? 

Let's be honest, does the problem lies with the dysfunction within the EU itself or with China, especially in the light of Brexit, the Greek crisis and the rise of the anti EU populists in the same Eastern states?

If the EU's house in order, we wouldn't even be having this discussion about China ""bribing"" this or that.

The christianization of Bulgalria led to the ethnogenesis of the bulgarian people, destroying the lines between the slavs, thracians and bulgars. After intermixing with the local population for more than 100 years the bulgars were pretty much not a thing. Their relegion was dead, their language was dead, their culture(not that the turkic nomads had much of a culture) was dead. 

Fact is the Bulgarian Empire was slavic and christian during the 9th century. It was very much slavic even before that, give that most of its people were of slavic origin and thracian origin.

129,"&gt;Don't redistribute the UK's seats, just eliminate them.

Agree.

&gt; There is no reason to have a set number of seats anyway, such a thing is a pointless and arbitrary complication.

Limits are good.

&gt;That said this highlights a larger problem with the EU's parliamentary system: it's complicated and there is no clear link between power brokers (legislators, an elected leader, the judiciary) and policy. This is the primary thing the EU needs to fix if the EU wants to stay around, because nobody is going to trust a mass of red tape the same way they will trust ""one of their own"" elected into the EU legislature (or an EU Presidency, or an EU Judiciary).

Disagree. It's actually a very simple tweak to a parliamentary system that most European countries use. That is that cabinet members are essentially technocrats and not party lackeys.

&gt;The US's Constitutional system is an excellent framework for reform, because all of the problems being described here are similar to the ones the United States faced under the Articles of Confederation (1777-1787).

151,"&gt; It is not Ottomans has been gone years before the modernization of cities if yours ugly you have only yourself to blame and maybe Soviets and nazis.

European Urbanization primarily occurred between the years 1750-1850, during this time the Balkans was still under Ottoman rule, the industrial revolution took place during the same period of time, which the Ottomans also missed, not to mention even *when* the Ottomans left, you left us lands underdeveloped, with nothing but farm land, there was virtually no industry to speak of, not even basic road systems, The only cities that saw any development in Ottoman times anywhere near comparable with Europe was Constantinople, Smyrna, and Thessaloniki, and still it paled in comparison to the rest of Europe, the only city in the former Ottoman Empire with any actual historic areas is Istanbul today. 

&gt; It is completely different from the situation in Balkans also rest of the Turkey is quite beautiful you should visit countries you want to judge. Try Eskisehir for example that's my hometown.

It's exactly the same situation in the Balkans, also yes Turkey is beautiful, so is Greece and Bulgaria, etc, but our cities our cities are nothing special. outside Istanbul which is the exception as it was really the only place that saw anything near European development and has a unique topography which really gives the city it's charm, let us be honest if Istanbul wasn't on the Bosporus and had that unique topography and was in a position like Paris or London, just flatlands... it wouldn't be anywhere near as nice as it is. 

&gt; Lol every single country on earth was agrarian when Ottomans governed Greece please dude now you are making stuff up. industrialized and urbanized was very fast in every inch of the world so that argument is once again bogus.

Europe wasn't. As I just stated.

&gt;  reason is there was zero planning in the first place since too many migrants moved there at once and just settled without any planning.

This is exactly what I am saying. Urbanization happened very quickly so buildings were built more in mind with cost, efficiency and time rather than beauty, and things deemed unnecessary.

&gt; And you can see the same ugly buildings and planning in the entire Eastern bloc and majority of Asia that are untouched by Ottomans

Yes and those places suffered from the same inadequacies of the Ottoman Empire, abet a lesser extent, which is why their cities are the same. You are just adding to the evidence. 
you can still find very nice historic centers in Eastern Europe, but they are just smaller.

&gt; Japan and Korea are examples of how ignorant you are about this topic those countries had the fastest industrialized and urbanized we have seen in the world yet their cities did not end up like balkans.

They do have various problems with their Urban planning.

I know you love the Ottomans because it was your ""Golden Age Empire"" thing but it's a romanticized view, you can literally see the the borders of the Ottoman Empire when you look at a map of regional development, it's not a coincidence that the change happened right where the Ottomans bordered Austria, like seriously. There is a reason Transylvania is more nicer than eastern Romania, why North Serbia than south Serbia, in terms of Urban quality. You can clearly see the differences where the Ottoman Empire

161,"&gt; Trabzon is Greek land,

A strong opening! Calling a city that has been majority Turkish or at least muslim since the 18th, more likely the 17th century Greek.

&gt; Still would've still given Armenians a fair amount of land and would've made ""reconciliation"" possible.

A dubious suggestion, but we'll roll with it.

&gt; Why check Armenian statistics when Ottoman statistics from 1844 to 1867 puts Armenians as a majority before suddenly dropping to a lower, fixed number?

I know of no 1867 census being conducted. Perhaps you can enlighten us. As for the 1844 census, it is not available in its raw, first-hand recorded form. It is known to be wildly inconsistent elsewhere (like undercounting Jews) and is suggested to suffer from evasion since a major aim was to establish population available for conscription when afaik the army was still solely muslim. An additional strain is put on the relation between the censuses of the two periods by taking into account the transfer of and migration to the Kars and Batum Oblasts, making population growth as suggested in your link highly suspect. Your own example of Armenian volunteers in the Russian army supports the suggestion that this was a period of social (ethnic) upheaval.

&gt; How's it our fault that the Azeris wanted to kill all the Armenians in Artsakh?

""your relations with your neighbors are as much your doing as theirs""

As much as I enjoy messing with Azeris, the fact that Karabağ and the rest of Armenia being ethnically cleansed from Azeri Turks is not lost on most of us.

&gt; Or that Georgian politicians use Armenians as scapegoats?

I don't really understand why the scale wasn't re-centered so that at least the market liberal ends on the right side.

&gt;Why is Huhtasaari covered by that old stink-sniffing man, is he more important?

Yes. Huhtasaari is the nationalist/populist candidate, the nationalist/populist party just messily fragmented into two parts that hate each other, and she would do very well to get 5% of the vote.

Väyrynen, on the other hand is something completely incomprehensible. I genuinely have no idea why people support him, yet he's pulling ~8% now based on newest gallups.

&gt;Why does Kyllonen look like she has a gender studies degree?

That's the demographic she wants to appeal to.

&gt; Why does Niinisto look like he's a non-rehabilitated convicted murderer?

'cos he knows he's going to get away with it?

The election is a bit of a farce, because the support for the incumbent (Niinistö) is so high that it would require something ridiculous for him to lose. All the rest are basically there to get name recognition/drum up support for their party.

&gt; Who would would vote if you wanted Finland to go down in flames?

&gt;Ofcom dismisses complaints about Al Jazeera's The Lobby

...

&gt;Al Jazeera did not breach any broadcasting rules in its coverage of the pro-Israel lobby in the UK, Britain's broadcasting regulator has ruled.
...

&gt;These complaints levelled a range of charges against Al Jazeera from ""anti-Semitism"" and bias to unfair editing and infringement of privacy.

...

&gt;""The fact that the programmes uncovered evidence of inappropriate behaviour by those acting on behalf of the Israeli government, or by those belonging to a small number of organisations that promote Israeli policy, does not mean that they were anti-Semitic,"" Ofcom said. ""In the same way, programmes that expose the violence associated with some black gang culture in Britain’s inner cities are not, by default, racist.""

417,"Despite the recent rise of populist, anti-EU sentiment in Germany, Berlin seems determined to fight hard for the European Union and the common currency, the euro. Much high principle no doubt lies behind this commitment, but so also does much self interest. The German economy, most especially the German elite, has done very well for itself because of the union and the euro, not a little of it at the expense of the rest of Europe. One need not be a cynic to suspect that such less principled but nonetheless compelling motivations also direct Berlin’s commitment.

The euro was supposed to have had a universally helpful impact on all of Europe. Its designers claimed that it would give the EU stature to rival other powerful economies, the United States, Japan, and China in particular. All Europe would benefit, they said, from the trade increases that would follow as people and business shed worry over currency fluctuations, while the absence of currency risk would keep interest rates low, giving especially smaller, weaker members the advantage of cheaper credit that would encourage more investment and economic development. The trade and growth would deepen economic integration, give residents of the union a greater diversity of goods and services, and create a more unified and resilient European economy. It has of course not turned out this way. Instead the euro has locked in distorting and inequitable currency mispricings, giving some in the common currency, most notably Germany, great advantages over others.

These problems, in no small part, developed from the enthusiasm that accompanied the run up to the euro. High hopes for weaker economies, Greece, Spain, Portugal, and to a lesser extent Italy, bid up the values of their individual national currencies so that they joined the euro at values far above those supportable by their economic fundamentals. The overpricing gave these governments and their populations an inflated sense of their global economic purchasing power, encouraging spending and borrowing beyond their ability to support such behavior. Meanwhile, the inflated currency values put their producers at a competitive disadvantage. With separate currencies, reality would eventually have forced a depreciation that would have rectified both problems. But the euro, once established, locked in the mispricing.

For Germany, the opposite set of conditions prevailed. At the time, it was still suffering from the economic difficulties of its reunification. Its deutschemark was weaker than its economic fundamentals could otherwise have supported. Once that value was locked into the euro, German consumers acquired a deflated sense of their global buying power and so proceeded more cautiously than others in Europe. German producers meanwhile discovered that the euro had effectively locked in pricing for their goods and services well below levels with which they otherwise could have coped. International Monetary Fund (IMF) data suggests that at the euro’s inception, this currency distortion gave German industry a 6% competitive advantage compared with the country’s economic fundamentals.

Right from the start, then, the currency union divided the Eurozone into two classes of economies: producers and consumers. Greece, Spain Portugal, Italy, and other weaker economies over consumed and under produced. The Germans did the opposite. The difference surely contributed to the fiscal-financial crises that have plagued Europe’s periphery since. Meanwhile, the biases locked into the euro at the onset have since built on themselves. The Germans, with every inducement to produce, have poured effort into expansion and efficiency, improving their economic fundamentals and widening the gap between economic reality and the euro’s expression of it. The rest of Europe, most especially its periphery, has enjoyed no such positive inducements. They, understandably, have neglected productive effort, while the austerities imposed by the fiscal-financial crisis made them still less inclined to invest in the future. Their fundamentals consequently have fallen further behind. Updated IMF data suggests that by 2017 the German pricing edge built into the euro had about doubled to over 12%.

With the fiscal-financial crisis, itself partly a product of the currency mispricing, German export advantages spilled outside Europe. Because the crises drove down the euro’s value against the dollar, the yen, and other currencies, German industry’s pricing advantage extended to the global marketplace, certainly compared to where matters would have stood if Germany had an independent currency that avoided the taint of Europe’s troubled economies. To some extent, the euro’s depreciation should have helped exporters throughout Europe, but the original German advantages ensured that most of the benefit went to that country’s producers. The euro’s decline of some 30 percent against the dollar and the yen during these last ten years has placed Japanese and American producers at an increasingly adverse position opposite their German competition. German industry makes no complaints. On the contrary, it rejoices over a huge trade surplus that has risen to over 8% of the county’s entire gross domestic product (GDP).

Berlin and the German media have pushed away any talk of particular advantages. They certainly deny that the country engineered matters in this way. This may be so. No one at the euro’s birth anticipated such a result, not even the Germans. But whether the advantage was planned or not, Berlin, it is clear, has certainly gained. To perpetuate this favorable arrangement it has poured resources into support of the union and the euro. Germany has, for instance, put some 671 billion euros ($752 billion) at risk, one quarter of its gross domestic product (GDP), to hold things together by supporting Greece and other troubled nations on Europe’s periphery. It has also helped lasso the IMF into such lending. Berlin claims that all this money reflects only its commitment to the European experiment in union. That is an awful lot of altruism. A more cynical observer might suggest such extreme actions have an alternative motivation, a desperate effort to prevent the unraveling of arrangements that continue to serve German industry so well.

Though it would seem to redound to the advantage of everyone (except German industrialists) to unwind this system, it is not apparent that Europe even wants a change. Its leaders talk mostly of a harmonization of tax and spending policies. That might reduce some of the hardship imposed by the pricing biases built into the euro but not remove the basic problem. Otherwise no one, neither Berlin nor Paris nor Brussels, seems even willing to admit that such distortions exist, much less that an adjustment would provide relief. For the foreseeable future, then, the world generally and Europe in particular seem destined to suffer from these distortions as well as from the periodic financial panics that have grown out of them.

The police stopped them for no particular reason other than it was 5 teenagers (of Moroccan and Yugoslavian descent) in a ~20k car, took the car and all their cash money. They didn't have their money on bank accounts, so the police thought all the money was ""black money"". So they were left at around 2:00 in the night in the middle of nowhere between the cities, without money. They were forced to walk home 25km, which took them 6 hours, so they arrived home the next morning at 8:00.

They like the idea of being seen that way. They don't like the thing itself when it comes at their own expense.

It's something you see across the West. Every year, more people say in polls that they have fewer objections to the idea of interracial relationships, that they oppose the concept of racism more, et cetera. But you also see that there is heavier geographical segregation every year and that people have fewer friends of other races than before.

&gt;The Cabinet does not pass judgement on Turkey's invasion of a North Syrian region owned by a Kurdish militia.

&gt;The fact that there is as yet no evidence that the so-called Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) have attacked Turkey from North Syrian Africa must, according to the SP, be a reason for condemning Turkey's actions. But Zijlstra points out, however, that there have indeed been attacks on Turkish soil, and Ankara claims that some of these have been carried out from Afrin.

&gt;Moreover, the YPG seems to be closely linked to the PKK, which the European Union has identified as a terrorist movement, and according to Zijlstra, it does not consist in any way of' innocent lambs'.

Men and women are _not_ de facto equal. Men and women are different, individually and as groups as well. Not to mention that not even two men or two women are de facto equal.

&gt;Recognizing that violence against women is a manifestation of historically unequal power relations between women and men, which have led to domination over, and discrimination against, women by men and to the prevention of the full advancement of women;

Bullshit, and leads to dangerous consequences. Basically places the patriarchy theory, the basis of all feminist doctrine into law.

Like this:
&gt;Recognizing the structural nature of violence against women as gender?based violence, and that violence against women is one of the crucial social mechanisms by which women are forced into a subordinate position compared with men;

&gt;Recognising the ongoing human rights violations during armed conflicts that affect the civilian population, especially women in the form of widespread or systematic rape and sexual violence[…]

As Hillary said, ""women have always been the primary victims of war"". Yeah, because 80% of civilian casualties being men is not enough.

It was later found out that he had made anti-Shia and anti-Kurd Facebook posts and photos surfaced of him posing with a known Islamist organization. He was also suspected of pocketing fundraiser money. Police started investigating him and he was later convicted of two assaults, attempted blackmailing, tax fraud, accounting violations as well as smuggling doping and drugs to Finland.

Catalonia was already industrialized before Franco, like the Basque Country and Madrid.

So, in a sense, the majority of businesses and workers were rather fucked by Franco's industrial planning.  The fact that a car factory was decided to be put in Barcelona is not the reason ""why it became so industrialized"". First of, because a car factory doesn't turn the tide that much. You can't have a non-inudstrialized region become ""so industrialized"" because of a car factory. Second of, the reasoning behind the decision has a direct relation with the fact that the region was already industrialized and met the requirements to make the best of the factory, as well as geographical advantage, of course.

Breton has fallen from a million speakers at the start of the 20th century to a tenth of that. This is how you kill a language in a century. Congratulations France!

&gt; France is slowly turning from trying to exterminate everey other language to actually caring about them.

How does France care for its languages?

In Corsica, the nationalists want Corsican to be a co official language in Corsica, the HOME of the Corsican language.

 If France cared about the Corsican language, it would agree, and yet the French government came out immediately saying that 'only French is the official language of the Republic'. These monoglots, these people who only know one language have swallowed the monolingual kool aid and show no sign of budging from their ignorant stance. A minoritised language will never stop being minoritised unless it comes out from under the shadow of the language that is minoritising it (by definition).

What does France actually DO to care for Basque, for Breton, for Alsacien, for Picard, for Auvergnat, for Moselle Franconian, for Gallo, for Catalan, for Flemish, for Tahitian, for Wayana, for the Kanak languages, and I could go on and on? Do you even know?

Do you know what the linguistic situation is for all of these languages?

I've read the linguistic literature, but you don't need to be a linguist to know that. Go to Vimeu and talk to the people. See how many young people speak Picard. See how many old people speak Picard (not many). Go to Tahiti and ask the young people if they speak Tahitian. Not many. Most are monolingual French speakers. You just need to talk to the people to know that the languages of France are being annihilated by French.

Palestine is occupied and cared for with the most amount of gift money anybody in the world becomes. Electricity is provided by Israel. Today there are like 5 million more Palestinians inside Palestine than in 1948. Is the situation perfect? Obviously not. But comparing this to the Holocaust is either denying the Holocaust happened or it is trivializing it. How many Jews were in Europe living in 1932 and how many Jews live here today?

Can you tell me? Can you tell me how this is comparable to the situation Palestinians are facing in palestine? No you obviously can't without resorting to denying the Holocaust happened.

The UK is a unitary state, but it still has legislators responsible for representing the people in individual chunks of the country: these political units are much smaller than the NI/Scotland/Wales/England units, anyway.

Anyway, I checked and it looks like the Dutch system does not provide geographic representation.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district

&gt;An electoral district, (election) precinct, election district, or legislative district, called a voting district by the US Census[1] (also known as a constituency, riding, ward, division, electoral area, or electorate) is a territorial subdivision for electing members to a legislative body. Generally, only voters (constituents) who reside within the district are permitted to vote in an election held there. From a single district, a single member or multiple members might be chosen.

-

&gt;Not all democratic political systems use separate districts or other electoral subdivisions to conduct elections. Israel, for instance, conducts parliamentary elections as a single district, while the 26 electoral districts in Italy and the 20 in the Netherlands have a role in the actual election, but no role whatsoever in the division of the seats. Ukraine elected half of the Verkhovna Rada (the Ukrainian Parliament) in this way in the elections in October 2012.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/7scus4/whats_your_opinion_on_the_plan_for_paneuropean/dt4292u/,vokegaf,1516715036

828,"&gt;Can you please elaborate on this ""acting aggressively"" already? 

Just a quick detour from the main point, there are so many way you can act aggressively. Like how you walk towards somebody, the body language in general. And the important part here is not if somebody really was aggressive, but if the other side perceived as aggressive. (This is not a black and white issue)

In that case let me take out the sledgehammer: The primary source.

http://www.haz.de/Hannover/Aus-der-Stadt/Uebersicht/Flughafen-Langenhagen-Massenschlaegerei-zwischen-Tuerken-und-Kurden

&gt;Ersten Informationen zufolge hatten Kurden am Flughafen spontan gegen das militärische Vorgehen der Türkei gegen Kurden in Syrien demonstriert. Aus der Menge heraus waren unter anderem „Faschist Erdogan“-Rufe zu hören. Türkische Fluggäste von Turkish Airlines sollen die Demonstranten angegangen haben. Die Polizei musste Pfefferspray einsetzen, um beide Seiten voneinander zu trennen. Danach hatte die  Polizei hat die Lage unter Kontrolle.

Quick translation via google (with my correction if required):

&gt;According to initial information, Kurds at the airport had spontaneously demonstrated against Turkey's military action against Kurds in Syria. Out of the crowd, among other things, ""Faschist Erdogan"" calls were heard. Turkish passengers of Turkish Airlines are said to have attacked the demonstrators. The police had to use pepper spray to separate both sides. After that, the police had the situation under control.

Do you notice how that article has the exactly opposite point of view?

And yes in the video you can see how 3 people of Kurdish side move to towards the passengers and also how 3 Turkish passengers go towards those protesters.

Also i rewatched the important part of the video a few times just now and i can say with certainty:

The woman moves back and swings the flag/pole between herself and that passenger. **At a distance that makes it impossible to hit him.**

984,"Edit: LOOONG, but please read. I give context about why the opposition is now in such pitiful state and in the latter part why PiS is really well liked. Some of you seem to think that PiS supporters are nationalists. Well yes, those would go for PiS out of the main parties, but they are a very unsignificant part of PiS’s 40 percent voters. Most are respectable and quite tolerant people. Why do they to for PiS, read on, as the faults of the former ruling parties is something not well known in the west, though some of their actions would have caused a great scandal, like if the Warsaw criminal re-privatization happened in London or Paris

Context: PiS chose Morawiecki as new prime minister. He is much more centrist. He removed the most controversial ministers like Macierewicz. So more people can now stand behind the government. 

At the same time two abortion projects went to the parliament. Both of the sort proposed by some NGO with signatures collected in order for them to be elligable for further proceedings. One almost completely stops abortion, one liberalizes it by far. PiS promised to NEVER eliminate such public projects before they can go into processing committee. And they came through. The whole PiS elite, even far right Macierewicz coted to keep both projects. The “liberal” opposition however screwed it’s voters. Nowoczesna and PO had some people not present (who often gave lame excuses) and some voting against the liberal project. And it failed, won’t even go to committees to be further processed. Thanks to “liberal” opposition. This made many linerals very mad. I think never in the history of democratic Poland has any party screwed it’s own voters on something that matters for them. So now a lot of liberal, left and feminist voters have had enough. Women’s black marches now target the traitors more than PiS. Left wing parties like Razem and the post Communist SLD got a boost. It’s just natural that people are mad about such an opposition which does not care about it’s voters. This will take a long time to change.

Basically at this point, a new lineral opposition with new names is needed and would be welcome. The old one has no chance. They pissed off a lot of people Even those with similiar views.

Also, you see an European perspective. I like the European perspective, but it looks different to the average Joe in Poland. The rule of law thingy. The average Pole doesn’t see what the EU fuss was about. He sees that the old courts were a laughing stock. Polish criminal cases take years, some can take decades and actually never end if someone high up wants it to be like that. Civil cases? Forget it. Even worse. Companies have gone bankrupt waiting for many years for courts to help them in cases which would take two weeks in the west. Average Joes usually don’t even get any justice in civic courts, and give up due to costs. Polish judiciary is actually the worst (as in slowest, least efficient, not as in corrupt - this problem is not prominent now^). And in a speeding world this makes people furious. So almost anyone who had any dealings with judiciary is for the PiS reform, thinking it can’t get worse (though it probably can)
^- supposedly, but police catching dangerous criminals, courts letting them out on bail and said criminals dissappearing is a common theme. For an example google the case of “Hoss”, a notorious criminal who made a scamming system which hit mainly the senior population. It was a big scandal not long ago. The police caught him, the court let him out despite him being the elusive masterminde type, the re-police caught him in the end after many months, but it wasn’t easy.

Add to this the criminal reprivatization in Warsaw - PO city government giving back buildings (with tennants), which were taken over in the 50s by communist authorities to crooked lawyers who had powers of attorny signed by pre war owners, when they were, for instance... 130 years old. And no Warsaw bureaucrat and no court found this wrong, despite the age and proof in documents that the man was long dead. Of course the long dead owners had no family etc, so the mafia like structure basically just stole million dollar buildings for themselevs. PiS came, put up a special commission and now the buildings are being returned to the city and rightful owners... and finally some criminals landed in jail

Or the fact that before PiS, people who worked in the communist special police and secret services, when retired had 5000+ retirement payments, with generals and other high up people, even those responsible for communist attacks on civilians, getting even 10-15 thousand. With the aberage Pole getting 1000-2000 thousand. Now PiS came and change the retirement payments of communist officials to the legal minimum. Populist, maybe, but very welcomed by 98 percent of society.

Ok, hope to give you some context. I mean I’m not a fan of PiS and I’m very much pro European, but too much people think (no doubt thanks to the media) that Poles or at least PiS supporters are mad nationalists. Most of them are not, are quite tolerant normal people (see the tolerance maps, Poland does not land that bad).

TLDR: A suspicious high number of people donated exactly the same amount (around 340e), maximum what is allowed for an individual, and even the president of the country (party), said he ""thinks"" it is because people who wanted to donate more couldn't (against the law), so they found ""friends"" and gave them money to donate.

1083,"Exactly. Everyone in Iceland knows what really happened:

&gt; In the beginning, there were two regions: Muspelheim in the south, full of fire, light and heat; and Niflheim in the north, full of arctic waters, mists, and cold. Between them stretched the yawning emptiness of Ginnungagap, and into it poured sparks and smoke from the south and layers of rime and glacial rivers from the north. As heat and cold met in Ginnungagap, a living jǫtunn, Ymir, appeared in the melting ice. From his left armpit, the first man and woman were born. From his legs, the frost jötnar were born, making Ymir the progenitor of the jǫtnar. Most sources identify Ymir's oldest son as Þrúðgelmir, who bore Ymir's grandson, Bergelmir. The other jǫtnar are usually unnamed. Ymir fed on the milk of the cow Auðumbla. She licked the blocks of salty ice, releasing Búri.

&gt; Búri's son Borr had three sons, the gods Odin, Vili and Vé. The three slew Ymir, and all of the jötnar (giants) except for Bergelmir and his wife, were drowned in the blood of the others. From Ymir's body, they made the world of humans: his blood the seas and lakes, his flesh the earth, his bones the mountains and his teeth the rocks. From his skull they made the dome of the sky, setting a dwarf at each of the four corners to hold it high above the earth. They protected it from the jötnar with a wall made from Ymir's eyebrows. Next they caused time to exist, and placed the orbs of the sun and moon in chariots which were to circle around the sky.

&gt;Odin, passing through the world of the jötnar, found two beautiful young giants named Sól and Máni, sun and moon. They were brother and sister, and their father had named them after the beautiful lights in the sky. Odin decreed that Sól and Mani should drive the chariots of the sun and the moon across the sky, and to ensure that their journey was always constant and never slowed, he created two great wolves. These wolves were called Hati and Sköll, and they were placed in the sky to pursue the chariots and devour them if they caught them.

&gt; Conclusion: *Passengers inside an EV could be exposed to MFs of considerable strength when compared with conventional vehicles or to other daily exposures* 

http://www.earthcalm.com/hybrid-car-radiation

&gt; *Unfortunately, there’s now evidence that hybrids emit a startlingly high amount of electromagnetic radiation that’s hazardous to your health.*

http://www.avaate.org/spip.php?article2516

&gt; *Hybrid and electric cars may be cancer-causing as they emit extremely low frequency (ELF) electromagnetic radiation (EMR) or magnetic fields. Recent studies of the levels of EMR emitted by these automobiles have claimed either that they pose a cancer risk for the vehicles’ occupants or they are safe.*

**https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/radiation-exposure/extremely-low-frequency-radiation.html**

&gt; *Examples of high-energy radiation include x-rays and gamma rays. They, as well as some higher energy ultraviolet (UV) rays, are classified as ionizing radiation, which means that they have enough energy to remove an electron from (ionize) an atom. Ionizing radiation can damage the DNA inside cells, which can lead to mutations and the uncontrolled cell growth we know as cancer*.

There's also evidence to suggest that electric car are especially dangerous because the occupant happens to be in a metallic enclosure with the source of radiation, which reflects off metallic surfaces resonating internally and dramatically amplifying the exposure.",Romanian,/r/europe/comments/7s90jb/the_future_is_here_first_electric_car_in_my/dt3vkq7/,Gaudeamuss,1516701614

1097,"After the tight SPD vote on coalition negotiations with the Union, the Social Democratic Party continues to bleed support according to a survey of the population. 

According to the Forsa survey published on Monday by RTL and n-tv, the party slipped by one point to 17 percent compared to the previous week. AfD and Die Linke improved by one point to 13 and 11 percent, respectively. The other parties remained unchanged compared to the Forsa survey shortly before the party congress: CDU / CSU 34, FDP 8, Greens 12 percent.

The SPD decision to enter coalition talks has a different echo in the population. According to a poll by Spiegel Online, in collaboration with Civey pollsters, citizens were skeptical about the Social Democrats' decision. By contrast, according to the Forsa survey, a majority of Germans welcomed the SPD vote.

According to Civey survey a good 51 percent judged the decision of the SPD party congress as ""rather negative"" or even ""very negative"". Only about 40 percent of the 5,100 respondents who cast their votes online came to a ""rather positive"" or ""very positive"" vote.

According to Forsa, 59 percent of respondents were pleased to note the SPD resolution. 37 percent did not think the decision was correct, 4 percent were undecided.

The middle ages were heavily ritualized and dependent on their class system, which wasnt just any arbitary system to them, but gods own will. And that was even more true for something like an religious order. People that werent part of the nobility could join, but only as layman, serving as man at arms in a conflict.

So i highly doubt that this man was elevated by merit of his size. Either he was the son of a knight, and got a higher lord to pay for his armor (a lot of knights couldnt pay for armor for all of their sons. Far too expensive, even before the age of plate), or he was a man at arms who indeed destinguished himself in battle enough to make it seem that investing in armor for him was worth it. You shouldnt forget that this armor was incredibly expensive. You dont throw that around to any random guy just because hes big.

That way deportation could be enforced, and we could have quite a lot of guest worker, students etc. It also gives a lot of good incentives for countries to upfill certain minimum standard to get access to Europe.

1241,"Hello my curious Indian friend. Can I see bobs? Sorry, just kidding.

I will sacrifice my life and give you a serious explanation. 

South-Slav ultra-nationalism only persists at sports games or regionally.

 Everywhere else we are 'naši' speaking 'naš' language. 'Our people speaking our language.' Macedonians and Slovenians are honorary naši. We can understand one another (languages are 60% same) and the mentality is very similar. Most Macedonians and many Slovenians speak Serbo-Croatian anyway. 

Less commonly, Albanians can sometimes sneak into the group and become naši, but only far abroad, far away from the balkans. This is because most Albanians speak fluent Serbo-Croatian. Some will pretend they don't-especially in Albanian itself-but don't be fooled, they do. 

Any cultural difference comes from the respective religions. Bosniak Muslims, Croatian Catholics and Serbian Orthodox Christians. And it is minor, because religion is something you practice in your own or in your family time.

And even with Muslims, Bosniak muslims are very non-conformist. They drink alcohol to fit in, many eat bacon, gender segregation is non-existent; there are night-clubs in Sarajevo etc. So it doesn't get in the way of friendly gatherings, especially chance meetings abroad. 

Sure, there is always a small minority of assholes ready to prance. But such is life.

I can tell you from personal experience that before 1989 (at least in my country) the state banned abortions and there were no condoms. Many women aborted illegally. There was very little food and conditions were harsh.

Then, in 1989, abortions were legalised, condoms available, and people just wanted a better life, so they stopped making babies. Because we were forced to make many babies in the past by the criminal will of the state, people just reject parenting now to a larger degree than normal.

Also, a generation ago families were much larger, at least in the countryside. On my wife's side her parents both had 7 brothers and sisters, on my side both parents had 5. The reduction from 5 to 2 happened in one generation. I have one brother and my wife is an only child. Today you rarely see more than 2 and many have just one or no child.",Romania,/r/europe/comments/7s7o2u/eastern_europe_is_shrinking_before_our_eyes_the/dt3pblv/,visarga,1516687779

1352,"By inevitable civil war I mean Putin's death. He has no replacement, Medvedev is not an option because of his bad reputation and enormous amounts of stupid shit he said on TV. UR won't step away from power without the fight, so that's where the civil war comes in. I believe it would be quick though. Depends on how much army support they get.

I agree that Russia will invade, but i do not agree with that solution. You see, Putin is evidently not a master of long term politics(nor does he need to be, the dude does not care about anything that comes after him). He basically drove us in a situation where the only possible alternative to hostile EU is preemptive strike/defensive war. Our relations with EU will be almost impossible to repair, when we could trade with positive consequences for us both. Instead of invading, we should maintain friendly relations. We get to modernize, you get raw resources for cheap. We need your high tech equipment for farming, mining, manufacturing. We need to modernize our military industry(this brings us a lot of profit, and would bring us even more if were to modernize it). If we manage to stop EU's sanctions and expand trade with their companies, we will have an economic boom. If France wants the most independence, we could even join EU defence pact(whatever you would call it) to defend against the US. China threatens us a lot too, so we would need allies in the near future. EU is the most fitting candidate.


The eastern europans would be afraid in any circumstance though. They blame us for Soviet + Imperial actions, however I do not understand why I am being blamed for occupying Poland 70 years ago. They hate us on historical level and would hate us even if we were allies. As I seen on reddit, a lot of them hate Russians directly as an nationality, and goverment in EU typically represents the views of the people. I cannot judge entire population of Estonia(for example), but it's very likely that a lot of Estonians share this view of us. We are not interested in Baltics for now as well, only Eastern Estonia is of interest to Putin. He wants his minorities so badly, and this brings him a lot of population support. If an attack happens, it will be because of all EU, not of EE primarily

-- What does your country want long term wise:


I do not have a slightest idea what does Putin want, because he does not seem to want to attack Ukraine and other states of Central Asia to bring them into direct control. The most probable reason is leaving his cronies in power, seizing territory gives him a lot of population support(can be seen on the statistics from Levada Centre). He does not care about the long term most likely, he does everything for himself. I didn't even know anything about Abkhaizia until he invaded it for fuck sake! A lot of people don't know about it as well, but they feel 'proud' about it and support Putin because of 'liberating' from Georgian dictatorships. 


Russia becoming an normal country needs United Russia to step away from power peacefully, or an revolution will happen. Who knows what will happen after that? We might become Best Korea number two because of that. We need social democrats/democratic socialists in power to repair our trade unions(people are literally working like slaves on factories, we also need political activism). We also need fair elections with establishment parties banned from participating. There are no discussion about it on the main TV, but there is some on opposition media. For now opposition is too weak to do anything, we can only wait.

Democracy is literally ""rule of the people"". If the people aren't voting, then they do not rule, ergo it is an undemocratic system in favour of the people who are voting.

It encourages people who actually want change to vote, and if people want the status quo, they don't vote. What specifically is undemocratic about that?

&gt;Yes, that would probably be the smart thing to do, better to be alive than politically correct.

Do you want me to list the things that kill more people than terrorism? (based on UK statistics)

Cars, Suicide, alcohol, smoking, farm animals, bathtubs, ladders, inhaling food, swimming pools, suicide, general assault, exposure to cold, exposure to heat, poison.

The former communist state once again becomes a battlefield for the soul of Europe, because populists are trying to dismantle the liberal order after the Cold War,""The Wall Street Journal""writes about Poland.

The starting point for extensive material on the situation in Poland in the American ""The Wall Street Journal"" is the current authorities' approach to Lech Wa??sa. As we read in the article,""the most famous Polish dissident of the twentieth century"", an employee of the shipyard, leader of the Solidarity movement and Nobel Peace Prize laureate, is thrown out of official memory by a popular political party which, like others in Europe, reconstructs this democracy, which it helped to build itself.

The newspaper writes that the revolution led by Wa??sa opened the way to the unification of Europe that ""the victory seemed so striking that optimists spoke of the end of history"". However, as he notes,""the struggle for the soul of Europe is taking place again in Poland"". Why? PiS ""protests the history of"" recent decades to ""build a new kind of democracy that serves a populist, nationalistic vision"". Moreover, as the WSJ points out, a similar situation can also be observed in other European countries, while those who want to overturn the order claim that ""control over people's lives has been given to elites, technocrats and courts"", leaving voters limited influence on reality. And it is they who ""promise to restore power to ordinary people"".

As ""WSJ"" writes, PiSa accuses Wa??sa of putting the nation on the road to a technocratic republic, which she herself considers corrupt, elite and insufficiently Polish. Moreover, the transformation of Wa??sa ""from a hero to a traitor is accompanied by attacks on independent institutions - from courts to the media"".

WSJ ""points out that although Jaros?aw Kaczy?ski is an ordinary deputy, he is considered to be the main playmaker, and while following the history of the Kaczy?ski brothers' relationship with Wa??sa, he even reminds them of their children's film episode. The newspaper reminds us that they not only worked together in Solidarity, but also that they cooperated during and after the breakthrough. And that it was only later that their paths spread.

WSJ ""writes about the beginnings of PiSi, a party which set itself the goal of breaking with what it"" perceived as imposing liberal European values "", about the return of the Catholic Church to the centre of Polish life. Writing about the Smolensk catastrophe,""WSJ"" notes that despite the official reasons for the Smolensk catastrophe, Kaczy?ski ""had his own theory: his brother was murdered"", in which Russia was involved and what hid the Polish Liberals. He continues to believe this "", notes the newspaper, quoting even his words about"" canals ""shouted at the Sejm against the opposition.

Analyzing Kaczy?ski's path to power,""WSJ"" notes that by 2015 ""many Poles started to perceive the EU as: economically important, but culturally dangerous"".

WSJ ""notes that once PiS has taken power again, it"" will no longer allow courts to stand in its way "". In this context, he mentions further steps of the Law and Justice party, from the TK to the Supreme Court. The reconstruction of the country by PiS "", writes the newspaper, also included museums"" in order to make room for a new story about Polish history "". In order to legitimise the party's visions, it seems to be willing to destroy Wa??sa's reputation and deprive him of his role as the father of democracy.",,/r/europe/comments/7sb3ec/the_wall_street_journal_polish_authorities_erase/dt3duh8/,sektabox,1516673542

1463,"Hamza bin Walayat argued that if Islam was abandoned, it would endanger his country with a fatal danger. However, officials considered that his views were ""inconsistent and unreliable"". 

The case has aroused members of Humanists in the UK, who accuse Home Office (i. e. the UK Ministry of the Interior) of' deep and dangerous lack of understanding'.
He was to receive fatal threats from Pakistan

Hamza bin Walayat abandoned Islam and called himself a humanist. He has been living on the Islands since 2011, he joined a non-Muslim partner. When his student visa ended, the authorities wanted to expel him. He applied for asylum at that time on the grounds that he was threatened with persecution in his homeland.

He claims that because of his secular life in the United Kingdom, he has been subjected to fatal threats from his family in Pakistan and the local Pakistani community in the Islands. The figures are being persecuted in Pakistan and face severe punishments, including the death penalty for blasphemy.

However, Home Office rejected the request, considering that Walayat's views were' not consistent or credible'. Evidence? Although during the conversation he presented a ""basic definition"" of humanism, he could not name a single Greek humanist philosopher. According to the document quoted by' Sky News', he also stated that humanism developed in the 17th century, could not identify the international symbol of humanists and until August was not a member of any of their organisations.

Your knowledge of humanism is at best fundamental and not at the level expected of a true humanist "", said the officials.
What is humanism?

    According to the Humanists UK group quoted by Guardian, humanism is not, however,""a canonical system of faith in which believers have to learn and follow strict behavioural practices. A humanist can be simply someone who rejects a religious faith but has a positive vision of human values.

The representatives of the group believe that the ministry has shown a ""deep and dangerous lack of understanding"" and the discussion with Walayat was simply unfair.

However, one might also suggest that it's because men are unwilling to take a larger part in child-rearing or unwilling to make a hard commitment (*looks speculatively at the marriage rate in Europe*) or because society is unwilling to internalize thr externalities in child-rearing or because we're uncomfortable in eliminating the family as the basic social unit and making the state rear children or any number of other changes.  Maybe if we used modern technology to choose the gender of children to be 100:1 female, where single mothers would be the norm and only a TFR of 1.06 would be required to be self-sustaining.

I mean, I can imagine a lot of societies that could be self-sustaining.  Yes, our society today is not.  But that doesn't mean that rolling back to the 1920s is the *only* sort of social change that might address it.  And I'm profoundly suspicious that if asked, most women don't want that change as a way of addressing the issue.

Politically, whatever sort of change you want is probably going to require buy-in from a majority of society to be viable.  So not having female support is going to be a pretty substantial obstacle.

1587,"&gt; Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and the Greek government in general had been very uncomfortable since a major rally against the use of the word ‘Macedonia’ in the name of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia was announced.

&gt; The national broadcaster ERT blatantly ignored the demonstration, obediently following the Maximos Mansion line

&gt; Protesters speak of 500,000, which might be exaggerated but it closer to the true number than 90,000. Nevertheless, the hundreds of thousands who arrived in Thessaloniki from all parts of Greece to demonstrate cannot be overlooked.

&gt; Government-friendly media labeled protesters as “extreme rightists”, “nationalists”, “fascists”, “Christian fundamentalists” and so on. The fact that Golden Dawn participated in the rally was used to label every single participant as one of the above descriptions.

&gt; The main organizer of the rally, retired army general Fragkoulis Fragkos, was accused of trying to form a new nationalist party by the government-friendly Efimerida ton Syntakton newspaper, following the SYRIZA line that whoever is not a party voter is a deplorable neoliberal fascist, or a person worth ridiculing at best.

&gt; They also attacked the main opposition New Democracy, accusing leader Kyriakos Mitsotakis of trying to “fish voters from the Golden Dawn pool”. 

&gt; The main reason the government feared Sunday’s rally was that it was also a demonstration of the distress Greeks feel for the ruthless taxation and continuous degradation of their lives by the Tsipras administration.

&gt; Overall it was a defeat, for Tsipras and the Archbishop who indirectly tried to sabotage the protest rally. Now at Maximos Mansion they have to worry about the new demonstration scheduled in Athens for Feb. 4.

- All blue countries have high levels of automation. I visited the Inbev main brewery in  Leuven once, and we barely met a worker... It's nearly completely automated.

Since the items in your list don't really explain why population growth is higher in the blue countries, I think the main dynamic is the relative wealth difference between EU member states, creating the move from the relatively less wealthy to the relatively wealthier areas.

1678,"Morocco is not at war and many North Africans in Europe end up as drug dealers, criminals and terrorists. They are not refugees. Where is the war in North Africa?

King Hassan II and the Makhzen deliberately tried to drive Riffian Berbers to Europe and kept the Rif (and most of Morocco) in deep poverty and suppress their identity in Morocco. He wanted to avoid any base of discontent building up against his rule and export the opposition against his rule to Europe so they would bother Europeans instead. Hassan II legalized marijuana growing in part of the Rif so he hoped Riffian Berbers would become drug dealers and flood western Europe with marijuana and hashish. 

Lots of non-Riffian Moroccans, Algerians and Tunisians in Western Europe become terrorists, gangsters, and drug dealers too. So its not just that.

North Africa also doesn't have any native Christians after the Middle Ages unlike the Middle East. So the Islamists among them see Catholics and Christians and non-Muslims in general as the ""enemy"".

When you import tons of people with this kind of mentality and culture this is what happens. Its not stereotyping because there are mobs of criminals and gangs from this background attacking and robbing people in France. Belgium and most terrorists and foreign fighters in continental Western Europe are of North African origin. If you are from any other ethnicity its not safe to walk around the ghettos they live in.

Paris attacks, Nice Attack, Berlin attack, Barcelona attack, and the mass sexual attacks at Cologne were all done by North Africans. And most of Belgium and Netherland's terrorists in Syria and France as well come from this background.

Korean singer Park Joon-hyung was attacked by a mob of North Africans in Belgium when he visited. Western Europe is developing a reputation for danger to tourists from those countries.

1705,"I don't believe that the American flag was quite as omnipresent, though until the 20th century.  The Constitution was.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pledge_of_Allegiance_(United_States)

&gt;In his recollection of the creation of the Pledge Francis Bellamy said, ""At the beginning of the nineties patriotism and national feeling was (sic) at a low ebb. The patriotic ardor of the Civil War was an old story ... The time was ripe for a reawakening of simple Americanism and the leaders in the new movement rightly felt that patriotic education should begin in the public schools.""[15] James Upham ""felt that a flag should be on every schoolhouse,""[15] so his publication ""fostered a plan of selling flags to schools through the children themselves at cost, which was so successful that 25,000 schools acquired flags in the first year (1892-93).[15]

I suppose that the root of that being via a man with a successful sales plan is probably par for the course.

I don't know what the political role of the Union Jack was, but my understanding is that in Europe, after the World Wars, there was an effort to de-emphasize nationalism, and I suppose that national symbols would have been part of that.  Makes it easier to avoid wars if a radical leader can't rally the public easily to fight and die against a neighbor.  Plus, nationalism at the state level would have interfered with the European Project, once that was underway.

And, of course, the flags of the constituent members of the UK would have encouraged division between them.

Also, in the UK, you've got the King or Queen, a separate head of state, to express affection for.  Their job has shifted from their original role as warlord into hereditary administrator and from there to promoting unity.  We don't have that — we've got the President, and about half the population is going to normally have opposed his election and isn't too friendly to him.  Plus, setting policy is going to make some people unhappy.  I suspect that that's part of why the Constitution, flag, and bald eagle play a bigger symbolic role here — they are the symbols of the continuing country as an entity, and outlive policy and administration.  That's a common thing that everyone can agree to support.

I remember making some fairly cynical remarks about the politicking of the President in Portugal — the head of state — and some Portuguese really did not like that.  That wouldn't happen with a US President, I think.

Semi-divine?  Well…I don't think many people talk about the [Commerce Clause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce_Clause).  The [Bill of Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Bill_of_Rights), maybe.  If government is not permitted to violate the Constitution by the public, that the rest of the system can also be intact and repaired if need be.  It's universal across the US, whereas many other things vary by state.  Even federal law is limited in scope by the Constitution to the areas that federal law covers, but the Constitution touches everything.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/7s54jh/macron_france_would_have_left_eu_in_similar/dt2qmjk/,vokegaf,1516650236

1711,"&gt;Europe is already diverse: we have French, Germans, Polish, Serbs, Italians, etc.

If you're only willing to accept ""diversity"" between people who basically look like you and have extremely similar cultures, that's not saying much. And compared to Europe, pretty much every continent has far more diversity in cultures, ideas, religions, etc. We need to do more to accept and welcome them here.

&gt;Racism is defined by the attribution of essential and inalienable moral characters to a race. Therefore, integration is the contrary of racism as it implies someone from a different ethnic background can be part of another culture. ""Culture is above Nature""

That's as the case may be, but expecting everyone to integrate into your culture is still discriminatory and exclusionary. It's not what multiculturalism is about. Instead of inviting and promoting diversity, you're trying to get rid of it or confine it to a set of cliche approved expressions that also coincide with our pre-conceived values.

&gt;There's indeed a European (or Western) civilisation, as there's an Islamic or a Confucian civilisation, and I can define it easily if you want

If you can do this without invoking racism, nationalism, religious bias, or chauinism of any kind, go right ahead. But my point is, ""European"" is purely a geographic descriptor. Europeans are people who currently exist in Europe. And you couldn't possibly argue that all of us have some kind of common culture. You're probably using the racist definition of the past, racially homogeneous Europe. That Europe is gone, and you need to stop appealing to it. The new Europe is open to all races and cultures, therefore it's absurd to claim that there's such a thing as a ""European civilisation"", just like there is no ""African civilisation"", it's a huge, diverse continent with entirely different kinds of people with divergent histories and cultures. To me, appealing to a ""European civilisation"" sounds earily similar to the people appealing to a ""white race"", another mythical construct invented to incite hatred and bigotry.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/7s63kv/sweden_increases_deportation_rate_to_morocco/dt2qoh3/,VirtueOrderDignity,1516650287

Secondly, there is literally only a single foreign primary source within a margin of 600 years of the early and high medieval period implying Serb settlement there, while at the same time we have a single source stating Croats settled there as well, so if something is probable, is that both settled there.

And the problem is that they find stuff to survive quite easily on the surface.

We have the traditional pique nique with all the food, bread, stuff it leaves on the place and on the bins, bins that are now transparent plastic bags since Vigipirate anti terrorist plans... Rats easily tears them and pick up the rest of food (a recent article says Paris will change the bin back to stop that). Also the restaurants leaves bags on the backstreet, nice for the rats too.

The Mossos tried to destroy the USA's warning about the attack in Barcelona

+ Puigdemont, Forn, and Trapero (former boss of the Mossos) denied the existence of the alert. 


+ The Police seized abundant material instants before it was to be destroyed


+ The Police told the Mossos about the threat to La Rambla the week of the 25th of May



The Mossos d'Esquadra tried to destroy the alert emitted by the USA about the threat of a terrorist attack in the Rambla of Barcelona along with thousands of other documents in the Besos incinerator, according to [El Periódico](http://www.elperiodico.com/es/politica/20180121/mossos-intentaron-destruir-alerta-eeuu-rambla-6567677). The same newspaper reported on August 31st about existence of of a note emitted on the 25th of May by the CIA that warned of a possible jihadist attack in Barcelona's La Rambla.


The existence of the alert was denied by former president Carles Puigdemont, the ex conseller of Interior Joaquim Forn and the former Major of the Mossos, Josep Lluís Trapero and labeled as a hoax, guaranteeing that there was no truth to the claim after the jihadist attacks of the 17th of August in Barcelona and Cambrils.


""El Periódico"" reported on Monday that two months after the denial, on the 26th of October, to be exact - the same day that Puigdemont announced to the Govern that he was going to anticipate the elections, one van and two Mossos patrol vehicles drove to the incinerator of Sant Adrià de Besós with the order to destroy a large amount of information.

The Police was tipped off and deployed 20 officers to the scene where they impeded the destruction of said information, which was impounded after producing a judge's order. The Police impounded large amounts of material, 36 boxes, in which they found the original copy of the USA's alert.

A file titled ""Report about a possible threat to Barcelona"" was found along with the original alert, which translated the text to Catalan and, according to investigators, was sent to various members of the intelligence department.

The file reads: ""Unconfirmed intelligence of unknown veracity from May 2017 indicated that ISIS was planning unspecified terrorist attacks in the summer against tourist hotspots in Barcelona, Spain. Specifically in La Rambla street"".

The original file came from the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC), who coordinates antiterrorist intelligence of American intelligence services, and contained clues gathered by the CIA.",,/r/europe/comments/7s87fn/catalan_police_tried_to_destroy_barcelona_terror/dt2rh6a/,James12052,1516651039

After inquiries of this newspaper, and after thoroughly analyzing them, the **Mossos corroborate the veracity of both documents. ""They're real, they haven't been altered"".**

Why did Forn and Trapero insist on denying that the US had sent the Mossos that specific alert? We have to search for the reason in the political context of the time. After it was disclosed on the same day of the attacks of La Rambla that the CIA had warned the Mossos about this eventuality, ""president"" Puigdemont vehemently denied it on the 20th of August: [""There is no relationship between international intelligence agencies and the Mossos.""](http://www.elperiodico.com/es/politica/20170831/desmentidos-puigdemont-forn-trapero-aviso-cia-mossos-atentado-terrorista-6254740) Likewise, Forn on the 22nd of August: (""We don't have contact with the CIA. We wish we did"") and Trapero, on the 28th (""It's a lie"").


Could the attack have been foiled had measures been taken?

From the information gathered in the last months by different Police forces, the answer is no. Firstly, because the Police and the Mossos concluded in June that the alert wasn't detailed enough to warrant credibility. Secondly, because after the attack, American intelligence services said that the trail that caused the alert in May wasn't related to the jihadist cell lead by the imam of Ripoll. And thirdly, because the Mossos have assured that security was heightened in La Rambla before the tragic attack of August 17th.",,/r/europe/comments/7s87fn/catalan_police_tried_to_destroy_barcelona_terror/dt2rig0/,James12052,1516651071

1805,"&gt;This argument is pointless to be honest

The ""binding"" vs ""advisory"" issue?  I agree — as I've posted in here before, there is no true legal barrier to cancelling Brexit: anything that does exist could be fixed by legislature.

The barrier is a political one — it'd be the end of politicians who did so.

&gt;She would be removed by her parliamentary party. The Prime Minister is answerable to her party, not the other way around.

Yeah, I meant it as more of a general analogy to illustrate that there aren't really any further formal limits on a government in power.  Like, say the Tories were AKP, Erdogan's party.

While British lower law and US lower law are similar, the ""high law"" upon which each rests are polar opposites in this sense: the US has a lot of explicitly-stated, interlocking limitations, and the UK has a system that relies a good deal upon on the honor system.

It's interesting to me in that I kind of take a hard, clean set of limitations in the US Constitution as a fundamental thing that must be there and are tremendously important, and which we treat as very important.  Yet…a good portion of it being considered important is theory, with limited testing.  After all, law is just a set of agreements between people that hopefully make them act in a better fashion.  What really matters is whether some dictatorial power shows up.  And while the US has explicit ""tiers"" of authority and builds her separation of powers on that, the UK does not.  Yet both appear to have functioned well for quite some time.

At the end of the day, I suppose, all law is convention.  The fact that a law has any force is only because people choose to follow it.

1899,"I am not sure I was clear, so to be sure, submitting an article to a non-profit publisher doesn't prevent everything that has been previously mentioned. See the ACS for instance (or the RSC for Europe) and their top journals, JACS and Chemical Science. 

Editors there are scientists. I am not sure, but I would assume the  Associate Editors to do unpaid work, and they are the bulk of the editorial board.

Editors are assigning reviewers, who will do the unpaid work of assessing the article and ultimately deciding whether the work is worth the journal it has been submitted too or not.

The applicants will still have to pay fees to publish colored figures though. They will have to make sure the article fits in the proper template, and correct mistakes themselves.

Finally, they may be able to access their own copy for free, but anyone in their institutions will have to pay to access it. Still, they (at least ACS) recently adopted a partially access free policy with Editor's pick article, and RSC might have switched some of its journals as open access. 

Finally, the problem with your solution is that career wise, doing what you propose is suicide. Publishing in open access new/low-impact-factor journals won't bring in many citations, and ultimately, that's what a researcher will be judged on for any application to positions or grants.

Hence why if there is not a big push from institutions to promote open access to scientific contents, it will not change.

Seriously, though, I think that this is just the article author getting excited about nothing.

First, [coastal underwater weapon use isn't new](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsunami_bomb)

&gt; Tests were conducted by Professor Thomas Leech, of the University of Auckland, in Whangaparaoa off the coast of Auckland and off New Caledonia[1] between 1944 and 1945. British and US defence chiefs were eager to see it developed, and it was considered potentially as important as the atomic bomb. It was expected to cause massive damage to coastal cities or coastal defences.

I don't see how this differs radically from previously-anticipated weapons.

&gt; The footage showed plans for a submarine that could travel 6,200 miles at 100 knots underwater

* Why would speed matter for a [second-strike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_strike) weapon?  It serves no purpose.

* The fastest submarine to date appears to have been [K-222](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_submarine_K-222), at 44.7 knots and I imagine was noisy when doing so.  If Russia can build a 100-knot submarine that can avoid [SOSUS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOSUS) detection, which is essential for a torpedo making a multi-thousand-mile run with a nuclear warhead, why doesn't she make *all* of her subs run at 100 knots?

* If Russia has a second-strike weapon that is actually viable, it is in her interest to advertise the fact, else it serves no deterrent effect -- which is the purpose of second-strike weapons.  She has not, ergo, she doesn't have it.

* There's [been some recent discussion about this](http://www.businessinsider.com/russia-mole-missile-nukes-science-debunked-2017-5), amusingly-enough, calling it tabloid alarmism...eight months ago, *also* in *Business Insider*:

    &gt;""It would be a stupid waste of a perfectly good nuclear weapon,"" Greg Spriggs, a nuclear-weapons physicist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, told Business Insider in an email. 

* Finally, given the context of this subreddit, even *if* such a weapon existed, it would mostly be of interest for targeting the US.

"" In Shinomaki city, WE HEARD that the Chinese were cutting off fingers and looting rings, watches (personal belonging of precious metal value).We couldn't let this pass. "" This is totally different from ""In Ishinomaki city, the Chinese were looting dead bodies"" because the correct translation would be ""We heard that this happened..."" aka a RUMOR. The translation were making it sound the latter statement seem like a fact when it was not. It is a rumor that leaked from their circle that leaked into their group.

[This part is identical to the Vice translation]So we formed the Disaster Area Safety Patrol. At first we armed with iron pipes, peppers sprays and tasers. But it was pointless since the rubble was full of potential weapons like pipes and golf clubs. We would go into the most dangerous areas and there wasn't a single police officer in sight. When we patrolled at night, we would greey the passersby. If they didn't respond, we'd try to strike up a conversation. And if they spoke Chinese, we were to kill them there and then.[/End identical trancript]

If we buried them in the rubble, then nobody would know. But in the end, we didn't see any Chinese people &lt;---- This is completely different from ""We could bury them in the Rubble, right? But thankfully, it never came to that.""

The real transcript never said ""Thankfully, it never came to that"". It said that they did not manage to find any Chinese. Therefore, we can see that it was all a baseless rumor, but they were still, from the get-go,  willing to illegally kill foreigners extra-judicially based on an unconfirmed rumor. They were never relieved to have not had to kill. They were never relieved to have not have found any Chinese to kill. That is completely false.

1945,"&gt;And 50% of them voted for Macron, see how this can be used both way ?

If you have a working brain you'd see why you can't. Getting the far left NOT to vote for the far right should be rather easy. Getting 9% of the far left to vote for the FN is a fucking FEAT! Getting 50% of the far left to not do barrage to the far right is an accomplishment.


&gt;All the second turn debate was about Europe, maybe it's something you can't grasp by looking articles online almost a year after the election.

And she still headed a party that usually doesn't make 10% of the vote. She managed to do 35%. According to your own argument a lot of peoples feel strongly about that point. 

&gt;Le Pen's EU stance during the legislative was shady at best but Philippot was still there and so the ligne Philippot. Voters knew that. :)


So you're comfirming that once she bevcame ""shady at best"" on that line her vote went from 35% to 10%. Thanks for confirming, even you should understand at this point :)

2068,"&gt; We need due process exactly because WE DO NOT KNOW WHO THE VICTIM IS.

I agree. But you can't assume that the justice system will always work.

The fact is that there are a lot of women who have been abused and did not press charges because of fear of retaliation aka ""victim blaming"".

&gt; No, it is not ok to make public accusations without filing police reports or a court case in an effort to discredit someone without evidence. That deserves shaming.

These are people that cannot afford a trial or who have been abused by people who are rich and/or powerful and who can make sure that the case never reaches court. If that happens, the victims will be blamed by society. This is what usually happens.

2107,"**A bit of context for those, who can't understand how ignorant these nazis are.**

I was writing on history of Silesia once becouse it's a fascinating region. For most of the history after civilisation reached these places, Silesia wasn't part of the polish state, actually it was asutrian, prussian or german since medieval times and Prussia/Germany had made the biggest influence on the shape of the society and economy in last centuries before WW1. After WW1 Poland got bits of eastern upper Silesia, and not everyone in Silesia was happy about it:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Silesia_plebiscite

This is the region where the action took place before WW2: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/Poland_Voivodeships_adminstrative_division_1930_Silesian_Voivodeship.svg

Post WW1 Poland struggled economically, and in many ways the central goverment was sucking money out of Silesia which was the most developed region for that country. Silesia was a bit like Netherlands in EU, they were rather giving than getting. And this was Warsaw's mistake.

Many polish-speaking Silesians who were cut of from the polish state for some 600 years and had little emotional connection with it felt a pro-german sentiment having fresh memories about the period in which upper Silesia had fast economic development. Also, many families in upper Silesia were polish-german, most people knew both polish and german languages.

Germans knew that, hence the occupation in Silesia was much more softer so at the same time many polish speaking Silesians joined Wehrmacht as the occupation of polish Silesia looked more like the occupation of France than the occupation of Warsaw. In countries were german occupation was softer, there was usually plenty of collaborators, and the occupation in Silesia was more like these places. Todays upper Silesia has a completely different ethnic background than in WW2 times, becouse communists put a lot of attention in the region, importing people there and so on, so Silesians scatter more and more in the polish society. However, there are still some of the traditional post-mining silesian families who were more oriented on Germany than the polish state since WW1.

Silesians in many ways have a different historic memory than the rest of Poles. Poland gave up on Silesia rather easly centuries before. Silesians had no memory of partitions (Silesia wasn't part of it). Silesians see the german period as a time of coal prosperity when their region flourished. And there was much less nazi astrocities done in that region. It's not like pro-german sentiment in upper Silesia was popular among the majority of the local population, but there were a significant percentage of these people in that region. It really was dependent on which volksliste category you were given with, if you ended up categorized as some kind of ""german"", and it this region full with mixed families it was easier, you were rather free from astrocities, but needed to join the army.

That attitude, those all factors, together with a large dose of ignorance in some cases grow into this. Seen similiar mental scenarios in Czechia and Slovenia or even Ukraine in which many saw in nazi Germany a chance for their own state project.

The thing that our current times add, is how far-right groups get close together interantionally to fight their common enemy - the liberals. It's a global division of our times. Far right today isn't about fighting neighbouring nation, it's about fighting what they see as ""left"" in their own nations. They should choose their L'Internationale.

If Spain's Government knew Puigdemont was travelling to Denmark ahead of time, you either submit an ""euro-arrest-order"" or you don't. They retracted the previous order sent to Belgium because Belgium's laws do not have a ""rebellion"" law. Denmark does indeed have a ""rebellion"" law, but it is intended clearly for military uprisings. The former minister said the Danish law was for clear acts of armed uprisings, and it would probably not cover the ""different kind of violence"" [sic] that the Catalan issue had and Spain's courts are pursuing Puigdemont for.

That's the situation in Spain, due to continuous underfunding for decades, our courts are completely collapsed, suffer low manpower, and using centuries old systems that haven't aged well. This translates into slowness, with cases regularly taking years to be even considered, and then the trials taking a decade.

This, along with political interference in the justice system, leaves people with low confidence in the system. These kinds of protests are the result of pent up frustration at a system that isn't working, and while they resemble mob justice, it happens because it is felt that the state apparatus isn't properly working at rooting out corruption.

There's a world of difference between demanding that the state apparatus do its job, and punishes criminals or even that a government resign, and randomly accusing individuals in social media without proof so they can be punished by the mob, without a working justice system ever getting involved.

I don’t know if this is true, but the lack of rebuttal by police or prosecution seem to confirm it is, as when TVN or Wyborcza lie about such things the reaction is usually fast

Yes, I agree with the rest of your post. Though I do think that even people not from Poland can see clearer then some Poles. I mean I’m still scared that Macierewicz with his Smolensk fantasies has funding and 1/5 of society behind them. I know normal Poles don’t care about that anymore, but well, we see each 10th in Warsaw and daily on Niezalezna that a freighting amount of Poles believe and care about the Smolensk religion despite all conspiracy theories being against the rules of physics. For me such fanatics can believe anything if they can believe that. And in Poland the fanatics are far right. In some other countries of Europe there is a similiar problem with the far left, sure and so public opinion and local can by biased to the left, but in Poland it’s a right wing bias, so not all Polish sources are reliable also. 

As for which source is, I see two main fake news sites in Poland. That is the scary right wing Niezalezna with a frightingly large following. And the left wing NaTemat, which is not scary, just pathetic, with their underresearched articles with many factual errors in most. Of the other sources, TVN24 is quite reliable as is TVP Info, though they have different views. TVN’s Fakty and TVP’s Wiadomosci however are much less reliable as they tend to rival themselves in choosing the least interesting political propaganda. Wyborcza is not as bad as the right wants to believe (after all they unearthed the reprivarization scandal in Warsaw, despite it being a PO scandal), but have a very persistent anti-church bias, which makes me mad despite the fact that I’m not religious. Out of the right wing, wPolityce is alls quite balanced. I’m half Polish, speak Polish, visit Poland often, but don’t live there most of the time, but you know, I read the media.

&gt;I really doubt all those neoNazi defenders are from Silesia. So all in all, the situation in Silesia might have helped this group form their ideology, but the latest reports on nationalist activity which is so extreme that it can be considered neoNazi, came from Wroclaw (burning of the Jew), Bialystok (well publicized xenophobic attacks with no reaction), Podhale (neoNazi marches through I think Myslenice) as well as some shockingly Nazi flags on stadiums, mostly in Gdansk and Wroclaw.

In my opinion you're throwing in one bag neo-nazis and other nationalists or groups with ideology based on xenophobia. The key difference is that (upper) silesian groups will much more often praise actual german nazi III Reich, while nationalists in other regions will refer not to german nazism, but some kind of polish nationalism, more or less fascist surely, but not actually german-nazi and not actually someone who was slaughtering Poles.",,/r/europe/comments/7rxfck/for_adolf_hitler_and_our_beloved_fatherland/dt21yme/,unfirednavaronegun,1516621956

An increase in quality is equal to a more effective utilization of resources. If prices go up for that reason, consumption will drop to a healthier level. Nobody needs to eat a ""giant Bratwurst"" of 400g on the Oktoberfest. A 130g normal size is healthier.

Well, hydrofracking would force oil and gas providers to Europe to compete with new sources.  That's good for consumers and bad for producers.

That is, it might be good for the EU, but it is utterly catastrophic for Russia.  Most [Russian exports consist of exporting oil and gas](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Russia_Export_Treemap.png).

That means that Russia has overwhelming incentive to ensure that this does not happen, via bribery, funding environmental NGOs in Europe to alter policy, or any other route.  She loses her major economic lever in Europe as well as (potentially) most of her income from exports if the EU can obtain reliable alternate sources.

The last German chancellor was an SPD man.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerhard_Schr%C3%B6der#Relationship_with_Gazprom_and_Rosneft

&gt;Relationship with Gazprom and Rosneft
&gt;
&gt;As Chancellor, Gerhard Schröder was a strong advocate of the Nord Stream pipeline project, which aims to supply Russian gas directly to Germany, thereby bypassing transit countries. The agreement to build the pipeline was signed two weeks before the German parliamentary election. On 24 October 2005, just a few weeks before Schröder stepped down as Chancellor, the German government guaranteed to cover 1 billion euros of the Nord Stream project cost, should Gazprom default on a loan. However, this guarantee had never been used.[66] Soon after stepping down as chancellor, Schröder accepted Gazprom's nomination for the post of the head of the shareholders' committee of Nord Stream AG, raising questions about a potential conflict of interest.
&gt;
&gt;German opposition parties expressed concern over the issue, as did the governments of countries over whose territory gas is currently pumped.[67] In an editorial entitled Gerhard Schroeder's Sellout, the American newspaper The Washington Post also expressed sharp criticism, reflecting widening international ramifications of Schröder's new post.[68] Democrat Tom Lantos, chairman of the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs, likened Schröder to a ""political prostitute"" for his recent behaviour.[69] In January 2009, the Wall Street Journal reported that Schröder would join the board of the oil company TNK-BP, a joint venture between oil major BP and Russian partners.[70]
&gt;
&gt;In 2016, Schröder switched to become manager of Nord Stream 2, an expansion of the original pipeline in which Gazprom is sole shareholder.[71]
&gt;
&gt;In 2017, Russia nominated Schröder to also serve as an independent director of the board of its biggest oil producer Rosneft.[72] At the time, Rosneft was under Western sanctions over Russia’s role in the Ukraine crisis.[73] Schröder told Blick that he would be paid about $350,000 annually for the part-time post.[74] His decision caused an outcry in Germany and abroad, especially in a climate of fear about any potential Russian interference in the 2017 German elections.[75] German Chancellor Angela Merkel criticized her predecessor, saying ""I do not think what Mr Schröder is doing is okay.""[76]",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/7rwgd0/germanys_spd_to_vote_on_coalition_talks_with/dt1sni9/,vokegaf,1516600780

2437,"&gt; the problem is when you have too many people connected that’s it.

In other words, always. Telecom firms rarely have enough capacity for their clients. What I was talking about is the lived experience, not ideal use-case. Yes, if the networks would be properly used within their maximum capacity, the latency issues would be minimal, but that never happens unless you're using the network during midnight, or some such, in the real world.

As to FTTH in rural France, are you kidding me? France is so densely populated that it wouldn't be a issue at all if there was a proper national program for it, its not a poor savanna country with lots and lots of empty space between tiny rural villages. Your government is simply copping out, probably to the benefit of big telecom firms, by going with 4G in rural areas. There are villages in Estonia and elsewhere in EE that have collectively come together and build out fiber networks for their villages and they are far more remote and poorer than villages in France, there's just no excuse, if you ask me, for the French government to go with 4G. And that's not mention that 4G networks still have a significant cost in equipment, upkeep and they still require a nationwide fiber network, but they just allow the companies to gatekeep the broadband networks more tightly.

Some people has already touched upon the subject but I would like to clarify some things.

Between the 60's and the 70's there was a housing programme called ""[The million programme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Million_Programme)""  in sweden. The aim of the program was that one milion new homes was to be built in the nation. This was achieved by the socialistic government building state owned housing in the boarders between rural areas and the cities where the available ground could be acquired.

Fast forward a couple of years and Sweden decides that it should become the world leading nation in humanitarian activities and thus accepting a lot of immigrants. The only problem was where to find housing for all of the immigrants but since there already existed a lot of housing which where cheap and easily available for state entities like the migration authority to access many immigrants settled in the areas built during the million programme. This obviously has lead to heavy segregation in most swedish cities and although not all of these areas have serious problems many of them have become breeding grounds for criminality due to the immigration politics failing in many other areas like education and labor policies. 

These kind of areas are not an isolated problem to Sweden although and as some other of my countrymen has already debated there are definitely areas in other countries which are much worse of. The main reason that this has got so much publicity is probably because Sweden has historically been seen as ""progressive, safe, wealthy role model country"".

2568,"&gt;  The point is, in case you still are missing it, that poland can't call itself prussia  
  
Why not? Prussians were a West Baltic tribe (and West Balts were intermediate between Balts and Slavs). Some of them were assimilated by the Germans, but the rest of them now is Polish, Lithuanian, Belarusian.  
  
In other words there are Poles, who can identify with the name ""Prussian"". Heck, due to living side by side all Poles are mixed and thus partly Prussian.  
  
So we have the exact same right to use this demonym as Germans. Of course it would be awkward, but not more awkward than in case of Germans calling themselves Prussians.  
  
&gt;or however the hell they call eastern Germany  
  
They for example call one of the lands ""Vorpommern"", but somehow, despite incomparably more tragic and complicated relations between Poles and Germans, than between Greeks and Slavs, we are not bitching about stealing our identity. In fact even if we would want to do so, they don't steal anything, because Germans are partly Slavic, just like Slavic Macedonians are partly Greek.  
  
And I'm actually happy that tons of Slavic names are preserved in Germany, that they have statues of Slavs and that they ""claim"" Slavic history. For example the best reconstruction of a Slavic gord is in Germany. And that's great (as Alexander ;) ).

2582,"&gt;Ive never gotten How people think having such a large flow of immigrants, to the point of outnumbering natives, make any sense? It just makes them less likely to assimilate, and less likely to view themselves as German or Swedish or British etc.


Well you have to stop thinking of ""immigrants"" with their norms/culture and start thinking about the natives. 

Like ""Germanism"" for example is the belief ""German people/culture"" are predetermined to war, and ""fascistization"" is the idea Europeans in general are biologically predisposed to become fascists.

There beliefs are why the first ""final solution"" was used [in 1941 as a term detailing how to exterminate ""germanism""](http://i.magaimg.net/img/1dm4.png) slowly over time via sterilizations and forced migrations.

Funny enough the actual German nazis were horrified by this plan and it is allegedly responsible for polarizing them

&gt;The book appeared in many pieces of National Socialist propaganda. The Parole der Woche's weekly wall newspaper included it as evidence that the Allies' war aims included the destruction of Germany.[16] The pamphlet ""The War Goal of World Plutocracy"" detailed the contents of the book, although with some omissions from the text that it quoted.[17] It was used in 1944 in a pamphlet, ""Never!"", which described Kaufman's importance:

&gt;""The Jewish president of the American Federation of Peace is no anonymous individual, no fanatic rejected by world Jewry, no mentally ill crackpot, but rather a leading and widely known Jewish personality in the United States. He belongs to the so-called Roosevelt Brain Trust, which provides intellectual and political education and advice to the American President. ""It is therefore beyond question that his book and its demand that 'Germany must perish' corresponds to the official opinion of the leading circles of world plutocracy.""


One has to wonder, did Kaufmans ""final solution"" to the German problem in 1941 inspire the Nazis 1942's ""final solution""?

&gt;**At the normal death rate of 2 per cent per annum, German life will diminish at the rate of 1,500,000 yearly.** Accordingly in the span of two generations that which cost millions of lives and centuries of useless effort, namely, the elimination of Germanism and its carriers, will have been an accomplished fact. By virtue of its loss of self-perpetuation German Will will have atrophied and German power reduced to negligible importance.

Kaufmans plan as he details it ""Germany must perish (1941).

Obviously while these people ""literally said these things"" you'd have to be a conspiracy theorist to deduce that ""wait a minute, is this related to the whites need to be a minority by 2050 meme?"" 

&gt;Ive never gotten How people think having such a large flow of immigrants, to the point of outnumbering natives, make any sense?

What do you mean ""natives""? There are no ""natives"". There have never been ""natives"", or ""English history"", or ""European history"". There never was a ""white identity"".

And then the trilogy of movies, a couple of spin-offs and a series of toys. I'm sure, toy ""Putin in the form of a troll under the bridge"" will be popular.

&gt;At the moment, social media companies are given too much power to define what kind of public communication is lawful and what is not. In many non English-language areas, for instance, Facebook still doesn’t remove troll content including death threats directed at named individuals or **agitation against religion** or ethnicity, even though this content is clearly illegal. There should be no debate over such clear-cut examples: they are dangerous and need to stop.

2645,"&gt; No they wouldn't, that's what happens to refugees when they're being processed in refugee centers. Figure out who they are, where they come from, if we can safely send them back, only then do they get asylum. 

No you don't. They are allowed to roam around the city. They are not locked in the refugee centers.

&gt; The Eastern Europeans are the ones who refused to do exactly that, who refused to make it possible to do that in Greece and Italy, or even in Lebanon and Libya. Instead they felt it was preferable to let men women and children whom they knew nothing about wander through our common travel area, because they'd leave anyway.

2647,"&gt;Yes? Who do you think the politicians are?

A choice between 2-3 people who can't possibly represent everybody's viewpoints accurately? I'm 100% sure that nearly NO politicians were ever elected for their stance on encryption backdoors. Ergo they are not carrying out the will of the people anywhere NEAR directly.

&gt;You seem to not understand how our democratic systems work,

I think you're the one who doesn't understand how they work. Imagine me making this same argument under monarchy. ""Well he must be doing what the people want because otherwise there'd be a revolt"". No, that's not how it works. Think about the future, think about direct democracy. THAT would be a system that actually represents the people. What we have now, is simply what we have gotten used to. Sure as fuck doesn't mean we don't need to change it.

&gt; the electoral college system isn't archaic, I don't think you know what that word means.

Old-fashioned and obsolete. It is in fact old-fashioned as fuck. The electoral college was designed to give power to rural areas, and therefore take away the voting power of some people, in favour of some other group of people. It is an objectively unfair system.

&gt;The votes go state by state, because the cities are massively overpopulated it should mean that the rest of the country has no voice?

Let me word this another way. ""because rural areas are underpopulated it means the city people have less of a voice""? Does that help you justify a shit fucking system that makes voting unequal?

People should have 1 vote with equal voting power to everybody else in the country. You are defending a system that makes one group of people's voting power weaker than another, because they live in an urban area.

&gt;Your argument is like saying ""well Clinton won a game of snakes and ladders so she should surely be president"".

She won the popular vote. As in, the people, LITERALLY elected her, and she didn't get in. 

In addition, by calling it a game of ""snakes and ladders"", aren't you basically admitting the representative democracy ISN'T very representative of the people? Because they can be manipulated and toyed with easily? Because urban areas don't fucking matter? The list of reasons why Rep Democracy is flawed.

&gt;That's not the game they were playing, she neglected states which she believed were safe and Trump went to those places and campaigned.

Ah so, Trump won the game of snakes and ladders really? Clinton won the people over, Trump won the snakes and ladders game by fucking about with the electoral college and under-populated states. Got it.

&gt;You get who you vote for.

In America's case you sure as fuck don't. And in EVERY other case you don't either, because you don't know what you want until it's brought up, at which point you might not want your current representative. Hence why we should have goddamn DIRECT DEMOCRACY.

Every EU budget ever has been established through arguments and infighting. What makes this one so special? What do you know about the EU?

&gt;Personally i think the next version will be better, as hopefully it will have learnt from its mistakes the first time around.

So mysterious all you people who foresee the imminent death of the EU, only for it to be reborn in a slightly different variation. Isn't an organization like the EU quite unique, being unlike a nation state, yet more like that kind of organization than anything else. Is there any other organization like it? If not then how likely is it that it will be reborn?

&gt;But let's not forget the core purpose of the EU - to make European countries so heavily reliant on each other, that wars between them would not be possible.

That's not what working towards a prosperous and safe Europe means. It's kinda like that, but the cause and effect go the other way around.

2696,"&gt; How did we cause the refugee crisis? What did we do to contribute? Please tell me. Let us enforce the EU borders, that's all we asked.

That's exactly what I'm talking about. How did the Netherlands cause the refugee crisis? Or how about Sweden and Germany, they didn't even join the invasion of Iraq in 2003. Their hands are clean too. Why don't we all get to do nothing?

But then you bring up the solution. Enforce the border you say. How would you do that? People in Turkey are smuggled to Greece, some will get through no matter how hard you try. The people in Italy are handed an even starker choice by human traffickers, either watch the dead bodies pile up on their beaches, knowing that some people must make it sometimes to go do who knows what who knows where, or come and pick them up.

And once  you've intercepted a person who says he's a refugee what is there to do but figure out who they are and where they are from, to see if they can be returned safely. When they cannot, like most Syrians can't, you end up with a rather obvious question. Why should some third country that is safe accept the refugees that we don't want in Europe? They too have politics, they too have xenophobes, they too have a local culture they want to protect.

Eastern Europeans do not see themselves as having any responsibility for the upkeep of the union, or of the world order in as far as it can be maintained.

The only thing the publisher really does is organizing the peer-review and setting a standard according to which the articles are judged:

In the context of peer-review, neither the authors of a publication receive any money from the publisher selling the paper nor do the peer-reviewers get paid for their work. Thus, the review process is mostly free of cost for the publisher but the publisher gets to keep all the money generated by selling journals. 

Other than hosting papers online, the only other ""real"" service the publishers provide - which may be wort paying for - is that they have created a ranking order of journals which can be used as a simple measure of a scientist's worth in academia. By focussing on other methods to measure a scientist's quality, the need to have such a tiered journal system could be abolished.

2768,"I 'd sure as hell prefer my country to be called Orthodox Ottoman Empire or Western Ottoman Empire but Greeks nowadays tend to not like Glorious Imperial Rule, sadly. They cannot fathom that most Greeks prospered during Osmanli rule, especially the merchant class and even more especially those from Asia Minor and the Pontus. There are scripts from Konstantinopolis during Mehmet Fatih's siege that read ""Better the Turban of the Turks rather than the &lt;I don't remember exactly what headgear&gt; of the Franks (meaning the westerners, mostly the venetians)"". Our ancestors preferred a Turkish emperor rather than being dominated by westerners.

Of course peasants suffered, both Greeks and Turks. The same way they suffered when the Empire was headed by a Greek (Byzantine period). Most modern historians would rather say that the Ottomans did not conquer the Eastern Roman Empire, they became the Eastern Roman Empire. They even kept the same system of governance (Themes/Sanjaks or Vilayets), the head of state called himself the equivalent of King and not Emperor (Basileus/Sultan) even though they were clearly emperors. Most Ottoman Sultans were taught to speak Greek at least to a basic level. The god-damn capital had a majority of Greeks living in it for God's sake. They paid an extra tax for being orthodox yeah sure, but they were exempt from military service which schools in Greece tend to neglect mentioning.

But, but, but the Janissaries someone would say. The vile Turks forced Christian boys to become slaves. The Janissaries at their peak numbered 60.000 men and were recruited from young Christian boys in the Balkans only at first, then they were mostly Turks from influential families as the Janissaries ended up having too much power, even installing their own preferred Sultan at times. Even when they were forcefully recruiting young boys, I repeat, from the BALKANS, they were excluding only childs and children of merchant families and technicians (carpenters, smiths, etc.) while NOT even recruiting from economically important cities (e.g. Selanik). Now, it is even more ironic for a Greek to call out the Turks for ""recruiting our children and converting them to Islam"" because the majority of Greeks lived in Anatolia and not in the god-damn Balkans. Those who mattered at least.

Greeks and Turks lived together in harmony in Anatolia for many a centuries until the young Turks political party appeared and ruined everything. Then Kemal put the nail in the coffin.",Pontus,/r/europe/comments/7rzr23/a_small_chunk_of_the_protest_for_the_macedonia/dt1a379/,CaptainTsech,1516579095

How can you be a barbarian and share the same culture as Athens and Sparta? 

What's happening here is the Skopians try to usurp Macedonia's legacy,so that they have a claim of identity as a pseudo-country,while in fact they are a mixture of Slavic races that lived in the Yugoslavian Republic.In fact a big percentage of their populatin consist from, Albanians and Bulgarians. They literally share no culture with Greeks,they don't look like Greeks and have no culture ties with anything resembling Alexander or Macedonia.The only relationship they have with Macedonia is that they are north of it geographically. Did you know that Thessaloniki,Greece's second biggest city was founded by Macedonians and had the name of Alexander's sister?

They could name themselves Eastern Albania or West Bulgaria and be way more accurate historic,but if they did that that would threaten absorption by these countries,so they had to usurp the identity Macedonians,since it was not ""taken"" by a country so they can have a claim of independence in national talks. 

But Imagine if Egypt wanted to be called South Creta  or Cretans because it's south of Creta, or albania wanted to be called Epirus because it's north of Epirus.

Beginning in the late eleventh century, during the Investiture Controversy, the Papal curia began to use the term regnum teutonicorum to refer to the realm of Henry IV in an effort to reduce him to the level of the other kings of Europe, while he himself began to use the title rex Romanorum or King of the Romans to emphasise his divine right to the imperium Romanum. This title was employed most frequently by the German kings themselves, though they did deign to employ ""Teutonic"" titles when it was diplomatic, such as Frederick Barbarossa's letter to the Pope referring to his receiving the coronam Theutonici regni (crown of the German kingdom). Foreign kings and ecclesiastics continued to refer to the regnum Alemanniae and règne or royaume d'Allemagne. The terms imperium/imperator or empire/emperor were often employed for the German kingdom and its rulers, which indicates a recognition of their imperial stature but combined with ""Teutonic"" and ""Alemannic"" references a denial of their Romanitas and universal rule. The term regnum Germaniae begins to appear even in German sources at the beginning of the fourteenth century.[9]

Therefore, throughout the Middle Ages, the convention was that the (elected) king of Germany was also Emperor of the Romans. His title was royal (king of the Germans, or from 1237 king of the Romans) from his election to his coronation in Rome by the Pope; thereafter, he was emperor. After the death of Frederick II in 1250, the trend toward a ""more clearly conceived German kingdom"" found no real consolidation.[5]""",,/r/europe/comments/7rx2yx/romangerman_king_heinrich_iv_waiting_barfoot_for/dt11vje/,SamHawkins3,1516571357

Interesting analysis here:

Are you expecting mainstream media to paste the ""Failed State"" on front pages. Don't. It won;t happen. It would be the admission that the the $5B the US spent on the coup d'etat in Ukraine was a comete failure in the end. And that even instaling a puppet government, including former emloyees of the US Govt. in the Ukrainain govt. did not help. 

Asking for proof that Uraine is a failed state is like asking for proof that red color is red. Neither need proof. Reality is self evident.

&gt; Guess we should all sing the praises of Hitler and Stalin for wiping away the old power based order of Europe and through their ""reigns of terror"" creating a new institution and rules based order.

Napoleon came much later than the Reign of Terror. You appeared to be comparing the Jacobins (in power during the Reign of Terror) to Hitler. You didn't mention Napoleon at all in your reply. 

The point of the Twain quotation is that the Reign of Terror was the reaction of a people to centuries of inhumanity. It is easy for us, in our modern context, to call it an overreaction. I certainly like to think I would have behaved differently. But it was the reaction of a people desperate not to be enslaved again, and indeed paranoid that they would be. The greater crime was the centuries of monarchy that drove them to this point. And in the end, the French Revolution remade the world and had a lasting positive impact. 

Meanwhile, while the rise of Hitler took place in the context of serious problems in Germany, the result was far worse than what came before. To equate the two is ludicrous.",,/r/europe/comments/7rxm1x/on_this_day_225_years_ago_louis_xvi_was/dt0uwww/,ainrialai,1516564423

From blissful obliviousness of how much they benefit from their relationship with the US, to psychotic tantrums about how the US is ruining the world by simply casting doubt on its continued generosity. Unfair criticism of the US, complete lack of self-criticism, and a general inability to give the US credit it's due seem to be the cornerstone of a lot of Europeans' worldview. Aside from this PubMed topic, another obvious one is militarily dependence. Europeans will lambaste the US for its militarism while simultaneously depending on the US military for defense. Europeans will gloat about how the US lacks universal healthcare, when the reason Europeans can fund their social services is largely due to the fact that the US military budget subsidizes the defense of European countries and their interests. The entire EU combined as just 10% of the militarily capabilities the US possesses, and the most potent military power in Europe is... the US, a country from another continent.

3038,"Hello fellow atheist! I am from the United States, so I have great respect for the republican form of government. Both constitutional monarchies and republican governments have great merits and great drawbacks. I do think that the monarchial form of government ought to be implemented wherever a relatively strong majority of people want it. For example, over 60% of people in Georgia (the country, not the state) want the re-installment of the monarchy. And a 1997 poll on re-installing the monarchy in Albania was rigged by corrupt officials in favor of republicanism - even a recent Prime Minister of Albania publicly admitted that if the referendum had not been rigged, the monarchy would have been re-instituted by a margin of at least 63%. After World War II, a strong majority of Bavarians and the Bavarian parliament supported the reinstatement of the Bavarian monarchy, which had supported the Allies - but the Allied occupation forces refused to let that happen. 

[In Romania, as of a survey 2 years ago, around 21% of the population would support a restoration of the monarchy, not &gt;5%](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.romania-insider.com/monarchy-restoration-romania-popularity/amp/). Ironically, this number could grow even though King Michael is dead (though it's pretty doubtful). For example, the crown of Romania was recently added back to the coat of arms. The Prime Minister Mihai Tudose recently resigned after he expelled the Royal Family from Elisabeta Palace and lied about their activities to make them look bad, causing large protests (Tudose is a former Communist politician, surprise surprise). The fact that Tudose lied about the activities of the Royal Family was strongly condemned by the majority of Parliament, and Speaker of Parliament Liviu Dragne declared himself a royalist in favor of reinstating the royal family. I'm curious to see what happens, although I highly doubt the number of Romanian royalists will ever again rise above 50%. It's not impossible, but highly unlikely. 

I think it's unfair to be so critical of King Michael, whatever you think of the rest of his family. He risked his life and the lives of his entire extended family to overthrow Antonescu. By overthrowing a fascist dictator and contributing hundreds of thousands of Romanian troops to the Allies, he is estimated by most historians to have shortened the war by around 2 months, saving countless lives. During the rule of Communism, he was in no position to start a coup. Besides, most monarchies go into exile when they are forced to leave - even the UK has plans for the Royal Family to join a government in exile in case the country is overrun by a hostile country. 

I would highly recommend the essay [""Monarchy vs. Republic""](http://historum.com/philosophy-political-science-sociology/53855-monarchy-vs-republic.html) by Otto von Hapsburg. Otto wasn't your average snotty, backwards Hapsburg - he organized the Pan-European Picnic protest in 1989 which accelerated the fall of Communism, and he was one of the earliest proponents of the European Union. In his essay, Otto closely examines the benefits and drawbacks of both the republican and monarchial forms of government, and he points out which arguments defending monarchism and republicanism are good and which arguments are invalid.

3105,"&gt;Does the British government have moved toward a stricter migrant policy?

No not really, they periodically say some words to placate voters but fundamentally they do not seem to want to decrease immigration. The Tory position seems to be to keep lying that they'll reduce it to ""10's other thousands net"" but they do nothing to get there and recently have stopped talking about any numbers at all because it looks bad. They don't get punished for it because there are no further right wing party to take votes from them, UKIP is an irrelevant shambles post-referendum.

I don't think any drop in (European) migration will come from planned government policy but will merely be the consequence of Britain being less attractive to would-be immigrants because of a worse economy, £ value and perception of being anti-European. The gap will probably end up filled by non-European migrants who ironically are those that based on poll data Brits are less supportive of.

The American public has been iffy about NATO since the Soviet Union fell, it was inevitable that sooner or later a democratic system would produce a representative that asks the question. 

Also, how dare Americans investigate a company that is breaking their laws! /s

&gt;Why not take Cuba

After the Spanish war the United States had a short presence, until Cuba elected a leader after which they fucked off? Admittedly there might have been (and probably was) some stink around it, but my point of comparison is history, not a fairy tail utopia. Compared to the other historical powers they acted well. After that Cuba had a leader that wanted nukes pointing at Washington.

&gt; Puerto Rico

As far as I'm aware Puerto Rico has never shown strong inclination to becoming independent or becoming a full state. There are benefits to being an oversea territory which they have enjoyed.

First, productive capacity is tied to population.  If the EU's population falls in half, she's going to have about half the relative clout that she did before.  The EU has an interest in keeping her clout.  Remember that everyone *else* is also automating, not just the EU.

Second, what you're proposing is that the productivity gains from automation be redirected to pay pension shortfalls, yes?  Let's assume that such gains happen.  Other countries -- with the exception of maybe South Korea and Japan -- aren't facing such a serious crash.  Other countries with a more-stable population will be able to say ""if you work *here*, I'll let you keep the extra money you make, rather than taxing it away and using it on the elderly"".

3339,"I really appreciate your feedback. And believe me, I never meant to insult This includes my below reply.

Doubt: ""...species number at risk have nothing to do with agriculture..."". In Germany, it has. Herbicides kill flowering plants. Insects have less to feed from; some are very specialized. Pesticides kill insects. [Reading sample](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/11/insect-declines-new-alarm-over-mayfly-is-tip-of-iceberg-warn-experts). Birds have less to eat... Food chain... --
 Then, there is liquid manure dumping on maize fields, as maize can best cope with the load. Excessive. From excessive pig farming. Free nitrogen runs off, changing flora composition by preference of N-tolerant plants. For what? Mainly for bio diesel and bio gas reactors. And...more pig farming. - Not to speak of antibiotics and multi-resistant germs. If that continues, even the human race will be endangered. By agricultural malpractice.

It believe you that where you live the area quotient between agricultural use and untouched nature is small enough to not have damage. Nature can regenerate. More likely, however, is that one cannot easily perceive it, especially as extinction time constants go by decades. -- Here in Germany, things are more concentrated. The number of insects is reduced by 80% (measured with bug traps by scientists) compared to 4 decades ago. When I was young, one drove 1 hour by car and couldn't see anything  through the windshield anymore. Now after 5 hours, the view is still good. As a child, I chased butterflies in our garden (suburb). Today: No butterflies no more. -- The trend continues in a scary way, if one looks at China. Over 4 years, I made many bicycle tours in rural areas. The pinnacle of wildlife I saw was a flock of 6 or 8 sparrows and one white heron. Otherwise: Magpies, nothing else. They virtually don't have any insects anymore. Not even flies. Not here: [meat markets](https://imgur.com/a/2ixaH). And not here: [bins full with organic waste in right center](https://i.imgur.com/0czRFh2.jpg). With results like this [Link](https://www.chinadialogue.net/article/show/single/en/5193-Decline-of-bees-forces-China-s-apple-farmers-to-pollinate-by-hand). The coincidence with chemical use was striking. I saw many ""sprayers"". With such results: [Chinese farms cause more pollution than factories](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/feb/09/china-farms-pollution). -- I don't want Europe to become like China. And I guess you should strife to not become like western Europe.

I agree with your last sentence about tilling. To 98%: Tilling is 100% there where you do it. Spraying is always accompanied by some washing out into streams and some wind propagation of dust. If the fields are big enough (like in the Palouse in WA, which I saw with my own eyes), this may not have any significant impact. The fallout still hits... fields. And yes, all these concerns are more related to insecticides than herbicides. I nonetheless believe this concept cannot be applied to Europe anymore. For simple resource reasons. Our nature is kind of ""depleted"" already. The US may still have enough to spend.

3360,"Read what Snyder wrote once again. First members of UPA were almost exclusively german collaborators, which previously murdered Jews in Volhynia. So it was far easier for them to do the same thing against polish civlians.

Also the whole quote:

&gt; Matters were much worse than this. The Germans recruited
about 1,200 fresh Polish policemen in April 1943 to replace the
Ukrainian deserters. Polish motives were local and personal: to
defend themselves or take revenge.85 Once they joined, Poles
could not easily change their mind: sixty who tried to resign on
10 April 1943 were summarily shot. Yet regardless of individual
motivations, this response to UPA attacks accelerated a
fateful escalation. Poles now aided German policemen as they
pacified Ukrainian villages. By July 1943 a battalion of Polish
policemen had been dispatched to rural Volhynia to pacify
Ukrainian villages. This was Schutzmannschaftbataillon 202,
the only such Polish unit, recruited from Galician Poles but
serving in Belarus before the transfer to Volhynia. This added to the powerful impression among Ukrainians that Poles were
collaborating with murderous German policies in Volhynia.86
That said, the auxiliary police remained heavily Ukrainian despite
the desertions of March and April, and Ukrainian policemen in
the German service continued the pacification of villages (often
Polish) suspected of sheltering Soviet partisans. Ukrainians in
the German police pacified Polish villages; Poles in the German
police pacified Ukrainian villages. All served the German policies
of maintaining local order and resisting Soviet incursions; few
could resist interpreting their experience in national terms. 

Polish collaboration was marginal, many of the policeman deserted, while Ukrainians collaborated on much larger scale.

&gt; La figura del trabajador pobre gana terreno. España cerró 2015 con 5,9 millones de asalariados que tuvieron algún tipo de trabajo durante el año, pero que en el conjunto del ejercicio no lograron alcanzar el salario mínimo interprofesional fijado para esa anualidad: 9.080,40 euros brutos en 14 pagas.

Checking this a bit more, I found:

* The number of temporary contracts is 7.4 million. [Link, see diagram](https://www.elconfidencial.com/economia/2017-07-06/precariedad-contratos-temporales-parciales-record-cifras_1404367/).

3455,"&gt; To be fair, the reason they were not in Romania was because they couldn't be.

Imagine something like this happened to the monarch of the UK. Do you think they would have let the situation as it was for half a century? I think they would've retaliated and took back their country in maximum 10 years. Our ""Royal Family"" didn't, though. They just moved to another country and went on with their lives, waiting for the communism to die. And after that, what? They came and expected to be reinstated or something? Hah, that's funny! Also, take into consideration that, AFAIK, they still live in another country :) AFAIK, they come to Romania only for charities or politics. As I said, I hate PSD and I hate corruption, but I would always prefer a corrupted official who doesn't try to hide it than a super-fake person who hides it well.

&gt; I think an interesting possibility for Romania would be a system similar to San Marino.

I think **the only possibility** for Romania would be taking some measures to make people go to vote. An interesting possibility for Romania would be to have more young people in politics; to be more liberal; to erradicate corruption; to get involved on the EU level; to have more partnerships with European countries, especially with Bulgaria, Hungary and Serbia (even though it's not in the EU yet). And finally, to be a part, at some point (if it will ever happen), of an European Federation.

&gt; they have a throne and are addressed as ""Your Excellency""

In my opinion, that's just ew. Romania's people are too close minded as it is. We don't need to add some more ass-kissing there.

&gt; would unite Republicans and Monarchists alike

You imagine something that isn't real. Sorry if I didn't write my comment clear enough. It may have seemed that Romania is divided between republicans and monarchists. The truth is it's not. Nobody takes monarchists serious and anyway, they are only monarchists from time to time. **FORTUNATELY**, there is no movement to change Romania like this and if it was, I would see it as hostile. 

I think Romania has enough problems already and the best form of government is the republic. An elected President, an elected Parliament and an indirectly elected Government (although, I would really like if the Government **had to** have members from all political parties, and not only). Maybe people don't always vote for the better of the country, but they still have a say in what happens. And I think that's a good thing!

You were talking about San Marino. I find it a complicated system and I don't understand the reason we would change it to that. You say they basically elect their monarch. Then why would we complicate ourselves to change Romania like that? What would we achieve?

From your posts, I understand you're a history lover and you just love monarchy. I respect that, but monarchy is outdated. If a country remained a monarchy from the past and the monarch is merely for show, then I **somehow** understand. But if there's a country like Romania, which hasn't been a monarchy for almost a hundred years, I think changing the form of government is not up for debate and it would be the stupidest choice ever.

I am an atheist, but ""thanks God"" it will never happen that a majority of Romanians would vote for changing our form of government to monarchy. ""Thanks God"" only a small portion of the population (I don't have statistics, but I would say it's way below 5%) supports this. And ""thanks God"" the Romanian ""Royal Family"" is a nullity and noone can or will ever take them serious.

It just deny Ukraine right to have weapons to defend:

`Providing lethal weapons would almost certainly encourage the Ukrainians to press for even heavier arms and escalate the fighting`

Author just forgot to mention how should Ukraine defend themselves without arms. Maybe US should just provide pen, papers and envelopes for strongly worded letters. It should guarantee Ukraine independence, because when Russian attacked weaker, poorly armed neighbor last time?

3533,"&gt;I had a nice screen from Samsung made in Romania.

This is a pretty bad example. I assume that screen is pretty old, because the factory that made it has been closed for 6 years now. And it was closed with a rather big scandal. Here's an excerpt from a 2012 article:

&gt;The Koreans from Hanil Electronics are in hot waters. On July 15th, after 5 years of activity, the Samsung supplier had closed its gates in the town of Biharia. With a scandal, because the 539 employees have called Territorial Work Inspectorate to force management to sign the collective employment contract necessary in order to receive compensatory payments and unemployment benefits. 

&gt;The company had a disastrous financial situation. On top of the unpaid loans of over €8 million, Hanil accumulated until March of this year fiscal debt of over 2 million lei over which the Agency for Fiscal Administration has put a part of the company's assets under seizure. 

&gt;And that is not all! Last week, police officers from the antifraud unit discovered that part of the seized assets have vanished after the closure of the factory, but also that the administrator of the company, Kim Hak Jun has continued to dodge taxes owed to the Romanian state, further pocketing 600.000 lei, representing social security contributions of employees, who now risk being left without any unemployment benefits.

I understand what you are saying though, but a 2020 target is sadly even worse. 

On a different note, achieving a 35% renewable energy goal is a very simplistic and flawed way of looking at it. Some EU States have no problem achieving that because they have large hydropower potential (Croatia for example), others would have limited gain from it due to having large Nuclear Powerplants (France, Belgium) and others that may rely too much on Solar or Wind power generation (Denmark) will have excess power during sunlight/hot days/windy days, which will they sell cheaply on the markets because grid power storage practically doesn't exist aside of ""dams"", and then will have to buy foreign power or increase the output of their coal/gas/oil powerplants during the night. 

Following what Denmark is doing is certainly not a sustainable way for the entire EU to work and we won't have capable grid power storage for at least 20 years (if ever. No, don't spam me Elon Musk's Australia project. That is a meme, a PR stunt and at best a tech showcase.).

That, unfortunately, is precisely the point: Humanity as a whole is being set back just because of one single person.

Given the instability of their political, economic and political structures, do you think it would be safe in this short term (say 5 to 20 years until we have a better picture) to arm a country with such strong quasi-fasist tendencies among some more influential groups? And then, regardless who is to blame for the situation, and considering [this definition of a failed state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failed_state) (sady Ukraine seems to match all criteria), would it be really safe to pour deadly instruments into the area?

&gt; Not safe for Russians, which makes it the right choice. 

Either you haven't read the article, have no idea about Russia or both. Ukraine has approximately zero chance against Russia. And that's when you round things up to the Ukrainian benefit.


Now, given that there are indeed fascist and nazi groups of considerable influence in Ukraine, if they really get the power to even dream of standing up to Russia, do you not see a danger to others? After all, the world is more than just Russia and Ukraine. Various Ukrainian nationalist groups have terriorial claims agains countries such as Transnistria, Romania, Slovakia, Poland or Belarus. American military aid to Ukraine could put both at odds with those countries. Some might decide to get closer to Russia. 


The situation is much more complex than just giving arms to Ukrainians.

**May:""We're leaving the EU, but not Europe""**

 British Prime Minister Theresa May has ruled out the possibility of leaving the Brexit, rejecting an offer by EU leaders.

There will be no second referendum on the EU withdrawal,""she said in an interview with the newspaper"" Bild ""on Saturday. Parliament had given the British public the choice and it had made its decision. I think it is important for politicians to deliver,""May said, adding in German:"" We are leaving the EU, but not Europe.

Your country remains ""committed to European defence and security in the future - without ifs and buts"", May said. She will affirm this message at the Munich Security Conference in February. Their participation in the conference has not been known so far.
Offer in the Union to remain declined

On Tuesday, EU Council President Donald Tusk, EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and Commission Vice-President Frans Timmerman's UK offered to stay in the EU, offering that the heart of the EU was wide open. A second referendum had also been discussed in the United Kingdom. Britain wants to leave the international community on 29 March 2019.

May told the ""Bild"" newspaper that Britain wants to continue to have a good partnership with the EU. It is by no means ""that the United Kingdom is breaking all bridges"". It is very important to her that ""Germans and Britons living here who currently live in Germany know that their status is secured and that they can stay"".

In addition, it is in the interests of both countries to maintain close economic ties for the benefit of prosperity and jobs - with ambitious goals. We want to negotiate a comprehensive free trade agreement and a security partnership,""May said.

They believe that Britain can achieve an end result with the EU that is good for everyone. ""It's not about picking raisins.""

3700,"For those who ask if there's any point to the protests in Romania because they don't seem to have any visible effect: 
Romanians were(and many still are) used to accept bad things without questioning what they can do about it. Romanians were silenced for a long time during communism and the mentality remained the same for a long time: don't ask, don't speak, pretend you don't see/ you don't know, don't do anything about it, but complain to people who also won't do anything about it. 
After many years, things have started to change and the protests have given people an other perspective. The protests have been empowering for Romanians who felt tired and sick of the corruption and people are finding their voices. 
Things won't change in a few days, mentalities change in time and there are still many who are yet to learn from these demonstrations. Besides, things are changing when the government knows that people won't just keep ignoring everything, but will anytime be capable to join forces and go out in the streets if needed.

Even ignoring Anglo actions against Europeans like the Irish and later the civilian bombings on Germany like Dresden, look at Asia.

Millions of Bengali victims starved to death.

And the English govt treats it's own civilians so bad even Adolf Hitler himself noted it in one of his speeches;

&gt;""And yet to speak today of England's World Power or of England as the master of the world, is nothing but an illusion. To begin with her internal situation: England, in spite of her world conquests is perhaps socially the most backward State in Europe. Socially backward that is, a State orientated entirely in the interests of a comparatively small and thin upper stratum and the Jewish clique with which it is allied. The interests of the broad masses are of no weight in determining the orientation of this State. Here again propaganda phrases must serve. One speaks about freedom, one speaks about democracy, one speaks about the achievements of a Liberal system meaning nothing but the stabilization of the regime of a section of"" society, which, thanks to its capital, is able to get hold of the Press, to organize and direct it, and to create public opinion. Thus, in a State commanding the riches of the world, having gigantic living space at its disposal, in a State with altogether hardly one inhabitant per square kilometer, in a State so blessed by nature, millions are excluded from these benefits, and live in greater poverty than the population of any of the overpopulated central European States. ""

&gt;""The country which is a paradise for a few, is nothing but continuous misery for many, that is, for the masses.

And if all of a sudden a British Labor Secretary, who, incidentally, as a member of the Opposition, is paid by the State, appears and says: ""After this war, after victory, England will have to tackle social problems; we will have to care for the wide masses,"" I can only reply, ""We have done this long ago""",,/r/europe/comments/7rtpbm/russian_tweets_about_monuments_to_nazi/dszwhcr/,MarquisDePaid,1516506857

Europe is not a nation. Europe is not an ethnicity. And European is not a meaningful way to distinguish populations. 

Europe is a continent with many different countries and many different populations.

In reality Europeans that move to another European country are foreigners in their new home countries. They are foreigners that increase that evil diversity in their new countries.

3823,"*thoughtfully*

I think that the author has misinterpreted what the quote intends.  The quote never said that the UK would ""rejoin the EU"".  He was talking about a future British relationship with the union, which is not clearly membership.

&gt;The former Remain campaigner said: ""I think that the EU itself is going to change, and I think it is almost inevitable that the dynamic of the single currency is going to drive at least some of the current members of the EU towards much closer economic and, to a degree, political integration in the future.
&gt;
&gt;""And I can't see the UK wanting to go back into that sort of arrangement.
&gt;
&gt; ""But we may be looking in a generation's time at an EU that is also configured differently from what it is today, and the exact nature of the relationship between the UK and that future system – whatever it turns out to be – of European co-operation is something that future parliaments, future generations, will have to consider.

Speculation follows:

Obviously, one way to read what he says is ""if the EU becomes an economic union, then the UK will happily become an EU member again.""

But he worded what he was saying ambiguously.  And he may have also meant something rather differently.

Right now, the EU looks to me to be a beast held together, in great part, via economic ties.  It offers markets, the benefits of scale, and access to higher wages.

That means that the EU is fundamentally unable to offer very favorable terms to the UK.  The cohesion of the EU as well as her authority over members derives from a single measurement: how much better-off a member is inside the EU than outside.  This bounds what Brussels can get a member to do, how much pressure it can apply, what its authority is.  If a member ever believes that it is better off outside moving forward, then it will leave.

If the EU gives the UK terms that any member of the EU would favor over membership, then it may be hard for the EU to credibly argue that she will not extend those same terms to the other member.  If the member thinks that it can get those terms, it will leave.

That means that extending such terms is damaging to the EU: it makes the cornerstone of her power and cohesion weaker by making ""inside the EU"" less favorable relative to ""outside the EU"".  She cannot afford to expend a lot of that on dealing with the UK, though she'd probably like to deal with the UK if she didn't risk her own cohesion.

The reason for this is because the EU is a confederation.  She has no legal authority to keep a member from leaving -- members are still sovereign and may leave.

However, if the EU federalizes, members will no longer be permitted to leave.  That eliminates the risk to Brussels' authority in extending favorable arrangements to the UK: a member can't say ""hey, I want what the UK has"", because it won't be an option for that member.  So offering favorable economic deals to the UK without requiring full membership no longer becomes an issue.

Like, imagine that Canada and the US had NAFTA as an option at the time that the US was forming.  Maybe Maine says ""the hell with being one country.  Give me what Canada has -- I'm just gonna be in NAFTA and have some defense agreement and so forth"".  If the US offers that, the US wouldn't exist as a federation.  But down the line, maybe it doesn't hamstring the US to have intermediate arrangements available for outside countries.

The other states had to threaten to impose economic sanctions on Rhode Island to get her to join the federation -- she clearly favored a confederation with trade over a federation and at the time only preferred federation to a lack of trade.  It could be that he's talking about once Brussels has gotten the members over the hump of federation, he believes that favorable, looser arrangements would become available.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/7rtx7t/theresa_mays_deputy_suggests_britain_could_rejoin/dszquoq/,vokegaf,1516499616

&gt; 
&gt; I think most of the major Asian powers would like to say otherwise.

I'll concede that you're technically correct. Asian powers don't see diversity in their future because (aside from Japan and South Korea) it's in their present. Except for South Korea, all the countries that will be truly rising powers in the next century are multiethnic, and while they *might* evolve into homogeneous nation-states much like France, Norway, or Italy have (by people adopting national customs, dialects merging or dying off, etc - this is how Japan went from a bunch of tribes to a nation between the 1650s and 1850s and to some extent how Korea formed too), there's no guarantee in the internet age that homogeneity will work. [Even Japan has seen some backsliding on its homogeneity into a nation of regional ""nations"", although Abe has been able to scare a lot of them straight](https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/rise-regionalism-japan), and South Korea is deeply stratified along political and religious lines after the exposure that much of their right wing was in bed with a shamanistic cult.",Fully automated luxury gay space social democracy,/r/europe/comments/7rqtap/the_race_for_eu_membership_source_in_the_comments/dszrgb2/,19djafoij02,1516500381

The Suez crisis is actually a pretty good example of the US deciding to not be imperialist.

It also sided with the Soviet Union (against the British) during the motion to discuss the partition plan with the UN. The Kennedy administration also publically pushed for the continuing decolonization of Africa. Oh, and the Americans threatened to cancel Marshall plan funds to The Netherlands when they threatened to engage in neo-colonialist repression of popular uprisings in Indonesia.

On the other hand, supporting global NATO missions requires completely different capabilities. Moreover, after Afghanistan and Iraq, such missions are generally seen to be parts of an American agenda that did nothing but create problems for Germany.

As of now, even though Merkel officially supports the 2% goal there's yet to be a politician to actually explain, why more taxpayer money should be spent on the military.

“Mon cherie,” says Brigitte, “C’est freezing over there. Take a jumper.”

“Non!” I am shouting, “Je suis un Jupiterian god! Et Jupiter was not told what to wear by his mother!”

“Mais, je suis not your mother,” says Brigitte.

“Ah oui,” I say. “Whoops.”

Alors, then we are discussing notre strategy for les rosbifs. Et I am saying they will wish to discuss Le Touquet, our treaty on migrants. As a result of their amusing belief people will still want to go there after Brexit.

“Oui,” says Brigitte, “mais n’oublie pas the ill feeling, still, from 1973. For I have read that a diplomat has said les Français had ‘screwed us on the way in, and will screw us on the way out’.”

“Mais that was just my predecessors,” I shrug. “And they screwed everyone.”

“Yes,” I say. “Of course I speak English.”

“Phew,” says Davis. Then he says he’s calling to discuss the big Brexit press conference, which is designed to showcase le enduring mutual respect between our nations. Et he just wanted to let me know it was going to be at Sandhurst. Because le EU needs British security.

“Because we’re better at fighting, aren’t we?” he says. “Because you lot are always running away.”

“Ha!” I scoff. “But I have seen Dunkirk.”

“Well, let’s not have a fight about it,” he says. “Although if we did, Frenchie, you’d lose.”

“Go to hell,” I say.

“Anyway,” he says. “That’s the theme. Eternal mutual respect. Got it?”

“Donc,” I am saying, to Frau Merkel, “Je suis off to le cas du panier Anglais.”

“Ze vot now?” says Merkel.

“The English basket case,” I say. “Et ils are making a massive fuss about how nous sommes not going to take them to the cleaners.”

“Because zey zink you don’t vash,” says Merkel.

“C’est une idiom,” I say.

“She is a bit,” agrees Merkel, and I sigh and suggest we switch into German.

“The fact is,” she says, grimly, “either they stay in the single market and we tell them what to do, or they leave and we take their City.”

“Mais I thought the whole point of the EU was that you didn’t do that stuff anymore,” I say, alarmed.

“Not like we took your city,” says Merkel.

“Oh,” I say.

“For cars or trains?” I say.

“No, no,” he says. “Just for a garden.”

Yes, the wall came down.  It was by *no* means a done deal that West Germany and East Germany were going to reunite.

The event of reunification could only happen if all four original Allies signed off on it.  

It was not a ""question of time"" until reunification.  Many voices in East Germany did not want to reunite and I suspect that those voices would have gotten louder as time went on.  I also believe that voices in West Germany would have gotten louder as the potential price tag of reunification became clear.

Make no mistake: if France had succeeded in slow-walking reunification, it may never have happened at all.  Bush Sr. does not get nearly enough credit for getting Great Britain and France onside during that critical window of opportunity.

He is not stupid, he very well knows that it can get them in troubles with the Spanish judiciary.

&gt; but Spanish government's, since they are the ones that jail people without trial for their political ideas. Stop blaming the victims.

Regardless of who is more at fault, the reality is that if Puigdemont keeps pushing the pro-indepedence politicians to break Spanish laws, more of them will be prosecuted and some of them will end up in prison. And the independence will still not be achieved this way, because the Catalan separatists just don't have the means to unilateraly make it happen.

I would speak differently if you were actually facing serious opression, but the reality is that you live in a democratic country, in one of the most prosperous parts of the world and while I can see that the Spanish government might not always be easy to deal with and the Catalan separatists have some legitimate grievances, are those really strong enough reasons to risk significant jail time?

Even so, doesn't mean that you can blindly assume the exact same for Russia vs. Nato.

&gt; Google: Proxy war: a war instigated by a major power which does not itself become involved.
Both powers were directly involved in this case. It would have been a proxy war if the North Koreans did all the fighting and China only provided support for them. The Korean war was a direct war between China and the USA, just not on either's territory.

The first google results are wikipedia articles listing the Korean war as a proxy war.
China supplied the North with ""volunteers"" specifically to avoid a direct war with the USA.

&gt; 
That's my point. It didn't happen partly because both parties had strong conventional armies and partly because of MAD. If the NATO only focused on nuclear forces and neglected their armies, the Warsaw pact could have made some smaller gains easier than IRL.

Which is exactly my point. NATO/EU forces are multiple times stronger than Russia. You're arguing that The Rock has to be afraid of a 10-year old snatching one of his toes because for some reason he wouldn't resist.

A couple of days ago, I did some checks on an article titled ""The middle class is bleeding to death"" in the German weekly DIE ZEIT [Link](https://www.ndr.de/kultur/Katajun-Amirpur-ueber-die-Proteste-im-Iran,journal1128.html), in which the situation in Iran was analyzed. I couldn't  help, but Spain came to my mind. This is what I found with regard to discussed phenomena:

* unemployment [Iran](https://tradingeconomics.com/iran/unemployment-rate) 11.7% - [Spain](https://tradingeconomics.com/spain/unemployment-rate) 16.4%
* youth unemployment [Iran](https://tradingeconomics.com/iran/youth-unemployment-rate) 29.2% - [Spain](https://tradingeconomics.com/spain/youth-unemployment-rate) 37.9%. Iran ist hit particularly hard, however, as 50% of the population are below 30 y/o
* PPP GDP, development from 2008 to 2015: [Iran](https://de.tradingeconomics.com/iran/gdp-per-capita-ppp) decrease 2.3% -  [Spain](https://tradingeconomics.com/spain/gdp-per-capita-ppp) decrease 2.64% (yet recovery from a very deep dip during the banking crisis)
* Gini coefficient: Iran 2006 44.8% -&gt; 2014 38.8% (improvement) --- Spain 2006 32.4% -&gt; 2014 36.0% (worsening to comparable level). [Link Worldbank estimates](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.GINI)
* Corruption: The governing PP in Spain generated in 4 years 60+ cases of corruption which led to investigations / trials [Link to Wiki](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anexo:Casos_judiciales_relacionados_con_corrupci%C3%B3n_pol%C3%ADtica_en_Espa%C3%B1a)
* Election fraud: The general elections 26-J (2016) suggest irregularities implemented by the scandalous company Indra contracted for the computation. A series of other suspicious cases is reported from a number of countries [list, link](https://elcomunista.net/2016/06/29/conozca-los-escandalos-de-indra-la-empresa-encargada-del-conteo-electronico-en-las-elecciones-del-26j/).
* Ultra-national clergy: Full account goes beyond this post, but Spain definitely has its share of a financially state-privileged church which goes beyond the necessities of / its contributions to the civil society.

In one country, the data are held to explain demonstrations and rioting with 20 fatalities, in the other country, they are great news deserving an A rating. What the heck.

"" all in one little news bulletin.  And as if that wasn't bad enough ""snow in June"" LoL.

So, in 1975 Thatcher viewed Europe as ""closer and closer cooperation"" which isn't so different from the ""ever closer union"" of Maastricht, which the Brits seem to be so preoccupied about these days.

This is not the case, you don't understand. I have friends with dark skin and I have no problems with mixing with people from other religions as long as I can perceive that I will be respected.     
I don't like immigration from certain countries, yes, but it is not because of skin color but culture and background that those people bring with them. They are a threat because they come here to prey on the weak, which are mainly women and poor Europeans that see how their salaries go down the drain. They get a good treatment here and they disrespect the only reason why they are given that treatment: that our society tries to respect everyone.     
Immigration itself is a dangerous concept. Elites allow immigration in Europe because they see it as cheap labor coming, docile ignorant cattle compared to European workers.

4406,"**In the last three minutes of the meeting, a stranger addresses the audience.**  
  
For the activists of French environmental organization Bloom, that was the ideal situation. Fishermen foreman Pim Visser saw them for the first time at a Brussels meeting regarding pulse fishing last year. Normally, he’ll walk into the same people every time, the fishing world is not that big, but in the last three minutes, a stranger addresses the audience. A fanatical man with ‘very radical ideas’ against pulse fishing. He is from the Bloom organization, which will not remain unknown for long.  
  
Whoever it is you’re speaking to about the pulse fishing ban, both proponents and opponents agree on one thing: Bloom played a crucial role in the vote. The environmental group depicts pulse fishing as a weapon of mass destruction. According to Bloom, the sea transforms into a graveyard whenever a Dutch pulse ship has passed and the fish will have burn marks on their fins after the electrical shocks. Scientifically speaking, all unproven statements, but the layman doesn’t know that. And most of the MEPs that have to vote, are laymen.  
  
The Dutch defenders of pulse fishing are resisting, but it is to no avail. Peter van Dalen tries, together with Jan Huitema of the VVD[Biggest Dutch party, liberal and in the coalition] and Annie-Schreijer-Pierik of the CDA[Dutch Christian party, coalition partner], tries to get Bloom on the blacklist of lobbyists in November for spreading lies. The European Parliament starts an investigation onto the organization, but it is still running at the time of the vote. Thus, the organization is allowed to come into the parliament. Adding to that, Dutch MEPs send an opinion article to the French paper Le Monde, but it is not placed.  
  
From an office “as big as a toilet in the European Parliament” Bloom-chairwoman Claire Nouvian and two of her employees speak with hundreds of MEPs in a short time. Enormously fanatical and with religious conviction she tells them that the world should get rid of pulse fishing. The most important argument of the Netherlands, that pulse fishing is better for the environment than bottom trawling, does not leave an impression. They are against both forms of fishing. Choosing between the two is to them like choosing between the plague and cholera.
  
**The French message was everywhere**  
  
French fishing organizations do the rest of the work. They see the Dutch pulse ships close to their coast as a big fat middle finger that they have to accept every day. When the Dutch still used the bottom trawling technique, they couldn’t come as close to the coast as they do now. With the pulse fishing technique, that got a lot easier and now Dutch ships are fishing in areas that used to be exclusively fished in by small French boats.  
  
When VVD member Jan Huitema arrives at his office the day of the vote, a big poster hangs on his door. A French fishing boat in an idyllic harbor. He knows the image, because he received a flyer with the same design when he arrived at the European Parliament. Everywhere people where distributing flyers against pulse fishing. The French message was everywhere.  
  
It was not that the Dutch camp did nothing. The evening before the vote Pim Visser and Peter van Dalen organized a meeting with scientists about pulse fishing. Just before the weekend they invited the Dutch scientist Adriaan Rijnsdorp from the University of Wageningen. But the tide had already turned in such a way that it was impossible to still be successful.

4421,"**“It’s done”**  
  
When Rijnsdorp arrived in Strasbourg, he noticed directly that he was in a hostile environment. Where proponent Peter van Dalen was in the lion’s den the week before, he now saw that his own den had been taken over by the enemy. People were holding monologues several minutes long, which scientifically speaking, did not make sense. How, as a scientist, could you ever refute those arguments? Especially as a Dutch scientist, who was under suspicion of being biased.   
  
Fishing-commissioner Vella of the European Commission made a passionate plea in favor of the Dutch cause that same evening. Pulse fishing is better for the seabed than bottom trawling and the Commission is after studying the scientific findings in favor of total legalization. But the hall was not even one tenth full at that moment. The reach of Bloom and the French fishermen was much bigger.  
  
Just before the vote, Peter van Dalen takes his seat next to his regular neighbor, Werner Langen of the German CDU. The CDU was always a proponent of pulse fishing. Until last week. Suddenly, Van Dalen heard his neighbor speak about the disadvantages of pulse fishing. Where he got that from? Perhaps the French lobby.  
  
At that moment, Pim Visser is sitting in the public gallery, together with a couple of his fellow proponents. Before the pulse fishing vote, there are first hundreds of other votes, but after roughly 20 minutes it becomes clear. “It’s done” he sighs. The European Parliament wants a ban on pulse fishing.  
  
**“If everyone in Europe only stands up for themselves, I’m worried for the future”**  
  
There are many sayings about what you could have done better. Now too, the key players think: “In hindsight…” And then they mainly think about a five or so years back. The fuel prices were high and the price of fish was low. Fishermen were close to bankruptcy and the pulse fishing technique was the lifebuoy. A lot less fuel was needed and thus costs would be a lot lower.  
  
In that time, the Netherlands got the most out of it: Every European country was allowed to let 5% of its fleet use the pulse fishing technique, but the Netherlands requested and got 10% from the European Commission. After that, the Netherlands signed up for another pulse fishing experiment, which is why roughly 30% of the Dutch fleet used pulse fishing now. The Dutch fishing companies where making profits again, but this was not exactly a way to make friends.  
  
That does not take away from the fact that almost all of those involved have the feeling that they have been had. Annie Schreijer-Pierik even refused to shake the French chairman of the fishing committee’s hand after the vote. “If everyone in Europe only stands up for themselves, I’m worried for the future.” It is a feeling that more MEPs have.  
  
On the bedside table of Pim Visser the book “Beïnvloeding in Nederland en Europa”[Influencing in the Netherlands and Europe] by Rinus van Schendelen has been laying there for months. He has not finished it, he’s been way to busy. “In hindsight, it might have been better to dedicate more time to that. But whether that would have helped…”

4428,"""...Nonetheless, Bolshevik leaders recognized the Irish, Indian (until 1929), and British communist parties as separate entities, as they did the Indonesian, Dutch, Korean, and Japanese parties, and allotted each of them separate representation in the CI.25 **Only in the French empire did communists replicate the centralized imperial Russian party structure during the early twenties. In Algeria, a communist party formed in 1924 remained subordinated to the French party, and like its parent body, opposed Algerian independence from France, much as the CPU opposed Ukrainian independence from Russia.**26 In this context, the question inevitably arises, why the double standards? If an Irish and Indian communist party could exist independently of an English or British communist party, and if Korean radical leftists could be organizationally apart from the Japanese, then why could not a Ukrainian Communist Party exist independent of the RCP? Why one organizational standard for the Russian empire and another for the British French and Japanese empires?27 The Ukrainian communists attributed the reason to the imperialist and colonialist attitudes that permeated the members of the CPU in Ukraine as well as its parent body, the RCP, in contradiction to theoretical pronouncements in its propaganda.""


[26] *The Vietnamese Party was also separate from the French. As in Ukraine, the membership in Algeria was overwhelming settler-colonist. In 1935 the Algerian Party separated from the French; in 1956, it advocated for independence. The Russians condemned the French in Algeria for their attitude during the twenties and backed the small pro-independent faction – the equivalent of the UCP they condemned in Ukraine. In 1922, when local Communist leaders claimed that a Muslim revolution would mark a return to feudalism and that a French revolution was a precondition of an Algerian revolution, Trotsky condemned them as having a “slave-owner mentality.” A.

Sivan, Communisme et nationalisme en Algerie 1920–1962 (Paris, 1976).*

total flow of Marshall Aid to all Western Europe**. According to an

You can of course elaborate how they differed

&gt;Yes , most Algerians have no reason to request asylum and clogg up the system. However AFD extrapolates that group to the actual refugees who are often better educated and have a good reason to come.

Well, lets take this at face value, that you're completely right, then what would having that sort of immigration do for their countries? I mean if they're better educated in that part of the world, do you honestly think you're doing favors to anyone by taking them here?

&gt;Why would banning sex toys not be an extreme measure ?

Far right measure, but I agree it's quite extreme in the sense, but then again native Germans have the lowest birth rates in the world so it might be necessary, after all there's not really good prospects for aging demographic which pays the taxes in welfare state with growing demographic of people that don't really pay taxes",,/r/europe/comments/7roook/germanys_farright_afd_targets_refugees_in_first/dsyttc0/,jafar55555,1516456871

Yes the Toyota Yaris is [the most produced car in france](http://www.lefigaro.fr/societes/2017/01/28/20005-20170128ARTFIG00021-la-toyota-yaris-voiture-la-plus-produite-en-france.php), but [French manufacturers still produce cars in France](http://frenchcocorico.com/automobiles-fabriquees-en-france-ou-pas/). Generally models with higher added value such as SUV, sedans cars and utility vehicles.  
Cheap popular cars (such as the Peugeot 208 and Renault Clio) are mainly manufactured abroad (in Turkey or Sovaquie) and only top-of-the-range models are made in France. 


The problem is that French manufacturers are more successful in smaller entry-level models, which are not much produced in France. That's why they're trying to move up the range, some models like the Peugeot 3008 and 5008 have been very successful lately and are made in France.



I think they should study and draw inspiration from Toyota's success with the Yaris in order to produce cheaper vehicles in France.

Nuclear powers have fought each other before. The USSR and China had some serious border clashes and they never considered using nukes. Israel was invaded by Syria and Egypt while they had nukes. China charged into Korea against the USA without fear of nukes.

4565,"As always, the problem is not how much money Germany spends, but how it spends its money. The EU already outspends Russia 3:1 or more (depending on what estimates you go by). The problem that Germany has is primarily lack of combat readiness, not lack of spending (Germany probably also should spend more, but not necessarily 2% of GDP).

The 2% target has no sound methodology behind it to begin with; some countries have separate pension systems for former soldiers and count that against the target (and thus get to higher defense spending), some roll pension spending into the civilian system. America funnels a fair amount of non-military R&amp;D through DARPA grants that contribute to defense only if you squint really hard (my own Ph.D. thesis, which was basically general purpose computer science stuff, was financed by such a grant). Plenty of countries could significantly increase their ""defense"" spending if they shifted their accounting mechanisms around accordingly. Then, much of US government spending is basically corporate subsidies for the defense industry; while the same happens in Germany (to a lesser extent) other NATO countries don't have that option.

However US military presence in Europe, especially in terms of actual combat units, is very limited at the moment.

More worryingly, the US public opinion has shifted a lot since the cold war, and there isn't much stomach to fight another war for Europe. 

Moving such combat units to Europe takes time, while it is expected that the Baltic states could be taken in less than 24 hours. Subsequently the question would be wether the US electorate would even endorse moving anything, but even if they would, by the time any of it would be in position the Russians would be standing at the German border.

4744,"Well actually it's been approved by a smaller European committee consisting of 30 European specialists on fishing. They approved the request for going up to 25%. 5 voted against increase. This happend in two stages, additional 5% and 15%. They 'broke the law' (btw there is no law about this) by only 3%. Be my guest to look it up in the EU meeting logs.  They allowed it so more research can be done. 

All research can not support the claims of he French (they did not research it). 

However a country, thought it was better to vote with all 751 politicians, some of them who dont even have a sea, on the specific scientific subject of pulse fishing.

It became a feels over reals voting party. 

With an investment of 600.000 euro per trawler, we can easily say it's a big investment for all those small fishermen. 

I also what I don't understand is why the Dutch would research 8+ years and millions of money on it if it does what the French say. It's not logical as the Dutch has a far greener political view and actions than France. (nuclear power plants are still the main source of power in  France) The Dutch actually reached their climate goals as the French went to challenge their climate goals in a lobby. (Google it).

 Its a southern European habbit to strike when something does not go according to plan. (Google France strike statistics). 

I truly believe that in the end its all about money. By stopping advancements you can keep what you have and don't need to invest. 

It would be funny that after 10 years some French fishermen's purchases the pulse fishing technology and uses them because its better.

4762,"&gt;Yes because not getting into the EU and war in Europe are in the interests of the Serbian people.

The war is not likely to be ended by the sanctions, while its economic effects will be felt now - eight years before Serbia is going to enter the EU at the earliest.

 &gt;Plus I would question the benefits of being close to Russia at all. Look at us, all our close links to Russia have brought us is Russia bribing our politicians so they make unfavorable deals with it. 

We haven't been close to Russia at all. Virtually all important decisions concerning Russia have gone against them. All major energy projects were cancelled under foreign pressure.

&gt;We buy the most expensive Russian gas in Europe despite the bratushki crap. One of our officials sneakily signed a 1 billion euro deal for that NPP reactor despite negotiations not having been finished. So when we refused to honour that deal we got sued and had to pay for a useless reactor.

I don't think we can blame Russia for our politicians being incompetent. And the claim that Bulgaria pays the most expensive gas is false.

&gt;We buy Russian planes that have very expensive upkeep and we're forced to repair them in Russia despite other countries having cheaper offers. 

Bulgaria has not been buying planes in Russia for many years.

&gt;Russia has no allies, just naive states that it exploits. The Eastern European countries that have realised this are doing better than the ones who haven't.

You do know about correlation not being the same as causation.

There is an optimist who believes that Britain can be reformed to the point where it'll fit in with the rest of Europe. LoL

&gt; Mr Lidington, a former Europe minister who campaigned for Remain, told The Daily Telegraph: “I think that the EU itself is going to change, and I think it is almost inevitable that the dynamic of the single currency is going to drive at least some of the current members of the EU towards much closer economic and, to a degree, political integration in the future.

&gt; “And I can’t see the UK wanting to go back into that sort of arrangement.

Now, that's a clever plan. First they leave because they oppose political integration and then they come back after political integration has succeeded without them. This seems like some psychological trick to outwit British resistance to political integration. /s

&gt; differences between immigrants (as a single aggregated category) and the

&gt; and income decreased the immigrants’ higher risks of crime and

&gt; explained by the high proportion of young men and low-median income
&gt; level of immigrants. These factors explained even less differences between

2. “But we may be looking in a generation’s time at an EU that is also configured differently from what it is today, and the exact nature of the relationship between the UK and that future system – whatever it turns out to be – of European co-operation is something that future parliaments, future generations, will have to consider.

3. “I don’t think the EU in 20 years’ time is going to look the same as the EU of today.”

4. “I think it’s a red herring to be saying ‘perhaps we’ll change our minds about going back into the EU in something that looks at all like the thing we’re leaving today. I don’t see that as happening.”

5. “When they take their place here they will seek to improve or undo what we’ve done and make it work for them,”

5028,"&gt;No, you're wrong again. Essentially there were two main ""armies"" in NDH, one was the Ustaše Militia, the other was the Home Guard - the regular conscripted army. Home Guard had most of the people, but it was a disorganized, distrusted and ineffective force, especially after chunks of Dalmatia were ceded to Italy. It got so bad (or good, depending on who you ask) that Partisans basically used the Home Guard as their backup resource - from men to ammo to intelligence (infiltarations were many, so in that sense Ustaše were right not to trust them).

Im not talking about the NDH army, i was talking about the Ustashe militia. I just misread the membership.

Still, 100.000 members on 3.3m population is a lot.
&gt;If you're looking for morality in WWII, explain to me how most of Europe folded to the Axis or was ""neutral"" with Axis by 1942? FFS even the Soviets were allies with them for a good long while... until they were threatened in turn. Very few nations that weren't existentially threatened get to moralize.

Even the Soviets?
Stalin was as much of a mad dog as Hitler was, he was powerhungry as hell before the actual war with the Nazis started. Poland had Uprisings, Serbia had uprisings etc. folding in the actual war doesn't mean you go oh well they won, lets become genocidal maniacs! when they win.  So no, again, not an excuse.  

&gt;Yes, I completely agree. If Ante wasn't a retarded terrorist who achieved nothing at all... or if Broz wasn't a bloody communist... but, wishing on ""if only"" is rather useless. All I'll say is that if you're so stupid and incompetent and savage that your own people turn on you and bring you down, and by your own people I mean ""half-literate bushwhacking communists led by a locksmith playboy who liked to moonlight as a revolutionary dictator""... /headdesk

You know that wouldn't happen if Nazis didn't start losing the war, those same people were happy to welcome Hitler to Zagreb and stand idly while NDH forces went mini-Hitler on Jews,Serbs and Roma, even some Croats.  

&gt;As for Tonson, it goes - 150 Euro or one month of jail for every instance. The problem is more in that it's part of ""prekršajni"" instead of ""kazneni"" zakon (most of the time), and that attempts to move it into kazneni are usually done by people who see nothing wrong in waving USSR flags &lt;.&lt;

5055,"I'm somewhat skeptical of the claim that US regulatory policy back in the 60's and 70's was ever that in tune with public opinion. The theme in that piece is that European regulatory regimes are converging on the regime that the US used to have, which doesn't seem realistic. 

One of the things it says is that the US had a de facto precautionary principle back in the 60s and 70s

&gt;Ironically, notwithstanding strong American criticisms of the EU's use of the precautionary principle to prevent or delay the approval of GMOs, ""no country has so fully adopted the essence of the precautionary principle in domestic law as the United States.""[5] The precautionary principle in American regulation of food safety was enshrined in the Delaney clause to the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, which banned the use of any food additive if tests revealed that it caused cancer in either laboratory animals or humans on the grounds that such chemicals could cause irreversible harms. [6] 

&gt;As noted at the outset of this paper, the precautionary principle, though never an explicit component of American law, also underlay much consumer and environmental policy-making invthe United States from the mid 1960s through the mid 1980s. In America it was also appliedvselectively; just as in Europe, focusing on the prevention or those harms or dangers about whichvthe public was most worried. In the case of the United States, these primarily were associated
with the role of chemicals as potential carcinogens. In Europe, it has been applied in the cases of mad-cow disease and GMOs, both of which have in common the impact of agricultural production on public health.

Like that's just not the precautionary principle in the way that the EU uses it in any sense

2. Irish mostly speak English, as a result of oppressive linguistic policies. If you want to argue against its existence, go ahead I guess. 

Most nations in Europe have seceded at one point or another, and most have minorities left over (usually in cities) from their former rulers. That is my precedent. 

Of course, many large nations, habituated to using brute force, don't like this, and the minorities left over from their rule are used as an excuse to use yet more brute force (Hitler with Greater Germany, Putin with Russia).

5243,"&gt; There is agreement to a certain extent among scholars: it has been suggested that Finno-Ugric tribes arrived in the Baltic region from the east or southeast approximately **4000–3000 BC** by merging with the original inhabitants, who then adopted the proto-Finno-Ugric language and the Pit–Comb Ware culture of the newcomers. The members of this new Finno-Ugric-speaking ethnic group are regarded as the ancestors of modern Estonians.[6] The Y-chromosomal data has also revealed a common Finno-Ugric ancestry for the males of the neighboring Balts, speakers of the Indo-European Baltic languages. According to the studies, Baltic males are most closely related to the Finno-Ugric-speaking Volga Finns such as the Mari, rather than to Baltic Finns.[7] The results suggest that the territories of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have been settled by Finno-Ugric-speaking tribes since the early Mesolithic period. [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltic_Finns)  

And 

&gt; The early mesolithic Pulli settlement is located by the Pärnu River. It has been dated to the beginning of the **9th millennium BC**. The Kunda culture received its name from the Lammasmäe settlement site in northern Estonia, which dates from earlier than 8500 BC. [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Estonia#Mesolithic_Period)

Also interesting:

&gt; However, recent analysis of ancient DNA suggests that the carrier of the Comb Ware was Uralic peoples. Mazurkevich et al.(2014)[7] confirmed the presence of haplogroup N1a1 (Y-DNA), which characterizes Uralic peoples, in the Pit–Comb Ware culture with a sample from the Late Neolithic site (dating from the middle of 3rd millennium BCE) of Serteya II in the Smolensk region of Russia, near the Belarussian border. The oldest Comb Ceramic is found in the remains of Liao civilization - xinglongwa culture (BC 6200 - 5400 BC) -.[3] And, in recent genetic analysis of ancient human bones excavated from the remains of Liao civilization (Hongshan culture etc.), haplogroup N1 (Y-DNA) was found with high frequency of 60-100%.[8] So it is considered that **Uralic peoples migrated from northeastern China to Europe through Siberia** with Pit-Comb Ware culture.[9] [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pit%E2%80%93Comb_Ware_culture#Language)

5257,"&gt;We have an open invitation to become a part of by far the strongest military alliance in the world. All our neighbours are there already. It is, as it is, the best possible guarantee that the world today can give that the country is safe from outside attack.

And who might attack us, if not them? Joining NATO to get protection from NATO seems less like joining an alliance and more like paying a protection racket. Now, that might be a rational choice, but let's not sugar coat it. 

&gt;Law enforcement was the first target of the terrorist groups because the law enforcement is the only one in position to fight back. Not all Albanians were criminals that had issue with our law enforcement, and yet basically all Albanians wanted independence.

It's a different culture over there. The economy was always fucked up, and the criminals actually became their champions. A ""normal"" family in Serbia is proud when their children go to be doctors, lawyers whatever. People in rural Kosovo got social status from family that held rank in criminal organizations. 

&gt;They have him as their leader now. Kosovo is not ours for 18 years now. We had plenty of time to change, they didn't want to be with us under Rugova too. In a sense, it is the fault of our policy of endless confrontation that they radicalised and went with Thaci.

So what we should have done? Just turn a blind eye to all the criminal shit? 

It's true that they wanted out for a long time, but that's not because we weren't a liberal society. They have fucking blood feuds over there.

&gt;Don't forget that we are a group of people that have Vučić as our leader.

I'm not sure how we can compare the two. I'm not a fan of the man, mostly ambivalent, but he's a reformed nationalist fuck, not a plain criminal in a suit. 

&gt;Actually, they are saying that continously for almost 2 decades now. We are not really given the opportunity to know what would people think without politicians almost unanimously telling them how they should feel about this.

I think you're mistaking the effect for the cause here. Politicians are saying that because it sells. Go tell the people that it's all our fault, that that we needed to be more liberal for the Albanians to like us. It's political suicide, and for a good reason. 

&gt;For one, I don't think Kosovo was taken. I think we lost it due to our own stupidity and stubborness.

Was there a foreign military aggression or not? 

&gt;How many people exactly? How many people would still feel like it hadn't they been exposed daily to nationalistic lies for 30 years now? How many people would still feel like it if they knew just how expensive this status quo is.

More than enough people, me thinks. That's why they're sugarcoating the Kosovo recognition thing. If everybody was honest that recognizing Kosovo, among other things like relations with Russia, is a requirement for joining the EU, you'd get much more pushback. ",Rep.

5271,"&gt;funnily enough, Autocracies are better at quick reforms than Democracies. 

Quick but low quality - one size fits ~~all~~ almost nothing, without taking into account local conditions, scale, and cost. Planting corn north of Soviet Polar Circle, smelting iron in every Chinese backyard, planned famines in the most fertile regions etc. You need deep and detailed knowledge of who needs what and where to account for local specifics. Multi-level self-regulating system can have that knowledge, one ruler at the top cannot.

An example of similar phenomenon is [""retard strength""](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/m415c/is_retard_strength_a_real_thing_has_this/) - a lot of force but no feedback or refinement, no adjustment of scale / understanding when to stop.

Note also that democratic system can go into authoritarian mode in case of emergency/war and come back (much like standard humans can apply full strength in life or death situations), but authoritarian system cannot go into self-regulation/democracy mode at all.

&gt;for one simple reason, all you need to do necessary reform is a competent ruler. 

One competent ruler at the top is not enough, because of the complexity and rate of change in the modern economy/society. Even few-several centuries ago it was not enough. Gods-pharaohs were almost OK for city-states that did not change for millennia. Now, if only there was a system of selecting competent rulers at every level...

&gt;why are you comparing democracy with dictatorship ? you know, there are many other forms of government.

... And yes, such systems were/are attempted with mechanisms of self-renewal other than democracy. But they do not last longer than ~2 generations. Deng Xiaoping had the vision to [institutionalize the renewal of leadership](http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/686141 ) in Chinese Communist Party in 1980s, and things went *really* well after that. Nth generation agreed to step aside and clear the road for N+1st; they had new ideas matching the new reality. (Just like things went relatively well for USSR in 1960s.) But N+1st generation of leaders [recently decided to extend age limits rather than to leave](https://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2016/11/01/for-chinas-leaders-age-cap-is-but-a-moving-number/), because everything is going so well. It does now, but things eventually change.

This is why it should not be up to the rulers to decide when they need to leave. Or you end up with honored undead in charge, and a society to match.",🏴 Ave Discordia,/r/europe/comments/7regjb/in_russia_dismissed_official_commits_suicide_by/dsxns6t/,Idiocracy_Cometh,1516391052

5275,"&gt;Who is ""we"" in this scenario? Europe? Finland? From the perspective of a Latvian, my countries interests and Americas interests co-align. USA protects our tiny country from becoming a Russian puppet and the United States gets to weaken the standing of Russia in the world.

""We"", aka. Europe and EU in general that is now in a situation where a Russia is an enemy instead of a partner. Just because Americans say NATO is the only option to stop Russia from conquering the world doesn't mean it's actually true. It was obvious that Eastern Europe wanted to stay away from Russia and US took advantage of that with our support. We could have even formed our own EU defense alliance and not destroy our relations to Russia just to appease US. We could have acknowledged Russian geopolitical interests and taken them into account so this kind of situation could have been avoided in the first place. 

&gt;The United States had no obligation to spend insane amounts of money to prop up a country ruled by a corrupt oligarch elite. This is the real world, there is a middle ground between offering an olive branch and fixing someones mistakes.

The US gave Russia money because it wanted them to transfer into a market economy, aka. to a model where they happily accept American hegemony and could use cheap American loans to build themselves into a country that only cares about consuming junk and generating wealth for supranational corporations. Russians aren't idiots, so they saw through this bullshit and rather went their own way. 

&gt;As for NATO expanding eastwards, why shouldn't it? Countries east of Germany willingly joined NATO, why should the US value Russian interests over real democracies that want to be allied with them.

US doesn't, and that's why Europe is currently at this state. If US can make every European country their ally, why on earth wouldn't they do it, even if it pisses off Russia? Russia is not a potential threat to them, it's a potential threat to Europe. It's not their issue. Having this much influence over the developed world means that they can do completely unjustified stuff like Iraq war without anyone saying a word... Name one country that has waged war as much as US since the end of Cold War? You can't. And what did Europe do? Nothing. We SUPPORTED them. The reality is that for US, the Cold War never ended. They still spread their own destructive worldview and economic model just like they did during the Cold War. 

The question is, **why is EUROPE blindly buying all this?** We are the ones who suffer from this, not US. Why are we undermining our own armies for the sake of US? Why are we ruining our relations to our other fellow Europeans for the sake of US? Why are we tolerating Islamic terrorism from countries destabilized by US? Why are we allowing our countries and people to be sold for corporations and banks? Why? 

&gt;That sounds like a definition of a satellite state, look what happened when Ukraine tried to leave Kremlin's orbit.

Russia took Crimea. Pre-2014 situation was completely sufficient for Russia and Russia wouldn't have attacked Ukraine if that situation had persisted. I mean, obviously it wasn't that for the Western part of Ukraine, hence the coup, but the West shouldn't have taken advantage of that. Ukraine also fucked up with their politics, both before 2014 and afterwards. What did US do after Cuba aligned with USSR? Tried to invade it. For countries the size of Russia or US (or China), it's pretty normal to resort to hard power if it's seen as necessary. 

[Henry Kissinger: To settle the Ukraine crisis, start at the end](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/henry-kissinger-to-settle-the-ukraine-crisis-start-at-the-end/2014/03/05/46dad868-a496-11e3-8466-d34c451760b9_story.html?utm_term=.2368491377f0)


&gt;US has been trying to get Europe to become independent for quite a while so they can focus on their interests in the South East Asia. It seems to me that Europe is on it's way to become more military independent and the US wants that.

NATO is still here, and many new countries like Sweden and Finland are keeping the option open. The anti-Russia narrative is still alive and Europe is still aligned towards US. Trump's inauguration as the president has changed the 	
mindset a little bit, but I don't think anything too radical will happen in the near future. And even if Europe does indeed form its own military, it doesn't change anything if European countries are still blindly aligned towards US. 

&gt;Your whole narrative revolves around Russia being a superpower and the rest of the world having to give them space so they do not declare war on their neighbors. EU's army and economy dwarfs Russia not accounting for nukes, which quite frankly cannot be used to negotiate anything other than an apocalypse.

EU has no army and many European countries have relatively small armies nowadays. Russia on the other hand has huge and constantly growing modern military almost entirely home produced. Undoubtedly Russia would make gains if a war would ever break out, even if they would eventually lose. Russia might not be a superpower anymore, but it's still a major power in Europe and its interests should be taken into account. If we don't, it leads to crisis, as we've seen in Ukraine and Georgia... It's all about making compromises and making wise diplomacy. If our mindset is that Russia must either play by our rules or not play at all, of course Russia is against it... 

&gt;Why should German, French and Eastern European interests be second to Russian interests? My country wants to be a part of the EU, the EU wants us to be a part of the EU. Russia does not get to have a say in this because they are not USSR, they simply are not powerful enough to dictate anyone besides their satellites.

Which one is more beneficial for Europe: A hostile Russia, or a cooperative Russia? Because the kind of politics you described is how you make a hostile Russia. We don't have to choose BETWEEN Russia and US. We could do business with both. But now we won't because we blindly drive American interests and oppose Russian ones...

5307,"&gt;It was not fast - there were always lines, 

You have to take into account the fact that McDonald's appeared before the age of the internet, when fast didn't mean ""pretty much instant"" as it does today. Fast food is considered fast when compared to traditional restaurants, i.e. where you sit down, wait 5-10 minutes for someone to take your order, then another 30-40 minutes for your food to arrive. Even at a relatively crowded McDonald's location, I doubt you'd wait more than 10-15 minutes for your food. McDonald's staff are actually regularly tested with stopwatches for management to see how long it takes on average from the moment the customer places the order to the moment he gets the food. Employees can be penalized or even fired if they are too slow. 

&gt;and you had (and still have to) to wait for your food to be made, as opposed to bistros that had already made warm food ready for you.

Well, fast food doesn't mean pre-made food. Of course it's much faster to get a pre-made sandwich or something at a gas station, but that's not a restaurant. Also, as bad as McDonald's food is, I honestly rather have that than a sandwich that was made yesterday and heated in a microwave. 

&gt;It is not cheap - any bistro had much better quality food for similar or even smaller price.

In Europe (especially Eastern Europe) this is true, but I found that in the US it is probably the cheapest way you can eat, except maybe for buying barely edible food from the dollar store. In other countries it may not be the case. In Romania for example, McDonald's was long considered quite an expensive place to eat, only in the last 10 years or so it has become more affordable, before that, you would probably take your kid to eat at McDonald's for his birthday.

&gt;Only reason to go to McDonalds was to enjoy a unique variety of trash food, as opposed to the local trash food.

Same in Romania. Fast food restaurant owners have absolutely zero imagination. 90% is just kebab and shawarma. The only fast food restaurants that do offer some variety are the international chains. If you live in a smaller city or town, you are pretty much fucked, besides the kebab places, you maybe have one or two decent pizza places if you're lucky.

Trump's major selling points are that he appeals to emotions and promotes 'alternative facts' that feel good but aren't based on reality.

3. Those numbers don't mean that each rape was committed by a different person.

So one person raping another person several times amounts to several cases, even though it's just one perpetrator and one victim.

The Schengen agreement is a good example: set up by countries who trust each-other enough to stop monitoring internal borders, but the UK never implemented it, inclusion of Romania/Bulgaria/Croatia is *still* being blocked, and the migrant crisis showed how quickly it breaks down without mutual trust.

I guess in this scenario where the EU has just become a cold political project, the EU will survive because it's still beneficial for most members and the net contributors can still manage the upkeep. But pre-2004 I was really hoping the EU could be a vehicle for much closer integration with our neighbouring countries (basically the original members), beyond just geopolitics and economy. Expanding the EU with so many members, and insisting on forcing all members in the same mold instead of a multi-speed set-up, was the final nail in that coffin and a big mistake IMO.

5381,"&gt; But the thing is, NATO was not the only option... It's part of the American sphere of influence and was the counterpart of the Warsaw pact during the Cold War. We should have attempted to END the divide between the East and the West when we had the chance after the Cold War... We could have formed our own European defensive pact... Yet, we did the complete opposite and just cemented American hegemony in Europe and elsewhere.
&gt;If you don't remember, US was getting along with Yeltsin just fine at first, but decided to pursue its own interests because it assumed Russia will NEVER ever be a serious contender for the West again and will gladly rebuild itself with American loans to the model the West wanted. But it didn't because they realized the game West was playing after NATO started expanding eastward and even bombed Yugoslavia, and under the good leadership of Putin, got back on their feet WITHOUT bowing to the West... 

Who is ""we"" in this scenario? Europe? Finland? From the perspective of a Latvian, my countries interests and Americas interests co-align. USA protects our tiny country from becoming a Russian puppet and the United States gets to weaken the standing of Russia in the world.

The United States had no obligation to spend insane amounts of money to prop up a country ruled by a corrupt oligarch elite. This is the real world, there is a middle ground between offering an olive branch and fixing someones mistakes.

As for NATO expanding eastwards, why shouldn't it? Countries east of Germany willingly joined NATO, why should the US value Russian interests over real democracies that want to be allied with them.

&gt;Nope. They are heavily aligned towards Russia and influenced by it, but they're not satellites.

That sounds like a definition of a satellite state, look what happened when Ukraine tried to leave Kremlin's orbit.

&gt;Well, if NATO wants to keep Europe out of another war...

US has been trying to get Europe to become independent for quite a while so they can focus on their interests in the South East Asia. It seems to me that Europe is on it's way to become more military independent and the US wants that.

Your whole narrative revolves around Russia being a superpower and the rest of the world having to give them space so they do not declare war on their neighbors.  EU's army and economy dwarfs Russia not accounting for nukes, which quite frankly cannot be used to negotiate anything other than an apocalypse.

Why should German, French and Eastern European interests be second to Russian interests? My country wants to be a part of the EU, the EU wants us to be a part of the EU. Russia does not get to have a say in this because they are not USSR, they simply are not powerful enough to dictate anyone besides their satellites.

5472,"&gt; Democracies provide worse candidates on average, but they are to rule only a fixed time,

You can go even a step further with democracy in the Athenian style - by sortition. For each issue to be voted, select a random group of people that will be responsible with taking that decision together, like a jury or a parliament. The same group will not keep power, but a different group will be selected next time. This can be scaled quickly to work in parallel on many issues. The group could be advised by experts in the field.

The advantage is that population is perfectly represented by the equalising power of randomness and we can cut money from politics. At most, the rich could try to use media to influence the population directly, a much more difficult process than donating to career politicians. There will be no need for elections and the whole circus they entail, because a new set of people are selected every time, and with enough people per batch, they can represent the country on average. I personally have more trust in the average person to be decent than politicians.

&gt; You do not seem to know what ""increase"" means or how it is measured: You can't just look at 1,7% of the total population being the victim of a crime in 2015 and then look at 2.4% the next and say it's an ""0.8% increase"". In reality the increase between those two years is 41% (more for women, especially young aged 16-24). It is mainly the statistics for women driving up the numbers of course.

Yeah you seem to be right I looked to quickly; this is pretty hard to compare in general.

This is the percentage of the population that suffered a crime crime, not the number of reported rapes that you cite here so this is hard to compare to begin with.

But since theres a double-taxation treaty they could reduce that rate by the amount of taxes they paid on the profits in Ireland. They paid 0.05% in Ireland, so they only had to pay 34.95% in the US. If they would have paid 35% or more profit taxes in Ireland, repatriation to the US would have been tax-free. 

Now there's a repatriation tax holiday and they only have to pay 15.5%. I'm not sure if these 15.5% are legally a tax, which they could then reduce by the 0.05%, or if it's a fee to be able to repatriate the money tax free.

5564,"&gt;Donald Trump is poised to snub Theresa May for the second time this month after it emerged he has no plans to meet her at next week’s World Economic Forum in Davos. The Prime Minister had been hoping for a “clear the air” meeting with Mr Trump at the Swiss resort after the US president unexpectedly cancelled plans for a visit to Britain.

&gt;Presidents and prime ministers do not usually attend the Davos summit, where chancellors and finance ministers take centre stage, but Whitehall sources had previously revealed plans to “engineer an encounter” between Mrs May and Mr Trump after they both announced they would be attending.

&gt;However, the White House has been lukewarm on the idea, saying Mr Trump has no time to meet Mrs May, even though he will meet Emmanuel Macron, the French president. Downing Street has now all but given up hope of a meeting taking place.

&gt;Rex Tillerson, the US secretary of state, added to the intrigue by claiming Mr Trump had cancelled his visit to Britain because Mrs May needed to “focus on Brexit”. Mr Trump had said he pulled out because of cost overruns on the new US Embassy in London, which he had been due to open.

&gt;A year on from Mrs May’s hand- holding moment with Mr Trump at the White House, the “special relationship” between the US and the UK has cooled, and British diplomats will be concerned that Mr Trump’s latest apparent snub signals that it has reached a new low, putting hopes of a post-Brexit trade deal with the US at risk.

&gt;Government sources blamed a “diary clash” for the meeting not taking place, initially claiming Mr Trump would not arrive in Davos until Friday, while Mrs May is there on Wednesday and Thursday. But an official communique from the White House disclosed that Mr Trump will arrive on Thursday morning, which suggests diary dates are not the real issue.

&gt;A White House source told The Daily Telegraph that there was not time in Mr Trump’s schedule to meet the Prime Minister, despite him being in Davos for two days.

 
&gt;“It is an extremely quick trip,” said one Trump source, adding that the president would only be spending “a very short amount of time” at the event.

&gt;The source said there was “desire” from both the US and the British end to see the two leaders meet, but that the lack of time was getting in the way. However, the US media has reported that Mr Trump – who announced his attendance last week – has already arranged a meeting with Mr Macron, one of the speakers at the event.",,/r/europe/comments/7rictv/donald_trump_to_snub_theresa_may_for_second_time/dsx2mqm/,mystery144,1516369390

They are overestimating the importance of British trade to the rest of the UK, and we have free flow of goods in the EU, we are not yet as liberalised in services, so their strongest leg is one in which we're least interested in.

Which is what the exemption to the existing EU ban is about. It also means you should refrain from claiming conclusive scientific evidence either way, if you yourself admit that there's not enough of it.

&gt;Banning it won't change that.

Again, pulse fishing has been banned since 2007. The European Parliament did not ban it this week. That is not what that vote was about.

&gt;What arguments have the French brought to the table

Various Dutch studies on the negative environmental effects and the claim that it depletes their fish stocks by killing particularly high numbers of young fish. That should be assessed, but considering the Dutch trawlers are mainly fishing in French and British waters, they should get a say in the matter, don't you think?

&gt;Broken backs on fishes already getting caught, is just appealing to emotion

It actually appeals to the fact that we have laws about animal cruelty and what's acceptable when killing animals for food.

Bloom actually consists of environmental NGOs as well.

&gt;It's proven to be more eco-friendly

According to you, not enough evidence has been collected, so it's not proven to be anything. 

&gt;just not totally eco-friendly

Understatement of the century, considering we're talking about trawlers.

&gt;Well surprise, so is beam fishing

No argument there. Trawlers are bad for the environment.

5796,"&gt;That's what having nukes is all about.

You seem deeply unaware of why countries (used) and would use atomic bombs. My grasp on large scale conflicts is based purely on playing strategical games, although i'm quite sure, that nukes are used to eliminate strategically important objects of the enemy, such as ports, airbases, warehouses, industrial objects and so on. The only time someone used nukes(USA), i quote wikipedia:

&gt;The Target Committee nominated five targets: Kokura, the site of one of Japan's largest munitions plants; Hiroshima, an embarkation port and industrial center that was the site of a major military headquarters; Yokohama, an urban center for aircraft manufacture, machine tools, docks, electrical equipment and oil refineries; Niigata, a port with industrial facilities including steel and aluminum plants and an oil refinery; and Kyoto, a major industrial center.

They way you said it, is that countries would use atomic bombs to eliminate all the population. *NO* *ONE* in their mind would do that, i refuse to believe that is the case. 
&gt;war against the Baltics will lead to the death of every single Russian

Even in case of MAD happening, no person would use nukes to exclusively eliminate civil population, that is just straight up insane. 
So, it's either you really don't have any idea on what war is, or your sick hatred for russians knows no limits.

2. Elites of other countries control media/entertainment industry (either directly or through controlled elites of 'target' country) and nobody who doesn't have support of at least part of that foreign elites can get elected. 

3. if none of above is true, which is very, very rare, you can get third kind of democracy, in which 2 idiots can outvote a Genius, but for this kind of democracy to go on for a long time a country should be totally irrelevant, irrelevant enough not to be worth any trouble.

5857,"And like most rabid Brexiters, you've entirely missed the point. The Tories have been happy to see the redtop press hammer the EU relentlessly, falsely blaming them for everything from the wrong coloured fish to straight condoms.

The reality has been Tory austerity. It is the reason local services are crap through deliberate defunding, that genuinely disabled people, some in wheelchairs with full time helpers, are being declared fit for work and their benefits abruptly ceased with no appeal recourse, to the NHS being deliberately and systematically dismantled, with the tories and their families and friends queuing up to get some of that PFI taxpayers cash for the all new, predominately Tory owned, private health system, with its easily recognisable slogan.. ""If you can't afford healthcare.....die"".

The EU hasn't been to blame for any of the financial hardship, and all the noise about sovereignty is complete crap, a large pile of Tory and redtop press disingenuous crap. You brexiters have fallen for the biggest scam in UK political history, and millions are going to suffer now and in the future because you're too xenophobic, racist, and frankly stupid, to see beyond your narrowminded little englander limitations and dreams. 

Even now you're being treated with derision and contempt by westminster because of your lack of vision and relentless reluctance to see a 21st century future, instead of the same old fucking Empire nostalgia.
What will it take for you to activate more than 2 brain cells at a time. You're being fucked over by the Tories, not the EU. They're using your xenophobia and mythical empire nostalgia against you. 

It's right there in front of you as plain as day, but you stick your heads in the sand, your arses in the air, and hum Rule Britannia, somehow expecting things will just turn out ok, as if some fairies draped in the St. Georges flag will wave their magic unicorn dicks in the air, and England will be great again, a land of milk and cooking sherry, and white faces who speak as close to estuary english as its possible to get, without any of that unpleasant foreign stuff hurting your ears.

Which part of this equation do you not understand? The local services are decreasing rapidly, the predominately Tory led councils in most of england are getting ever larger pension pots, and squirreling cash away. Now you pay more and can't get a police officer to attend a burglary, or get your bins emptied more than once a month. It's not the EU doing this to you. It's Tory Westminster, directing their troops in the local councils!

And you've fucked that up by continuing to vote for those arrogant political vermin who don't want the other 3 home nations to do anything but fall to their kees and pay homage on the alter of the predominately english Westminster establishment. Scotland could be shafted again by their arrogance, and you think that's ok, because it's the way it's always been, and i suspect, it's the way you think it should be, with a majority english parliament ruling over all others.

5905,"&gt; No mainstream Christian religion takes the bible literally. So why should it be banned only because some lunatics interpret it as such?

Benedict XVI has flat out said he believes in the literal truth of the bible.

This is bullshit and you know it; Abrahamic religious leaders left and right claim that the historical accounts in the Old -, New -, and Final Testament are historical accounts of what actually happened, not ""metaphors"" for anything—that the story of Moses is a metaphor is a ridiculous interpretation that you just made up.. Exodus claims it simply put _happened_ and so do religious leaders and followers alike. They will claim that Jesus actually healed the lame and walked on water and turned it into whine; that Muhammad was visited by Gabriel in a cave to reveal the word of God onto him.

&gt; With that argument you could ban pretty much everything, you just need to find someone to interpret it literally. Wanna ban sarcasm as well?

No, you prosecute those that interpret it literally and preach it and in this case the book itself which does not and never intented to say it's a metaphor for anything? Have you ever _read_ a Bible?
