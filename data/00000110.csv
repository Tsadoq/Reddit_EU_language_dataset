1,"The only reason Zazas fought along with Kurds against Turks is because they were oppressed the very same way Kurds were. They had the same religion, same motives and there wasn’t any ethnic-related ideology or the suppression that they were either Kurds or Zazas or Turks, that we have today so they didn’t feel need to differentiate themselves from Kurds. There were Arab and Turkish groups as well who rebelled against Turkish state in eastern Turkey. 

I’ve been to so many villages in eastern Turkey, almost all Zazas have come to a state in which they started to hate Kurdish people because they want to assimilate them. People think ‘Kurds are trying to assimilate us the way Turks were trying to assimilate Kurds’ . Some Zaza people who want Zaza language to be officially recognized share the same opinion with Kurdish nationalists so they think they should be unified to have more power. However, the number of people who think that way aren’t greater than %of Zazas at most. 

The ethnic groups are divided by their languages and what people of those ethnic groups are willing to be identified as. Zazas and Kurds may have a similar culture since Zazas were the less-populated bubble, surrounded by Kurds. Especially throughout the ages in which the people were mostly divided by their religions. Eastern Turks share so many cultural aspects with Zazas and Kurds as well. Even Armenians, despite having a different religion. Genetic studies show that Zazas and Kurds are similar but  NOT THE SAME. The group called ‘Turkish DNA’ on Facebook is your friend. Don’t get misled by its name, they are trustworthy. Zazas are most similar to Kurds and Talysh Azerbaijanis but they are DIFFERENT. 

Checking your post history, I’m seeing that you are in fact half Kurdish and half Zaza, seems like you might have an identity crisis. Some Half Turkish half Zaza people I came across stated to
me that Zazas were actually Turks. Same with Zazas who have Kurdish ancestors. Identity crisis is a thing and people across the globe have it.",,/r/europe/comments/f7pfr8/star_in_european_languages/fidtr4d/,amidrunkoramiokay,1582371279
2,"&gt;Also it kind of depends on how the question is phrased (then vs. now) but everyone knows that Al-Qaeda was indeed kickstarted by the CIA to get the soviets out of Afghanistan.

Not really, the US funding the Afghan resistance. Al-Qaeda didn't need funding since Bin Laden was rich as fuck. Al-Qaeda was more an Arab group made up of people who went over to fight in what they saw as a holy war but they didn't really do much fighting and wasn't really that much to do with the Afghan mujahideen who did most of the fighting and after the soviets left spilt into many different warring factions.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/f7pxaw/8_in_10_french_people_believe_a_conspiracy_theory/fidtr7m/,zxcv1992,1582371280
3,"""alternative to adress the birthrate issue.""
but the result is the same in the end and some people just are against replacement or would like to see politicians adressing the birth rate issue on a national level, like in Hungary. But if you say, natives need to have more children, you are considered rightwing too.
You should also not ignore that media and politicians often don't want to focus on native birth rates. They even encourage not to have children to fight climate change. https://i.imgur.com/oP4Qhtj.jpg

&gt; *Now, there’s always a chance that even a highly relevant authority could be wrong, so it’s always a good idea to think of facts as provisionally true.*

&gt; *Accept information from credible experts as correct, but be willing to change your mind whenever you come across an argument with more trustworthy facts*

&gt; https://patrikedblad.com/logical-fallacies/the-appeal-to-authority-fallacy/

Yes, that's always the very first thought:

&gt; *encrypted message systems are bad as they can be used by terrorists and pedophiles*


Encryption is not the problem

&gt; ***Banning encryption to stop terrorists: a worse than futile exercise***

&gt; *Terrorist groups are increasingly using encryption to plan and coordinate terrorist acts, leading to calls for the banning or backdooring of encrypted messaging apps. This would be misguided. It would not remove the ability of terrorist groups to access this technology and may push them to communicate in ways that are more difficult for Western intelligence agencies to monitor. By creating vulnerabilities in online tools used by a very large number of Americans and other users around the world, it would also expose the broader society to increased security risks.*

&gt; https://ctc.usma.edu/banning-encryption-to-stop-terrorists-a-worse-than-futile-exercise/

and

&gt; ***Why banning secure email won’t stop terror***

&gt; *What we do know for sure is that banning encryption would certainly lead to an increase in cyberattacks, data breaches, and an end to online banking and online shopping. This is not to mention the numerous dissidents, journalists, and activists whose lives will be put at risk*

&gt; https://protonmail.com/blog/privacy-encryption-and-terrorism/

Banning or not using encryption is putting many other people at risk: journalists, whistleblowers, political dissidents, activists, non-hetero people, ...

&gt; *For some people, private, anonymous messaging apps can be absolutely crucial. Journalists use these apps to safeguard their sources — and themselves. Whistleblowers need them to get the word out without compromising their identity. Politicians use them to keep the country’s secrets safe. And activists rely on them to further their cause without compromising their safety or security.*

&gt;people would have identified him as German not as Polish because he was simply part of the German speaking population

By this, what you are really saying is, that **you,** ignoring all context, decide his language makes him German. 

Because 

[Melanchthon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanchthon) wrote: 

&gt;Some people believe that it is excellent and correct to work out a thing as absurd as did that [Sarmatian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarmatism) \[i.e., Polish\] astronomer who moves the earth and stops the sun. Indeed, wise rulers should have curbed such light-mindedness.[\[45\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Copernicus#cite_note-Polish_Literature_p._38-63) 

Proves otherwise. 

If you judge nationality by language you would incorrectly call Americans English because they spoke English, this ignores the context that although America was a British colony, it broke off and formed its own nationality. 

the reality is that Latin was the language of religion and intellectualism in Europe, and was the language of trade near the Baltic, and even as far as Ukraine. While Polish, was a common tongue and did not become a popular written language until after the printing press. So why would you expect Polish writhing from him?  Nothing about this was unusual for a Pole in this time. Even Jan Dlugosz (1415), Poland's first historian wrote mostly Latin. 

And either you didn't know Poland used to be a multiethnic country like the US, or just ignored this. 

When any people immigrate to a new country they form a community within that country. Some learn that countries language as a secondary language while they sent their children off to that countries school where they learn it as their first language, but back then there was no mandatory national education system there was little pressure to create more linguistic homogeneity, except for merchants who had to learn multiple languages or anyone who lived around Poles, which there were in Torun. So if you want to be specific he was actually part of the community of bilingual Polish loyalists. 

&gt;No Polish texts by Copernicus survive due to the rarity of Polish literary language before the writings of the [Polish Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_Renaissance) poets [Mikołaj Rej](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miko%C5%82aj_Rej) and [Jan Kochanowski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Kochanowski) (educated Poles had generally written in Latin); but it is known that Copernicus knew Polish on a par with German and Latin.[\[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Copernicus#cite_note-189)

But even today with a national education you still have similar language diversity. In school in addition to your countries language you learn English as an international language like Latin once was, as well as any other languages relevant to your area, which is why you still have Sorbs in Germany. Even Hitler, being the racist nationalist he was, called the Slavic speaking Germans, are you going to tell me they are not German? 

And you are right that there was no single German nationality since Germany did not exist but there were ""German"" nationalities like, Bavarian, Swiss, Austrian, Thuringian, etc.. 

The word German in the middle ages, actually meant Germanic speakers of the HRE, which included the Dutch, hence the relation between Dutch and Deutcsh. 

So when he joined in Bologna, if by German you mean ""community of German speakers"" sure, it was a prestigious group which only required you to be fluent in German and he did speak German so why wouldn't he Join?

The old meaning of German is more similar to the modern meaning of ""Germanic"", but most people here aren't using the old meaning of the word.  

It literally says this in the wiki, did you even bother to read it? 

&gt;signed himself into the register of the Bologna University of Jurists' ""German nation"", which included young Poles from [Silesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silesia), [Prussia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prussia) and [Pomerania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomerania) as well as students of other nationalities.[\[22\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Copernicus#cite_note-psb5-30) 

and

&gt; However, according to French philosopher [Alexandre Koyré](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandre_Koyr%C3%A9), Copernicus's registration with the *Natio Germanorum* does not in itself imply that Copernicus considered himself German, since students from Prussia and Silesia were routinely so categorized, which carried certain privileges that made it a natural choice for German-speaking students, regardless of their ethnicity or self-identification.

Regardless, Copernicus formed his ideas when he was in Krakow lectured by other Polish astronomers like Albert Brudzewski, so he was definitely a ""Polish Astronomer"" 

Admit it, this is only controversial because he was a intellectual, any other white man, born in Poland, of mixed ethnicity, related to the nobility,  to a family of Polish loyalists, and new the Polish language, and had done so much for the country, nobody, would argue he wasn't Polish.

322,"While it's pretty much standard (and sensible) to field at least two carriers for rotation, there is little point for a medium-sized country like France, whose vital interests are not even remotely threatened in this day and age, 30 years after the end of the Cold War, to have several of them. Those vessels are primarily meant to be used in conventional warfare, and in this regard, France is experiencing one of the most low-intensity eras of its entire history. It logically doesn't warrant over-investing in that kind of equipment.

Ligther, multipurpose intervention carriers such as the [Mistral-class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mistral-class_amphibious_assault_ship) are more adapted to the kind of asymmetric warfare France has been, is, and will remain involved in, in the foreseeable future.

Incidentally, France has [4 active SSBNs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triomphant-class_submarine), a single unit of those costing more than a carrier like the *Charles de Gaulle*. So it's hardly a matter of not being able to pay for more, or incompetent decision-making. It's a matter of properly identifying your actual needs, and balancing them out.

But hey, dick waving and pissing contests are cool too. I guess.

&amp;nbsp;

Additionally, with the increasingly considered prospect of a more integrated European defense, it may very well become redundant, in the long-term, for a single EU member to field (and/or pay for) more than one of those vessels during peace-time.

Not to mention that France is also part of NATO, whose point is precisely to pool up military resources in case of military conflicts -- the crushing majority of which, in the 21st century, being peacekeeping operations.

I'm not sure if you're just dodging this question, but for the benefit of doubt, I'm assuming based on your choice of words you consider the point of conception? As in, you are not opposed to contraception, but against abortion at *any* stage of pregnancy?

It's probably just something most people will have to agree to disagree on, as everyone who enters a discussion like this - including me - has already developed strong opinions on the subject. Nevertheless, I think it's good that we can at least debate it regardless of the outcome. But yeah, I just cannot consider a single cell, or even a bundle of cells, a ""person"".

What makes a human being a human being should be judged on what it is *at the moment* of observation, not on what it [may(!)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscarriage) eventually become. Because barring women from abortion means that an *existing*, living, feeling person's right to happiness is impacted for the sake of a possible future of what is, at the point of observation, but an unfeeling piece of biomatter.

And that future may not even be a bright one. An unwanted birth puts the child at risk of unhappiness, too, from abandonment to abuse to just growing up in a household not equipped to deal with the situation, be it mentally or financially.

I hope this goes to show that I do not draw my line with complete disregard for the sake of an unborn child, but rather that I refuse to subscribe to the idea that even a fertilized egg should immediately count as a human being.",European Union,/r/europe/comments/f77934/grand_opening_of_the_rzeszóws_university_hospital/fic323h/,akashisenpai,1582336394

Long answer, the road network that allowed for the movement of heavy machinery (tanks, artillery, supply trucks) in Normandy was extremely limited during the war, so there were only so many roads the Allied forces could use to move men and materiel from the beaches in Normandy to the French hinterland. Most of those roads passed through certain towns (Carentan, St. Lô, Caen, and Bayeux being the key four). The Germans obviously knew that, and so they fortified key cities and dug in to repel the Allied attacks. Bombing and artillery strikes is the best way to displace a dug-in force in close quarters in preparation for an attack.

My prediction for the UK at least is there will be a point fairly soon where the government isn't going to be able to maintain the numerous subsidies given to electric cars - they're going to decide the batteries are too polluting and hammer them with a much heavier road tax (rather than current zero), or that domestic electricity tax rates need to increase above 5% (which will hurt everyone)

The one thing I can promise you is that no government is going to give up a sizeable chunk of revenue - especially one that the vast majority don't even consider a 'tax' in the way they do income or property taxes.",,/r/europe/comments/f7aomw/europes_leaders_in_environmental_taxation/fib46po/,GaybarStabbing,1582314262

1006,"&gt; for IQ to be innate, not trainable or environment-influenced, and transmissible from parents to children

Go read the contemporary literature with robust psychometric and genomic investigation on IQ.

It's largely inherited, with mild external influences (of the sort that are really more like nutritional and substance mediation of effective cognitive ability)


&gt;for the government to be perfectly able to verify high IQ from a very early age

No, stuff like the German education system clearly already works very well. Pretending people are all equally able is what America does by extending college loans to all comers (creating the market for the loans in the first place by telling everyone to go to higher education)


&gt;for the employers of high IQ mothers to accept that they won’t be able to count on those high IQ women for the duration of their maternity leave

Indeed, Capitalism shreds the genes of the high IQ by putting men, but especially women, through an anti-fertility rat race that mostly benefits shareholders.


&gt;for said high IQ mothers (whose income is related to the IQ they have) to accept having more children in spite of the multiply observed fact that higher education leads to fewer births per woman

1023,"&gt; I am not a jurist but it mentions schools without religious denomination being exempt from this. You could build a workaround by defining schools as secular and therefore making the whole paragraph useless without necessarily having to change the constitution.

One *could* do that, but for that to happen there needs to be a will for it happen, and that will simply does not exist in Germany.

Thus the government acts as the tax-collector for the big Christian denominations, while they get representation in all kinds of government branches from state media to the rating boards that rate media from music to video games.

&gt; Also I have my doubts that this paragraph is up-to-date anyways. 

Neither is the blasphemy paragraph, that doesn't stop German courts from [still applying it](https://www.welt.de/vermischtes/article152656037/Ex-Lehrer-wegen-Gotteslaesterung-verurteilt.html) because that's how German courts are: If it's a law on the books, it's totally legitimate.

And times being as they are, German courts are getting clogged up with all kinds of people who feel their religion was in some way insulted, which isn't a trait exclusive to Muslims, but these make, of course, also plenty of use of said law.

&gt; That would also lead to more and more religions requiring appropriate lessons and it is just not possible to teach 5 or whatever religions separately, you just waste a lot of manpower for not really a lot.

I'd be really surprised if schools teaching 5 religions are something that can be found all that often outside certain urban centers. 2 are a given pretty much everywhere, both Christian ones, particularly in southern rural areas, there sometimes isn't even enough demand for ethics lessons, thus Christian lessons are all there is.

1051,"&gt; Anyway, it is interesting. I dont think its that crazy that Italian bonds have low yields. They have incredible amount of savers in that country and I guess investors trust ECB and other Eurozone countries to bail out Italy.

Its more that investors are absolutely starved of yield. If you need to hold european sovereign debt (as part of geographical allocation), then a lot of it yields nothing or actually charges you money to hold. It is out of desperation. 

There literally isn't enough money in the ESM to bail out Italy. Good luck getting the rest of the eurozone to bail them out, look at what a shitshow Greece was and they are a fraction of the size of Italy. 

&gt; Also how is ECB not lender of last resort?

The ECB isn't the lender of last resort, the central banks of the member states are. But they are only allowed to act as lenders of last resort in a capacity which the ECB governing council approves of. The ECB can *override* the lending facilities of the national banks if they feel that it is *inappropriate).

See the Greek Crisis, banks turned to the Bank of Greece to act as lender of last resort, BoG had to ask ECB permission, ECB granted permission but with many strings attached. They then took the extraordinary decision to turn off liquidity support for the Greek banking system which caused the banks to shut and the system to freeze up. It dramatically worsened the financial situation in the country. 

That is not what a lender of last resort is supposed to do. The ECB can be *very* political.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/f726my/g7_countries_gdp_growth_since_1990/fiafn7a/,MyFavouriteAxe,1582300050

1093,"&gt; UK manufacturing grew at its fastest rate in 10 months in February, according to a flash Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) reading, but services fell to a two-month low.

&gt; According to IHS Markit / CIPS data, manufacturing hit 52.8, up from January’s final rate of 50.1, whilst services fell to 53.3, down from 53.9 last month.

&gt; The composite output rate was 53.3, unchanged from the end of January. Any figure under 50 indicates a contraction, while any over 50 represents growth.

&gt; The pound rose 0.3 per cent against the dollar to $1.2920 after the PMI data.

&gt; Tim Moore, associate director at IHS Markit, said: “The recent return to growth signalled by the manufacturing and services PMIs provides a clear indication that the UK economy is no longer flat on its back, with our GDP now pointing to 0.2 per cent growth through the first quarter of the year.”

&gt; Despite the positive reading, the survey showed manufacturers were seeing early signs of disruption to export sales and business operations due to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak.

&gt; Moore added: “While there are positive signals for UK businesses on the domestic front, the latest PMI findings highlight a number of concerns from an international perspective following the Covid-19 outbreak. Service providers often commented on reduced tourism-related bookings and cancellations from overseas clients in affected markets.

&gt; “Manufacturers noted that abrupt shortages of components from China had reverberated through their supply chains and led to difficulties sourcing critical inputs.

&gt; “The downward trajectory of the suppliers’ delivery times index since January was the steepest since the survey began, exceeding the previous record set amid the UK fuel protests in September 2000”.

&gt; Duncan Brock, group director at CIPS, said that despite the threat posed by the illness, “optimism remains high, especially among service providers”:

&gt; “Though there was some relief in business costs as inflationary pressures were muted in February, service providers were still confident enough to raise prices for customers, possibly making up for lost time over Brexit uncertainty and reduced consumer spending.

&gt; “With these new challenges unfurling at the beginning of the year, 2020 is unlikely to be a quiet year for the UK economy”.

&gt; “The unchanged level of the composite PMI in February is a strong result, given the disruption to the global economy from the Covid-19 outbreak and bad weather in the UK,” Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said.

&gt; Storm Ciara and Storm Dennis hurt services

&gt; He added that Storm Ciara and Storm Dennis have taken a toll on UK services, however.

&gt; “The dip in the services PMI likely reflects the hit to demand in the restaurants, hotels and leisure sector from February’s exceptionally high level of rainfall, which has been three times its long-run average.”

&gt; The insurance industry could face a £425m bill from the storm damage, as a result of flooding and high winds.

&gt; Andrew Wishart, a UK economist at Capital Economics, added that the strong data combined with the government’s change of chancellor could prove advantageous for the economy.

&gt; “The continued strength of the PMI confirms improved sentiment has helped the economy turn a corner at the start of this year,” he said. “And a new chancellor who is more of a fiscal dove than his predecessor should mean fiscal policy reinforces the recovery in economic momentum.

&gt; “That’s why, despite the external headwinds of weak growth in the euro-zone and coronavirus, we think GDP growth will rise from one per cent this year to 1.8 per cent next, eradicating any reason for the Bank of England to cut rates.”",,/r/europe/comments/f7b53r/uk_pmi_manufacturing_grows_at_fastest_rate_in_10/fia3n7g/,bataneyelid,1582292113

1105,"&gt;Why Germans won’t heat **their homes** even with free electricity?     
&gt;&gt;For the first time, the **market price** of electricity fell below zero in Finland.       

The 'market price' is on the wholesale market, without any monies for infrastructure and maintenance and stuff, what customers are paying for 'home' use is the 'retail' market, incl. transmission/distribution wiring and all that.      

The 'wholesale' price is volatile, the 'retail' is a (1/2)year pre-published fixed price (ct/kWh), the retail company 'balances' that volatility (you win some, you lose some).     

Larger customers can 'buy' on the wholesale market, for them this 'negative price' is a good incentive to modify (in whatever form) their production process to make maximum use of it, at the moment mostly in the form of thermal storage (both as 'heat' in an extra boiler, or as 'cold' with an additional chiller for a frozen food warehouse, whatever), but variable speed(power) in conveyor belt type production processes is also possible.      
 
This flexible 'demand response' from customers helps to bring the average (retail) price down, during excess wind/solar the competition in 'the race to the bottom' will increase the minimum price (example: from -10€/MWh to +15€/MWh), during sudden shortages that would otherwise need €1000+/MWh 'peaker' generators those same customers can reduce/minimize their demand as they already have some 'energy product' in storage, reducing those peak-prices to &lt;500€/MWh(example).    

In the grand scheme of things this benefits the 'free fuel' generators (wind/solar/water), the 'boiler' generators still need to to keep the boiler/turbine 'hot' even when there is no demand, and those are the real cause of 'negative' prices as that is cheaper for a few hours than having to completely shut down and (24 hours) restart from a 'cold' boiler.",Flevoland,/r/europe/comments/f77lry/why_germans_wont_heat_their_homes_even_with_free/fia3qeo/,mrCloggy,1582292182

1110,"I don't really know much about other countries but here in Germany you definitely have them. However you are not forced to take them but can also instead visit ethics (usually the name for the replacement) instead.

The whole Christian Church is really institutionalized in Germany which has some advantages but also some downsides.

One thing is that the government collects a tax for those that are registered as religious and then gives most of that collected money to the respective institutions (they keep a small fee for the additional work).

Also Christian priests are civil servants here and paid for by the state (not by the tax they collected or the religious institutions!) I don't have a number for the last year at hand but in 2010 the German state paid ~450 million Euros(!!) for all those priests and whatnot.

The advantage of that is that they are less likely to talk batshit insane stuff since they need to have studied theology and are more closely bound to the constitution.

The disadvantage of that is pretty obvious, the 450 million per year (probably more by now) are gone instead of investing them in any sort of infrastructure or education.",,/r/europe/comments/f77934/grand_opening_of_the_rzeszóws_university_hospital/fia3t03/,GDevl,1582292237

1154,"&gt; **Agreement on a final budget deal at summit is unlikely, says Mette Frederiksen, Danish PM**

&gt; A summit to fix the EU’s long-term budget looked in danger of ending in failure after less than a day of talks, with leaders miles apart on how to fill the €75bn (£63bn) hole left by Brexit.

&gt; As sources predicted a potential early close in Brussels, the European council president, Charles Michel, came under criticism for aiming “far too high” with a proposed budget of 1.074% of the bloc’s gross national income (€1.094tn).

&gt; One EU diplomat said on Friday morning: “He wanted enough cash to buy a Range Rover; we only have the money for a Volkswagen – and worst of all he asked Mutti [the German chancellor, Angela Merkel] to pay for the Range Rover.”

&gt; EU officials insisted that the negotiations would continue, as leaders prepared to meet again at midday central European time. But the Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, told reporters as she arrived that it appeared unlikely that EU leaders would reach a final budget deal at the summit.

&gt; “I’m prepared to stay the whole weekend, but no, I don’t think we are going to reach an agreement,” she said, adding that leaders would probably require another meeting in March.

&gt; The 27 heads of state and government had been expected to talk at least into Saturday, and possibly through the weekend, on the multi-financial framework, setting funding from 2021 to 2027 for the EU’s programmes from agriculture to space, defence and regional development.

&gt; Sources said that such was the deadlock that it would be likely to end on Friday afternoon unless Michel delivered a significantly revised proposal.

&gt; The self-styled “frugals” – the Netherlands, Austria, Sweden and Denmark – are insisting on a budget of no more than 1% of the EU’s gross national income, and retention of their rebates.

&gt; On the first evening of the summit on Thursday, Merkel had joined the group of leaders by insisting Germany would also retain its full rebate for the seven-year period.

&gt; Arriving at the summit on Friday morning, Andrej Babiš said that unless those leaders changed their minds, “we can go straight home”. The Czech prime minister said: “They propose that all states pay €75bn less into the budget than is proposed.”

&gt; Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, has led the charge of the frugal states against the more expansive demands of the so-called “friends of cohesion” group, who are the largest recipients of funds for the development of the EU’s poorest countries.

&gt; The Netherlands claims Michel’s proposal would increase its contributions by 20%.

After the 90's when the CD died, LPF rose, same message, multiculturalism and muslims.

&gt;Why are you so afraid of death? Why not accept that everyone will die eventually? Why force them to die from disintegration, instead of at a place and time of their choosing?

It is not a question of fear. It is the question of a utilitarian life. If it is truly a wish, a choice made without external factors, pressure or and atmosphere of urgency, then it is the right choice. But if it is made because of bad care, insufficient understanding and a feeling of burden, then euthanasia is not the debate we should be having, but instead we should be working to improve on those factors.


&gt;Doesn't mean it should be illegal, in fact, the procedure should be legally described so the option not abused or forced on people... but neither should people who want it be denied.

I am afraid of putting it on the table. How does a physician inform a patient of that choice without it being some kind of pressure to do so. It should not be illegal but for anything else, I am still unsure.


&gt;This is what happened in Belgium before euthanasia was legal: usually the doctor would increase palliative care medication to the point that was effectively lethal. That's just hypocritical. It also happened without a proper, open discussion, but with implied meanings. That's no way to make a major life decision.

That is a breach of declarations of medical ethics, not just hypocritical. I would like an open discussion in my country but jumpstarting it with discussing euthanasia misses what we lack in care.

1274,"Catholic church was was instumental for survival of Polish nation. There were times and places in history where one could engage in Polish culture only in a church. And catholic one was the only one with structures and outside influence to be able to not budge under occupying countries influence. Tho the Polish Orthodox church never defected to Russian one, it was just too small to oppose in a meanigfull matter russification, but some parts of it survived to this day. It's the protestant one that was hitted the most and basically stopped existed by germanization for the time.

Also seeing how people in the west describe catholoc church I guess our branch just acted differently from the western ones. It never opposed science in our nation (it was the biggest supporter of Copernicus's work), it didn't heavily go against our policies and it was quite helpful in defending against German agression for a long time. We also practically haven't had any burnings for heresy or stuff similar for that (we once killed off a sect of heretics, but not for heresy, but for planning assasination of our king). Heretical movements were and still are quite accepted in Poland. There is a part of Kashubian christians that tell their own seperate tell of world creation, where devil fishes for land on God's command. We all burned Marzanna in our lifetimes.

&gt;. They are an illegitimate paramilitary group who target civilians, including men women and children, with violence such as bombings. Their primary goal is the reclaiming the whole island of Ireland under the same state as the Republic of Ireland.

This should all be in the past tense. The evidence does not support the idea that they \*targeted\* civilians as part of their strategy. More than half of those killed by the PIRA were soldiers or members of the security forces. A significant portion of those civilians killed were the result of premature explosions or warnings going wrong. Reckless? Yes but not the same as actively targeting civilians. The ratio of civilians to combatants killed by the British Army is actually worse than the IRA. Loyalist paramilitaries on the other hand are a clear example of what targeting civilians looks like with 80% of their killings being of civilians compared to the IRA's 30%.

The Provisional IRA does not exist as a functioning paramilitary anymore which is also the Chief Constable of Northern Ireland's assessment. This does not mean SF has no links to the group. Everyone in Ireland knows this. That SF member had just invoked the IRA/INLA hunger strikers in his speech, one of whom had run for election in that constituency while on strike in 1981, before shouting three common republican slogans. It caused a media storm about optics but absolutely no one in Ireland was surprised that a SF member would do that in the manner he did.",Belfast,/r/europe/comments/f6uedw/ireland_leftwing_sinn_féin_would_surge_to_a_17/fi9qxmw/,tigernmas,1582277904

You can take a look at some PEW opinion polls and realize that muslims do want to live in a muslim state, and more particularly in sharia law which is by definition a theocracy. It's not that I support theocracies but they do. 

You also have diverging views on other issues such as homosexuality:  [https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/11/british-muslims-strong-sense-of-belonging-poll-homosexuality-sharia-law](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/11/british-muslims-strong-sense-of-belonging-poll-homosexuality-sharia-law)

Remember that these people are sometimes 3rd generation muslims in Britain, so there was enough time for integration.

I suppose things are better a bit with Turks in Germany just because Turkey has more modern culture than Middle Eastern countries. 

You jump to conclusions too quick. I don't want all muslims expelled. I want to stop muslim immigration to Europe and cut the losses with the ones that are already here, meaning as much integration as possible.

What's wrong with an ethnostate anyway? Social stability? More trust between people? Less crime? I am in favor of an ethonstate for all cultures. Ok to have an Arab ethnostate, ok to have a Japanese ethnostate, ok to have a German ethnostate.

1582,"&gt;ONE of Scotland’s staunchest Brexiteers has blasted Boris Johnson’s post-Brexit immigration plans, warning they will be “catastrophic” for fishing industry.  
&gt;  
&gt;Speaking on Radio 4’s Today programme, Jimmy Buchan, the CEO of the Scottish Seafood Association, warned that any “sea of opportunity” coming from Brexit would be lost if processing firms were forbidden from hiring workers from overseas.  
&gt;  
&gt;Buchan, a former Tory candidate, who joined Nigel Farage in a flotilla on the Thames ahead of the 2016 referendum, said the North East of Scotland was 70% dependent on migrant workers.  
&gt;  
&gt;Asked if the industry would be able to attract local people into these jobs, he replied: “This is a story where we've become a victim of our own success. We've raised the bar of how we want our own people to live their lives. We've created education routes. We've encouraged people to seek different careers. We're in a very low employment area with oil and gas and light industry.  
&gt;  
&gt;""So getting local people to do the task of the fish filleting and the skills that are needed here we've just found it very very challenging and that void has been filled by the freedom of movement of people across Europe who've been willing to come here and fill these posts. ""  
&gt;  
&gt;The government's new migration proposals – revealed earlier this week – would see a ""points-based"" immigration system, brought in with overseas citizens needing to reach 70 points to be able to work in the UK.  
&gt;  
&gt;There will be restrictions on those who are classed as unskilled, which could devastate sectors including tourism, care, farming and fishing.  
&gt;  
&gt;Asked about automation as a solution to any recruitment crisis, Buchan replied: ""I'll tell you something there's no one can beat the skill of a human with a knife whether it's filleting fish or whether it's a shucking knife and shucking scallops or cutting monktails. These are all tasks that to date can't be done by a machine. ""  
&gt;  
&gt;He added: ""If we cannot get the people into the factories then any sea of opportunity that Brexit can provide is going to be economically lost. I think the fish will still be caught, the fish will still be bought and sold but the economic benefit to Scotland is going to be catastrophic because we will not be able to compete in a global market if we cannot get the workers in the factories.""  
&gt;  
&gt;Following the referendum result Buchan, a veteran skipper who became an unlikely celebrity thanks to the hit BBC documentary Trawlermen, said it was the realisation of a long-held dream. ""When I saw the results come in I felt jubilation and a huge sense of relief,"" he said. ""We fishermen have been campaigning to get out of Europe for decades.""

1807,"I'm not sure what you mean by nations didn't exist yet, but Poland certainly did exist, and as a consequence, the Polish nationality. There wasn't much of a push to redraw countries along ethno-linguistic lines until the 19th century, yes, but there was multiculturalism before that and there still is today, you have countries like USA where ethnicities from all corners of the world are American by nationality so whats the problem?

But a white man, with some ancestral ties to Poland, is born in Poland, knows the language, and proves his loyalty to Poland throughout his life, acknowledging he was Polish is controversial ?

Its only because he was a successful astronomer did German nationalists of the 19th century try to claim him, if he was some random farmer or stupid they would never deny he was Polish and you know it.

&gt;but honestly, someone else could really say, that he was ethnically Silesian, since his family came from that region.

Sure, probably more convincing argument then German, but Silesians are just a mixture of German Polish and Czech. And his family had moved out of Silesia in the 13th century, his father was most likely born in Krakow. There is also his relationship to multiple Polish noble houses.

But I have no problem with him being ethnically mixed, but go read some of the comments and see how many dont even know he did actually have some Polish ancestry and tell you he was just ethnically German?

I have read 20th century German texts arguing he couldn't be Polish because Poland was too stupid of a country to have produced such an individual, its bad history and just insulting, which is why want to educate people.

&gt;So there was *Prussian* lands, and *Polish* King was ruling them.

I acknowledged this but, I highlighted the distinction between Ducal Prussia, actual Prussian lands, and Royal Prussia which was only called as an extension from being controlled by the TO but was never supposed to be in their domain and was originally Polish land, unlike the rest of Prussia which was inhabited by Prussians.

&gt;these lands and he *did* speak German

Never said he didn't.

&gt;I speak Polish and English fluently and I also know a little bit of Latin, German, Dutch and French. So what?

You are missing the point. I am not telling you must be English because you speak English, so there is no need for you to justify your self to me about your linguistic skill, but people ignore all context and argue he was German because he spoke German or from a German speaking area, some don't even know he knew Polish language.

&gt;The point is that he was a scholar, and scholars want to school or to be schooled. If it was German state that offered the same level of liberties for his homeland, which was Regal Prussia, I bet he would conspire against Polish crown

Again you are making this up. He didn't choose Poland because they offered him an education, he was already born into a family that were Polish loyalists. His Grandfather was wounded fighting the TO, his uncle which raised him after his father died was called the ""incarnation of the devil"" by the TO. His parents helped finance Poland's war.

And he wasn't a scholar **untill** after he was  educated in Krakow by Albert Brudzewski, **Poland made him** a scholar.

Did you know after the war he created a program to resettle Olsztyn with Polish speaking Mazovians?  What does that have to do with him being a scholar?

&gt;Mazovia, was not part of Poland until 1526, long after Copernicus died

Again bad history, Copernicus died in 1543,  and Mazovia was a part of Poland before 1526, Don't you know about the testament of Boleslaw?

Edit: Let me add to that you tried to trivialize this by saying they are people who were just loyal to the same King, they actually had a feud with the polish King who did not want Copernicus uncle as Warma prince. Yet after that he was advisory to 3 Kings that came after him.",,/r/europe/comments/f67qqn/on_this_day_547_years_ago_nicolas_copernicus_was/fi8mfty/,anon086421,1582243502

1873,"No, it isn't. That's the whole point.

If you would allow to abolish democracy by a Democratic decision (like a referendum, or a huge majority in parliament), that might be democratically legitimized in the very moment that it is done. However, future generations would be deprived of their right to make democratic decisions themselves.

This would mean that in such a ""democracy"", the democratic system would last only until the antidemocrats win for the first time. Imagine that in each election, there is a 99% chance of democrats winning and a 1% chance of antidemocrats winning. Seems not to bad, right? However, this means that after *n* elections, the probability of still having a democracy is (99%)^*n*. For *n*→ ∞, the probability of having a democracy goes to zero. This means, sooner or later, such a democracy would abolish itself.

On the other hand, making sure democracy doesn't get abolished may be contrary to the ""democratic"" will of the majority at the time of the vote, but it ensures that later generations retain the right to make decisions. So it's a net win for democracy.

Likewise, a party whose goal it is to end democracy or human rights is set out to permanently deprive future generations of their rights, so with no majority whatsoever at any given point in time can their decisions be democratically legitimized.

Germany may be unusual in this regard, but the preservation of democracy and human rights weighs stronger than any majority at any given point in time ever could.

1940,"Social media. There, I said it.

""Back then"" fringe opinions tended to undergo collective scrutiny by society as a whole, which acted like a filter for ideas running counter to the ""social contract"", the agreed-upon consensus and common ground under which a nation operates.

Nowadays, however, this filter no longer exists as people isolate and radicalize themselves on the web more and more. You go to YouTube or Facebook etc and automatic algorithms feed you conspiracy theories as ""content of interest"", and subreddits like KIA or imageboards like 4chan serve as echo-chambers normalizing fringe behavior. The seeds of what we see today have been sown about ten years ago.

We have become a digital society and all of us spend *considerable* time online and with friends we made on the 'net, but our human psyche and regulatory system have not yet caught up with the digital revolution and its massive peddling of misinformation, at times steered from hostile nations outside seeking to undermine the democratic process, at other times just originating in some depressed and mentally unstable peoples' basements.

2095,"/u/undivided01 posted the article one minute after your comment and the article already contained the counter-argument to what you just said.

&gt; Some Polish officials think they need not worry about integration because Ukrainians are culturally very similar to Poles. They look the same, are mostly Christian and speak similar languages. However, similarities are an imperfect shield against prejudice. White, Christian, football-mad lager drinkers were hardly a rare breed in Britain before the arrival of hundreds of thousands of Poles in the noughties. Yet a backlash against immigration from eastern Europe boosted support for Brexit, which upended British politics. Confederation, a far-right Polish party, is crusading against foreign workers. Its mps bluntly state that national “purity” matters more than prosperity. So far, there is little interest: an anti-Ukrainian march by another party in 2018 drew only 10 people. But Poland has not tasted recession for nearly a generation, and who knows what might happen if the economy were to stall.

Now this analysis is obviously lacking, because both the British and the Ukrainians mostly belong to a free church, be it Anglican or Ukrainian Orthodoxy, while Poles are bound in servitude to the Papist creed of Rome. This is a major difference.

Another poignant detail is that they spend seven paragraphs and a sub-title arguing that the Ukrainians in Poland are probably there to stay, and then in the final paragraph they imply that the Ukrainians will be staying home or headed to Germany. A large minority of the Germans is Protestant and Lutheran, these are not just free religions, they are also True, which makes them a lot better people than Anglicans or the Orthodox, faiths deeply entwined with the state and the veneration of the ruler.

2201,"Sinn Fein needed to manoeuvre for a second general election so that they can run more candidates and gain more seats (they only ran 42 as they did not expect to do as well as they have done, 37 of those 42 elected). The other two major parties are much larger and ran 80+ candidates each. If Sinn Fein can double the amount of candidates and ride this wave of popular support, they could very easily form a rainbow coalition government with support of the smaller left wing parties. 

They've handled it fairly well, imho. They made sure to extend olive branches to both other major parties with a view to forming a government, in order to ward off a potential media narrative of Sinn Fein being 'afraid' to be in power (this has been a canard in media and certain parts of the electorate for decades). Both Fine Gael and large subsets of Fianna Fail have sworn off ever forming a government with Sinn Fein, so they now look like the ones who are refusing to compromise. I think this explains the higher numbers for Sinn Fein in the polls.

Some general things to keep in mind about Irish politics: 

* Since the formation of the Irish nation state, Fianna Fail or Fine Gael have always been in power, either alone or as the primary part of a coalition. 
* Fianna Fail and Fine Gael are conservative, centre-right parties, and there is little difference between them ideologically. They are distinguished by being on opposing sides of the Irish Civil War, and in more modern times having different demographic bases (e.g. farmers would broadly tend to support Fianna Fail).
* Fianna Fail were in power in the lead up to the financial crisis of 2008 which hit Ireland particularly hard. Fine Gael implemented brutal austerity budgets and have presided over a major housing crisis.
* Sinn Fein are viewed as a broadly left party but have ties to IRA and terrorist activity in the 60s and 70s. This is why certain politicians will never allie with them in government. To many, they are not seen as a legitimate political party.
* The latest election is hugely significant because it represents Sinn Fein's transition to political legitimacy and a shedding of the IRA-adjacent old guard, and because it is the weakest the other two major parties have ever been. If current trends continue, we will be the first left wing government in the history of the Irish state.",Ireland,/r/europe/comments/f6uedw/ireland_leftwing_sinn_féin_would_surge_to_a_17/fi73hd6/,funglegunk,1582213512

&gt;The 43-year-old wrote that thousands of Germans are being monitored by an ominous secret service. This agency, it says in the letter, has employees ""who are able to read another person's mind and who are also able to 'tune into it' and to a certain extent 'remote control' them.""

&gt;Much of the letter explains Tobias R.'s racist and right-wing extremist worldview. Even as a young man, he developed the opinion that the ""bad behavior of certain ethnic groups"" was a problem. He also claims that Islam is ""destructive"".

&gt;""These people are instinctively to be rejected and their history has proven them not to be productive,"" he writes about immigrants, and: ""Conversely, I got to know my own people as a country from which the best and most beautiful arises and grows, what this world has to offer. "" The Germans ""would have raised humanity as a whole"".

&gt;Among other things, he lists more than two dozen states whose population he believes should be destroyed, and questions the question of how many Germans are ""pure-bred and valuable"" (""I can imagine halving the population""). R. also raises the question of whether mankind as a whole is a ""winning species"" that can answer the question ""what is actually going on here"" at some point.

&gt;A passage that deals with time travel shows exactly how irrational this world view is: ""Also, we have to go around in a 'time loop' and destroy the planet we call our home before the first life came into existence billions of years ago, because we cannot let happen everything that has ever happened on earth, let happen the suffering of millions""

The UK is currently going through a huge structural change right now with respect to Brexit, there is already a lot of economic uncertainty, it simply isn't the time to rerun Indyref. If you were being practical you'd recognise that to make an informed decision on independence, it's better to wait until the dust has settled on the Brexit trauma and see how the UK is doing outside of the EU. Surely that will be a factor in most peoples decisions?

Never mind that:

- Polls do NOT find a majority for holding a second indyref *this* year, as the SNP keeps insisting upon.
- No other country in the world would re-run a plebiscite of this nature just 6 years after the last
- Your reasons for doing so, 'Brexit changes everything', lack credibility since informed voters at the time of Indyref couldn't discount a UK vote on EU membership in the medium term (David Cameron speech in 2013, Lib Dem manifesto in 2010, etc...)

Honestly, it's not practical, and its not something that a majority of your countrymen even support within the time frame the secessionists are proposing. The SNP are doing this for ideological reasons because they are *obsessed* with achieving independence.

Since you already opened the door to silencing opinions, can you make sure that I'll be heard?  


I hear the ""paradox of tolerant"" but I have a different example. I come from a country where a neonazi party gained popularity during the financial crisis. People voted/supported them as an antisystemic party. The media decided to ""silence"" this party, because they were ""bad"". Do you know what happened? Their popularity went even higher. Especially with younger people.  


""I don't like the system, the system doesn't like Neo-Nazis/Neo-Nazis don't like the system, therefore I should go with the Neo-Nazis"". Yes, it's a failed train of thoughts (?) but it is a real one.  


Unfortunatelly I had more than a few conversations with people who thought that supporting that party was Resistance!

The far-right doesn't have a solution for the real problems our societies are facing, primarily about the Economy. They just have ""solutions""/fireworks that are based on irrational fears of people. The answer to far-right (IMO) is not to silence them, but rather to LET THEM SPEAK. Let everyone hear what they have to say and understand that they are bullshit. Fight their ideas in action, not their ability to express those!

2400,"&gt;it simply isn't the time to rerun Indyref.

It is precisely the time. Scotland overwhelmingly rejected Brexit, so shouldn't have to endure the pain caused by it.

&gt;Polls do NOT find a majority for holding a second indyref this year, as the SNP keeps insisting upon.

That is not the same as support for independence. Plenty of die-hard independence supporters want to hold off until the base is stronger. It doesn't mean they wouldn't back independence tomorrow.

&gt;No other country in the world would re-run a plebiscite of this nature just 6 years after the last

Plenty of countries run multiple referenda a year.

&gt;Your reasons for doing so, 'Brexit changes everything', lack credibility since informed voters at the time of Indyref couldn't discount a UK vote on EU membership in the medium term

[Aye?](https://twitter.com/uk_together/status/506899714923843584?lang=en)

Scotland did not vote for a UK that was leaving he EU. This is revisionist nonsense used to undermine calls for independence.

&gt;and its not something that a majority of your countrymen even support within the time frame the secessionists are proposing

But, as we both know, the majority now support it in general. Timeframe isn't the issue.

&gt;what good reasons for having a referendum now (whilst emotions are high and uncertainty is rife) versus in another 5-10 years when we will know what the UKs relationship with the EU is like and what the outcomes of Brexit are.

Because in a functional democracy, the population of a country in a union should be able to decide if they want to remain in that Union by consent, not by force, when something fundamental changes that they oppose.

2508,"The thing is Spanish police statistics are notoriously accurate, due to Spain never dismantling it's police state set up by Franco (hence there's more police per capita in Spain today than during Soviet Russia or North Korea), and many police forces duplicate the same roles over the same regions, sometimes 4 forces all doing the exact same thing (Spain has 28 totally individual police forces in total, all with the same legal powers)... It's why you have to give your passport and another ID like bank card which gets photocopied even when you check into an Airbnb or the tiniest of hotels, let alone major chains, and at night the various police forces all come around and collect those photocopies and upload them into their databases. 

You're also monitored a lot closer than you might realise for such a seemingly relaxed country during your stay, your digital profile from arriving at the airport is filled with data such as your photo every time you take cash from an ATM (another legal requirement banks have to comply with), and some airports even make you hand over fingerprints even if you're an EU citizen (like certain Madrid Barajas terminals). 

All of this to say, it's very easy to look at the data published by the Spanish Ministry of the Interior every year and see exactly how many of each nationality were staying in each place, for how long, doing what, spending what, and what crimes (if any) they were committing, all this data is public. There are some regions which are apparently ""notorious"" with the locals for British drunk hooligans, yet when you look at the data or actually live there (after having lived in Britain and knowing the various accents), show not a single British person or family may have been to the entire region all year. British people can fly to the Caribbean and Barbados for 150 Euros, and places in the US like Miami or Disneyland Florida for similar prices... and even the poorest working class have such incredible amounts of disposable income by mainland European standards (for example the average salary in Spain is 700 Euros / 585 GBP a month), that it makes no sense for them to go to cheap resorts on the Costa del Sol or other ""notorious"" regions anymore, especially when they have to fly to get anywhere anyway. 

I'm not denying British people drink a lot, but in my time living in both the UK and Spain, I rarely found British people to be the ones actually causing any trouble, infact I rarely ever saw other British people full stop outside tiny coastal towns where they usually live in their own isolated communities, and the official Spanish state police statistics, along with Eurostat and Europol back that up.",Gibraltar,/r/europe/comments/f6dayw/the_impressively_clean_streets_of_split_croatia/fi6f4os/,RehabMan,1582191837

2552,"The media has used combative language and framed the outstanding issues in ways to exacerbate tensions, because outrage media sells better.  The reality is that these are negotiations.  Differing sides always begin with their most extreme demands.  However, Europeans have a culture of compromise and are strong negotiators because of it.  They will form an agreement, and neither sides' negotiating positions will perfectly reflect the outcome, regardless of how staunch their positions appear.

As regards the specifics, what I meant by Poland and Hungary increasing contributions was that they would be willing to receive less.  Every member state (barring rebates) pays the same percentage of GNI, so of course ""increase contribution"" means receive less.  Poland even claimed it wanted to become a net contributor this decade.  France has always defended the CAP, but it looks like it is inevitable it gets cut at least some in this budget.  Macron simply has to look as tough as possible before that happens.  Germany btw has already committed to the increased budget percent, worried that without it the Union's cohesiveness may be at risk.  Merkel wants her legacy to be a stable Europe, and that's what she's delivering here.  The media makes everyone's blood boil and hearts pump over this, with an added Brexit plot device, but I refuse to get caught up on the fervor in the face of precedent and reality.","Minnesota, America",/r/europe/comments/f6ez9c/tensions_mount_between_eu_members_ahead_of_budget/fi69gvc/,Trayeth,1582184157

2582,"First , I never thought you’re Nazi sympathizer, you used very harsh words and accusations so yeah, it escalated.

Matter of Jew/Polish victims. Problem is you used Nazi definitions to say there was no genocide of Poles. These definitions were twisted, Jewish grandparent could mean a Pole or a German could be recorded as Jew and sent to die,  these numbers are false. Germany absolutely had the plans to wipe out everything Polish from existence and it was happening, Jews were first, Poles and other Slavs were bigger task and planned for more years but it was happening. 


Matter of reparations. Not easy. There is obviously enormous crime on German side and enormous losses on Polish side with some apologies by German politicians but no genuine atonement or reconciliation. There is obvious all human need to be treated fairly and fact that Germany made so much effort in reconciliation with relatively lightly occupied French and other Western countries and almost no effort to reconcile with country where the worst was done is very problematic.

Let me remind you also that whole thing was raised as aftermath of whole Nord Stream case. This was the affair that disillusioned Poles, it turned out that Poland is not treated as family which was popular way of thinking about EU or even a valued partner but easily dismissed nuisance, shunned and ridiculed for daring to oppose plans to circumvent Poland, hurt her economy and security. Pro German parties were in disgrace for fooling everyone, Tusk confirmed worst by escaping to cozy position in Brussels.

The number of times muslim lead and christian lead administrative units fought hand in hand  against a third one (be it Christian or Muslim lead) proves the construct of reconquista is not at all what it has been made to be.

If it takes you 8 centuries its no ""reconquest"", should Spain go invade North Africa because 13 centuries ago it was a Christian led administrative unit of Rome? How legitimate wluld that be?

Also, take into account that at most points Muslim lead administrative units had large Christian citizen minorities (mozarabs) and vice versa (muladis).

2720,"Well, could promote The Netherlands as I live here.

But really, instead of settling and sticking to a country, why don't you travel around a bit and found out what you like?

The EU has great public transport, buses, trains and planes. It's all fairly cheap too (car is cheaper, but first you'd need the car - and park it places, which is dear).

Staying places doesn't have to be expensive either. The continent is littered with hostels and motels. Lots of hostels for under E10 a night. Not sure how Euro weighs against your currency, or even if you've got a bit saved up.

But travel a bit. Being fluent in English helps a lot. Countries where you can at least easily make yourself understood pretty much all of the West side, fair amount in the middle and some on the East Side. (insert ""West Side is the best"" Ali G joke) The notable exception is of course France, where people are so arrogant to think the whole world should just learn French :p

But yea, travel a bit. Don't judge a whole country on 1 city, you might've picked a shitty one. For example, if you go to The Netherlands, don't judge the whole country on just Amsterdam.

2727,"I think you are mistaken. Countries are far apart. Of course Hungary and Poland want to increase their contributions. For every euro they contribute they get more than 3 euro's back in spending in their countries. The big problem is that to get the agreement of Germany and the Netherlands, spending has to go down, not up. And Germany and the Netherlands demand a large rebate that does not decline over time, which is a very bitter pill to swallow for France. 

As for the increasing expenditure by 0.1%, that is 100 billion euro to be spent over 7 years. The real problem that the Netherlands and its allies have is that the money is spent on completely the wrong priorities from their point of view and that Poland and their allies will fight tooth and nail to keep spending it on the wrong stuff because that benefits them. And then 100 billion is an extremely large amount of money, even if it's just 0.1%. It is very disingenuous to paint this as a fight between frugal anti-europeans and pro-europeans who are willing to invest in europe. You can just as easily describe this as a fight by countries wanting to spend money just because they are not paying for it and want to keep spending it on the wrong priorities, just because it benefits them vs. countries who would like to spend more on the priorities of the future but refuse to keep paying for the hobbies of the rest at the same time.",,/r/europe/comments/f6ez9c/tensions_mount_between_eu_members_ahead_of_budget/fi66j4v/,slvk,1582180761

2749,"&gt; 143TWh is still much less than what France or Sweden managed to do with nuclear. 

France did more relative and absolute, sweden just did more relative. 

The Problem with nuclear is planning. the average planning and building time back then in Germany was 7-10 years for a nuclear power plant. That would be now a lost decade. Offshore has the largest planning and building time in renewable with 1-3 years.


&gt;Also, construction of new wind farms in Germany is slowing down and some old turbines already have to be replaced.

Yes that's sadly also governments fault and a reason the year 2019 wasn't as great as before. Offshore and solar picked up for it again. 
Even though through arbitrary limits solar is not growing as fast as it could. 


&gt;Have a look at this, specifically ""devoting all German land to wind power would meet about 70% of Germany’s total primary energy consumption"". It's relatively easy to generate 30% of your electricity from wind (especially if you can import electricity from countries like France or Poland) but getting to 100% is impossible.

First of all we are still a major exporter  and you mean Sweden and France, while it's also been this year that France is exporting to us and that's physically flow could mean that Energy is not meant for Germany sadly we need to wait if is it also commercial flow. For the last years it was not the case.

This study is interesting and talks about primary Energy consumption using US data on German soil. I found no study for Germany based on primary Energy consumption, but one based on electricity which states depending on how much each is used around 2-2,5% of the surface area of Germany.  We have great Windenergy especially in North and our solar is okay and especially good in the South.


&gt;I highly recommend reading Sustainable Energy – without the hot air.

I read a bit, but sadly it's partially outdated, especially in the renewable as they bin consistent changes since. It's over ten years old and the writer is sadly already dead. Some nice information there, but it's interesting I will read completely later.


&gt;The fact that new nuclear power plants are not built on time in Western Europe is not a technical problem, but a political one.

Yes, but most things are not technical problems regarding stopping climate change, not matter which route you use. Even though the Problems are also economic nature.


&gt;People in Germany are against nuclear power thanks to green lobbying groups but it's unscientific and it's hurting the planet.

What is a unscientific fact by green lobby groups? The biggest issue in Germany about nuclear was weapons and waste. Waste is an issue even though the amount is small compared to other waste the solution is not as easy in Germany. 


&gt;Nuclear power plants are built on time or ahead of schedule in China.

China is no measurement for things like that. China is building nearly everything faster than the most developed countries as their system is different. 


&gt; Even Belarus is building a nuclear power plant on time right now. I'm sure Germany could do the same if it wanted to.


Russia builds a nuclear power plant. The only a amount of companies building those. I think Germany should stick to renewables. If it's done building it's likely the coal exit already happen by itself. 


&gt;Carbon footprint of nuclear power plants is mostly related to construction costs but it's so low when you account for how long these plants operate that it can be offset by planting trees.

baseload != dispatchable  and dispatchable power plants are not needed.  peak is Gas or Hyrdo. 

Fluctating energy sources are viable especially to power to x technology like power to gas or power to heat.

&gt;No, I am not new to this, but I don't like the hand-waving and future promises the Greens make once you show them the math.

Please show me the math and please explain Scientist at the Fraunhofer-Institut für Solare Energiesysteme or other research institute your math.


&gt; And I know how great our saving efforts have been since after the GDR industry was demolished and the low hanging fruit gone.

https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/germanys-greenhouse-gas-emissions-and-climate-targets

We are reducing since 1978, while the unification and the loss of Industry show a drop it's not the low hanging fruit, in contrast to the energy sector. 


&gt;Even if it's only a 3x there's no chance to build as many green power stations, we are running out of space as we type.

Any numbers to back it up, while space is a worry for the primary energy consumption, for Electricity Generation is far more than enough 2-2,5 % are not much, less than our roads and in contrast to roads wind mills only need a small area to stand on. 


https://www.wwf.de/themen-projekte/klima-energie/deutsche-klimapolitik/zukunft-stromsystem-2/


And we are not running out at space as we speak. About 13% of Germany are suited for onshore.


&gt;And no, there's not a ton of future efficiency to be harvested for on-shore wind or PV panels.


Did say who? 
We could ask Fraunhofer-Institut für Solare Energiesysteme  who hold the world record for efficiency in solar efficiency. Which is 19% more than the current Industrial used PV.


The Problem is more that we are still investing not enough in trains, buses and bike lanes. That renewable have forced caps and no meaningful CO2 tax.

&gt; I do expect these opinions to change quickly in an actual conflict. It's also why we have tripwire forces. Of course people now don't want to get involved in a war, but once it happens that can quickly change.

It's true that opinions could quickly change.  My biggest concern with these poll results isn't that they prove these nations would betray the alliance, but that they indicate a very low priority towards military spending/readiness among the populace which can translate to the politicians that represent them.  And if an enemy senses that their target has a low capability/willingness to fight, it may invite aggression that otherwise wouldn't exist.

So yeah, if an attack was imminent it may change those poll numbers, but by then it's a bit late to wish you had capable military force.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/f6hkmk/nato_publics_more_likely_to_believe_us_would/fi5idsr/,Shmorrior,1582163796

Diocletian was one of the last great emperors before the split between east and west, he basically got the ball rolling on. He also was vehemently against Christianity, the last and bloodiest purge of Christians was enforced by him. When he retired, he went back to his villa where Split is now. Hundreds of years later, his mausoleum was converted into the Cathedral of Saint Domnius.

2887,"Firstly, it's better to master English before responding to someone if it isn't your first language.

Secondly, no, we don't. There is a difference between the U.S. and ""most"" EU countries, we are a country of over 350 million people with different types of problems, ""most"" EU countries consist of under 5 million people with most of the population living in the capital with aggravated assault being considered a national tragedy. What a regular country to you guys is like what Maine is to us. Our violent crime rate constantly decreases year after year as gun ownership rates go up, and it doesn't stop huge rates of violence via firearm from being recorded in gun controlled cities like Chicago, Detroit, D.C., Baltimore, etc. Not to even mention to someone like you that dozens of countries 10x smaller than us surpass us in levels of gun deaths even despite their regulation. Would you like to understand why? Because the root of the problem of violence doesn't boil down to the object you think is scary, there are factors that lead the perpetrator to commit the violence and that is what needs to be taken care of. Taking away a piece of metal doesn't change a murderous mindset, and taking said piece of metal away will not stop a criminal by definition from breaking a law and obtaining a firearm. 

And by the way, buddy, this is like the 5th time I've heard of a mass shooting in Germany this year, and I'm not talking about homicides via gun, I mean genuine mass shootings that have occurred within the first 2 months of 2020. And gun control isn't stopping it.

Does this detailed response better clear up your confusion?

It's frequently the case for people to find that it's cheaper to meet with somebody from the other end of the country in Spain then to travel by train.

2913,"you're a little confused about this topic if you look at it at a one sided angle this hard.

firstly, we are a much larger nation than germany. country of 350 million people compared to 80 million. guess what in addition? they have a low homicide rate regardless of weapon use. now consider another smaller european country and their rate of violence, like the u.k. for example. would you like to know how they're doing? they have high rates of knife and acid crime, and violent crime only countries to skyrocket annually. 

in addition to this, buddy, we aren't the top nation for mass shootings, which we have 4 or 5 a year of. the ""395"" mass shooting thing you always hear are shootings consisting of separate homicides and gang violence, they aren't the type of mass shooting where you think someone shot up a walmart or a movie theatre. there are 4 or so of these you see on CNN every year, why do you think you can name so little for a country of our size over our entire history?

second, we are not even in the top 10 nations for levels of gun homicide or mass shootings per capita, which other european countries beat us at. wanna know why i'm sharing this information with you? so you can understand that ""gun"" violence isn't limited to the scary object that is used, but rather to the perpetrator that is pushed to not lead a normal life and have to commit this violence in the first place. imagine a country like norway, virtually no assaults, murders, suicides, anything. peaceful country with peaceful people, gun control having literally nothing to do with its low levels of self harm or harm to others. now take a country like honduras, which has about 9 million plus people. it has much more gun violence than the entirety of the u.s., and violence is at an all time high. difference is that these nations both restrict guns, even norway is more lenient than honduras, and guess what? it still has high levels of violence, not just by firearm, and gun control doesn't stop it. because gun control doesn't stop violence nor does it stop a criminal mindset, and a criminal by definition will break the law. simply because they can. gun control is just an emotional response by those too weak minded to solve a complex issue.

I read it right here on /r/Europe that the US bases don't protect them.  They are only springboards for military adventures in the Middle East, which do nothing but cause death and refugee streams to Europe.  This line of argument is compelling and difficult to refute.

3110,"No, social darwinism wasn't uniquely German, but it formed into Nazism exactly in Germany because of the pre-existing conditions that were present in Germany. Of course there was an element of coincidence in there as well and I am not saying the only pre-condition was that the German society disliked Jews and Slavs, but it was one of the elements there. 

I guess I will just conclude this debate by saying that I am not talking about this only because I am from a slavic country, I am not trying to paint us as the biggest victim here, I obviously fully understand that Jewish and Roma people had it worse, but at the same time, I think it's counterproductive when the debates gets reduced to Jews only and this is what you very often see in Germany.

What can happen as a result is that the whole WW2 Nazi experience gets basically reduced to ""antisemitism bad"" when in reality what happened could be seen as pretty universal, something that can happen to many other nations/ethnicities. 

So what I am saying here is not that Germans as a nation are somehow prone to genocide or anything, I am just saying that when you have certain pre-conditions present, like an ideology that justifies conquest as something not just okay, but as something completely natural, and at the same time, you have a dominant view of your neigbours as a bunch of uncivilized savages, then horrible things can happen and that's what happened in Germany in the 30s along with other things that pushed the country over the wedge.",Czech Republic,/r/europe/comments/f5j9ee/macron_broke_the_nuclear_taboo_poland_rebuffs/fi4vi9h/,kristynaZ,1582149279

3148,"&gt;I had been immigrant myself for many years till we moved back to my home-country in my mid-teens because of some family issues and desperation. The problem was though, that i had been living in that foreign country since early childhood and grew up with that culture instead of that of my parents. I didn't even really know how to speak or write in my native language and etc. when i returned to Georgia as 15 year old kid.  However, i learned how to speak, read, write and soon actually became fluent in just a few years. I guess what really helped me, besides the will and desire to learn, is that i actively tried to communicate with other people and  consumed local media.

My family has lived in many places of the Dutch Kingdom, and always have been very practical about things. I never learned my mom's native tongue (Papiamento) for example. Sometimes she would say it was to not have us have a accent or just wants us to talk fluent Dutch without an accent (even though she doesn't even have an accent herself). But as everything goes, the family worked in the oil industry there, and when that ended moved back or away again. The family is divided in what language they speak, but everyone speaks Dutch. My grandparents had homes in Netherlands and on the Caribbean.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I can definitely sympathize with their struggles to integrate into the  new culture. However, i also believe that it wouldn't be such big of a  problem for many of them if they had the desire to improve. I also know  people in UK and Ireland where their kids don't really struggle in  school or with social interactions, even though their parents can barely  speak English. 

I can sympathize as well, and there is a part of me that sees the fault in not having a practical attitude about living life as a local. In much ways the past is the past, and everything shifts in time. I would shudder to think how my life would be if my family kept their old traditions of black cloth Catholics. My parents didn't feel the need to force religion on me like their parents have done on them.

And that is where the idea's of sending Imams over from foreign countries really grinds my gear. The idea is not religion or religious freedom, it is a foreign way to keep a part of their old population in line and keeping the people away from the society that is their new future.

There is no doubt that there is some kind of hunt for me. It started with an unjustified deletion of the YouTube channel (March 2019), switching off the Google monetization on [wPrawowo.pl](https://wPrawowo.pl) (June 2019), 5 charges (August-December 2019), production and publication by lieutenants about me (2019 - passim), entry of the Security Agency into my home (December 13th 2019) and seizure of the clothing I sell in the store that gives me income and seizure of my mobile phones and laptops. Seeing that in this way Międlara cannot be broken, the time has come for truly idiotic acts of indictment, which - as empirically suggests - are likely to be sticking by equally idiotic (un)justice.

Two weeks ago, in response to the notification of the centre established by a criminal, Rafał Gawła, and the Wrocław police, which 'became famous' for brutal beatings of the participants of the Patriots' March (11 November 2019), prosecutor Justyna Trzcińska charged me under Article 126 of the Criminal Code, for which the code provides for the lowest punishment of 3 months' imprisonment. The indictment, which contains obvious lies (details during the hearing on 12 February 2020, 10 a.m., SO in Wrocław, room 126), and which has already been notified to the relevant authorities, is evidence that the justice system requires a profound reform. Today (20.01.2020) I received another letter, with another indictment. In fact, every other day I receive some ""gifts"" from the court, prosecutor's office or police.

Małgorzata Szymańska, prosecutor of PR Wrocław-Stare Miasto, accused me of committing an offence under Article 256 § 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. (who publicly propagates the fascist or other totalitarian system of the state or incites to hatred against the background of national, ethnic, racial or religious differences or because of their lack of faith,

shall be subject to a fine, restriction of liberty or imprisonment for up to 2 years.) For the less aware: Article 256 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is a provision in practice that serves the purpose of ""bludgeoning"" those who have the audacity to publicly criticise and name various manifestations of anti-Polonism and perversion. This indictment concerns two events.

The first one, of 11 November 2018, when I had the courage to call on Poles to 'fight against evil' and indicate that 'this is our time because we do not deal with communists, Zionists, bankers, traitors, with ordinary enemies'. Prosecutor Szymanska also did not like the fact that I reminded that ""there are many people who are Polish, like Róża Thun, like Donald Tusk and like that Dutkiewicz with a pancake on his head"". The second event took place on 4 August 2018. Then, after the left-handed threats of burning down the premises where my author's meeting was to take place, we moved to the Wrocław market square. The author's meeting was disturbed by the singing of communist songs by Left-wing circles, which without consequence challenged Polish patriots, destroyed the sound equipment, and I, in the presence of the officers, was drenched with a corrosive solution. It was then, after singing the Polish anthem, drowned out by Marta Lempart and her acolytes, that I tried to lead a meeting of authors, during which I explained to those present what my publication concerns. The topics I addressed in my book ""Moja walka o prawdę"" (""My fight for the truth""), which is the salt in the eye of dyed foxes and polakożercy, also did not appeal to the said prosecutor. Justifying the indictment, she stated that the character of ""hate speech"" had the memory that the founder of the paedophile organization NAMBLA was a Jew from LGBT. That I condemn holocaust mathematics (6-2.5=6), that I criticize the ill-considered financing of Jewish Jewish cemeteries and - note - that there is disproportionate mention of liquidated Jews, but forgets about the 10 million Slavs murdered. Finally, Szymańska said that I committed a crime because I criticized...

"" In 1624 Galileo went to Rome and had six interviews with Urban VIII.

(he was wrong) The pope gave Galileo permission to write a book about theories of the universe but warned him to treat the Copernican theory only hypothetically (and stick to mathematical arguments , and avoid theological one). The book, *Dialogo sopra i due massimi sistemi del mondo, tolemaico e copernicano* ([*Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems, Ptolemaic &amp; Copernican*](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Dialogue-Concerning-the-Two-Chief-World-Systems-Ptolemaic-and-Copernican)), was finished in 1630, and Galileo sent it to the Roman censor. Because of an outbreak of the [plague](https://www.britannica.com/science/plague), communications between Florence and Rome were interrupted, and Galileo asked for the censoring to be done instead in Florence. The Roman censor had a number of serious [criticisms](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/criticisms) of the book and forwarded these to his colleagues in Florence. After writing a preface in which he professed that what followed was written hypothetically, Galileo had little trouble getting the book through the Florentine censors, and it appeared in Florence in 1632.

For anyone who wants a quick primer: Sinn Fein, the Center-Left-that-desperately-wishes-it-was-proper-left party, got a *huge* surge in the recent election, and there's a possibility of a second election (but I personally doubt it). It's such an unexpected sudden surge that, in a lot of places, they just didn't even have enough politicians for the proportional support. If there is another election, they're bound to add more...

...although I don't know how more.

AOC, author of the Green New Deal, said: ""The world is gonna end in 12 years if we don't address climate change and your biggest issue is how are we gonna pay for it?""

Neil Degrasse Tyson and Bill Nye (who said he ""would be open to"" jail time for climate change deniers) routinely cite sea level figures multiple times higher than the IPCC report.

The founder of Extinction Rebellion said that billions (with a b) will die and that ""Our children are going to die in the next ten to twenty years""

Greta Thunberg said by 2030 we will set off an irreversible chain reaction that ""will lead to the end of our civilization as we know it.""

"" At this time, Galileo also engaged in a dispute over the reasons that objects float or sink in water, siding with [Archimedes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes)  against Aristotle. The debate was unfriendly, and Galileo's blunt and  sometimes sarcastic style, though not extraordinary in academic debates  of the time, made him enemies.  During this controversy one of Galileo's friends, the painter Lodovico Cardi da Cigoli, informed him that a group of malicious opponents, which Cigoli subsequently referred to derisively as ""the Pigeon league"",\[10\] was plotting to cause him trouble over the motion of the Earth, or anything else that would serve the purpose.\[11\] According to Cigoli, one of the plotters asked a priest to denounce Galileo's views from the pulpit, but the latter refused.

Cows have a natural inclination to walk and explore. They are also social animals and cow mummies have a strong bond with their kids. All this natural behaviour is prevented by factory farms. Cows are stuck in shit-stained concentration camps (sounds harsh but really that's what it is), they can't walk, can't herd and cow mums are separated from their kids.

It's disgusting. We don't need lower standards, we need way higher standards. EU doesn't have particularly high ones. A litre of milk costs less than a Euro, when it should cost at least around €1.50 to be remotely cow-friendly. People are perfectly willing to spend money on new smartphones, fast food and whatever the fuck.

3525,"&gt;That said, I do think that the Elgin marbles should be returned, because they are half of a set and should be reunited with the other half in Athens. It would be like half of the Mona Lisa being in Paris and the other half in Rome, incomplete.  
&gt;  
&gt;But, it shouldn’t enter into the Brexit discussions, it’s an emotive and irrelevant issue. As far as I can tell, it’s not even being requested and many in this thread have completely missed the point.

Agreed. This is the main reason we're asking for the Elgin marbles and not every random artifact that exists all over the world. I wouldn't want everything returned but Greece feels like this piece is a special case for it. 

I also agree with the last paragraph. It's a bit cringy to do that but on the other hand Greece has been trying asking nicely for decades to no avail. I remember that the UK's/British Museum's argument was that Greece wouldn't be able to properly host and take care of the marbles. Then Greece built the brand new Acropolis museum specifically for that purpose so that argument went out the window and the UK was still like ""well..no"".

Multilingualism and biliteracy has been shown to improve children’s examination results and is valuable in academic research and in the business world, while interpreters are necessary in the courts, hospitals etc etc where there are often shortages of interpreters. It also can improve parents’ attitudes towards their children’s education when taught in the younger years. Not to mention I personally believe it can reduce radicalisation which has sometimes been connected with w feeling of alienation from both heritage culture and the country they live in’s cultures, so the state offering e.g Algerian Arabic instruction provides a unifying way of reducing that sense of division, giving children feelings of cultural pride and learning that it is possible and good to identify both as French and as someone of Algerian heritage.

3568,"&gt;I really don't get the point of drivers having to retun to the country and their company all the time? Can someone explain the rationale behind that?

Currently Eastern European truck drivers are registered in their home country but effectively work in the Western parts of Europe. By the rules as intended, they are supposed to be registered where they work. But their companies avoid that, because that means they have to follow local labor laws and payment standards, which are usually substantially higher in the West. So the requirement of making truck drivers go back means that they are now taken on their word: they are officially saying that their drivers are working in Eastern Europe, so if that's true, then it's not a problem for them to drop in at their working place from time to time. And if it *is* a problem, then those drivers probably should be registered elsewhere.

So it's a measure to avoid a race to the bottom in truck driver wages and labor circumstances, and the companies who complain about it now are just mad they have to treat their employees like human beings instead of some kind of robots that don't need wages or sleep.",Limburg,/r/europe/comments/f689kt/nine_eu_countries_voice_opposition_to_eu_mobility/fi3dhb0/,silverionmox,1582112840

&gt;How about the rule where the TRUCK has to come back to its country, are we hurting the trucks feelings as well by not letting it come home every month or something?

They can simply register the truck in another country, where it's actually used.

&gt;What about the nonexisting hotels with secure truck parking where the drivers have to make their weekend rest or everyone gets fined, both the driver and company?

An excellent business opportunity for the enterprising person in those home countries.

&gt; What about the constant immigrants entering trucks going to UK and drivers and companies being found at fault? What about the constant theft of fuel and cargo which police doesn't care about anywhere?

Whataboutism.

&gt;Don't even get me started on all the paperwork every country comes up with lately, all the emissions stickers for each country/city that do nothing at all, just check that this brand new truck really is euro 6 , we'll use the same papers that it already carries with it to make sure, god forbid you don't have the sticker, here's a huge fine.

If those people were to leave after a Spanish takeover it would probably be even better for Spain, because then Spain can settle the land with a native Spanish population which would, in the eyes of the Spanish government, certainly be preferable than native Brits.

On the other hand, it's a tiny enclave on the Iberian peninsula right next to an important choke point into the Mediterranean. Not to mention that the Brits have little business being there anymore these days while Spain does have a historical and geographical claim to the land.

&gt;  
&gt;Desperate families in Plymouth without a penny to their name are going days without any food before reaching out for help.  
&gt;  
&gt;That's the heartbreaking admission from Plymouth Foodbank as its band of unsung heroes strive to protect those in most need.  
&gt;  
&gt;The vital lifeline has warned of a rise in the number of people on Universal Credit left starving - in part because of the dreaded six-week wait for pay for new claimants.  
&gt;  
&gt;Some sadly lack the lack the ability to budget between payday and break down in tears and eat the second they get their hands on a donated food parcel, in harrowing shades of I, Daniel Blake.  
&gt;  
&gt;The TV welfare drama features a traumatising scene with a gaunt-looking single mum who resorts to eating a tin of cold baked beans at her local food bank after going days without a meal.  
&gt;  
&gt;Shockingly, more than third of all food voucher recipients last year in Plymouth were kids from hard-up homes in places like Stonehouse and Devonport.  
&gt;  
&gt;Others are in work but don't pay enough to eat - they can only pay the household bills and nothing more.

Yep, a lot of Turks and Moroccans in Netherlands come from the ass-end of those countries. And all it did was change the Dutch perspective of those countries. Moroccans are still depicted as violent, but people don't realize that most of the workers here where Berbers for example.

Berbers have generally been rural and low educated in all of their their history, even by their Arab brethren. And people here expected them to assimilate and not be a problem or go back to their mountain villages. They are not the norm for the average Moroccan.

3694,"That's an incredibly hard question to answer.

Many older people are nostalgic because to them that era was a time of a worry-free life with consistent economic growth (funded by foreign debt) and relative freedom (compared to earlier times). The core part of Kádár's system was that if you were apolitical and not too much of an outsider then you could just live your life in peace. Not quite at western living standards or level of freedom, but better than the rest of the eastern block. Then this is combined with the ever present ""old times were better"" kind of nostalgia.

After '89 the old regime obviously was villified by most parties (usually rightfully so), and the change brought about a mirade of economic problems as well. Thus here are at a point when for 30 years the ""communists"" were the scapegoats for most of the problems (fidesz propaganda loves calling every neolib party communist).

My guess is that most people love the ""freedom fighter"" image where they are in a constant struggle with some cartoon evil villain, while being generally very much ok to give up a ton of personal freedom to have a comforatble apolitical life.

""the Appian Way the queen of the long roads""

Where you could argue that since both Russia and China both have high yield weapons, that neither of them would risk using a low yield. I would think the opposite would be true. That mutually assured destruction would stop scaring people at one point. 

2. I am not referencing video games. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_electromagnetic_pulse. Now whether I understand the concept or not is entirely up to debate and how much the field has changed in 15 years since I had any classes that remotely touched on anything like that. SO feel free to explain. Wikipedia can only make up so much for a lack scientific knowledge. 

3. Don't be an idiot. No one in their right heads would want Russia gone- between the chaos and the sheer radicalism that would take over in certain parts, the a black market nuke would more then likely end up somewhere. Not something anyone with a brain would want. 

4. A country with 1.5 billion people has environmental pressure- what happens? Migration. This is not a hard concept. Going south is unlikely- due to India and the increasing heat by the equator- so where do you go? North. Just makes the most sense. It's like when the Slavic tribes had to deal with the little ice again Europe- they went south into greener land. Makes sense. 

See previous. Rooting for a country dying just isn't going to end well, no matter who it is. A country with Nuclear weapons dying is probably the worst thing to happen in history. Rarely people here make those considerations. Nationalism is and always will be, a disease.

2. WW2 was indeed started by Germany. Here's the thing though, Germany went to such an extreme as nazism because of the treaty of Versailles and the great depression. The treaty of Versailles demanded that the Germans pay for pretty much all the damages from WW1. This was an absolutely ridiculous amount of debt that the germans could barely handle. And then the great depression hit which made everything even worse. The Germans rocketed into hyperinflation, you couldn't even buy a loaf of bread without an entire wheelbarrow of money.

And no a one party totalitarian state is Marxist Leninism, Marxist libertarianism or Trotskyism don't assume a single revolutionary vanguard party.

And no, these are Marxist and various other ideologies who seek to establish communism but are in fact socialist of some form. They have a set idea how to organize society in order to slowly transition into communism, but they are in no way organising a communist society. 

Again billionth time Nazis did get Lebensraum, they managed to ethnicly cleanse Germany and plenty of their occupied territories, they colonized Poland, Sudentenland, the Baltic States etc, unified Germans under one flag, Germany was self sufficient etc..

3827,"People who are saying ""Special Relationship gone""...

&amp;#x200B;

I really REALLY hate both countries governments far more than Trumps regime that frankly does very little except roll back as many Obama policies as possible. With that said, Russia and China do share a special relationship. Is it as strong as the UK/US one? No, few countries in the world have that level of a bond. I've seen it first hand in both countries as an outsider to both, it's real and it's deep even if the two can be bad for each other at times. 

There have been instances where I've seen the ""finally the 'special' relationship is over!"" comments on Reddit with minor incidents between the two countries yet here it still stands. If you think that this is somehow going to remotely hurt that special relationship between China and Russia you are absolutely out of your fucking mind. 

A few reminders..

&amp;#x200B;

* Belt and Road Initiative - Russia has sunk BILLIONS into it as has China (China far more than Russia even within Russias territory)
* Petrol/Oil - Do you have any clue how much money Russia gets from China by simply selling oil? China is boss, they always lowball Putin to way below prices they initially agreed upon with China setting terms for insanely long periods of time (China likes to have contracts in decades or even 99 years like many ports across the world from Chinese debt traps)
* China's OIL OIL OIL - Don't forget, China is worse than America when it comes to petrol. They use Russia as their bulldog in the Middle East while saving face. They are the #1 customer for countries like Iraq, not the US. 

Russia and China can play the whole ""we are equals, we love eachother"" but the reality is Russia has no choice in the matter. If Russia were to walk its own path without China, China would remind Russia which path Russia will go down by a friendly letter or force. 

I would agree though that the actual citizens of China and Russia don't respect eachother remotely the same I see Brits and Americans respect eachother. I'd say in the US, Americans have 100% respect for British people while in reverse I'd say Brits have closer to 70%, maybe during Obama years closer to 80% (I'm not refering to Gallups leadership approval btw..

3837,"&gt; Well, no. Denmark, Norway, Iceland and England are respectively Danish, Norwegian, Iceland and British/English nation states.

Denmark is a nation state for Danish.
its state religion is Christianity.
its national holidays are all Christian(Christmas, Easter, Ascension Day).
The flag has a cross on it that represents Christianity.

I don't know why you keep obsessing over the nation state law, its effects are purely symbolic and doesn't impair the rights of a single Arab-Israeli, it merely reiterated that Israel is a Jewish state, which has always been the case. But Please continue to find differences between Israel's constitution making it a Jewish state and Denmark's constitution making it a Christian state.

&gt; So I don't know why you're going with these examples. More important here is Israel's downgrading of Arabic. It is evidence for the supremacist logic employed in Knesset today, especially considering the rest of the legislation doing said downgrading as context.

Arabic still has a special status in Israel, you can speak Arabic in the Knesset, you can request government documents in Arabic, and road signs are translated into Arabic all over Israel.

b) The Arabic language has a special status in the state; the regulation of the Arab language in state institutions or when facing them will be regulated by law.
c) This clause does not change the status given to the Arabic language before the basic law was created.

3849,"Nuremberg was bombed pretty hard, especially on 2 January 1945. In the span of 30min 6000 bombs were dropped. Nuremberg Old Town was almost completely destroyed.
Nuremberg was among the most destroyed cities in Germany (mostly due to being the city of the „Reichsparteitage“ and heavy industry such as MAN).

After the war the city started reconstruction in 1955. The biggest reconstruction happened when they rebuild the 4km long city walls.
Today there is a weird mixture of different architectural styles such as a Jugendstil (Art Nouveau) next to gothic houses. Most of that was rebuilt after the war to give the impression of being old. Some parts were never rebuilt which is why you can see beautiful churches (e.g. Frauenkirche) next to very ugly buildings from the 60s and 70s. 

Even some bunkers still exist. There is a bunker underneath Nuremberg main railway station that was built during the war but later used as a shelter in case of a radioactive outfall during the cold war. Another one is used by the Germanisches National Museum (one of the biggest museums on Germany history) as a storage unit for paintings and stuff like that.

The old nazi ralley grounds also still exist.
-the Kongresshalle is used as a venue for orchestras in Nuremberg
-right next to is is the Große Straße which leads to the Volksfestplatz and the Nuremberg Comvention Centre
-the Volkspark Dutzendteich surrounds that area. This recreational area consists of several small lakes such as the Silbersee (which is contaminated DO NOT swim there, you will die) which was a construction site for the biggest stadium the world would’ve ever seen but got flooded with ground water when the war started
This area is used as the camping area for Rock Im Park festival, one of the biggest music festivals in Germany
-the Zeppelinfeld is where Hitler held his speaches, today its used as a festival and concert location (Rock Im Park and bands such as AC/DC) and American Football games 
-next to the Zeppelinfeld is a soccer/football stadium which is the home of 1. FC Nuremberg (currently 2. Bundesliga), it used to be the „Stadion der Hitlerjugend“ and was renamed to „Victory Stadium“ after the war
- and there is the infamous Burger King store which used to be a transformer building and you can still see the outline of the Reichsadler on the side of the building (https://www.tripadvisor.de/Restaurant_Review-g187310-d5519268-Reviews-Burger_King-Nuremberg_Middle_Franconia_Franconia_Bavaria.html)

&gt;how did the UK and precisely USA helped Poland during the WW2?

The UK and USA made sure that once WW2 was over, you had a country left to return to. Had the UK and USA not existed then Poland would've been wholly annexed by Russia. But you actually benefited from the war as although Stalin took your Eastern territories, you received rich, industrial German territories such as Breslau and Settin. The UK also hosted the Polish government in exile to preserve Polish legitimacy during the war. There were other things like allowing Polish military/pilots who had sought refuge in the UK to join the British Army but I won't get into that.

I don't know how effective Russia or China have been at modifying or building small yield nukes, but military people have mentioned it enough in the United States that it does seem like the taboo of using such weapons seems to be lessening by the decade. 

2. Robotic warfare is starting to be advanced. EMP weapons are more likely to be employeed, but Nukes solves both issues. 

3. Russia is losing population faster then its gaining and the russian military is rotting. If it wasn't for the software or propganda side of things, Russia would really be shit out of luck. 

4. Do not under estimate desertification. I can't find the growth in meters but its  2,250 miles of grassland per year into inhospitable wasteland. That is alot. If the government isn't concerned yet, they are insane. 

Like I said, 10 years ago I would have found the idea absurd, but the whole world is becoming increasingly destabilized by climate change, propaganda, mechanized warfare, and falling populations. If the American system that holds up the world economy falls, China isn't going to have the same sort of soft power either for that matter- and Russia is a key in destabilizing that system.

&gt;There was never deliberate Polonization like Russification or Germanization policies enforced by both states. Some assimilation occurred naturally but it was never a policy.



&gt;In 1923 and from 1925 to 1926 he was the Minister of Religious Beliefs and Public Education. In that time he further pursued nationalist policies, especially Polonization. He was the architect of the 1924 Lex Grabski, which de facto sought to eliminate the Ukrainian language from Polish schools.[5] These policies resulted in a dramatic increase in Ukrainian private schools and served to alienate Ukrainian youths from Polish authority.


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Grabski

His Party

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Democracy


Due the May 1926 it was changed back and Poland was tolerant, but it needed a coup and a not democratic government to stop the ND and their Polonization polices. 


&gt;and full scale genocide in the end

There was no full scale genocide. Go read about German occupation during WW2 and please read additionally the Polish government papers about it. The Polish jews were genocided, the Polish itself were faced with major planned resettlement, but minor done resettlement. Forced Labor mostly in prison in camps and subhuman treatment(but better than Soviets under German rule), were the most cause for Polish non Jewish deaths. Which were less than Polish Jewish deaths. To Generalplan Ost later.

&gt;Germans created whole ideology about Poles being subhumans,

correct.


&gt;destroyed most of Polish culture and traditions

false the stole a lot of culture objects and rarely destroyed them. They also denied higher education and cultural recreation like theaters, even though there were limited exemptions. 

To say they stole cultural goods and obstructed cultural means and tradition is less sharp, but the correct way. 



&gt;killed every educated Pole they could 

They did as first kill many of the intelligence, but it was more aimed and later that stopped as they needed educated Poles to run the system. As the Soviet did the same, but mainly to reason to hinder resistance from forming. The long term plans was in Nazi Germany to have no higher educated Poles, but how that would have played out is only guess work. 


&gt;and exterminated millions of men women and children with full intent to end Polish existence to ca 1952.


As Generalplan Ost you probably base your assumption was in the planning and was quite unclear. 1952 was quote as year were even Poles were left in Poland as peasants and slaves and would slowly die out due forbidden reproduction. There also numbers for Germanization and expulsion. 

I think a wikipedia link to Generalplan Ost, would be a better way to show how crazy the plans were instead of false summary. 


&gt;This is not something you can dismiss with “ups, sorry” thrown in passing. 


Now an opinion from my side.


General Plan Ost was secret and early implementation was met with resistance due various reason, mostly due prioritizing the war effort. I don't see how a secret plans made, by completely insane people is reason, but more the issue being done. I don't think Merkel should apologize for Himmlers hate on Lithuanians? 



&gt;Germany was not plundered or devastated after WWII nearly as Poland was.

that can't be really generalized, as borders were redrawn and areas did suffered differently. But of course the destruction of Poland was Germany fault and to some extent of the SU, while Germany caused it for itself. 


&gt;Germany was not plundered or devastated after WWII nearly as Poland was. Most of German companies, industrialists, businessmen survived and thrived after war even those who were participating actively in Nazi regime in wars and responsible for worst mass scale torture and murders. It’s good to remember that. 

It's good to remember, the later Generation of Germany did that, sadly the allies after the War and the German that were adult during the war, didn't want that.  The Movement of 68(student protest like all over the western world) were pressing for it for limited result. Now it's kind of too late. And some companies did make payments together with the German government for forced labor victims. 

In my opinion is now to late. The only people remembering the World War are 80 and above, 18 years old at the end of the war are now 93. Saying that a company or Person is guilty or should pay something is now to late.


&gt;You’re not personally responsible, we would be shooting each other otherwise


In my opinion personally most are not victim anymore. It's important to learn from history, but it's nothing somebody can claim for himself.


&gt;German state is and German corporations are.

In my opinion, I agree with the german state, as it's the collective of German people. 
Cooperation are more difficult as due time ownership changes as does it ethical behavior.


&gt;All in all it is what it is, you dismiss Polish grievances and losses as irrelevant


Now I'm going to rant.
He pointed out that playing it's your personal grievance is stupid. Also taking history always as face value is reddit favorite hobby, but is incredibly dumb. People should look at reasons, why things happened and not attribute behavior no nations states or ethnic people. 

Your previous comment triggered me most.  Your either a Polish fascist and racist or historical ignorant and dumb. 


&gt;Nazi Germany continued anti Polish polices of Imperial Germany

Imperial Germany had different policies and during a different time frame and different extent. Some were not exclusive against Polish, but against other minorities and had the intent of Germanisation. 

The Nazi has total mad and crazy ideas like we already discussed. 

&gt;which continued the same polices of Prussia etc

Prussia itself was like Imperial Germany had Germanisation as intent and was also very different as were even during the time frame.

And what ETC? Explain which continuation?



&gt;we could go on to Saxon Eastern March and HRE.

Oh yes please. Tell us HRE and Poland gang up to split Elb slavs between them, that's a nice story of Polish being oppressed.  Or do mean the short conflict over the together conquered territory after succession on the HRE side and Polish returning territory later to the HRE. That oppression of non Polish slavs is really going hard here. Do you want to add the Wendish Crusade or the Northern Crusades overall that mostly saw German and Poles ganging on other slavs and balts. 


&gt;Changing name or flag doesn’t change your history, culture, character or attitudes. 

Ignoring history, making dumb assumption makes you a racist asshole. tell me the German history before 1871. And the culture, even today it's hard to speak of a unified German culture, but maybe you know more then me. And the German character and attitude, as we are a clone army.

3947,"For a bit of context here - this is a direct result of ‘affaire Mila’ where a 16-year old girl called Mila had to be taken away from school and given police protection for criticising Islam online. Regardless of your opinion on the matter please note that France doesn’t have blasphemy laws, in fact white to opposite - criticising religion (but not believers) is seen as a right and heritage of the French Revolution. Laïcité is often quoted as unofficial fourth value of France next to Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité. Some of the ministers commenting on the matter have been criticised in the media for basically doing ‘whataboutism’ - ‘what happened to the girl was wrong, but she kinda brought it out for herself’. This didn’t sit well with a lot of French.
Another thing is the Muslim population in France - their parents and great parents came in during the 50s when France still had a colonial empire in Africa and needed cheap labour. The 1950s-1970s are called here ‘30 Glorious Years’ due to post war reconstruction and economic growth. After all was set and done people didn’t go back to their home countries and stayed in France (surprise!).
Complicating the matter is the fact that second and third generation coming from abroad do not have the same job opportunities as ethnically French - this is clearly seen when you see the names of people driving you in Uber, delivering food for UberEats, Deliveroo, etc.
So in the end you have quite a dichotomy - on the one hand the official line is ‘we are all French’ (in fact the concept of being French is related to nationality, not ethnic origin - this was seen where Trevor Noah from The Daily Show got in trouble from saying ‘Africa won France a world rugby championship’, in the mind of French republicans those players are as French as everyone else), on the other hand people can see clearly some opportunities are different depending on the colour of your skin and your family history. And as is often the case when people feel disgruntled and frustrated they mostly retreat to their cultural groups and take solace in religion and cultural ties. This is often the case where second and third generation immigrants are more religious than their grandparents.

&gt;maybe even the role of women in the Church

If you’re suggesting the ordination of women, that will never happen. It’s not even because the pope might not want to, but it’s impossible for women to be ordained. Saint Pope John Paul II has affirmed this in [*Ordinatio Sacerdotalis*](http://www.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/apost_letters/1994/documents/hf_jp-ii_apl_19940522_ordinatio-sacerdotalis.html) and Pope Francis I has reaffirmed it.

&gt;There are still many young Catholics, even if the trend is irrelegiousness, that could engross the ranks of the Church, but only a fraction will do to its restrictions.

The trend has become that the remaining Catholics (especially the younger ones) are now leaning towards traditionalism. It’s why things like the Latin mass are becoming popular again.",Poland,/r/europe/comments/f608c7/one_in_four_new_catholic_priests_in_europe_is/fi2hq89/,gepoa,1582080032

To satisfy the need for Mosque imams, France (currently) welcomes ""Imams détachés"", originating from other countries and financed by them, in the framework of bilateral accords. There are around 300 permanents, including 150 originating from Turkey, 120 from algeria, and around 30 from Morroco;  the main countries of origin of 4 to 5 million Muslims in France. These Imams form a small part of the

4125,"&gt; Could you tell me those countries which had severe aging population and had high interest rates?

Iceland was over 10% just several years ago. The Eurozone was a 4% (which is still really high compared to nowadays) before the crisis, Australia was 7% before the crisis while Denmark was 6%. South Korea was around there too and of course all the Eastern European countries I mentioned had very high interest rates despite more severe aging than the West.   

&gt;Old people being savers is well documented and its part of every Samuelson textbook for students,   


I don't disagree, I'm saying I see no reason or proof to think that alone can dictate interest rates. And all the examples above show that  it can't.  

&gt;India has more potential growth than USA. Why? Well its pretty simple, there are already technologies in the world that are widely used but are not adopted there. If they are gonna realize that growth that is another thing.  


Like I said there's two kind of ""potentials"". One is an anything's possible kind and the other is when a country currently has the fundamentals to grow strongly.  Having available technologies is not enough if you're not going to implement them. Madagascar is 100 times poorer than Austria but it won't be catching up any time soon despite all the available technologies. Because it doesn't have the fundamentals to make use of them. The potential is only theoretical.   




&gt;Anyway, if you need an a actual paper here it is:https://www.jstor.org/stable/2487097?seq=1 And its finding:   

I'm not gonna pay 20 dollars and read 190 pages to confirm what you said.  Your quote doesn't back your figures. It's not really important whether they're 80 or 40% but if you insist on them then provide a useful  source. 

&gt;The situation of Japan is very interesting but its definetly not as bad as people say. 

Debatable. 

&gt;Their gdp per capita growth is in line with the west,  

In purchasing power maybe but  Japan's total GDP still hasn't recovered   [**from the 90s**](https://assets.weforum.org/editor/large_i2_idkY11a7LgexnPDCv1pmhGlVUFZlM01RUnnohh7c.png). I would also argue Japan *should* have done much better than Western Europe or the US. Their whole region has been on fire with economic growth. From South Korea's meteoric rise to a developed country to China's insane growth to the whole region of South East Asia which has been growing 5% yearly. Japan should have benefited greatly from the growth of their neighbours. Also Japan should be growing faster because it really isn't as rich as people assume. Its GDP PPP per capita is below average for Western Europe. Its productivity is lower than Spain's and  I think that estimate doesn't even account for the unofficial overtime they do.  Japan may have avoided a Greek style recession but IMO they are way behind where they should be and that might be because of their debt mountain.    


&gt;they pay less interest on their debt than Germans or Americans. 

Uh, I've read the opposite, 25% of Japan's budget goes to debt servicing. Maybe the interest rate is lower but there's still enough debt to wreck their budget.

&gt;Their debt is really stable.  

It has been growing slowly in recent years. You might think well at least it's slow but these are the times when Japan's unemployment has been super low. This is the prime time to reduce the debt ratio. If you can't do it while record % of people have work and pay taxes then you certainly won't be able to do it when they're unemployed and need benefits. Japan's debt ratio will continue to grow slowly and then it will jump next crisis.",Bulgaria,/r/europe/comments/f5qf6j/euro_zone_germany_back_fiscal_boost_in_the_event/fi21bo8/,ZmeiOtPirin,1582069225

4152,"Yes I’m denying it because it’s simplistic nonsense. What, if I go blow up a concert or run down a bunch of people celebrating Christmas, I get to blame the Versailles treaty or WW2 for a legacy of violence? No, I’m the one to blame because I committed the violence. Incidentally the same applies to far-right morons that kill, injure or abuse people because of their political views. This isn’t to pick on Muslims alone, but they are the subject of this diatribe.

My take on why young Muslim men get radicalized is because our “multi-cultural” societies have failed. To be more honest, they never took off to begin with. Europe is a place of ethno-states, and inviting a people that talk differently, look differently and pray differently into such countries and then glossing over it all by forcing “multi-culturalism” is bound to create problems.

1st gen Muslim immigrants kept their heads down, worked and consoled themselves with a better standard of living in exchange for having to live in a strange land. 2nd gen finds themselves in limbo, not accepted in their homeland because they’re not Germans, Austrians or Englishmen (because those are ethnic identities, not civil-nationalist like our elite would have us believe) and not belonging in their parents homeland because they were born abroad.

Add to that the cultural churn of living in a globalized society where all traditions, not just Islamic, are being eroded and you get a recipe for listless young men with no sense of belonging and a heightened sense of their “own” (really their parents) culture slipping away. That’s why they flock to hard-core extremist outfits like Daesh. And of course racism certainly doesn’t help, but it’s far from the leading cause. It’s just the easiest way to explain a highly complicated phenomenon. And if you’re wondering why this sounds familiar, it might be because a similar process is funnel people towards the far-right, and even extreme left protest groups.

We are all in our own way grasping for an identity and a place to belong, and in a society with rapid economic, cultural and technological change many people are unable to find their footing without at least being tempted by extremist movements that provide simplistic answers (Islamic fundamentalism, far-right ethno-nationalism or left wing eco-extremism).",,/r/europe/comments/f5ty1v/twelve_men_arrested_in_police_raids_last_week_are/fi224pp/,EuroDemos,1582069743

My uneducated view is that the current protests by farmers are putting some pressure on the current coalition to show any sign of alignment with their demands. Making a bit of a ruckus could be just another political play to appease them.

Thus any unit of human labor put into operating the machine produce a amplified amount out without it coming out of some stored pool.

Then again, i have seen people take the labor theory of value further back and looking at the ultimate source of energy, land. Often by referencing the forerunners of the likes of Marx and Smith, the physiocrats.

Only by looking at it in a more modern sense by looking at energy rather than labor. This in that the ultimate energy source is the sun, and for much of human life that has been captured via farming.

If you're referring to 2015's ""26%"" growth rate, 17 percentage points of that comes from ONE aircraft leasing company re-basing it's stock of aircraft in Ireland. Low profit, high revenue, measured against a small economy gives you your anomaly, and very little to tax since corp. tax is levied against profits, not revenue.  So then you have to account for 9% growth. The domestic economy (GNP) grew by 8% that year. 

How much is left to attribute to ""multinationals switching their domiciles around""? Not very much.

How many headlines did we have ignorantly proclaiming ""tax haven"" nonsense? A FUCKLOAD. If the same amount of revenue moved to the UK or Germany, it would have accounted for about 1% or less growth, but nobody writes headlines about that. Capital has no limit on where it can move, and doesn't care if there's a small population, but it's movements can show larger swings measured against smaller countries. That doesn't mean those movements are illegitimate.

Why do Brits always think they're experts on the Irish economy? More to the point, why do Brits always bring up the ""tax haven"" thing, when [the UK is the world's leading tax shelter by far.](https://topdocumentaryfilms.com/spider-web-britain-second-empire/)

The fact that behaviour analysis is an integral point of market-studies? Do you genuinely believe product placement profileferation would be one of the main concerns and avenues of expense if people were to act in a purely rational fashion.

Leaving aside that Marxian and by extension socialist economics get criticised for the LTV as exposed by Riccardo and not the social component Marx exposed (difference between the subject of study being an individual in a specific environment and social behaviour at large, i.e. the dichotomy between exchange value and use value), we are not throwing out netownian physics because they fail to account for quantum physics; much the same we don't throw away Riccardian liberalism because of the LTV, or Marxian anaysis because of the LTV, instead of building on *and expanding* in the areas they are insufficient.

4295,"&gt; Sooner or later they will require to be hospitalized, their health will deteriorate, and they will die.

Can't be bothered but... basically no. Hospitalization is only required when issue becomes acute enough concentrated specialized medical care is necessary. There are many steps before we actually get to that point, and with proper prevention most patients won't need this kind of care. They will die, sure, but to chronic diseases that are easily treated in long-term care facilities or on outpatient basis.

&gt;You already have lack of hospital beds even here and there are months long waiting lines for certain surgeries.

If that's your concern... well, I can't speak for Czech Republic (which is in much better situation looking at stats) but in Poland queues have nothing to do with beds (at least not hospital ones), especially when it comes to surgical procedures. Bottleneck is either in money or specialized workforce: we only have so many specialists that can attend the patient, or we're only paid to deal with as many patients. 

It manifest a bit differently depending on exactly what specialization we're talking about, but for example when it comes to orthopedic surgeries the brutal truth is hospital has contract for - say - 200 hip replacements per year. Nobody will get paid for 201st, so patient is bumped till next year. Meanwhile the same team can do the same procedure next week in private hospital because ... hey, it's not like they have anything better to do (anesthesiologist probably does, but they basically live in hospitals already anyways).

The other option is lack of workforce. Say you need endocrinologist consultation. Great - there are four total servicing metro area of 1 mln people where I work. There's money to employ more specialists, but it's not like you can get people that are qualified out of thin air. So as far as current situation goes, good luck I guess? Because those people that do work will try to go through as many people as they can... and you know what will suffer? Quality.

We have so severe staffing issues a lot of wards (and hospitals by extension...), including major teaching hospitals, are one sudden illness or retirement from collapsing and being forced to simply close. Even now half of the reason I have so much time writing on bloody reddit is because recently I had 3 night shifts per week on average, because after government introduced e-prescriptions we lost couple older physicians who simply couldn't be arsed dealing with this bullshit and retired. We're already pressing in people who just started their specialization in semi-illegal way too. We're starting to have issues in education too - I currently work at 3 Universities just because I got begged to cover classes in my field simply because nobody else wanted to do it (and I don't blame them: I don't want to either, I barely get enough money to cover commute... someone has to do it though).

The example I've given by the way - 2 physicians for I think it's 48 beds was real life one. One of those physicians by the way JUST finished her specialization, and other one in her 70s. They just hired 3rd specialist after quadrupling hourly rate. That person was poached from teaching hospital from nearby major city, which caused that hospital to have issues covering their highest-tier emergency minimum staffing. They in turn poached someone from half across the country, but I'm pretty sure it in turn caused issues there. It will continue like that until people crack and allow for 'double shifts' - basically one physician covering two spots at the same time. 

Anyways, do you think increasing number of beds will change anything here? After certain point beds are buffer. They enable longer and less efficient diagnosis and treatment, plus in many cases replace what should be hospice care, other long-term care facilities or simply releasing patient back home. Which by the way leads to another funny story: people literally stash their elder in hospitals. I've seen it countless times: confused, dehydrated elderly person is admitted (as it should). You resume therapy as in documentation, let that person drink and eat, sleep overnight and there's no reason to keep that patient anymore. Except because of broadly put dementia that person cannot be on their own, and is normally in care of family that suddenly is out of reach for couple weeks. So that patient is stuck in hospital for weeks, we can't release the patient to family, and we can't send it anywhere else because no other ward is stupid enough to take that patient ... and there's not enough ... lets call it nursing homes (it's broader category but I'm too tired to find more accurate translations). Same story with mental disorders by the way. That's where we lack beds: hospices, nursing homes etc., plus simply social workers: for majority of those people it would literally be enough for someone to come by everyday and help them with daily life. Instead they end up in hospitals, and because nobody can actually look at them they clog already screwed system.",Poland,/r/europe/comments/f5ofyq/number_of_inhabitants_per_available_beds_in/fi1qvkt/,Fresherty,1582062995

4339,"Pol Pot was more-severe, but Mao's [Cultural Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Revolution) was larger and also included anti-intellectual components.

Mao's power base was with the rural peasantry -- back during the [Chinese Communist Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Communist_Revolution), he was the guy who drove the ""rural"" side of things.  Under Soviet thought, where the October Revolution had been driven by urban workers, the important thing was the urban side of things; as Soviet influence and support played a role in the Chinese communist revolution, Mao wasn't initially as-important a figure.

But in China, it turned out that the nationalist forces wound up holding the cities, and the communist forces were strong in the country.  So Mao wound up becoming a critical figure and ultimately the head honcho in communist China.  After he'd screwed up in some pretty high-visibility ways, he was worried about political opposition, and kicked off the Cultural Revolution to purge opposition.  One element was anti-urban and anti-intellectual:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_to_the_Countryside_Movement

&gt; The Up to the Mountains and Down to the Countryside Movement, often known simply as the Down to the Countryside Movement, was a policy instituted in the People's Republic of China in the late 1960s and early 1970s. As a result of what he perceived to be pro-bourgeois thinking prevalent during the Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao Zedong declared certain privileged urban youth would be sent to mountainous areas or farming villages to learn from the workers and farmers there. In total, approximately 17 million youth were sent to rural areas as a result of the movement.[1]
&gt;
&gt;Chairman Mao's policy differed from Chinese President Liu Shaoqi's early 1960s sending-down policy in its political context. President Liu Shaoqi instituted the first sending-down policy to redistribute excess urban population following the Great Chinese Famine and the Great Leap Forward. Mao's stated aim for the policy was to ensure that urban students could ""develop their talents to the full"" through education amongst the rural population.[2]
&gt;
&gt;Many fresh high school graduates, who became known as the so-called sent-down youth (also known in China as ""educated youth"" and abroad as ""rusticated youth""), were forced out of the cities and effectively exiled to remote areas of China. Some commentators consider these people, many of whom lost the opportunity to attend university, China's ""lost generation"". 

-

&gt;From December 1968 onward, millions of educated urban youth, consisting of secondary school graduates and students, were mobilized and sent ""up to the mountains and down to the villages"" i.e. to rural villages and to frontier settlements.

4346,"Muhammad's youngest and only virgin wife is Aisha (Aysha or Ayesha), the daughter of his closest companion. Her age at the time of marriage is uncertain. According to some narrations, she was 9 years old. Because she could have been as young as 9 years old, these days, some haters of Islam today say that Prophet Mohammad (pbuh) was a pedophile. However, according to alternative methods of calculating her age, she could have been 12 – 18 years old. What is certain is that he did reach her puberty and she was very happy in her marriage.
Most of the Hadith narrations mentioning her age was nine are reported through Hisham ibn Urwa while living in Iraq, where Hisham ibn Urwa is reported to have relocated after living in Madinah for seventy-one years. It is reported in one of the most well known books on the life and reliability of the narrators of the traditions ascribed to the Muhammad reports that Yaqub ibn Shaibah said, “narratives reported by Hisham are reliable except those that are reported through the people of Iraq”. It further states that Malik ibn Anas objected on those narratives of Hisham, which were reported through people of Iraq. Another book on the narrators of the traditions of the Muhammad reports that when he was old, Hisham’s memory suffered quite badly.
We find evidence in both Hadith books and history books that indicates Aisha must have been older than nine when she got married:

• According to a hadith in Bukhari and Muslim, Aisha is said to have joined Muhammad on the raid that culminated in the Battle of Badr, in 624 CE. However, because no one below the age of fifteen was allowed to accompany raiding parties, Aisha should have been at least fifteen in 624 CE and thus at least thirteen when she was married following the Hijra in 622 CE.

• Ibn Hisham’s version of Ibn Ishaq’s Sirat Rashul Allah, the earliest surviving biography of Muhammad, records Aisha as having converted to Islam before Umar ibn al-Khattab, during the first few years of Islam around 610 CE. In order to accept Islam she must have been walking and talking, hence at least three years of age, which would make her at least fifteen in 622 CE.

• Tabari reports that Abu Bakr wished to spare Aisha the discomforts of a journey to Ethiopia soon after 615 CE, and tried to bring forward her marriage to Mut`am’s son. Mut`am refused because Abu Bakr had converted to Islam, but if Aisha was already of marriageable age in 615 CE, she must have been older than nine in 622 CE.

• Tabari also reports that Abu Bakr’s four children were all born during the Jahiliyyah (Pre-Islam Period), which has ended in 610 CE, making Aisha at least twelve in 622 CE.

• According to Ibn Hajar, Fatima was five years older than Aisha. Fatima is reported to have been born when Muhammad was thirty-five years old, meaning Aisha was born when he was forty years old, and thus twelve when Muhammad married at fifty-two.

 

• According to the generally accepted tradition, Aisha was born about eight years before Hijrah (Migration to Medina). However, according to another narrative in Bukhari (Kitaab al-Tafseer) Aisha is reported to have said that at the time Surah Al-Qamar, the 54th chapter of the Qur’an , was revealed, “I was a young girl”. The 54th Surah of the Qur’an was revealed nine years before Hijrah. According to this tradition, Aisha had not only been born before the revelation of the referred Surah, but was actually a young girl, not even only an infant at that time. So if this age is assumed to be 7 to 14 years, then her age at the time of marriage would be 14 to 21.

• According to almost all the historians, Asma the elder sister of Aisha, was ten years older than Aisha. It is reported in Taqreeb al-Tehzeeb as well as in Ibn Kathir's Al-Bidayah wa al-Nihayah that Asma died in the 73rd year after migration of Muhammad when she was 100 years old. Now, obviously if Asma was 100 years old in the 73rd year after Migration to Medina, she should have been 27 or 28 years old at the time of migration. If Asma was 27 or 28 years old at the time of hijrah, Aisha should have been 17 or 18 years old at that time. Thus, if Aisha got married in year 1 AH or 2 AH (after Migration to Medina), she must have been between 18 to 20 years old at the time of her marriage.

• According to many Ahadith in Bukhari, it is believed Aisha participated in the both of Badr and Uhud battles. Furthermore, in Bukhari's Kitabu’l-Maghazi, Ibn `Umar states: ""The Prophet did not permit me to participate in Uhud battle, as at that time, I was 14 years old. But on the day of Khandaq battle, when I was 15 years old, the Prophet permitted my participation"". So, since it was not allowed for Muslims younger than 15 years old to participate in Uhud battle, Aisha, who participated in Uhud, must have been at least 15 years old in those battles; thus her age was at least 13 to 14 at the time of her marriage.

• According to ibn Sa’d's Tabaqat and Ansab al-Ashraf books, opinions are in disagreement concerning her marriage with Muhammad. The marriage seems to have taken place either two of five years after the Migration (Usd al-Ghaba, 5:501).",,/r/europe/comments/f5rqj0/sadiq_khan_urges_eu_to_offer_britons_associate/fi1ckjo/,akunke5yanglaindiban,1582055048

Because they are seamlessly integrated, and don't consider themselves any different, because they aren't treated any differently.

This lie that the Republic is anti-protestant or anti-secular is such nonsense. As if there was a mirroring with the apartheid state in the North. There wasn't. Sectarianism has always been overwhelmingly one-way (you could be protestant and in the IRA, but you can't be Catholic and join the orange order), and supported by one state, the UK.

&gt;There are versions of communism where the state simply purchases businesses and grants ownership to the workers. 

1. Where the state gets money to pay owners from?

2. What if owners don't want to sell?

&gt;
Even if the owner doesn't sell, market forces (of all things) would drive workers to go somewhere else, where they get full value for their labour.

Worker-owned businesses are already possible in capitalism as well. Somehow, most workers are perfectly content outside of this model.

No? Besides Russia is not going to fight one on one, it will be 29 nations including sole superpower- USA versus Russia that has economy size of Spain. Russia is over glorified state. 

&gt;But even if it was true, so what? It only means that that less NATO troops would be a credible threat to Russia, which means there is an increased risk of escalation sooner. 

There will never be threat to Russia from NATO side. It's Russia who is threat to NATO countries.

&gt;I meant in active service. The reserves are also a mix of professionals and conscripts.

You gonna need to prove that. I won't take your word for it.

&gt;But there are no indications that the Russians doubt the American commitment to your security, even with no significant number of troops deployed.

Imaging believing what Russia says.

&gt;I don't think so, but okay. 

Yes you would.

&gt;An elementary school level comeback. 

That wasn't a comeback, you did agree me and I thanked you for understanding or are going to start editing your comment to try to hide it? 

&gt;Again, no. The only thing that would actually prove commitment are their actions in case hostilities break out.

American soldiers training with Lithuanian soldiers is the proof of commitment whether you like it or not. No level of denial will ever change that.

&gt;But you're saying more is better, and that there should only be increases. If Americans deployed 20 thousand troops in Lithuania, which is something you'd presumably support, how many do you think the Russians would deploy on their side of the border?

As many as they can, whilst I laugh at them for pouring last drop of rubles towards nothingness.

&gt;But how is it possible that you don't understand that threat perception leads to more deployments, which leads to greater threat perception and so on? 

How can you not understand that Russia is in no state to compete with American? Russia is a dirt poor country.

&gt;Either the Americans stop deploying at some point and let Russia keep roughly the same level of local superiority that they now enjoy, or they keep deploying and deploying until they match the Russian forces which then increases Russia's perception of a threat to themselves, which leads to more unpredictability. 

That's the thing, I want Russian ""superiority"" gone. Since I know that we - Lithuanians have America on our side, Russia is in not state to be capable of competing with it unless it would want to go full bankrupt while people start eating each other.

&gt;You're unable to actually articulate why this is your point of view, probably because you're not thinking rationally. 

Neither is you. Since you can't rationalise that Russia was and will always be a dirt poor country with inability to compete with the West.

4486,"Why is there no shortage of beds in hotels rather than beds in hospitals ? Because one is motivated by profit to accommodate as many people as they can as it brings them money.

Patient in hospital is an enemy. Because he drains budget of hospital.

The reason for this mainly comes from Friedman. There are 4 modes of spending money ranked from the most efficient to least:

1. Your money on your own things. This is your personal budget. You are the most efficient with it because you know what you want and you count money constantly, think about spending money differently on alternatives and so on.

2. Your money on not your own things. This is you when you lend money to your friends. You still know them and have some logic if they are trustworthy or not and you count money well. You still can get shafted but you at least have some proper calculation.

3. Not your money on your own things. This is your company credit card situation when you are on work related visit to trade partner. You still make best decisions for yourself but you don't count money well since company pays for it.

4. Not your money on not your own things. This is you working in government. You spend money on things that are not related to you with money that you don't own which means you don't really care much if it is spend efficiently, especially since you don't have even ability to tell on ground what is the most efficient way.

As you can see perfectly from those modes of spending. Any public good is destined to fail in inefficiency wasting taxpayers money. They only way for taxpayers to get best healthcare is when they are the one deciding what is best for them.",,/r/europe/comments/f5ofyq/number_of_inhabitants_per_available_beds_in/fi10ski/,perkelwashere,1582048415

Frankly, the ones who are straight up evil i believe will much more often be overthrown, like the Nazis were, while the people who just continues to kill people primarily by malpractice, but also due to jailing and executing dissidents tend to be given the benefit of the doubt.

4651,"Honestly, it's literally meaningless stat. In perfect scenario you want to limit patient's stay in hospital to zero (or as close as possible to), and it's not just because of costs ('hotel' part of hospital is quite expensive), but mainly because it's just better from purely medical perspective. 

For once you don't want patient to even get to the point he needs hospitalization - prevention when available is pretty much always the best route. If patient needs surgical intervention, you want him out of the hospital as soon as possible: hospital-acquired infections are huge issue. In case of elderly even simple fact you're drastically changing environment from house to hospital can create serious mental health issues.

Not to mention simple number of beds doesn't tell us anything about quality of care: the fact you're physically in hospital doesn't mean you're getting equal attention from personnel. In Poland it's not unheard of to have as little as 2 physicians per 40-50 beds for example because requirements are set on ""per ward"" basis, not ""per patient"". The latter is actually the other part of the story: wards tend to have inflated number of beds. That's because number of nurses is usually set on ""per bed"" basis, hence tendency to have 'official' number that basically counts maximum capacity with every single room filled to the brim, as well as all corridors filled with beds. That 40-50 bed ward in 'normal operation' might have 'just' 30.",Poland,/r/europe/comments/f5ofyq/number_of_inhabitants_per_available_beds_in/fi0c55u/,Fresherty,1582033207

Yeah the Israeli electorate has understood that Land for Peace does not work with the Palestinians.  
Sucks for the Palestinians.

Oh and why did you ignore the part about Abbas?

&gt; Wrong because all of the West Bank, Areas A, B, C are not sovereign territory. Ownership of the land is to be decided by mutual agreement between Israel and Palestine, by expanding its settlements Israel is expanding the territory within the West Bank that it cannot give to a future Palestinian state except at tremendous cost.

And since Israel is not taking the territory all is well.  
After all settlements can and have been evacuated.

&gt; Do you think that if someone doesn't have a piece of paper that says they own a bit of land that just anyone can take it? 

Well considering how that part of the world has been using that system for longer than we in Europe have this is quite the awkward question.

I mean it's literally their system.

&gt; So all those settlements do exist including the new ones created after the Oslo Accords which are on land everyone knows Israel will never give up because its inhabited by its own citizens. I mean do you seriously believe they'll evacuate tens of thousands of Israelis to secure peace?

Homeowners have an incentive to improve their energy efficiency, but in my experience in rental properties without inclusive bills there is no attempt to improve this; landlords don't want to shell out the cash because they're not paying the inflated energy bills.

It would be a good move to require rented properties to conform to a higher EPC rating, such as D or C. 

Currently landlords must meet an E rating, which as far as I can tell basically involves fitting a couple of LED bulbs and putting in double glazing in *some* rooms, or getting a combi boiler made in the last decade.

My Landlord's property just got assessed as C because we (as tenants) replaced the filament light bulbs and bought our own thermostat, but aside from this there is no cavity wall insulation or loft insulation whatsoever, despite this being a job that would only cost a few hundred quid.

So you are assuming no ongoing security situation in NI?

NI has the highest level of public spending in the UK. It has by far the largest deficit in the UK. If you are looking at a historical, rather than population share of debt, NI's would be astronomical.

The idea that the UK is going to pay for NI to join the Republic is ridiculous. It would be a political impossibility to ask UK taxpayers to fund NI debt and pensions.

So your argument will be vote for unification and we'll cut jobs and services? Not sure that will persuade many people.

If you don't want council services, the NHS etc, certainly. But I suspect the people of NI do want those things.

It doesn't work like that. Unfunded pensions are paid by the departments people worked for. So a doctor who worked in NI has his pension paid by the NI NHS. If NI joined the Republic, taxes in NI would have to fund the NI NHS, because the UK government would no longer be transferring money to NI to pay for public services.

Absolutely fair enough. The UK really should not be in a position to cherry pick from a closer relationship with the EU. 

However....now the narrative has switched entirely, with the EU appearing to take the position that any relationship with the UK other than WTO arrangements, where the UK is not a rule taker, does in itself constitute cherry picking. 

I've seen a few weak justifications for this. Geographical proximity and dumping(?.

I find the argument of geographical proximity somewhat dishonest though and the argument that the UK, with a rather large trading deficit with the EU might start ""dumping"" goods on the EU to be laughable.

5251,"The only necessary qualifications for an aircraft to operate in this manner are computational power and maybe directional wireless transmission. The former of which can be done on any old airframe, and the latter is already a part of the F-35.

Issuing orders to drones was always part of the F-35 roadmap but never more than one or two strike (ground attack) aircraft flying alongside was ever really demmed logical as any drone capible of matching the distance and speed of the manned jet is going to have to be of a comparable size unless it's carried by the jet and deployed when needed.

Any ""drone"" deployed by this hypothetical aircraft isn't going to realistically be recovered so your effectively talking about an advanced missile if used for AA purposes.

Regardless of whether you call them drones or missiles, they would be a much higher development priority than the aircraft itself. It's only in the last couple years we've seen prototypes of the wingman drones the F-35 and others might end up flying with.

The fact we haven't seen any indication of what they're supposed to be just makes it seem like a marketing pitch for what is essentially another 5th gen air frame of the same basic pattern we've seen since the F-22.

5289,"After three years of drama, on midnight Jan 31 the Brits finally left the European Union. The next piece of the Brexit drama will be a decidedly non-European affair, instead being between a [family debate](https://zeihan.com/the-cutting-room-files-part-5-the-future-of-the-united-kingdom/) between London and Washington.  
 

Which leaves it to the European Union – now with 27 members – to attend to its own drama.  
 

When discussing the challenges facing the European Union it is…difficult to know where to begin.  
 

I guess it makes the most sense to start at the top. The European common currency – the euro – is a spectacular achievement, but unfortunately it was insufficient to the needs of binding Europe together economically. Because the union has no complimentary tax or banking regime, each country follows its own economic strategies. In most circumstances, the currency cannot adapt to changing economic norms, while for their part the various eurozone members lack the tools to fine-tune their systems with monetary tools.  
 

In simple terms, at any given time some eurozone members are growing gangbusters and for-them-too-low eurowide interest rates spur overheating, inflation and asset bubbles, while others are in recession and for-them-too-high interest rates make growth impossible. On both sides eurozone members are left to experiment with less-than-fully-safe tax and banking policies which generate their own bubbles, recessions and distortions. Twenty years on, the much ballyhooded macroeconomic alignment the euro was supposed to bring about is *further* away than ever.  
 

This has blown up most spectacularly in Greece. Thirteen years on on from Greece’s debt blowup, the country is still on the hook for over 339 billion euros in state debt, or 185% of GDP. A few horrific points of comparison:  
 

* In relative terms, this is roughly *double* the relative American debt load.
* The *total* EU annual budget is just under 170 billion euros. The Greek economy is less than 2% of the total EU economy.
* Nearly all of this debt has been offloaded by financiers, and is now directly held by European institutions or supported by EU payouts. In effect, the entire country is in receivership.
* Under the best-case scenario assuming no funding crunches, no problems with the euro and no recessions in Greece or Europe, this receivership will run for decades. The European Commission does not expect Greece’s debt to drop below 100% of GDP until 20*48*.

It’s worse than it sounds. The EU’s selective and partial integration enables EU citizens to change residency (and to a degree, citizenship) with ease, so the top 5% of Greeks as regards wealth and educational standards shifted legal status, while less-rich Greeks have kept their legal status to maintain access to Greek transfer payments, but physically relocated to avoid Greek taxes. Greek politics are too complicated to call merely Byzantine, and for the most part have simply collapsed into a Greek tragedy.  
 

Greece will *never* recover. Greece’s agricultural, energy, financial and industrial sectors are for all practical purposes, gone. Greece only continues as a state because the EU shells out money for it to exist. This is the price that must be paid for the euro to have any international credibility whatsoever.  
 

As big as a problem as Greece has become, it is peanuts compared to Europe’s banking problems. While not nearly as bad as what passes for banking in China, in the EU banking is a de facto arm of state policy, with loans on preferential terms regularly being handed out to achieve this or that (un)official state goal.  
 

In many cases there is at least something sane in mind, such as boosting economic activity or expanding infrastructure. Sometimes sanity gets stretched, such as when EU member states throw money to failing companies or help finance expansion into markets – whether geographic or product type – they probably should have stayed out of. And sometimes the loans simply go to purely political, even partisan, activities. Spin down to the regional and local levels and regional and local banks are regularly used by regional and local politicians of all stripes as personal slush funds.  
 

While the details differ from country by country and year to year, it adds up to a banking sector so moribund, so overexposed to unrecoverable risk that EU’s sector-wide assessments of banking health suggest that if the top 300ish EU banks were located in the United States, that the FDIC would have closed down *all of them*.  
 

The Europeans are notoriously squirrely about the specific numbers behind their banking crisis, using myriad statistical models and definitions as to what actually comprises a “bad loan” to make things look less dire than they are. But pretty much everyone with a pulse agrees that by far the worst of the problems are in Italy. Semi-officially, even with over a decade of debt write downs and government funds injections, Italy still holds about half of the total stock of bad loans of the entire eurozone. Officially, the figure peaked – using Italian numbers and definitions – at 360 billion euro in 2016. The real figure, is undoubtedly higher. Double? Triple? More? (My bet is on more, especially if you use American definitions and thresholds.)  
 

Remember, the more local the bank, the more likely local politicians are to tap them for personal needs, and the mafia are quintessentially *local* “politicians.” For comparison, the U.S. subprime real estate market during the 2007-2009 crisis generated bad debt worth $600 billion – a figure that was remediated considerably by the liquidation of housing stock that backed all the bad debt – for an economy seven times as large. Even if you believe completely the Italian data (and, HA!) that makes Italy’s debt crisis at least triple that of US subprime. Use US definitions and we’re easily talking an order-of-magnitude higher.  
 

At its core, many of Europe’s chronic problems come down to competitiveness. For all their vaunted educational systems, Europeans have a devil of a time translating high learning into high skills that generate economic activity. In part it is a legal system that strongly favors the old or employed over the young or unemployed. In part it’s an overly-burdened, overly-generous pension system that is a (the?) leading source of the political system’s legitimacy for the middle class. In part it is a tangled thicket of multi-level regulatory burdens. In part it is statism. In part it is protectionism. In part it is a rigormortized labor market. In part it’s an economic system that discriminates against new economic sectors in favor of state support for the largest players of old industries.

5293,"The competitiveness issue isn’t simply between Europe and the rest of the world, but within Europe as well. Much of this is policy, but much of it also reflects simple geography. Flat, well-rivered northern Europe can easily lay down roadways and railways and canals that quickly knit together major urban centers to achieve economies of scale. That’s simply not possible in the highlands of Scotland, Spain or Sicily. Put them all into the same regulatory space and lots of places get left behind.  
 

The bottom line is no part of the competitiveness issue started up recently, and so meaningfully addressing it would be a horrifically painful multi-decade effort.  
 

These are all real problems. Mortal threats even. But at least theoretically it would be possible to grow out of these problems. Generate enough economic activity for long enough and even the worst of banking disasters lose their sting, while infrastructure and industrial plant and educational standards in weaker geographies can be brought up to snuff. Buy enough time and maybe, just maybe, Europe can integrate itself to a point where the euro can be part of the solution rather than part of the problem.  
 

Or maybe not, for Europe faces additional problems that rob it of the one thing it really, truly needs: time.  
 

Birth rates started dropping in some of Europe’s more advanced economies as long as five *generations* ago, and in most cases slipped below replacement levels in the 1970s. Fewer children then, meant fewer young workers and consumers by the 2000s, means fewer mature workers and taxpayers in the 2020s, with mass retirements – and national economic collapse – coming within the single digits of years.  
 

It is worse than it sounds. Europe’s current debt, currency and state spending crises are occurring *before* the mass retirements generate far larger debt, currency and spending crises. Soon most of Europe will simply be unable to support its ever-aging population while also carrying out other tasks necessary for the existence of modern, functional states whether that issue is education or infrastructure or health care or defense.

📷

Of the EU states, demographics have already turned irrecoverably past terminal in Austria, Luxembourg, Portugal, Belgium, Germany, Italy, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Malta, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Croatia, and Greece. Barring historically unprecedented baby booms, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Sweden, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Spain, Greece and Cyprus are less than 15 years behind (while not EU states, Norway, the UK and Switzerland fall into this second group). Few government policies are good at bolstering birth rates, and even runaway success wouldn’t generate a new crop of consumers for a quarter-century.  
 

Obviously, demographic collapse has its own implications for Europe’s competitiveness crisis, but it also makes the Europeans far more vulnerable to global shifts than they otherwise would be. Having a population structure which is heavy on soon-to-be retirees means Europe today is *currently* heavy on mature workers. Such workers are productive, but they lack European *consumers* to absorb their production. The EU has in effect aged into an export union, one that is utterly dependent upon exporting its excess output to the rest of the world. Germany in particular is heavily dependent upon sales to China.  
 

So long as the Americans are holding up civilization’s ceiling and absorbing scads of output, this works. But the Americans are letting the global system collapse. For the EU this is tragic – it exports upwards of half of its manufacturing output and imports roughly 90% of its oil and natural gas needs, this imminent shift is flat-out disastrous. Sure, fold in Norway and the UK and the North Sea and the numbers get a bit better, but remember, there were energy winners and losers in Europe *before* the UK left. Now the differences are far more dramatic.  
 

There is *no* European economy without global integration. Europe simply cannot retreat behind the walls of Fortress Europe and wait for the storm to pass, yet neither does Europe have the military capacity, economic reach or political unity required to venture out and shape the world – or even its own neighborhood – to its needs.  
 

Securing markets for sales or energy for purchase in a world without Order ultimately requires some sort of security policy. Not only has Europe proven incapable of crafting such a common policy, even if the policy existed on paper the EU couldn’t implement it. Defense spending across Europe as a percentage of GDP is at historical lows for *all* EU countries who are not on the border of the Russian sphere of influence, and the country who holds the vast majority of the EU’s long-range-deployable forces – the United Kingdom – is now more likely to be a competitor than a partner.  
 

In times of economic degradation – in particular the sorts of broad-spectrum economic collapses that are on deck for Europe – governance tends to get dicey. The idea that the EU’s pan-governmental system will survive the economic collapses-to-come is, in a word, hyper-optimistic. Even now, in times of relative wealth and stability, democracy is failing in Poland and Hungary, while the far right is becoming politically respectable in Austria, Italy, the Netherlands and France. The political fringes in Germany – both left and right – have even odds of dominating the next national elections at the expense of the centrist parties which have ruled since the war.  
 

This isn’t “just” about democracy, but instead a reminder that when the Continent cracks apart it doesn’t die, but is instead reinvented in ways many find problematic. Germany, France, Italy – just to name the historical experiences most Americans find graspable – have histories rich in, shall we say, creative governance when the economic road gets rough.  
 

Put in that light, I’m almost tempted to ignore Europe’s “other” problems. Russia continues to push towards Europe’s eastern frontier while assiduously working to drive wedges between the Europeans and Americans on one hand, and between the various European nations on the other. Not far behind is Turkey, firmly in the hands of its own autocrat.  
 

The two have teamed up after a fashion in both in the Levant and North Africa – most aggressively in Syria and Libya – to sow chaos, expunge European influence, threaten European energy supplies, and meter the flow of migrants to the Continent in order to extract concessions from Brussels, Paris and Berlin. It is working. Well.  
 

For now.  
 

This is an *exceedingly* dangerous game which willfully ignores both countries’ histories vis-à-vis Europe. Europeans are near-pacifists…until they snap, at which point they become anything but. Both the Russians and Turks seem hell-bent in recreating the conditions that would rekindle some serious European fire and fury. As locations directly adjacent to the Continent, this seems to me the height of inanity.  
 

All of Europe – hell, all the *world* – should have been worrying about *all* these issues for years, but instead everyone has been obsessed with Brexit. All these issues existed before the Brits’ referendum in 2016. None have been addressed. All are worse. Perhaps the brightest silver lining from Brexit’s completion is Europe can again at least perceive these issues.  
 

And yet there *is* something new under the sun. *America* is becoming a problem, and not simply in its fall into narcissistic populism. The UK was by far the most free-market member of the EU, and its presence alone bolstered the European Commission’s efforts to keep many of the EU members from their statist instincts. That’s gone. And since demographic decline has in essence demoted the EU to being an export union, the two trends are putting the EU directly into the Trump administration’s crosshairs.

5294,"This was probably inevitable. Now that [US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer](https://zeihan.com/this-is-how-the-world-ends-part-iii/) is done with [Korea ](https://zeihan.com/crf-files-part-i-the-future-of-korea/) and [Japan](https://zeihan.com/the-cutting-room-files-part-4-the-future-of-japan/) and [Mexico ](https://zeihan.com/the-cutting-room-files-part-2-the-future-of-mexico/) and [Canada](https://zeihan.com/the-cutting-room-files-part-3-the-future-of-canada/), and has at least put a pin in China talks for the time being, his attention has turned to the UK and the EU. Considering Lighthizer and Trump’s amply-earned reputation for using America’s command of global trade, transport, finance and energy as cudgels for use in trade talks, it isn’t an experience the Europeans will enjoy.  
 

Individually these are all monstrous (lethal?) challenges. Put together, it would take a strong leadership with a strategic vision and popular support to survive them. But not only can I not recall the last time I heard the words “strong leadership” or “strategic vision” or “popular support” used to describe the European Union, the EU doesn’t even have an elected executive who might be able to rule by order in a crisis. Even worse, on anything important, each individual EU member state enjoys full veto power. The EU literally has the worst conceivable organizational structure for dealing with the soon-to-be future.  
 

(Incidentally, the same organizational mismash which makes it impossible for the EU to truly address their many issues also makes it impossible for the Europeans to negotiate trade deals on anything shorter than a decade time frame. There will be no US-EU deal at all.)  
 

That will leave the future less to the European Union, and more to its individual member states. Two are worthy of call out, with both meriting an entire chapter in *Disunited Nations*.  
 

In most ways that matter, Germany is the poster child for what’s gone so hideously wrong.  
 

Absolutely catastrophic demographic structure? Check. A geography woefully in appropriate to greentech? Utter dependence upon energy imports? Check. Almost comical dependence upon global markets for its exports? Check. Reliance upon Russian and Turkish cooperation for its economic and physical security? Check.  
 

And that’s not even the big problem. It has always been an open question whether an American-led NATO could defend Europe from the Russians in a real war, but there has never been any doubt that NATO sans the Americans would have much of a chance. Failing to invest in one’s own security in today’s strategic environment is the very definition of blind *and* arrogant *and* stupid.  
 

The award for most-blind, most-arrogant and most-stupid clearly goes to Germany, who has lectured the US both publicly and privately on how it should deploy its forces in the Middle East despite having a broadly non-functional military that Berlin is squeamish about stationing outside of Bavaria.  
 

Of course, this isn’t entirely fair. Germany is squeamish about security issues for good, solid, historical reasons. But honestly that is now besides the point. Newer historical trends are about to wash away everything that makes modern Germany modern Germany. Chancellor Angela Merkel is likely the last meaningful leader of a unified, peaceable, wealthy, democratic Germany. The question for the next decade is, in what order with those adjectives break?  
 

In contrast, in most ways that matter, France is the *exception* to everything that’s gone so hideously wrong in Europe.  
 

France’s economy is statist – it defends its local markets from competitions both European and global. During the global Order this was a massive waste, but with the Order breaking down the French have the least distance to fall. France is the *only* European state not only boasting birth rates above replacement levels, but strongly so; it is the *only* EU state that can look forward to a meaningful consumer market both in terms of size and growth for decades to come.  
 

France’s location at Europe’s western extremities means not only that France isn’t dependent upon anything the Russians or Turks control, but its proximity to North and West Africa even grant it a high degree of energy security. And with the Brits now gone from the EU, France is the only EU member boasting a military capable of independent, expeditionary action. It isn’t anywhere near enough to help Europe, but it roughly right-sized for the sorts of issues France will face.  
 

While French voters are as fickle as their American counterparts, President Emmanuel Macron could well be the first leader of a post-European France. But regardless, he certainly will *not* be the last.

5306,"&gt;There is no vote of people in 1918.  

There was. The people's assembly was organized and it voted overwhelmingly in favor of unification but as I've already mentioned, even the Montenegrin royal house was in favor of unification, just under different dynasty (the Petrović-Njegoš remaining in power instead of the Karađorđević dynasty). Unification was never opposed by the people nor by the elite, bar from a very small minority. This narrative that Montenegro was under ""occupation"" during Yugoslavia is the biggest lie that the Djukanovic regime is pushing. It's objectively false and anyone can check the historical records for that.

&gt; It was just anexion and occupation, followed by genocide of opposing civilians as an example what will happen. It is noted in history what happened. 

This is probably the most hilarious sentence I've ever read this year and it's only February. The Christmas uprising (to which I guess you're referring to) had a death toll of circa 70(!) people on BOTH sides, meaning that includes both the casualties of the Green rebels and the Serbian army. More people died in the Paris terror attacks in 2015 then in the ""GENOCIDE"" (Lmao) to which you are referring to. I don't know what kind of weed your smoking but it must is hell of a strong one.

&gt; There is no restoration of SOC Montenegro was never ruled by Serbia nor SOC. Dont talk bullshit. Churches are built by citizens of Montenegro, and Montenegro. SOC are here since 1918. 

Again, you're just wrong. Montenegro was under the jurisdiction of the Patriarchate of Peć, meaning the Serbian Orthodox Church until 1766 when it was abolished by the decree of the Ottoman Sultan. Then it was part of  the jurisdiction of the Patriarchate of Constantinople. Again, for the second time, nothing new  happened in 1918, the SOC merely regained its old jurisdiction that it used to have before 1766.

No, the Church has no power in comparison to Đukanović which was made obvious by the passing of this law. Look, the Church doesn't have the power to pass laws, it doesn't control the military, the police nor the justice department. While the Church can at best, influence its adherents, Milo and the DPS have been running the country unapposed since 1991,they exerted their control on every aspect of life and have every single state institution at their fingertips.

Japan overtook Germany in the late 60s and Germany was never able to overcome that again, it took quite a toll on Germany's global position and even with Japan stagnating they still kept their leading position in many German markets to this day.  
China built 20+ cities from nothing the size of New York, a single province in China has more output than multiple EU countries combined, that's just the current reality.  
Many of the largest European countries are getting dwarfed by their Chinese counterparts, especially in the rail and energy sectors and it's getting harder by the day to keep up.  
Many EU countries lost entire industries to China and its getting worse and worse.  
This is what is happening all over Asia, there's nothing comparable in the west:  
[Google Earth Timelapse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PKAmA2G69E&amp;list=PLLW-qoCMKQsxMMuNFeZOqkBp0E46ixGv1&amp;index=37)  
South Korea overtook literally all countries in the EU besides Germany, France, and Italy, but is going to overtake Italy as well by 2025-2026 with no indications of slowing down and they had the GDP of Ethiopia just 60 years ago.  
They are competing with the high end of Europe now in most major sectors.  


Singapore, Hong Kong, and Taiwan took out chunks of our service industries and are large competition for smaller EU nations.  
And South-East Asia is at a 7% growth rate now and are also developing in lightning speed and are a large potential issue for eastern European countries.

""What if global warming is just a natural cycle?"" This argument is, perhaps, one of the most common raised by the average person, rather than someone who makes a career out of denying climate change. Cyclical variations in climate are well-known to the public; we all studied the ice ages in school. However, climate isn't inherently cyclical.

A common misunderstanding of the climate system characterizes it like a pendulum. The planet will warm up to ""cancel out"" a previous period of cooling, spurred by some internal equilibrium. This view of the climate is incorrect. Internal variability will move energy between the ocean and the atmosphere, causing short-term warming and cooling of the surface in events such as El Nino and La Nina, and longer-term changes when similar cycles operate on decadal scales. However, internal forces do not cause climate change. Appreciable changes in climate are the result of changes in the energy balance of the Earth, which requires ""external"" forcings, such as changes in solar output, albedo, and atmospheric greenhouse gases. These forcings can be cyclical, as they are in the ice ages, but they can come in different shapes entirely.

For this reason, ""it's just a natural cycle"" is a bit of a cop-out argument. The Earth doesn't warm up because it feels like it. It warms up because something forces it to. Scientists keep track of natural forcings, but the observed warming of the planet over the second half of the 20th century can only be explained by adding in anthropogenic radiative forcings, namely increases in greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide. 

Of course, it's always possible that some natural cycle exists, unknown to scientists and their instruments, that is currently causing the planet to warm. There's always a chance that we could be totally wrong. This omnipresent fact of science is called irreducible uncertainty, because it can never be entirely eliminated. However, it's very unlikely that such a cycle exists.

Firstly, the hypothetical natural cycle would have to explain [the observed ""fingerprints"" of greenhouse gas-induced warming](https://skepticalscience.com/its-not-us.htm). Even if, for the sake of argument, we were to discount the [direct measurements showing an increased greenhouse effect](https://skepticalscience.com/empirical-evidence-for-co2-enhanced-greenhouse-effect.htm), other lines of evidence point to anthropogenic causes. For example, the troposphere (the lowest part of the atmosphere) is warming, [but the levels above, from the stratosphere up, are cooling](https://skepticalscience.com/its-not-us-advanced.htm), as less radiation is escaping out to space. This rules out cycles related to the Sun, as solar influences would warm the entire atmosphere in a uniform fashion. The only explanation that makes sense is greenhouse gases.

What about an internal cycle, perhaps from [volcanoes](https://skepticalscience.com/volcanoes-and-global-warming.htm) or the [ocean](https://skepticalscience.com/co2-coming-from-ocean.htm), that releases massive amounts of greenhouse gases? This wouldn't make sense either, not only because scientists keep track of volcanic and oceanic emissions of CO2 and know that they are small compared to anthropogenic emissions, but also because CO2 from fossil fuels has its own fingerprints. Its isotopic signature is depleted in the carbon-13 isotope, which explains why the atmospheric ratio of carbon-12 to carbon-13 has been going up as anthropogenic carbon dioxide goes up. Additionally, atmospheric oxygen (O2) is decreasing at the same rate that CO2 is increasing, because oxygen is consumed when fossil fuels combust.

A natural cycle that fits all these fingerprints is nearly unfathomable. However, that's not all the cycle would have to explain. It would also have to tell us why anthropogenic greenhouse gases are *not* having an effect. Either a century of basic physics and chemistry studying the radiative properties of greenhouse gases would have to be proven wrong, or the natural cycle would have to be unbelievably complex to prevent such dramatic anthropogenic emissions from warming the planet.

It is indeed possible that [multidecadal climate variability](http://eprints.ifm-geomar.de/8740/1/semenov.et.al.arctic.warming.jcl2010.accepted.pdf), [especially cycles originating in the Atlantic](http://www.lanl.gov/source/orgs/ees/ees14/pdfs/09Chlylek.pdf), could be contributing to recent warming, particularly in the Arctic. However, the amplitude of the cycles simply can't explain the observed temperature change. Internal variability has always been superimposed on top of global surface temperature trends, but the magnitude - as well as the fingerprints - of current warming clearly indicates that anthropogenic greenhouse gases are the dominant factor.

Despite all these lines of evidence, many known climatic cycles are often trumpeted to be the real cause, on the Internet and in the media. Many of these cycles have been debunked on Skeptical Science, and all of them either aren't in the warming phases, don't fit the fingerprints, or both.

For example, we are warming far too fast to be coming out of the last ice age, and the Milankovitch cycles that drive glaciation show that we should be, in fact, very slowly going *into* a new ice age (but anthropogenic warming is virtually certain to offset that influence).

The [""1500-year cycle""](https://skepticalscience.com/1500-year-natural-cycle.htm) that S. Fred Singer attributes warming to is, in fact, a change in *distribution* of thermal energy between the poles, not a net *increase* in global temperature, which is what we observe now.

The [Little Ice Age](https://skepticalscience.com/coming-out-of-little-ice-age.htm) following the Medieval Warm Period ended due to a slight increase in solar output (changes in both thermohaline circulation and volcanic activity also contributed), but that increase has since reversed, and global temperature and solar activity are [now going in opposite directions](https://skepticalscience.com/solar-activity-sunspots-global-warming.htm). This also explains why the [11-year solar cycle](https://skepticalscience.com/solar-cycles-global-warming.htm) could not be causing global warming.

[ENSO (El Nino Southern Oscillation)](https://skepticalscience.com/el-nino-southern-oscillation.htm) and [PDO (Pacific Decadal Oscillation)](https://skepticalscience.com/Pacific-Decadal-Oscillation.htm) help to explain short-term variations, but have no long-term trend, warming or otherwise. Additionally, these cycles simply move thermal energy between the ocean and the atmosphere, and do not change the energy balance of the Earth.

**As we can see, ""it's just a natural cycle"" isn't just a cop-out argument - it's something that scientists have considered, studied, and ruled out long before you and I even knew what global warming was.**

5541,"&gt; They were in favour of it in the past. Yes.
&gt; It's just that Abbas has repeatedly stated that no Jew should be allowed to live in their future state.


But not in favor of it now. 

&gt;Quite literally anything Israel does in Area C is not against the Oslo Accords as long as they don't take territory from Area A and B, which they don't do when they build new houses in Area C.

Wrong because all of the West Bank, Areas A, B, C are not sovereign territory.  Ownership of the land is to be decided by mutual agreement between Israel and Palestine, by expanding its settlements Israel is expanding the territory within the West Bank that it cannot give to a future Palestinian state except at tremendous cost.

It is in essence taking that land off the negotiating table. 

&gt;So where's the deed? The deed usually doesn't exist because the Palestinian farmers were just renting from an Ottoman/Syrian landowner.

Why stop there? Dissolved empire recovered, reformed and united. Just like Europe post WW2. And they beat the crap out of France in Franco-Prussian war. Historical analogies can only go so far. It is certainly not impossible, but objective indicators go into EU's advantage.

&gt; The uni ethnic centralised state will always win over the larger multi ethnic federation because it can more optimally action its resources.

Once it was about religion, today it is about nations and tomorrow might be about some other values or ideas. Also, I could point out to Chinese, Roman or British Empires as counterexamples.

&gt; why are you quoting Greek law from wikipedia?

 Article 3 par. 3 of Law 2472/1997 provides that Greek law shall inter alia apply to any processing of personal data which is conducted either by a controller which has its registered seat in Greece or by a processor which has its registered seat in Greece. Thus, where a controller is located, for example, in Germany and has its processor in Greece, processing would be subject both to the laws of Germany (controller’s jurisdiction) and to the laws of Greece (processor’s jurisdiction).



&gt; Why are you quoting laws regarding photography when it was a voice recording?

Can you fucking read? It concerns all form of media, not only picture. It's related to privacy, not the medium.

 ""**Taking a photo or video of someone or drawing them in a painting constitutes an illegal act** by itself according to Article 57 of the Greek Civil Code (57 ΑΚ, 57 Αστικός Κώδικας) even without any publication of the resulting photo, video or drawing.""

&gt;someone must make a complaint, but the thing is no one but Varoufakis knows who was recorded, See where I'm getting at?

No where. Nobody is bother by who is talking, only the content of the conversation.

&gt;Even if he was found guilty all he has to do is pay a fine and go on about his day.

I Know Romania is just OK with corrupt politician just ""paying the fine and going on about their day"" but that's not so easy sweet heart

Furthermore, the following criminal sanctions apply for persons violating Law 2472/1997:

Violation of articles 6 and 7 par. 3 (notification of processing or application for a permit to process) entails imprisonment of up to 3 years and a pecuniary (criminal) penalty amounting from 3,000 to 15,000 euro.

5843,"&gt; Counter battery can't hit you if they aren't within range

A lot of recent Russian developments are centered around increased-range munitions for their artillery. Many Finish artillery pieces are very limited in that area, with maximal range at around 20km. This means that often Russian artillery would be outside of their kill zone while firing on Finish positions.

Additionally, Finish soldiers could not rely on their air force for air cover and the Finish ground-based air defence net is unfortunately very weak, often being unable to even reach high-flying modern fighter aircraft. Aerial reconnaissance via infrared and SAR today has a good chance of acquiring targets from a relatively safe distance. This also means ground- and air-launched precision-guided standoff missiles and tactical ballistic missiles unfortunately have a good chance of destroying many firing positions. 

No matter which field shelter one builds, an SRBM such as 9K720 will destroy it. And while such a missile is expensive, the ability to clear a path for a ground forces advance is very relevant. 

Finally there's communications jamming and other electronic warfare. Even a resilient and redundant system will be hurt by it. Usage of active radar by Finish forces will be limited because they're a dead giveaway, which further weakens combat efficiency. 

All in all, I don't think artillery is useless or unnecessary, but we need not kid ourselves here. Its utility is greatly diminished if faced with an intelligent foe adept at using his aerial superiority and long-range precision-guided weapons, especially as we're talking of often rather old artillery pieces.",-6 points 9 minutes ago,/r/europe/comments/f573t1/chief_of_the_finnish_army_i_dont_want_any_more/fhx75h1/,Bojarow,1581946770

I'm not comparing the history of Ireland with Britain as if they are the same, I hope that would be obvious. I'm drawing comparisons from their separate situations. You really don't need to explain the history of Ireland to me, I probably know more about it than you.


Obviously at the moment Scotland is part of the UK and will forever be on the Island of Britain. 

Your words were

- ""Scots who take offensive to being called British are just geographically illiterate wankers.""

Now, I hope you're not so dense that you don't realise Scottish people have other opinions on their identify other than by geographical location.

From the 2011 census

- 62% identified themselves as 'Scottish only'
- 18% identified themselves as 'Scottish' and 'British'
- 8% identified themselves as 'British only'

Does this equate to geographical illiteracy or do you see that there might, just maybe, be more at play here.. Like a devolved government, their history(which applies in Northern Ireland but not Scotland to your logic), different culture, political sphere opposite to the British Government, an independence movement...

Of course you can just dismiss that people in Scotland don't automatically feel British, because they are situated on the island of Britain. But that is just the narrowest possible view, ignoring the actual political situation.

5883,"&gt; Culture is necessarily a hard thing to describe because it's vague and general but also all-pervasive.

Perhaps if you can’t describe it, then it isn’t as prominent as you believe it to be? 

Those small things you listed don’t change your entire outlook on the world and especially don’t make it impossible to cooperate with people politically. 

Are they important? Sure. Are they a barrier? No. Tourists and immigrants learn all of that in a few weeks if they care enough to. If Europeans put in a similar level of effort they would to.

And again, you neglect that these little customs can also vary heavily even with a country, yet you wouldn’t argue they remain separate over them. 

Finally culture just changes, and it changes very quickly. Think about how different things were 20, 10, and even just 5 years ago. It’s so flimsy that you couldn’t use it as a barrier even if you tried. The cultural of a united Europe would just develop on its own. It already is through the EU. 

Culture is only a barrier if you let it be one. If Europeans wanted to unify there would be little in the way aside from what I mentioned.",Einsiedelmann,/r/europe/comments/f55lbk/will_the_united_states_of_europe_ever_exist/fhx7f98/,Fredfredbug4,1581947006
