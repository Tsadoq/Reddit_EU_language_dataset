He ripped into people saying the afghan army didn’t put up a fight, as have American veterans as well. People don’t realize the reality on the ground, those who faught like the special forces last month would run out of ammunition then be killed, the Taliban didn’t accept surrender or follow any rules. 

They would go months without pay, and the Taliban isn’t nice enough to arrest them. They will go after the people’s families, kids and wife’s. Also 65% of Afghanistan is under the age of 20. Why didn’t Hungary or Poland fight away from communism if it’s so easy to do. 

Also the speech was spot on, 20 years is nothing. Imagine if Korea was given up on after 20 years, it had so many hurdles but nobody gave up on it. Cyprus is at peace with patience, the Cold War that had long American deployments that continue to this day was won with patience. 

The role had fundamentally changed to in Afghanistan, it was more of a support role. Very little troops left, afghan forces did 98% of the fighting with NATO just providing surveillance and air help. 

The sad reality is people fall into an echo chamber so quick. Politicians instead of explaining listen to the echo chambers saying people are tired of forever wars. Such nonsense.

447,"&gt;UK does maintain list of permanent addresses, usually tied to councils tax list.

That seems unlikely given that council tax isn't an individual tax, there is a person liable for the council tax at a property. If that's not you, you wouldn't be on any list. The closest you get is voter registration, but again you don't have to register to vote unless you are explicitly asked.

&gt;Not updating your new address can invalid your car insurance

Not updating with who? As long as your car insurer has the correct address you are fine. 

&gt;and good luck trying to access GP services, schools, dentists, avoiding council tax ( unless you sub-rent), receiving any sort of benefits including pension, getting new bank card, phone contract or any financial service for the matter.

That's all based on the address you give to your GP, Dentist, DWP etc. You can change your address by simply moving and notifying any service providers (and registering with a new GP in the area), there isn't a formalised central list. Even the electoral roll isn't updated immediately. The process for changing my address at my bank, is updating the address on the online platform (previously it was walking into a branch and telling them), there is no centralised check or verification.

&gt;This is not about having to ask for a permission for changing address or allowing it really.

The parent said that they couldn't change their address, even though they'd moved, the first reply is someone saying that they haven't been able to change their residency despite moving to a different county. It would appear that formally changing address in those cases requires more than simple notification that you've moved.",Ulster,/r/europe/comments/p7dh9c/share_of_young_people_aged_25_34_living_with/h9l40jc/,marsman,1629409717

As a gay guy all I want from the Vatican is to be left alone, they can say what they want, believe what they want and preach what they want. What they cannot do however is try to interfere in my country' (or any country's) legislation process in regards to lgbt issues.

528,"&gt; The green deal will not penalize nuclear energy

You don't know that. And even if it simply ignore it its will damage its prospect. 

Nuclear energy could perfectly be financially viable within a fair market. But if other energy sources are subsided both for investment and to artificially lower the final cost to the consumer it will obviously encounter difficulties. 

There is currently only one modern European design, it is being constructed for the first in different places by different companies. The difficulty and the delay were expected. With project that have that level of complexity you need too build up specific skills and production line to be efficient. This is also why continuing to build reactor is critical, because if we don't every new project will have to go through the same hurdle. 

And I doubt your figure about the 2% of the iron production... And what about concrete or magnet made with rare earth? There are reason to doubt its even possible to build so much solar panel and wind turbine. And there is nothing recyclable in an big wind turbine. Composite materials are not recyclable, concrete is not recyclable, magnet used int the generators are not recyclable. Solar panel have the same problem. Complex material are almost never recyclable.   

And who care if the materials used to build a nuclear reactor can't be reused ? A reactor can be reasonably operated for more than 60 years and there is comparatively to any other means of energy production very little steel or concrete needed for its construction. A wind turbine last 15 to 20 years, solar panel a bit less.  

Most of the recent development in the technology around electricity production and management go in the sense of favoring little unit of production at a local level. Transport and long term storage are not a problem with a smart grid and multiple local energy producers. And in a world were energy efficiency is becoming crucial there is really nothing that seams to indicate that anyone is going into another direction. I don't even know why you are arguing this because renewable source of energy are perfectly adapted to this scenario.",France,/r/europe/comments/p4slyr/contrary_to_popular_myths_nuclear_wasnt_the_only/h9kltvq/,Poglosaurus,1629402305

546,"We should introduce a payback sugar tax (also works with alcohol, tobacco, CO2, ...)

Here's how:

Let's draw some completey made up numbers and say the amount of sugar in a can of Cola is taxed 0.30€.  
  
Our country has 3 citizens: Person A, B and C.  
  
During the year (or quarter, or 6 months):  
  
Person A drink no cola, thus paying 0€ in sugar tax.  
  
Person B drinks 50 cans of cola, thus paying 15€ in sugar tax.  
  
Person C drinks 100 cans of cola, thus paying 30€ in sugar tax.  
  
So we get a revenue of 45€. Divided by 3 that's a payback of 15€ each person gets.  
  
Person A earned 15€ which is a reward for not consuming any sugar.  
  
Person B was virtually unaffected because they were average.  
  
Person C effectively paid 15€ in tax.  
  
Now Person A is incentivized to keep abstaining from sugar, while the other two are incentivized to cut down their consumption or buy a brand with less sugar.  
  
That way, people who consume in a more healthy way are rewarded. Otherwise we're just paying other people's bad decisions through our health insurances which I don't think is fair.",Baden-Württemberg (Germany),/r/europe/comments/p7lhwq/prooportion_of_the_overweight_or_obese_population/h9km4fz/,Key-Belt8796,1629402426

I suspect home size may be a driving factor. In Denmark, tons of families live in a certain type of house, wikipedia translates it to [single family detached home](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-family_detached_home). The design varies, but a popular combination is single floor, kitchen, living room, one bathroom, master bedroom, and like 2-3 extra rooms. Garage and a garden. Not very big, so it's inexpensive, but perfect for families with a few kids. And not too big, so the parents can stay after the kids move out.

But living in such a house with an adolescent is not a great fit. It's just too small, and in my experience it's one of the factors that push young people to move out.

708,"No, Russia made a lot of mistakes because of its high expectations and illusions in the 90s. Almost everyone admits it. You know Margaret Thatcher wrote in her memoirs (they came out just in the early 2000s) that Russia never become a part of the West, because it'll always have its own separate interests.  So, the West simply acted out of cold pragmatism, it's difficult to blame them. For example, in the case of NATO, Russia wasn't just not allowed, they made the much-touted Russian-NATO partnership built in such a way that Russia always dealt with the united position of NATO countries led by the US. 

Well, there is a price for everything, of course. The history of the 19th and 20th centuries testifies that peace in Europe was never lasting unless the new order included a defeated power on terms that it considered acceptable to itself. It was clear that as soon as Russia got stronger, as soon as it again felt itself a great power and acted accordingly, this whole structure - that is, a European security system based on NATO domination, which Russia was not part of - would be unviable.  

Remember the cases in European history when a defeated power was included in a new world order: for example, France after the Napoleonic wars, and West Germany after World War II.  We also know of other examples when defeated powers weren't included in the new order: these are Germany and Russia after the First World War, and now Russia after the Cold War. I'm not saying that international relations develop according to iron laws, but it's risky to ignore past experience.

The current rivalry and even hostility in relations between the West and Russia is the price for the decision not only to prevent Russia from entering the Euro-Atlantic institutions, but also not to build the security of Europe, as Moscow suggested, on two grounds - western (NATO) and eastern ( Russian).",,/r/europe/comments/p7b6t6/30_years_ago_russians_defended_democracy_in_rsfsr/h9jmicv/,Hanonari,1629387743

Heck, even I would generally agree with her sentiments. Baerbock just doesn't come across as sympathetic. It doesn't affect my voting choice in any way but she seems like the type of person I would specifically avoid to hang around with.

but keep telling me that communism is worse right?

&gt; Generalplan Ost was a secret Nazi German plan for the colonization of Central and Eastern Europe.[23] Implementing it would have necessitated genocide[17] and ethnic cleansing on a vast scale to be undertaken in the European territories occupied by Germany during World War II. It would have included the extermination of most Slavic people in Europe. The plan, prepared in the years 1939–1942, was part of Adolf Hitler's and the Nazi movement's Lebensraum policy and a fulfilment of the Drang nach Osten (English: Drive towards the East) ideology of German expansion to the east, both of them part of the larger plan to establish the New Order.

&gt; The final version of the Generalplan Ost proposal was divided into two parts; the ""Small Plan"" (Kleine Planung), which covered actions carried out in the course of the war; and the ""Big Plan"" (Grosse Planung), which described steps to be taken gradually over a period of 25 to 30 years after the war was won. Both plans entailed the policy of ethnic cleansing.[12][24] As of June 1941, the policy envisaged the deportation of 31 million Slavs to Siberia.[9] 

&gt; Ethnic group / Nationality targeted 	Percentages of ethnic groups to be eliminated by Nazi Germany from future settlement areas.[17][18][19]

&gt;Russians=70 million

&gt;Estonians=almost 50%

&gt;Latvians=50%

&gt;Czechs=50% 

&gt;Ukrainians=65% to be deported from West Ukraine, 35% to be Germanized

&gt;Belarusians=75%

The term was coined by Napoleon in the early-mid 1900s and didn't at all  was reintroduced only later by irredentist circles around Ettore Tolomei in order  to FAKE *Italianità* of South Tyrol in order to convince the entente powers, that South Tyrol was Italian speaking in the 1900s (Spoiler: Not even 1% were). 

It only became the official name of the newly annexed, German speaking part of the county of Tyrol and Trentino. In its CURRENT meaning Alto Adige, referring to the German speaking part of the Tyrol South of the Alps, has been introduced by the fascists, the goal having been complete, inhumane assimilation or expulsion of the historic German speaking population. 

If you had any dignity, also as a nation, you would finally let this abomination of a name rot alongside Mussolini's carcass. But in South Tyrol, you still play the the imperialist game making the world want to believe ""italiani buona gente"", ""tutti partigiani"". But what's to expect from a nation, the only one in Europe,  that *celebrates* the 100th anniversary of joining WW1 (or should be say celebrates betrayal) in 2014 and not its end, creating a national outrage, because South Tyrol and Trentino didn't want to participate in the *celebrations*.

This example is obviously extremely privileged and requires very diligent and financially literate parents.

960,"&gt; A government doesn't have to try to get more control. 

And your point is?   

&gt; The definition of government will vary based on who you speak to.

If a definition of a word vastly varies based on who you speak to -- you probably speak to illiterate people. Words have concrete definitions -- that's how languages work.

&gt; For example, my definition is: the governing body of a nation, state, or community.

How is this different from what I said? You know that ""govern"" and ""control"" are synonyms, right?

I will reiterate: what exactly is the point you are trying to make and what is that you are arguing with? It seems like you are just repeating what I said.

&gt; In the last part of the post, I'm told I have a misconception, yet all of the talk is about how new dictators will form

Lol, what else do you want to hear? You've asked: ""wouldn't the state have to fail for an entirely new political system to even be feasible"". And I have just described what will ACTUALLY happen if a state would fail, rather than what you imagine.

&gt; The entire system collapsing would imply individuals wouldn't be able to cease power individually

How the hell would it imply that? What will happen is that ambitious people will have no restraints in exercising their lust for power. It's like history 101 -- just look at all the powerful people in CIS countries. They were able to come to power because the previous system has collapsed and there was no one to restrain them from taking what they wanted. Why the hell do you assume that this time it would be different? Srsly, it seems like you imagine that as soon as ""the oppressive system"" collapses ""the free and civilized"" people will naturally build a sustainable, just and independent democracy with all the human rights and living conditions -- but that's just naive and betrays the fact that you've never really studied any history of any revolution/civil war/collapse of government. Practice shows that people just turn to greedy animals they actually are.

What Belarus (and literally every other country with an underdeveloped government) needs is a system that WON'T collapse when the dictator is removed. And this is actually done by creating complex networks of relations between ALL people, not just government officials, so that people would care about sustaining their communities, which actually serve as a backbone for a happy society -- not removing networks altogether and breaking stuff until it somehow stacks into something acceptable -- this is just stupid AF and literally never works.

20 years is nothing. The US has had foreign deployments for 45+ years in the war against communism. Been in Korea forever and even when people thought change was impossible many times it worked. 

The Afghan army did not surrender, its leadership and government did. 65% of the Afghan population is under 20. Go speak to veterans like the speech given in the UK parliament by veterans who served or the American veterans who went on tv and ripped into people blaming the Afghan army. Many of them would go months without getting their salary. Special forces who faught and ran out of ammunition would be killed. 

My question to you is why did Hungary or Poland not have its people revolt if they hated communism so damn much? While Orban is deemed a tough guy for getting arrested, life’s not that easy in Afghanistan you are killed not arrested. Your family is also killed ur wife and kids. 

Don’t take it from me, veterans have specifically called out people like you who so easily run their mouth but I promise are weaker than most of the Afghan army

The very small river ""Nidda"" was used in romanian times by Villa Rusticae for trade.

However, this is more of a creek ... and so it was perhaps good to transport grain. But not the needs of a big town.

The Isar is a bit bigger, but nowhere near as big as the Main or Rhein. It also had lots of sand banks. In the summer in Munich you can even see that most of the river vanishes in molar. Really insufficient to satisfy the trade needs of a town. But hey, there were streets ...

And guess what: it was the street network that supported roman towns. Whenever you see maps about the roman empire, they emphasize on the road network, not on the river network.

1121,"I too normally move on and laugh at all sorts of stuff but you prompted me to make an account/throwaway... So let me say my opinion too, just like you did, dipshit.

Just because you don't agree with something doesn't give you the right to look down on people with a different opinion. Also, they are not stupid, and certainly not idiots, for having this opinion but simply have a different set of personal priorities and values, which is their right. They, just like you, can think whatever they want, no?

Moreover, you claim the be the righteous, moral one here yet you are insulting and patronising those so called ""xenophobic dipshits"" with their ""pompous idiocy"". Matter of fact, that's the most intolerant, egocentric and patronising stance you could possibly take. Absolutely dehumanising. In my book, that's gaslighting: You try to manipulate people, that's what you're doing, you're trying to reframe the entire dialogue, soviet style.

You try to formulate something elaborate, witty here yet fail to satisfy the most basic of requirements. Decency.  Respect, both for yourself and others. But somehow this completely escapes your value structure.

Also, the left having employed this very tactic over the last few years is the precise cause for the popular backlash and right votes, and that's likely to continue if not increase. But you didn't make that connection either. Dehumanising behaviour like yours does not only NOT contribute productively, but explicitely complicates dialogue. Frankly, it's very obvious that you're not even close to as sophisticated as you think. Your behaviour is absolutely primitive, esp. considering you're trying to take the moral high ground here. It's laughable.

The military secrecy isn't relevant when we're talking about nuclear power plant in 2021, data for the current project are public. As for the past the initial development for the nuclear industry in France as everywhere else was mostly financed by the military. But the power plant projects of the 70's that resulted in the current situation was exclusively civilian. And building a nuclear power plant don't necessarily take that long, its the time it can take to build the first reactor of a determined model. The current power plant in France that use REP reactors were usually under construction for 5 to 6 years before starting production. And decommissioning solar plant or wind turbine is far for trivial, there is a huge amount of material that are not easy to take care and could even pollute the environment if they're not correctly collected and stored. There is more concrete in a wind turbine park used as counter weight for the increasingly heavy turbine than in a nuclear plant. 

Synthetic gas is a specific thing, its what we colloquially call ""natural gas"". You can't describe any manufactured gas as ""synthetic gas"", its very confusing.

1273,"&gt;Yes, and a decent number of countries subsequently went back on their words, including the USSR in relation to Estonia.

I.e. breached international law.

&gt;It does.

That's not how international law works.

&gt;What is legal or not in international law is not decided by treaties, but by power. 

That's not how anything works in international law. You are *literally* talking about *de facto* and not *de jure*...

&gt;A treaty like this is more in the realm of politics rather than law. 

That's not how international law works...

&gt;Either way, it is the semantics

The law is not not simply semantics...

&gt;Condemning war does not mean prohibiting war.

Condemn *and renounce*...

&gt;The Kellog-Briand Pact ultimately did just not have enough force behind it

We can agree on that, but this doesn't mean that it wasn't the law.

&gt;I am certain that the country that was regularly labeled as ""the Empire of Evil"" will be very concerned about their enemies finding a new mean word to call them.

A country not being concerned about labels has no bearing on international law.

&gt;Seriously, unless there are any consequences tied to it, labeling the USSR or another state as ""a criminal state"" is just empty talk.

It's not empty talk, it's a fact according to international law.

&gt;My friend, this is the internet. Everyone here is a so-called expert.

1383,"&gt; And here I thought that collectively cussing a whole nation of people for the crimes of some them is considered unacceptable. Apparently it's so only when Jews are concerned...

Not only that, but look on other parts of their claims:

&gt; And how many did they murder?

This is a good question. Most numbers are not really verifiable. The Polish wanted to do exhumation in, for example, Jedwabne to finally find out how many people were actually killed and by whom. It's the Jews who opposed that. It's probably more convenient make accusations towards the Polish based on unverified numbers.

&gt; Either way, there is a clear inherent hostility that non-Jewish Poles have historically shown towards their Jewish countrymen, which obviously has similarly existed in the majority of European countries as well.

It's not similar in any way. Poland was a safe haven for Jews for centuries while they were expelled from other European countries. And when things went south indeed (also for reasons never acknowledged in such discussions, like: Jewish not integrating with Polish and lots of them claiming they are not Polish - in a country after 3 partitions and WWI; Jewish supporting Soviets and then Communist offices of oppression), the Polish nation was still divided on, for example, ghetto benches. It's not similar in the slightest.

&gt; Yes the Nazis began this particular genocide, but Poland still shares blame for the atrocities of the Holocaust, as do all the other nations that cooperated with the Nazis.

Poland and Polish nation do not share any blame. Poland and Polish nation never surrendered to Germans. Poland and Polish nation never cooperated with Germans. Polish Underground State executed individuals who blackmailed, handed over or killed Jews. At the same time, Germans killed whole families for any help given to Jews. Poland and Polish nation are the country and all of its citizens. If Poland and the Polish nation is guilty, then all Jews and Israel are co-responsible for Holocaust and for suffering of Polish anti-communist opposition, because some Jewish individuals were bad actors too.

1445,"The tragic turn of events in Afghanistan should serve as a wake-up call for the European Union. When the United States unilaterally decided to end its presence in the country, Europe had no choice but to follow suit. And as Afghanistan fell rapidly to the Taliban, all the EU could do was stand by, helpless. The Continent’s leaders didn’t have the means to insert forces in Afghanistan even if they wanted to do so, exposing not just the failures of two decades of U.S. and NATO efforts but also the failure of the alliance’s post-9/11 approach to European defense.  
  
The last few years have seen lots of grand talk in Brussels of a “geopolitical Commission” and “European strategic autonomy,” and it’s long past due for Europe to start walking the walk. Collectively, the EU spends as much on defense as Russia and China, and yet it lacks the basic military capabilities to sustain combat operations abroad without the help of the U.S.  
  
Europe doesn’t have the air refueling tankers or air and sealift capability required to deploy forces. Nor does it have the intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities needed for modern warfare or the huge logistics tail, made up of those in support roles, it would have to maintain and sustain combat forces. Even in the Sahel, where France leads an EU force, the U.S. has provided critical air refueling and ISR support.  
  
Reducing European dependence on the U.S. military may seem unnecessary since this has been an established reality for over 75 years. Developing these capabilities is expensive, time-consuming and would stretch the capabilities of any single European country, which is why there’s been little progress on this front in the past two decades.  
  
And yet there is a growing, yet natural, divergence between Europe and the U.S. The U.S. rightly frets that Europe doesn’t take China seriously enough. And for their part, Europeans rightly worry that Washington shows little concern for their increasingly uncertain neighborhood.  
  
During the Afghanistan withdrawal debates in Washington, little to no attention was paid to the potential impact on Europe — even though the coming refugee crisis could severely impact Europe and its forces on the ground. Europeans were right to feel slighted, but a war-weary Washington knew the Continent had little to offer. If European leaders had the ability to act autonomously and had offered to take over the support mission, the U.S. would have been thrilled.  
  
European strategic autonomy isn’t about Europe separating from the U.S.; it’s about Europe being able to act when the U.S. is uninterested in doing so. And it’s becoming increasingly easy to see scenarios, whether in the Middle East or North or West Africa, where EU security and interests are imperiled but there is little to no U.S. interest to act.  
  
This doesn’t mean the U.S. and Europe are drifting apart, or that NATO is obsolete. On the contrary, it means the U.S. and Europe both need to reconceptualize the transatlantic partnership and the notion of “burden-sharing.”  
  
For two decades, burden-sharing has been about Europeans contributing more to U.S.-led wars. Today, a new approach is needed, one that is built on a more balanced relationship, where Europe may even occasionally take the lead. This would, in effect, form a European pillar within NATO. It would also require addressing the massive structural problems plaguing European defense.  
  
The best way to do this would be through the EU, where sovereignty is already shared and member countries can pool resources, integrate forces and make strategic “European” acquisitions. Critically, developing EU defense would help empower and strengthen the EU, enabling Brussels to better stand up for European interests.  
  
To start, European policymakers should ask one simple question: What would the EU have needed to insert forces into Afghanistan? If the major gap was lack of airlift, the EU could procure aircrafts and pull experienced personnel from across the bloc to create a specialized military unit to operate them — just as the European External Action Service pulls diplomats from its members’ diplomatic corps.  
  
Developing EU-owned capabilities will require new funding, reforms to EU foreign policy and a transformation of the EU-NATO relationship. It will also require Washington’s blessing.  
  
But ultimately, the reason for Europe’s military inadequacy lies with itself. It’s only because of its military dependence on the U.S. that Washington has an effective veto over EU defense efforts — one the U.S. has used to oppose EU initiatives and vigorously lobby on behalf of U.S. defense companies.  
  
Even though the Biden administration has done little to change this approach, the irony is that it is the U.S. that is entirely fed up with the status quo, even as it doggedly acts to stop the EU from altering it. To change this dynamic, the EU will need to force the issue with a Washington that is now focused squarely on Asia. And to do so, it needs to come up with a tangible and ambitious proposal for defense, just as it has done on climate and digital issues, and ask the Biden administration to endorse them.  
  
Instead of constantly looking to the U.S., Europeans will increasingly need to look to themselves. An America chastened by two decades of war is going to be understandably reticent to intervene in future crises, especially when U.S. interests aren’t directly impacted. It’s time for strategic autonomy to become a reality. The transatlantic alliance will be stronger because of it.",,/r/europe/comments/p75r0z/the_next_afghanistan_europe_needs_to_get_serious/h9hg4rl/,HappyPanicAmorAmor,1629339446

1449,"UKs figure is probably close as can be to accurate.  The UK specialises its army by having highly trained task forces for various operations, rather than relying on numbers.

An example of this was during the start of WW1, the UK was one of, if not the only european state that had a volunteer (professional standing) army and not a conscription, and was considerably smaller than france or germanys army, but was considerably more professional and highly trained. (By the mid/end of the war, it was full on conscription basically, as war changed and it went on for extensive periods of time across multiple fronts, that resulted in a lot of dead soldiers that had to be replaced in a shorter period of time, so training standards dropped, etc.)

Most states in europe do the same now, numbers don't win wars when you can easily wipe out frontlines from behind a computer now, so everyone funds a (smaller but) highly trained standing army instead of wave assault with people.

Most funding for military is now equipment, and more ways to kill more people with new and exciting ways because we don't have enough death (or threat of) apparently.",,/r/europe/comments/p6vkqc/size_of_afghanistan_in_comparison_to_europe/h9hghf4/,Nymeus,1629339615

The Turów case has a second bottom, and it is not about water shortages on the Czech side; it is simply economic blackmail inspired by German politicians. The European court, at the request of the Czech Republic, issued a one-man decision to close the power station, without even checking the actual cause of the dispute. Czech hydrology experts have concluded that the Turów mine is the cause of the lowered water levels, which turns out not to be entirely true. The expert reports were resumed by Polish and Czech researchers and the case is still ongoing.

1505,"In the heart of Kabul, only one Western embassy—that of France—remained after all other Western missions shut down or moved to the airport on Sunday. In the past three days, it has become a magnet for hundreds of Afghans and foreigners trying to get out, with several hundred others camping around the compound in hopes of being allowed entry.   


Esrar Ahmad, a former interpreter for U.S. troops who also managed to enter the airport on Wednesday, said that his son and wife were injured in a stampede at the gates. “The crowd pushed us from the back and she fell down. Her knee was badly hurt by a rock, and she can’t really walk now,” he said.

The Taliban used gunfire Wednesday to disperse nascent protests against their rule in Afghanistan, killing two people and injuring several more, and continued to block access to Kabul’s international airport after the U.S. said the group had agreed to allow evacuations.  
  
The use of violence against protesters in the eastern Afghan cities of Jalalabad, Khost and Asadabad clashed with the promise of inclusive governance and general amnesty that the Taliban have attempted to project since seizing the Afghan capital on Sunday.  
  
A senior figure in the Islamist movement met with two former leaders of the deposed government, and Afghanistan’s deposed president, Ashraf Ghani, was welcomed by the United Arab Emirates on humanitarian grounds. His whereabouts had been unknown since he fled his country on Sunday.  
  
Afghans and Westerners stranded in Kabul trickled into the city’s U.S.-controlled airport for evacuation flights. But entry remained extremely difficult, with Taliban checkpoints pushing Afghans back and no clear system to bring people in.  
  
President Biden said Wednesday that the U.S. is committed to evacuating Americans from Afghanistan, adding that troops could remain in Kabul past the Aug. 31 exit deadline, if necessary.  
In an interview with ABC News, Mr. Biden said he was committed to getting Americans in the country out and expressed optimism that it could be done by the deadline. Pressed on what he would do if there were Americans remaining after Aug. 31, he said, “If there’s American citizens left, we’re gonna stay till we get them all out.”  
Of Afghan allies the U.S. is looking to evacuate, he said, “The commitment holds to get everyone out that, in fact, we can get out and everyone who should come out. And that’s the objective. That’s what we’re doing now. That’s the path we’re on. And I think we’ll get there.”  
Mr. Biden defended his decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Afghanistan, saying there was no way to exit without chaos.  
“The idea that somehow, there’s a way to have gotten out without chaos ensuing, I don’t know how that happens,” he said.  
Asked about the images of desperate people at Kabul’s airport trying to flee, Mr. Biden said, “What I thought was, we have to gain control of this. We have to move this more quickly. We have to move in a way in which we can take control of that airport. And we did.”  
The White House said on Tuesday the Taliban had agreed to provide for the safe passage of civilians to the airport. But the continuing frustration voiced Wednesday by Afghans over their treatment by the Taliban prompted new concerns in Washington.  
“We have seen reports that the Taliban, contrary to their public statements and their commitments to our government, are blocking Afghans who wish to leave the country from reaching the airport,” said Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman.  
White House officials had said Tuesday that obstruction by the Taliban of civilian access to the airport could result in U.S. military action. But on Wednesday, officials said they were continuing to try to negotiate with the insurgent group.  
“We are in discussions, trying to ensure that there is not only safe passage for American citizens, or for diplomats of third countries and partners and nationals, but for everybody who is trying to get to the airport,” Ms. Sherman told reporters in Washington.  
Ms. Sherman emphasized the Taliban had assured the U.S. it would allow American citizens to reach the airport, and said they had honored that commitment.  
“It appears that the Taliban’s commitment for safe passage for American citizens has been solid,” she said. After Ms. Sherman spoke, State Department spokesman Ned Price said the U.S. has asked the Taliban to allow freedom of movement for everyone.",,/r/europe/comments/p735eg/france_eu_usa_taliban_crack_down_on_protests/h9gwnms/,HappyPanicAmorAmor,1629330219

1511,"In the eastern cities, hundreds of locals walked through central streets and waved the black-red-and-green flags of the fallen Afghan republic to chants of “Allahu akbar,” Arabic for “God is great.” The Taliban dispersed these protests with gunfire, initially in the air. A witness in Jalalabad said two people were killed and several injured, including Afghan journalists who filmed the event.  
  
Anas Haqqani, a senior member of the Taliban, came to Kabul for a meeting with former President Hamid Karzai, who led Afghanistan until 2014, and with the fallen republic’s chief peace negotiator, Abdullah Abdullah.  
  
At Kabul’s Hamid Karzai International Airport, crowds of Afghans continued to gather along the perimeter, trying to flee the country. The Taliban once again repulsed these crowds with violence, beating and whipping families trying to get through the checkpoints and unleashing volleys of gunfire in the air, according to witnesses.  
  
Beyond the Taliban checkpoints, U.S. Marines at the gates of the airport focused mostly on keeping anyone from coming close. As a result, many of the evacuation flights continued leaving with empty seats even as tens of thousands of Afghans who worked with Western governments clamored for a way out before the Taliban track them down.  
  
“The situation is very bad at the gate,” said Lida Ahmadi, who applied for a special immigrant visa for Afghans who had helped the U.S. effort in Afghanistan. “I slept on the road last night. Now, after two nights and two days at the gate, we’ve finally got the chance to come in. I am so happy now,” she said shortly after getting through the gate.  
  
Many others haven’t made it, so far. An Australian C-130, which can carry more than 120 passengers, flew out only 26 people Wednesday morning, the Australian government said.

&amp;#x200B;

Meanwhile, the 5,000 U.S. troops at the airport have got civil and military operations up and running. That has enabled the military to boost the pace of evacuation flights to 20 a day, with plans to increase the number.  
  
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Army Gen. Mark Milley said the evacuation from Kabul is expected to be the second largest in American history, after Saigon in 1975.  
  
Gen. Milley said the military’s No. 1 priority was the safe evacuation of American citizens, followed by Afghans and others who are trying to leave. There are about 5,000 to 10,000 Americans in Afghanistan, officials have estimated.

&amp;#x200B;

U.S. military officials have stressed that they want to extract as many endangered Afghans as possible, and the State Department has told would-be evacuees that they shouldn’t attempt to reach the airport if it appears dangerous to do so. No U.S. official has articulated a plan for clearing away logistical roadblocks, but the State Department has said it has diplomatic and financial leverage with the Taliban.  
  
“We don’t have the capability to go out and collect large numbers of people,” Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said.

&amp;#x200B;

The U.S. military evacuated about 2,000 people in the last 24 hours, Ms. Sherman of the State Department said. U.S. personnel have processed some 4,840 people for evacuation in the last several days, and officials will shortly invite more than 800 Afghan special immigrant visa holders to get on flights to the U.S., she said.  
  
A number of civilian flights seeking to pick up foreign citizens and Afghan civilians didn’t get permission to land Wednesday, with some circling over Kabul in vain and then turning around. Ukraine’s Ministry of Defense said that the IL-76MD it had sent to pick up Ukrainian citizens in Afghanistan wasn’t allowed to proceed and has landed in Muscat, Oman, to await U.S. permission.  
  
In the heart of Kabul, only one Western embassy—that of France—remained after all other Western missions shut down or moved to the airport on Sunday. In the past three days, it has become a magnet for hundreds of Afghans and foreigners trying to get out, with several hundred others camping around the compound in hopes of being allowed entry.  
  
Outside the passenger terminal of the military side of the airport Wednesday morning, U.S. Marines handed out field rations to Afghan civilians, many of them women and children. A secondhand bus, bearing the markings of a tourism agency in Germany’s Thuringia region, dropped off the latest load of refugees. A small boy pulled his father’s kameez as a Marine directed the new arrivals.  
  
Esrar Ahmad, a former interpreter for U.S. troops who also managed to enter the airport on Wednesday, said that his son and wife were injured in a stampede at the gates. “The crowd pushed us from the back and she fell down. Her knee was badly hurt by a rock, and she can’t really walk now,” he said.  
  
“The problem is that people believed in rumors of being able to go abroad without any documents or coordination,” added Hayatullah, a 47-year-old Afghan-American who also spent the night outside the airport gate before being allowed inside Wednesday morning. “These people created a huge chaos.”",,/r/europe/comments/p735eg/france_eu_usa_taliban_crack_down_on_protests/h9gwuh8/,HappyPanicAmorAmor,1629330314

1562,"That is a long and drawn-out discussion.  /r/MechanicalKeyboards has plenty of people who will say ""absolutely"".  FWIW, I use a mechanical keyboard.

People who favor mechanical keyboards tend to favor (1) keyboards that one doesn't need to push the key all the way down (that is, one types without bottoming out the key, which is often held to produce less repetitive-stress strain on one's hands), (2) more sensory or tactile feedback than rubber-dome provides.

In practice, while it's not actually a function of the keyswitch, a lot of mechanical keyboards -- being more expensive -- also frequently offer things that less-expensive rubber-dome keyboards don't.  [N-key rollover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rollover_(key\)#n-key_rollover) (one can push as many keys as the keyboard interface supports at once -- unlimited for PS/2 and something like 8 non-modifier keys for USB keyboards) rather than using a matrix encoder, which makes a keyboard cheaper reusing wires for multiple keys and then cleverly interpreting them, but means that sometimes, one can only push some combinations of two non-modifier keys at once.  Especially in some video games that use many keys, this can be significant.

I generally don't see removable keycaps on rubber-dome keyboards, so if you want to put custom keys on your keyboard, or to have some keys be a particular color -- some people really like the aesthetic of that -- you may also want a mechanical keyboard.

Is it worthwhile?  Well, I use a keyboard heavily.  I have had RSI issues before, and I do agree that mechanical switch keyboards do seem to be less-obnoxious, but it's more that certain particularly mushy rubber-dome keyboards trigger it.  I do think that they feel more-pleasant to type on.  If you're going to be spending most of your day using a keyboard and you prefer it, then it's probably not unreasonable.

The amount of sound a mechanical-switch keyboard produces depends upon the keyswitch used, and some can make a fair bit of noise; some people also ""damp"" the keys.  [Buckling-spring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckling_spring) keyboards are even louder.  They *can* be significantly more noisy than rubber-dome keyboards, so if you're going to use them in an office, you may want to keep this in mind.",🇺🇸 🍔 United States of America 🍔 🇺🇸,/r/europe/comments/p6s34c/latest_polls_for_the_russian_elections_the/h9gz0t6/,duisThias,1629331359

1589,"&gt;Yes, and before that there were a decent number of countries who said   
that in relation to each other, including the USSR in relation to   
Estonia.

Yes, and a decent number of countries subsequently went back on their words, including the USSR in relation to Estonia.

&gt;That has no bearing on what is and what is not legal according to international law.

It does. What is legal or not in international law is not decided by treaties, but by power. The strong do as they will and the weak suffer as they must.

&gt;Treaties have value only for as long as states choose to continue to abide by them, which they generally only do for as long as the treaty serves their interests or a greater power pressures them into compliance.  
&gt;  
&gt;That's  
 literally in Article I. Why would you argue as an armchair lawyer   
against a person who has actually studied law? Who the hell even upvotes  
 your factually incorrect statements?

A treaty like this is more in the realm of politics rather than law. Either way, it is the semantics that are important here. Condemning war does not mean prohibiting war. States easily got around this treaty with funny tricks like fabricating a false flag attack against them and using that as a justification to launch an invasion. The Kellog-Briand Pact ultimately did just not have enough force behind it to back up its intentions, which is why it was nothing but a dead letter.

&gt;States do abide by it. If the USSR breaches it, then it is a criminal state.

I am certain that the country that was regularly labeled as ""the Empire of Evil"" will be very concerned about their enemies finding a new mean word to call them.

Seriously, unless there are any consequences tied to it, labeling the USSR or another state as ""a criminal state"" is just empty talk. And good luck trying to bring a great power to court.

In 2020 Lukashenko stuffed ballots to win election which resulted in mass protests against him, he has used brutal methods to supress protests (there are over 600 officially designated political prisoners in Belarus now). EU put some limited sanctions due that

In May this year Lukashenko decided to intercept Athens-Vilnius flight between 2 EU capitals, that had 2 Belarus opposition members that at a time were living in Lithuania - this caused enormous backlash and first real economic sanctions against Belarus. 

So Lukashenko decided to get some revenge and possibly hoping EU will fold and remove sanctions by removing visa requirements for over a 70 countries, mostly from Africa and Middle East. This resulted in people from those countries without any issues flying into Belarus and then with the help of Belarus border guards move into EU.

The first country affected was Lithuania, some weeks ago Lithuania decided to start using pushbacks as the migrant flow was increasing exponentially (the same day decision was made, Iraq announced 3 new routes from Iraq to Belarus). After that problem shifted to Latvia and Poland.

And things seem hard or tough  
And people are stupid, obnoxious or daft  
And you feel that you've had quite enough…  

Just remember that you're standing on a planet that's evolving  
And revolving at nine hundred miles an hour  
That's orbiting at nineteen miles a second, so it's reckoned,  
A sun that is the source of all our power  
The sun and you and me and all the stars that we can see  
Are moving at a million miles a day  
In an outer spiral arm, at forty thousand miles an hour  
Of the galaxy we call the 'Milky Way'  

Our galaxy itself contains a hundred billion stars.  
It's a hundred thousand light years side to side  
It bulges in the middle, sixteen thousand light years thick  
But out by us, it's just three thousand light years wide  
We're thirty thousand light years from galactic central point  
We go 'round every two hundred million years  
And our galaxy is only one of millions of billions  
In this amazing and expanding universe

The universe itself keeps on expanding and expanding   
In all of the directions it can whizz   
As fast as it can go, at the speed of light, you know   
Twelve million miles a minute, and that's the fastest speed there is

It's, if you think about it, a way to emasculate, to shame, other men (because usually the ""squeezed"" dude will react instinctively covering his private parts feeling a little bit ashamed ). It's also common to threaten another man saying stuff like ""be careful or I'll fuck you in the ass"" (surely it's intended in a figurative sense and still it shows a characteristic mentality). All of this to say that men in our culture typically have to express their dominance over other men in rather physical ways some of them that could be confused with a sexual interest.

1736,"&gt; I thought you might care to know that the EU is not popular, at all, with Brits looking for a new career, rather than some bar work or teaching gig. 

Really? UK citizens only ever do bar work or teaching gigs in the worlds second largest economy, when its right on their doorstep?  

&gt; the majority of Brits living abroad don't favour the EU, despite their proximity.

Maybe because the EU, and freedom of movement within the EU, have only existed since the 90's. 
Aus and Canada being ex-colonies with several generations history as part of the empire are obviously going to have a bit of a head start.  

Not that the EU lacks in British immigrants. 

Heres some stats from 2006 which suggest at the time the EU was at least equally as popular a destination for British immigration as Australia.

For now. They wanted to get rid of Americans, which makes sense, nobody really wants foreign invaders.

But don't make the mistake of assuming the Taliban are competent or moderate or not corrupt.

I give Afghanistan 20 years before there's a civil war. Unless the Taliban somehow manage to impose a super stable theocracy, which isn't unheard of, but unlikely.

Meanwhile western nations advertise how they sent a single plane and take a couple hundred afghans and drop them to some shitty islamic country that is far enough from them, and tell they'll take 20-30k refugees and take care good care of them out of their good heart.

1802,"The OSINT tag means Open Source Intelligence. It's a growing practice to use various publicly available sources to build a picture of a situation.

These sources may include

* Media: newspaper, news reports, news agencies, magazines, etc. from various countries
* Government published data: hearings, budget reports, press conferences, speeches, websites, etc.
* Academic publications
* Commercial data, especially publicly available satellite imagery
* ""Grey literature"": annual company reports, technical reports, patent publications, evaluations, etc.
* Internet sources: blog post, Twitter posts, videos, public group chats, etc.

I suspect most of what that guy is using is mostly media, government and Internet sources.

Of course, the reliability of each source always has to be considered but that's the bottom line. OSINT grew a lot in the context of the growth of Internet and social media as well as publicly available satellite images. This is especially true in the context of investigative journalism, as organisations like Bellingcat made a name for themselves in the context of the Syrian Civil War, Donbas War and the poisoning of Sergei Skripal, but also regular governmental agencies where they complete traditional disciplines.

It is worth noting that OSINT, unlike more sophisticated methods like signal, human or cyber intelligence (HUMINT, SIGINT, CYBINT) does not require the use of secret information and thus can be done by pretty much anyone who knows where too look for and how to properly analyse the information he finds.","Belgium, Benelux, EU",/r/europe/comments/p6qsxk/number_of_irish_citizens_seeking_to_flee/h9fl254/,loicvanderwiel,1629308557

People who support Lukashenka are minority right now. It's a proven fact. Lukashenka's allies are mostly KGB, MVD, army, puppet politicians, ideologists and related structures, who are well paid for that. They live luxurious lives and rightfully fear to lose their privileged position. And now many of them are covered in blood of innocents, they desperately want to escape tribunal. The other slice of the supporters are elderly people, who can't access to internet or independent media and have to watch the local TV propaganda. And we all know that if  lies are repeated enough time, they became truths. They are still nostalgic for USSR, they believe that US try to destroy them, that Europe is poor and unsafe place, that ukrainians are nazis (all thanks to Russia). The other large portion of people are apathetic opportunists, who are neutral as long as their families are safe and sound. 


Lukashenka lost current elections by a landslide. People don't want him. Lukashenka rules illegally with the use of brutal force. Damn, he can't even manage to fill up his own paid rally, cause his rating is so low. People voted for Tikhanouskaja and for democracy. 


Situation in Belarus right now and in 20 years ago is drastically different. And we shouldn't be compared with Russia, cause russians seem to genuinely support Putin and his aggressive behaviour. I really hate when some ignorant people think that belarusians =\= russians  Belarusians are different, they grow to loathe dictatorship and dictator. They don't share these imperialistic beliefs. Belarusians held no grudges to their neighbors - poles, lithuanians, ukrainians - we willing to coexist peacefully with other europeans. What this old hag is doing rn is just sad :( I'm sure our good relations will be restored after this old psycho's defeat. We really think that this man is just crazy, power hungry maniac, that must be judged as a criminal.


The biggest reason why Luka is still in power is not because belarusians don't strive to democracy. It's because we generally posses a very deeply ingrained fear for violence and cruelty and can't really defend themselves physically. Some kind of victim syndrome after WW2 and gulags? Idk.

The Chinese ones were way worse. In Germany, mostly villages and towns were affected. In China, a city of millions. No comparison. In Germany, they gave numbers for at least a 100 deaths quite fast. In China they reluctantly were giving first numbers in the range of 3 to 5 people. Ok, maybe they wait till they have an realistic estimate, but still fishy, considering they knew at this time that a car tunnel was flooded during a traffic jam. Then we had an influx of social media showing dead people. Carefully and after some time Chinese authorities gave death numbers ranging up to 300. Now, I might be wrong, but I really find it hard to believe them with their course of action anymore. Comparing pictures and reactions, I think it does not add up. I find it plausible, that they gave wrong numbers for covid as well.

NOw to another topic: I as well believe that they handled the pandemic better than most other countries. They were willing and had the ability to act in an effective manner. It is possible that they erased covid moderatly fast.

In addition, Afghanistan is not even in the Middle East, it's in Central Asia. China, Pakistan, Iran, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, India, and even Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan are closer to Afghanistan than Europe. Moreover most of the countries on that list are majority Muslim and culturally similar to Afghanistan. Honestly Pakistan should take them since they supported the Taliban to begin with.

2039,"I once read the theory that historically, in cultures where people were in strong denial about the existence of homosexuality, same sex friends were more affectionate in public, even men. Because homosexuality was less talked about and not on people's mind much, people were less scared of being mistaken for being gay. Think Victorian England - apparently hand holding or platonic love declarations between close male friends were much more common. 

So I wonder... if Italy, because it was so strongly catholic for such a long time, was more conservative until recently (or still is?), leading to the same effect? From what I've heard, men in many Islamic countries are also more affectionate with each other for the same reason.

2233,"&gt;The spanish civil war meant many things, and among them an urban exode from the rural areas

That movement had started well before the Civil War. If anything, the Civil War and immediate postwar era rather drew people back towards rural areas, where food supply was (slightly) more reliable.

The industrialisation of the late 50s and 60s certainly turbocharged the depopulation of rural areas, but you should keep in mind three things:

1. The rural areas of central Spain are bone-dry and, as a result, were *never* densely populated.
2. Emigration (both within Spain and beyond) from rural Spain, especially from the periphery, was already strong from the end of the XIX century. Just look at Galician and Canarian emigration to Argentina, Cuba and Venezuela.
3. No matter what, automatisation of farming work (tractors, harvesters and so on) would have made most farm workers redundant in the extensive agriculture practiced over most of Spain.",European Union,/r/europe/comments/p6k4kb/population_density_in_spain/h9e4kfg/,Rc72,1629279992

*It’s 1990. The Berlin Wall has just come down. The Soviet Union is on the verge of collapse. A heavy metal band from West Germany, the Scorpions, releases a power ballad, “Wind of Change.” The song becomes the soundtrack to the peaceful revolution sweeping Europe — and one of the biggest rock singles ever. According to some fans, it’s the song that ended the Cold War.*



 
*Decades later, New Yorker writer Patrick Radden Keefe hears a rumor from a source: the Scorpions didn’t actually write “Wind of Change.” The CIA did.*




 
*This is Patrick’s journey to find the truth.

2295,"Alright. Sure, let’s go down that road.

The sexual assaults on NYE have been horrible and it is a problem that among the perpetrators refugees seem to be a majority, if not vast majority. We have enough pure blood German sex offenders, misogynists and patriarchs, I really don’t care to get more of these people, just with a different flavor to them.

That being said, the refugee crisis not existing for Germany is a statement I stand by, but let me qualify what I mean. 

(1) German politicians and the media were outraged at the sexual assault cases, but the same people fall silent or turn to the opposition whenever it’s about women’s rights, feminist thinking or just gender discrimination. So, you’ll forgive me for not taking the outrage of these people seriously. Women’s rights somehow only get serious traction among these people when it’s foreigners doing the discrimination and sexual assault. 

(2) The same media and politicians then turned the whole refugee crisis into a never ending story, a *Dauerthema*, long after they lost any interest in the sexual assault cases and turned it into a crime, housing, employment and social welfare crisis and never stopped talking about it in these apocalyptic terms. Neatly refusing to try and be pragmatic about it, but always keep the blood pressure at a maximum. While at the same time ignoring actual data that proved the opposite or concluded that we don’t have enough data to faithfully state whether any of these problems turned more severe once the refugees came. 

(3) Whenever solutions from local authorities, NGOs and charity organizations were enacted by way of housing, work permits, integration courses etc, the same media and politicians either ignored these efforts or actively hindered them by refusing work permits. The number of people that we’ve found Ausbildungsplätze (vocational training) for, only to be denied a work permit or made nearly impossible, got really frustrating after a while. Especially in Bavaria. And mind you, all those were jobs with companies that were not able to fill the openings for years.

(4) So once I saw how many unused short-term accommodations, long-term apartments, and guaranteed vocational training jobs stayed empty, all the while the same politicians and media continued to talk about the ongoing crisis, despite having shut down the European borders for a while, I got fed up with this rhetoric.

That’s what I mean by refugee crisis only really happened for refugees themselves, not Germany.

It’s funny when you say the island will be under British rule indefinitely. Like the rest of the colonies I assume? That “indefinite” time period? 

Which indicator did you use to conclude that Britain’s economy is at its highest in 80years? In the past few years, most British companies are offshoring their operations in the EU, investors are running away since 2016, and their local industries like fishing and farming are seeing increase in operations cost because of the need to import and export products to the EU. Most of their companies are now owned by foreigners. Most of the infrastructure and property development projects, are foreign. Hell even the London public transport is operated by the French for fuck’s sake. I really fail to see how one can say that Britain is a serious economic power nowadays. Under the EU, at least you’d still have a sort of economic power as a collective, but individually? I really doubt that.

Disagree. While Russian military is much more capable than any other *single* military in Europe, combined potential of whole EU is much bigger - it has 10 times the economy and 5 times more the population. Even if the first few battles will be lost by inexperienced and disorganized European forces, sooner or later EU will mobilize enough resources to destroy any invader.

Not that I believe that there will be any military hostility between the EU and Russia, but for as long as Europe is united, there is no country in the world that can successfully destroy it. 

Another problem, as you said, is willingness of Western Europe to come to the rescue. But then again, no matter how much Americans are willing to help, Poland can’t stand against Russia if Germany is neutral/pro Russian.

2615,"&gt; It's kind of bullshit to whine about the US's ""unilateral"" exit when they were the only ones with a major troop presence.

It's even more bullshit when our ""major troop presence"" for the last several years has been 1/10 of what it was at it's height, small enough that it barely registered on the American public's conscience and easily doable for practically any major western power or coalition of smaller ones by spending only slightly more effort relative to their size.

Practically all of Europe has had troops or other personnel in Afghanistan at some point, and they've all told their superiors the same thing ours have. Which is why their response is feigned shock and total retreat rather than supplementing the paltry assets we had there.

2671,"European allies had hoped Joe Biden’s election to the US presidency would bolster Nato’s relevance after Donald Trump’s acrimonious years. Washington’s messy withdrawal from Afghanistan is prompting a rethink.

After the fall of Kabul, EU defence and security officials have been critical of the US decision to send home its 2,500 troops, saying it has weakened Nato and raised questions about Europe’s security dependence on Washington. Their reaction marks a bitter end to the alliance’s longest-running mission, which involved 10,000 personnel from 36 countries.

“This kind of troop withdrawal caused chaos. Chaos causes additional suffering,” Artis Pabriks, Latvia’s defence minister, told local radio on Tuesday. Such long-term missions were unlikely in the future, he added: “This era is over. Unfortunately, the west, and Europe in particular, are showing they are weaker globally.”

He echoed Ben Wallace, UK defence secretary, who appeared on the verge of tears on Monday as he reckoned “some would not get back” from the war-torn country. “It’s sad. Twenty years of sacrifice is what it is,” he said.

Armin Laschet, Germany’s conservative candidate to succeed chancellor Angela Merkel, on Tuesday called the troop withdrawal “the greatest debacle that Nato has experienced since its foundation”.

“It looks like Nato has been completely overtaken by American unilateral decisions,” Lord Peter Ricketts, the UK’s former national security adviser, said. “First of all, Trump’s decision to start talking to the Taliban about leaving and then the Biden decision to set a timetable. The Afghanistan operation was always going to end some time, it was never going to go on forever, but the manner in which it’s been done has been humiliating and damaging to Nato.”

Nato’s intervention in Afghanistan, prompted by the al-Qaeda-led 9/11 attacks on the US, was the first and only time the alliance invoked its article five collective defence principle, in which an attack on one ally is considered an attack on all.

Two decades on, there have been cracks in the unity over how to end “America’s longest war”. As the Taliban encircled Kabul on Friday, Wallace revealed he had tried this year to form a coalition of “like-minded” Nato countries that would keep some troops in Afghanistan.

Lord George Robertson, who was Nato secretary-general on the day of the twin towers attack in New York, and who triggered the article five a few hours later, suggested the disunity was damaging. “It weakens Nato because the principle of ‘in together, out together’ seems to have been abandoned both by Donald Trump and by Joe Biden,” he told the Financial Times.
Biden administration officials had consulted with allies as they sought to unstitch Trump’s isolationist approach. On Afghanistan, however, some alliance members complained that Washington presented them with a fait accompli.
“This was discussed at length, and the US listened, but Biden had made a political decision,” said one person familiar with the withdrawal planning.

Once the decision was formalised, the UK, Turkey and Italy were keen to find a way to keep forces in place to help stabilise the country. But this was considered impossible without the vast military infrastructure provided by the US, notably air support from the US-run Bagram air base just north of Kabul.

Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg insisted on Tuesday there had been “no willingness” from other European allies or from Canada to fill in for the US once it announced its withdrawal plan.
“We must realise that when it comes to the Nato mission to Afghanistan, it was not possible to have an independent role for Germany or the European forces,” Merkel said on Monday. “We always said that we are basically dependent on the decisions of the US government.”

One former military commander who served in Afghanistan said there were “big implications” for perceptions of Nato’s deterrence capabilities.

“It’s all very well Nato talking up its ability to fight off Russia, but it couldn’t even find 3,000 to 5,000 troops to ensure Afghanistan was stable enough to force a stalemate, and eventually a ceasefire on the Taliban, without American underpinning,” he said.
In its 2030 strategy, Nato outlined a promise for deeper political co-ordination and renewed commitment from its members to the 2 per cent defence spending target. But the crisis in Afghanistan has revived unease over a lack of strategic focus.

“Afghanistan today is the umpteenth expression of Nato’s failed, supine policy,” Ione Belarra, Podemos leader and Spain’s social policy minister, wrote on Twitter.
“It is time to make a shift towards greater sovereignty and the defence of our own interests,”, Lilith Verstrynge, another Podemos official, said, echoing French president Emmanuel Macron.
Asked on Monday if Nato should move away from “nation-building”, Merkel agreed: “The goals [of such deployments] should be made much narrower.”

The failure of the alliance’s training programme was also one “big question”, Stoltenberg noted on Tuesday. “Why were the forces we trained and equipped and supported over so many years . . . not able to stand up against Taliban in a stronger and better way than they did?”

Lord Mark Sedwill, who served as a former ambassador and senior Nato representative to Afghanistan, suggested this week the alliance should focus its efforts on rebuilding the practical capabilities to intervene when necessary, “avoiding the over-reach and impatience which proved fatal to the Afghan campaign”.

The Afghan drawdown might act as a cautionary tale for Nato nations failing to recognise that US security guarantees were time limited, Robertson said. “If this is a wake-up call to the Europeans — that in the future they’ll have to safeguard their own security much more than before because . . . the American global policeman is not necessarily going to be around all the time — then it will have served a purpose.”",,/r/europe/comments/p6hst4/nato_allies_urge_rethink_on_alliance_after_bidens/h9d3kok/,Illustrious-Debt1333,1629252514

Now your ignorant and uninformed messages make a bit more sense. But a lot of your information is false and they are rather cliche racist memes online.

&gt;Romania brought home 140 troops on Saturday, bringing an end to 19 years in Afghanistan. Spain pulled its last troops out on May 13, Belgium on June 14 and Denmark on June 22.

Virtually all other ex Communist block countries have for that reason established compensation funds for this purpose, meaning that when the original owners or their heirs file for restitution, the state compensates them directly on account of it being the state that nationalised their property, so the current owners aren’t held responsible for it.

Poland does not have such a fund, and the current regime would rather pit primarily Jewish expatriate Poles and their heirs against Poles and then cast itself as the protector of the latter, when in reality it has actually failed both parties.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/p66ele/polish_law_on_property_stolen_by_nazis_angers/h9c7xed/,NeverMindTheStiffCoc,1629236838

Majority of the ancestors of the TC community were allready here before the Ottomans. And if you want Greeks the Ottomans send 15,000 Cappadocian Greeks (closest Orthodox population to the Greek Cypriots outside of Cyprus and the Levant) who spoke Turkish, and 20,000 Greek jannesaries who when they came to Cyprus took Greek Cypriot and Venetian women as their wives. There also were 1,000 North African slaves. Turkish and Greek Cypriots share both a paternal and maternal pre-ottoman ancestory. And genetically percentage wise Greek and Turkish Cypriots on average share 87% genetic markers and are 24% the same. Also Greek and Turkish Cypriots are the closest groups to one another. And acording to the british 78 out of 100 households amongst the Muslims Greek was spoken as the mother language, in our village it still is spoken.

If you go 50/50 on nuclear + renewables, you will have issues supplying your whole country with power at one time, and at another time when renewables create a lot of power nuclear power plants operate at a loss because power is so cheap (often at zero).

2966,"&gt; Do you know what precentage of Afganis support Sharia law?!

First, [half of Americans think the Bible should influence national laws](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/04/13/half-of-americans-say-bible-should-influence-u-s-laws-including-28-who-favor-it-over-the-will-of-the-people/). Afghanistan, which hasn't been stable for over half a century, hasn't known any other enforceable set of rules.

Second, which one and on what scope? Sharia law can be used strictly on family issues (such as marriage or inheritance), such as in India and Turkey, where they do not overrule the independently developed judicial laws. Iraqi Kurdistan also has laws developed on Islamic law, and I don't think people would oppose harboring people that fought ISIS and won.

&gt; And you think it's good idea to take these people here to us? 

Not all people who are running away from Afghanistan are fundamentalists, and with every school bombing or shootout they only made people doubt the Taliban's opinions on how life should be. That's without taking into account the small number of people that remained in the ongoing brain-drain, such as this teacher: https://www.unhcr.org/ceu/13951-afghan-teacher-finds-peace-and-opportunity-in-hungary.html

And let's not forget Afghani women, such as the all female robotics team: https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/08/16/afghan-girls-robotics-team-kabul-airport-trapped-rescue/

&gt; I don't want them here. Call it racist is you will, but I have found that that word has lost it's weight entirely.

Why don't you want them? Due to their religion? Their skin color? 

Jobbik's popular support (and their founding of the ""Hungarian Guard"" and links to Sixty-Four Counties) has made that clear, as well as the fact that the few terror attacks that happened in Hungary have mostly been race-related: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008%E2%80%932009_neo-Nazi_murders_of_Roma_in_Hungary

Do you think this will lead to terror attacks?

Please remember that [the vast majority were perpetrated by homegrown terrorists](https://www.debatingeurope.eu/2018/05/09/refugee-crisis-increased-likelihood-terrorist-attacks/) (usually born in that country), and even the ones that committed 9/11 did so with travel visas and debit cards not refugee status and only the stuff on their backs.'

They criticize government for opening conflicts without even thinking about resolving to diplomacy firsts but not a single word in this article state, that Israel is on the right in this debacle.

3091,"&gt; My point is European defense is weak by design. Merkel and Macron aren’t going to spend more on defense if the US does it for them. 

France is fine and probably has the best equipped army in Europe along with the UK, Germany though by American design is weak, they are still under sanctions iirc, or if not they have some self imposed limits on what kind of weaponry they possess. 

&gt;Personally, I wouldn’t mind continuing to defend Europe, as I believe we hold somewhat close values. 

You are not doing that, you creating shit and then dumping the consequences on us, i.e. refugee crisis. Also Europe and US do not always have the same outlook on things simply because of geography. 

&gt;If you guys are allowed to get mad at freedom Fries, why can’t we get mad at Amerifat, Burger, warmonger, and all of the other politically charged labels thrown at us?

You are taking this waaay too personally.

&gt;our military is doing nothing but protecting a Europe that hates us. It’s better to pull out and allow for relations to reset and tempers to cool. 

This exactly the kind of stuff I'm talking about. This in itself is everything wrong with the US relations with Europe. It is not EUrope that put these policies in place, it is the US! This was the post WW2 deal of security for influence and support. WW2 is over, countries in Europe have rebuilt, there is no need for this anymore, yet the US insists it is, but only out of protecting its own interests not Europe's! Because putting missiles in Europe is a gun to the head of Russia, and another in the neck of Iran and so on. Do you understand now? And this is why many people disliked Trump (not making this about him I agreed with some of his policies), not because of himself necessarily but because he kept saying that Europe doesn't pay its way, which it does btw, it fulfills the GDP allocations to military imposed by NATO, and some do exceed it, with the notable exception of Germany (which I think even if it wanted is still limited by said sanctions/limitations).  He wanted the influence and support from this post WW2 deal but without the costs associated with this. How is that even remotely reasonable? Then he went on fits when he stopped getting support and influence and other leaders became hostile. I have been saying all along that Trump is THE BEST THING to happen to Euro-American relations in recent times precisely because it would motivate European countries to seek strategic and military autonomy from the US. This deal has become one sided, it has favored the US many times over, perhaps it was mutual up until the late 80s or so, but ever since then it has only been a net benefit to the US and a net detriment to the rest of Europe.",Romania,/r/europe/comments/p4uw24/terrorist_organization_taliban_took_over/h9bbnb1/,emix75,1629222694

3157,"Okay, so spelling it out. 

To actually decarbonize, you need to transition the entire economy to low-carbon energy. Not just the current grid, you need to transition energy uses which are currently not electrified onto the grid. Essentially all plans for decarbonizing are thus *vastly* underestimating how much low carbon electricity is needed. 

Electrifying all the things - industry, home heating, transport and so on will overall reduce energy consumption, because electric systems are very frequently more efficient, but the total size of the grid is going to have to significantly more than double.  

And a whole lot of this consumption will be very non-negotiable. - things that cant wait for the wind to blow or the sun to shine. 

Thus I am sitting off in a corner by myself yelling at the clouds that we need to build reactors by the hundred count, and also that nuclear district heating is a good idea.

Yes.  I literally want reactors *as close as at all possible* to where I live, because combined heat and power makes the total number of reactors required somewhat less nuts.

I do think that it's problematic when refugees are all put together in specific camps or neighborhoods, where it becomes less likely that they get acquainted with the general population and will stick together. Similarly I think it's awful to go to Portugal and find almost completely Dutch or British neighborhoods. But I'd like to think there are solutions to offer refuge and sensible integration.

Yeah, I'm sorry your political script did not work.




&gt; You can call me a troll as many times as you want, wont make it true. 

Unfortunately for you I can provide arguments for my claim, which isn't the case for you as seen below:

&gt; Say Im lying, twisting words, ignoring stuff, etc when thats exactly what you have been doing from the start. 

&gt; you are projecting so hard it's not even funny anymore. 

You're just throwing empty and unsupported accusations. You didn't accuse me of I twisting, lying, ignoring and projecting even once before, but all of the sudden I apparently am guilty of those things. With no explanation whatsoever, only because you said so.

I think this perfectly sums up your level of argumentation. 


&gt; So Ill just sum it up one last time and leave it at that.

What a weird and convoluted way to say you're going to ignore all the arguments in my comment just to replicate the same already refuted claims.

&gt; Focusing on TVN24 is idiotic. From the start it was clear they can get a license in the EU, which means they will continue to broadcast in Poland on cable/satelite, just like they have been since their begining, their situation doesn't really change. TVN was always the issue, not TVN24. They cant just get a license abroad, thats the key difference. However, Discovery can keep 49% and anyone within the European Economic Area can buy the rest, there is no mechanism / law that says its going to be the Polish government.

It's the third time you ignore what I said, and even the article that proves you wrong, just to replicate the same already trashed twice statement. And then you have audacity so say you're not troll.




&gt; This restriction already existed, Discovery decided to use a loophole and buy TVN anyways. So saying now that Polamd is risking Americans investment is ridiculous, they took on the risk ithemselves. 

Yep, apparently they took a risk on themselves by investing in Poland and being critical of the government and other investors are seeing it now clearly, so have fun. TVN was taken over in 2015, but apparently only now it's an issue, 6 years later since LaJ rulling.

&gt; Our interest come before theres 

You mean your party's interest? Because this serves only them.

&gt; and if them being ""butthurt"" is a side effect (not the goal), so be it.

What side effect? In this situation it seems to be your ultimate goal. There is no justifiable reason to make such move. It doesn't serve citizens, it doesn't serve the interest of Poland. What would be the actual goal then? Force them to sell 51% of their company for the sake of it?

&gt; The law itself is good, PiS bad intent doesnt change that. What the law actually says decides how this turns out, not what PiS wants.

This isn't an argument when LaJ politicized almost every government related public position, politicized CT and public prosecutor's office, have money to buy shares and tools to pressure companies.

But no, wait, you're right man. LaJ, an authoritarian party which is basically at war with TVN and tries to take over medias, tries to push the amendment that only affects TVN definitely does that out of goodness of their heart and totally will not use it to their own advantage while disregarding public interest. /s

I'm not your party's voter, so at least try not to insult my intelligence with such arguments next time.



&gt; Maybe when this is all over and TVN will be fine and continue to criticize PiS, you will be able to admit you were wrong. I doubt it...

So instead of focusing on the issue at hand and address my arguments, you choose to ignore it altogether, just to say that something  will definitely happen in the future only because, yet again, you said so? Lmfao. Medias critical of authoritarian government are also always suppressed one way or another and not necessarily all at once (just as they didn't take over judicial system with a single bill, it's a long and gradual process and they managed to control a lot of it), so your claim is twice as asinine.

You also were wrong multiple times here and you think you are in position to tell me that I won't be able to admit I'm wrong? Complete insolence.

3430,"&gt; 2010-2015 was the aftermath of the 08-09 crash and irrelevant this is pre-brexit vote versus what came after. After the referendum induced a supply shock the positive growth trend was broken for the UK (with energy prices still on the low) it even went negative for a bit, whereas contemporary countries saw it rise.

The UK was far less affected by the eurozone crisis than most of the EU, and had robust y/y growth for most of the post-GFC period up to the referendum. The 'supply shock' of the referendum itself was not particularly significant, I honestly have no idea what you mean by ""positive trend growth was broken for the UK"" since GDP growth was never negative until 2020. 

&gt; Even between 2010-2015 the trend for the UK did not deviate that much from other western countries who also experienced migration throughout

That's simply not true, the UK experienced negative RWG for much of the 2010-2015 period - meanwhile that was not the case in most of the large EU economies (whose 'real' earnings were often buoyed by extremely weak inflation). 

&gt; Not to say wages won't rise because cheaper labour no longer immigrates from the EU, simply that investment (which went negative for a bit as well) and high skilled migration (the kind that creates jobs jobs) have a significant effect on the average pay, how much is to be seen. But stating with certainty that real wages rose due to brexit is not what the data shows (yet, maybe I will concede the argument in 2030).

I'm not saying that all of the rise in real wage growth is do with Brexit, but Brexit is a *supportive* factor, that's not controversial because it necessarily leads to additional labour market tightness - the only mitigating factor is Brexit induced changes in inflation which could offset that, but hitherto hasn't.",,/r/europe/comments/p5yhlk/uk_job_vacancies_at_record_high_and_unemployment/h99r8z2/,kanyewestsconscience,1629193599

For example some often bring up the fact that Germany still exports more than they import. But they export when wind and solar are generating too much, and import on-demand power when there is a lack of this. Somewhere, there need to be available generators to provide power. This isn't going to change in the future.

It's not just about how much you import and export during one year, but how it's all distributed over time. There is no magical future where all of Europe is wind and solar and they're just sending power across the continent to ""where it's needed"". The dispatchable power capacity will always have to exist somewhere.

Hydro cannot expand much. Don't expect batteries to provide this power. If everything else is off the table then it will be new gas power plants that are the on-demand power. It's no mistake that Germany is investing in new gas. They know that if both nuclear and coal are eventually gone, they will need a lot more gas.

redneck refers to literal red necks, from working head down on the farm under the hot sun.

In fact the Gotland-class submarine is still yet to date the most (known) stealthiest submarine in the world, and with it's stealthiness comes great defense capabilities, it can eliminate any aircraft carrier alone even with a fleet to defend it because it won't be detected until it strikes due to the sterling engines, if you're looking at it's comission date you are not taking in consideration the mid-life upgrades made in 2020.

There is just no chance for the frigate to detect a Gotland-class and we have three to defend ourselves in case of an invasion, basically you could send 12 of these high tech frigates and they would still never detect the submarines until it's too late. With that said, we are comparing a former super power to a small Nordic nation with a population of 10 million who have devested it's military capabilities for many years, but in terms of a 1v1, the frigate stands no chance. 

We've not actually tested this in wargames so it's speculation but looking at merits, specifically beating the USS Ronald Reagan in 2005 which showed the U.S. fleet how defenseless it was against a single Gotland-class and API, goes to show how fragile any visible ship is to these small submarines. Saab Kockums is building an even stealthier submarine which is completed 2022 ""The Blekinge class"" which again will claim the throne as the stealthiest submarine in the world using the fundamentals which Gotland-class is built on and improving the stealth capabilities even further. 

Here is some further information from someone who knows what he is talking about, which also explains why it's hard to beat these small submarines. I suggest you do some basic research before you attempt to open your mouth about stuff you clearly don't have any clue about.

As for the refugees, someone will have to take them. And No, it will not be just Europe.

Corporation needs to be started immediately with all of these countries. Sanctions against Iran should be temporarily lifted.

Perhaps this should remind people why the US, Russia and the UK are not to be trusted. I see the end of this invasion as an opportunity for Afghanistan to become a real country.

&gt; What the hell do you mean they aren't really effected? TVN24 is still a part of ""Grupa TVN"" which is owned by Discovery which is an American company, which is what amendment targets. The licence is entirely different issue. It exist alongside the amendment. You're the one with complete lack of understanding of the topic... or that's what I would say if you weren't a troll.

I guess [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-poland-politics-media-discovery/discoverys-polish-news-channel-tvn24-obtains-dutch-licence-idUKKBN2FH0YH?edition-redirect=uk) is also a troll: ""
Polish news channel TVN24 has obtained a Dutch broadcasting licence which will allow it to remain on air in Poland under European Union rules if its local licence isn’t renewed,"". It was obvious this would happen and TVN24 was safe. 

&gt; There is nothing debatable about it.

Thats just your opinion and no, everyone disagreeing with you is not just a troll. 

&gt; Lesser evil is still better than big evil so the choice is painfully obvious, unless you're a troll or ideologically blinded

How about instead of being happy with eating vomit, because it's better than eating shit, you decline both and try to find sonething that is actually edible.

&gt; And it's not like Poland has much of a choice, so unless you vote for lesser evil, have fun living in authoritarian country.

Kaczynski and Tusk arent the only options.

&gt; Making Americans ""cry"" and ""butthurt"" for their own political gains is definitely worth damaging the relationship even further, 

Reread my comment because that's not what I said. If puttimg our interests over theirs means damaging our relationship, so be it. Ive had enough of the extreme pro-USA behaviour we have had for decades. 

&gt; paying for the compensation with public money and show the rest of the world and investors that Poland is in fact ridiculous and risky for investments. A diplomatic masterpiece.

Nice fortune telling... If by ridiculous and risky you mean closing up loopholes, then sure.

&gt; I consider this as your concession  until you actually provide something worthwhile. Unless this is your true thought, then I cringe hard.

No, this is just an imaginery argument you are having in your own head, not actually what i wrote.

&gt; So you aren't going to make a proper rebuttal, and instead use red herring to completely unrelated topic while trying to twist the issue as ""daring to go agaisnt their interest"". As expected from troll.

Ive given a proper rebuttal, this was just an additional thought of how some people are being hypocrites with this. Suddenly its great we are so close with the US and shouldn't do anything that would risk their investments. 

&gt; Not shady, outright illegal. 

Again, thats just your opinion. 

&gt; It's not extremely vague and it's full phrase is ""when RESULT raises justifiable doubt"", which you purposefully omitted. It doesn't happen in case of any justified doubts. That's your lie. Result did not bring any doubts, everyone's votes were counted correctly. It doesn't say anthing about making a mistake in voting. Nice try, but don't try to bring your state propaganda here.

It absolutely is vague and I didnt omit it, thats exactly what I meant, I just didn't quote the whole law, because it doesnt change anything here. For example a couple MPs said they made a mistake voting, which changes the result of the vote. Is that a justified doubt about the result? You will probably say no but someone else will say yes.

Nice try, but it doesnt say anything about anything because its extremely vague, it doesnt specify any reason for doubts. So whatever  you think is a legit cause for justified doubts, it doesn't say anything about that either.

&gt; So you completely ignored the explanation on why it's an excuse and why it's targeted against TVN 

You really have to start actually reading what I write because, I didnt ignore that. I care far less why PiS does somethong, I care more what it is they do.

&gt; and for what reason just to elaborate on the same exact point I proved to be worthless? Just to focus on FAR less important issue? So you aren't going to actually address my actual point?

Hahaha, you didnt prove anything, you just think your opinion is the absolute truth. Or if I were to play your dumb games: the total oppositiobs propaganda is absolute truth. See how easy that is...

&gt; You're right, let's give LaJ even more control over medias, that will definitely help the situation and certainly won't cement LaJ in position of party. Better than the alternative with Tusk, am I right?

How does this give them more control over media? Do you think TVN will belong to the givernment now? 

&gt; that will definitely help the situation

Generally speaking yes.  TVN will be fine and will continue to be critical of PiS. We will have closed a loophole and have protections similar ""(even if sometimes weaker) to the ones in the West. 

 &gt; and certainly won't cement LaJ in position of party. 

What? 

&gt; Better than the alternative with Tusk, am I right?

If we were to look at the overall situation when Tusk was in power, yes. Up until 2013/2014 all main tv channels (free, accessible everywhere in Poland) had the same pro government bias, just to different degrees. So you literally had to get cable/satelite to get access to niche channels with a different opinion. Again, funny how no one complained about lack of plurality then.

3929,"Alright, i admit i am very cynical because i saw the workings of bringing Democracy to work. I lived through all the lies your media said about my nation and my people. Twisting of truth, omitting facts, and demonizing a nation, without any or very little knowledge of the issue at hand, just to justify geopolitical interests, ignoring any wrongdoings of everyone Serbs were at war with, all while dropping bombs on maternity wards, city centres, power plants, passanger trains and civilian buses in my city. I hope you understand that no person in the Balkans is entirely impartial. But it is also important to admit that the intentions of the United States are never pure either.

Serbia went through the largest recorded inflation in history in the 90's, of course there are consequences. The United States is not the sole culprit of these issues, as there is plenty of wrongdoings of Serbian government in that decade. In 2000's, the Serbian people, not the Americans, or the British, or Germans, but the Serbian people, ousted Milosevic and voted for a pro-EU and pro-Western government. But in turn, our western mentors and partners chose to mug the country and strip it of it's industry, among many other negative things, all while getting the Serbian government to make gigantic concessions, apologize for this and for that (while no neighbor of ours made any reapproachment, on the contrary, their revisionism and their agendas were supported). Currently we have a horrific government with an president in name only, and the only reason we got to this point, is the gigantic disappointment in how the previous, Democratic government, handled interests of the state and its people, and the awesome mismanagement from the side of EU and USA. The people got the conclusion that the West never wanted to help Serbia, but to make it sell everything of value for scraps, as it happened. Now it's even worse, as Vucic has a pass with a more conservative voter, all while selling everything to everyone, America, China, Russia, Germany, you name it.

But yeah, i don't think you can entirely compare the workings of an isolated island nation, to a nation that had no grace period to recover from the 1st Balkan War, 2nd Balkan War, 1st World War, 2nd World War, and Yugoslav Wars. If Americans are honest about their pure intentions, they should lecture their Yugoslav allies, who deny any wrongdoings and repeat the same old CNN propaganda trope that the Serbs are to blame for everything, going as far as to call out the Serbian people as some sort of Fascists and Nazis. The Serbian people, which was by far the biggest target and biggest opponent of Fascism and Nazism in WW2. It was Tito, the Croatian dictator, who set things up for future destructions, by nailing Serbs into the ground, the very same people on whose backs he climbed to power (60-70% of the Partisans were Serbs), murdering some 100 000 in late 40's, banning ethnically cleansed families from returning to Kosovo, and replacing the most progressive element of the Communist party, the Serbian communists, with the clique that ended up being Milosevic and his lackeys. It's time to take a deep look and think about how and why the US lead such a hostile policy towards Yugoslavia, and actively funded and supported violent secession of Yugoslavia. But not only Yugoslavia. Is America having the right approach in the world out there? Iran was once the most progressive and one of the most liberal Muslim states in the world. It was the British intervention that removed their democratic government, which eventually lead to it's horrific current regime. Cause and consequences. Think about it, American people.

I have nothing against Americans, and i hope my thoughts didn't give you that impression. There is a lot the world can learn from the Americans, but not everything you do and stand for is right, and you shouldn't think it's rightful to impose it on everyone you see fit.

3960,"If you define a ""French"" as a person born in France then if there is no France then there is no French people. Even more, there were a lot of border changes in Europe. As consequence, you have Germans living in Poland, Poles living in Lithuania, Ukraine and Beleraus, Ukrainians living in Poland etc. A good practice is giving those people (who didn't moved, to another country, the country moved from them) ""privilages"" like right to education in their language, right to make administrative actions in it, etc. It is done, because even if they are not born in their country they still consider themeselves as that ethnicity and the country that they are in recognise that. If nationality does not exist, and only thing that matters is citisenship (or rather birthplace) then there is no reason to give them that right.   
I'm not saying that calling a person of the country they are born in is encouraging those things. I'm saying that under that definition of nationality it could be justified.   


Also, the problem with that definiotion is that it doesn't really describe reality well. If you have a child born on American ship (which is legally American territory) whose both parrents are Mongolians, and after the cruise they go back to Mongolia, and the child never goes to USA, and never even speaks in english could you call it an American?

WTF is this argument?

The more baseload power plants you have, the less you need energy storage from unpredictable sources.

Given that energy storage (or overbuilding unpredictable sources to such a huge degree) is expensive compared to baseline power plants, if you have 90% of baseline, you just need to build up enough storage and unpredictable sources to guarantee the 10% energy.

No one is saying: build only NP and over build them so that they are useless for 3/4 of the year. Thats some weird strawman and I am hearing this for the first time.

3991,"&gt; Marriage is a concept that has been here for thousands of years.

marriage changed its nature several times in the course of the millennia. In Roman times marriage allowed the man to own the woman as well as anyone else living under his roof, for example. It certainly hasn't been this way now.

&gt; The opinion of our politicians and a lot of people here is that the original meaning (of it being the union of a man and a woman) should stay.

Democracy is not the same as mob rule or what the Greeks called ochlocracy. In a democracy all citizens have equal dignity towards the state, especially when it comes to fundamental rights like marriage and especially when it comes to minorities, which are by definition in a fragile position and at risk of oppression.

There's no doubt that the majority of people in the US South backed racial segregation, or that the majority of Germans in 1936 supported the Nuremberg laws against the Jews. And we certainly do not think that the majority of the people then were right to think so. 

You are just justifying legalised discrimination that infringes on the freedom and dignity of other people.

&gt; I dislike migrants from culturally incompatible societies and people who say stupid things like ""refugees welcome"".LGBT activists are among them, and I'm in no way surprised.

&gt;If race is made up racism doesn't exist. **Black people need to get over it.**

As I said, race doesn't exist, but racism does. There are ghost hunters despite the fact that ghosts don't exist, and people do exorcisms despite the fact that demons don't exist. There are people that literally spend their entire lives avoiding ghosts and demons, but neither exists. 

Race is an artificial concept created by humans. It isn't biological. I highly recommend reading about critical race theory. It is pretty simple at its core: Race is artificial, not biological, and racism is much deeper than ""X is bad.""

4238,"Firstly, the amount of Muslims in US is barely a percent of vetted people by American immigration policy. One percent would obviously easily start to assimilate with the local culture and given the bipolar reality of American politics, mingle with the group that hates them less. Europe has already passed the point where Muslims couldn't live in their own Islamic bubbles though. Also, there are enough very conservative Muslims in USA too that would make their Christian conservatives look liberal in comparison. It's just there are relatively few of them and hence they keep their views to themselves and aren't a problem.

Secondly, the real problem here is not people, but an ideology. These 'progressive people' still identify with a barbaric, extremely conservative ideology as it's part of their identity. They might be nice, good people but ask them about Hijab, Muhammad's history with slaves, murders, his 6-years old wife, Islamic history with conquests and slavery and they might not sound as ""progressive"" anymore due to what they were taught as children. And while they might be good, progressive people that just want to live normal lives, they keep their ideology alive, pass it to their children and if these children start to live in an Islamic bubble, you don't know what can happen. In Europe it's a pretty common story for children being born in Europe being more conservative than their parents who immigrated. Making this Islamic bubble even bigger and allowing the ideology to spread even further is a sure recipe for disaster.

Destabilized does not mean the country was all peachy as you put it. Afghanistan before the invasion was all sorts of trouble, and for from peachy. There was corruption, fear, a terrorist group running the country as their government, and many more other problems. Was it stable? Of course not.

The country wasn't stable, and the region wasn't stable. Things were bad. To put it mildly it was like you had a giant hornets nest in your backward that some day, sooner or later you knew you will end up having to deal with it.

But the solution to that problem is not shaking the hornets nest, poke around it, kill some of the hornets and just ignore as they make a new nest in the far corner of your garden. 

Thats what I mean with destabilize the region. The US went to war in a country again a terrorist group, and the entire region blew up with tension and terrorists spreading around the region, instead of it being contained.

You can argue the intentions were good, but at the end you have a region that is far worse than it was before.

There’s a reason the message quickly switched to “not one step back” in 1942, because you can’t give up land forever (even in Napoleonic times when that strategy was valid, Kutuzov was still forced to give battle at Borodino).  

Of course the German supply lines did run out (turns out having more horses than trucks doesn’t make an army very motorised or good at logistics) but that was very much a German failing rather than by soviet design.

4402,"&gt;Where exactly have I defended coal pps?

You didn't, but we need electricity, it's gotta come from somewhere. Lack of electricity kills faster than even wood or coal does. And Germany still runs several large coal power plants, prioritizing them over nuclear power, with the justification of ""but muh Chernobyl"", even though each of those coal plants is, quite literally, as bad as Chernobyl in terms of human health impact downwind.

I understand the need to keep them open to provide power, but it makes no logical sense to shut any reactor down before all coal is shut down first, even if all German reactors were at risk of a literal Chernobyl (which they are not). As it stands, it doesn't make logical sense to shut them down unless immediately replacing them with a newer reactor, because German nuclear power has a lower impact on health and the environment than any other power source - even though all of them are far better than coal.

&gt;French tourists surpassed the British in spending in Portugal. From 1996 until the pandemic, France only overtook the UK in two years. From March last year until May this year, it was only in September that British spending surpassed that of the French, reports Público. The UK's exit and travel restrictions may be at the root of this change in top spending position.

&gt;The UK has traditionally been the largest source market for tourism to Portugal and the one that generates most revenue for the country. But since the pandemic, that position has been taken by the French. Last year the French left 1551 million Euros in Portugal, while the British spent 1202 million Euros, taking second place. In the first five months of this year, according to data from the Bank of Portugal, the French spent 344 million, compared to 243 million from the British, reports the daily (conditional access). The UK's exit from the EU and the travel restrictions dictated by the pandemic may be at the root of this change.

&gt;The four largest source markets, which in addition to the British and the French include Germans and Spaniards, generated 985 million euros of revenue in the first five months of this year, or more than half the total (58%). Penalized by travel restrictions, the largest extra-European market, Brazil, generated only 33 million in this period.

&gt;**June recovers but below pre-pandemic levels**

&gt;Tourism continued to recover in June compared to last year, but is at about half of pre-pandemic levels. ""The tourist accommodation sector recorded 1.4 million guests and 3.4 million overnight stays in June 2021, which compares with 476,700 guests and 1.0 million overnight stays in June 2020″, according to data from the National Statistics Institute (INE). Compared to June 2019, there is a 50.1% decrease in guests and 52.6% in overnight stays.

&gt;Numbers that reflect the decline in foreign visitors. ""Decreases of 7.6% in overnight stays by residents and 72.0% in overnight stays by non-residents were observed,"" when comparing with June 2019. This was the month in which the United Kingdom removed Portugal from the ""green"" list of destinations to travel, having only returned in July, for those vaccinated.

Agreed.

I was always pro-EU even when everyone around me became a skeptic. But seriously, if the EU doesn't act rationally in this case, and just imports en masse with open arms, it will be thing to make me an EU skeptic. Of course, those people are suffering and it would be amazing to help them, but the solution to the world's problems is not to bring everyone to Europe. 

If that happens I'll start supporting the idea of splitting EU into two entities. The two parts would still share many projects and be in on good terms etc, but there would have to be a border and so on. Our part could be called Intermarium. https://www.gisreportsonline.com/media/infographics_images/97

I hope this won't be necessary but if Western/Northern Europe's instinct of virtue signaling is stronger than rational self-preservation, I think there's no other way forward for us.

4691,"&gt;That doesn't sound outrageous

It is.

&gt;You have to understand that Germany is not exceptional here

No i know because i am from the Netherlands. 

&gt;Where I live 65 square meters would cost about 700k PLN, which is €153k.

Equally outrageous to me considering yall earn around half as much as we do. 

&gt;Also keep in mind that while I have to spend around 30-40% of my net wage just for the sake of being alive

Big investors are buying up all the property to raise the rent, the worst ive read upon in my city was like 9 romanian people in 1 house (4 rooms) with a monthly rent of €1550, this is like €200 less than the average dutch income so you could say in order to rent a home right now we would have to spend around 65% - 85% of our income, water and elektricity excluded. 


&gt;I would still buy more ""useless shit"" like PCs, cars, video games and so one because they also are in the same price, really(well, actually electronics and cars are a bit cheaper in Germany but let's not complain as much)

Dont spend to much money on electronics you dont really need they depreciate so fast and most of the times are highly overpriced (just some advice). 

&gt;Real estate prices have been spiking all across Europe. Probably because of extremely low interest rates. It may(or may not) drop significantly in future just like it did in 2008-2009

Honestly we dont want a housing crisis again, it left alot of innocent people in my country with big dept because they had to sell for like 100k - 200k less than what they initially bought it for (that is also why you shouldn't buy a home right now but people are hardheaded right) due to these crooked bankers who had to gain capital by bundling these mortgages and sold them off to banks across the world, the first bank to declare bankruptcy was Lehman Brothers which started the crisis. 

Ironically the CEO of Lehman Brothers was also the founder of the blackstone group, a private investment group buying up all the European properties now in order to capitalize once more over the backs of hard working people.

Furthermore my city is one of the most d. I honestly i know rhe Polish arent the ones murdering people out here, but do be the ones that steal all the expensive car parts and e-bikes. 

As a result of that there is a large group of people leaning towards a more conservative leadership 


Put a global pandemic on top of that and you get qiuet the intense feeling, honestly i was watching a documentary about the interbellum yesterday and came to the realization that we have alot of things in common with the people from the 1920s.

It is actually. We've never had clear public stances in the region and have tip-toed in every decision because most of the people in the region remember us fondly or don't know us at all. No one wants to kill us and the few that are aware of us want to befriend us.

There are some foreign policies on which Romania is constant in (remember the reactions of Dancila's mistake?).

&gt;There hasn't even been a discussion about it in the military from what I've asked.

If it happened, then it happened already. No one will ever say something like this publicly  and it was most likely handled by SIE or the military, no complications.

I doubt there were many, if any, that directly helped Romania. But if they were I doubt we didn't helped them.

4759,"So, the original claim by Timey16 was:

&gt;Even if Germany started building nuclear plants in 2015, due to their long construction time they still wouldn't be on the network today.

Which pretty much is supported by the evidence of nuclear projects in the EU. You seem to argue that, because there wer faster constructions outside the EU before Fukushima, that Germany could have replicated those. What I am pointing out is that there is very little indication that this would have come to pass.

&gt;If it had funding, it would have been built.

But there is funding for Flamanville, Olkiluoto, Hinkley Point C and Mochovce, still they take longer.

&gt;the guesstimate for it being built is 2025.

I think you [need to update that](https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/Hinkley-Point-C-delayed-until-at-least-2026). Also that article claims that construction for Hinkley Point C started in 2016 already.

&gt;Literally the only reason they aren't our main source of power is shitty politics by fearmongers.

What powerful fearmongers there are. And how flawless the nuclear industry is.

&gt;But you keep telling me how countries that barely even try can't do it.

No, I am questioning the likelyhood of a nuclear power plant commissioned in 2015 in Germany being online by now. Or more relevant: how likely are new nuclear projects that would be commissioned now in the EU to go online by 2030? If you think that you can get anyone to achieve that: great go ahead.

So the Greens kann win the elections. For this reason one has to say: Germany has learned. Even the current government has done unimaginable things quite quietly in the last few years, as you can see in the picture. 

It is wrong to say that nothing and too little happens.On the contrary, a great deal has happened. Much more than in almost any other country.

4889,"I assume this upheaval is quite an ideal opportunity for a nation such as China. They've been fostering possible economic incentives with both the Taliban, and the Ashraf Ghani government since the coalition withdrawl was becoming a likely possibility. I dont see Russia entering into Afghanistan again, at least not anytime soon, unless the Taliban spreads into states that threaten Russias borders or national securities, or direct allied economic interests. But China I certainly do, considering that China has played the subversive sleeping dragon approach with many unstable/not so unstable countries over the last twenty years, and if China can keep a deal brokered that ensures Islam doesnt cross its border any further, then I think China will have pretty much what it wants. All of this will further the inability of the western world to attempt to intervene in Afghanistans dynamics, or even lobby against human rights issues,or administer possible aid, because Afghanistan will already be a valued financial asset for China, and China wont let go of an asset easily, and it will basically look like extortion to the rest of the world looking in on the scenario.

Also I'd think with the large portion of native Spanish speakers, that business lobbying would push harder for students to be taught at least Spanish in the US. 

I can  understand why learning English in a random European country is so important, because you are very likely to frequently use it. So the reverse for someone in rural Idaho not ever needing a second language also makes sense. Especially with the stigma against languages other than English in the US. But for all the states bordering Mexico or close to Mexico?

Like in Schleswig-Holstein, the state bordering Denmark, there's Danish language schools and stuff, and Danish is on the curriculum of the northern most cities.

&gt;Routledge, who has spent a summer interning at a wealth management firm, said: “I like risk, I’m a banker, so it makes sense.

&gt;“I hate lying around on a beach so I wanted to do something a little bit different. After graduating I’ll have a full-time job and maybe a family so won’t have the opportunity to do things like this again. I thought [Afghanistan] looked quite nice, the food seemed amazing and it was dirt cheap.”

&gt;Upon arrival, however, he soon regretted his visit. He said he had accepted the possibility that he might die in Afghanistan and in a message addressed to friends on social media, wrote: “I’ve bitten off more than I can chew and something has not gone to plan resulting in this situation.

5061,"Implications for Europe?

Consider the Taliban captured a good amount of military hardware from the US and allied forces that was left behind. Consider what they have done with the gear the CIA supplied them to fight the Russians during the cold war.

ISIS will gain access to some hardware that can take lives. The Afghan people return to the same lifestyle they had before US intervention - that of an islamic fundamentalist nation. I'm sure that the bulk of them will be glad to be rid of what was an occupation force. The fact that the Afghan army and government effectively handed over power, combined with the rapid and largely unopposed advance of the Taliban... it seems to me they always were the legitimate power there. Depends largely on how the Taliban start to act if that honeymoon period will last. I wouldn't be surprised if they end up in the Chinese sphere of influence. For a while anyway, 'cause China is no lover of Islam...

Any western influences will likely be purged. Harshly when it comes to... 'diversity'. Expect the executions of homosexuals and the likes, the stoning of womens rights activists.

5081,"&gt; Portland cement, a form of hydraulic cement, is by far the most common type of cement in general use around the world. This cement is made by heating limestone (calcium carbonate) with other materials (such as clay) to 1,450 °C (2,640 °F) in a kiln, in a process known as calcination that liberates a molecule of carbon dioxide from the calcium carbonate to form calcium oxide, or quicklime, which then chemically combines with the other materials in the mix to form calcium silicates and other cementitious compounds.

If you want to continue this cluster fuck just jump over there and respond to that question. The reason I'm taking this personal is because as a pro EUropean whose family was effected a lot by covid since last december, this simply hits too close to home on several levels. And the smug attitude together with the knuckle headedness of repeating the same Tory lies and talking points is just annoying. It makes me feel like the UK is not a nation worthy of my respect anymore. And people like you who exploited this issue (and you keep dping it) for cheap anti-EU rhetoric on the back of thousands of covid deaths in Europe is just revolting. What do you expect? That I treat you like a friend? You're obviously the exact opposite of that. You can imagine what I think of people like you on a personal level. And no need to respond with the typical, smug ""I don't care what you think about me.""

Other than that, you seem to deliberately conflate terms like ""vaccine"" and ""AZ vaccine"" to fit your agenda. The EU only ever had issues with AZ and ensured that its own contracts are honored before they go abroad. You seem to think a vaccine belongs to a country when they ordered it, but that doesn't make sense. Which country gets the vaccine is decifed by the company. AZ (and AZ alone, no such problems with Pfizer, Moderna or JJ) was somehow unable to provide even a fraction of the vaccines promised to the EU while delivering tens of millions to the UK.

This all boils down to the suspicion that the UK must have (obviously) made some agreement under the table because the usual British lie you're telling here that the EU ""should have negotiated better"" might get you upvotes from Brexiters but it's still a shameless lie.

https://edition.cnn.com/2021/02/17/europe/uk-astrazeneca-vaccine-contract-details-intl/index.html

&gt; AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot told Italy's La Repubblica at the time that its agreement with the EU was ""not a contractual commitment. It's a best effort,"" referring to language used in their contract.

&gt; Its contract with the UK, however, also states that company only needs to make its ""best reasonable efforts"" to stick to the original agreed delivery schedule, which the company could ""update and refine"" when necessary. The agreement says the company must notify BEIS at least 30 days before each delivery with a ""firm and final"" schedule.

&gt; Where there may be a significant difference is in which markets the drug company is prioritizing. Soriot confirmed to La Repubblica that his company had agreed to supply the UK before other markets, saying it was ""fair enough"" because the UK had reached an agreement with AstraZeneca earlier than the EU. But the UK's official contract is actually dated August 28, one day after the EU's contract.

...

&gt; AstraZeneca declined to comment when asked several questions by CNN about its contract with the UK, how it prioritizes different markets with contracts based on ""best reasonable efforts"" and for details around its supply chains to the UK and EU.

...

&gt; But UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock suggested earlier this month to the LBC that the agreement was included in the contract.

&gt; ""I wasn't going to settle for a contract that allowed the Oxford vaccine to be delivered to others around the world before us. I was insisting we could keep all of the British public safe as my primary responsibility as the Health Secretary,"" he said.

...

&gt; AstraZeneca's contract with the EU is essentially the same as the UK's in terms of language, with some differences to reflect that the EU was procuring on behalf of 27 nations, according to David Greene, a senior partner at the law firm Edwin Coe, who has read the two redacted contracts, and has not seen the unredacted versions.

&gt; ""There are many similarities between these two contracts, including the best reasonable efforts terms. It's hardly surprising because they were made at the same time,"" he said.

&gt; He explained that the term ""Best Reasonable Efforts"" was essentially an escape clause to offer some legal protection to AstraZeneca in the event it could not deliver to its agreed schedule.

&gt; ""However, what they can't do, on the face of it, is choose one contracting party over another. So they can't say to the EU 'I'm not going to deliver to you because I'm going to deliver to the UK,' and similar. That's always been the case.""",Europe,/r/europe/comments/p4oriw/poland_sends_1_million_vaccines_to_australia/h93wzs8/,yamissimp,1629080919

5156,"&gt; This is a somewhat moot point, isn't it?

Not really. Nuclear power was not used for heating in Germany, so its phase-out can hardly impact the dependence there.

&gt;So saying it's used for heating doesn't really change things that much, especially in densely populated areas, right?

It means that the dependency on gas is not so much down to the electricity production and accordingly not that much related to the phase-out of coal and nuclear power.

As I said, the dependence was already there even with a much higher share of nuclear power in the electricity sector. Since 2010 annual power output from nuclear is declining and since 2013 coal aswell. In 2010 [primary energy](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/energy-consumption-by-source-and-region?stackMode=absolute&amp;country=~DEU) from gas was 881 TWh and in 2019 it was 887 TWh. Does this really warrant the claim that the phase-out of coal and nuclear power introduced a dependence on gas imports?

Even if the mentioned 6 percentage point increase from 2015 to 2020 in the power sector could have been covered by higher nuclear or coal outputs, that wouldn't have changed much in the dependence on gas.",,/r/europe/comments/p4slyr/contrary_to_popular_myths_nuclear_wasnt_the_only/h93ee6w/,haraldkl,1629071715

I understand the Poles are proud people, with rich history and strong nationalistic believes, and I see nothing wrong with that.

However it seems they cant accept any criticism about Polish Antisemitism in the past or present, which is very real.

I am Jewish and Polish on both sides, both sides were from Poland and identified as Polish and as far as I know my family lived there hundreds of years... even a DNA teat I did showed me about 95 Jewish Ashkenazi from Poland and 5% Polish/none Jewish. 

I still remember my grandmother's delicious pierogi, nothing will come close to compare to it.

Sadly all my grandparents are gone now... and even growing up I only met two of them.

But both would say when asked about Poland that their Polish neighbour's treated them worse then the Germans during the war....

When I was 16 I wanted to visit Poland with my school to see it first hand, the main porpuse waa to visit the ruins of the camps and to learn about the Jewish history of the country, but I also wanted to see my own personal roots.

I tried to get my grandma to come along, but she refused, saying she doesn't want to step one foot back there and at first didn't want me too either.

But eventually she was ok with the idea of me going there, she did want me to take photos of the Jewish cemetery In Warsaw, she said she used to play under the chestnut tree.
But I digress...

While going there at 16 we had markings on us that we were from Israel, small flags etc and we encountered Antisemitism to the point that later we had gourds with our group...
 
We had several encounters with Poles who shouted ""Hail Hitler"" among other things, eggs thrown at us from windows, etc.

It was surreal, and frightening...   
I know this is anecdotal but that is what I personally experienced and learned from my grandparents... they also shot down the idea of getting a EU/Polish citizenship when me and my cousin suggested it would be cool to have.

Years past and they passed away.
I traveled to Poland and Germany since, seen places, met wonderful people, ate some local pierogi and even read some of the Witcher books before it was cool.


But I still wouldn't feel safe saying or showing in anyway that Iam Jewish or Israeli walking down the street, and I've seen allot of hate online from Poles that disturbed me... that is my experience.",,/r/europe/comments/p4itfr/israel_furious_as_poland_signs_law_to_limit/h93feqw/,shongizmo,1629072205

&gt;That type of metaphore is called exaggeration.

An ""exaggeration"" is not a metaphore. We say something is an exaggeration when the metaphor *failed.*

&gt;It this case I meant to show that something like that is just pushing into very bad direction, extreme case of that is what I was typing about.

Google ""slippery slope fallacy""

&gt;Maybe I don't care about ethnicity enough to think that way which you described.

""I don't care about X"" or ""you're just offended over X"" are not arguments. You're arguing from emotion and projecting it onto me.

&gt; I just wanted to keep it short.

So did I, but then you accused me of not responding properly so here we are.

&gt;I am from Poland and talking about history of our country when talking about political issues is a common thing here.

The comparison between vaccine passports and the star of David has been made all over Europe and America. There's nothing special about you being from Poland. It's still a bad comparison no matter who makes it.

&gt;PS Jew is not ethnicty only genius. You are looking really shallow into meanining of that word.

&gt;I know how Nazi threated it but I alway have in back of the head all the other meanings.

You just defeated your own point. The nazis treated them as a race, so if you make the nazi comparison, that's what we're talking about (ethnicity, since the nazi view of ""race"" was so incorrect). Just out of curiosity: other than ethnicity and religion are the other meanings to being jewish? Your comment sounds like that.

&gt;Jesus, like a talking to the wall You have your agenda and you will force it no matter what cuz you feel offended or whatever.

&gt;I can read fast too but I know from expierience that faster means that I don't try really to get into a thing and take it into considerstion bro.

In all fairness, man, you didn't really address my points in any of your comments either other than ""I don'r care"" or ""you are wrong"". Refute those two points:

A) you can get vaccinated if the restrictions piss you off.. what should a jew in nazi Germany have done about the discrimination? There was no vaccine that made them not-jewish (ignoring the faxmct that we're talking about their literal identity here)

B) the restrictions for non-vaccinated people are because of the pandemic. Two years ago we didn't talk about this because the covid19 didn't yet exist (or hadn't spread yet).

5276,"&gt; Iran is an theocracy

So is Saudi Arabia.

&gt;  their ""democracy"" is a sham as Iranians choose only amongst those who their unelected ""Supreme Leader"" approves and you can guess whom he approves

Even so there is significant difference between moderates and hardliners winning elections.

&gt; The women will be jailed for not wearing hijab.

Same in Saudi Arabia. They will also get jailed for plenty of other shit. Leaving house without guarding is just now being allowed. And jailing is one of better fates. Saudi Arabia still has shit like lashing and beheading.

&gt; And their laws for ""non-Muslims"" are only for historical population of non-Muslims in Iran, like Iranian Armenians.

Still much better than what non-Muslims in Saudi Arabia get.

&gt; So stop this silly whitewashing of Iran, please.

I can't stop, because I haven't started.

&gt; The ""murderous cunt"" in Saudi Arabia is at least not an Islamist

Whether he personally is Islamist is irrelevant. Regime of country which he rules is. Wahhabism is form of Islamism.

&gt;  who trying to become akin to your average Middle Eastern secular dictator that is also allied to the West and is easing Islamic laws every year in the country

He is not very good at ""secular"" part and he is easing Islamic laws at snail's pace.

&gt; Like allowing women to drive, removing a religious police from the streets, etc.

Women have been able to drive in Iran before he was born.

&gt; Saudi Arabia is changing

It makes one tiny step when it is hundred steps behind. At least something, I guess, but it still sucks hard.

&gt; now you'll probably be more in trouble from your family if you do something Unislamic in the country, than from the government

That modern technology spreads plagues easier is true. That you could come even close to locking down a country in 1902 is a completely underestimating globalization.

The Roman senate literally worried about their trade deficite with China. Even more insular societies like the entire Western hemisphere were decimated decades after contracting Eurasian diseases and they didn't even have horses, much less trains and steam ships.

When the US pulled all that stuff away so quickly it could not adequately be replaced and thus left many soldiers stranded with out any support or supplies.

Add to that the the numerous interviews of soldiers claiming they would have fought but higher command ordered pullbacks. Also Afghani minister of defense calling Afghan president Ashran Ghani a traitor ordering large parts of forces to retreat to Kabul to dip himself a few days later. 

Without any real support from leadership or on the ground while being low on supplies/money I can see why many Afghan soldiers retreated. I believe these are much bigger reasons for the collapse rather than a large portion of Afghan population supporting the Taliban.

There is about a 10 to 15% of teachers who aren't vaccinated (the vast majority of which doesn't want to take it, at this point) and trade unions want to protect that 10-15%. So they managed to have tests free for teachers who don't want to vaccinate (then we could start to wonder: why in the world should *only* novax teachers and not also, who knows, novax railway personnel, have tests for free?).

The same reasoning applies, more or less, to other jobs: employers want the green pass to be implemented, so trade unions don't want it because they don't want any discrimination or penalization for unvaccinated workers. As if they wanted to ask for the opposite of what companies ask for. It maybe can be a bit more understandable since some regions are a bit behind with the vaccination campaign (but at this point who wanted the vaccine could have already done it), even if, from what it seems to me, they seem to care more of unvaccinated people than of ""protecting"" vaccinated ones, who, moreover, are the majority of workers (but this is only my opinion on the matter, I could be wrong!).",Italy | EU,/r/europe/comments/p4orva/what_happened_in_your_country_this_week_20210815/h9216rk/,listello,1629049888

Got derailed into oblivion by very, very effective and very *dishonest* protests, culminating in nuclear energy being declared outright illegal. Very good at organizing. Very willing to lie through their teeth to win. (A very common argument was that nuclear was just big capital wanting to make money. But the utilities were non-profits!.

Every building a solar panel and a battery will still be too little to efficiently run modern society. It is nowhere near enough capacity, and there is no redundancy might something fail. It is also impossible for hospitals and other essential services to run on intermittent power, so it sounds like a nice idea, but it is not feasible. 

Also, batteries and solar panels have a limited lifetime too, and their toxic waste is also hardly recycled. So there is a waste problem here too.

Covid-19: Covid figures continue to rise very slowly.

* Despite this the rules were relaxed again. Festivals without restrictions are allowed again, but only people who are fully vaccinated for two weeks or who could show a recent negative test are allowed to enter. The honour of the first post-covid festival was reserved for metal festival Alcatraz.
* Also football stadiums are open now, although some clubs still reserve a part for not fully vaccinated fans where they still need to wear mouth masks.
* The vaccination numbers: https://covid-vaccinatie.be/en

Politics: What to do with Afghan refugees?

* Secretary of State for Asylum and Migration [Sammy Mahdi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sammy_Mahdi) (CD&amp;V) signed a letter to the EU, together with Greece, Denmark, Germany, Austria and the Netherlands, to ask to continue with the repatriation of rejected Afghan asylum seekers. The green parties condemned this and want the government to temporarily halt repatriations to Afghanistan. De facto repatriations now are no longer possible due to the rapid collapse of the Afghan government, so I don't know if this policy will continue to stand.
* Afghan translators who co-operated with our army can get visa to flee to Belgium.

Thatcher and the environment is complex.  She brought the environment to the world stage as an important issue with UK in 1989 (https://www.margaretthatcher.org/document/107817).  

Nationally in the late 80s she enshrined the environment it into the main party policies for the elections, seeing the Green party growing influence.

Regardless of views, you have to remember she was incredibly bright, studying chemistry at Oxford, became a research scientist for a few years before becoming a barrister.  So she understood data and science.

Chinese debt trap is a conspiracy? In which world are you living in?

&gt;There is nothing stopping countries far away from China to default on the debt and move on.

Look China makes small countries fall into their debt trap or countries which have a weak economy. Take pakistan or many African nations as example. Pakistan was recently asked by Saudi to repay it's 1 billion dollar loan, pakistan had to take a loan of almost same amount from China to pay that off. Do you think these countries can actually just pay the debt they owe to china and move on? Absolutely no. China knows these countries are weak target and will act as puppet states for them that's why they pump money into these nations. Pumping money into them brings employment to Chinese people as the infra tenders are given to Chinese companies and the labour is also Chinese on the other hand these nations take China's side in UN when there is voting on any issue.

5815,"I’ve read the full text of the protocol Minsk-II and I’m struggling to find something that would support what you’re saying.

The agreement formally recognised the separatist movements which I think we can all agree is no good but perhaps it is politically required because Ukraine will never retake those lands from Russia and keeping an open conflict ongoing that really can’t be won is not good. 

With that said I am also well aware of Russia’s foreign policy towards Ukraine and they genuinely wish to take all of it but this agreement would not allow this. It would actually make it harder because the conflict would officially close and any additional conflict would have to be started by Russia. The current conflict has created ambiguity in the region and Russia has expanded the borders in small steps and in key locations. This protocol requires the “special regime” to formally indicate its borders and to relinquish control of then borders immediately to Ukraine. 

The only issue I can see is the holding of elections in the Russian occupied regions. There is no way any pro-democratic candidate would win an election there which means Russian politicians would essentially get a free seat at the table in Ukrainian politics. This is not ideal but it is also barely an improvement or regression over the current Ukrainian political landscape. 

I think at this stage Ukraine either formally concedes its claims and gives up the eastern lands to Russia or it forces an agreement into place that locks those regions into Ukrainian control but permits open elections in the regions which would create a de facto separatist political party within Ukrainian politics. There really is no alternative here, stabilising the region is essential.

I personally would prefer if Ukraine gave up the lands outright to protect its own democracy. Separatist political parties being given a legitimate platform in Ukrainian democracy is just a disaster. There parties actively don’t want a democracy, they don’t want the very Ukrainian state to exist. 

For some reasons the current government doesn’t want to give up the lands so this is the solution available.",,/r/europe/comments/p47bxt/today_near_president_office_in_ukraine/h90inrj/,Thom0101011100,1629020796

Oh I'm sure the infrared rays getting absorbed by the CO2 from Polands electricity produciton will understand.

Who gives a shit if Serbia is poor? r/europe constantly shits on China and India for their emissions.

&gt;In comparable countries, only Poland and Romania do worse than Germany. And that's already stretching the notion of what is comparable!

Italy, Ireland, UK, Netherlands, Estonia. You don't know what you are talking about.

&gt;Finally, there is about zero anti German sentiment on /r/europe. Only the energy policy gets criticized, and that's for good reasons.

I never claimed that there was an anti-german sentiment. But there is a brain-less circljerk about Germany's energy policy by monkeys like yourself despite Germany doing much more than many other countries and constantly doing more.

Right as we speak Ireland's CO2e/Kwh is twice that of Germany's. There has never ever in any single thread on this subreddit been any redditor who has been angry at Ireland or its energy Policy.

Im also questioning your net value theory a bit. Might be true, but it would seem more logically to me that the subjects change which define progressives and conservatives as such. E.g, homosexuality is now commonly accepted in the Netherlands. However, some of the old activists dont really appreciate the emancipation of transsexuals. Thats not really die to them becoming more conservative, but because the underlying meaning of conservative and progressive have changed.

5893,"&gt;I don't know what you're talking about re: grudges. As to the second part, I suspect Russia and China will do whatever they think they can get away with

Because Russia and China are two regimes who engage in usage of prior suffering (WWII or the ""Century of Humiliation"") as part of their internal propaganda, so they certainly have a grudge against Japan, Europe (France, Germany, UK etc...) and the US. As well as with their former tributaries and satellite states.

I'm saying that the revanchist-collective punishment logic you mentioned is one which we definitely don't want encouraged.

&gt;Fine. Since then, we have developed smart bomb technology in order to more easily target exactly the targets we want. We don't strafe cities with massive bomber formations. The tactics in AFG were mainly travelling around from village to village and risking getting blown up on the way. And hundreds of billions were sunk into the country trying to improve things like infrastructure. Compared to even most modern wars, it was fought in a very humanitarian way.

Humanitarian yes, but also smarter. Blowing up the infrastructure you need, and are probably building is stupid, especially when it's against an insurgency. It can be said that it's a good job that one didn't go door to door killing everyone, or glassing cities, but there's no prize for basic decency for what should be a democratic country.

I was referring to events with like the Bereton Report, Kandahar Massacre, and other such events, but if the barometer is on massacres is extermination and a nuclear strike, then of course it's humanitarian in comparison.

 &gt;In case you've forgotten, there were recent negotiations with the Taliban and they are currently breaking them. Shockingly, backward barbarians don't necessarily keep to their word.

Funny, I was going to mention that the US did negotiate with the Taliban for the peace treaty. A lot of people and countries don't seem to keep their word recently, backward barbarians and ""civilized countries"" alike.

No, I'm going under the logic that the Taliban would be stupid not to hand over Bin Laden, and would be stupid to twiddle their thumbs versus the Afghan government for a binding agreement. But, I'll concede that it wouldn't have stopped terrorist attacks.

&gt; Hence my ""maybe just nuke them next time"" comment. Could save a lot of US lives and $ given we know how past efforts to fix their society turned out.

See, it's either a joke that has fallen flat, or a comment that masqueraded as a joke. I really hope I don't have to explain exactly why nuking another nation isn't a good idea...

&gt;I'm saying the lesson is don't waste blood and treasure trying to build a functioning nation-state out of a pile of shit. That means other options needed to be considered in the case of deterring and responding future terrorist attacks.

Oh please, the oligarchs of your shithole country made a lot of money out of this. Probably the oligarchs of a lot of countries as well, particularly in NATO. If someone starts a project that goes for that cost for any other scenario then governmental, someone would be nailed to the wall for coming up with nothing. 

Even the ""Afghanistan papers"" showed that military officials in charge misled the public and had a muddle understanding of what to do. 

It failed to build a country again (strange considering it had some successes), so maybe there were bad foundations, maybe skill was lost, maybe there were misconceptions. Whatever the case,  it's all sour grapes, the US has made a good amount of hollow threats at this point. ""We'll take down China, we'll economically crush the EU, we'll show these tinpot dictators, we'll constrain Russia, we'll glass the Taliban etc..."" 

Going on an about face for building up a place for ""freedom"" to just nuking it because some 'backward savages' managed to fulfill their objectives isn't scary, it's pathetic.
