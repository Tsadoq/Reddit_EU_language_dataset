It is true that being germanic and german are two different things. But alsatians, for all intents and purposes, arw german. No different than the germans around them who live in germany which speak the same regional german dialect at least traditionally. However lets take dutch, they are germanic but dont call themselves as german. Which is not even entirely true since dutch comes from deutsch but in any case they are germanic not german. 

Also I answered you earlier. At this point, political scene and history I dont think alsatians could even consider themselves as german. And german language there will slowly die.

Its like the whole ""n-word pass"" -- you're only 'allowed' to take part in the debate if you're part of the right group. White privelege and a happy lack of trauma prevents white Europeans from questioning these issues and they fester. The main people who give them voice are racists/extremists or untrustworthy sources because the mainstream is too scared of the taboo. It undermines faith in our institutions and people who disagree with something like stoning suddenly find themselves on the same side as fascists and berks and they become MAGA/Brexit loons. Some of the bleeding hearts harden into Antifa whilst cultural conservatives are lampooned by the media as dinosaurs - even if they only want to conserve the current/recent culture. People balkanise and society struggles, thats what may happen when these things happen too quickly or are not controlled.

A more interesting analysis for people to dissect is perhaps...

Now if you look back to the ancient history pf modern day greece you will notice that it wasnt a nation, (like medieval italy) but city states, now the main ones be  Athens, Sparta, Pella(the past capital of makedonia) Corinth, Thebes, Delphoi,and all the other separate islands here and there, not a single one of them actually called themselves hellenes ( the greek word for greece) but they were going by their state name or kingdom.

Alexander the Great, after he succeded his father Philip was the first to call greece Hellas and unify most of the reluctant city states. Why is he so important for greek history? There you go He created Hellas and Hellenism. I am not going to many details on this so all the greek city states were bonded by language, religion and culture, usually going by the particular god they worshipped, much like pre-persian egypt.

Paionians had another city state/kingdom on the north of the Makedonian one and their capital was Bylazora modern day Veles (which is conviniently located right in the middle of F.Y.R.O.M.) paionians were a different tribe (even though some people argue they were greeks, they were mostly related to illirians and thracians) they were on a different sides with the hellenistic kimgdom and they actually lunched a lot of attacks to the nothern part of the macedonian region(If i recall correctly they sided with both the persians and the troyans)

Back to alexander the great, he said:
Our enemies are Medes and Persians, men who for centuries have lived soft and luxurious lives; we of Macedon for generations past have been trained in the hard school of danger and war. Above all, we are free men, and they are slaves. There are Greek troops, to be sure, in Persian service — but how different is their cause from ours! They will be fighting for pay — and not much of at that; we, on the contrary, shall fight for Greece, and our hearts will be in it. As for our foreign troops — Thracians, Paeonians, Illyrians, Agrianes — they are the best and stoutest soldiers in Europe, and they will find as their opponents the slackest and softest of the tribes of Asia. And what, finally, of the two men in supreme command? You have Alexander, they — Darius!

I will just leave that here


All these are in about 400-300 BC written in the greek language. Later on during the byzantine era the slavic tribes started arriving  in the nothernmost part of the byzantine held balkan territories in about 500-600 AD which is about a millenia later (If you are about to argue about how byzantines were not greeks but romans and all that i will let you find all the answers you need on the internet, but make sure to check about how the romans started their culture their religion and culture  their main languages, influences as well as the language and culture of byzantines,and then we can agree or dissagree who conquered who)


The real chaos emerged when the ottomans came over and things got a little bit of messed up both culturally and linguistically even though both the greek side and the slavic side kept their linguistic and cultural identities after a lot of years until their revolutions. 
After the revolutions the balcan peninsula consisted of Greece, Albania,Bulgaria and Yugoslavia
Later on after the second world war yugoslavia broke in Serbia,(arguably, Kosovo), slovenia, croatia,boznia and herzegovina,montenegro and vardar banovina(yeah, F.Y.R.O.M.) 

later in the 20th century and after the yugoslavian separation this country suffered an identity crisis and after a movement started to say they decented from the ancient kingdom of maKedonia so they were the original maCedonians and long story short they got into power manipulated a lot of the above details (which you can freely browse on the internet, not wikipedia, reliable non manipulative sources of internet), which included the manipulation of their history books and culture (plus the former usage of the ""vergina sun"" a defacto greek symbolism which was later changed into their modern day flag which suprisingly resebles the japanese sun, talking about symbolisms) and comes to modern day.

At this point you have no idea what you're talking about. Every piece of land that had any connection to a historic group has a right to it.

I agree on Bosnia. I actually agree on Serbia also. And yes I’m American, though living in Europe. But like many Americans I don’t like our country mendling with other peoples business and trying to influence stuff on different continents, so I do hope the EU stands up to the US (now under Trump who dislikes the EU) would be a good time. A strong competition between Western powers would keep them relevent and Europe if it doesn’t stand up for it’s own policies will soon become irrelevent with the new emerging powers. I guess the EU is starting to implement it’s own policies and stand up to the US. The Iran sanction debacle was a start, so this might happen. As for being a foothold for China, I’m not sure that would be good for any country, as we’ve dealt with the US as a superpower and with the USSR, but both were actually more normal in many aspects than the communist-capitalist China with so much people that our nations seem insignificant and with weird laws.

That would be a very nice scenario which would make a lot of people happy. I hope it will happen, despite not really believing that politicians would agree to it.

The ranking also doesn't say how it is calculated as for example arms exports don't seem to be weighted. A pistol seems to be worth as much as a tank.

Why that's good, I don't know. 

Additionally the Index disapproves of selling hazardous pesticides.

549,"NATO is one thing, but Serbia and all of former Yugoslavia in general joining the EU and Schengen would be the ultimate goal in a sense, with borderless travel in the majority of Europe, so it would be sad in my opinion if politics stopped the process. But I don’t know how far any of those politicians will budge. I don’t see the US supporting Serbia when Russia does, however I never know why the US supported Kosovo, as neighter supporting Albania or supporting countries with high Muslim populations was ever high on our agenda, but I guess the government had it’s reasons, probably to piss of Russia.

But I also wonder is there any way to fix the Balkans even if we forget about US, RUS and EU involvment. I’m talking about Kosovo, but also about disfunctional Bosnia and Herzegovina. Back in the older days, like after WW2, both borders changed and people were moved which stopped tensions in North Eastern Europe. But nowadays we don’t do that anymore. So no population movement, no border fixes, so is there any way to fix all those issues? I wonder what (if anything) would Serbia allow, what would Kosovo/Albania allow and what would BiH allow to stop being disfunctional. As some of these are nit really totally independent, like BiH with the forced 3 headed president system it gets even worse. I know for Serbs the preffered solution would be to return Kosovo to Serbia, but that is nit probable and to add Republika Srpska to Serbia, which, with internal borders in BiH seems impossible without population movement even with no politics involved. So is there even a way acceptable by all (or just by Serbs, as you might know that best) that would enable the whole region to join the EU and Schengen?",,/r/europe/comments/aizxgy/5_more_countries_expected_to_soon_revoke_kosovo/ees65r5/,JoseMikey,1548267184

I know that Europeans have a tendency to think themselves the center of the Universe, but we have a lot of issues we are dealing with. A little thing like Russia does not even compare to the issues we have to our West.

So, I can think of only two reasons for the US military to be in Europe:

1. Europe is incapable of defending itself.

667,"On the contrary. Is support groups like DiEM25 in the European Green Party. I myself am a passionate European Federalist and Green.

By saying that me saying that the EU is democratic that I am anti-europeanist is long part of the same problem that Europe has been facing - European integration for the sake of it. I hold my critique not because anti-europeanists support it - because I believe my argument to be true. Rather than having the correct integration procedures take place, many people (which I completely understand, but there is no admittance of it happening) rush to support European integration at every possible opportunity without contemplating it's effects. An example could be the Eurozone - the Euro is an economic union without a political one - such a condition guarantees a failed currency and austerity. The progressive left are always called Eurosceptics but they're not. It's normally because many (mostly centrists) paint the picture as black or white - you're either against integration or not. If you don't support this, you're not a Europeanist. If you criticise the EU, you're a Eurosceptic. This is an extremely toxic mindset that has put the development of the EU at risk.

I do not support a European technocracy - I fully support an executive that is accountable to the people. That needs to be the case for a federal Europe that has authority. It needs to be a democracy and the Parliament cannot act as an upper chamber. I am vehemently against an unelected, technocratic executive. The term 'specialist' is objective and a specialist excecutive's arguments will always come down left or right argument in the European Parliament. If we want a federal Europe then the responsibility of at the European level will increase - the legitimacy of an unelected technocratic exetutive just won't hold with most people I don't think. Especially when one is responsible for declaring an act of war. 

I support the Euro but it needs to be a federal currency. I support a European army but not without the authority of an elected European Government. I support a European Government but it needs to be democratically elected. Sending people to die for your country is a very serious issue - that's why whoever orders it to happen needs to do so with the authority and consent of the governed. I'm a Europeanist, just because I oppose the austerity agenda of the Troika or criticize the EU Parliament does not mean I support the narative of the far right - it is precisely the opposite. It is because I believe a well functioning EU is the key to preventing the far right gaining power and tearing Europe apart.

It's not national Parliaments that hold back sound integration but rather the lack of cross border parties to push for Europeanism on a continental level. The most united and organised forces in Europe are the far right.

The Spitzenkandidaten process is a much needed improvement and absolutely is step in the right direction. But, being ""approved"" by the EP is no where near the kind of sovereignty the EU Parliament needs. Although not a real Parliamentary democracy, I think it could definitely move to it if the right arguments are made. But we need a debate to take place, but since latest integration projects (such as the Euro) has failed, mainstream parties resist to talk about it to gain more votes, or even more, give in the xenophobia and try to reclaim far right voters by clamping down on migration and civil liberties. This always backfires, as their efforts undermine their previous positions (revealing them to by hypocrites) and it legitimises the far right. Examples of this can be seen all over the globe - Hillary Clinton, once a staunch opposer of Trump, now supports restrictions on migration to lure voters back to the Democratic Party.

The Comission consists of the EPP, S&amp;D &amp; ALDE groups - all three of which are very (Pro-EU) loosely defined and aligned and based in national politics. For example, the Labour Party in the UK does not play a very Europeanist role - it's MEP group is completely independent from the party, and yet, they have no loyalty to the S&amp;D group other than that they appreciate the fact they share the same group with parties that have similar routes. Manifestos for Europe are fought on a national level - an entirely contradictory concept, but is done as parties fear driving people away or forcing internal party divisions, putting party above people. That's why I like the Green movement and DiEM25 - they are truly cross border and transnational. European integration cannot happen on a country by country basis, or north Vs south, Germans Vs Greeks, but as Greens, Liberals, Social Democrats and Conservatives. The problem is not national Parliaments fearing integration - it is the lack of cross border parties seizing power in national Parliaments to push a common agenda for Europe.

For example, the Eurozone can't be reformed by Greece alone or by Germany alone. But, it can be reformed if a cross border party were to take power in each Parliament and force a federalist agenda. The problem is not along national lines - it's along party lines (or the lack/too many of them).

I understand the worry that small countries voices may not be represented, but there are more ways to do this other than the EU council. A Senate, like in the US, whilst I don't like the concept of it I think it would be a much better and fairer solution than 1 Council member per state.",,/r/europe/comments/aioy31/france_and_germany_sign_deal_that_contributes_to/eervj89/,BoIgoTtAfLeX,1548260069

I don't really have an answer, as I can see arguments for both sides.
Keep paying the debt and minimize debt - long slow climb up, minimizes disruption, will eventually get better.
Default - reset everything, allows you to start again and maybe a quicker recovery.

But the first can just give you anemic growth and no real improvement over a very long period leaving you in a sort of indentured servitude. And the second can cause a huge cost to people's quality of life in the immediate.

I don't really know what's better or worse, but I think it's worth pointing out that the people with more assets - who often get to make these decisions - have an incentive in the former because it hurts them the least.

829,"&gt;His intention is to only debunk the horrible laws forced upon the UK by the EU that the Vote Leave campaign took such offense to. 

But by doing that he hasn't debunked a'major Brexit fallacy', he has just misinterpreted it. 

The twitter poster defines the 'major Brexit fallacy' as Brexit supporters complaining about 'all them EU rules'. Fair enough this is a vague parody of a complain and is open to interpretation, but realistically there is absolutely no way that he can *only* be referring to the rather separate issue of legislation being imposed on the UK against its will. If he is doing so then he is being purposely disingenuous and misleading because there are two very separate issues relating to 'EU laws' in the UK.

One issue is that the UK now as an EU member passes domestic legislation and enacts EU-level legislation in accordance with EU norms and 'national obligation' as outlined in a quote in my previous post, and the other separate issue is that even while largely compliant within that structure that the UK has voted against legislation and that it has been imposed anyway. 

Many brexiteers may be enraged when EU law is enforced on the UK even after it has voted against it, and whether this has been right or wrong may depend on certain circumstances and variables as outlined in the twitter thread (albeit rather unprofessionally), but it has nothing to do with the dislike of swathes of EU-influenced laws that now form a great chunk of national law.

	Matteo Salvini has accused France of “stealing wealth” from African countries in the latest salvo in the spat between Paris and Rome over Europe’s migration crisis.

The head of the anti-migration League party on Tuesday followed the lead of the Five Star Movement, his coalition partner, in linking France’s colonial history in Africa to the influx of refugees into Europe.

“In Africa there are people who steal wealth from the population. France is obviously among them,” Mr Salvini said in an interview on Italian television. “In Libya France has no interest in stabilising the situation because it has oil interests opposite to those of Italy.”

He added: “Let us not take lessons from France which in recent years has rejected tens of thousands of migrants at the border [between France and Italy], including women and children.”

Mr Salvini’s comments marked a further deterioration in French-Italian relations since he and Mr di Maio formed a collation government last year.

Emmanuel Macron in 2017 likened the rise of populist politics across Europe to “leprosy”, while Mr Salvini has repeatedly attacked the French president for what he argues is a hypocritical approach to the flows of migrants from north Africa entering southern Europe.

On Monday France summoned Teresa Castaldo, Italy’s ambassador to Paris, after Mr Di Maio accused France of continuing to “colonise” African countries.

“If we have people who are leaving Africa now it’s because some European countries, France in particular, have never stopped colonising Africa,” Mr Di Maio said at a Five Star event on Saturday.

“If France didn’t have its African colonies, because that’s what they should be called, it would be the 15th largest world economy. Instead it’s among the first, exactly because of what it is doing in Africa.”

This month Mr Di Maio prompted a furious reaction from Paris by pledging his support to the gilets jaunes protesters, saying his party would provide them with assistance.

In response Nathalie Loiseau, the minister for European affairs, said Italy “should learn to clean up their own home”.

The worsening relations between Paris and Rome have also seen politicians within Mr Salvini’s League threaten to block the loan of paintings by Leonardo da Vinci to the Louvre in Paris for an exhibition celebrating the 500 years since the artist’s death.

Bu sayının ertesi yıl 300’e çıkarılması amaçlanıyordu. Bu 131 uçağın ise ancak yarısı çağdaş denebilecek nitelikteydi.** 1937’de Hava Kuvvetleri’ne şu uçaklar katılmıştır: Polonya’dan 40 avcı uçağı, ABD’den 20 Martin tipi bombardıman uçağı, Almanya’dan 10 Heinkel bombardıman uçağı, Birleşik Krallık’tan ise 2 Bristol bombardıman uçağı.

1151,"It is. Plenty of examples of ""fake news"". The recent story with the MAGA hata-wearing teenagers supposedly surrounding and mocking a Native American is a great example. A 3 minute clip from a nearly 2-hour long video was taken and spread far and wide, with the vast majority of the media widely misinterpreting the entire situation. There were 3 groups involved in the confrontation and it turns out that the only group not being racist pieces of shit were the white teens, but they were the ones blasted across pretty much all of mainstream and socia media for smiling, dancing, and chanting a school song.   


The media had the two hour long video. They had all the facts from the start. They shortened it down to 3 minutes and twisted what was actually happening to make the teens seem like the vulgar initiators of the conflict, when in reality they were the ones approached by both groups, they were the ones with racist remarks hurled at them, and the native american man decided to obnoxiously beat his drums in the teen's face.   


There are countless examples of the media overwhelming reporting a twisted version of the truth when it fits a particular narrative, and ignoring it when it doesn't. I remember another case in which an Arabian man-child got kicked off a plane, because passengers complained about him. It was reported in the media that he had been talking to his mother on a cellphone before the plane took off in Arabic, and that the others passengers were uncomfortable with him there. 

&amp;#x200B;

The reality, that wasn't reported, is that he is a Youtube prankster that frequently race-baits. He wasn't speaking to his mother on the phone, he was loudly counting down in Arabic - re recorded himself doing it and posted it to his channel, but that was still ignored by the media.  

&amp;#x200B;

There was another case of a U.S news stations faking a crime scene to report on it. Another where the anchors pretended to be in different parts of the country, but you can see the same exact cars pass each-other in the background. Another where CNN anchors pretended to be on a ship or in a country, when in reality it was a green-screen. 

&amp;#x200B;

The truth isn't reported and when it it is, no one listens. Go take a look at r/politics controversial post right now and you'll see that the most down-voted post are the ones reporting the truth about the white teens.

1172,"&gt;In one notable example, Bernard Monot, a member of the European Parliament and former member of the right-wing populist party National Rally, told his supporters in a since-deleted video that Macron was preparing to sell the French border region of Alsace—which Germany annexed in 1871 and then had to return to France after World War I—back to Germany. In the video, Monot claimed that “Alsace will return under German management, and the administrative language will be German,”—an assertion which France’s public broadcaster called “delirious“ (link in French). The video was viewed and shared by thousands of social media users before it was taken down.

The sad thing is, that this is all they read. Loads of these far-right/ultranationalist idiots get their 'news' solely from social media they follow. And nothing else. ""Cause all mass media are left-wing liars."" Deleting the video doesn't matter. The damage is already done. And that's what's counts. This lie is out there and there is no one to refute it.

I was talking to one of those shining examples the other day and I asked him when the last time was he bought an actual newspaper. He glared and me for a moment and started laughing. ""Newspaper? Why would I buy a newspaper? WE HAVE SOCIAL MEDIA NOW.""

1213,"Hah, very funny. I was wondering when she will talk bullshit's like this, 3 days after funeral of her husband. I think it's a new record. But, enough of this. Let's get to the facts. 
The prosecutor started an investigation against Adamowicz family in 2013 (when the PO ruled). The first allegations were made to Adamowicz and his wife at the beginning of 2015 (when PO ruled). When the PiS took power at the end of 2015, the prosecutor continued the investigation, which is obviously clear. From what I know, the prosecutor recently supplemented the charges against Paweł Adamowicz and his wife at the beginning of 2018. Both of them were accused of concealing money in tax returns in 2011-2012 (hundreds of thousands PLN)
Now let's go to the interview of Mrs. Adamowicz. She said her husband had told her what to do when the police or other secret services would arrive at their home at the morning. Who is behaving like this? Who is afraid of the police? Honest, innocent people who have nothing to hide?
Watch this interview and see her body language. Is this how the grieving wife, who lost her husband a week ago, is behaving? He goes to television and tells such things? 
This interview is nothing but an ""escaping forward"". When the prosecutor's office decides to add further charges or even arrest her, she will probably say that the PiS killed her husband and now they want to finish her off.
For me personally, it's pathetic. You know what Mrs. Adamowicz said during the funeral, which took place three days ago? ""Please, do not use this tragedy for political purposes."" And what is she doing right now? 
Here I found information about the allegations against Paweł Adamowicz and his wife;

I expect more trade wars and more tariffs in the future, even beyond Trump.

Europe honestly needed a kick up its behind to clean up its act. Defence is a contentious issue among states, and with NATO and the Cold War there was never much urgency to the question. The problem is that they tried to incorporate it all into the European Union, including Schengen. The EU is a neoliberal organisation at its core, it is fundamentally unequipped to deal with defence and security. This has been proven again and again. It's also very unwise to push European integration any further at the moment. The 90s and 2000s were contentious enough. The EU needs some time to come into its own right now, it can't pretend to be the United States of Europe because that is fundamentally not how European cooperation works. The only time Europe was united against one cause was against Islam, and I don't see the EU take on the role of 'defending Christendom' any time soon, thank god.

We need a separate European defence network. NATO is not sufficient, the EU is not sufficient. If some countries choose to opt out (looking at Ireland, Austria, Eastern Europe) that's fine. It's a start. Maybe we can start asserting ourselves in new ways. Multi-polar defence and regionalism better reflects the world of today.

1338,"The euro area is back on the brink of recession

&amp;#x200B;

IT BEGAN AS a joke: the Twitter hashtag #euroboom tacked on to news of any sign, no matter how faint, of a euro-area recovery. By 2017, when French, German and even Spanish GDP grew by more than 2%, it seemed to describe a real phenomenon. Alas, all too quickly #euroboom has turned to #eurogloom. GDP data scheduled for release later this month are likely to confirm that in the final three months of 2018 Italy’s economy contracted for a second consecutive quarter, satisfying one of the technical definitions of a recession. Germany appears to have escaped recession, but only just. The euro area, formed in January 1999, may pass its anniversary on the brink of another downturn.

&amp;#x200B;

The euro has been an economic fiasco. GDP growth in the euro area has lagged behind that in other advanced economies, and in the European Union as a whole, throughout its life—before the financial crisis, during the global recession and its euro-area encore, and even during the recent #euroboom. Perhaps the area would have done as badly without the single currency. But attempts to estimate euro-zone performance relative to a counterfactual world sans euro suggest not. The past decade has been especially brutal. A list of the world’s worst performers in terms of real GDP per person since 2008 contains places suffering geopolitical meltdowns—plus the euro-area periphery. Greece has been outgrown by Sudan and Ukraine. Cyprus and Italy have been beaten by Brazil and Iran; France and the Netherlands by Britain.

&amp;#x200B;

And now the euro area begins its third decade, a new slump looming. It has many causes. German car production slowed as firms worked to meet new emissions standards. Italy’s economy wobbled as its new populist leaders battled with Brussels, spooking markets. Protests threw a wrench in the gears of the French economy. China’s slowdown and straitened global financial conditions took a toll. But although the specific forces dragging down euro-area growth might not have been foreseeable two or three years ago, an eventual return to gloomy form should have been.

&amp;#x200B;

The euro zone’s economies labour under plenty of structural hindrances to growth. But since 2008 their main constraint has been weak demand. After the global crisis, growth briefly revived only to swoon again because of institutional weaknesses. Investors fretted that the European Central Bank (ECB) would not stand behind nationally issued bonds or deposits at nationally insured banks, and panicked accordingly. Fear subsided as European leaders moved grudgingly to create supranational stabilisation mechanisms, allowing the ECB to promise to support national bonds and banks. Growth remained weak, however, despite the ECB’s decision in 2015 to begin an open-ended programme of stimulative bond purchases, like those started elsewhere long before.

&amp;#x200B;

Then came the #euroboom. If reform and ECB action cleared away obstacles to growth, it was demand imported from abroad that rescued the euro area from its doldrums. From 2013 to 2016 net exports contributed substantially to growth; the euro area’s current-account surplus leapt from roughly 1% of GDP to nearly 4%. As a recovery in export industries reduced unemployment, domestic demand played a bigger part in boosting growth. In 2017 and the first half of 2018, consumption contributed more than two percentage points to growth in GDP. Investment chipped in another percentage point. The euro area was lucky. Had China’s government not flooded its economy with stimulus, or had America not supported global production by running vast trade deficits, then the boost to demand needed to put Europeans back to work, and get them spending again, might never have materialised.

&amp;#x200B;

That is because Europe’s crisis-era reforms also included draconian measures to limit government borrowing. The price of German support for crisis-addled economies was a revision to the “stability and growth pact”, which is intended to keep budgets in line. The new fiscal compact struck in 2012 requires governments to keep net borrowing to no more than 3% of GDP. Though that may not seem particularly onerous, it also requires them to maintain a structural budget deficit (adjusted to take account of the business cycle) of no more than 1% of GDP if debt is “significantly” below 60% of GDP, and no more than 0.5% of GDP if debt is above that level. Governments with debt above 60% must also take steps to bring it back below that threshold; those approaching it can no doubt expect stern warnings. Countries in egregious violation of these rules are subject to penalties. In Italy, which has public debt of around 130% of GDP, populists were carried into office by frustration with the status quo, but cowed into budget sobriety last year after the EU threatened to impose such penalties.

&amp;#x200B;

\#eurodoom

In effect, Europe has denied governments the ability to use their budgets to boost demand. These fiscal shackles would be less worrying if the ECB were better positioned to boost private spending by easing monetary policy. But its effective interest rate is already negative. The slowdown in 2018 came despite the ECB asset purchases continuing, albeit more slowly than in 2016 and 2017. Foreign spending could keep the euro-area economic engine turning over. But it is fickle, as the currency bloc is learning. It was only a matter of time until an ill wind caused the euro area’s sails to slacken, exposing its inability to maintain domestic demand without external help. The shift from boom to gloom was inevitable.

&amp;#x200B;

It need not be permanent. Europe could loosen its fiscal restraints. Better still, it could make use of its combined fiscal potential by mutualising some debt and creating a euro-area budget big enough to offer meaningful stimulus. These reforms would require a big shift in the balance of power and thinking within Europe. Such shifts have occurred before, in the throes of crisis. But if the past ten years of #eurogloom did not demonstrate the pressing need to maintain an array of demand-boosting tools, it is difficult—and frightening—to contemplate what ultimately will.

It's deeper than that. Reagan represented all the qualities of America that Europe loathes, long before he ""won the Cold War"". Here's a smooth-talking movie star with an unflinching belief in voodoo capitalism, like is this guy even for real? I honestly still find it hard to believe Reagan wasn't a massive phony, he just comes off as a snake-oil salesman to me. The same is true for Bush and Trump in different ways. They're also all overtly nationalist, something Europeans feel understandably conflicted about.

Reagan didn't win the Cold War any more than Kennedy did. The Soviet system simply collapsed in on itself: years of Stalinist terror had hollowed out the Party to the extent that a Gorbachev was able to become the leader. The communist empire fell the moment he gave the people any kind of movement, that's how fragile it was.

1395,"My country has the second largest population of them in the world, over one million of them and counting as they flee from shitty old world attitudes; they live among us more or less invisibly and the average person would think of the term 'Gypsy' in much the same way as they would 'leprechaun'. That's because the antiziganism in the US has been cranked way, *way* down relative to Europe for many many decades, allowing them to actually get on with their lives in some peace for several sustained generations.

Of course the ones in Europe are going to have social problems, that's all but been guaranteed by the way people have gone about treating them. For instance, one 'brilliant' solution thought up by anyone from 18th century monarchs to modern politicians- why don't we take away the kids from their parents, raise them in a separate school far away where we can teach them to be proper Christians and speakers of the majority language with some systematically abuse, especially if they show any signs of their culture? As the US would later find with boarding schools for Native Americans, where we sought to ""Kill the Indian &amp; save the man"", this leads to disaster; the graduates of such programs for some reason would not want to integrate with the society that had made their childhood a hell, and the communities began to see school as a place where children are stolen away to be indoctrinated in a foreign culture, not a place where one gets advancement and useful knowledge. Generations of this results in a lingering cultural disdain for education, which is hard to break even in the best of circumstances; when it's obvious that your schools in even modern era are substandard, grouping you with the mentally handicapped to save money while technically being able to claim that you're getting an education, does that look like you're being set up with tools and knowledge for success in life, the sort of place you should apply yourself with? That's not the only nor anywhere near the worst wound inflicted on Romani people by their history in Europe and it already sets them back so far.

The people aren't bad, but the hate and venom for them has withered their opportunities to branch out even as advances in technology made many of their prior competitive strengths collapse; so what are they left with?  I'm not saying you have to like them (the US benefits a great deal from accepting the people the other nations of the world despise) but don't claim that you're 'against prejudice' when you freely engage in it.",,/r/europe/comments/aidfyq/distribution_of_the_roma_people_in_europe_in_2007/eeqri71/,sparkling_uranium,1548214350

Without standardized SOPs, logistics, communication protocols, or even an official language an attempt at a unified effort would be a complete clusterfuck well long enough for a Russian offensive to make considerable gains.

Barring nukes and US intervention Russia would probably get as far West as Warsaw before the EU would be able to start mounting a credible and cohesive defense. And that's not even getting into the fact that a sizable chunk of Europeans don't want to honor Article 5 of NATO and could well waste plenty of time wringing their hands and hoping the Russians would be satisfied with reclaiming the Eastern Bloc.

If you need proof of how unprepared the EU is for an attack on it's home soil, when France (now the largest spender on defense in the EU) started it's air campaign against Libya it exhausted it's reserves of bombs and had to ask the US for logistical assistance. Think about that. This was a country that had absolutely no air threat capabilities or an air force that could conceivably fly against France, and still France couldn't carry out it's mission without American assistance.

1445,"&gt;You are correct that it is the company that has generated the profits, not Bezos, but it is also the company that decides to make the dividend payments to all of the shareholders. 

It's the company *management* that decided that, not the company as a whole. And as it happens, that management is appointed *by* the shareholders. So it should not be surprising at all that they decide to give all the profit to the shareholders. That's the fundamental asymmetry: a company can't exist without either capital or labor, and yet it's capital who is the boss by default.

&gt;Bezos doesn't get preferential treatment just because he is the founder, he gets the exact same dividend payment per stock than anyone else.

What is nonsense is that you pretend it's only because of the parties, and not the presidents actions and words.

&gt;This is the larger problem.

The larger problem is that Americans take those number without understanding what kind of troops are in those countries, and why they are there. Comparing the US presence in Germany with the one in Japan and South Korea is ridiculous. But lets go through it:

The US is in Japan and South Korea as a direct, defensive force; that includes extensive fleets and troop concentrations, as well as heavy weaponry. It is directly to protect those countries against China.

Otoh, in Germany? As far as I know, there aren't any US armored regiments or notable troop concentrations in Germany, and the same was true for the entirety of europe. Only in the last year of his presidency did Obama even send tanks to Poland, shaken up by the Ukraine invasion; before that, the US presence in europe was absolute minimum.

Troops that are in Germany are NOT there for defensive purposes. Germany is a big logistics hub for the US military, it's a gate to the middle east, as well as a connection point to the rest of europe, Drone strikes had been controlled from Germany, and the US also has military hospitals there. 

&amp;#x200B;

That is why so much money goes into facilities in Germany, it is not for the defence of the country; Germany has no natural opponents and the US didn't need to defend it against anyone since the end of the Cold War. It is for the benefit of the US operations, including their adventures in the middle east, which is very different from Japan and SK, where US troops are stationed to risk their lives in case of a major conflict that is threatening the entire region.",Lower Saxony (Germany),/r/europe/comments/aioy31/france_and_germany_sign_deal_that_contributes_to/eeq1r2x/,reymt,1548195008

Here you go, this is unbiased: [*free from bias

&gt; I never heard of people whom want to edit wikipedia in such ways that it would benefit ther case in political debates

&gt; Also 444 operats on donations and ads, so by your thinking, that can be controlled with donations?

Yes, if those donations are cause for a certain perspective to be favoured in their work then that would indeed be a bias. I don't know exactly how 444 operates and it doesn't matter since I'm not asking about any Hungarian sources.

&gt; But still, you didn't answer my question. Show me one! Enlighten me!

Alright, since you really seem to have no clue what an unbiased source is supposed to be: a source that has proven to have no stake whatsoever in painting either Hungary, Soros or Orban in a certain light. A source that aims to lay out the objective facts about the ties of those three subjects. I don't know which *specific* source that would be, otherwise I would not be asking this question. You claim to be able to help.

Give me a source of aforementioned objectivity that shows that Soros is the danger to Hungary that Viktor Orban presents him to be.

1601,"&gt; Truth really only is Turks are extremely afraid of Kurdish independence as it would also promote insurgencies from other minorities and have made it one of their top priorities not to let their nationalistic views be messed with.

&gt; Turkey saw no need for a 30km security zone around their borders when ISIS was ravaging Afrin, but they suddenly seemed concerned with it when Daesh were pushed out of the area.

Turkey is more afraid of Kurdish millitants than ISIS because IS never had the power and courage to attempt direct invasion into Turkish territory, and if they did attempt that they would be quickly eliminated because Turkey has one of the strongest millitaries in the world along with NATO's article 5, unlike disfunctional Iraqi and Syrian armies that lost a lot of land to jihadists. Since IS doesn't have much supporters within Turkey nor can they directly attack it they couldn't present that much of a threat, Kurdish millitants, on the other hand, have millions of people that they can potentially recruit within Turkey along with thousands of active members already in the country, and the prospect of them having huge presence on Turkish borders to launch attacks from there and house millitants is a huge problem. After all ISIS can blow up a bomb or two and kill 5, 10, 15, 50 people, but Kurdish millitants can break away a third of country's population, land and natural resources or fight a guerilla war for decades to come.",,/r/europe/comments/aimsrm/in_1933_hitler_threatened_ataturk_and_demanded/eepr35f/,ereniwe,1548187641

**The euro area is back on the brink of recession**

After two decades of underperformance, that should not be surprising

Business and finance

Jan 22nd 2019

IT BEGAN AS a joke: the Twitter hashtag #euroboom tacked on to news of any sign, no matter how faint, of a euro-area recovery. By 2017, when French, German and even Spanish GDP grew by more than 2%, it seemed to describe a real phenomenon. Alas, all too quickly #euroboom has turned to #eurogloom. GDP data scheduled for release later this month are likely to confirm that in the final three months of 2018 Italy’s economy contracted for a second consecutive quarter, satisfying one of the technical definitions of a recession. Germany appears to have escaped recession, but only just. The euro area, formed in January 1999, may pass its anniversary on the brink of another downturn.

The euro has been an economic fiasco. GDP growth in the euro area has lagged behind that in other advanced economies, and in the European Union as a whole, throughout its life—before the financial crisis, during the global recession and its euro-area encore, and even during the recent #euroboom. Perhaps the area would have done as badly without the single currency. But attempts to estimate euro-zone performance relative to a counterfactual world sans euro suggest not. The past decade has been especially brutal. A list of the world’s worst performers in terms of real GDP per person since 2008 contains places suffering geopolitical meltdowns—plus the euro-area periphery. Greece has been outgrown by Sudan and Ukraine. Cyprus and Italy have been beaten by Brazil and Iran; France and the Netherlands by Britain.

And now the euro area begins its third decade, a new slump looming. It has many causes. German car production slowed as firms worked to meet new emissions standards. Italy’s economy wobbled as its new populist leaders battled with Brussels, spooking markets. Protests threw a wrench in the gears of the French economy. China’s slowdown and straitened global financial conditions took a toll. But although the specific forces dragging down euro-area growth might not have been foreseeable two or three years ago, an eventual return to gloomy form should have been.

The euro zone’s economies labour under plenty of structural hindrances to growth. But since 2008 their main constraint has been weak demand. After the global crisis, growth briefly revived only to swoon again because of institutional weaknesses. Investors fretted that the European Central Bank (ECB) would not stand behind nationally issued bonds or deposits at nationally insured banks, and panicked accordingly. Fear subsided as European leaders moved grudgingly to create supranational stabilisation mechanisms, allowing the ECB to promise to support national bonds and banks. Growth remained weak, however, despite the ECB’s decision in 2015 to begin an open-ended programme of stimulative bond purchases, like those started elsewhere long before.

Then came the #euroboom. If reform and ECB action cleared away obstacles to growth, it was demand imported from abroad that rescued the euro area from its doldrums. From 2013 to 2016 net exports contributed substantially to growth; the euro area’s current-account surplus leapt from roughly 1% of GDP to nearly 4%. As a recovery in export industries reduced unemployment, domestic demand played a bigger part in boosting growth. In 2017 and the first half of 2018, consumption contributed more than two percentage points to growth in GDP. Investment chipped in another percentage point. The euro area was lucky. Had China’s government not flooded its economy with stimulus, or had America not supported global production by running vast trade deficits, then the boost to demand needed to put Europeans back to work, and get them spending again, might never have materialised.

That is because Europe’s crisis-era reforms also included draconian measures to limit government borrowing. The price of German support for crisis-addled economies was a revision to the “stability and growth pact”, which is intended to keep budgets in line. The new fiscal compact struck in 2012 requires governments to keep net borrowing to no more than 3% of GDP. Though that may not seem particularly onerous, it also requires them to maintain a structural budget deficit (adjusted to take account of the business cycle) of no more than 1% of GDP if debt is “significantly” below 60% of GDP, and no more than 0.5% of GDP if debt is above that level. Governments with debt above 60% must also take steps to bring it back below that threshold; those approaching it can no doubt expect stern warnings. Countries in egregious violation of these rules are subject to penalties. In Italy, which has public debt of around 130% of GDP, populists were carried into office by frustration with the status quo, but cowed into budget sobriety last year after the EU threatened to impose such penalties.

#eurodoom
In effect, Europe has denied governments the ability to use their budgets to boost demand. These fiscal shackles would be less worrying if the ECB were better positioned to boost private spending by easing monetary policy. But its effective interest rate is already negative. The slowdown in 2018 came despite the ECB asset purchases continuing, albeit more slowly than in 2016 and 2017. Foreign spending could keep the euro-area economic engine turning over. But it is fickle, as the currency bloc is learning. It was only a matter of time until an ill wind caused the euro area’s sails to slacken, exposing its inability to maintain domestic demand without external help. The shift from boom to gloom was inevitable.

It need not be permanent. Europe could loosen its fiscal restraints. Better still, it could make use of its combined fiscal potential by mutualising some debt and creating a euro-area budget big enough to offer meaningful stimulus. These reforms would require a big shift in the balance of power and thinking within Europe. Such shifts have occurred before, in the throes of crisis. But if the past ten years of #eurogloom did not demonstrate the pressing need to maintain an array of demand-boosting tools, it is difficult—and frightening—to contemplate what ultimately will.",England,/r/europe/comments/aiqfwl/the_euro_area_is_back_on_the_brink_of_recession/eeprvxj/,keef2000,1548188194

To put it very simple: there are two forms of cooperation in the EU: areas where parliament is involved and areas where it isn't.
On matters related to foreign policy, for example, parliament has basically no say (except from the budget).
An EU army, as it is planned at the moment, would basically be an army consisting of members of national armies and decisions would be taken jointly by national governments. I don't see what your problem is with that.

Sanctions against its own members are basically a form of law enforcement, albeit a very weak one as the process of enforcing these sanctions has high bars: all other member states must agree. Also it's just possible if a member state breaches fundamental values of the EU, such as the rule of law or democracy. So it is in fact a safeguard for liberal values.

1938,"It didn't, and doesn't reflect either government's reasoning for signing the treaty today either. To take some hot air out of this entire discussion: the treaty is, broadly speaking, an *addendum* to the 50+ year old Elysée treaty. Its main purpose is to flesh-out the latter and provide the Franco-German relationship with a more articulated vision. For example, this includes a written-down committment towards creating a Franco-German economic zone with harmonised laws even in areas where the EU is struggling to find a consensus. 

In this, it mostly formalises aspects of the relationship which have already been true for years. There are some truly new developments as well, both on the national and regional level. Going into the details would be too involved right now, but I recommend anyone who can to read the actual treaty text.

One should furthermore mention that the Treaty of Aachen (the treaty in question) is only one of two important treaties. The other one a treaty between the French and German national parliaments, institutionalising parliamentary cooperation. This is necessary if France and Germany wish to formulate the laws required e.g. for establishing a closer economic union.

Thus we now have a high-level political vision for the future Franco-German relationship, several institution guiding this (e.g. Franco-German security council, Franco-German economics board), as well as deepened and institutional cooperation between the national parliaments necessary to formulate laws concerning Franco-German cooperation. The last bit is a ""project list"" which is exactly what it say on the label, namely a list of projects that are supposed to help move France and Germany in the direction they agreed upon in the Treaty of Aachen.",EU nation: /r/acteuropa,/r/europe/comments/ailg1y/new_francegermany_treaty_aims_to_revive_eu/eeowuh1/,DFractalH,1548166340

The ""of people"" bit is a bit of a convention born out of a more restrictive legal reality: You are only allowed to be unregistered in a host country for 3 months, after which you are legally required to sign up for residency with the understanding of trying to find a job or already having found one. The 3 months is the time needed to arrange all of that.

But, over time this evolved into the ""freedom of movement of people"" as countries eased the requirements and abuses were limited. Some occasionally have enforced the strict letter of the law, like Belgium, which is always possible and at the leasure of the host country,

But the UK doesn't just have a problem with the ""freedom of movement of people"", it has a problem with the ""freedom of movement of workers"" as well, since it dislikes providing the social support expected of workers to ""bloody foreigners"", as well as there being a significant ""they dun tuk r jobs"" rethoric going on.",,/r/europe/comments/aiml7j/eu_should_just_offer_the_uk_temporary_membership/eeox6h6/,InitialEstablishment,1548166599

Only a minority will get what they want, currently the hard Brexiteers, and the vast majority will face a future that they do not want. How is that cohesive?

If May is so concerned about the social cohesion, she should end this shit show and present a law to initiate a new Brexit debate. A debate that first discusses the available scenarios and then votes between these scenarios, ideally with a requirement for a qualified majority. Or in other words: You first have to reach social cohesion before you can do things that will significantly change the lives of 60 million people.

Plus, we basically know nothing (comparatively) about how the world works, to unmistakably claim that such a complex butterfly effect is caused by this or by that, it's just foolish and arrogant. And last, even if climate change was caused by humans, the cause is always pointed out to be fossil fuels, which have never ever been free of controversy from a geopolitical standpoint, so in that regard when it's about fossil fuels I don't believe anything I hear. And so far I haven't seen any actions taken that don't pertain to fossil fuels, but if we claim human activity is causing climate change we can't possibly say everything is perfect except fossil fuels, we do a lot of shit that is damaging the planet. Greenpeace and organizations like that are laughed at and have always been laughed at because they are seen as leftist and idealistic, now suddenly everybody cares about climate change. When politicians and all the other climate change evangelists are gonna care equal amounts about the rest of stuff Greenpeace and other environmental organizations have complained about for years (in the past before this trend), then I'll believe them.

There are Muslims who say their religion is persecuted and thus starting doing stupid things(one of my best friends at school went this way), there are plenty of Muslims who refuse to condemn extremists who do deplorable acts, there are Muslims who become radicalised, there are Muslims who vindicate inexcusable behaviour by quoting the Qu’ran(wrongly), and there are those who are just out right dickheads who would be that way regardless of religion. 


In general though I feel the people of the religion don’t stop bad behaviour and as a community they don’t condemn it enough possibly in relation to loose connections to Quran quotes or brain washing when younger. They don’t openly encourage bad actions but they turn a wilful blind eye to a lot of goings on and therefore it encourages more actions like grooming. There are those who are incredibly good people, such as hearing about Muslims feeding and helping Americans during the government close down, but proportionately, in the uk, it seems the number of serious issues with Muslims such as grooming, rape, actively harassing and trying to convert non Muslims, joining Islamic military organisations such as IS is worryingly high thus I use the word Muslims.

First, New Caledonia had a referendum last year and a large majority voted against independence. If it is their wish to be French, it seems to me that it would be *more* disrespectful not to say that they are French.

Second, I live in Alsace, which has been part of France for roughly the same amount of time as most of its oversea territories; and our culture there is also vastly different from what you might find in other parts of France. Why would it be more 'rightful' for us to consider ourselves French and not for them?

Without NS2 Russia cant cut off CEE without cutting off Germany as well, which as previously pointed out, they cant afford to do so. With NS2, they can. That is why it changes a lot for CEE countries, it creates the risk of Russia using gas as a weapon.

[https://britishbusinessenergy.co.uk/europe-natural-gas-network/](https://britishbusinessenergy.co.uk/europe-natural-gas-network/)

Look at the map, where are the pipelines that supply the 3 Baltic States? As you might notice, they get their supply via branches in Belarus or directly from Russia. So, with the help of Belarus, Russia can right now cut of their supply. If Belarus does not help, it can only cut of the entire pipeline reducing the supply to Europe by half. NordStream doesn't positively or negatively impact this at all.

You will also see the 3 primary routes that supply Europe. The one going through Ukraine will be shut down. So again, Nordstream 1+2 changes nothing for any of the European countries besides Ukraine. And that was the goal after all.

So while we own the same amount in principle, the cost of servicing those loans has dropped.

Interesting, good news.

&gt; we still spend around €6B per year servicing this debt, (imagine what we could do for the housing and health crisis with an extra €6B in revenue to work with)

It seems like it's just a case of pedophiles using that job to get to be around children and then taking advantage of them when they're alone with them. 

What makes the church itself look bad is that they apparently care more about their reputation than about doing the right thing and simply reporting the priests. But at least that does show that the church is aware of it being a bad thing since they realize what it might do to their reputation.

When you read about some of these ""Asian cases"" it's fucking horrifying since it seems like it's like common knowledge and large parts of those societies actively hide it, see nothing wrong with it or even take part in it themselves.

Obviously pedophiles have always existed but to have it organized like that is fucking rare, or at least it used to be.

2608,"&gt; Actually we've been quite lucky here unlike the shengen border or at international airports, peoples credentials don't need to be checked when they cross the border between the UK and Ireland even in the event of no-deal. 

Not on their passports, their vehicles. For cigarettes, alcohol and other such high tarrif items that usually get caught and tarrifed on exterior EU borders.

Christ, it's like you're just picking up keywords and looking up answers in some Brexit brochure flow chart.

&gt;Add in a FTA that reduces the number of checks that need to be performed as well eliminating many of the tariffs.

No FTA will ever reduce the number of checks, because the goods might not be tarriffed but they still damn need to be checked to make sure they are not tarrifed goods. Fairly obvious really.

&gt;Then factor in that at most ports in the EU less than 5 % of containers arriving from outside are physically inspected. So even if the technology based system only inspects 50% of goods crossing smugglers would still be better off using containers. 

They're only checked 5% of the time because it's really hard for your average smuggler to use the container system. 

&gt; Even with full customs posts they can move goods across the fields at night, the key is to make sure the longer they do it and the more goods they move the more likely it is they will get caught. 

Well don't worry, I am sure your fancy CCTVs will capture their license plates as the walk across the coutry paths.

&gt;But all the different parts are interconnected, which is why you can't negotiate one part without some idea of what the others will be.

2613,"&gt; But apparently Pointing out that this shit has been rife in the Catholic church and elsewhere for decades is whataboutism? Get fucking real.

Catholic priests molest congregation members from within their community. Therefore it's a community issue. Every community as you are, well, trying to point out, as its fair share. Every community can and should work as a community to stamp out their community abuses.

These gangs seek out vulnerable girls from *outside* their community. They are consistently from one community, seeking out girls from another. There's more than enough evidence that this preying on out-of-community girls is racially charged, i.e. that such girls are 'fair game' for being outside the community, and thus lesser.

My closest friends are Muslim men. They went to a local mosque that had a speaker who outright told these young boys (at the time) kuffar girls were fair game, do what you want, if they get pregnant the baby will end up being brought up Muslim, if you marry them, they'll have to revert.

This isn't just something about whites. A few years back there was an issue at the University of East London where Muslim students were dating Hindu girls, leaning on them to revert for them, distance themselves from their families, and then ditching them.

We all know extremist preachers are going into mosques, funded by countries whose records we all deplore, and preaching awful messages, which mosques have to accept as they're funding comes from those countries.

This has nothing to do with Muslim Britons, nor Islam, and everything to do with a poison that's being poured in from abroad, from deeply misogynistic preachers who are telling young impressionable men women from outside their community are fair game.

The entire reason this is a huge and visceral issue is because it's men from a community preying on women and girls from other communities. Yes, we all need to tackle community abuse, this is seen as bigger because it's communities being abused by others.

If it turned out in any reasonably large city, white men were forming gangs to groom and rape black girls, and month after month they were being exposed, having long been ignored by the police, it would be national news. Because it's men from one community thinking another's girls are meat.

If racists are able to make hay from the issue it's only because people like you are so desperate to shut down stating the obvious with a false equivalence ie Catholic priests.

2635,"&gt; FYI this is coming from an American who has been to all these places. I like to travel!

Me too, but I'm not an American! So NYC and North Carolina are the only places I've been to any length of time (as in, not just crossing the Virginia or New Jersey border to go somewhere else). Study abroad semester. That's why I know just about about NC not to mention it.

&gt; Weirdly, New York City (metro area) has a lot more people than New York State, because as you noted the metro spills across state lines. Not just into New Jersey, but also Connecticut and even a small chunk of NE Pennsylvania (according to some definitions). The people of northern NJ and western CT, both densely populated urban/suburban areas, outnumber everyone in upstate NY.

Yeah, I noticed that while driving from Newark to Manhattan... I was thinking of making a map where I redistribute all the states to be roughly equal in size and culture (so 50 times 6.5 million) but New York was one of the places that threw a wrench into that idea. And the non-contiguous parts of the US (Pacific+Alaska) don't come close to making 6 million.

Really, I just can't understand why you can't just throw North and South Dakota together to keep things a little more equal on the senatorial front, it's like people would barely even notice and there's so few between them! But then, Malta and Cyprus get a set in the European Council right along France and Germany, so maybe I shouldn't complain...

&gt; Keep in mind that NYC is a huge, sprawling place; it's not just Manhattan (aka that place with the skyscrapers and subways). The other four boroughs - Bronx, Queens, Brooklyn, and Staten Island - are also officially part of the city. And anywhere within commuting distance (about ~1 hour drive) of any of those places is part of the metro area. That includes a lot of smaller cities in neighboring states like Newark, Stamford, and Jersey City.

Hey, I know that! I went to Queens, visiting Flushing Meadows because I'm fascinated by the World Fairs held there. It was a nice rest from Manhattan (I even didn't have the time to visit Central Park). It's weirdly doable actually -- I'm not good with direct contact to the summer sun, but the skyscrapers are all so high the ground is cast in a semi-permanent shade anyway. And to think part of the Financial District was once a Dutch outpost.

&gt; Georgia has rural areas and small cities, but then it also has Atlanta, a major city that has about half of the entire state population (5.5 mil in the metro area). Atlanta is an interesting place - culturally, IMO, it feels a lot more like NYC or Chicago than ""the South."" It's a large, modern, liberal city with a significant minority of its population from outside the South (other parts of the US or foreign). It's a sharp contrast with the rural areas just a few miles away.

Atlanta is one of those places you never hear about, like Houston. And it still doesn't explain why so goddamn many people live in Florida. You don't send ALL your elders there, right?

&gt; Ohio is an interesting case. It has a lot of people and a lot of cities. It has rural farming areas, sure, but you can't get much more than an hour's drive from any large city. Almost everyone in the state is technically in the metro area of one city or another. It just doesn't have a single hub like Atlanta or NYC. Instead people are split between a bunch of mid-sized metros that you may not have heard of, with 1-3 mil people each (Cincinnati, Columbus, Cleveland, Toledo).

Those names ring a bell, even if I couldn't think of one thing about them. Also, I thinking of Iowa earlier.

&gt; It just might not be a huge internationally-known city (with a few exceptions like Chicago, Detroit, Toronto). It's a bit like Germany, I suppose? It's polycentric.

You try the Ruhr area.

The stories from your own dump are equally cherry-picked but lacking something crucial - they're intra-community abuse. It's Catholics abusing Catholics.

Every community has abuse within the community. Very few communities abuse other communities methodically in such a way as all these 'grooming gangs' do.

If you can't see that the reason these stories end up huge is because they are about deeply damaging acts against communities then, you are missing the point. If these were straight up attacks on Muslims, then cases of imams having abused Muslim kids in their care would be added too. They're not.

They're liberal, both politically and sexually, they aren't deeply religious, their women go around uncovered. And they're richer and happier than you.

2722,"Conscript armies are actually superior to professional armies, they're just significantly more expensive. In a professional army you usually don't have enough people signing up, and so are forced to take everyone, including for instance men with poor eyesight, or who don't pass psychology tests flawlessly. A conscript army on the other hand grabs every man from a generation, tests and trains them, and can then assign the best men in an age group. Some, like the Swedish army, outright reject the poorer recruits, while some, like the Finnish army, simply assign them to less elite units and in case of war would deploy them with that in mind.  
  
A conscript army isn't some meme like the 40k flashlight brigades, it's a very wide fighting force with elite units that definitively outclass the performance of professional armies.  
  
In 1973 the British and Swedish conducted a joint test of a new tank, and the difference in quality of men was stunning. Sweden had a conscript army, UK a professional army.
&gt;At the end of the gunnery training, there were two tests with a gun camera, one against a fixed target and one against a moving one, as per usual Swedish standard. The results were bad. The first time these results may possibly be explained by the gunners not taking the trial seriously, but even after they had evaluated their own results and re-did the test the results were very bad. It is possible that more training could have improved the results somewhat, but the more likely explanation is that a large portion of the British gunners simply weren’t suited to their job as gunners. In some cases, problems with bad eyesight were apparent. It should be noted that British tank personnel is not tested in the same way as Swedish personnel before being assigned as tank gunners.  

&gt;Both the methods the tank crews used for engaging targets and their aiming skills were unacceptable and clearly worse than that of the average Swedish crew.  
  
What happened here was, Swedish conscripts assigned to tank units were the crème de la crème of their generation. The British tank crews were composed of whoever showed up for training that day.

We have to take the severity of the crimes into context. Comparing the IRA (a terrorist group) to genocidal Serb forces directed by the central government is a joke. The IRA was not the Irish army.

Why should Ireland lose territory for the actions of a group that its own government was against?

2793,"&gt; I realized only yesterday how small the American population actually is, comapred to what I'm used to (the Netherlands, 17 million people versus more than 328 million in a country 227 times its size). The average American state (say, Indiana) contains around 6.5 million inhabitants, whereas the average European state contains around 14.5 million (which is about halfway between the Netherlands and Belgium), though it's possible I may have included Asian Russia (33 million in total) in those figures.
&gt; 
&gt; Of course, the average skews upwards because of a few countries with very large populations. The median US state, Kentucky, has a population of 4.5 million (slightly less than Ireland), and have of them are smaller than that. The European median state is Denmark, with a population of 5.8 million (slightly more than Wisconsin). Although there are huge differences between US states (580,000 in Wyoming versus 39 million in California), Europe has 8 states that are larger and 7 that are smaller.
&gt; 
&gt; The main thing to take away from this is I had no idea some states were so big! Florida actually beats New York state at 20 million, though that's probably because the metropolis spills into New Jersey and beyond. Pennsylvania, of all states, is next. And then after Illinois (Chicago) come Ohio and Georgia, both of which I had down as pretty rural. On the other hand, New England states are among the smallest.

&gt;Due to repeated detections, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has assessed the health risks caused by chlorate in foods. The German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) has updated its opinion on chlorate on this basis.

&gt;**Chlorates are salts of chloric acid. Sodium and potassium chlorate used to be employed as herbicides but the use of plant protection and biocidal products containing chlorate is no longer permitted in the EU.** Chlorate can occur, however, as a by-product when using chlorinated substances for cleaning or disinfection. According to the latest available findings, the likely entry path is the contact of foods with water that was previously treated with chlorinated biocidal products for disinfection purposes.",North Rhine-Westphalia (Germany),/r/europe/comments/aia09n/john_bolton_brexiteer/eems7vk/,4-Vektor,1548094948

They show almost 17,000 Ukrainians lived in Lithuania early this year, up 42 percent from the same period last year.

The community of Russians who arrived in Lithuania had almost 12,500 members, which is down 3 percent year-on-year. Also fairly the same number of Belarusians lived in Lithuania and their number rose by a third over a year.

The citizens of the above-mentioned countries make 84 percent of the total number of foreigners residing in Lithuania, with Latvians, Germans and Polish making the largest group of foreigners from EU member states.

All in all, the number of foreigners residing in Lithuania rose 17.5 percent over a year, making slightly more than 2 percent of the total population in Lithuania.

2990,"I think that a number of people assume that the UK's true preference is for a backstopped deal over no-deal, and that they are bluffing and the EU and UK are playing chicken.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_(game)

&gt;The game of chicken, also known as the hawk–dove game or snowdrift game,[1] is a model of conflict for two players in game theory. The principle of the game is that while it is to both players’ benefit if one player yields, the other player's optimal choice depends on what their opponent is doing: if the player opponent yields, they should not, but if the opponent fails to yield, the player should. 

My *guess* is that that is not true, that the payoff matrix for the UK has a higher payoff for no-deal than backstopped deal.  For a game of chicken, both players must benefit from not yielding in the case and only in the case that the other player yields; if that's not true, you're not playing chicken.  If you're playing chicken, you're just trying to figure out who flinches first.

If you changed the structure of the game such that Northern Ireland explodes on March 30 if no-deal happens, *then* it would be a game of chicken.

This is part of the reason Russia sometimes isn't considered as European. They've historically been on the periphery and excluded from the definition, whereas the core of Europe, being the Carolingian Empire, is roughly the founding states of the EU, with the Latin-Germanic culture being most centrally European.

so romantic that it actually happend. and yes there were problems, revolutions tend to have problems. the american revolution also had its moments, it was still for the best.

&gt;&gt;the same people that do it now, but without shareholders.
&gt;
&gt;Shareholders don't run the court system. You've never served on a jury. 

most cases never reach an actual court but get a plea bargain, and from the cases that reach court only a few get an actual jury, those juries are selected trough such a system that it allows for manipulation.

&gt;&gt;you think capital builds anything? you think a society cannot save  surplus and expand? things will still exist, but they will not be owned  by private individuals. all that extra profit, right back to the  community, what to do with it? democratic system will decide that.
&gt;
&gt;&amp;#x200B;

&gt;&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Capital builds everything. You're talking about capital in the political sense as a group of people who have money. I'm talking about capital as in actual money and resources. Who would tax and save this surplus? Who would enforce and collect this taxation? Who would make any strategic decision to invest in new technology? Some hierarchical figure. 

you know this argument was used by royalists on how to elect a leader, ""but without a king how will you maintain order?"", well, imagine a president that, at the will of the people, can be deposed. no reason given, we just dont want you.

and there you have it, a president, with a system to hold him accountable to his electorate.

*Mieux répartir les revenus ou se libérer du marché ?*

**Déplorer les inégalités, ignorer leurs causes**

« Des riches plus riches et des pauvres plus pauvres. » De ce constat cent fois formulé on peut déduire des solutions politiquement opposées : adoucir le capitalisme, disent les uns ; socialiser la richesse, rétorquent les autres. Avant de resurgir dans les slogans d’Occupy Wall Street, ce débat a traversé le XXe siècle. La mise en avant des inégalités dans le discours public a elle aussi une histoire.

Paru en 2013, le livre de Thomas Piketty Le Capital au XXIe siècle s’est vendu à plus de deux millions et demi d’exemplaires à travers le monde. Depuis ce succès phénoménal, l’inégalité est largement perçue comme le grand problème moral de notre temps. Aux États-Unis, Karl Marx figure parmi les meilleures ventes de la catégorie « Free Enterprise » d’Amazon, et le jeune magazine américain de gauche Jacobin est à présent une publication grand public. On peut cependant se demander dans quelle mesure cette mode s’accorde avec les idées de Marx. En réalité, la notion d’inégalités de revenus était rarement utilisée au XIXe siècle, et sa centralité dans le débat public a considérablement appauvri notre façon de penser la justice sociale (1).

La meilleure façon de comprendre cette évolution est de parcourir l’un des classiques du socialisme, Le Capital. Aussi surprenant que cela puisse paraître, le terme « inégalité » n’apparaît pas plus de quatre fois (cela varie selon les traductions) dans le volumineux chef-d’œuvre du philosophe allemand. Jusqu’à la fin du XIXe siècle, aucun penseur ne s’était en effet préoccupé de placer chaque individu sur un axe et le revenu total sur un autre pour en mesurer la distribution. Comptaient les différences entre les classes et les facteurs de production, plutôt que celles existant entre les individus. Ce n’est qu’avec le travail du sociologue italien Vilfredo Pareto (1848-1923) qu’émergent des outils modernes de mesure de l’inégalité. Pour Marx, le problème n’était pas d’envisager comment répartir les revenus entre les individus, mais d’imaginer une société délivrée du marché.

Qu’il s’agisse de la production, du travail ou, plus généralement, des relations humaines, la « société de marché », comme l’appelait l’économiste et anthropologue Karl Polanyi, était considérée comme une menace pour la démocratie dans la mesure où elle laissait le marché façonner l’ordre social plutôt que l’inverse. Ce type de société avait non seulement éliminé du débat politique la question de l’allocation des ressources, mais également modifié la nature des transactions sociales en tant que telles. Une longue éclipse

C’est pourquoi le sociologue Richard Titmuss défendit l’idée selon laquelle l’objectif d’un État social était d’inculquer et de préserver l’« esprit de Dunkerque » — l’expression renvoyait au sauvetage de centaines de milliers de soldats alliés sur les côtes françaises en mai-juin 1940 grâce à une flottille de centaines de navires civils, un événement qui eut un impact très important au Royaume-Uni (2). Titmuss voyait là les germes de la « société généreuse » à venir. À l’été 1940, écrit-il, avec Dunkerque, « l’humeur du peuple changea et, avec elle, les valeurs. Puisque les dangers devaient être partagés, il devait en être de même pour les ressources ». Cependant, ce nouvel ordre, loin de se limiter à une simple redistribution des revenus, visait à créer les institutions démocratiques capables de vaincre ce que William Beveridge, économiste britannique et théoricien de l’État social, appellerait dans un rapport célèbre, en 1942, les cinq « géants » — pauvreté, insalubrité, maladie, ignorance et chômage —, afin de promouvoir la solidarité au-delà du seul contexte de la guerre.

Par conséquent, l’« esprit de Dunkerque » étendra notablement le rôle assigné à l’État, en particulier pour garantir à sa population des droits sociaux à visée universelle (à la santé, à l’éducation, au travail, au logement…). Cette révolte du corps social contre le « laisser-faire » empruntait une voie médiane entre les législations sociales mises en œuvre en Allemagne par le chancelier Otto von Bismarck dans les années 1880 et la socialisation à grande échelle conduite en Union soviétique depuis octobre 1917.

Une part croissante des salaires est alors socialisée pour financer d’imposants systèmes de sécurité sociale. Les taux d’imposition élevés appliqués aux plus aisés permettent la création de services publics, lesquels forment la base d’une nouvelle « propriété sociale ». Cette notion, utilisée en France à la fin du XIXe siècle, avait pour objet de conjurer le spectre d’une guerre civile déchirant une société où seuls les propriétaires disposaient de la pleine citoyenneté. Juxtaposée à la propriété privée existante, une propriété sociale mettrait « à la disposition des non-propriétaires un type de ressources qui n’est pas la possession directe d’un patrimoine privé, mais un droit d’accès à des biens et à des services collectifs qui ont une finalité sociale (3) ».

Yes, because some things are human rights. And some thing are needed to help people get to a point in life that they can use the same opportunities as others and are not held back due to circumstances they have no control over.

&gt;You imply that you can only be rich by being unethical but you sure enjoy their taxes. So you don't want to burden your conscience by being unethical but you do enjoy the benefits of it while bashing them.

I don't. Read again: **I don't care if people are rich, as long as they pay their share.**

I don't enjoy taxes, I know they are necessary. And by avoiding them on a large scale, that is hurting society. The same society the people and corporations who avoid taxes get their wealth from, since those people buy and use the things they are selling.

&gt;More than half of a European country's budget (which comes from taxes) goes to pensions and unemployment and other benefits like that.

Yes, most countries spent most of their budget on pensions, healthcare and unemployment. What is the argument here exactly?

&gt;If it was only about infrastructure then I'd agree but then taxes would be minuscule then.

Good thing I did not say just infrastructure then, but: infrastructure, the education, healthcare and other institutions. What happens when your employee gets sick? They need to be treated to get back to work, your company enjoys the benefit of that for example.

And like I said, the companies profit from the society as a whole. Which needs these things to run. And if they don't pay their fair share, society hurts because of that and in the long term that will impact growth and the money these corporations are making.

Of course discussions can be had about what a fair share is, but that is not the argument you are making. If you think certain taxes should be lower, fine.

If you plan on actually interfering with the market it's a bad idea though. If this limit is low enough as to make renting unprofitable, land owners just aren't gonna rent anymore, and then you'll have another problem, and an even bigger one at that.

Increase in apartment price is 99% of the times because of a lack of supply. You could have either extremely high base costs (cement, wood, etc), or you could have a monopoly in the housing market. But I don't think neither are true here.

Nearly every situation that has escalated out of control enjoyed a period before it was the notion was silly... Including Brexit, which hasn't finished escalating.

&gt; Thinking WW2 is something you can joke about but Brexit oh no that's too tragic, that's straight up thin-skinned hypocrisy imho.

One of the most famous jokes about WW2 and Germany, would be Faulty Towers and, ""don't mention the war"". It's a joke laughing at the British, and their awkwardness with the subject... You don't think that appropriate humour?

Brexit will be the greatest calamity to befall the UK since WW2, but you're going to minimise the tragedy as in impacts me?.. On that, sorry but fuck off, you're being a cunt.

Did Thatcher not have a democratic mandate to carry out her electoral programme for not having achieved more than 50% of the votes? Creating a parliament in Dublin was in Sinn Féin's electoral manifesto by the way.

Besides you are missing the point. The vote in 1918, like the decades beforehand, was overwhelmingly in favour of sovereignty for Ireland. People in favor of autonomy within the United Kingdom had won a democratic mandate and tried to achieve the same *for decades.* Every time Conservatives and Unionists (both in Westminster and Belfast) had managed to block the same, threatening to [use force against our democratic mandate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster_Covenant) to resist autonomy/Home Rule.

3200,"That’s what I’m asking you, what developments were added? The point here is the world took big stop or went backwards in technology and science when ancient empires withered. Next real advancements started to appear after ca 1000 years or more. You talking “agricultural revolution” but we know Babylonians and Egyptians has very advanced irrigation and agriculture millennia before Islam. Also 

&gt;The historian Eliyahu Ashtor wrote in 1976 that agricultural production declined in the period immediately after the Arab conquest in areas of Mesopotamia and Egypt, on the limited basis of records of taxes collected on cultivated areas.[34] In a 2012 paper focusing on the Sawād area of Iraq, Michele Campopiano concluded that Iraqi agricultural output declined in the 7th to 10th century; he attributed this decline to ""competition of the different ruling groups to gain access to land surplus"".[35]

&gt;In 2009, the historian Michael Decker[38][f] stated that widespread cultivation and consumption of four staples, namely durum wheat, Asiatic rice, sorghum and cotton were already commonplace under the Roman Empire and Sassanid Empire, centuries before the Islamic period.

&gt;Furthermore, there is clear evidence that agricultural devices such as watermills and waterwheels, shadufs, norias, sakias, water screws and water pumps were widely known and applied in Greco-Roman agriculture long before the Muslim conquests.

That's half of the truth. Foreign investors don't randomly chose where to invest, their election is based on the politics made by the state. For example, in Spain taxes are usually lower in Madrid than in other regions. All high-speed train lines go to or come from Madrid, while there are several areas which are not connected at all. Same for the airport: AENA considers the primarily airport to be Barajas-Madrid and don't allow any other airport in Spain to compete with it.

I'm not saying that the Madrid region didn't do many things well to be in the position they are now, but there are many examples of countries with many strong economic hubs like Germany, Italy or even the Netherlands.

3232,"Like I said:

&gt; I don't care if people are rich, as long as they pay their share.

And a lot of people make a lot of money in good ways, that is fine, I'm not against that. Just as many times, it is reached through unethical means, because you happen to know the right people, or because you inherit it.

And why should we want people to use ""tricks""? Those ""tricks"" shouldn't be there in the first place, since they are used to not pay a fair share of taxes, while enjoying the benefits of the society that does pay their share. You can't just use the infrastructure, the education, healthcare and other institutions and then go: well, fuck paying for that. That's is damaging in the long term, since when a country can't keep funding those things properly, you are undermining the middle class your wealth is based on, because they buy your stuff to keep your companies growing. That is what I mean with it not being smart, because you go for short term profit over long term sustainable business. A 1% wealth tax like the article talks about is just a way of trying to get money back that is leaked away by loopholes, it doesn't fix the issue itself.

I really don't get your point here - or your strange hostile tone - as if I am somehow wrong for being against tax loopholes and people not paying back to the society their wealth is based on.",,/r/europe/comments/ai8x2z/worlds_26_richest_people_own_as_much_as_poorest/eem1ojs/,cissoniuss,1548072785

3294,"I once drank a whole gallon of milk in a whole day and I could feel my bones expand. At first I thought I was just full from the milk, but my skin started to form stretch marks and I was visibly wider. I didn't know what was happening but I had an uncontrollable urge to drink more milk. I drove into the nearest gas station and literally ripped the door off the rifrigerated section containing the milk.

I started chugging gallon after gallon of milk standing right there in the store, my skin ripping at the seams. The cashier ran over to stop me but I swatted him aside and in one clean blow he landed across the room, shattering every bone in his pathetic meat suit. There was nothing left of him but a wet bloody puddle deprived of structure. I never thought I had it in me to kill but by now I had ascended beyond petty morality.

As I finished my eighth gallon it felt as though my stomach would rupture. My ribs broke out of my chest like a baby xxenomorph. My finger bones had grown through my hands a white nub could be seen protruding from my nose. My face was so stretched over my now massive skull I looked like Jenny McCarthy. My biceps and muscles were hard and calcified. My boner now had a bone.

I finished my twelfth gallon and began screaming and flexing, my skin tearing around my robust skeletal frame. With one final push I shed my meat chrysalis. I was free.

I didn't even use the door I simply walked out the wall of the gas station. Mortar and stone yielded to my mighty calcium. The cops were already there. In terror they began firing at me but even lead is no match for calcium. I walked straight toward one, reached down his throat and pulled his skeleton from his flesh sheath. With his bone I assembled a mighty claymore sword. With a single swing I cleaved the Earth in twain and descended into the inky black. Here I wait until the time I'm called into service for the great skellington war.

3457,"Everyone is legally under conscription and should SHTF, it would mobilize large force. The defense forces in Sweden has chosen to actively train only smaller number during peace time. Essentially what they think they need to blunt and counter a first attack. Plus what they can equip realistically and so on. Should conflict continue the *supposedly* ""non-conscripts"" will be conscripted and trained to reinforce the quickly mobilized active reserves.

&amp;#x200B;

So everyone is conscripted, but not everyone does active military service, since the state and defense forces chooses not to train everyone into active reserve.

&amp;#x200B;

How it individually works is matter of volunteering and need. If they find suitable volunteers they take them first (better morale among the service members) after that if no suitable volunteer is found the most suitable non-volunteer is ""volunteered"".

&amp;#x200B;

And no it is in no way ""fair"", but that isn't the point since all are under conscription. So they can just choose the most suitable among the volunteers and just say ""do your duty"". It isn't supposed to be fair individually on each decision. The ""fair"" part is that ultimately all are under conscription, whether that actively realizes and at what moment is more about national defense needs than personal preference or fairness.

&amp;#x200B;

Due to low numbers versus conscript pool, usually ones who don't really want to don't end up actively serving during peace time due to it not making sense to the service. Bad tempered, ill moraled people hamper training. Thus they take volunteers and even among not actively volunteering one can find an exceedingly suitable candidate for the spot who doesn't mind too much.

Many social institutions, like hospitals, kindergartens, retirement homes, communal services, etc. relied on this cheap workforce. 

When the military service was discontinued, this social or civil service also left because it was the substitute service for the military one.

2) Fyrom needs NATO and the EU more than we need fyrom.  So why create more tensions for an existing member of the Union?  

3) By giving them the name Macedonia will not solve the issue.  The tensions will always be there and will create more instability in the region.
  
So if Fyrom is so adamant about being Macedonian you shouldn't be speaking a Slavic language or consider Greece as a separate entity.

3724,"Another example of successful contact between Medieval Europe and Islam is Al-Andalus (the part of Spain controlled by the Cordoba Caliphate). The Caliphate was very tolerant to other faiths and culture flourished. However, whenever an outsider came in, such as when the Almoravids or the Almohads, two Berber dynasties, conquered it from Morocco, or after the Reconquista, it experienced massacres and intolerance. The outsider, not used to share with others, came in with its narrow-minded views and that was what caused the problems, not the cohabitation of cultures, but the will to exclude the others.

Other examples throughout the world exist, such as the cohabitation of many cultures and religions within the Persian Achaemenid Empire. Small aside, byt it's funny that the modern Western view on the conflict between the Greek city States and the Achaemenid Empire (largely propagated by Hollywood) is that Greeks stood as defenders of freedom against the brutal Persian invaders. However, the Greeks made extensive use of slavery, the Persians didn't. The Greeks were notoriously xenophobes and discriminated against other peoples, the Persians didn't, etc.

Microaggressions are the everyday verbal, nonverbal, and environmental slights, snubs, or insults, whether intentional or unintentional, that communicate hostile, derogatory, or negative messages to target persons based solely upon their marginalized group membership (from Diversity in the Classroom, UCLA Diversity &amp; Faculty Development, 2014). The first step in addressing microaggressions is to recognize when a microaggression has occurred and what message it may be sending. The context of the relationship and situation is critical. Below are common themes to which microaggressions attach.

Examples: ""There is only one race, the human race.""

""I believe the most qualified person should get the job.""

""America is the land of opportunity.""

""Affirmative action is racist.""

""I don't notice people's race."" 

**""America is a melting pot."" **

""Everyone can succeed in this society if they work hard enough.""

That is a well known concept called 'tyranny of the majority'. Democracy does not mean that the majority gets to decide what is best for all other groups that want something else. That is why most, if not all, developed democracies have all kinds of institutions and checks and balances to make sure that does not happen.

3912,"&gt;  Prices are not even comparable and rent in Italy is so much cheaper, even in richer cities with better wages. 

[According to wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_European_countries_by_average_wage), the average monthly wages in Italy are around €1700, while in Ireland they are €2525 and €2350 in the UK.   

Construction costs are heavily constrained by wages, and market price accompanies disposable income.  Thus it's more than expected that places where wages are high will end up with higher housing costs.

&gt; The real problem is rich people (especially foreign investors) buying multiple properties in big cities as a real estate investment and keeping them empty.

Your assertion is not only devoid of any rational basis, it also is flies in the face of reason.   In europe, the main economic player influencing real estate prices is the central and local governments, particularly their urban planning and urban renewal policies.  It makes absolutely no difference if ""rich people"" buy houses here or there, because central and local governments have very deep pockets and a mandate to spend absurd amounts of cash influencing the housing market to serve the public good in accordance to the government's vision.  It makes absolutely no difference in real estate prices if a deep-pocketed investor decides to dump cash in a real estate investment if a local government invests the tax payer's cash increasing the housing supply.

It's better then teaching people from scratch  as they already know the basics.  Creates some military pride in your country which I think is important to some degree.

Disadvantages are that if you are in a high paid job you have to leave for 6 months r longer so you get a decrease in pay.

Of these people, the military takes those who are fit for duty and who the military thinks would be most capable. However, since the military does not put everyone in basic training they choose the best. Swedish military does not have the funds to make everyone a soldier.

Another effect of this rally was to show his opponents the numbers of his supporters. Anti-Vucic protesters gather every Saturday in Belgrade, and there is usually between 10k and 50k of them, so it was important for Vucic to show that there is more of them.

They don't understand the way their orders are interpreted by people whose prejudices their policy helps feed. It's not, ever, just down to a government.

You seem to think that, like in the european society of the time, the islamic world was against co-existing religions (or you would not point out how ""chirstian"" everything is), which is not the case. Thanks to the collaboration of greek scholars and arabs Aristotles (among many others) were saved. 
 
They weren't lost in europe, there were copies translated directly from greek to latin. Thomas Aquinas, for example, read Aristotle translated directly from the Greek texts into Latin by William of Moerbeke.

That was precisely the point of my comment, you can't complain about immigrants only when they come to you but not when you're the immigrant yourself. The borders seem inconvenient only when they pose a limitation to you but when it's to keep others out suddenly they're a godsend and are only about law and order.

Right, europeans weren't giving enough attention to a famous greek philosopher because they spent more time studying an arguably even more famous greek philosopher. 

&gt;and it only was thanks to the fervent Aristotelism of the islamic world that most of his body of work was saved. This is a well established historical consensus by the way.

Right, if it was only thanks to the arabs then i don't see how a guy like William of Moerbeke could translate aristoteles directly from greek.

Their independence model relied on the rest of Spain playing along and letting them keep all the nice parts of being in Spain, ignoring any border effects, assuming that everyone in Spain would still buy their products, hire their services, banking included, keep the logistics of the Iberian retail there, the seats of multinational companies for the peninsula, full control of the best pass through the Pyrenees... Spain would still pay their pensioners, provide double nationality, and of course also the fast lane into the EU. It's like a deranged version of Brexit.

Obviously they lost investments and found out that companies would simply relocate. You can't be a hub of Spain being out of Spain, it doesn't matter that 48% of your voters sold on this *milkmaid and her pail* tale think so.

 The EU at this moment is not about the elimination of national sovereignity but a compromise between state and the community as to maintain a free and equitable market. You need some form of interventionism on some sectors of the market and the economy as a whole(Agriculture, regional development, comercial policy comes to mind) and that needs to be harmonized by all the countries within the union, otherwise it will be a fantastic failure.

&gt;There’s a reason Estonian, German and Finnish people wanted independence from the Swedish empire. The Swedish elite didn’t always have their best interests in mind.

Horrible analogy. The swedish elite did not have the best interests of swedish citizens in their mind either. All they wanted was for the aristocracy and its offsprings to prosper, together with the Clergy so nobody gets in their way. And people did not rebel against ""swedish rule"". In that period nobody cared who rules you as long as they offer a good living standard. Nobody rebelled within the Ottoman Empire(Even though they were pagans!) as long as it was prosperous and wealthy, but actually cooperated with it.

While I have my reservations about Juncker, he said we needed to work harder (on finding a solution to southern Italy's chronic underdevelopment) rather than looking to the commission for prepackaged solutions and to pin the blame on it if they fail. Which is a reasonable position, given how the recipe for the South has been ""Huh...more money, somehow"" for the last seven flippin' decades. Of course, those wanting to shit on the EU rephrased it as ""Italians are lazy"", which is dishonest at the very least (another stereotype fulfilled, woooo)

&gt;how shitty and slow its bureocracy is 
Of course it is - it's been designed that way by national governments to not bother national governments too much.

4482,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bearskin

&gt;A bearskin is a tall fur cap, usually worn as part of a ceremonial military uniform.

-

&gt; Following the Battle of Waterloo and the action in which they gained their name, the Grenadier Guards were permitted to wear the bearskin. In 1831, this practice was extended to the other two regiments of Foot Guards then in existence. The Royal Scots Dragoon Guards, Honourable Artillery Company and officers of Fusilier regiments also wear the bearskin as part of their ceremonial uniform.

-

&gt; The standard bearskin of the British Foot Guards is 18 inches tall, weighs 1.5 pounds and is made from the fur of the Canadian black bear.

-

&gt; In 2005, the Ministry of Defence began a two-year test of artificial fur for the hats. The army has already replaced beaver hats and leopard skins, worn by some of its soldiers, with artificial materials.[14] In March 2005, Labour MP Chris Mullin called for an immediate ban on bearskin hats stating that they ""have no military significance and involve unnecessary cruelty.""[15]

AFAIK the science and biology curriculum currently doesn't include anything religious because of the Separation of Church and State. So this means that kids are being taught stuff like the theory of Evolution, etc, etc, which means that it's much harder for the Christian groups to indoctrinate their kids. This is pissing them off, so they are trying to manufacture controversy so they can insert their bullshit under the guise of 'teaching the controversy' and 'giving both sides of the story'. Things like History are also under attack, where they're trying to warp and downplay things like the reasons for the Civil War (eg, it was about 'state rights', but ommitting the part about the state rights in question was slavery), how fucked up the KKK and racism in general was in the 50s and 60s, stuff like that.

If you count just Jasenovac concentration camp with the lowest estimate you get more. It was a bloody multisided civil war in Yugoslavia with way more deaths than anything in 1990s.

Same goes for Bosnia where some of the bloodiest battles took place.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_White

&gt;Case White (German: Fall Weiss), also known as the Fourth Enemy Offensive (Serbo-Croatian: Četvrta neprijateljska ofenziva/ofanziva) was a combined Axis strategic offensive launched against the Yugoslav Partisans throughout occupied Yugoslavia during World War II. It was one of the most significant confrontations of World War II in Yugoslavia. 

Over 10 000 partizan dead.

&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_Black

&gt;Case Black (German: Fall Schwarz), also known as the Fifth Enemy Offensive (Serbo-Croatian: Peta neprijateljska ofanziva) in Yugoslav historiography and often identified with its final phase, the Battle of the Sutjeska (Serbo-Croatian: Bitka na Sutjesci pronounced [bîtka na sûtjɛst͡si]) was a joint attack by the Axis taking place from 15 May to 16 June 1943, which aimed to destroy the main Yugoslav Partisan force, near the Sutjeska river in south-eastern Bosnia. The failure of the offensive marked a turning point for Yugoslavia during World War II. 

Again, around 10 000 dead partizans

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kozara_Offensive

&gt;The Kozara Offensive, also known as Operation West-Bosnien by the Axis, was fought in 1942 on and around the mountain of Kozara in northwestern Bosnia. It was an important battle of the Yugoslav Partisan resistance movement in World War II. It later became an integral part of Yugoslav post-war mythology, which celebrated the courage and martyrdom of outnumbered and outgunned Partisans and civilians.[4] Certain sources mistakenly identify the Kozara Offensive as part of Operation Trio.

**Auto Summary** (TL,DR):

&gt; Keizer is one of around 60 physicians on the books of the Levenseindekliniek, or End of Life Clinic, which matches doctors willing to perform euthanasia with patients seeking an end to their lives, and which was responsible for the euthanasia of some 750 people in 2017.
&gt; 
&gt; It is too early to say if euthanasia in the Netherlands has reached a high-water mark - and too early to say if the other countries that are currently making it easier to have an assisted death will also hesitate if the practice comes to be seen as too widespread. But it is significant that in addition to the passionate advocacy of Bert Keizer - who positively welcomes the ""Slippery slope"" - Boer's more critical views are being solicited by foreign parliamentarians and ethicists who are considering legal changes in their own countries.
&gt; 
&gt; ""In the coldest weeks of last winter,"" Theo Boer told me, ""a doctor friend of mine was told by an elderly patient: 'I demand to have euthanasia this week - you promised.' The doctor replied: 'It's -15C outside. Take a bottle of whisky and sit in your garden and we will find you tomorrow, because I cannot accept that you make me responsible for your own suicide.' The doctor in question, Boer said, used to perform euthanasia on around three people a year. He has now stopped altogether.""
&gt; 
&gt; ""You try to make your child happy,"" Monique said in her matter-of-fact way, ""But Eelco wasn't happy in life. He wanted to stop suffering, and death was the only way."" Eelco came of age just as euthanasia was being legalised.
&gt; 
&gt; It's little wonder that the Dutch Voluntary Euthanasia Society, or NVVE, vaunts it as an example of euthanasia at its best.
&gt; 
&gt; The question for any country contemplating euthanasia legislation is whether the practice must inevitably expand - in which case, as Agnes van der Heide recognises, death will eventually ""Get a different meaning, be appreciated differently"".","Born in Europe(U.K.), Native of EU, in the Madness of Dis-U.K.",/r/europe/comments/ahvmns/death_on_demand_has_euthanasia_gone_too_far/eeihur3/,Cheapo-Git,1547972043

4665,"That is sort of what happens every time you upload something on youtube and it is already biased against the uploader. If any copyrighted content is detected, by default your content will be flagged and you'll have to appeal to get it published. That appeal doesn't have to be approved even though your content is according to fair use laws. You could sue, but practically you can't afford to, so the copyright claimer can abuse their advantage. 

Keep in mind the above is the system in a situation where legal risks to Youtube are low compared to what is proposed. The more risk and cost you add for youtube, the harsher the detection system will get. So even if you take the hyper optimistic view of no intentional abuse of the new system, it will still be worse for the regular users. Add intentional abuse of the copyright claim makers and youtube has two choices, either crack down harder on the users (likely option) or allow people to get easy money out of youtube for failing to protect their copyright claims (very unlikely). The abuse is also not limited to the copyright claimers. The platform themselves can selectively use this as an excuse to censor content. They do this already to some extent, but increasing legal risks of inaction would without a doubt make things even worse.

I just don't see in general how this proposal is in any way good for us, so I don't see why we should side against companies like Google on this.

4843,"Ye don't listen to this bloke. Funnily enough a username like royalsocialist and EU emblem going against the history of Croats, typical what else is new....
The west tends to skew history in the favour of the bosnians because everyone loves an underdog, and during the time of 1991-99 it was impossible for any muslim group in the balkans too look bad in the public eye because they were the established under dog. 
After the early stages of the bosnian war in which the Serb-Yugo army was attacking Bosnian and Croat positions, things slowed down in the winter. During this time the HVO complained that the Bosnian army was not participating fairly in the fight against the Serbs, rather gather man power and resources and leaving the Croat forces to man the front lines. In 1993, the greater portion of the ABiH forces in central Bosnia deployed against the BSA were stationed on the Visoko-Sarajevo front, while the HVO forces deployed against the BSA were stationed primarily on the Turbe-Travnik front.14 However, a substantial portion of the ABiH III Corps was deployed in positions surrounding the Croat enclaves in the Travnik–Novi Travnik–Vitez-Busovaca-Kiseljak area, far from the BSA’s front lines.As for Muslim charges that the Croats abandoned the line against the Serbs at Jajce and elsewhere, it is true that HVO forces in Jajce in October, 1992, recognized that the town was on the verge of falling to the BSA and withdrew first. However, HVO forces on the Turbe-Travnik line did not abandon their positions to the BSA in June, 1993, as the Muslims have charged. In fact, they were attacked from the rear by the ABiH and forced to abandon their positions and flee across the front lines into the hands of the BSADuring this time both Bosnian and Croat forces started purifying their own forces respectively, besides a very very small minority of a couple of Muslim soldiers who stayed loyal to the Croat forces. Also during the same winter it was discovered that Bosnian army had started creating secret back roads through the dense hills and forrests around the territory controlled by the HVO around central bosnia and southern bosnia near mostar preparing for an obvious summer offensive. A rarely mentioned fact because it goes against the under dog mentality. 
The reason for such betrayal lies in the fact that in 1992, the Croats in central bosnia controlled the important military factories that were created during the Yugoslavia times. With the serbs on all sides getting in supplies was extremely hard for the BiH (Bosnian) army thus they needed these factories and the HVO rightfully refused to pass the factories over. 
The most important of the military production facilities in central
Bosnia was the Slobodan Princip Seljo (SPS) factory in Vitez. The SPS factory manufactured military explosives essential for the production of mortar and artillery shells. It was the only such manufacturing facility in the Balkans, and it was the only important military production facility controlled by the HVO forces.
The importance of the SPS explosives factory to the ABiH was signaled during talks in Bonn, Germany, between Pres. Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Pres. Franjo Tudjman of Croatia in January, 1993. In a message to the UN secretary general, negotiator Thorvald Stoltenberg noted: “In the talks he had with Tudjman in our presence, Izetbegovic insisted the Croats must leave Vitez because it had an ammunition plant that the Muslims must have. Tudjman replied that the Muslims will never have the plant and will never be able to take Vitez militarily. However, if they did, the plant would be blown up.”

The Croats never had a dream of greater croatia, how would we when the Serbs already controlled more than a quarter of Croatian land in 1992. The Croats in central Bosnia were out numbered 3:1 for the whole war.",,/r/europe/comments/ahk3o1/serbian_policeman_offers_water_to_an_elderly/eei5awy/,Syria_War,1547959885

&gt;**Almost one million people** are now queuing for a home in Stockholm, Gothenburg or Malmö. The longest is queue in Stockholm and it is growing fast. This year alone, queue has grown by 40,000 people.  
&gt;  
&gt;So even though the number of mediated apartments is also expected to be record high this year - around 13,500, they are not enough. Currently, Bostadsförmedlingen has, for example, only 85 vacant apartments to convey among the total 636,000 people who queue for a first-hand contract

4994,"&gt;Ok, let's go over this again, granny, but for the last time because I am tired of the saying the same things 10 times. I might have ADHD, but you are already diving into Alzheimer's it seems. 
&gt;
&gt;&amp;#x200B;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;There are also other factors it doesn't have that other places don't. The most noticeable being high population density. There is also the fact that it is anomaly compared to other cities since they went down in reported rapes. You should take heed of your ow comment about logic.
&gt;
&gt;So national rates are going up, Stockholm's rates (which is not the majority of the cases, as you tried to imply already several times) go up, yet Stockholm is the anomaly. I would say the other 2 cities are the anomaly. In any case, Sweden is not just about those 3 cities, as you might know already. There are people living in other places too. 

Again, you fail to understand statistics. You should have paid more attention in high school. I can't help you if you are simply uneducated in this mstter

&gt;&gt; Except you didn't. See you were arguing that things are actually getting worse not better. When you actually analyse the results, you see they are actually getting better. Violent crimes are actually decreasing or stagnating. The increase is largely due to internet fraud. 
&gt;
&gt;In case you missed it, I'm pointing specifically to some crimes that are bound to be committed by some specific groups to show how Sweden has already changed in the recent years because of it. In any case, you missed to address the graph I provided you with, showing how most crimes were going up suddenly starting with 2014. You prefer to put your horse glasses on and see the fact that Malmo's rapes are decreasing, not that Sweden's in general are increasing year by year. I am not going to respond to the personal opinion you gave on my age and myself, since they are not true and just reek of some fake wise attitude you think you have, but you don't. I am not getting radicalized, stay chill lady, I'm just giving you some statistics that you can't read. 

Why did the data go up on 2013 then? As for radicalisation, look at your past comments. If you also go back to your original comment, you will see that you are lying for you never made the claims you say you are. Your claim was that Sweden is a bad situation. My claim is that is not since the arguments you are using are flawed. 

&gt;&gt; No one is stopping, I just don't want to discuss something that initial conversation was not about. Do you also want to discuss how to stop from? The various sociological and criminological views on crime? The new left's view of crime? The strain theory on crime? Prison reforms? History of policing? The benefits and cons of a more stringent police force? Foucault views on power and discipline? 
&gt;
&gt; We can if you want, I have no problem.

Go on then.

&gt;&gt; So you think that before the refugee crisis there were no rapes? You think that no Swedish people have ever raped? I would advise you to consider your own arguments before calling someone ignorant and stupid. 
&gt;
&gt;I can tell you didn't want to open the graph I gave you. It shows there exactly what I said, the sudden (quite big too I'd say) increase. Sure rapes happened before too, but the numbers were going up and down every a couple of years. Since 2014 however, they just keep going up and up. I'm pretty sure uneducated Muslim immigrants are more prone to rape women than uneducated Swedish people. 

I can tell that you didn't read you comment. You said that Swedes don't rape. Can you not lie or is this some psychological issue you have?

&gt;&gt; You are showing a bias by selecting specific pieces of data and ignoring the wider context. You focus on reported rapes yet ignore that sexual and violent assault has only gone up by 1%, a negligible increase. Then you ignore that violent crime is decreasing or stagnating. It is not violent offences like fraud that are increasing. Then there is the video. What does that have to do with anything? That was not relevant, it was just you pushing your narrative. 
&gt;
&gt;1% from year to another, compared to the constant increase that started in 2014. For one of the most developed countries in the world, that's not quite good I'd say. How is the video related? Instigation to violence and hate speech are not crimes too? I just want to know if such a thing happened ever before in Sweden. That gives me WW2 flashbacks in terms of anti-semitism tbh. 

Actually, if began in 2013 but went down in 2014. But crimes in Malmo are going down ad you yourself have acknowledged. So using this video ad evidence that Malmo is getting worse makes no sense, since the stats show it isn't. 

&gt;Just to be clear, I don't want to say Sweden is a hell hole. However, it is slowly turning into one thanks to some recent ""events"" and I will not abstain from showing it. Also, I am not the one who cannot read an article or open a link to see some statistics, I called you ignorant and stupid because you came up with fake numbers to get your point across. A lame point that is, but it was still dishonest. On top of it, you call me a kid and whatnot just to try to diminish my opinion on this, but age is not relevant, the truth is still the truth. 

Except it isn't turning into a hell hole. A 1% increase is not turning into a hell hole. And again you are lying. Read your comments again

When the cavalry routed the infantry would be flanked and routed. The weakness of Rome's cavalry is how Hannibal won several battles.

Romes army throughout all centuries was mostly infantry, horses were most of the time used for transport, scouting and light skirmishes. Hannibals **cavalery** won against romes meager 2500 soldier big **cavalery** and attacked the now open army from the back. Thats exactly like I said bevor how cavalery was used back than.

You cant charge into infantry formations with horses, long spears, hellebards and polearms in general make this a suicide attempt.

5193,"I'm not sure where you're disagreeing here. 

&gt; I don't think so, Egypt has seen an increase in fertility recently, and so has most of north africa despite improving economic and educational conditions.

Well there's religious factors as well here, but even with that they're not developed nations. The majority of people are still not educated and work menial jobs, in such an environment child labor is still fairly common. 

&gt; Low fertility is a result of western culture, it isn't a result of things getting better. In the 60s, which were, in some ways, a high of american prosperity, fertility rose from 3 to 4 until the sexual revolution. The move to individualism, sexual revolution, etc -- and away from traditional 'group' values is what has led to a drop in fertility, not simply an increase in GDP per capita. You can pretty much pinpoint the massive drop in fertility to the sexual revolution in the western world.

Many countries have had individualism like America and had a high birth rate. But otherwise, yeah this is what I said. Bear in mind, that the fertility rate had already been declining by 1968, in fact by the Sexual Revolution it had already gone through a steep decline.

https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=sp_dyn_tfrt_in&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=sp_dyn_tfrt_in&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=country&amp;idim=country:USA&amp;ifdim=country&amp;hl=en_US&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false

The rate declines gradually, as society begins to change (unless they undergo a devastating war, famine or disease). In India for instance, the most developed regions have fertility rates comparable with most European nations rather than other Indian states. And I didn't say it was just due to an increase in GDP, but that it had more of a cascading effect. Like I said, it is increasingly acceptable to not have kids ,but in an environment like the 50's and 60's, it really wasn't and as a result was far more uncommon. Couples who grew old without kids would be ostracized or rumors would be spread about them. There was far more cultural push back then. 

&gt; You can be both economically successful as a nation and have a high fertility, it's just that the values we spread do not encourage this. 

Or we encourage values like freedom, choice, equality, individualism etc. basically all the values we cherish in the West. This doesn't seem to be the case because it's consistent everywhere, not just in the West. Japan for instance has been hit the worst, as has Korea. Many wealthy areas of developing nations likewise undergo the same thing, while the poor areas have high fertility. It is consistent and is not just with some ""sexual revolution"". 

&gt; We encourage values now such as 'only care for yourself',

Um what

&gt; 'think of your career',

Well then, maybe we should encourage maternal leave? Or are you saying we should discourage women from working? This is exactly the kind of thing the West was built on. Do you think we should emulate KSA and relegate women to a subjugated position of mothers and child bearers? I think there are better alternatives, like encourage men to be stay at home dads, provide more financial incentives to have kids like tax credits or subsidized childcare. 

&gt; 'it's too expensive to have kids'.

Well this literally true. Pre school is starting to cost as much as a college tuition in some cases, at least in America. Nevermind all the costs associated.  This is why I said one of the solutions is to subsidize childcare, as they are trying to do in Japan.

&gt; It's our culture that's the issue -- and I believe it is unsustainable.

Yes, our culture which values choice and freedom. Alot of people don't want kids anymore, and it's increasingly acceptable to be of this mindset. We could easily do somethings to raise the fertility rate, like ban contraception, force more children to be born out of wedlock. Romania did this in an attempt to replenish its war torn population.

Educated people might care, but if you are running a totalitarian government, everybody in your country probably already thinks educated people are elitist evil Zionists.

I'm not saying totalitarian leaders completely fabricated evidence. But, let's say there are some journalists you want to imprison, you just need to twist their words to make it seem like they support terrorists.

5221,"Re-exports shouldn’t count but they do sometimes get counted. There’s lots of other explanations though! Trade, especially in agricultural products (actually I only know really about ag products), is really hard to calculate so stuff like this happens a lot. Main causes of variation:

-	Differences in underlying records: is trade measured from National Accounts data rather than directly from custom or tax records?
-	Differences in import and export valuations: are transactions valued at FOB or CIF prices?
-	Inconsistent attribution of trade partners: how is the origin and final destination of merchandise established?
-	Difference between 'goods' and 'merchandise': how are re-importing, re-exporting, and intermediary merchanting transactions recorded?
-	Exchange rates: how are values converted from local currency units to the currency that allows international comparisons (most often the US-$)?
-	Differences between 'general' and 'special' trade system: how is trade recorded for custom-free zones?
-	Other issues: Time of recording, confidentiality policies, product classification, deliberate misinvoicing for illicit purposes.

5292,"&gt;So while Romania is perhaps 10 years away from reaching Poland, Poland is probably closer to 20-30 years from reaching Germany

While you’re right about Poland reaching Germany (and by that I mean Germany’s development level IN those 20-30 years, not just their current one), you’re wrong about Romania reaching Poland. Poland is developing extremely fast, at around Romania’s pace or faster (4-5%). Romania has started slowing down last year, and one can’t forget that much of their growth has been attributed to their government going on a big deficit and indebting themselves a lot to harness public investments, which makes Romania’s GDP growth further inflated, and Poland’s GDP growth truer than Romania’s. This means that I don’t see Romania getting to Poland’s level anytime soon (unless you mean Poland’s 2019 level, not Poland’s 2029 level).

&gt;Romania’s MENI doesn’t seem a great measure of development for them because of a large rural population pushing the figures down

Which is precisely why MENI is the best for Romania, as it accounts for the big rural populations living often without toilets at home, which renders a more accurate image of Romania than raw average nominal data",Poland,/r/europe/comments/ahlhx1/human_development_index_changes_in_european/eegtp5s/,LordParsifal,1547929433

5299,"Vlachs lived in the Balkans. We have written evidence about this frm the 8th century onwards. There's no written evidence about Romanians in Transylvania before the 16th century.

Vlachs lived all over the Balkans. When the Turks arrived, all sorts of Christians fled to Hungary. For example, Serbs fled to southern Hungary. The Hungarians gave them refuge and in return asked that they defend the borderland and convert to Catholicism. The conversion didn't really work out.

Similarly, Vlachs fled from the Balkans and the first record of them appearing in Transylvania was when they came through the Fogaras pass. Hungarians gave the refugees a place to live and in return asked them to defend the land and convert.

The migration from the Balkans into Hungary continued during the entire duration of the wars with the Turks, until 1700.

The reason why today there are many Romanians in Transylvania, a few Romanians in the Balkans, is because Vlachs were persecuted by everyone so of course their numbers were low. They were only given freedom in Hungary.

As a thanks, Romanians stabbed Hungary in the back and stole the ancient territory of Transylvania. They did this to the only people that ever treated them with kindness.

Similarly, they stabbed the Hungarians in the back again during WW2.

They again stabbed the Hungarians in the back during the FIFA qualification match in 2013. So you see, Romanians are genetic backstabbers :)",Vojvodina,/r/europe/comments/agj1no/albanian_becomes_the_second_official_language_in/eeggbzs/,flyingorange,1547921300

Which, btw, is incomparable to what the Swiss call Tilsiter: They just don't have the right environment to do it. Back in the days some cheesemakers moved from Emmental to Tilsit, made cheese there, it turned out differently so they changed the recipe to make the best of the circumstances. Swiss Tilsiter is that recipe, but not the sea climate, imported back to Switzerland. Holsteiner Tilsiter is that recipe, further refined, and with even more suitable climate between two seas.

In the end Swiss Tilsiter is much closer to the original Emmentaler than anything that's coming out of Holstein. If you want the real deal make sure to get properly aged Tilsiter, much of what's sold pre-cut etc. is quite young and mild, you don't even have to isolate it in the fridge.

New Zealand apparently also does Tilsiter, or at least they commented on the AOP application (and retracted all objections once they noticed that the application was for ""Holsteiner Tilsiter"", not ""Tilsiter"").

&gt;A Serb policeman offers water to an elderly ethnic Albanian villager in Kosovo. The old man is the only resident who remained in Glodjane after Serb police retook the village from members of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA). Clashes between ethnic Albanians, seeking independence for the Serbian province of Kosovo, and the Serbian security forces, determined to suppress the movement, took place on a civilian as well as a military level. The protests were against increasing ethnic violence. At least 20 people - 16 Albanians and four Serbs - had been killed the previous weekend. Srdjan Ilic: 'As an Associated Press photographer in Belgrade, I covered the conflicts in the former Yugoslav republics right from the beginning: in Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia, Kosovo and Macedonia, as well as the 1999 NATO-led air campaign and the fall of Milosevic. I was wounded three times in the course of my work, once in Slovenia and twice during the conflict in Kosovo, where this picture was taken. Binak Rama, the ethnic Albanian on the left, was taken to a Serbian police station in nearby Djakovica. He was released after questioning.'

This photo might be staged but the famous photo of a Kosovo Albanian giving his child to someone over a fense was staged as hell and nobody ever disputed that so loudly as people dispute this. Also people need to know that NATO used cluster bombs on civilian targets in Niš, depleted uranium bombs, bombed several hospitals, Chinese embassy and many more facts like Hashim Thaci the former prime Minister of Kosovo was head of human organ trafficking. This one sided media coverage is what creates animosity. Bad things happened to everyone in every war ever.

The game itself isn't really the problem - there are usually hitsounds (like extra drum sounds to tell you when you clicked so you can follow the rhythm more easily) and you can apply filters like double time (more like 1.5 time but it changes the song sufficiently) to it. The problem is the website to which the beatmaps get uploaded because they come with a file of the song which cannot be played by anything but osu in which it becomes transformative due to there being gameplay involved, thus it's a grey area that an upload filter would probably just ignore, so beatmaps would have to be uploaded to other more obscure websites.",,/r/europe/comments/ahdyyk/article_11_and_13_rejected_by_member_states/eeghtmv/,Kharaaz,1547922089

As I said, Izetbegovich was the one who pulled his signature from the deal made in March, 1992. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_plans_proposed_before_and_during_the_Bosnian_War#Carrington%E2%80%93Cutileiro_plan

That agreement was signed by all three sides, and then your side pulled the signature. The war started in the following week. Why would the Serbian leadership sign it if they planned, encouraged, and instructed the war? Do you remember that day? I do. 

And his famous speech? Have you considered the context? I also remember watching it live. He urged Izetbegovich to negotiate peace, and this was half a year before the agreement I mentioned above. He implored him to only consider peace and not war. War is destruction. Very bad choice of words for a politician, no doubt, but the context needs to be considered. Why the fuck would Izetbegovich be pushing for the war is the problem here. There was no army that he could fall back on (at that time, Karadzich still believed YNA would hold his back so he thought he had a lot more leverage than he did), he could already see that war is not pretty (Croatia), and there were no guarantees from anywhere outside the borders that he could get any kind of help.

5377,"&gt; This is blatant lie. 

Eh, no it isn't. Mladic and Karadzic *were* tried and convicted, and after his untimely death Milosevic *was* found to be in breach of the Genocide Convention. You seem to have a bigger problem with me saying that Milosevic was directly guiding Serbian troops or not. *I'm perfectly willing to concede that the ICTY did not find direct evidence for his direct involvement in the Srebrenica massacre during the case proceedings*, but the fact remains that Milosevic [directly supported and funded](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/milosevic-goes-on-trial-for-war-crimes) the Serbian troops in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina during the wars and gave direct orders for war; espoused xenophobic and hateful propaganda directed against non-Serbs before and during the wars via [the state media](https://www.pbs.org/wnet/wideangle/video/watch-full-episodes/media-by-milosevic-video-full-episode/852/); subsequentley continued to protect and defend the perpetrators of the genocide (also part of why he was found to be in breach of the Genocide Convention); [failed](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-13559597) to arrest and/or extradite them; and headed troops who *did* commit war crimes in the former Yugoslavia. With the extent of his involvement in the wars and the fact that he was the Serbian state leader, I am not going absolve him of any responsibility here.

And of course, Milosevic was the one who appointed Mladic as general of the Republika Sprska in the first place, even after Mladic was already accused of committing atrocities. Moreover, according to negotiator Wesley Clark, Milosevic [admitted](https://www.icj-cij.org/files/case-related/91/091-20070226-JUD-01-00-EN.pdf) (p. 225) that he knew of the plans to commit the atrocities in Srebrenica but that Mladic simply 'didn't listen'. 

&gt; After fall of Srebrenica in july of 1995, Serbia saved more than 800 Bosniaks from Srebrenica/Zepa, that run across border to Serbia : 

Why is this relevant as to whether or not Serbian troops (or Bosnian-Serbian troops, however you'd like to call them, point being is that they were Serbian) committed a genocide in Srebrenica? It's great that some Bosniaks were saved but that doesn't negate at all the fact that the Srebrenica genocide occurred, which was my point from the beginning onwards. The denial or downplaying of the Srebrenica genocide by Serbian troops is what's troubling many people, and not some sort of 'Western European teen liberal' conspiracy like the other guy was insinuating.",,/r/europe/comments/ahk3o1/serbian_policeman_offers_water_to_an_elderly/eeghxoj/,TheDustOfMen,1547922148

5436,"Doing so would have compromised the impartiality of the UN mission though, and then all the peacekeepers in Bosnia would have become targets. That's the argument from the standpoint of the officer on the ground anyway. Ultimately it's politics; the ""phone home syndrome"" that plagues all peacekeeping operations, regardless of the orders of the force commander, the Dutch government would not have tolerated its troops becoming more deeply involved. They would've just pulled them out instead, leaving the UNPROFOR mission even more hamstrung then it already was.

I ultimately sympathize with you; there ought to have been more troops and they ought to have taken a more aggressive posture. Today I think, things would be different, when you look at the UN missions in the DRC, South Sudan, Cote d'Ivoire, etc. you see a much more assertive stance regarding use of force and protection of civilians. In the '90s this sort of doctrinal understanding did not exist, which allowed for these sort of tragedies.

It's frustrating; the West screwed over Bosnia on so many levels, starting with the arms embargo and then culminating in the enforced partition.

&gt;I'm American, I've seen plenty of photos of American troops giving candy or water to Iraqi children, which provides cover for, you know, the illegal war rife with war crimes and sectarian violence.

So, what you're saying is, every single image of a US soldier giving sweets or water to an Iraqi kid is fiction, propaganda, and that prior to or after those photos, they were off butchering kids and burning mosques?

No, there were plenty of US troops, the majority in fact, that, despite knowing that Iraq was a pointless and illegal war showed some human compassion to some kids and gave what they could to locals.

As I said, it's a *seemingly* a nice gesture in the photo, you have no idea where it was taken, when it was taken, and what the context of the background is.

And to say that the Serb government commited crimes against humanity using their Army, and Serb militias and the likes of the Scorpions in BiH, that makes every Serb soldier a war criminal, is plain ignorant.

Now, as I said in my first post *it seemingly* shows an act of compassion, but I can't prove that to be fact, so I used a nondifinitive word, and until such time that you can prove to me that that Serb soldier is responsible for crimes against humanity, I'll stick to that point.

Fornthe avoidance of doubt, I'm very pro-Kosovan, I'm not in any way biased toward the Serbs, the exact opposite in fact, but to jump in, as you've done, acting as if none of the could have had any good in them, is mildly fuckinh annoying.

I'm glad you linked the document that you obviously didn't finished reading, because it CLEARLY STATES: 

""*Conclusion as to Responsibility for Events at Srebrenica under
Article III, Paragraph (a), of the Genocide Convention*

413.  In the light of the information available to it, the Court finds, as
indicated  above,  that ** it  has  not  been  established  that  the  massacres  at
Srebrenica  were  committed  by  persons  or  entities  ranking  as  organs  of
the Respondent (see paragraph 395 above). It finds also that it has not
been established that those massacres were committed on the instructions
or  under  the  direction  of  organs  of  the  respondent  State**

and now the part I was referring to:

**nor  that  the Respondent exercised effective control over the operations in the course
of  which  those  massacres,  which,  as  indicated  in  paragraph  297  above,
constituted the crime of genocide, were perpetrated**

and now the proof the UN (USA AND UK) let the massacre happen, just like the Serbian government have been found guilty of.

[*How Britain and the US decided to abandon Srebrenica to its fate - New research reveals that Britain and the US knew six weeks before massacre that enclave would fall – but they decided to sacrifice it in their efforts for peace*](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/04/how-britain-and-us-abandoned-srebrenica-massacre-1995)

&gt; “The intelligence services of at least two of the five permanent members of the UN security council knew already at the beginning of June 1995 – a month and a half before the attack – that the Serbs intended to capture, in the coming weeks, the three Eastern enclaves – meaning Srebrenica, Žepa and Goražde,” (...) UN military observer reported: “The Bosnian Serb army is now in a position to overrun the enclave. Since the UN response has been almost nonexistent, they will continue until they achieve their aims.”

The story of the nameless little migrant drowned with a school report sheet sewn on him

Draw by: Makkox 

She is one of the many unknown victims of the shipwreck of April 18, 2015, we are back to talk about it for a cartoon published by Makkox

We don't know his face, we don't know his name. But that's not why what we know about him hurts less: he came from Mali, he was 14 years old and had the hope of a new life sewn on him, in the form of a school reportbook that he could not attend anymore at home.

The story dates back to April 18, 2015, to the terrible shipwreck in the Mediterranean that caused more than a thousand victims - most of them unidentified - but Cristina Cattaneo, the medical examiner who in recent years has been involved in recognizing the bodies of migrants drowned at sea and who decided to collect many of these stories of migration in a book entitled Shipwreck without a face (Cortina Editore). To the general public, however, the story came thanks to a cartoon by Makkox, the illustrator who enriches the pages of L'Espresso and who on January 11 on Il Foglio had dedicated a cartoon to the boy without a name.

    During an autopsy, Cristina Cattaneo, a medical examiner, finds a carefully folded report sheet, sewn into the poor pocket of a fourteen-year-old from Mali, drowned during the passage in the Mediterranean: the hope of her journey to Europe.

    - MRita Gallozzi (@GallozziMrita) 16 January 2019


Cattaneo's book reads that the teenager ""was dressed in a jacket similar to a down jacket, a vest, a shirt and jeans"" and that the only way to go back to his age was to analyze the remains. He had no documents to establish his identity, but he had sewn something even more precious into his jacket: a school report book. In a passage of the book Cattaneo tells the moments of the discovery, with the envelope of paper faded and folded on itself that reported the names of the subjects, in French.

We do not know - and we will probably never know - the reasons that led the boy to keep the document with such care. He probably considered it his ticket to a better life, a pass to be accepted into the community he dreamed of reaching. The practical demonstration that he was not ""just"" a migrant, but a human being with a history, even a school history. A story that today has become the symbol of the journeys of hope, a warning that tragedies like this never happen again.

An expectation unfortunately disregarded, as the data indicate. According to UNHCR, 1,311 people died or were missing in the Mediterranean in 2018 alone, more than 55 per thousand arrivals.

Consider our starting base in 1990. We were times poorer than Czechia, they were to us then what Germany is to us now. Now we’re basically on their level, we’ve caught up despite them also having significant growth AT THAT.

Also, the important thing is how fast we’re catching up with the rest of Europe. A 20 pp. increase in our relative GDP per capita PPP to EU28 in just 10 years is certainly very impressive regardless of our base.

America’s GDP growth during the last 10 years, aside from the slowdowns and decreases during the Great Recession, stayed mostly in the 2-3% range, which isn’t that impressive on its own (though when comparing to other much smaller developed economies like Germany’s growths for example, it is).

And citing China is just bad. They’re fueling their growth by reckless government spending and reckless credits. It’s a bubble.

Australia’s GDP per capita PPP was $41k in 2007 and $44.5k in 2017, meaning an 8.5% increase over 10 years. Compare that to the 80% increase by Poland. How’s Australia’s growth more impressive then?

5598,"You seem to be missing the forest for the trees. ""**Faster** population growth would require higher international net immigration into Ireland."" That is not a stated goal, they are saying that the population would grow faster than 1 million if there was a higher international net immigration.

Here it is in full contest: 

&gt;The scenario presented in this chapter is a useful baseline to assess the
desirability of the projected development patterns, and allows policymakers to
consider appropriate measures to alter the development paths. As indicated
above, the projections produced in this chapter and the next are consistent with
the economic and demographic scenario produced as part of the ESRI Economic
Outlook (see Bergin et al., 2016a). This national baseline constitutes a favourable
economic development with GDP growth of 3 per cent or more per annum, and
international migration patterns to match this positive economic environment.
No other consistent economic and demographic scenario is available, so while
higher or lower growth population scenarios could be constructed, corresponding scenarios and implications
projections for employment and jobs are not available. Given the demographic
structure of Ireland and fertility and mortality trends, faster population growth
would require higher international net immigration into Ireland. This would only
arise if Ireland were sufficiently attractive economically and if migrants could find
accommodation at affordable prices. Increasing the number of immigrants would,
holding all other factors constant, result in higher house prices, which would thus
act to reduce immigration flows.""

The part you've taken out of context is saying that there could be a larger increase from 1 million if Ireland's economy continued to grow and if more foreign talent was attracted as a result. It also points out that housing supply issues may also lead to a reduction in immigration.

&gt;On
average, the natural increase decreased by 25 per cent since peaking. The decline
in the natural increase ranges across the regions from 19 per cent in Dublin to 37
per cent in the South-East. This implies that the average age across the
population will increase more rapidly than has been the case and that unless
immigration increases, overall population growth will slow.

Here again it's taken out of context, population growth has fallen by 25%, so instead of the increase over the next 20 years being over 1 million as in the previous 20 years, they are saying it will increase by 1 million, and if there was an increase in immigration it would cause a faster population growth, which shouldn't be a surprise to anyone.

&gt; that Stefan Moly dude on YouTube breaks it down well.

No he doesn't. he misrepresented the report to make it seem like the government is planning on bringing in a million people from Africa. If you read the report it is very clear that the immigration would be caused by an improving economy and as such the migration would be of skilled workers mainly from other areas of the EU. You've been swindled by a right wing demagogue.

The example that you used was a people travelling thousands of miles across continents to settle in a part of the world that they're not native to which is incomparable.

The Albanians/ Kosovans are native to that part of the Balkans, the state of Serbia came into existence after Albanians became an Ethnosocial group.

Kosovo is something like 95% Muslim, and Albanian is the language of 95% of the population, Serbian is spoken by about 1.6% of the population, which is even less than Bosnian at roughly 1.7%.

From those figures it's quite easy to work out that ethnic Serbs only make up a small fraction of the population of Kosovo.

So, you tell me, why does Serbia want Kosovo so badly, it's certainly not brotherly love for the Albanians, perhaps it's resources? Security? Or just plain old Serbian national pride?

5609,"&gt; Exactly. The US income inequality and poverty rates is on the rate of third-world nations.

Did I claim they will reach US level of homicides? Just that with more guns that homicide rate will increase. A point to consider is that total crime rates (theft, robbery,assault) are not that off between France and US. In fact there are more assaults (per capita) in France than the US. Wonder why homicides are so wildly different. 

&gt;Gun ownership in Switzerland is a right under the 1997 Weapons act. Deal with it. It is not a privilege.

Funny thing, the whole point of this thread, I don't have to deal with it: The Swiss have to deal with it not being a right in EU. 

&gt;Prove it. The most gun-saturated nations in Europe have some of the lowest homicide rates. Legally owned guns are seldom used in crime. As it stands the vast majority are illegally smuggled in from outside the EU from failed ex-socialist nations.

I already showed that Czechia's homicide rate halved while there was no change in gun laws. 

Also thank you for proving my point with UK data. UK Homicide rate in 2016 (last data in UN site) was lower than it was on 1997. There was a sharp increase 2 years after 1997, which you attribute to the gun ban. I suppose in 2002 they changed the gun laws again.

&gt;It is made easier thanks to the laughable border controls of Schengen.

There are no border controls in Schengen. The periphery countries still have borders to the non Schengen countries. Nowadays it's Hungary (tough on immigrants! maybe not so tough on gun smugglers), in the past it was Austria. 

This is the whole point reduce the total number of guns inside the Scengen zone so you only have to deal with the smuggled guns. Which were also not created to be smuggled to the EU. Yet it did happen eventually.

&gt;Gun control is a slippery slope. There is no ""compromise"" with the leftists on this issue.

A slippery slope to what? Also Canada is your country, you can do as you (all) please. We are talking about EU here (and Switzerland that wants to have open borders with it). There is no compromise here either.

&gt;They actually filed a lawsuit and passed a right to bear arms in their laws.

The lawsuit was on 2017. 2006 homicide rate 1.3. 2016 rate 0.6. Similar gun laws since 1995. It's not the gun law that brought Czechia murder rates among the lowest in EU.

The one's that are beyond a joke are the one's born here in Australia who have never stepped foot in Serbia or the Serbian dense parts of Croatia where their parents are from. Yet they always wave 3 fingers around yelling Serbia, Serbia !!! So many of them wear Serb shirts with large Cyrillic writing on them but don't even know how to read or write in it. 

&amp;#x200B;

It is the same with the Croatians here too. I know a very pathetic one who is only half Croatian. His mum is Aussie and his Dad is some where from Dalmacija. He can't speak the language albeit just a few swear words. Yet is always wearing Croatian jerseys, hats, putting the flag in his car etc...I am thinking to myself what the fuck is going on in your head? 

&amp;#x200B;

Now don't get me started on the religious crap that comes with national pride crap. Every single person in the church I used to go to has never read the bible. How fucken pathetic, showing up to the same church year in year out and they do this their whole life and they don't even know any of the religious stories etc...Yet here they are at a church claiming that they are religious are fasting up comes Easter and Christmas. Please read the fucken Bible, make up your own opinion then. Don't feel obliged to be there because you might get judged by the village patrol or the fashion brigade as I call it these days as everyone shows up for these big festivities such as Christmas dressed in mini skirts or other outfits ready to go to a night club.

If Americans or non-Americans want to brag about the US achievements in World War 2 they should mention the pacific theather, in which they liberated the entire pacific and south-east Asia almost singlehandedly, not Europe. Europe, like the Napoleonic wars, was the work of a coalition and most of the work was done by the Soviets and Britain and its overseas possessions. I'm not going to value the economic price tag of the war over the loss of the lives of people. That's just inhumane.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I am American. I do not doubt that the Soviets would have won the war if the US had not invaded. But if the US had not invaded, then you would be seeing Soviet Troops in Western European capitals instead of American troops. They would have turned you all into communist puppet states just like they did to Eastern Europe and East Germany.

&amp;#x200B;

The UK and Canada had no capability to fight Germany and Italy by themselves. During the Battle of the Bulge, there were 40 American soldiers for each British solider. Even if the UK had invaded alone, the Soviets would have turned on them and steamrolled the British if they were just against the British. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The UK was a poor and strangled country during World War II. The only reason their military was kept alfoat was because of indsutrial production in the US anyway. They didn't have the men. 

&amp;#x200B;

The UK would never have sent their whole army alone against Germany. It would have been a blood bath either way. The only reason it worked with the US was because the allies had millions of extra men in Western Europe which made the war infitienly harder on Germany because it's hard to outflank 2 million men, but a few hundred thousand british soldiers can be caputered completely",,/r/europe/comments/ahensy/eu_states_boycott_iran_summit_us_called_in_poland/eefm5bs/,sandyhands2,1547900004

5651,"That's true. I became nationalist and racist with 16 when 12 Turkish people did beat me up for no reason after visiting the swimming bath. The starting line of their fight was ""You looked at my sister?"" and I said ""No? When, who, where?"". But that was the last thing I could say. I woke up in the hospital. From that day on I hated them a lot.

By the way, I am not racist anymore. But still nationalist. It's just that I learned to differenciate. Mainly because I met someone who is now my best friend, and he is German with Turkish roots, although a German nationalist as well, like I am, he's just one with Turklish roots and well accepted in our circle.

So, I do agree with you. You're not born as a racist, you're made a racist.

&gt; Ability to make trade deals in the transition period.

You can negotiate and sign all the deals you want, they just can only start when the transition period ends. To do otherwise means the UK would have two deals simultaneously with some other country, does that mean that that country can choose under which deal they import/export to the EU/UK? What about countries then using the UK to do an end-run around the EU trade deal? It also means the UK has no incentive to keep the transition period short. The transition period is already legally dodgy, since the EU has to convince all it's partners to treat the UK as if it's in the EU when it really isn't. We just hope nobody complains too hard.

&gt; Northern Ireland backstop must be made temporary to force both UK and EU to a fair settlement.

The backstop *is* temporary, it says so quite explicitly. I think you mean you want some kind of fixed deadline. I'm surprised, if you look at the effect of letting the clock run down now that you'd want that for the backstop.

In any case the backstop is far worse for the EU than the UK, so I think it's actually leverage for the UK rather than the other way round. The UK gets a full customs union with the EU, while not having freedom of movement. Isn't that exactly what you wanted?

&gt; Britain will not be a permanent rule taker, unable to leave the single market.

You are leaving the single market, together with its four freedoms. That's exactly what the withdrawal agreement does.

Second, the Americans had economic and military interests in Europe so to say that Germany posed no ""threat"" to the US isn't quite accurate. They may not have been a military threat to the US mainland, but they were a major threat to American interests so they would've intervened regardless of the German threat to the mainland. 

Third, I'm not going to disagree with the Marshall plan and it was a great help that we repaid by being Americas ally for the entire Cold War. Believe me, if the US had no economic or political interests in western Europe, the Marshall plan would not have happened at all. The world isn't some game of morals and good deeds and the US is far from a morally rightious and just nation. It's political realism at its finest. Not that we shouldn't be thankful for it, but the Cold War is over and we're not supposed to side with America for all eternity just because they pushed the Germans out more than 70 years ago. How long did we thank the victorious powers of the Napoleonic wars for defeating the French after they invaded the Netherlands in 1795 and annexed the country in 1810? Definitely not 70+ years.

Fourth, sending troops to Afghanistan was a mistake of epic proportions. It only furthered the goals of extremists and plunged the country into even more chaos. UN missions aren't obligatory and to send our countrymen under a UN flag to destabilize a country because they won't extradite 1 single person is ridiculous. Yes, the 9/11 attacks were horrible but terrorist attacks happen everywhere and just because the US *has* the capability to invade a foreign power and enforce their will doesn't mean that they *should*. If the attack was directly ordered by the Afghani government, it would've been a souvereign attack on a fellow NATO member, in which case sending troops would've been entirely justified. But it wasn't.

And finally, isolationism isn't happening at all thanks to the EU. Not sending troops to aid American interests isn't being isolationist, it's just choosing not to send troops because it's not our war.

Nonetheless, Poland, as well as all of the satellite states, had the benefit of still remaining the same country with same borders, while Baltics also dealt with a whole intertwined country collapsing, in addition to the otherwise massive societal and economic changes.

Attempted murder is down as well though, not sure why you chose to ignore that section:

&gt;According to Brå's annual statistics, the number of attempted murders reported in Malmö dropped by nearly half, from 100 in 2017 to 55 in 2018, the lowest number since 2013. 

About a year ago /u/Jabadabaduh posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/7isy50/comparison_of_homicide_rates_of_malm%C3%B6_with_a/) comparison of Malmö with a few other cities when it comes to homicide.

All in all the population is up by 30% since 1998, *attempted* murder rate is cut in half since 2017 (might have been a high year, who knows), reported robberies down 18% since 2017 (down 40% since 1998), reported rapes up 10% since last year.

As a sidenote (I was curious if the latter is a high or low rate for Sweden), the Swedish average was 73 reported rapes per 100,000 citizens in 2017. Average for a city of the size of Malmö (312k inhabitants) should be 227 cases, it's pretty much just in line with the national average.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/ahdt51/malmö_sees_lowest_crime_stats_in_17_years_new/eefb0fr/,rEvolutionTU,1547886826

5955,"&gt; This is also was one of the reasons why in Poland in early 90s government shuted down all PGRs (state owned farms), but did not touch mines or shipyards, which were equally or even less profitable than PGRs.

And also the reason why Polish government is hemorrhaging money supporting mines and shipyards, despite there being absolutely no reason to do so other than constant threat of violence issued by miners and shipyard workers at any suggestion of restructurisation.

You're also off the mark about profits: not only were some PGR profitable, the entire PGR system was profitable by the end of 1980s and start of 1990s thanks to minority of estates carrying the rest. Despite that basically all were sold at very ""preferential"" prices or given away (with Catholic Church being biggest beneficiary).

\&gt;  There was no tradition of fight in PGRs, no self organisation, they were basically defensless. It was also evident during Solidarity era, PGRs did not joined protest so efficiently. 

Funnily enough your idea about PGR is absolutely false. The reason why they didn't join the protests was mostly because PGR workers living conditions were significantly better than that of factory workers. They were largely not affected by food shortages, rationaing etc. PGR workers organized as easily or even easier than factory workers, and any time they did protests their demands were quickly met by government.

The very idea that somehow farmers lack self organization is ridiculous anyways... just look at politics in 90s. Samoobrona was direct result of PGR dissolution and by mid-90s were organizing extremely disruptive and impactful protests that - in long run - led to them being elected to Parliment. Another example is PSL, which only relatively recently became ""mainstream"" and again back in 1990s functioned very much as a ""farmers party"", except with less combative and more left-leaning character than Samoobrona.",Poland,/r/europe/comments/ahdenw/this_daily_mail_front_page_was_printed_two_years/eef5fyg/,Fresherty,1547880565
