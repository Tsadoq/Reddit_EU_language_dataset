10,"&gt;it may be annoying to see more and more gay people affirm being gay is a part of personality

After being told your whole life that being gay is bad, and hiding the fact that you're gay because of fear, I think it's reasonable to make that part of you more visible, once you feel comfortable coming out. 

&gt;this flag is nothing but a modern way to divide people between the gays and the straights

So if an oppressed minority is allowed to represent itself through a flag, then a division is being created? That's... not how logic works.

Oh and also

&gt;that are just fed up with gay people that define themselves as gay first than anything else

It's really easy for you to say that, since your sexuality isn't being actively violated by laws that don't allow you to marry or adopt children, things you might take for granted.

88,"It's production, not income.

People had housing, utilities worked but with some disruptions. Basic requirements were always met. Things were super cheap. I remember around in 1994 I was helping my mom with groceries and once a week I would make a few trips to get everything on a long list that doesn't differ too much from my today's lists, and it cost me around 40MDL, which by today's exchange rates is around 2 Euros. Family of 4. Of course if you take the exchange rate from back then, then it's close to 8$.

I guess one thing to note is that Moldova didn't have millionaires back then. Everyone was almost equally poor. But differentiation quickly took off thanks to corruption.

The social norm was not to throw anything away. Plastic bags were washed and reused. Clothes were mended and worn carefully, and you never wear good clothes at home. Clothes for kids were passed down from kid to kid in the entire extended family. Some of my clothes came from my mom's cousin's son, as he grew out of them. Some clothes didn't fit well, but they did their job. We also wasted no food. Eating every bit of the chicken in some way, and finding ways to cook it best. Even bones were boiled enough to extract at least flavor for vegetable soups. People grew their own stuff quite often since it was mainly an agricultural economy. We grew our own potatoes on a patch of land near the landing strip on the airport's territory, where we got to through a hole in the wall around the airport, and we weren't alone, we divided the land like civilized people and used strings on sticks to mark the borders.

I don’t envy rich people, if they made money through work and innovation, ideally without exploiting others. The Spanish monarchy does cost public money, 8 million euros annually. In what way is the king better from ordinary people? Why does he deserve that money? Birth is not a legitimate source of rule. The last king turned out to be a corrupt crook and does not have popular support. Isn’t that enough? You might say that Juan Carlos made the transition to democracy possible. I might say that the transition was unavoidable and the peaceful one that happened was immoral by preserving the privileges and a comfy position of the ancien régime. If the king could truly be the conciliatory arbiter of politics it could make sense.

I know our local media in France try to paint ""Turkey"" bad picture, but here are the facts:

**Fact 1:** Turkey is not the only NATO member who purchased Russian military equipment.

Source: [S300 source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-300_missile_system), quote below

&gt;The S-300 is regarded as one of the most potent [anti-aircraft missile systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface-to-air_missile) currently fielded. It is mainly used in Asia and Eastern Europe, including three [NATO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO) member countries: [Bulgaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgaria), [Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece) and [Slovakia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovakia)

**Fact 2:** Turkey is combatting Russia across the region (Syria, Libya, Armenia, Ukraine...). They have armed forces on the ground for Syria, Libya and in Azerbaijan, they have signed military agreements with Ukraine. They have just conducted a military drill with the participation of the US in the Black Sea. It also included Spain and other European countries. They are planning to do a regular joint military patrol in Black Sea.

Source: [Nato link](https://mc.nato.int/media-centre/news/2020/nato-forces-participate-in-sea-breeze-exercise-in-the-black-sea)

I know as a country we have a strong military, and we might have better power projection capabilities than Turkey. That unfortunately does not change the fact that they are already projecting power for OTAN and US interests.

Oftentimes, realpolitik is not as black and white as the media claims but I can tell you for sure there are European and NATO leaders that are happy that Turkey is combatting Russian influence. The key evidence is that EU's response is usually a strong-worded letter and not a single meaningful action.

As for our country, I hope you are aware that our president is trying to save the interests of French energy companies in Libya and in eastern Med. He is not taking Greece's side out of morality or ethics, but from a strictly business perspective.

350,"Well, it's been day 2 of relative peace and quiet. Several state-run institutions all over the country went on strikes, local government officials like mayors tried to talk to them, but in all ""dialogues"" they stubbornly refuse to acknowledge that elections were rigged, or that people want Lukashenko gone, or even that riot police was exceedingly brutal towards pretty much anyone who was on the streets Aug 9 - Aug 13.

Lukashenko himself keeps saying that it's only some minority of 20 or so people tries to go on a strike, and keeps claming tyat a very small minority of people are rioting because of some influence from outside the country.

Meanwhile the protests themselves are all very peaceful ever since police stopped detaining people. Peoplewalk around with flowers, laugh and dance, some are spreading free water and treats amongst the crowd, some offering tea and coffee, there even were guys playing chess on the grass. There's no rioting, no breaking of shops and cars, no arsons, it feels more like a nation-wide holiday.

At the same time, people watch in horror as the detained are now released. Okrestina isolator where most of the detained were held basically looks like Auschwitz. Volounteers offer the released to bring them home, but more often than not they have to drive them to hospitals instead. Here's a news article about some of the victims, it's in russian, but there are some (pretty graphic) photos: https://news.tut.by/society/696687.html Victims report starving, constant sadistic beatings, cramming over 30 people into 8-man room, people laying in pools of their own blood, threats of rape and murder.

Your reaction doesn't help but actually create more polarisation, which makes it part of the problem, not the solution.

Edit: I just wondered are parents to be praised when kids behave to your standards?  What influence do you think their environment (peers, social-economic, education) has? At what age are they to be judged on their own responsibility? To what degree do you blame their grandparents? Aunts/uncles? Cousins?

Edit2: as a parent myself I realize how mind boggling mamy mistakes you can make and I really think that at least the majority of those parents only did what they thought is best for their children. There are always people, like you, who think they can judge others upbringing by oversimplifying and projecting their own upbringing and standards. Please keep this in mind in the future before judging, or beter refrain from judging altogether since you're almost never in the proper position to do that.

I do disagree with the opening poster that the two pictures in the topic show a different standard between what is accepted from Greece compared to what is accepted from the UK. The UK does have an EEZ that extends as far from it's islands as it extends from it's mainland, just like Greece, like you can see when you look at the map and the location of the Orkneys and the Outer Hebrides. Even the pictures that supposedly should show a bigger EEZ for Greece don't do so. But your pictures doesn't show a different EEZ from his picture.

What your picture adds is that you show more proof that there is no double standard because it also shows the EEZ for the Channel Islands, which follows the same rules as all the other EEZs.

Turkey's problem is not with the EEZ rules, it is with the fact that Greece apparently has all those islands very near the Turkish coast within it's countries borders.

504,"There is a lot to say about what you write, and I feel this goes a bit beyond what can be achieved in a reddit forum, but I will just write down some thoughts here.

(1) The sad truth is that noone, neither the EU nor the US, will start WW3 with Russia over Ukraine. This means that for the moment Ukraine will untimately be stuck between Russia and the EU. The only realistic hope is probably that by means of a very gradual and long-term shift towards the EU (so gradual that Russia cannot really go against it) Ukraine will be able to become part of the EU at a moment where Russia is so weak that it can't prevent this from happening. 30 years ago there was a small window of opportunity for the Baltic states to cut ties with Russia and to make a clear decision for the EU. At that point of time Russia, for internal reasons, was too weak to go against it. Unfortunately, at that point of time Ukraine was torn between its Western and its Russia ""soul"" (for lack of a better word) and was not able (for various reasons -- I am not judging this here, this is for historians to decide) to make such a clear-cut decision for the West. So now, for the moment at least, Ukraine is stuck, and there is no easy way out without starting WW3. Russia knows this, the EU knows this, and the US know this. Otherwise the Krimea problem and the problem in the Eastern parts of Ukraine would have already been solved, in one way or another.

(2)  Obviously, a major reason that prevents Ukraine from becoming more independent from Russia are Russian gas deliveries. Unfortunately, there is no easy way out of this either because the price Ukraine pays to Russia for the gas is so low (IIRC half the price on the EU market, but I am not insisting on a number her) that Ukraine can't just switch gas providers. 

(3) NS2 does not change this setting at all. What happened last time Ukraine had a gas dispute with Russia (a couple of years ago, which led to the Berlin contract in 2019)? Russia cut down gas meant for the Ukraine and the only (legal) option was for Ukraine to buy gas (meant for EU countries) from the EU companies that had delivery contracts with Russia. In this case the gas was already physically present in Ukraine (because it was transiting there), but this is a minor aspect. With NS2 some of the gas would not be physically present in Ukraine anymore, of course, but the principle would be the same: Ukraine has to buy gas from European gas companies if Russia cuts down supplies.  If this gas is physically present in Ukraine or gets delivered via the EU border does not make any strategic difference. (Unless the strategy is to blackmail the EU by stealing gas, but Ukraine cannot afford this strategy because ultimately the EU would get the gas from elsewhere and not take Ukraine seriously as a partner for solving the problem. And then Ukraine would be alone.) 

(4) Currently EU has influence on Russia precisely because the are strong economic ties, including the gas contracts, of course. This is why the EU could contribute to solving the recent gas conflict, which led to the Berlin treaty last year. Unfortunately, the EU influence on Russia is declining. First because all EU countries (including Germany) are working on getting more independent from Russian energy supplies. One reason is the complete transition to renewables within the next 30 years, another one is that LNG capacities are being built up across Europe, and another one is that there are plans to source gas via pipelines from countries other than Russia.  Second because China is increasingly buying Russian gas, with tthe result that trade with the EU will become less and less important for Russia's financial bottom line. So in a long-term perspective, EU influence on Russia is pretty limited, and the current economic ties between Russia and the EU are an advantage for solving problems, not a disadvantage. 

Now, let's use this background for looking at your following statement:

&gt; This shouldn't be the goal of sanctions. The goal should be crippling their economies and making them weaker, less efficient in their attacks on others.

Let's now assume the EU cut down all economic ties with Russia immediately (which is not possible, just ask Poland or other Central/Eastern European countries, who depend much more on Russian gas than Germany does). This would obviously cripple Russia the most. Would this make Ukraine's position any better? Ukraine would still depend on cheap Russian gas and Russia would be even more keen on keeping Ukraine in its sphere of influence. The sad truth is, there is no easy way out.

The only serious option is to use the current (temporary!) economic influence of the EU on Russia to make the situation as bearable as possible. The 2019 gas treaty is an example of what this can practically mean. Confrontation for confrontation's sake or for symbolic purposes, however, is no solution, and avoiding these is not equal to appeasement.

Finally, to avoid misunderstandings: I have no doubt that the EU will, sooner or later, increase sanctions on both Russia and Turkey. As I said, the current economic ties are precisely what makes this possible.",Berlin,/r/europe/comments/i9sfsn/during_eu_teleconference_greece_and_germany/g1i6tdz/,nibbler666,1597452336

655,"I didn't knew their HDI is so high, I was basing my assumptions on discussions with Irish colleagues, so anecdotal evidence about their salaries not matching with GDP.

But if you look at average net salaries, they are behind Germany, Denmark, Netherlands, Sweden, Finland.
Their GDP pe capita is much higher though, it's only beaten by Luxemburg, Switzerland and Norway.

So back to the original question, Ireland has a higher GDP per capita but less salary than Germany, Denmark, Netherlands, Sweden, Finland (just in Europe, I didn't look further)



So what I said still stands, depends who you ask, maybe younger working people care more about salary than HDI, which tends to help more people without good jobs or older etc.

Turkey will not get special treatment against the law purely because they have a sizeable fleet. And disrespecting the law and what lawfully belongs to other nations will always be met with negative responses.

Any objections or any requests for exemptions to the international law can only be discussed in a court of law and not at gunpoint as Turkey is currently doing. 

If Turkey believe that their claim is reasonable then they should take it to Hague yesterday. 

The problem is that Turkey's claim even if met with a positive response, will only grant them a small part of what they claim, still making them irrelevant to the happenings in East Med.

751,"&gt; I don't think we could remain the one and only contested superpower, even if we wanted to. Those days are done. 

I agree with this. But this still leaves the question of how much power the US wants to cede to China voluntarily, without any need. China is already powerful, so maybe it is a good idea not to make them too powerful too fast, by giving up power and serving influence to China with a silver spoon. 

Regarding the ME, it's way more complex. It's not just about oil. The Western role in the ME is both shameful and stabilizing. So it is not clear what will happen without Western countries being involved.

Regarding Africa, this continent is also important due to natural ressources. So again, there is no easy answer here.

I, too, hope that the US and Europe will stay close allies, and I do hope that some day the values of the Enlightenment will play a bigger role in the US as it is curently the case.

I have no doubt that Europe will beef itself up militarily, but this is a long process (think in terms of decades), because militarily, European unity will take some time.

The idea is that the citizenship always has a social safety net, allowing them to easier quit shitty jobs as they won't have to fear financial ruin, additionally both the governments and citizens no longer need to deal with any form of beurocracy, so there is a lot of savings (time for citizens money for state) there.

The idea is to prepare for a world in which EVERYTHING is 100% automated... in other words: like 80% of your population is unemployed since jobs no longer exist, human labor has made itself entirely obsolete. Yeah those that do manage to get jobs can earn something on top of it all. However this also relies on a good taxation of companies.

tl;dr: all welfare programs are combined into one and apply to everyone equally. It's a model to prepare for a world were the robot overlords made jobs nonexistent.

edit: also to mention: a lot of (specifically right wing) news, like to sneer at testing programs when they don't improve employment... to reiterate, improving employment is NOT their purpose since it is meant for a jobless society anyhow. It's purpose is to allow a minimum standard of living for everyone and improve mental health by removing the constant anxiety of ""if I lose my job I will live on the streets"". The trials have very much confirmed an improvement on the mental health part.",,/r/europe/comments/i9qku5/support_of_ubi_in_eu_countries/g1hg5as/,Timey16,1597438500

You see, we not even started a discussion yet, and you are already justifying Hitler and insulting me. If anyone doesn't deserve a debate after that, it's you.

&amp;#x200B;

After all, if you were even a little interested in my real position, and would not be satisfied exclusively with my narrow fantasies,  you would have asked me and found out that I am not a homophobe. I have a normal attitude towards gays and consider them to be the same people as myself. But instead, you decided to hang a convenient label on me and accuse me of homophobia solely on the basis of your subjective fantasies. And your cowardly stance with a quiet edit of your comment, and your conclusions drawn from thin air, says a lot about you. Therefore, you are right. One of us doesn't deserve a discussion. And it's you.

&amp;#x200B;

And I wondered why there is no flag of homophobes because I advocate complete freedom of any opinions and self-expression as long as it does not harm others. A person has every right to be homophobic and have any beliefs. As long as he does not harm others, this is normal.  Anyone should have the right to express their position and not be afraid for their life after that. Do you think there are no homophobes in Budapest? You can find them everywhere. And if you ban them, they will not change their views or disappear. The prohibition to have such an opinion is exactly the same infringement of rights as the prohibition to be homosexual. And when the mayor of Budapest says ""Budapest for all"" I expect that Budapest is valid for everyone. Otherwise, it is hypocrisy.

By giving free money to people plenty of people who currently work in jobs they don't like they will just quit them, another big chunk of people (like me for example) will do everything to work on a ""black/grey market"" so I will earn slightly more/same money but will not pay taxes... or will completely stop working (why should I if I get free money?)

867,"As someone from Northern Ireland I can share the sentiment. I noticed some time ago when talking to friends from other European countries, for some reason when referring to Europe I would exclude the British Isles as part of it. I believe the reason why we don't ""feel"" as European compared to others, and when I say we, I mean all of the British Isles, is because we largely are influenced by Trans Atlantic culture due to the fact we all speak English so we naturally tend to consume more American media than perhaps mainland Europeans do. We consist of island nations that while we were never really ""isolated"", we were never in the sphere of influence other European countries had on each other as well.

 That being said, I'm not saying just because we don't ""feel it"" doesn't mean we aren't. Of course geographically we are a part of it but culturally it seem almost like we are a separate entity in between both the United States and the big cluster of countries in mainland Europe, while I do believe most of us do not a hundred percent identify with either I do think we can be described as something different altogether, almost like half american, half european, somewhere in between the two.",Northern Ireland,/r/europe/comments/i9ptbi/do_any_other_irish_people_not_really_feel_european/g1h035y/,TheLastBaronet,1597431247

886,"The question is, what strategic goals need to be met by the military? A military is simply a tool - and whilst it could be put to many different uses once it exists, it is not a cheap tool to create or maintain. 

That cost comes at the expense of other things - education, research, healthcare infrastructure, diplomatic missions, etc. Germany's military might be a ""joke"", but it is highly respected in every other field - at least from this foreigner's point of view. But back to strategy. 

Regionally Germany is already the dominant power thanks to its position of wealth in the EU. A military that could protect power here might help only in a couple of specific instances, such as Russian aggression in the Baltics or peacekeeping missions in the Balkans. A fleet that could assist with migrant boats in the Med' and Russia in the Baltic could also be useful. 

Any strategic goals outside of Europe would require a far more substantial navy. Yet unlike France or Britain, Germany has no global territorial interests, and perhaps because of this and its relative pacifism it has built a reputation as a voice of justice in the world. A stronger conventional army might jeopardise this. 

Pretty much the only global asset that Germany needs to protect is its prowess in manufacturing &amp; research.

909,"&gt;Why don’t you do it if you think Palestinians are being treated so badly?

 I don't think a 'right' country should do the 'right' thing always. Geopolitics doesnt' care about right or wrong, it cares about interests and power. For example, North Korea may think they were right in the beginning, but look how the gap increased with South Korea (leaving aside the dumb decisions they did upon themselves). Being cut out of the hegemony has its price. Sometimes it's better to accept a 'McDonalds' in your country than pushing your own brand forward. You make up a balance between advantages and disadvantages.  
Turkey cutting all ties means it will get very heavy sanctions that UAE didn't have to begin with.

 

&gt;Reminds me of Turkish treatment of Kurds. Even their language was banned until recently which never happened in Israel. Kurdish politicians are arrested and still in prison.  
&gt;  
&gt;Its funny how hypocritical some Turks are when it comes to Israel-Palestine issue and can’t see some similarities. Israel also to my knowledge doesn’t ban Arab parties or arrest their MP’s unlike Turkey does to Kurds.

A US-backed militairy dictator (Kenan Evren) banned Kurdish from school tortured Kurds in prison (a.k.a giving life to PKK), and also banned Islamic stuff like headscarve (a.k.a giving life to Erdogan's movement).   
Kurdish politicians aren't arrested. Pro-violence Kurds are arrested like PKK. I don't know why you equate a whole ethnicity to a radical marxist organization. It's racist. It's like talking about ""Americans"" when refering to the KKK.

I for example don't like bashing Erdogan with foreigners. It's completely fine when I do it with my countrymen but when foreigners do I take it almost personally, because I believe that it's my right and responsibility to call his bullshit out, not yours.

I think this kind of behavior is not common at all in Europe. I have never seen it in Germany f.e., instead I have heard of Bundeswehr should be abolished (because it's unnecessary expense). Because of this, I feel, most people think that Turkish people are nationalistic (claiming their nation to be better than others), in fact we shit on ourselves very very often, but when it comes to others shitting on us we become defensive, aggressive. Because of this however we get marked as imperialist, aggressive, (overly) nationalist. 

My anecdotal experience in  this sub with other Turks is that they are never the first aggressor in  the heated ""debates"", they are almost always replying to an accusation about Turkey, defending the country. Never seen one, myself included, attacking another without provocation (and I must admit, there are lots of them in this sub). 

Unfortunately though I presume that this comment will be brushed off or downvoted but I felt like getting my thoughts across. Cheers",,/r/europe/comments/i8y2h2/turkey_on_brink_of_recession_as_economy_collapses/g1gims9/,themiraclemaker,1597423628

It would be. Most Russians sympathise with the protesters and Belarus is generally seen positively. Also, the protests aren't against Russia or Russian influence per se, unlike Maidan (where the lines were much clearer in favour of EU association).

Russia's also in a much weaker position than it was six years ago, and Belarus is eight times the size of Crimea and would expose Russia to hundreds of miles of NATO border, so its military would be massively stretched.

Around 50% of imports into Belarus come from Russia, and 50% of exports go there, with the country essentially being subsidised by the Kremlin, so a few nationalists aside, most opposition leaders know how dependent on Russia the country is, so views are generally much more nuanced. The main opposition figure that got arrested before the elections, Babaryka, was largely seen as pro-Russian.

1011,"I suspect it’s because a lot of former British colonies adopt a parliamentary-style government, instead of a republican model (i.e. the one used in the United States). It seems to circumvent the development of a two-party system, too, as most parliamentary democracies have at least three or four major parties that actually win seats.

I think parliamentary procedures (like requiring the Prime Minister to stand for question period, having shadow ministers from the Opposition, etc) also enhance visibility and make it harder for any one party to have a 100% blank cheque to do whatever they want. Of course there are major exceptions, but Trump’s presidency really solidified the problems with a republic-style government that puts one leader in charge of all 3 branches of government.",,/r/europe/comments/i9gmsy/how_romania_has_developed_from_1990_to_2020/g1g2tig/,MillenialPopTart2,1597416398

And you have no evidence that it's a Swedish thing to abuse women which you throw out all the time. In terms of equality and the wellness of women Sweden rate among the highest in the world. 

And I know your type, you like to shout racist fascist nazi blablabla whilst failing to understand the definition of those words. The only thing I've said that could be interpreted as racist is blaming high rape numbers on immigrants, but that's beacuse it's true, I know the situation in my country.

Thank you for your service (unironically).

Theres an old joke here about someone asking directions to get somewhere and being told ""well if you want to go there - I wouldn't start from here"". I think it's exactly the situation in the world regarding wars. It's damn important to prevent the conditions which end up as wars and once you get to the point where a war is likely it's very difficult to avoid it. This should be the number 1 priority of politicians and in those places where we can actually control who gets into power - should be voters first thought. Unfortunately it's often not.

The Balkans is the classic example - centuries of conflict have left open wounds and when the circumstances are wrong these turn into open conflict. It's worrying the shift into right wing thinking which a lot of places are seeing round the world at the minute. Perhaps part of the issue is the last generation which saw war affecting their own country is dieing off in the west.",Ireland,/r/europe/comments/i9gmsy/how_romania_has_developed_from_1990_to_2020/g1fq61j/,Spoonshape,1597409539

3) Read carefully: Countries with no disputes sign mutual EEZ agreement too. Because only after a mutual agreement its valid and legal liability. You send the coordinates to UN. UNCLOS doesn't provide any country with coordinates. 

4) Greece EEZ can't extend from Kastellorizo. Islands, under certain circumstances, generate only limited EEZ. There are international examples. See for example [Spain-Morocco EEZ](https://i.redd.it/wth2k7uu25a41.jpg).

There's a point somewhere on the balance where this tips from yes to no.

If one side is losing out economically, socially or culturally they will want to be independent. Tito kept these pressures contained at least in part by use of secret police and repression. Once he was gone the people who had family members killed or tortured obviously wanted seperation.

&gt;Honestly Im not surprised that a croat is hating on yugoslavia but we had better living conditions then we have today. 

Serbs might have because you were parasites on Slovenia and Croatia, but for Slovenes and Croats today living conditions are objectively better, standards of living are higher, buying power is higher, quality of life in general is higher.

&gt;Also yugoslav economy was competative on the world market with many comodities being exported. 

If it was competitive it wouldn't have ended up with a hyperinflation in the '80s and almost all production failing when it was opened up to the free market in the '90s. History has shown that Yugoslavian economy was crap.

&gt;Well its becouse minister of economy and other few economists were part of the world bank team known as g17 or something like that. Also yugoslav economy was competative on the world market with many comodities being exported. Also yugoslav army WAS the 4th strongest army but in the 90s it was crushed by the economy which we all know what was like. And the ""newly"" formed crostian army wasnt new at all. Those were all dissidents trained by the american NED and a lot of them are descendents of the croatian ustashas who were hitlers puppet state and fascists. 

Also this is just a giant onspiracy theory.

The army was newly formed and extremely underequipped when compared to Serbian troops, it was only in '94 and '95 that we got actual equipment when Russians started selling us high-grade military hardware like airplanes, helicopters, and SAM systems. Thank God for Russian pilots and Russian Mi-24s, they ensured that Operation Storm went well.

I think they were, Ukraine was the breadbasket of the Soviet Union and they never had such food deficit like we did in Poland at the end of the 1980s and still in 1990 when things only started to slowly get better. On the other hand, life standards in Ukraine sharply decreased in the 1990s and they had their deficits only in this period, but still in 1990 Ukraine was probably ahead of Poland, including simply quality of life. I don't have reliable statistics but since I have some family connections to Ukraine I've heard stories. Also in Ukraine basically all of the country was connected to the gas network, even villages, while in communist Poland it was present only in big cities, most of mid-sized towns got it only in the 2000s and a lot of smaller towns and villagers still don't have gas (which is something that makes Ukrainian immigrants in Poland surprised, for them not having gas is like not having water or electricity).",Poland,/r/europe/comments/i8b1ib/how_poland_has_developed_from_1990_to_2020/g1f8ypo/,Spin53,1597395042

For us the question is ""would you personally go there"" and not if ""would a professional soldier in your country go there"". There is actually quite a bit of difference between those two questions. And then the 2) second reason is perhaps a bit of a myth, but from my international experiences (I have lived on 3 continents and spent several years in total on road) I have found out that for us Finns a promise means something different (on average) than in many other cultures.

Anyhow, I personally identify myself as an European and for me listing a bunch of EU countries and asking separate willingness to defend one and perhaps not another makes little sense.

Generally depression and anxiety and stuff like that builds up as a sort of feedback loop, you become more depressed because you are depressed and so on.

&gt;Legality is what keeps the current world order of globalization intact. If we didn’t have the presence of international laws, then things would be much worse.

Legality is only able to bring stability as long as it can be enforced. Thats why you hear people say that internation ""law"" is more of a guideline than anything. And they are right. Thats exactly why I find this viewpoint reduntant. There never was and never will be a international organization who can enforce its will upon soverign states. The only reason globalization was sustained as long as it did was the invention of the WMD combined with the collapse of the soviet union thus leaving a single hegamon in the whole world. Now that is starting to change, and we can already see globilization starting to slowly crumble.

There's also the issue of is following legality the correct way since it isnt just most of the time. That mindset is what get you distopias after all.

&gt;but pretending like Turkey is a goos guy in all of this is seriously backwards.

I've never said anything close to this, nor have I pretended like Turkey is the good guy. My whole point wad that there were no good guys or bad guys when you look at countries. That is why my claim of Turkey being one of the last countries in the Nato if it ever came to that. Of course it was downvoted to hell cuz why not but I stand my point. 

Organizations like Nato only care about power and goals. As of right now, Turkeys goals are pretty much aligning with Nato and Turkey has the power to work towards those goals.

If you want to look into to the morality of it though, go read my previous comments. I never claimed turkey was ""good"" guy, in fact I think I would put it under the ""more bad than good"" countries if it ever came to that.

&gt;although, I dont know where you got that from.

I mean if all discussion around here were strictly based on legality instead of morality, national pride and underlying racism we would have much more civil discussions here. But sadly we dont.

&gt;Russia has fell from the superpower status and now are a regional power. They have only occupied and seized territory from non-NATO members. Russia would never attempt anything on a NATO partner. 

&gt;Yeah i have no idea what you’re trying to say here.

This is exactly what I have meant. First they come for non-nato countries, then when the time is right they take on Nato.

1725,"&gt; My point about “No True Scotsman” is that people quote it like its some law of physics its not its more like an opinion with as much inherent bias as any opinion might have.

The ""No True Scotsman"" is what may be called a ""informal"" or ""rhetorical"" fallacy. This is to distinguish them from ""formal"" or strictly ""logical"" fallacies that contravene the axioms of what we might call ""everyday logic"" or ""intuitive logic"" (to distinguish it from 
more fanciful logical systems which are deliberately somehow counterintuitive and contain axioms that do not exist within more intuitive systems of logic).

However, the ""No True Scotsman"" does have some basis in formal logic and can be described in set theory. 

The intuition behind the ""No True Scotsman"" fallacy is the realisation that, by changing the extension of a name referring to a set, we can alter the truth value of a premise that makes reference to that set. 

Let [2,4,6,8,10] be a set in our domain. 

The premise: ""There are five even numbers within our set"" would usually be held to be true.

However, if I then add the premise: ""Even numbers are to be defined as those numbers that, when divided by two, yield an integer and are no greater than 7"", then the truth value of the statement ""There are five even numbers within our set"" becomes false. 

The ""No True Scotsman"" fallacy is therefore invoked when someone is perceived as changing the extension of a name in the face of arguments that contradict some premise they have already asserted. For example:

Original claim: ""There are no Russian homosexuals""

Contradictory argument: ""This celebrity is Russian by both birth and nationality and is openly gay"".

Change in extension of set: ""But anyone who is gay is not truly Russian""

My comment was intended as a joke given you were pointing out that Scottish people born in Scotland voted for a certain outcome, thus suggesting ""True Scotsmen"", on the basis of the criterion of their being born in Scotland, voted for an outcome different from the results of the referendum in Scotland. 

The expression ""It's not a law physics"" is a colloquialism that simply entails that a rule is not absolute or without exceptions, as this is how the so-called ""laws of physics"" are understood by laypeople  who don't study physics.  Laws of physics are, however, epistemically complex in a way that the laws of logic are not. 

Rhetorical fallacies, however, by their very nature, do not meet the criteria necessary to be deemed logical fallacies. Many of these so-called ""fallacies"" constitute little more than frequently used rhetorical devices that have historically proved successful in swaying the opinions of crowds. Consequently, they are better convinced of as belonging to the sphere of rhetoric rather than that of logic.

The ""No True Scotsman"" argument, for example, falls short of being a logical fallacy because the extension of a name (in lay terms, what it means) is not a question governed by logical axioms. In essence, words mean what we want them to mean and, even if someone asserts that a word has an unintuitive extension (for example, claiming that the name ""dog"" only applies to the breeds Labrador, Terrier, and Poodle, at the exclusion of others), the individual who makes that assertion cannot be said be have committed a logical fallacy. It can merely be said that they have associated a name with a meaning in a way that is not shared by the speech community that the individual exists within. Whether there is consensus within a speech community as to the meaning (and thus extension) of a name is not a question for logic. And this is why it's not a true logical fallacy.

It is not a ""casual philosophical theory"" and, frankly, very little of what can be accurately described as philosophy (by people with some knowledge of philosophy) can be described as ""casual"". 

Describing what you deem epistemically sound arguments as ""laws of physics"", and epistemically unsound arguments as ""casual philosophical arguments"" is not indicative of someone with an particularly intellectual disposition.

Now if you wanted to reflect on why you think the argument: Voters in Scotland, as a whole, voted like this, but voters in Scotland who were born in Scotland voted differently, is particularly insightful or interesting, I don't think that would be a bad idea.

To me, it says something about Scottish nationalism insofar as it entails that Scottish nationalism is somehow wrapped up in some perceived sense of national identity that is contingent upon a person being born within the geographical boundaries of Scotland, or at least a sense of national identity of which the condition of being born of Scotland is a useful indicator.

Imo, in this, we find the contradictions of 21st century European nationalism in that Scottish nationalism is premised on progressive ideology which generally condemns exclusionary national identities, but yet it must simultaneously assert an exclusionary identity, lest it become self-defeating. The Scottish national identity cannot be exclusionary of foreigners, as this would make it guilty of the very crime of which it accuses England and thus derives legitimacy, but neither can it be entirely inclusive as then it would undermine itself in losing its grounds for arguing the there is sufficient difference between English born individuals present in Scotland and individuals born and raised in Scotland to warrant independence.

1802,"&gt;That's funny because that claim is even backed by one of the most respected historians in the world right now, Niall Ferguson, who is...... wait for it..... British...... hahahaha. QI also pointed out ""british selective memory"" about their wars with France (and to be honest even if they did not mention the Spaniards... from my experience, you have a selective memory of your rivalry with Spain as well). Here take a look. 

Niall Ferguson also supported the Iraq war, said the British empire wasn't that bad and France is a lost cause that is going to fall to Islam. He goes back to 387 BC to create his list, before France was even a country. I am going from more recent history. 

Though I agree that selective memory is a thing but it's also a thing with everyone. People like to remember victories more than defeats.

&gt;The British tend to be rather selective about the battles they remember. Every English schoolboy was once able to recite the roll call of our glorious wins at Crécy (1346), Poitiers (1356) and Agincourt (1415), but no one's ever heard of the French victories at Patay (1429) and (especially) at Castillon (1453), where French cannons tore the English apart, winning the Hundred Years War and confirming France as the most powerful military nation in Europe.

1855,"Finland, successor of Byzantines? Eh... I mean, yeah... Hellenic language and culture has certainly influenced Finnish language and Finnish culture to an extent and we also have some Eastern Orthodox churches... Calling Finland successor to the Byzantines is... Just... I don't know... Can it be called that?

Finland definitely IS influenced by Byzantines but successors... I don't know about that... Because our eastern neighbor was much more closer of Byzantines, historically, culturally and religiously. Another problem is that Finland is also influenced by Rome to an extent too.

Best way to put it is. Finland is that neighbor in a distance that has read books of both, Roman and Byzantine, shares some customs from both while retaining that aura of being unique but easy to interact with and relatable by both. Weird, I know.

Finland still is mainly Evangelic Lutheran but majority of the time Finnish people are quite apathetic towards religion.

Now to the topic of this thread. I personally have a beef with government of Greece and it only. Stop spending money willey nilley there. Because more money might not come. Turkey, I like Ebrú, water marbling paintings. That is a very neat painting style. And Hagia Sophia looks quite much more impressive with those towers.

I really don't like Erdogan personally, for one, no more empires please \*shoots a cold stare at USA quickly\* Turkey doesn't need an empire. It needs a leader who can put things back on the track you. Nation doesn't need to become an empire to fix it's own problems. Converting Hagia Sophia back in to a mosque?

I mean, it used to be a church/mosque... So what harm is there using it again as a church/mosque? Problem is, it also used to be a museum site and because of that it is going to get a lot more attention what comes on maintenance of the place. You know, keep it pretty, fix things if broken and don't be apathetic towards people trashing the place.

I quite honestly laughed when I heard Erdogan was going to use Hagia Sophia as a mosque again because while ally to Russia, Russia considers itself as a successor to the Byzantine roman and has good relations with the Balkan nations. Them not making a move or releasing a statement about this would make Russia look REALLY bad for the Balkan nations.

Basically in terms of politics, I laughed at it. Do I like what Erdogan is doing? Not really but I am mostly just laughing at Russia for developing such an interesting contradictory spaghetti they have to get out of somehow. Is Hagia Sophia an important building for me? Historically, yes. Religiously? Well, I am mostly apathetic towards religion so... Yeah.

Romania and Albania is a bit odd and I can only speculate. Romania is being a bit of a cash sink for rest of Europe but I love the history of the nation. Especially interesting people like Vlad the Impaler was quite interesting king. Albania is probably disliked because of the whole Kosovo thing... I don't know.

Albanian language is honestly REALLY interesting, just like Finnish, it is completely unique in Europe but with the added fact that it doesn't have language family member. How this came to be, I have to consider researching.

True.

But on the equipment side of things, I think the Turks have more submarines, frigates etc than the French.

Turkey has 16 Frigates, 23 missile boats and 13 subs. They've got 28 landing craft. Plus the newly acquired S400 missile defence system

France has 1 Nuclear aircraft carrier, 3 amphibious assault ships, 3 air-defence destroyers, 8 anti-submarine destroyers, 5 general-purpose frigates, and 6 surveillance frigates. The submarine force consists of 5 nuclear attack submarines and 4 nuclear ballistic missile submarines

The mistake people are making is just *assuming* that because the EU is European they're automatically superior in equipment, airpower, logistics etc to the Turks.

That's not the case. There is a *reason* Bush, Obama and Trump all asked the Europeans to not neglect their defence and to spend the 2% of GDP per annum. I think Germany spends 1.2% of GDP and most of that goes on pensions to their former cold war army personnel.

1937,"&gt; On one hand you have a country who tried to get back its land and indipendence

That would be Russia I assume? Because Poland *hadn't existed* since 1795 as an independent state and didn't have any land to get back, while all those independent states Soviet Russia invaded had been a part of Russia about one year prior. 

&gt;  invading every single western neighbour and want to go to berlin for ""world revolution

That came a bit later, but more crucially is mirrored in the Polish plans to establish [Międzymorze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermarium) and Piłsudski's [plan to break up Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prometheism), which of course came closest to fruition in the Soviet Union. 

&gt; And russia didn't only invade neighbours they invaded Poland , killed polish people

They invaded Poland only after Poland had invaded far into Soviet Russian controlled lands. The push towards Warsaw only happened as an *actual* counter-offensive after the Polish initial expansion eastwards was stopped, and fairly late in the war, too. 

&gt; Poland and Ukraine even fought the russian imperialism together

Not when Poland was busy invading Ukraine, which was itself embroiled in a civil war at the time.

&gt; ~~Russian~~ *Polish* ~~west~~ *east* ward offensive was just that an offensive to gain as much lands as they could in the ~~west~~ east.

2083,"&gt;− Head of the armed forces : like any head of state

Wait, who's head of state in Germany according to you ?

IIRC Merkel is head of the army and does answer to the Parliament since the Parliament can remove her for example.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;− can declare war : dubious. Besides, no country has declared war on another since 1982, and France since 1939.

Who can send troops though ? Isn't it exactly why France is much reactive thann its european counterparts ? See how long it takes to italians or swedish to send troop backing up french for Takuba special forces related to Barkhane.

2194,"I’m not bitter, I’m bemused.  Britain is bailing on a mutually beneficial relationship with its closest physical and historical neighbours.  And not just bailing, but bailing all the way, beyond a customs union, beyond efta, beyond the eea, not because the public particularly want that, but because some chancers who did seized control of the Tories.  It’s clearly become an unreliable partner for other countries that it might want closer ties with, since not only can it not be trusted to act in *your interest* (fair enough), you can’t even trust Britain to act in Britain’s interest.

And then the immediate plan is proposing that Canada, NZ and Australia join them in a new thing, where Britain will be by far far the largest economy and able to dominate the relationship.  This ignores a few things that I think are relevant:

- even with zero barriers, technical and tarrif, there’s not a lot more trade possible between the countries, they already do lots and have fairly low barriers, so there’s no huge incentive for anyone to bother, financially
- the EU is still a much bigger market for NZ, Canada and Australia, so any deal with the U.K. has to be compatible with each of their deals with the EU, meaning that technical standards seem likely to converge on the EU anyway
- Australia at least has little appetite for more immigration, despite what Brits think - Australia has made the immigration situation for New Zealanders **worse** over the last two decades, and they’re no threat economically, huge trading partners, next door, and by far the best friends in the world
- I don’t think there’s much appetite in Britain for it either, since if you wanted more Australians or Kiwis, you could have let them in and you didn’t at any point in the past 70 years
- the Australian government already rejected FoM with Britain a few months ago
- Australia at least likes to think of itself as “punching above its weight”, so there’d be strong opposition to rolling over on anything for a bigger country, and given that:
- the entire vibe of it from the Brits I see discuss it has this sort of inevitability about it, as if just because Britain wants it, the others will agree to it.  They’re separate countries now, and have their own goals, and helping Britain in any way that might harm them just to try to assist Britain react to sabotaging its own economy is just not going to happen

&gt; the label ""sterile"" in the above calculation includes also heterosexual married couple who choose to not have kids, pedophiles, involuntary sterile, etc

And yet, your first label for this is ""LGBT, etc"". This is a bias in itself. 

&gt; Already happened. Next year (2021), Europe population will peak. The denial that shrinkage does not happen will only fuel existential worry / xenophobic sentiment in this continent.

Nobody denies that shrinkage is happening. I'm denying the fact that you're trying to attribute it in a significant way to the LGBT ideology.

&gt;Debating attribution for population shrinkage is not fruitful.

Debating it is fruitful, since you're proposing your view on this, you can't hide behind the fact that arguments will come out to counter-act this. 

&gt;LGBT normalization IS against the historical norm. 

So was crucifixion, till it was banned; amongst a plethora of other ""norms"". Times are a'changing. Norm does not mean ""right"". 

&gt; What (should be) a static percentage would shift higher due to normalization.

Yes, also the number of people crucifixed collapsed sensibly. This does not help your argument. 

&gt; Example: teenagers in Instagram now proudly claim they're bipolar even when they're not.

Counter argument: teenagers always pass a 'rebellious' phase, in which they try and get on with the times and find a way to 'differentiate' themselves. This has more to say about the fact that being bipolar is a cry of attention, rather to the fact that being bipolar was/is being 'normalized' to use your words. 

Normalize LGBT and this won't happen as it wont be 'rebellious' enough. 

&gt;LGBT normalization IS against the historical norm. 

You're not showing LGBT normalization though, you're showing what you think is the main cause of shrinkage of population, which has no correlation to this fact - regardless of normalization; LGBT humans were always present. 

It seems that you're hinting at the fact that their mental health, in your mind, would be secondary to their exploitation for making childrens.  

In the end you're giving your (biased) opinion on why some random people were giving a certain answer to a poll, that is currently unsourced and we don't know the actual questions that were given, who conducted it, on what percentage of population and if certain biases were used. 

Bring on some real data, not some back of the end math with biased labels to support your theory.

And again; ""threat"" does not mean that. 
You're basically trying to say that the free will of the LGBT community over wether or not to have childrens is a threat to the country. And to do so, you're pushing an agenda over which only their free will is taken into this matter, but not the free will of any person that isn't LGBT but doesn't want to have children regardless of his sexuality.",European Union,/r/europe/comments/i7ntv6/prolgbt_protest_in_poznan_poland/g1bm221/,TheItalianDonkey,1597322733

2330,"All modern fighters are multi-role fighters, there no longer are ""interceptors"", and listening to Ahti Lappi on this matter is like listening to a wolf about the sheep herd. He is a lifelong anti-air man, and is, understandably, miffed about the fact that the country doesn't currently have long-range Ground-to-Air AA-missiles and that the old BUK's were decommissioned. However, he is absolutely wrong about the fact that missiles could do the job of the fighters.  


First we have to look at the mobility. A surface-to-air missile battery (SAM) is slow, and can't move around to answer enemy threats, whereas a fighter, by its nature, can very quickly reroute to answer surprising developments. The fighter also has better sensors and the new fighter, no matter what is picked, is going to be able to ""talk"" to the AA units, and other planes in a way that the SAM batteries just can't. Its missiles also have a similar range to long-range AA units and don't have to waster power to get off the ground.  


However, the fighters are not there just for AA, but for ground support and in future naval support too. Even if simply buying enough SAM's to fulfil the AA capabilities were possible (which it kinda isn't as the capabilities differ) we would also need to buy equipment to fill the gap in these areas. Currently, the weapons on the F-18's and the coming HX planes can be used to attack the enemy in their strategic depth in a way that simple artillery just can't: JASSM missiles have a range of almost 400 kilometres, much more than any artillery system the Land Forces are currently using. (Current maximum range seems to be around 70 km for the MLRS).   


What this means is that the airforce can be used to strike at targets that we otherwise could do nothing about: enemy HQs, and important infrastructure, loss of which will hurt the whole war effort. For example the roads towards Nuijamaa and Vaalimaa on the Russian side of the border bottleneck at three bridges, two road- and one railway bridge, near Viipuri. Were these bridges taken out it would disrupt Russian logistics on the whole Kaakonkulma front. Four further bridges at Antrea and Losevo are the lifeline of the rest of the Karjalan Kannas. Without them, all supplies have to be brought through the Laatokka-Ääninen Kannas until the bridges are repaired. This will slow down the enemy advance considerably and buys the FDF more time to mobilize and organize troops and defences.  


Simply put no other weapons system can offer that kind of strategic capability to the FDF. The JASSM can even threaten St. Petersburg should there for some reason be a need for that.

And then we have the naval part, which is a requirement in the new fighters. Basically they should be getting Anti-Ship missiles used to bolster the capabilities of the navy and the coastal troops.   


Thus, to replace the fighters with something else would mean buying at least 3 separate missile systems in large numbers, which would lack the mobility and ability to react of the fighters, and which would still not offer all the capabilities that the fighters provide.",,/r/europe/comments/i88pdh/military_expenditure_in_europe/g1bmfb6/,AnarchoPlatypi,1597322969

2338,"There are two things here.

First, there is some benefit because you can actually get stuff you want in a restaurant, unlike in some German restaurants where you the waiter has disappeared and you have no chance to get another drink or fix something wrong with the meal, etc. - or even to pay and leave! However, I tend to prefer the European approach after living here for so long. When I go home, I get kind of annoyed that they ask me how my meal is before I even had a bite.

The other thing is that it's a really big misunderstanding from Europeans that fake friendliness is completely fake. People are actually more outwardly friendly in Canada / US vs. Germany, for example. Even if the ""hi, how are you? May I take your order?"" is a canned line, servers actually often will strike up a conversation with you and might even be genuinely interested in talking with you. They aren't robots or servants. My mom was a waitress for a long time in Canada and she made many friends or just had interesting conversations, etc.

In Germany, servers feel very cold and it seems very clear they legitimately have zero interest in knowing anything about you. It feels bad. No one should force them, of course, but I feel kind of sad that many people (not just servers) just don't want anything to do with you and many cashiers even are outright unhappy or angry. The Tegut near me, for example, only seems to hire the most unhappy people - maybe they are beating them... I don't know.

I literally love calling home to Canada to some support line (like for a bank or maybe a government-related thing), just so I can talk to some overly friendly Canadian person. And the sense of warmth I feel when I board an Air Canada flight (still in Frankfurt airport) is tangible.

tl;dr: It's not all fake and some European countries feel very unfriendly if you come from an open country.",Canadian / German,/r/europe/comments/i8jqwm/amazons_ruthless_business_model_meets_swedens/g1bmlb7/,matttk,1597323076

But, as i stated : Is it relevant for a country with very limited sea exposure, to invest in a navy greater than basic coastal defences.

Italy, Spain and France already have knowledges on that topic. Italy can bring a lot about local sea control, when France can bring about global projection and logistics.  


Germany should not have the burden of making a navy she will, in the end, not use. France needs to stay Global and to protect its islands. Italy needs to protect its (way too long) coast, and spain have to do the same (along with controling the entrance to the Med.

I suspect a good deal of Moldovans would end up voting for the social-democrats here unfortunately, while those from the urban areas would vote for the liberals. There is a party of a former president here that I suspect would become quite popular there since it’s the one pushing the unification idea the most (for the Moldovan unionists at least, obviously).

2436,"&gt;You do realise that all treasury money is raised by the entire UK as a whole which includes Scotland.

Yes.

&gt;Its not Wales, England and N Ireland deciding to pool together to hand money to Scotland.

It's the UK government deciding to hand money to Scotland. Scottish funding is partly local, but the majority is based on a multiple per capita of England's spending. ie, if England gets 1 spending per person on a devolved issue (eg health or education), Scotland gets (roughly) 1.15

It's more complex than that, because Scotland now receives some of its tax revenue directly, rather than paying it to Westminster, but that's the basic principle. Funding for devolved areas is based on a multiple of funding in England.

&gt;The fiscal transfer is part of Scotlands tax money being handed back to it.

The fiscal transfer is the extra money Scotland gets, over and above the taxes and fees it contributes plus a per capita share of UK borrowing.

For example, according to the Scottish government in 2018/19 Scotland contributed £62.7 billion in revenue and received £75.3 billion in spending. The ""net fiscal balance"" was -£12.6 billion, the fiscal transfer was £10.5 billion (because Scotland's population share of UK borrowing was £2.1 billion, so Scotland received an extra £10.5 billion).

To put it in per capita terms, people in Scotland receive £1,661 extra in public spending and pay £307 less in tax.",,/r/europe/comments/i8bh5f/majority_of_scots_support_independence_from_uk/g1bd198/,WhiteSatanicMills,1597315911

Lukashenka and Putin/Russia has certainly been at odds even as they are great allies. Russia wants to have more control over Belarus, but Lukashenko wants to be a proper dictator and does not want to submit to Russia. The protests that are happening in Belarus now happen to also be in the interest of Russia, as they weaken Lukashenko's hold, as long the protests do not escalate and lead to full democratic Belarus (at which point Russia would likely certainly do the same thing as they did in Ukraine and bring their army to Belarus to quash independent democratic movement). Anyway, so about Tikhanovskaya, it is likely not true that she is Putin's puppet because after all she went to seek asylum to Lithuania and not Russia.

2487,"The argument, and evidence, goes at follows: 

European economic integration, by being relatively successful in allowing and enhancing capital movility, has accelerated continental divergences in terms of economic complexity (industrial capabilities basically) mimicking what its happening inter-capitalist wise within national economies (super-firm theory et al). This affects labour structures, the weight of financialisation (from southern bubble-driven accummulation to the NL becoming a continental Ireland) and external balances (economic complexity is the foundation of  exports vis a vis Asia).

This process, as with the urban-rural economic divide nationally, shows and will show a strong spatial bias. Mediterranean non-coordinated political economies have rapidly lost industrial critical mass because they are organically ill-suited to deploy the scale and inter-capital &amp; public-private mechanisms required to stay at the technological forefront. They were forced by the Commission to go full German export model on 2011 and they failed as expected only achieving poor results through labour devaluation. For them, as for any region left behind, without even their own monetary policy to fuel some dynamism, they are trapped in a perpetual self-reinforcing depression (Google “Maastricht and all that” by Godley prediction in 1992). 

While the periphery has yet not found alternative accummulation models to keep up, DE, AT and CZ have naturally and gradually articulated a massive inter-connected industrial complex which now dominates European industrial competitiveness. This has extended through logistics and labour arbitration to PL, HU &amp; RO somewhat (their current “economic boom”). 

While this eastern european bloc is likely to keep developing and harvesting the distributional fruits of scale &amp; economic complexity, Bulgaria &amp; the Baltics have not truly catched up, they don’t dont really posess the political economies to drive industrial compatibility + they are spatially further. In this regard, they are showing the same trajectory as the Mediterranean 1990-2010, initial booms not supported by organic industrial development.

Your post clearly paints these Polish soldiers as defenders of the continent, when they were in truth acting on behalf of a government that did not have some continental interests at heart, but was blatantly interested in Machiavellian power politics. This is evidenced by the fact that Poland not only attacked Soviet Russia, but also Ukraine and Lithuania, who should have been on their side if, as you claim, Poland was simply a part of the Russian Civil War.

I don't have an issue with valuing the defenders of Warsaw in 1920 and honoring their enormous willingness of self-sacrifice, but let's not pretend they were the victims of aggression. They were the perpetrators.

&gt; Critics said that voters who favor a developed version of the current status of Puerto Rico (a commonwealth which is part of the United States with internal self-government) had no alternatives on the ballot. As a result, leaders of the Popular Democratic Party (PPD) instructed such voters to leave the second portion of the ballot blank, or to invalidate the ballot.[27]

&gt; Because there were almost 500,000 blank ballots, creating confusion as to the voters' true desire, it provided Congress an opportunity to ignore the vote, which it did.[28]

&gt; History professor Luis Agrait explained the result in this manner to CNN: ""If you assume those blank votes are anti-statehood votes, the true result for the statehood option would be less than 50%.""[29] Considered as a percentage of the total number of votes cast in the first ballot, 44% voted in favor of statehood on the second ballot.

2601,"&gt;It's not about comfort it's about your fucking health.

No, it *effectively* is about comfort, and practicity. 

And as a matter of fact, the widespread use of AC is actually kinda detrimental from a prophylactic perspective.

To an extent, we're literally engineered, as a species, to sustain that kind of heat: the occasional AC doesn't hurt, but relying too heavily on it messes with the adaptative [thermoregulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoregulation_in_humans) mechanisms of the human body. 

It effectively denies the body the opportunity to [acclimatise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acclimatization), and as such, it alters the efficiency of thermoregulation and lowers our physiological tolerance to heat. Which in turn, quite logically, hightens the risk of heatstroke and dehydration when we're confronted to extreme temperatures.

&amp;nbsp;

The **actual** health hazard posed by heat in Europe --*what occasionally kills*-- is societal in nature: inadequate personal behaviours, not caring for the elderly, inadequate building designs and urban planning, etc.

But mostly, it's down to **inadequate personal behaviours**: just like you don't sunbathe wet and naked by -20°C, you don't behave during a heatwave the same way you do the rest of the time. 

While it may sound obvious, a lot of people just don't know how to react to a heatwave, not because they're stupid, but because they're not used to it.

Countering the ill-effects of heat is actually easy and straightforward -- especially in Europe, where air humidity isn't affecting perspiration as much as it does in tropical areas:

- **drink plenty of water, regularly, even if you're not thirsty** ;
- keep your body cooled with small wet towels around your neck and/or head ;
- slow down and don't overexercise physically ;
- ideally, pair the above with fans for extra comfort ;
- check on the elderly: as old age reduces the sensation of dehydration, they're the most exposed population.

Really, it's that simple.

**Assuming the appropriate behaviour**, that I partly laid out above, that kind of heatwave is uncomfortable and oppressive, but certainly not a health hazard.

Thus, yes, modern home AC **is** about comfort: it sidesteps acclimatisation and spares you the trouble of adapting your behaviours to the situation. By definition, it **is** a convenience.

&amp;nbsp;

Now, I'm not advocating getting rid of AC, it's obviously practical and comfortable to rely on AC to cool down, especially at work. But claiming that owning an AC is a matter of *health* is just flat out wrong and misguiding.

**Again:** with the caveat that the fundamental steps that I listed above are undertaken, to overcome heat and dehydration.

FYI, I live in Paris, in a small flat that builds up heat like crazy (and I mean: *crazy*), and while I hated every minute of it and eagerly waits for the heatwave to be over, the last week of near-constant +35°C was categorically and inherently manageable without AC.",France,/r/europe/comments/i8fahv/western_europe_current_heatwave_is_hitting_hard/g1axqjp/,Orravan_O,1597301162

2606,"&gt;The Battle of Warsaw, also known as the Miracle of the Vistula, was a series of battles that resulted in a decisive Polish victory in 1920 during the Polish–Soviet War. Poland, on the verge of total defeat, repulsed and defeated the Red Army in what Vladimir Lenin, the Bolshevik leader, called ""an enormous defeat"" for his forces.[3]


&gt;After the Polish Kiev Offensive, Soviet forces launched a successful counterattack in summer 1920, forcing the Polish army to retreat westward in disarray. The Polish forces seemed on the verge of disintegration and observers predicted a decisive Soviet victory.


&gt;The battle of Warsaw was fought from August 12–25, 1920 as Red Army forces commanded by Mikhail Tukhachevsky approached the Polish capital of Warsaw and the nearby Modlin Fortress. On August 16, Polish forces commanded by Józef Piłsudski counterattacked from the south, disrupting the enemy's offensive, forcing the Russian forces into a disorganized withdrawal eastward and behind the Neman River. Estimated Russian losses were 10,000 killed, 500 missing, 30,000 wounded, and 66,000 taken prisoner, compared with Polish losses of some 4,500 killed, 10,000 missing, and 22,000 wounded.


&gt;In the following months, several more Polish follow-up victories secured Poland's independence and led to a peace treaty with Soviet Russia and Soviet Ukraine later that year, securing the Polish state's eastern frontiers until 1939.

&gt;The politician and diplomat Edgar Vincent regards this event as one of the most important battles in history on his expanded list of most decisive battles, since the Polish victory over the Soviets halted the spread of communism further westwards into Europe. A Soviet victory, which would have led to the creation of a pro-Soviet Communist Poland, would have put the Soviets directly on the eastern border of Germany, where considerable revolutionary ferment was present at the time.

My cousins grew up in the old farmhouse of their grandparents, while the grandparents lived in a smaller newer house on the same land. They (my cousins) both moved out after high school, but now one of them moved back into the old farm house when her parents decided to move out. 

I'm not at all disagreeing with you, there is definitely a big difference in culture on this. Just trying to show that it's not black and white either, it's not like everyone in Scandinavia completely cuts their ties with their families when they grow up. 

Unless your family is rich and pays for it there's no way you could afford to get your own house in your early twenties here, even if it was an expansion of your parents house or whatever (which would be legally difficult, building permits and stuff). So if you're living with your parents you're doing it the same way you did as a kid, you have your room or whatever and that's it. At best you might live in a former guest house or whatever and get a bit of privacy.

2665,"BRUSSELS — It started as a Saturday trip to Belgium’s coast, a chance to escape a heat wave and coronavirus restrictions for a while. As the tide came in, the beach got crowded. Someone complained about the music being too loud. The mood quickly turned ugly.

Within minutes, dozens of people were battling it out on the sands. Some beach-goers threw bottles and umbrellas at police officers who intervened.

By Sunday, a “gang of outsiders” was being blamed, and two coastal communities had banned day trippers from the city. Officers stood ready at railway stations and blocked traffic, turning away people who can’t afford to live, work, or pay for hotel reservations in the area. Three teens, shirtless, still in their swimming gear, were charged with “armed rebellion.”

On Tuesday, Belgium’s interior minister was trying to explain how it all happened, summoned to a tetchy hearing by the main populist party and a far-right nationalist faction. Civic groups called for action, urging people from poorer neighborhoods — among the hardest-hit by the virus — to find lawyers if they felt harassed by police “racial profiling,” or by zealous officials protecting wealthy holiday-makers at well-to-do beach communities.

Welcome to Belgium; a country that still has no full-time government 18 months after the last cabinet resigned; a country with one of the highest COVID-19 mortality rates in the world per population where restrictions are testing peoples’ patience; a country that just doesn’t get much really hot weather. It’s a simmering political soup on the verge of boiling over.

At the seaside resort of Knokke-Heist, where golf carts with license plates ply well-kept streets, there was ample room to stretch out on the beach early this week. Local authorities have banished day-trippers, who include many minorities, from Belgian cities or France from its 15-kilometer (10-mile) stretch of sands until the heat wave — which saw temperatures of up to 36 degrees Celsius (97 Fahrenheit) — is over.

Down a tree-lined street, at a home that he says dates from Napoleonic times, the mayor — Count Leopold Lippens — told The Associated Press that Knokke-Heist is an exclusive area prized for its many shops, restaurants and art galleries, and that only law-abiding people should bother to come.

“We are here in a country called Belgium, where the law is the law,” Lippens said. “We want the rules to be followed and if the rules are not followed, well, we will use our police force to have them followed.”

“People who don’t do that, they will be eradicated from this place,” he said.

Asked whether he worried that banning ordinary people from spending the day might tarnish the image of his town, the mayor said: “People come because they like it, and they like it because it’s quality. We don’t want quantity, we want quality.”

That view grates with Thierry Dupiereux, information officer with Belgium’s League of Families, a social organization aimed at helping families in need, and which lobbies for policy change. He says that the beach bans deprive people of “a safety-valve that helps them unwind.”

Almost 10,000 people have died from the coronavirus in Belgium — a country of just 11.5 million — and Dupiereux said the travel restrictions are “a social injustice” aimed at a part of society that has been hardest hit by the disease and the job losses that followed; people “who have little money, who can’t afford a week’s vacation at the beach or holidays abroad.”

The coast is just a 90-minute train ride from the capital Brussels. Other places where people without cars could get away and cool off are poorly served by public transport. Many youths boarded trains in Brussels on Tuesday, but the Knokke-Heist station was almost empty.

At first, the national rail service SNCB resisted calls to cut the number of beach-bound trains, but caved in as political pressure mounted and will now provide fewer this coming weekend. A number of lawmakers urged Interior Minister Pieter De Crem to rein in the SNCB, notably Bjorn Answeeuw, from the populist N-VA party.

Belgium’s last government collapsed when the N-VA pulled out. The party is too big to ignore and has been central in talks to form a new administration over the 14 months since the last election. During that time, the N-VA has routinely criticized the interim government installed to manage the COVID-19 crisis. Fears over migration have proved a vote winner for the party.

“Going freely to the coast is a right that we all have. Being beach day-trippers does not make us terrorists for a day,” De Crem said. For people like those involved in Saturday’s beach riot in Blankenberge, De Crem suggested setting up a register — similar to ones used for soccer hooligans — and banning those on it from going to the coast.

Other parliamentarians expressed concern about the way police have acknowledged stopping people who merely look like the youths involved in the riot. “It wasn’t a night club bouncer who said this, it was a police officer,” said Socialist lawmaker Herve Rigot.

At the League of Families, Thierry Dupiereux said it’s difficult to work out who to believe these days, when the coronavirus, the lack of a full-time government and even a heat wave weigh on everyone’s minds and make for strange times.

“We’re in a political situation in Belgium today where a lot is at stake. We don’t always know who is acting on behalf of whom. There are lots of political games being played,” he said.

In a surprising about-face a few hours after speaking to AP, and after the parliamentary hearing — which might underline the pressures involved — Mayor Lippens announced that day-trippers could return to Knokke-Heist as of Wednesday.",Tschörmanie,/r/europe/comments/i8qzfu/belgian_beach_brawl_fuels_virus_political_climate/g1aypr4/,u_ve_been_troIIed,1597302017

Sorry, but you are blatantly wrong. 

There is plentiful amount of data available from which we can draw to make a conclusion that the average Belarusian/Eastern European refugee is safer and more capable of integrating in Western Europe than the average Arab from Near-East or African. 

https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/world/2017/october/study-most-violent-rapes-in-sweden-committed-by-men-of-foreign-origin

""The study by Joakim Jonasson, based on more than 4,000 convictions between 2012 and 2017, found the groups most represented in violent rape cases were Somalis, Eritreans, Algerians, Iraqis, and Gambians.""

""*Jonasson also found that 90 percent of gang rapes were committed by men with non-European ancestry*, and that those foreign-born men sexually harass native Swedes much more than they harass foreign-born women also living in Sweden.""

Note how these Muslim/Arab/African rapists harass native Swedish women, instead of other immigrant women. This is partially motivated by their hatred towards Christians and native Europeans. 

Let's not forget about the Pakistani grooming gangs in Britain, who targeted native British girls.

Here's a recent grooming case from Finland:

""Khaled Kelkal, France’s first homegrown terrorist, and the Kouachi brothers (Charlie Hebdo, Paris, 2015) share a number of common features: second generation; fairly well integrated at first; period of petty crime; radicalisation in prison; attack and death – weapons in hand – in a standoff with the police""

""Another characteristic that all western countries have in common is that radicals are almost all “born-again” Muslims who, after living a highly secular life – frequenting clubs, drinking alcohol, involvement in petty crime – suddenly renew their religious observance, either individually or in the context of a small group. The Abdeslam brothers ran a Brussels bar and went out to nightclubs in the months preceding the Bataclan shooting. Most move into action in the months following their religious “reconversion” or “conversion”, but have usually already exhibited signs of radicalisation""",,/r/europe/comments/i8e92h/lithuania_allows_belarusians_to_enter_for/g1ayu4v/,zarthos,1597302126

2722,"&gt;It's not about comfort it's about your fucking health.

No, it *effectively* is about comfort, and practicity. 

And as a matter of fact, the widespread use of AC is actually detrimental from a prophylactic perspective.

To an extent, we're literally engineered, as a species, to sustain that kind of heat: the occasional AC doesn't hurt, but relying too heavily on it messes with the adaptative [thermoregulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoregulation_in_humans) mechanisms of the human body. 

It effectively denies the body the opportunity to [acclimatise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acclimatization), and as such, it alters the efficiency of thermoregulation and lowers our physiological tolerance to heat. Which in turn, quite logically, hightens the risk of heatstroke and dehydration when we're confronted to extreme temperatures.

&amp;nbsp;

The **actual** health hazard posed by heat in Europe --*what occasionally kills*-- is societal in nature: inadequate personal behaviours, not caring for the elderly, inadequate building designs and urban planning, etc.

But mostly, it's down to **inadequate personal behaviours**: just like you don't sunbathe wet and naked by -20°C, you don't behave during a heatwave the same way you do the rest of the time. 

While it may sound obvious, a lot of people just don't know how to react to a heatwave, not because they're stupid, but because they're not used to it.

Countering the ill-effects of heat is actually easy and straightforward -- especially in Europe, where air humidity isn't affecting perspiration as much as it does in tropical areas:

- **drink plenty of water, regularly, even if you're not thirsty** ;
- keep your body cooled with small wet towels around your neck and/or head ;
- slow down and don't overexercise physically ;
- ideally, pair the above with fans for extra comfort ;
- check on the elderly: as old age reduces the sensation of dehydration, they're the most exposed population.

Really, it's that simple.

**Assuming the appropriate behaviour**, that I partly laid out above, that kind of heatwave is uncomfortable and oppressive, but certainly not a health hazard.

Thus, yes, modern home AC **is** about comfort: it sidesteps acclimatisation and spares you the trouble of adapting your behaviours to the situation. By definition, it **is** a convenience.

&amp;nbsp;

Now, I'm not advocating getting rid of AC, it's obviously practical and comfortable to rely on AC to cool down, especially at work. But claiming that owning an AC is a matter of *health* is just flat out wrong and misguiding.

**Again:** with the caveat that the fundamental steps that I listed above are undertaken, to overcome heat and dehydration.

FYI, I live in Paris, in a small flat that builds up heat like crazy (and I mean: *crazy*), and while I hated every minute of it and eagerly waits for the heatwave to be over, the last week of near-constant +35°C was categorically, inherently manageable without AC.

2728,"&gt; I still consider this a very dodgy statement with a huge leeway for further actions. 

It quite clearly condemns the election result as fraudulent and accuses the state of oppressing its people.

&gt; Unless it is clearly stated otherwise, Lukashenko is recognized as an elected official and will be the contact person for the highest level of interactions.

There is no rebel force to treat as the government of Belarus. The opposition leader has fled the country to the EU (Lithuania specifically, which has lifted travel restrictions for humanitarian purposes). The only result of this would be the end of all diplomatic relations.

&gt; Which is who exactly? 

This is yet to be discussed - the meeting is on Friday.

&gt; You implicitly understand, that it's the ""President"" however that is not the case. What is meant here are some captains of OMON who are beating people on the streets.

No, I don't - for diplomatic reasons I highly doubt he will be banned from entering the EU. His captains, supporting businesses and the ruling political class surrounding him will likely be targeted, however. We should not be supporting the holidays and growing wealth of people who rig elections and oppress populations, we should freeze their assets and ban travel.

We've seen the EU sanction companies who build infrastructure key to the situation in Ukraine, for example. Other targets include ministers loyal to dictators, or associated businessmen profiting directly from the situation. The message is that if you assist in empowering the scum of the world we will not give you access to the many things which attract the world's wealthy here, even if we cannot end their rule abroad.

&gt;First, Hadhrat Ayesha was the daughter of Hadhrat Abu Bakr. Tabari reports, “All four of \[Abu Bakr’s\] children were born of his two wives…during the pre-Islamic period \[i.e., pre-610 AD\].” \[11\] Hadhrat Ayesha’s marriage to Prophet Muhammad took place one year after Hijra (emigration to Medina), or around 624 AD. Therefore, even if Hadhrat Ayesha had been born as late as 609 AD, only a year before Prophet Muhammad claimed prophethood, she would have been roughly fourteen at the time of emigration to Medina in 623 and therefore no less than fifteen at the time of her marriage to Prophet Muhammad. This is a far cry from the age of six that critics assert.Likewise, most historians report that Hadhrat Asma, Hadhrat Ayesha’s elder sister, was ten years her senior. \[12\] The books Tahzibut Tahzib and Al-Bidaayah wa an-Nihayah both report that Hadhrat Asma died at the age of one hundred, in 73 AH (695 AD). \[13\] This means that Hadhrat Asma must have been no younger than twenty-seven at the time of emigration. Hadhrat Ayesha’s marriage to Prophet Muhammad was in 1 AH or by some sources 2 AH, when Asma was twenty-eight.This means that at a minimum, Hadhrat Ayesha was eighteen or nineteen upon her consenting marriage to Prophet Muhammad.research showed that she was actually 15 at the time of her betrothal and 19 at the time of her marriage.Research subsequent to the time of Maulana Muhammad Ali has shown that she was older than this.An excellent short work presenting such evidence is the Urdu pamphlet Rukhsati kai Waqt Sayyida Aisha Siddiqa ki Umar (‘The age of Lady Aisha at the time of the start of her married life’) by Abu Tahir Irfani. Points 1 to 3 below has been brought to light in this pamphlet.The famous classical historian of Islam, Ibn Jarir Tabari, wrote in his ‘History’:“In the time before Islam, Abu Bakr married two women. The first was Fatila daughter of Abdul Uzza, from whom Abdullah and Asma were born. Then he married Umm Ruman, from whom Abdur Rahman and Aisha were born. These four were born before Islam.”Being born before Islam means being born before the Call.The compiler of the famous Hadith collection Mishkat al-Masabih, Imam Wali-ud-Din Muhammad ibn Abdullah Al-Khatib, who died 700 years ago, has also written brief biographical notes on the narrators of Hadith reports. He writes under Asma, the older daughter of Abu Bakr:“She was the sister of Aisha Siddiqa, wife of the Holy Prophet, and was ten years older than her. … In 73 A.H. … Asma died at the age of one hundred years""This would make Asma 28 years of age in 1 A.H., the year of the Hijra, thus making Aisha 18 years old in 1 A.H.So Aisha would be 19 years old at the time of the consummation of her marriage, and 14 or 15 years old at the time of her nikah. It would place her year of birth at four or five years before the Call.The same statement is made by the famous classical commentator of the Holy Quran, Ibn Kathir, in his book Al-bidayya wal-nihaya:“Asma died in 73 A.H. at the age of one hundred years.

Now the small country with 0.5 trillion economy it has a 10 % contraction  or 0.050 trillions = 0.45 trillion

Europe GDP 20 - 0.050 contraction= **19.950** trillion

Can you add directly those number  = no because the base number (the TOTAL gdp of each country) is diferent (much diferent)

In this example you can see that because the economy of Germany 10 times bigger than the small country ,the German contraction is 10 times bigger than the small country even if both countris has the same 10% contraction.

2870,"I'm not quite sure that hydrogen is the way to go. The problems are efficiency, cost and that you don't have a planned market. 

If you had a planned market, you could use the electricity to produce hydrogen for free, but this wont happen. You will always have to pay for electricity, all be it at a much lower price. 

The next problem is that the machines you need to convert electricity into hydrogen are very expensive, high-maintenance and not very efficient. This does drastically increase the price of hydrogen, even while electricity is super cheap. You best case efficiency is around 60% here, but that's not realistic. 

Next you have to store the hydrogen which is also not that cheap. If you use big pressure tanks you need A LOT of maintenance as they tend to leak, or if you use metal absorption you need a lot of capital investment into expensive tanks. 

Lastly you have to convert the hydrogen back to electricity. You could do that with big fuel cells which are extremely expensive, or you can convert a natural gas plant which is slightly less efficient but a lot better when it comes to maintenance cost per energy produced. Meaning this option has better cost efficiency. The Energy efficiency from hydrogen to Electricity is around 50% here. 

All in all, you loose 75% of the energy you put in and you also have massive capital investment as well as high maintenance costs. Even if you get the electricity for basically free, with you wont, your selling price would still have to be high to cover your other costs. 

When your costs is high, you just wont be able to compete with other providers that use some form of battery storage. Their capital cost is lower and their efficiency much higher. 

Battery storage takes a long time to deploy as they rely on cheap, used Battery packs from Cars and other sources but the mere existence of this option makes hydrogen uneconomic. 

That being said, there are developments for cheaper batteries and other storage technologies that can compete.

Wow, you found the YT comments about a FOOTBALL GAME cancerous? Welcome to the Internet, I suppose.

I have a better example if you really want to see what cancer actually looks like: I came across this vid on my YT. It's a Greek (or Greek Cypriot) military anthem literally talking about invading Turkey and genociding Turkish people. Take a good look at the comment section and then come again to tell me that the Turkish community on the Internet is the worst.

&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2CDm95QBXs

&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imB6dEjMbmI

Btw, the first video was posted on this sub and was removed because it was listed as ''unsourced''. This should give you a slight idea why the Turks embrace nationalism. A regular Turk going on about his day would be subjected to such an amazing amount of hate that of course he would be radicalized. We don't have military anthems like this in Turkey, nor do we inject such amount of hate against other nations to our people. You guys love going around saying ''you are brainwashed nationalists'' but I beg to differ. European nationalism has an important role in nourishing Turkish nationalism.

&gt;I think your bias is making you underestimate the impact of the online Turkish community.

Not really, my personal experience with the online Turkish community is far worse than what you seem to be complaining about. It's not a delusional Balkan nationalism type of thing but the rise of the Islamist, Anti-Republic Arabized Turks who hate Ataturk and praise Erdogan and are in a serious preparation of a counter-revolution similar to the Islamic revolution in Iran.

Lviv has it's own special flavor of modernism/art-deco/functionalism with streamline elements here and there. Small villas in former suburban areas and whole districts were built in that unique style.

Unfortunately, it's significance and uniqueness is rarely recognized, thus you can see not just dilapidated buildings here and there, but something way worse: locals who rebuild these little stylish marvels into tacky dwellings of their own distorted convenience and taste.

When I walked these streets I  saw a lot of beauty and style, but also it felt poignant. Most of it is being encroached upon by tackiness, greed and overall lack of taste. They are being rebuilt, repurposed and ruined.

Overwhelming majority of people are just ignorant of it. They don't see the beauty of the city and thus they don't cherish it.

2955,"Black and white are the prussian colors, red and white the colors of the hanseatic league. Politically, the German Empire was led by the Prussians, while economically (atleast when it came to trade) the former hanseatic cities had lots of power (since they also funded the entire trade fleet). That's where the black-white-red flag comes from. And this would also NOT reflect ""German"" roots, but more specifically North-German roots. Saxonians, Suabians, Franconians and Bavarians would definetly not appreciate that flag and could never identify with it in a national sentiment (those are the German subculture that still have a very strong self-identity).

To understand why the democratic Germany uses Black-Red-Gold instead, you have to go back to the roots of German nationalism at the beginning of the 19th century. Black-Red-Gold were the colors that were worn by anti-napoleonic militia fighting against napoleonic control over Germany. That is also the reason why in the March Revolution of 1848, which practically birthed a first national-german sentiment in all the German speaking lands (including German-Austria), flew the colors Black-Red-Gold and that is also why later the democratic German Republic (1918/9-1933) flew those colors, and now the Federal Republic of Germany is flying those colors. That's why those colors also better reflect a National-German sentiment as in ""One German country instead of 1000"" (even though we still have 2 fully German countries nowadays, but that has a different reason).",Franconia (Germany),/r/europe/comments/i8ifhk/i_can_only_wonder_how_they_managed_to_use_this/g1a2f9u/,DarkImpacT213,1597280914

It set back the fight against ISIS.

I'm not sure if I even need sources, because it was only months ago. If your argument is that it isn't true because some Kurds are still there, after the news of fighters being killed, villages and politicians being surrounded was on the front page here, it's truly grotesque.The Armenians still exist, that means the Ottomans didn't do anything, right?

So, I want to make sure. Are you or are you not denying that Kurds were killed by the Turkish, following Trump's phone call with Erdogan?

&gt;Russia

They shelled a group of Turkish soldiers whom Turkey's government pretended were not there. It's a fraying alliance of interests, the US is out, now it's just Turkey and Russia competing.


&gt;French soldiers in MENA

We never had soldiers apart from a few commandos there, same as the British. Commandos whose missions reportedly had to be cancelled because eof the speed of the retreat.

The army is in the Sahel.

&gt;Pastor

Yes, and the Turkish still haven't backtracked on their economic retaliations for that. Very effective, but Michael Flynn of Trump's adminstration also negotiated with Turkey to kidnap Fethullah Gülen and deliver it to them. He's now been pardoned, so it seems to be a mixed record.

Trump goes for maximum pressure, than flip flops and goes for great courtesy. That's how it is with all dictators. Duterte, Bolsanero, Xi and even Erdogan.

Erdogan pisses the US off, gets hit, they talk, there's peace, he does something again (put troops near the nuclear missiles in Turkey, leak intelligence, buy Russian gear, invade and occupy, kidnap a foreigner...) rinse and repeat.

The same old con.

Tell me if you lot ""dealt with him"", why is Erdogan doing the same thing again? Why is the US meeting with them again? I already said threats were temporary, the US is not special in that regards.

&gt;Dictators

Like when Trump waxed on about Kim Jong-un's ""love letter"", and let him off afterwards? Once again, your mantra that he ""gets things done is a joke"". It's all grand gestures and half finished policies that have only eroded American influence and power.

Even you must realize how much weaker in a position your country is now? How much less people listen in comparison to the Bush era?

&gt;Lesson

God forbid anyone else pick up his strategy of grandiose threats followed by accomodations that only help the dictator in the long run. I think the US has hurt more democracies than dictatures these past few years.

&gt;EU

The EU that is ""worse than China""? The allies that the US racqueteered with Cost plus 50? The trade war's tariffs has never gone down, thinking about it. While the US swings between hostility and friendliness with dictators, it's only threats with democracies.

Mate, bridges have been burned, at least have the decency to not act like you're shocked and victimized by this hostility.

&gt;Bigotry 

Hilarious. 

To borrow a phrase that was said to me, ""thoughen up snowflake"". I definitely wouldn't address a German, a Brit or someone Turkish this way, but if you Americans engage in shithole country diplomacy, you don't get to complain if fronting and frank language is what you get.

2994,"The belligerents: the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the Kingdom of Italy had a string of military confrontations dating back to 1848, with the revolts of Milan and Venice succesfully put to end by field marshal Joseph Radetzky von Radetz. The 1915-1918 Italian front was the the last and the bloodiest of such events.

The White War: The Italian front was divided in two sections, one on the Isonzo (and later, Piave) River and the other one on the Alps. The first failed Italian attempts to break-through on the Isonzo (causing high losses and little territorial gain) spurred a search for new strategies and both High Commands intensified their efforts to outflank the enemy on the Alps. This collection of battles are named ""White War"" (Gebirgskrieg/Guerra Bianca). 
Given the altitude (all battles were fought at above 2000mt) and the extremely harsh alpine winters, both belligerents started to build underground galleries in the mountains and both belligerents employed explosive charges to trap enemy soldiers inside them ([Mines on the Italian front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mines_on_the_Italian_Front_(World_War_I)).

The battle: at the beginning of 1918, the Empire managed to build a fortified position on [Punta San Matteo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punta_San_Matteo). Towering at 3.678mt above sea level and requiring a four hour ice-climb on the southern side to reach its peak, the position could easily shell Italian supply lines without fear of retaliation. 
An *Alpini* mountain infrantry company were tasked with recapturing the San Matteo, the daring plan involving a night-climb from multiple sides. At 21:00 of the 12th of August the soldiers began to ascend for the peak; their advance was hidden to the imperial soldiers by darkness and a thick fog. The next day, caught by surprise and attacked by multiple sides, the austro-hungarians had to surrenter at 12:10.

The loss of San Matteo was extremely embarassing for the military prestige of Empire and the Tyrolean alpine corps. A counteroffensive was immediately planned and, on Semptember 3, operation *Gemse* was launched: after a 3-hour large scale artillery bombardment, 150 Austro-Hungarian soldiers with the support of 10 machineguns managed to recapture the San Matteo at a cost of 17 *Kaiserschützen*. 10 *Alpini*, including commander Arnaldo Berni who lead the succesful ascent, died defending the peak. The position, destroyed by cross-bombardment, was not useful for the rest of the war.

Aftermath: both armies progressively found more and more difficult to advance in the Alps as the front became less elastic and more static, a continuous line of well fortified positions making every attack requiring more and more resources. The dream of a quick resolution of the conflict dissolved, the War had to be fought on rivers (Isonzo first, and then Piave). And at an enormous cost: 450.000 Austro-Hungarian soldiers and more than 600.000 Italian ones never returned home, killed on the battlefield.

If there's one takeaway, this is it:

**Tell me if you lot ""dealt with him"", why is Erdogan doing the same thing again? Why is the US meeting with them again? I already said threats were temporary, the US is not special in that regards**

**Michael Flynn of the US also tried to hand over Gullen to Erdogan**.

You're welcome. I think it might one of your links, since the other comments are there, but I don't know which one.

Reading your other comments didn't change my opinion by the way. Firstly, because you do realize the Turks killed Kurdish fighters, right? The abandonment was blatant.

https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/10/trump-syria-kurds-turkey.html https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/10/14/turkish-backed-forces-freeing-islamic-state-prisoners-syria/ https://newint.org/features/2020/07/13/turkey-ramps-war-kurds-northern-iraq%C2%A0

It set back the fight against ISIS.

I'm not sure if I even need sources, because it was only months ago. If your argument is that it isn't true because some Kurds are still there, after the news of fighters being killed, villages and politicians being surrounded was on the front page here, it's truly grotesque.The Armenians still exist, that means the Ottomans didn't do anything, right?

So, I want to make sure. Are you or are you not denying that Kurds were killed by the Turkish, following Trump's phone call with Erdogan?

&gt;Russia

They shelled a group of Turkish soldiers whom Turkey's government pretended were not there. It's a fraying alliance of interests, the US is out, now it's just Turkey and Russia competing.

&gt;French soldiers in MENA

We never had soldiers apart from a few commandos there, same as the British. Commandos whose missions reportedly had to be cancelled because eof the speed of the retreat.

The army is in the Sahel.

&gt;pastor

Yes, and the Turkish still haven't backtracked on their economic retaliations for that. Very effective, but Michael Flynn of Trump's adminstration also negotiated with Turkey to kidnap Fethullah Gülen and deliver it to them. He's now been pardoned, so it seems to be a mixed record.

Trump goes for maximum pressure, than flip flops and goes for great courtesy. That's how it is with all dictators. Duterte, Bolsanero, Xi and even Erdogan.

Erdogan pisses the US off, gets hit, they talk, there's peace, he does something again (put troops near the nuclear missiles in Turkey, leak intelligence, buy Russian gear, invade and occupy, kidnap a foreigner...) rinse and repeat.

The same old con.

Tell me if you lot ""dealt with him"", why is Erdogan's doing the same thing again? Why is the US meeting with them again? I already said threats were temporary, the US is not special in that regards.

&gt;Dictators

Like when Trump waxed on about Kim Jong-un's ""love letter"", and let him off afterwards? Once again, your mantra that he ""gets things done is a joke"". It's all grand gestures and half finished policies that have only eroded American influence and power.

Even you must realize how much weaker in a position your country is now? How much less people listen in comparison to the Bush era?

&gt;Lesson

God forbid anyone else pick up his strategy of grandiose threats followed by accomodations that only help the dictator in the long run. I think the US has hurt more democracies than dictatures these past few years.

&gt;EU

The EU that is ""worse than China""? The allies that the US racqueteered with Cost plus 50? The trade war's tariffs has never gone down, thinking about it. While the US swings between hostility and friendliness with dictators, it's only threats with democracies.

Mate, bridges have been burned, at least have the decency to not act like you're shocked and victimized by this hostility. Otherwise it reminds me too much of the crying after the Bush era.

&gt;Bigotry

Hilarious.

You do realize that the U.S was a really well established democratic power in the 1920s and had existed as a free republic for over 100 years? It's pretty clear that even back then being a dictator was really backwards.

So in other words you are saying that as long as the dictator is secular(Which Ataturk wasn't), then it's okay for him to ruthlessly crush his own citizens and prevent any sort of free exercise of democracy?

However, these £27,000 loans go on the government books as English government spending as they're guaranteed by the government.. 

So for every loan an English student takes out, Scotland gets extra funding via Barnett Formula (which calculates how much money Scoltand should get from central government..

So, English students first have to pay their own tuition. Then they have to pay those tuition fees back, as loan payments. Then they also have to fucking pay extra tax to the Scottish, for the privilege of having to spend £27,000 on uni. 

Incredible. 

And the kicker? The Scots are the reason England got tuition fees in the first place. 

Blair gave Scotland devolution, and education became devolved. He then whipped all his MP's to vote through tuition fees for England. This included Scottish MP's, who knew they were voting on an issue they'd not ever have to answer to their constituents about. 

Had those Scottish MP's abstained, Blair would have lost the vote, and England wouldn't have got tuition fees. 

Oh, but wait. There's another kicker... Scotland extends free uni tuition to EU students, but not English students.

And Scotland, after all this, will claim they have it real hard in the UK and England is a meanie. Give me a fucking break.",,/r/europe/comments/i8bh5f/majority_of_scots_support_independence_from_uk/g197oyv/,SonWutRUdoin,1597265544

According to friends that just returned from a vacation in France (I know..), there's a fairly detrimental side effect to the masks; People seem to forgo social distancing ""because they're already wearing a mask, so it's ""safe"""".

At least where I'm living (not a big city admittedly); People are still abiding by social distancing very well, and stores are still properly restricting numbers inside by mandatory baskets/shopping carts which are available in limited numbers.

We were able to properly quench the growth/spread once before without masks outside specific situations (like public transport). So I'm not convinced we NEED to enforce masks to do so again; But that does require a bit of faith in our population being able to forgo trips, beaches, bars, etc. for a bit longer (where enforcing masks might very well push those people over the edge into US type behavior).

&amp;#x200B;

I believe those positions that pretend everyone is exactly the same and demand everyone is treated in exactly the same way are just as unrealistic and arbitrary as the racist ones (while being undoubtedly nobler, it must be said).

The point is, we must start to think (and thus talk) of these issues inside a framework that discourages irreconcilable/absolute/undisputable opinions like ""they are our brethren""/""they are barbarians"", least we will go nowhere and continue jumping at each other's throat (which, by the way, makes immigration absorb more resources/brain time than it should, to the detriment of other themes which end up being under-represented in our political agendas).

&amp;#x200B;

By the way:

""Race"" has always been a made-up concept, a stand-in for whatever triggers xenophobia. If you read the Italian (Fascist) ""Manifesto della razza"", the first points try to prove the existence of ""races"", a sign that not even at that time the concept was widely accepted.

Now, when people reason discriminating people in arbitrary groups, whether or not they use the term ""race"" to name such groups is of little consequence.

In these day and age one has to be wary of calling such people ""racists"", because, while the easy rebuttals (like yours) who claim ""it's not race but culture/history/religion/whatever"") don't stand to scrutiny, they still succeed in derailing and stalling the conversation.",Italy,/r/europe/comments/i8e92h/lithuania_allows_belarusians_to_enter_for/g18rjre/,giorgiga,1597258128

3235,"Some factors that played a role: 

1. the concept of duty. For Nazis/SS soldiers the concept of duty had a quasi-religious aura. It wasn't just noble behavior. Whenever they had doubts about what they were doing, they emphasized their duty/their oath. Himmler specifically explained to the Einsatzgruppen that they should remember their duty whenever their task seems like it's unbearable. Many Nazi war criminals when they were tried after the war couldn't possible concieve that their (military) duty wasn't in fact the highest moral instance. They honestly meant it when they said ""But it was my duty!"", ""I just followed orders"" or ""I've sworn an oath!"". Hannah Arendt in fact made fun of Eichmann for not even being able to realize that duty ends with the death of a person. 


2. The horrors of war. When death becomes part of your daily life, you eventually become dull. ISIS soldiers or Mexicans cartell members aren't genetically more brutal than other people. They've simply become used to it. 


3. Conformity pressure. Pretty self-explanatory.


4. Specifically about murdering kids: there was a clear reasoning given: ""If you don't kill them, they will grow up and become the same kind of problem"". To quote the recently convicted former Auschwitz guard Oskar Gröning:

3271,"&gt; The only valid sanction is to not recognize the election result.

The EU has declared that the election was not free or fair and failed to meet international standards. It can't control what happens within Belarus.

&gt; On 9 August, Presidential elections took place in the Republic of Belarus. 
&gt; 
&gt; The EU has been following the developments leading to the presidential elections closely. During the electoral campaign, the people of Belarus have demonstrated the desire for democratic change.
&gt; 
&gt; However, the elections were neither free nor fair. 
&gt; 
&gt; State authorities deployed disproportionate and unacceptable violence causing at least one death and many injuries. Thousands of people were detained and the crackdown on freedoms of assembly, media and expression intensified. We call on the Belarusian authorities to release immediately and unconditionally all detained. 
&gt; 
&gt; Furthermore, credible reports of domestic observers show that the electoral process did not meet the international standards expected of an OSCE participating State.
&gt; 
&gt; The people of Belarus deserve better.
&gt; 
&gt; Since the 2015 release of political prisoners, the relationship between the EU and Belarus had improved. But without progress on human rights and the rule of law, the EU-Belarus relationship can only get worse.
&gt; 
&gt; It is against this background that we will be assessing the Belarusian authorities’ actions to address the current situation and conducting an in-depth review of the EU’s relations with Belarus. This may include, inter alia, taking measures against those responsible for the observed violence, unjustified arrests, and falsification of election results.
&gt; 
&gt; We call on Belarusian political leadership to initiate a genuine and inclusive dialogue with broader society to avoid further violence. The EU will continue to support a democratic, independent, sovereign, prosperous and stable Belarus.

It makes sense since the normal military budget isn't enough to both keep up the normal expenses and the cost of the new aircraft.

It wouldn't make any more sense to temporarily increase the military budget just so it could be used on the fighters and then lower it back again, since we're talking about one-time expense. (The operating costs and maintenance will come out of the normal military budget, of course.)

Either way doesn't matter to the total military expenditure, it's just a budgeting thing.

&gt; Finland would totally rise up on this list after the trade takes in place. Its like 10 billion euros.

Well, it's 10 billion euros over 10 years or so, which comes to an increase of about 0.35% of the GDP (pending the development of the GDP).

&gt;Denazification was carried out in an increasingly lenient and lukewarm way until being officially abolished in 1951. The American government soon came to view the programme as ineffective and counterproductive. Additionally, the programme was hugely unpopular in Germany and was opposed by the new West German government of Konrad Adenauer.[3] On the other hand, denazification in the Soviet zone was considered a critical element of the transformation into a socialist society and was quickly and effectively put into practice.

The U.S. conducted opinion surveys in the American zone of occupied Germany.[85] Tony Judt, in his book Postwar: a History of Europe since 1945, extracted and used some of them.[86]

&gt;A majority in the years 1945–1949 stated National Socialism to have been a good idea but badly applied.[85]

&gt;In 1946, 6% of Germans said the Nuremberg trials had been unfair.[85]

&gt;In 1946, 37% in the US occupation zone said about the Holocaust that ""the extermination of the Jews and Poles and other non-Aryans was necessary for the security of Germans"".[85]

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denazification

&gt;In 1946, 1 in 3 in the US occupation zone said that Jews should not have the same rights as those belonging to the Aryan race.[85]

&gt;In 1950, 1 in 3 said the Nuremberg trials had been unfair.[85]

&gt;In 1952, 37% said Germany was better off without the Jews on its territory.[85]

That would be a reasonable train of thought if you assume that the electoral college is bound by the vote of the people. It isn't though, at least not everywhere, and therefore their decision does not represent the vote of the people.

Just as an aside, this is because the complexity of a EU/US trade deal is considerably greater than a UK/US deal simply because there are more interested parties, and the EU represents a massively diverse set of economies with massively different needs. You can take something like citrus fruit and realise that's a massive contentious issue for Spain and the US, not an issue at all for the UK..

That's not what the shadow of fascism would do, like the US constitution enshrines a bunch of things that don't belong in a constitution, because of their recent war with Britain, e.g the 2nd and 3rd admendents don't really belong in a modern constitution, they're just reactions to British rule, and the right of a leader to pardon, is just straight up taken from kings without much rational thought put into it.

Yes, we've established that but I'm a firm believer in democracy and self-determination, so I think rSpain **should** allow them to leave if they want to, hell if Catalonia had been devolved this right 20 years ago, this would all be moot because only the act of ignoring the will of Catalonians has emboldened them and given them more support.

East Slavic transliteration to English is a complex subject. Many standards exist, even what the governments use change every couple of years. What common people use in forums like these also differs from more standardized transliteration often. Many just do it wrong, e.g. transliterate  Belarusian or Ukrainian to English as if it was Russian. Like in here.

What's interesting about this piece text is, they actually published it in Belarusian which what very few people use on daily basis.

On top of that, you also translate names as you switch between these three East Slavic languages (I don't know about other languages of ex Soviet Union, maybe this custom exist there as well, my knowledge doesn't go that far). 

So when you speak about the guy in say Ukrainian, he becomes Oleksandr Lukashenko (Олександр Лукашенко) in this context.

-Europeans cluster together, and between their three ancestral groups - the steppe people(Indo-Europeans), the Neolithic farmers(which came from Anatolia), and the indigenous hunter-gatherers, showing that all Europeans are descended from these groups, but in various percentages.

-Middle Easterners are related to Europeans, but distinct from the and also cluster together. The Europeans which have a higher degree of famer ancestry cluster closer to the Middle Easterners, which totally makes sense.

-Ashkenazi Jews are between Middle Easterners and Europeans, which also makes sense as they are basically a mix of both.

-Iranians and the people of the Caucasus are closer to Europeans, and specifically to those Europeans which have a high degree of steppe ancestry, than other people of the Middle East(I know they are not really from the Middle East, but they do cluster genetically with them) - again, due to historic migrations of Indo-European peoples.

Keep in mind that the Tor Browser is also available for Android (PlayStore, F-Droid, and APK download), and the 3rd party Onion Browser for iOS is endorsed by the Tor Project.

It might be a good idea to get everyone you know to at least install it on all their devices. So that if the Tor Project site gets blocked you already have it.

Also this might be a good time to look up checksum and PGP signature checking of files to ensure that the installation files for the Tor Browser that you get from a third party, or even the official Tor Project site (should your government attempt to modify the download traffic), are actually the legit files and haven't been tampered with.

3519,"&gt; IP ban then. Happy?

IPs are not assigned to people. One person usually has multiple IPs (for example on mobile, when you switch cell tower you might also switch IP), and multiple people can share one IP.

&gt; You do realise that you can post image links right? You do know how posting on Reddit works?

URLs are not copyrightable content. You can even just get a link shortener and post the same copyrighted work again, and that's not even considering uploading it once again somewhere else. Again, one copyrighted work can have multiple URLs and one URL can contain multiple copyrighted works.

&gt; Let's say someone sues Reddit for not doing enough to stop a picture from being posted. They go to court and claim that Reddit should have been stopping people from uploading the image. All Reddit has to do is show that small section of the article ""The application of this Article shall not lead to any general monitoring obligation"" and just like that the case is closed.

That's not how the EU works. This document is not law, it's a directive for lawmakers. They're required to interpret this in any way they seem fit and write a law about it. This is why I wrote in my original post in this thread that time is very short and we don't even know yet what content platforms have to implement. This is not even a theoretical issue for me, I'm the developer of a small content sharing platform and I personally have to implement these upload filters, but my country hasn't even released a draft document about what has to go online in four months yet.

So, reddit might be able to point to some law stating that upload filters are not required, but there's no requirement for lawmakers to actually write that into law. The directive only says that lawmakers must not require upload filters explicitly.",Vienna (Austria),/r/europe/comments/i87wxl/joe_biden_will_favour_deal_with_eu_over/g17j8lg/,anlumo,1597236542

3605,"&gt;In Germany, riot police units get assembled from regular police whenever they're needed and are composed of the lowest ranking officers of the regional police forces.

Wrong. The ""riot police"" is actually three different things.

1. The Bereitschaftspolizei, which are essentially standing units (their concept actually originates from military!). They're *not* assembled of regular police, to the contrary: they assist regular police in everyday works. Additionally, all ""regular police"" officers have to serve in one of the Bereitschaftspolizei units during their training. Only after their training is done, they either move on to regular police work (e.g. in precincts, in investigations, ...) or stay in the Bereitschaftspolizei.  
Generally, while these are not as chill as regular cops, these pose no major issue for the average person.
2. The special riot units (usually called BFE/Beweissicherungs- und Festnahmeeinheit, with the exception of Bavaria where it is called USK/Unterstützungskommando). These are the worst of the worst, *fuck them*. And if you are on a demonstration or a soccer game, *stay away from them as far as possible*.
3. The Spezialeinsatzkommando (best equivalent: SWAT teams). They are rare and trained for anti-terror, hostage and high-risk arrest (mafiya) situations - which however doesn't exclude them from being used against left-wing demonstrations (e.g. in Saxony and Hamburg/G20). *If you see these, run*.",Bavaria (Germany),/r/europe/comments/i7r74c/17_years_of_service_are_over_my_conscience_is/g179zcd/,mschuster91,1597229147

The earliest and most reliable sources describe the execution of eight hundred to one thousand soldiers or citizens and the local bishop, but none mention a conversion as a condition of clemency. Even more telling, neither a contemporary Turkish chronicle nor Italian diplomatic reports mention martyrdom. One would imagine that if such a report were circulating, humanists and preachers would have seized on it.

Turkey entering the conflict would be a rogue act against the will of her own allies. Russia is containing Turkey in accordance with the US and EU. Any act carried out by Russia in defense of Armenia would have the green light of the others.

Another thing is of course if Russia goes rogue in the region, or another third party such as Iran decides to do something, but the latter doesn’t seem probable, and the balance so far has maintained Russia happy (she gets what she wants from both Armenia and Azerbaijan).",,/r/europe/comments/i7x7tl/russias_antiaccessarea_denial_capabilities/g173k3g/,Idontknowmuch,1597222680

3855,"&gt;If someone is killed, does it really matter how?

Um yes? People are killed all the time via blunt force trauma, strangulation, arson, stabbing, etc. In the UK where guns are practically banned for civilians, the most common, and growing type of murder are stabbings. There's literally community outreach programs in cities like London to prevent young people in gangs to stop stabbing each other.

https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2019/04/27/knife-crime-britain-wales-national-emergency-record-stabbing-homicides/3470942002/

&gt;Is a murder with a knife better for society than a murder with a gun?

So should we ban knives as well? 

&gt;Gun rights advocates are constantly saying that if we regulate guns, criminals will just shift to other tools,

You're literally proving my point that it doesn't matter what weapon you use, that murder will still exist. 

&gt;Based on what source?

https://www.thetrace.org/2016/10/chicago-gun-violence-per-capita-rate/

They reference the FBI in their stats. 

&gt;Every city in the US of any real significance is run by Democrats. Even in conservative states like Texas, the urban areas are run by Democrats.

That's a matter of demographics, white flight, etc. Many of the cities, especially the ones I listed, were abandoned by whites, occupied by blacks (who mostly vote democrat), and now once again becoming slowly gentrified by young whites fleeing suburbia. Many of these cities are still riddled with gang violence. 

&gt;It's pretty comical that I showed you actual data from a reputable source that displays a clear trend, and you replied with a mixture of rambling and uncited facts.

Uncited facts??? Are you dense? I literally provided the sources under every city I listed, and if you don't believe that they're ran by democrats, a simple google search can help you.

3907,"**Youngest people to fly out of the nest are in Sweden, Luxembourg, Denmark and Finland**

Leaving the parental household is often affected by whether or not young people are in a relationship with partner or studying, their level of financial (in)dependence, labour market conditions, the affordability of housing but also cultural particularities. On average, young people in the EU left the parental household at the age of 26.2 years in 2019. However, this age varied significantly across the EU Member States.

In 2019, young people left home earliest in the three northern Member States – Sweden (17.8 years), Denmark (21.1 years) and Finland (21.8 years), as well as in Luxembourg (20.1 years). Young people also left home before the age of 25 in Estonia (22.2 years), France (23.6 years), Germany and the Netherlands (both with 23.7 years).

**In the southern EU Member States young people move out at around 30**

At the other side of the scale, young adults in Croatia and Slovakia remained the longest in the parental household. They left home on average at the age of 31.8 and 30.9 years respectively. Young adults in Italy (30.1 years), Bulgaria (30.0 years), Malta (29.9 years), Spain (29.5 years), Portugal (29.0 years) and Greece (28.9 years) also remained with their parents for longer.

**Men stay longer at parental home than women**

In almost all EU Member States, young women tended to leave the parental household earlier than men. The only exception was Luxembourg (20.3 years for women, compared with 20.0 years for men).

3965,"&gt; An academic has claimed that, while Donald Trump is looking for a  “symbolic” gesture ahead of the US election, Joe Biden is looking for  more “meaningful” negotiations and is likely to seek out a deal with the  European Union first.  
&gt;  
&gt;Dalibor Rohac, a research fellow at the  American Enterprise Institute at the London School of Economics, warned  in one of his latest blogs that “the United States is heading into an  election season with the disastrous economic fallout from the COVID-19  pandemic”  
&gt;  
&gt;He explained: “Meaningful trade agreements require  difficult compromises on both sides, upsetting interest groups. That is  not what the incumbent administration is after.  
&gt;  
&gt;“With the announcement that the agreement ought to be completed in a  year, everything suggests that president Trump is looking for an easy,  purely symbolic gesture which furthermore stands no chance of getting  through the current House of Representatives.”  
&gt;  
&gt;And  he added that Biden’s administration “would be ill-advised to tie its  hands with a UK trade deal before a return to some version of updated  TTIP \[Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership\] negotiations with  the European Union.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Biden advocated for the TTIP talks when he  was vice-president under Barack Obama, with the president at the time  warning the UK could end up “back of the queue” if it voted for Brexit.  
&gt;  
&gt;Negotiations  between the US and EU were halted under Trump, but Biden is said to  favour a return of these talks over the offer of a Free Trade Agreement  between the UK and US, with the Democratic Party in America continuing  to signal a lack of enthusiasm for Brexit.  
&gt;  
&gt;Earlier this month it was reported [**Boris Johnson’s administration is “desperate” for Biden to win the US election**](https://www.theneweuropean.co.uk/top-stories/boris-johnson-team-want-joe-biden-to-win-1-6764737) to allow for more meaningful talks over Brexit with conditions that would make a deal more palatable.",,/r/europe/comments/i87wxl/joe_biden_will_favour_deal_with_eu_over/g16plek/,yolo4everlmi,1597209747

4000,"&gt; Yeah sure. As if the US was willing to loose their second strongest economic ally and risk a full on trade war with the EU. Midst escalating tensions with China which seems to be on the best way to become the new economic superpower.

First, the US is circling the wagons on Russia and China. It remains to be seen which side of the wagons Germany will be on. And that’s the point, the US can make an example out of Germany that this behavior won’t stand. Second, Germany cannot rally the EU around a trade war with the US while the entire Eastern bloc stands with the US on the issue. Third, Germany is more of a liability than an ally with China [check out 45 seconds.](https://youtu.be/shlL4sc82l4) further examples include Huawei.

&gt; While they are overstretched to the point where both parties advertise ""bringing the boys home"" every election and Russia gets to keep Syria because the USA can't afford another dragged out proxy war and is still recovering from an economic crash.

The US is not overstretched on budget at all. Do not confuse US wanting to disengage with ME wars because of economic cost. The US wants to disengage with those wars for 3 reasons. First, the US is now energy independent so the region has lost its strategic value. Second, the US public has lost interest. It has nothing to do with economic cost. Lastly, the US is transitioning from insurgent warfare back to near peer warfare; ie China and Russia. 

&gt; And mind you, the EU has as much GDP as the USA. the actors in the adversary box are doing badly because they get sanctioned by both the USA as well as the EU. Guess what happens if the adversary box starts outgrowing the countries sanctioning the adversaries.

[The EU GDP is 75% of the US and losing value in comparison. ](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?locations=EU-US-CN) furthermore, the EU is a loose economic collection that does not have an interest in a trade war with the US nor will it support Germany in furthering it’s dependence on Russian energy. The US economy is massively internal and the small amount of trade it does is basically with Canada and Mexico. If the entire EU sanctioned the US, the US would be completely fine. 

&gt; Trump backed off after the last mini trade war with the EU, even he knows that escalation with the EU long term harms the USA more than anything else.

It’s a well known fact that the EU is at a massive disadvantage to the US in a trade war. 

&gt; I think the USA needs to read up the difference between an ally and a vassal state. Also lol @ unreliable after breaking the Iran deal and cancelling tons of international mostly paperweight treaties because they didn't fit Trump's election program.

I think Germany needs to understand that the US won’t allow certain things to pass. And the US has the ability to enforce that and Germany doesn’t have any real way to fight it. In a bilateral negotiation the US can absolutely crush Germany.

So whilst Russian military has serious fighting power it is going to seriously suffer from the same incompetence and corruption that infects every aspect of society in a totalitarian state. 

Something russian forces got to know first hand when they overstepped their boundaries in Syria and was ruthlessly corrected by the US in a 4h battle where the US more or less obliterated the combined russian-syrian force that stepped out of line.

* if the US sanctions Germany, then the whole EU would retaliate. The EU's high representative of foreign policy has already hinted at that. Just because NS2 is not supported by all EU member states doesn't mean that the EU would accept US sanctions against Germany without retaliation since that would be interpreted as an attack on the EU as a whole.

When you're sentenced and moved to a proper jail later you still get the special treatment: they can move homeless people to your cell so you catch some kind of disease or a parasite, they can empty a chlorine-based solution into the cell that irritates eyes, they don't let you sleep and wake you up every 15 minutes.

4328,"I would like to start with the background.  This summer 2020 the presidential elections in the Republic of Belarus were to be held.  Before that, Alexander Lukashenko was in power, having seized power in the country after the collapse of the USSR (26 years ago).  On August 9, 2020, presidential elections were held, according to the results of which Lukashenko won with a score of 80.23%.  Everything would be fine but it was falsification.  In fact, no more than 30% of voters support him.  It was a brazen production.
 It all started long after the elections themselves.  Back in early June, people went out into the streets and peacefully protested against the current government, fought for fair elections.  A couple of days before the vote, unofficial sources warned there would be internet interruptions.  On August 9, the Internet was turned off.  Even the largest social services did not work.  network in the CIS - Vkontakte.
 On election day, filming was not allowed at polling stations; those who were with cameras were simply thrown out into the street and chased away.

 Immediately after, peaceful rallies began - no weapons or violence from the protesters.  People just walk the streets and chant different slogans.  And here the complete trash begins ...
 The incumbent president, even before the elections, began to pull military equipment into cities.  Peaceful rallies ceased to be peaceful, and aggression from the security forces began.  Here are a couple of videos so that you understand what this is about:

Special forces simply does not just disperse the protesters by force, they use tear gas, rubber bullets and simply beat peaceful people with truncheons.

The US is stretched thin, and Euro militaries are, for most part, a joke. The UK would be unable to fight even the Falkland war today, and German military is in a pitiful state. France has a relatively strong military for self protection, but not nearly strong enough to back up an active foreign policy.

Of course there's economic strength... which is waning.

The new world will go back to multi-polarity - and this will **inevitably** end up in wars and dictatorships. Its already happening.  India and Pakistan, China and most of its neighbors, Russia sticking its middle finger up, attacking its neighbors, and assassinating people in broad daylight in the UK and Germany. Because what are they going to do, stop buying Russian gas for German homes ? Or take a military action if Russia decides to openly invade Ukraine ? Get real.

Income inequality is no problem at all?

&gt; The quality of life of people around the world has reached its peak, including Eastern Europe. Thirty years of capitalism has brought my country out of fifty years of soviet misery and the people are wealthier than ever.

If you wanna play that game, my origin place is the middle east. Capitalist interests and the American state that serves them have brought civil war, mass death, zionism, the spread of wahabbism, lots of sectarianism and the dissolution of secular unity, complete destruction of civil society, multiple refugee crisis that your fucking European countries have to bear the brunt of, and the dominance of the oil industry which furthers global warming and threatens civilization as we know it. But Iraq and soon Syria will have McDonalds so it's all good I guess.

 &gt; I'm not petty or jealous enough to fuck everyone else over because someone else is doing much better than myself.

Do you actually think millionaires and billionaires got rich from their own hard work? Nine times out of ten, if even that, either inherited their money or just soaked up money from the hundreds of people under them who do the actual productive labor.

&gt; Either way, pull your head out of your ass and smell the roses - you aren't being drafted to fight in Afghanistan,

If you think capitalist countries don't conscript their citizens to fight in imperialist wars I dont know what to tell you. Also, even without conscription, many poor people are essentially forced to the join army because every other option is usually out of reach.

&gt; the government isn't covering up nuclear leaks

Capitalist countries have plenty of government cover ups and nuclear oopsies.

&gt; and you don't have to wait five years to buy a car.

I won't pretend to know the specifics of every country but in America most people cant afford cars period.

&gt; And most importantly - you can actually change how you live, go wherever you want 

Except poor people in most capitalist countries literally cant afford to?

Greece has none of these disadvantages and would be able to focus the entirety of their considerable armed forces on that one situation, backed by the EU or not.

Tbh I hate current goverment pretty heavily too, I'm classical liberal and trust me if there is something we oppose nearly as much as globalist socialism it must be conservative socialism which is the current main thought of rulling party, but claiming we're going towards fascism is quite ridicoulous. We have better standards of free speech than the West it seems this days (no press offices are being bombed for attacking any kind of religion for example and our press is quite vicious towards all religions and atheism, like if you aren't here you may not have the full picture, but every side is attacked pretty equally by multiple magazines, newspapers and TV programs), we have one of the most robust systems to ensure fair elections (there's no gerry mendering as voting zones were set decades ago at this point and we have multiple levels of checks by people that aren't proposed by goverment, but by each political side that partakes in it, where every party can have multiple members on a commision, which is basically one per few hundred people) and one of the most diverse parliament in terms of views, where even when parliament members brake the rules of parliament it is ignored as not to indulge in any kind of censorship. Basically our parliament members are more often silenced by EU parliament than by ours.

The far left is just mad that their version of the left isn't winning in Poland and that's somehow shows that it's fascism as they believed in their own lie about one-directional movement of politics, where in fact it's way more complicated and it's perfectly reasonable that in a situation different to the one Western countries found themself in, there would be different political forces that gained prominency.",Pomerania (Poland),/r/europe/comments/i7bam7/statement_from_lithuania_poland_ukraine_regarding/g14o4o3/,Ussurin,1597171918

4570,"&gt; I read these so many times on news; cuz of treaties agreed, Greece not allowed to deploy military development in islands close to Turkey. I'm not trying to justify a war but IMO it's a casus belli for Turkey on Greece.

Looking at this [it seems that Kastellorizo isn't one of those islands that were to be demilitarized anyway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aegean_dispute#Demilitarized_status) so it shouldn't matter.

&gt;And read these many times, Greece's EEZ zones doesn't declared to the UN. This justifies Turkey's aggressive movements. 

I'm not sure what you're trying to say but the Greek claims are backed by UNCLOS agreement that Turkey hasn't signed. There also hasn't been a specific court decision on the matter if that's what you're trying to say?

&gt;After all of these, without great knowledge of sea law's I think, we are in a big problem of geography. Greece has islands, i read islands can't have EEZ like a continental earth(i cant find better word for it). 

Only if the island is quite literally just a small rock. If it can have people naturally living there then it's large enough to have EEZ.

&gt;Imho, we need to go judges for this and other few problems. And 2 of us gonna be sad about result no matter what.

I'm angry though that Poland is moving towards renewables so slowly. Our landscape and climate are pretty similar to those in Germany so it should be possible to follow the example with wind turbines and solar plants. The issue is controllability of energy production, while you can achieve good mean production of energy you cannot rapidly increase or decrease it, for that you need things such as water plants in dams. Polish hydrology is not that well suited for this task as we only have a limited number of dams and not many suitable places. The environmental cost of dams is also quite high. Coal plants are a technology that must be abandoned, but they allow the power output control in reasonable time frames, which is needed.

4731,"&gt;\[paraphrasing\] Not everybody has the time to properly figure out who it's best to vote for

This  is an utterly trivial issue to fix. Engineering/technical issues shouldn't be a valid excuse for passively letting authoritarianism win in your country.

This is particularly important nowadays, as totalitarianism is at an all-history low, and we have a real shot at getting completely ( or as close as we can get ) rid of it within our lifetimes.

That's exciting, **RIGHT**?

Here are multiple solutions that help you help everybody by helping the Nazis the minimum possible amount:

# Easy solution #1

Find somebody you trust the wisdom of. Family, friend, even a public figure like Keanu Reeves \[note1, see bottom of manifesto\]. Ask them or otherwise figure out how they'll vote.

You can even not ask that if you worry about privacy, by instead asking them how they would recommend you vote based on what they know of your beliefs, and now this becomes a fun hypothetical for them, and a lesson for you.

This takes you minutes,  every few years ( or takes you minutes once in your life if you like never changing your mind and think your beliefs are perfect, which they obviously are if they were given to you by  Keanu Reeves ).

You can take the time off your day for this, don't lie. No boss is going to get upset at you if the reason you skipped minutes of work involved  Keanu, so this is a rock-solid plan/method.

You now know who to vote for.

The day of the election, show up and cast a vote according to the help you got.

There, problem solved! You avoided voting for fascists. **This method is vastly superior to not voting.**

# Easy solution #2

You went to school, meaning you know what the most basic/obvious signs of authoritarianism/dictatorships are, if not Wikipedia will fix that for you in minutes. If you are not cognitively developed enough to use  Wikipedia, ask me and I'll help.

Now  ask Google for shortened versions of each candidate's political platform, these exist for all politicians that campaign, ever, always.  Don't use that politician's own website, ideally use two newspapers with opposing views.

For each candidate, read each of the shortened versions of the platform/plan,  making a note each time something sounds totalitarian/authoritarian.

Vote for the candidate that has the fewest «this might be a bit fascist or at least authoritarian» notes.

There, problem solved! You avoided voting for fascists. **This method is also vastly superior to not voting.**

\[note1\]  When I say «Find somebody you trust the wisdom of. Family, friend, even a public figure like Keanu Reeves», this includes imaginary individuals. I used to hold the view that imaginary individuals are not able to provide one with wisdom, and therefore were not adequate providers of wisdom in the context of this advice I'm giving. However,  some people have taken the time to educate me and make me realize that being-real-privilege is a thing and that I shouldn't discriminate in such obvious ways. So just remember, you can get political advice from  anyone, even from imaginary people ( like Dumbledore or Fievel and the  people who say you can't be bigots.)",,/r/europe/comments/i6qs51/violent_protests_erupt_in_belarus_reports_of/g13hw74/,arthurwolf,1597150201

1. Brexit is likely to be less of a rupture than had been predicted. I doubt that the UK will crumble and decline, but I also doubt that it will soar.
2. Britain is in a far better position to leave than the other countries are. **First of all**, because it was less integrated into the EU than the other four. No Euro. No Schengen. And a high share (50%) of non-EU trade. **Secondly**, the City of London. A services-based emporium that establishes global connections via pre-existing contracts, a stellar reputation, and alumni networks via the UK's highly globalized universities. **Third**, the UK has a very pro-business agenda that makes it attractive for investors. **Fourth**, the political system ensures a stable and usually pro-business environment.

It's roots can be traced the Nazis in Germany, which often incorporated light and fire in it's propaganda -- including the use of torches during marches. Yet what's so incredibly frightening about the now common use of the Tiki Torch is that it only took the Neo-Nazi movements around 50 years to learn it's use. In an interview one member recently summarized it as follows: ""Long wood stick heavy and make ouchie often, little bamboo with metal fire box lighter and burn better. Kalbitz so smart!""

2. Non-compliance with human rights - check (present in US politics before Trump)
3. Identification of enemies as a cause to rally behind - check (present in US politics before Trump)

5. Rampamt racism - check (present in US politics before Trump)
6. Mass media either controlled or discredited - check
7. Obsession with national security - check (present in US politics before Trump)
8. Non-secularism, religion is used for government purposes - check
9. Corporate rights and powers are protected above citizens' - check (present in US politics before Trump)
10. Labour rights supressed - check (present in US politics before Trump)
11. Disdain for intelectualism and the arts - check
12. Extreme focus on crimes, perceived and not, and punishment - check (present in US politics before Trump)
13. Rampant cronyism and corruption - check

Anyway, the situation can only be and will be decided in the Capital. My only worry is Putin - he has a tight grip on Luka now. If protesters start to gain strength, Putin will send his bloodthirsty interior troops to save Luka (which is gonna be an end of his relative independence).

They also tried to provoke people numerous times to attack seemingly unguarded positions(completely ridiculous suggestions, as protesters were protesting, not overtaking buildings), and even pretending there are already protesters there winning the fight so more would join. In reality, there was a shitton of swat hiding inside those places and all around the place. Gladly, most of those provocations were uncovered in time. And those that weren't just gained no traction, as no civilians were up that night to pick up a fight.  
  
The news about Tsikhanouskaya getting detained and held inside a certain facility was one of those provocations - an attempt to make protesters feel like they have lost their leader. Which is actually pretty ironic, since the great dictator was actually the one not showing himself on the face of earth, probably hiding his wrinkly old ass inside a bunker and shaking from fear as if the protesters were already setting up a guillotine outside his hideout.",,/r/europe/comments/i6u4ma/belarusian_presidential_election_megathread/g12myxr/,EtheusProm,1597122319

&gt;White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany on Monday told reporters that the administration is “deeply concerned” about an election process “marred” by restrictions and intimidation against candidates, the blocking of independent election observers, “and the detention of peaceful protesters and journalists.”  
“We urge the Belarusian government to respect the right to peaceably assemble and to refrain from the use of force,” she said.  
&gt;  
&gt;Secretary of State [Mike Pompeo](https://thehill.com/people/mike-pompeo) on Monday said the elections were “not free and fair” and urged the Belarusian government to respect the rights of peaceful protesters and condemned the use of internet shutdowns in an attempt to prevent citizens from gathering.  
“We urge the Belarusian government to respect the rights of all Belarusians to participate in peaceful assembly, refrain from use of force, and release those wrongfully detained,” Pompeo said in a statement. “We strongly condemn ongoing violence against protesters and the detention of opposition supporters, as well as the use of internet shutdowns to hinder the ability of the Belarusian people to share information about the election and the demonstrations.”

Ostensibly elections were held even in ex-Yu. Granted, there was only one part of the balot but there were election.

Most recent example would be Serbian elections one month ago.

So, out of all ex-YU countries, Montenegro was the last country that officially seceded from Serbia. During that time despite being in an union with Serbia they did have their own president and prime minister. They had their own party that has existed since 91, Milo Đukanović has been party's president for the majority of it's existence. Before the succession referendum he has been going between positions of prime minister and president more or less in the same manner Putin is switching between those positions. The same trend continued after they declared indepedence, with some small gaps where one of his other close cooworkers would take over some of those positions in the government.

5307,"&gt;Serious question

Since you asked so nicely: A Greece-Turkey war will be a war of the naval and aviation branches. There will be no ground forces mobilization like there was in WW2. Our land borders are impassable for either side and islands might or might not be able to be defended / captured within the first hours of the conflict, but after that navy and air will rule supreme. 

Sooner or later (read: within a week) one country will materialize an opportunity to destroy most of the enemy's fleet / air-force in well coordinated alpha strike. At this point the war is over. It will be impossible to attack / defend any region with land forces if you cannot support your troops with ships and planes. 

Turkey is in a slightly better position defensively as they don't have many islands that can he held waiting for a ceasefire (and thus ""winning"" them) and a substantial portion of their landmass is outside of a potential Greek air / navy superiority support, but even then Turkey will not send thousands of soldiers to die and tank the economy even further just of the shake of it, if have already lost all their ships and planes.   

All in all, land forces size and domestic arms production will be non factors. Don't get me wrong, domestic arms production is awesome and super important for a country, but it will not help in a Turco-Greek war. Which leaves navy and air and both sides are equally matched at those branches.",Greece,/r/europe/comments/i78szi/turkish_vessel_escorted_by_warships_enters_the/g11xn78/,Etoiles_mortant,1597106857

Once again, I don't think America is a bastion of freedom and democracy, nor do I think they've never committed warcrimes. I agree with a lot of your points, but comparing what it's like living in the United States to what it's like living in Belarus, Russia, the PRC, North Korea, Venezuela, Syria, Turkey, Yemen, Saudia Arabia... Those are all on another level. Yes they are not imperialist, like America. But I'm talking about living under oppression.

Also, imperialism and dictatorships are different things. North Korea is a dictatorship that's not imperialist. Venice (at one point in history) was a democracy that was.

If you want to know what a dictatorship is like, join a humanitarian organization like the Red Cross or Doctors Without Borders. America is a twisted country, and it does need change, but you're insulting the plight of billions of people who have suffered under the yoke of a dictator when you say ""I have it worse, America is the worst.""

5452,"&gt; Two different terms... An immigrant is someone who migrates to somewhere and wants to stay. A migrant is someone who are temporary there.

Migrant

&gt; In the EU/EFTA context, a person who either:
(i) establishes their usual residence in the territory of an EU/EFTA Member State for a period that is, or is expected to be, of at least 12 months, having previously been usually resident in another EU/EFTA Member State or a third country;

&gt; Note(s)
1. At international level, no universally accepted definition for 'migrant' exists, but the UN recommendations for statistics on international migration and on population censuses specifies **at least one year** as the criterion for change of country of usual residence to define this change as ‘migration’.

&gt; 3. The term 'migrant' is usually understood to cover all cases where the decision to migrate is taken freely by the individual concerned for reasons of 'personal convenience' and without intervention of an external compelling factor; it therefore applies to persons, and family members, moving to another country or region to better their material or social conditions and improve the prospect for themselves or their family.

Immigrant

&gt; In the EU context , a person who establishes their usual residence in the territory of an EU Member State for a period that is, or is expected to be, of at least 12 months, having previously been usually resident in another EU Member State or a third country.

Migrantion is just an umbrela term for moving.

edit:

&gt; You have problem with English because you probably don't want to say that biggest minoroty in your country are migrants or 2nd generation migrant that is temporary there.

It's either you or me.

&gt; If they have Slovenian ID (which I guess they do), you don't have any right to call them migrant.

Who called them migrants? They are Slovenians if they deem themself as such. And you are not the one to tell me what my rights are.

&gt; How long somebody has to be in Slovenia in order to be minority after the immigration? 100 years? 200 years? Is there a standard?

For a new national minority to be enetered into constitution, 20 MP's, a government or 30000 citizens needs to propose an initiation of proceeding. It needs 2/3 of positive votes from National Assembly. If 30 MP's demand it, National Assembly needs to call a referendum. Then a majority of voters have to vote in favor. So a pretty long time. In English you may call them a minority, in Slovenian they're just a normal part of society.",Slovenia,/r/europe/comments/i70ozo/immigrants_in_europe/g11lhtg/,lilputsy,1597100198

So yes they did interfere, but so did the U.S. as is evident by the amount of money pouring into Ukraine for ""development"" around the time of the ""revolution"", and the fact that you've had Joe Bidens son employed as a ""consultant"" in the largest Oil company in the country... he steped down due to ""conflict of interests"" but still received 50k monthly severance.

Both Russia and the U.S had their grubby little fingers in Ukraine, and they simply switched to being at the mercy of one, to being at the mercy of the other.

Where Russia fucked up was not Crimea, it was East Ukraine.

5466,"Gonna have a go at this:

&gt;\-Why did the UK leave the EU?

It's complicated. Many reasons, some being true, most being lies.

&gt;\-Why is the UK called like that?

UK is short for United Kingdom, which is short for United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Comes from when England and Scotland unified into 1 country with the Acts of Union in 1707. They became the United Kingdom of Great Britain. Ireland followed just under 100 years later.

&gt;\-Why did the UK entered WW1?

Officially, Germany violated Belgium neutrality as established in the 1839 Treaty of London which established that Belgium neutrality would be respected by the signitory nations, one of those nations being Prussia. When Germany formed, they inherited Prussia's treaty obligations and agreed to maintain the treaty. When Germany invaded in 1914, they broke the treaty so the UK entered the war to protect Belgium neutrality. 

Unofficially, Belgium would give access to coastline that was dangerously close to London, so the UK preferred a neutral, independent Belgium instead of a French or German controlled Belgium. Also, Germany's navy was starting to threaten the Naval Superiority that the Royal Navy had. To ensure the Royal Navy could maintain naval superiority and protect the UK and her Empire, the German navy had to be cut down to size.

&gt;\-Why didn't the UK adopt the euro?

Would have cost Labour the next election if they tried to force it through Parliament. Also the events of [Black Wednesday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Wednesday) happened around 15 years before. UK was 'protective' over their currancy due to this event. As the ERM mechanism that caused the event was an EEC founded mechanism, it would have left a negative impression. The Eurozone crisis would have only strengthed these views.

&gt;\-Why do british people always say ""you know""?

You know, we just do...

&gt;\-Why do british people have bad teeth?

We don't fluoridate our drinking water supply, so we aren't constantly drinking teeth whitener all the time like they do in the US. Considering British teeth are generally healthier than American teeth, that does lead to some interesting results.

&gt;\-Why are british people rich?

The rich are the people more likely to travel to more expensive places in foreign countries, hence the appearance of Brits appearing rich. We also have the remnants of old money from the industrial revolution, family legacies, etc.

&gt;\-Why do british people say ""bravo""?

Your guess is as good as mine.

&gt;\-Why do british people drive on the left?

Well, Napoleon didn't invade so we weren't forced to follow the standards that Napoleonic France established across Europe. Also, when travelling on the left, you would be able to control your horse/cart with your left hand while using your right hand to wield a weapon to attack/defend yourself. The law never needed to change when cars became widespread, they just followed the law as before.

&gt;\-Why do british people drive on the right? (Lol)

Following Italian road laws.

&gt;If you search what british people....  
&gt;  
&gt;\-What do brits eat for lunch?

A quick pint of beer to get you through the rest of the day. Food as well to ease the hunger.

&gt;\-What to brits eat for breakfast?

Depends on how much free time/money you have or how healthy you are. Ranges from cereal to toast to a full English breakfast.

&gt;\-What do brits eat for dinner? (Lol again)

Pint of beer. Food as well.

&gt;\-What do brits think of italians?

See original post by OP.

&gt;If you search how (""how are they"" is the same as ""what are they like)  
&gt;  
&gt;\-what are brits like?

Depends on where the Brit is from in the UK.

&gt;\-what are brits like as for personality?

Snobbish, a bit of banter. Refer to previous answer. 

&gt;\-what are brits like in bed?

Don't know. Never had that experience.

&gt;\-how do brits eat?

How should we eat?

Look at this, Europeans judging us on how we eat. It's reasons like these that are why us leaving the EU was the correct decision. /s

&gt;\-how to do brits distinguish love and affection?

Edit: Just to add something.

&gt;Yeah we are going into a rough time were we will not be one of the more impactuful powers anymore with at least 3 world powers in the world. We need one of them as an ally because it doesn't really look good.

3 world powers? Russia has nukes and is big but i don't think you're looking for some military help. 
..but....That's it. It has a GDP smaller than Italy and i definitely wouldn't place it above India or so.
So it's just that militarized, big, it's natural resources being milked by oligarchs.

&gt;quick google search will show that there were already conflics in Georgia and that the Georgian state is not some victim that didnt do anything wrong.

Ah yeah. I heard these. Something something both sides.

 They were really going for this conflict. Didn't have large very much majority Georgian areas ethnically cleansed in the first conflict. Didn't take any in the second
Definitely weren't having issues with shelling of Georgian villages and roadside bombs whilst the Russian ""peacekeepers"" definitely weren't there just preventing retaliatory where the shelling happened.
Georgia initiated all this (whilst the majority of their combat ready armed forces were outside of the country) and whilst Russian army moved trough the mountainpass a few days earlier. 
Definitely didn't repeatedly call for ceasefires constantly or implementing one themselves as they kept getting attacked.  Totally thought they could just waltz in and take it.

Jesus christ Pavel Felgenhauer and Kavkaz center said Russia was gonna invade a month earlier.
When they finally agreed to negotiate...well. ""Temur Iakobashvili arrived in Tskhinvali for a previously-arranged meeting with South Ossetians and Russian diplomat Yuri Popov; however, Russia's emissary, who blamed a flat tire, did not appear; and neither did the Ossetians."" and so they kept advancing....

5515,"&gt;who assaulted some pro-lifers

Not pro-lifers, but homophobes. The anti-choicer truck with dead foetuses is a different one, the one destroyed was blasting homophobic slogans and equated LGBT people with pedophiles. Also - the inquiry into assault is pending, many witnesses claim it was self-defence.

&gt;and then during the protest she attacked police.

She didn't attack anyone, and done everything to peacefully hand herself into hands of the police. Actually, before events on Krakowskie Przedmieście, she approached police near LGBT NGO where she was staying, to peacefully hand herself over. She was not taken then, despite approaching 3 different police cars. She was apprehended by plain-clothes police around 20 minutes later, with no resistance on her part. At the same time it did trigger a clash with people accompanying her. There was violence, but not triggered by her, only by shitty police tactics, terrible crowd control and herd mentality of people with her. You clearly have no idea what you're talking about.

&gt;Being trans is no excuse for assault, even when you are beating up pro-lifers

It's no excuse in the face of law. Yeah. But after years of violent anti-LGBT propaganda and zero solutions to it from both current and past governments - I don't even blame her. Fuck transphobes. Fuck homophobes. Sometimes you don't make change peacefully and that's a fact. We live on a continent full of freedom built on civil disobedience, physical violence and clashing with the police.

5569,"&gt;given that there are several reports of police attacking and arresting peaceful protesters, how long do you think the protests will continue?

seems like police getting violent is actually riling people up even more from what I'm seeing. I was worried people just wouldn't show up today but there's arguably more resistance from the people tonight, lots of people cars signaling and blocking roads so police can't come through. I've actually read just now that the police aren't even restraining people any more. There's simply nowhere to take them. They can't handle the masses.

&gt;I hope it won’t happen but… what if people just give up at some point?

I'm guessing if this happens then there's going to be a wave of repressions, especially towards political prisoners, but even if so I don't think the current regime is going to last very long. Lukashenko's position has become too weak.

&gt;And is there an actual fear of being annexed by Russia?

I don't think it's a possibility really, Crimea got annexed in part because it is historical Russian territory that was gifted to Ukraine during the USSR times + it had a very sizeable Russian population who obviously wanted to rejoin Russia. No such situation in Belarus, there's almost no Russians there and people generally want to be independent.

5621,"[good article](http://archiwum.thenews.pl/1/10/Artykul/317562,How-judges-are-selected-across-Europe) 

Edit:  
Correction to your chart:  
Current:  
Legislature&gt;minority NCJ  

Judges&gt;Majority NCJ

&gt; The KRS is composed of 25 members. Under the current law, these are the first president of the Supreme Court; the president of the Supreme Administrative Court; the justice minister, a member selected by the Polish president; four members selected by the Sejm lower house of parliament from among the house’s deputies; two members selected by the Senate, the upper house of parliament, from among senators; and 15 members selected by judges (two from the Supreme Court, two from appeals courts, two from administrative courts, eight from regional courts, and one from a military court).

Edit end

So I dispute the very easily part of this. In comparison to the PiS introduced system there would be less corruption.  
      Judges appointing other judges know about what they are looking for. Their incentives to be corrupt would be few since they become judges by being approved by the NCJ. This council is led by judges. There were already politicians in it, but they weren’t the majority so they played an advisory role. Because the judges don’t undergo elections they get to their positions because of their skills as judges. A good judge wouldn’t be corrupt, also evidenced by the lack of any media coverage of corruption scandals involving judges compared to the very much existing media coverage of politicians being corrupt(just saying media coverage because its like a measure of importance). A politician on the other hand inherently will seek to push his or his party’s goals. The idea of democracy is to separate these goals from impacting the judiciary because that would hinder its ability to control the legislature.",Lower Silesia (Poland),/r/europe/comments/i70hm8/warsaw_palace_of_culture_science_illuminated_in/g10qy19/,david220403,1597085307

The sites divided into subreddits which are a great medium for discussing specific topics/hobbies. It really excels at that better than any facebook or instagram page.

I think you have good idea but I am not sure that would work because private media are also untrustworthy, for example Andrzej Wajda, during the presentation of the honorary committee candidate for president Bronisław Komorowski, said: ""We have friends on TVN , we are also supported by the second private television.""(most likely polsat)

also Szymon Majewski, a satirist appearing on TVN, was fired from the station. As stated later in an interview for ""Wprost"", TVN programming director Edward Miszczak - Szymon Majewski was fired because ""he wanted to laugh not only at the terrible duck)(Kaczor) , but also at the PO"": 
""These are the laws of the market: all who fail fly out. It worked when emotions lay in the streets. But the lemmings do not want special laughs at the Civic Platform.""

Its pretty worrying how TVN which is viewed by polish people(including me until recently) as most trustworthy is so biased politically.

In a way only now that TVP is under PiS control we have media plurality, which is pretty screwed up, I hate what Kurski did with public media but I also want plurality in our media.

one thing that happen under PO that I find very suspicious was how The Office of Competition and Consumer Protection has agreed to let Polskapresse  buy Regional Media belonging to the British Mecom concern all its local newspapers, weeklies and internet portals.

5701,"It’s difficult…

&gt;	Contrary to the widespread assumption, there is no longer a nationwide uniform statutory midday rest in Germany. The noise ordinances that existed in the past in some federal states have been repealed, and in some they still exist. In the state of Bremen, for example, the Bremen Law on Protection against Harmful Environmental Impacts continues to apply. There, § 3a ""Operation of equipment and machinery"" specifies what is not permitted during the midday rest period. At municipal level, especially in health resorts, a midday rest may still be prescribed. Under civil law, a midday rest can be regulated e.g. in the house rules for rented and owner-occupied flats.

&gt;	Noise protection in Germany is regulated in different ordinances and guidelines depending on the type and polluter. These usually only have a particularly protective rest period on Sundays, which extends from 13 to 15 o'clock.

&gt;	According to the Technical Instructions on Noise Protection there are no separate assessment periods for the midday rest. On Sundays and public holidays, however, noise exposure during the midday rest period from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m., as well as in the morning (6 a.m. to 9 a.m.) and evening hours (8 p.m. to 10 p.m.), is assessed with a surcharge to take account of the increased need for rest. On weekdays (Monday to Saturday), there are corresponding surcharges only in the mornings and evenings (6 to 7 and 20 to 22), but not at lunchtime. Other regulations, such as the Sports Facilities Noise Protection Ordinance, have separate assessment periods for rest periods. However, here too, only on Sundays is there an entitlement to a midday rest period (1 to 3 p.m.) with a lower immission guide value (§ 2 para. 5 18. BImSchV).

&gt;	The Equipment and Machine Noise Protection Ordinance, on the other hand, generally prohibits the use of certain equipment outdoors between 1 p.m. and 3 p.m. (§ 7 para. 1 32. BImSchV).

&gt;	There are further regulations in state law, e.g. in Bavaria, lawnmowers may not be operated between 8 p.m. and 7 a.m. on weekdays in residential areas. On Sundays and public holidays, noise pollution is not allowed all day.

&gt;	There are exceptions, such as health resorts or bathing resorts. There, municipal ordinances can be issued which correspond to a midday rest and refer to the immission control ordinance. Violations can then be prosecuted by the responsible regulatory authorities as an administrative offence and punished by the imposition of a fine.

&gt;	In particularly narrow residential areas, terraced housing estates, housing estates with several flats or apartments, allotment garden associations as well as on the premises of hospitals or nursing homes, the respective regulations from the rental contract or the house rules apply. Such regulations may stipulate a midday rest, which is usually between 12 and 15 o'clock. However, this regulation then generally only applies to the residents. During this time, no noisy activities such as mowing the lawn or playing the piano, which could lead to a disturbance of the peace, are allowed.",Bavaria,/r/europe/comments/i72h6c/what_people_from_a_few_european_countries_ask/g10bpe7/,untergeher_muc,1597077968

The only difference between Artsakh and Kosovo is that Kosovo has better recognition. If Armenia will stop it's support, Artsakh will keep fighting until the last Armenian.
2. Again, Azerbaijan attacked Artsakh with an intention to ethnicaly cleanse it, Artsakh had a full right to defend itself
3. Again, it's a simple logic, there are no similarities between Crimea and Artsakh. If you did some research you would know that. I will suggest you to watch the joint Azerbaijani-Armenian documentary, it's called ""Parts of the Circle"".
4. So you are completely fine with Azerbaijan massacring Armenians, because it's Azerbaijan's business?  Gotcha. As I've already said, it's really easy to judge people when you sit in a warm place where you are provided with full rights and where your and your family's lives are not under constant threat of being killed.
5. Armenians are very united people and we will not sit and do nothing when our people are getting brutally killed, raped or expelled from their homeland. This whole war could be easily avoided if Azerbaijan didn't go full Milocevic.

I wonder, do you seriously think that if Azerbaijan will have Artsakh Armenians will have full rights and will not be killed or expelled? Do you seriously think that Armenians will be able to live peacefully in a country who president uses ""Armenian"" as an insult, whose official policy is Armenophobia, where Armenian historical monuments and buildings are getting demolished in an attempt to erase Armenians from history, whose national hero is Ramil Safarov, the guy who killed a sleeping Armenian with an axe, and where Armenian ethnicity is officially BANNED ( you read that right).

5816,"Well. I get where you stand so I'll try my best.

Those stereotypes you mentioned about Finns and Brits indeed do exist. Perhaps not without a reason. I would believe most Finns do indeed like sauna. The thing is - I don't believe most Russians want dictatorship to have a free reign everywhere and/or have some kind of malicious intent towards everyone(as implied by your words).

I believe that historically, for many reasons, it was harder for common people in Russia to fight for their rights vs elites than, say, in western Europe. I could discuss many reasons for this, but I'll leave it for another topic.

Basically what I mean is that it takes more effort here to change something for the better. Elites here have (and always had) more power to ignore people's will. Stagnation leads to radicalization. So moderate and weighted decisions are becoming less popular and radicals and populists come to the fore. And among those people - there are many more people acting with a bad faith. So basically it takes some radical effort to change something, and when a change finally occur - it often turns into a chaos. 

In times of chaos when standards of living are drastically reduced and even some basic needs are not satisfied anymore  - leaders that offer stability (=basic needs satisfaction) at the expense of freedom and extra needs - gain popularity. People are willing to give them more power that they will eventually abuse... ignoring people's will all over again.  

&amp;#x200B;

And it's very hard to escape this self-replicating system

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for a wall of text, but I'm just very sad when people imply that we're some kind of barbaric evil people, when in reality, based on my experience - there are so many different kind of people - bad and good, including many kind, open minded and loving people.

There is no one army per se, just because the command is centralised and/or works in unison/integrated, that doesn't make it is necessarily inherently a single army - and I am not only talking about the official existence of the NKR army distinguished officially from the Republic of Armenia army, but the fact that almost every single able-bodied man in Nagorno Karabakh is a volunteer soldier, consider that these people which could have fled as refugees like others to Russia, Europe or the US have remained there *out of conviction* and act upon said conviction when the requirement arises. They are people of generations old who have called that place home. These are not the army of the Republic of Armenia. Hell, the first instance of the use of Harop in the conflict was in 2016 when it hit a bus full of normal Karabakhi volunteers, not Armenian soldiers from Armenia ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2016/04/05/israeli-made-kamikaze-drone-spotted-in-nagorno-karabakh-conflict/ ), same with some of the drones shot were by Karabakhi people with hunting rifles in one case iirc. If one day Armenia stops supporting them they will keep on fighting all of them until they all get killed or they end up victorious. You have to consider that for the Armenian point of view this is an existential war, a conflict of survival. The same does not hold true for the opposing side.

5954,"There was 10000 people in multiple town living on the island in the 19th century. Today's population is lowest it has been in centuries. Definitely not founded because of the eez.

&gt;in many cases the islands that are so small amd so close to another country are not granted an EEZ, as it should be.

Limitations of EEZ rights of islands are usually made by signing treaties. e.g. italy and tunisia have a treaty that sets the eez to the middle and limits the effect of italian islands. And french islands in canadian coast have a reduced EEZ. Hoever most islands at the coastal areas do indeed have an eez. For example in the channel the british channel islands at the coast of france do extend UK eez. As do french islands near madagascar. And finnish islands that are neared to swedish coast. And various dutch islands at the coast of venezuela. And south korean islands near north korea. And whatever the canadian island is at the US border. Most of these islands aren't quite as near the coastline as kastellorizo but it wouldn't really make much difference for the borders if it was 20 km further in the sea. I found no cases where an inhabited island would not have an eez.

Adding to that there's a 5% points minimum you need to have to get your party into parliament. And 8% for coalitions.

in 2015 when PiS (the current ruling party) go their first majority win it was due to two parties getting 4% of votes. One coalition got 7%...so all of those votes were basically wasted. And that incuded the entire political left scene. 0 Seats. In those circumstances the largest party got even more of a bonus in seats.

So PiS got 37.5% of votes and 235 seats out 460. Which means yeah - the ruled solo. The 62.5% rest had 0 actual power or influence on politics. And 15% of voters didnt even get representation.
