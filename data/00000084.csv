For me, that's completely stupid to deny any kind of comparison. However in any case, the Holocaust would rank as one of the most if not the single most heinous of genocides.

Since then many large immigrant groups from different cultures arrived in the US, many without even being able to speak English and I don't see the same problems in these groups. Even recent immigrants from Africa and black Caribbeans are doing much better on average than African Americans.

Now, it's possible that we learned a little bit about slaves in the 5th to 9th grade, but I think children in elementary school aren't too young to learn about what the 1600s Portuguese were doing in the Atlantic, and it's likely just as important as knowing they bombed the hell out of India's Malabar Coast because they wouldn't sell us black pepper.

&gt;So please, link me the newest research! I would be glad to read it!

[Death in the soviet union.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excess_mortality_in_the_Soviet_Union_under_Joseph_Stalin)
At the bottom of the page you will find the newest, generaly accepted numbers, it states 2.5-4 million.

[holodomor article](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holodomor)
It states- ""According to the findings of the Court of Appeal of Kiev in 2010, the demographic losses due to the famine amounted to 10 million, with 3.9 million direct famine deaths, and a further 6.1 million birth deficits.""

And here is exactly what I'm talking about, the birth deficit is not and can not be counted into the deaths, because it is not deaths that occured, it is lack of births.

I have provided you with this matterial, and it's enough to show my point. You are not actually reading what I am saying, your lack of understanding of it all shows this.

Baby steps here.
[birth](https://www.google.com/amp/s/dictionary.cambridge.org/amp/english/birth)
[deficit](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/amp/english/deficit)

And now lets combine the two, birth+deficit- a birth deficit is a lesser amount of births than expected on the basis of periodical birth rate.
They were NOT born, so you can't count them as dead. How can you count as dead someone who has never been born?

72,"You cannot say the same about me. I wasn't conditioned by vegans or television or activists. I've changed because of the information I've got, out of what I've been conditioned my whole life. And those information where scientific facts, books about health and the environment.  For me this whole topic is an educational issue. It begins with ""we are supposed to eat meat"" and ""it's our nature"". We're much closer to herbivores then to carnivores. Our teeth and our inner system are made for plants. You cannot eat raw meat like animals. You have to cook it. And while this was a good advantage back in the days, it's completely unnecessary nowadays, where we know a lot about nutrition and health. 

Kids are against slaughter in 99% of the cases and this has nothing to do with Disney. Most humans today would have big problems with killing an animal and would be traumatized in most cases. Just because you can get used to it doesn't mean it's ok. You can get used to almost everything.

Your example is showing, that people have no idea what they are talking about and in this case I agree with you. In nature animals kill each other if they need to do it for food. So why would anyone be mad that those lions killed the giraffe. Even if we put it in the same place on purpose. Isn't it absurd how we say this is cruelty when the only difference to nature was that we spend time with the giraffe and tryed to make it as comfortable for it as we could?
It's quite similar to the pet-argument. Would you punch a dog? Would other people stop you from. doing so? If yes, then why do we make a line and say that these are pets and these are foods?
If you can get emotionally connected with a dog so that you'd never consider to eat it in normal circumstances, why do you think it's ok to kill a pig which is just as smart. I mean, I could rais dogs just to kill them. 

I say that people would instantly go vegan if they would know as much as I know about this topic after like three years of going deeper in that. They just don't because of convenience and the conditioning by the industry. We rather think about meat as the BBQ with our best friends and that milk gives us strong bones, while the truth is that meat gives us the most common diseases in the western world and animals are exploited on such a big scale, that we shouldn't even stay vegetarian and consume eggs and milk.

124,"I can see where you come from and I think to just make fun about your argument isn’t helping, because it’s one many people make. So let’s talk about it in all seriousness. 

You’re correct in the way you talk about learning history. We shouldn’t erase it, but we should learn from it. Now there’s the problem that statues don’t tell you anything on their own. If you don’t know who Leopold II. is already, this statue isn’t doing anything for you. Sometimes the name is engraved, but even then it’s onto you to take up a book and read about his deeds. If we’re honest, we both know that there are way more effective ways to bring people to read about something then putting up a statue. 

That being said there can be statues that are a constant reminder of things, good or bad and those do fulfil a purpose. Two examples are the Holocaust monument in Berlin, not a statue per se, but an incredible monument to remind everyone about the lessons learned and the colossal statue of Bavaria including the busts of important people in Munich; a reminder of how far Bavaria has come and a sign of friendship between the southern and northern part of Bavaria. King Leopolds statue though isn’t showing any of his deeds. We don’t see him cutting people’s hands off and commit something that could be described as genocide, the most famous mistake he made (that’s a bit of an understatement) that you surely eluded to previously, but we see him towering above his people, larger then live, sitting majestically on a horse to overlook his people. This is the depiction of a hero, but I don’t really get wich one of his mistakes is remembered this way. We’re not even remembering any of his good qualities this way, do we? No, we just glorify the man; a man who probably shouldn’t be glorified. 

Let’s talk about censorship. Working with history myself, I can assure you that censorship in Europe is getting better. Not just does the state not censor anything, but you can discuss and write about more varied topics nowadays and be taken seriously. Decades ago writing about a king critically that wasn’t dead since a long time, or seen as a tyrant was socially unacceptable, just as work revolving around the experience of the colonised, not the coloniser wasn’t getting you to far in some places. This has changed, history became a lot more political neutral and those topics can be discussed; they even manage to start a public debate. The removal of this statue is possible, because of more acceptance a d less censorship on the field of history nowadays. 

All of this though isn’t enough to get rid of a statue, it has to celebrate something negative to be removed more often then not. Statues aren’t free, are they? Taxpayers money is used for purposes like this, but not just that, it’s also a part of the city itself is standing in. Belgium has a great population of Congolese people, a people that pays taxes to celebrate the murderer of their ancestors and see the attempt to make them not more then slaves portrayed in a pretty positive light? That’s not the statue itself, it’s the context, but context matters. Would you built a statue of Bismarck in Germany? Probably, no problem there. Would you do the same in Poland? I think we all can agree on, no. That’s context. If the people of this local community want to get rid of it, there shouldn’t be anyone to stop them, because it’s them who live with it everyday. 

Last but not least it’s important to remind us that removing statues is a controversial thing, but a political neutral one. Throughout the eastern bloc statues of Stalin and Lenin were destroyed because conservatives and liberals thought it best. We haven’t forgotten the history, but a several meters high Lenin in Berlin to remind all of the people of the former GDR of the time they weren’t free? Obviously communists demonstrated, but in Hinsicht I think it was right to do it. The same goes for the Holocaust monument in Berlin that right-wingers describe as a „monument of shame“. It’s a popular opinion in certain circles to get rid of it. So we see that destroying statues is controversial and always a balancing act. Once again, I can see where you come from and there are sometimes good arguments in favour of letting statues stay where they are, but reminding us about history is more often then not not one of them and neither is forcing a decision onto a local people.",,/r/europe/comments/hj3fya/belgium_removes_statue_of_king_responsible_for/fwkem6b/,Linus_Al,1593594069

Now, while worldwide Jews -- as a religion -- have *very* diverse phenotypes, think e.g. of the black Jews of Ethiopia, within each region/country which is not a typical immigration country (unlike the US or Israel) they were in fact noticably homogenous, exactly because their religion promotes endogamous relationships, ie. marrying outside of the community is frowned upon or even forbidden by religious laws. Even in more open communities which would allow marrying outside of the community (if the groom would convert), in the context of 19th and 20th century Europe this wouldn't noticably dilute the genetics, because such converts were very rare due to widespread antisemitism: even if some Jewish communities would have accepted others, there were no candidates interested in such a course of action.

That means, that in a place with little recent Jewish immigration you indeed had a median Jewish face that was distinct from the median local face.

205,"&gt;Costantine was a pretty good emperor, actually. He unified the empire after the failure of tretrarchy and gave the empire a few extra decades by promoting christianity in 313 and 325. In 330 he founded Costantinople as the new head of the Empire.

I am skeptical of ""stabilizing emperors"" because it almost always seems to be a case of making politically short-term decisions with long term negative consequences.    

&gt;He surely didn't plan to promote religious tolerance, but to make political use of that new monotheism that prayed one god and had one man to raprisent him on the world.

A smart man would have realized he was sold a crock of shit the moment the Arian and Melitian issues came to ahead during the Nicean council.

The ingrained intolerance of the Christian sects would lead to neverending schismatic rebellions in both the Eastern and Western sections, and would serve to permenantly divide the sections of the Roman Empire from each other with the Great Schism.

Hell, the eventual undoing of his Eastern Empire was started with the ""Massacre of the Latins"" and the Fourth Crusade.

&gt;Also, Costantine ruled during the Dominatus, which means Rome is an actual autocracy and the Senate already gave up on its political influence, but saying that this is since Augustus, I think, is wrong.

Augustus by the end of his life was already trying to pass some responsability of managing the empire back to the Senate with marginal success since the culture of senatorial sinecure was already established.

209,"Thank you, Russians don't really hate anyone either, but considering all the shit that's been thrown our way for the past 12 years, it really is getting old. There's a lot you can criticise Russia for, but honestly, as a Russian who has been following the news for the past 12 years, most of them have been either exaggerations or outright lies.

As to your points, Russia does not ban BBC, CNN, FOX, or any other western media that constantly criticises Russia. But Latvia banned RT. So it's clear who is being more restrictive to foreign press.

What Russia does is that it assimilates others' culture. Look at Russian food, music, even language. It incorporates other cultures, but it takes on parts of those cultures and makes it Russian too. That's how you successfully live with other cultures, you adopt their culture and encourage them to adopt yours. If you fail to do that, you get what's happening in the west today with all the racial and cultural violence.

I never heard about that anchor, but it seems she said something like ""Jewish organisations through their actions brought holocaust closer"", which is a stupid thing to say, and it seems it happened in 2014 and she was criticised heavily for it, there were petitions to have her fired etc. Certainly isn't a mainstream position in Russia, and I blame her stupidity rather than any official message.

What Putin said is ""How do you know they are Russian, they could be Ukrainian, Tatar, Jewish people who live in Russia."" He is just listing random nationalities which are numerous in Russia, he is not blaming Jews for anything lol. This is a good example of western media manipulating Russian news and reporting fake news.

Yes, Russia had its own traitors too, but they were hung after the war, not celebrated, I think this is an important difference.

LGBT culture isn't celebrated in Russia as Russians are more conservative, especially Muslim Russians. But they do have the same rights as other people and it's illegal to discriminate against them. With Chechnya, they are de facto independent and live under Sharia law, so there is nothing Russia can do about that.

Russia supports socialist parties as well, it supports anyone who is against the western establishment. It's not an ideological support, merely a geopolitical one.

United Russia runs on a multicultural platform, they promote all Russian cultures, that's why the nationalists were their main opposition for a while during 2000-2007.

Nashi is mostly young adults, not children, and they mostly do social projects, not political ones. They also don't really follow any ideology. Hardly anything like Hitler youth. They also don't exist anymore IIRC.

Russia doesn't deny the famine, it's just that there is no historic consensus of whether there were deliberate steps to make the famine worse. It can't be a genocide of Ukrainians by definition, as more Kazakhs died as a proportion, and a lot of Russians too, everyone who lived in the geographical area. If it was made worse on purpose, it was likely more aimed at a social class of people rather than a national group. So you would have to have a very loose definition of genocide to call it that, but you can try argue that. In any case, the famine is not denied and Stalin's crimes have been condemned numerous times both by USSR and Russian Federation.",Russia,/r/europe/comments/hiqwrz/latvia_bans_rt/fwk79xi/,WeAreBRICS,1593586775

378,"The supposed premise is all lives matter. The system in the US however, has, and continues to behave as if black lives do not (From slavery, jim crow, lynchings, redlining, police brutality, reduced opportunities and aid, etc..). Therefore it needs to be said and reiterated that black lives do matter. The system created the categorisation and problem for black people, and therefore you can't just ignore it and move on, since the consequences are still real. 

Ultimately the goal is for the premise that all lives matter be internalised and accepted by the system and everyone in it, but until then this issue needs to be addressed, and unfortunately you have to engage it in the same (wrong) terms that the problem created. It's a temporary step, and I agree it can be problematic since it's not the end goal, but it's a necessary step. 

However, this is an american problem, created by american history. Europe does of course have racism, but its roots and effects are not the same and cannot be addressed in the same way. 

And no, there aren't human races. There are people with different appearances but, their appearance has absolutely no bearing on who they are intrinsically.

What are the elements of one or the other races that I are within me? What parts of me are this race, what parts are the other? It doesn't make any sense.

533,"&gt; Neuman Tczew. Lubnauer A lot of celebs supporting PO

Said politicians, not celebs.

But OK, Neumann was a fail indeed. And it didn't help his career. Lubnauer is not from PO, just a leader of remnant of .N.

At the same time, there are multiple quotes from PiS politicians derogatory towards anti-PiS voters. And usually these are **not punished** or criticized (internally), at all. Kaczyński or Terlecki can say worst things, and nothing will happen. But God forbid minor PO politician to say something even barely derogatory, even in private. And notice, Neumann's remark was private.

Which actually leads to interesting notice: according to some research, PiS voters (not politicians!) actually are at the same time less negative towards other ones, and feel less attacked by them. While anti-PiS voters feel more attacked, but at the same time tend to ""fight back"" more.

So in the end, you have clear line of hate: PiS politicians (and media) &gt; anti-PiS voters (and media) &gt; PiS voters &gt; anti-PiS politicians

1. Media of both sides can be hateful, albeit PiS ones overall are worse.

2. PiS politicians are much more hateful, than anti-PiS ones.

3. But! Anti-PiS voters are more hateful, than PiS ones.

Overall, PiS simply mastered hate and fear-mongering, provoking their opponents to blind attacks.",Pomorze-𝔓𝔬𝔪𝔪𝔢𝔯𝔢𝔩𝔩𝔢𝔫-Pòmòrskô,/r/europe/comments/hh0yba/polish_presidential_election_megathread_1st_turn/fwjd442/,pothkan,1593565756

651,"&gt;when there is no European people. You need generations of intermarriage, cultural exchange and soft union to engender this “demos”. You need a common language, you need a common belief system or religion (atheism?) and a common history that only comes with time.

I disagree with this sentiment. There really isn't an ""American"" people either. If you go up to almost any American and ask them what they are, they'll probably list off where their ancestors came from. This is partly because a very large part of the country's population are first or second generation immigrants, and only Native Americans, who are a small part of the American population, come from families that have lived here for more than a few generations.

There isn't really a predominant culture (most first and second gen immigrants practice their native holidays) nor is there a predominant religion. The closet thing to a unified aspect of our country would probably be the English language, and even that isn't universal as there is a large population in the south that doesn't speak English, only Spanish.

I think people who spout the whole need for cultural exchange are just staunch nationalists. If you come to the US sometime and travel to the different parts of it, I think you'll find that people of all different backgrounds, cultures, religions, and even languages can get along united under a single flag just fine.",,/r/europe/comments/himpcx/the_united_states_of_europe_could_be_the_social/fwj07xx/,BombTime1010,1593558359

It's a joke. 

&gt; What would Ireland use a large military for

Well first of all, we're not talking about a sizable military force to begin with. They're mulling the purchase of just a handful of planes here. Nothing too fancy or over the top. 

Secondly, 'the military' is misunderstood. Why does Germany, for instance, have a military? It's not as though someone's going to attack us anytime soon, and even if somebody tried to, they'd first have to cross the territory of any number of our neighbours to even make it to our borders proper. All you need to defend Germany in its current geopolitical setup is a few coastal batteries, a few missiles and maybe 10 planes. And since no major power could possibly allow the centre of Europe to fall prey to another major power, they'd defend Germany in any case. For all practical matters and purposes, Germany could disband its military alltogether without endangering its security. 

So why *do* we have a military ? Certainly not for security reasons (quite the opposite in fact; because wars usually follow soldiers, not the other way round). We have a military because we want to *wield influence*.

They base this belief on the fact they themselves are gay (as often is revealed later) and they believe their own attraction to the same sex is how everyone feels and the only way to prevent people from acting on it is to make it illegal.

In the same sense you clearly have no discipline and your belief that the only thing that prevents people from becoming alcoholics is SB says more about you than it does anyone else.

870,"&gt;Sure it will, one just needs to look how big of a progress has been made towards it in the past 10 years

The irony is that you meant this sarcastically, but it is absolutely true. Ten years ago we didn't have an ESM, a Banking Union, a European Prosecutor, an agreement in principle for a Eurozone budget and another one for a EU army, a powerful Frontex, a highly political Commission in contrast to the normal technocratic one, the start of debt mutualization and of a Fiscal union and probably transnational voting lists for the next EU elections. There's been MASSIVE progress towards federalization, especially after the UK voted for Brexit and stopped vetoeing all further integration. Poland and Hungary's populist opposition will be crippled when the EU decides to link EU funds to rule of law, which is happening literally right now as we speak. The Frugal countries stand to lose a lot more if they don't agree with the recovery plan - not tens of billions, but in the hundreds of billions. So, yeah, it's kinda going one way and it's speeding up. Pay more attention and be less sarcastic.

No. Montenegro is the only country close to joining. Serbia has been going in the opposite direction for the last 5 years, similar to Turkey.

Doesn't mean we have to go around the world trying to impose our values onto others.

&gt;But I really gotta say as an Australian it's quite soured my opinion on European governments to see them so focused on economic deals with China even as the nation conducts a genocide.

At which point in time did major world powers care about genocides? On a geopolitical level, genocides just serve as an excuse to take actions against countries you wanted to take actions against anyways. There have been tons of genocides -- even in modern times -- that have been overlooked or even supported by our governments if the country committing the genocide was ""on our side"". Saudi Arabia and their genocide in Yemen springs to mind. Or the genocide in East Timor, conducted by the Indonesians with full support of the US.

998,"&gt; The three-week period of relatively stable death numbers doesn't align with a three-week period of stable ICU admissions.

I don't understand what you mean here. The deaths, as well as numbers in ICU have been declining the whole time. Slowly, sure, but during the period 18 May - 18 June, daily deaths more than halved, and ICU numbers almost halved.

What do you mean by historical prediction trend line? I can't see that in the graph.

What I meant was that the grain of salt should be taken when relying on models. Models are useful, but there is a difference between models and reality. I just don't think it is reasonable to assume that there is currently a large spike of deaths without some very good evidence, since all other statistics point downward. And I don't see the point of guessing either. Just wait a week and see what the actual numbers were. We are not in a hurry.

FoHM stopped reporting on weekends starting a few weeks ago (last week maybe? I can't really remember). As well as seemingly changing which days they do the checks against death-registers (I can't find where I read this, so it might not be true.) According to the person who made the model, there might also be some issues with the prediction. But he didn't elaborate much so I don't really know what is going on (I read it on twitter a couple of days ago, you could probably find it there as well).

I checked the proportionality constant, but it doesn't seem to have changed much (at least by my calculations). It changed a bit. But why would you even expect it to be exactly the same? And why is it so concerning that it differs slightly? Deaths mostly occur among elderly, who are often too frail to be admitted to an ICU. The demographics of those who die and those who are in ICU should therefore be different.

I really don't see why you think this is such a large problem. Do you think there is some foul play going on? Some error in the ICU-registers? What is really your concern here?",,/r/europe/comments/hg68na/swedish_state_epidemiologist_calls_whos_inclusion/fwhrpp3/,ynfnehf,1593537006

&gt; Are you painfully ignorant or actually just stupid? The ICC borrows, builds and extends to all these Conventions, it's a court, not a written codex. It's clearly you who doesn't have a fucking clue about anything you're talking about. The very first statement you made was there are no international courts and yet we're constantly talking about the ICC.

Here is my reply

I said there are no international courts that have jurisdiction extending back that far. 

&gt; The ICC borrows, builds and extends to all these Conventions, it's a court, not a written codex.

Unfortunately you couldn't be more wrong.

While the ICC works with the UN and refers to conventions such as the Geneva Convention in the Rome Statute, UN resolutions and conventions have absolutely no impact on the ICC's jurisdiction. The ICC is bound by the Rome Statute and governed the Assembly of State Parties, not by the UN General Assembly. 


The ICC is unfortunately an incredibly constrained institution, which is why only some 40 odd people have been indicted throughout it's 18 year history - despite the vast number of crimes being committed across the globe that fall under it's jurisdiction.



Anyhow - the original discussion was about whether the ICC has jurisdiction over the Belgian crimes in the Congo. 

The answer is no. 

Even if the answer was yes, the ICC prosecutes *individuals* not Governments and so it is a moot point regardless.",Death From Above,/r/europe/comments/hihf8l/belgium_makes_formal_apology_to_congo_for/fwhbmmb/,surprisedropbears,1593529257

The inability to understand that attacking neutral countries will give the USA an official reason to fully enter ww1 and the inability to understand that they don't really have anything to tame Hitler with. The inability to see that a man who tried to march on Berlin to overthrow the government is not a dog whose bark is worse than his bite, but in fact bites much worse than he barks.

1190,"The latest findings on race, genes and intelligence show that the gap in intelligence between Europeans and Africans is caused partly by irreducible genetic factors. These findings conclusively put an end to the theory that the gap is caused solely by socio-economic factors.

The following genes are present in at least one third of the European population and are known to increase intelligence with genome-wide levels of significance:

SNP Distribution

rs708913 (A) Europeans are 341% more likely to have this gene than Africans

rs1044258 (T) Europeans are 470% more likely to have this gene than Africans

rs1487441 (A) Europeans are 156% more likely to have this gene than Africans

rs1800668 (A) Europeans are 59% more likely to have this gene than Africans

rs2099744 (A) Europeans are 123% more likely to have this gene than Africans

rs2364543 (T) Europeans are 113% more likely to have this gene than Africans

rs2899319 (A) Europeans are 214% more likely to have this gene than Africans

rs4314918 (A) Europeans are 337% more likely to have this gene than Africans

rs6535809 (A) Europeans are 650% more likely to have this gene than Africans

rs6546856 (T) Europeans are 418% more likely to have this gene than Africans

rs7963801 (T) Europeans are 2985% more likely to have this gene than Africans

rs9388490 (T) Europeans are 121% more likely to have this gene than Africans

rs11793831 (T) Europeans are 350% more likely to have this gene than Africans

rs13428598 (T) Europeans are 417% more likely to have this gene than Africans

rs17048855 (A) Europeans are 595% more likely to have this gene than Africans

The following genes are present in at least one third of the African population and are known to decrease intelligence with genome-wide levels of significance:

SNP Distribution

rs1245213 (A) Africans are 233% more likely to have this gene than Europeans

rs1346075 (T) Africans are 65% more likely to have this gene than Europeans

rs1972863 (A) Africans are 126% more likely to have this gene than Europeans

rs2416114 (T) Africans are 91% more likely to have this gene than Europeans

rs2420551 (A) Africans are 399% more likely to have this gene than Europeans

rs4325706 (T) Africans are 81% more likely to have this gene than Europeans

rs4640173 (A) Africans are 118% more likely to have this gene than Europeans

rs6736129 (A) Africans are 163% more likely to have this gene than Europeans

rs7019796 (T) Africans are 134% more likely to have this gene than Europeans

rs8138473 (T) Africans are 103% more likely to have this gene than Europeans

rs9755750 (A) Africans are 162% more likely to have this gene than Europeans

rs9939991 (A) Africans are 135% more likely to have this gene than Europeans

Key points:

• These genes are known to influence mainly the hippocampus, brain, limbic system, central nervous system, cerebral cortex, cerebrum, parahippocampal gyrus, telencephalon, temporal lobe, brain stem, prosencephalon, rhombencephalon, occipital lobe, cerebellum, visual cortex, parietal lobe, retina, basal ganglia, neural stem cells, corpus striatum and frontal lobe.

• These genes alone account already for roughly two thirds of one standard deviation in cognitive ability.

• These genes are at least 50% more likely to exist in one population than in the other, can be found in at least one third of either population, and positively affect Europeans or negatively affect Africans. More than 200 genes that meet these requirements can be conservatively estimated to exist.

• The differences between populations might be even larger since the African sample included cohorts with European admixture.

1259,"&gt; Yeah, you probably afford to buy it no matter how the prices will look like, so why bother about the majority of people?

You clearly have no idea how international trade actually works. 

Firstly, the importing country sets the tariffs; if prices go up, it will be largely determined by what tariffs *the UK government sets*. On WTO terms, average tariffs on food are around 20% under EU's MFN. Even if the UK kept the EU tariffs (and they are not obliged to do so), do you really think people are going to be terribly affected if their Spanish chorizo now costs £2.40 rather than £2? 

Second, prices are always going up and down simply due to fluctuations in the exchange rate. After GBP lost 20% following the referendum, the cost of importing products from the EU went up by roughly 20%, and yet *consumption rose*. No one really noticed it.

Thirdly, the effect on prices is a one off; if the UK govt puts tarrifs on EU food products then there is a one-off price increase next year and then they are stable (insofar as other factors don't change, e.g. fx rates, supply and demand). 

&gt; Germany is superior to UK in living standards because they have less bullshit services like the ones you are probably working for in the UK. But you are too egocentric to be able to deny your self-importance and even think about it.

Lol, it has very little to do with their manufacturing and services balance, and nearly everything to do with culture. Living standards are an awfully nebulous concept, but I can give you rankings that have the Netherlands comfortably ahead of Germany despite the fact that they have a services sector as large as the UKs. 

&gt; Also, Italy has better life expectancy than UK, although they don't have most of the bullshit services in the UK. And France too.

Why are you bringing life expectancy into this? I believe that good Italian life expectancy is linked to their diet, not the type of economy. France has higher life expectancy than the UK and a proportionality higher services sector. 

Honestly, this is probably the dumbest thing you've said so far (that size of services sector is inversely correlated with life expectancy, loooooooool)

&gt; The flow will not be the same.

Did I say that it would be the *same*??? No, but it's not going to significantly change. Long term it may, but these things are always dynamic and the share of UK imports from the EU has been declining for over a decade. 

&gt;  Also, financial services transactions will not be the same.

No one is saying that it will be exactly the same. But it isn't going to massively change in the space of a year. And there will definitely be an agreement on financial services, it is just as much of a threat to EU economies as it is to the UK one. London is an integral part of the eurozone financial system. 

&gt; Yeah, of course, anyone disagreeing with your neoliberal agenda is economically clueless.

My neoliberal agenda??? Nah fam, I'm just taking issue with the economic illiteracy you are spewing here with your bizarre idea that manufacturing is the be all and end all of economic prosperity (a demonstrably ridiculous proposition).

1261,"&gt;Amazing username btw, just noticed it lol.

Thanks. I picked it after I saw a BBC documentary on Genghis Khan about 15 years ago. It was taken the first time I used it, so being a Nintendo fanboy I attached 64.

&gt;I'm single but Temujin (Timuçin in Turkish) is what I've thought of naming a future son, and I will surely teach him the wonders of retro gaming including N64 :)

If we have a son I want to call him Keito. It's a relatively common Japanese name and it meets my criteria for being hard for English speakers to mispronounce (must not have the letter r; must have two syllables or else English speakers will erroneously add emphasis to the first or middle syllable). However, in Latin characters I'll spell it Cato, like the Roman senator. His middle name will be Fionn after my favourite Irish legend, Fionn mac Cumhaill.

&gt;Also Welsh people makes me think of black hair/brunettes. I don't know, maybe that's just me projecting stereotypes based on popular Welsh celebs.

You're not wrong there. Dark hair is a common phenotype for the Welsh. It's also quite common in Ireland too. I have pale skin and blue eyes but dark brown hair. It's common enough in Ireland that the Americans have a term for it, [black Irish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_people#Black_Irish).

When you think about Irish celebrities, you see that dark hair is by far the most dominant hair colour. Colin Farrell, Cillian Murphy, Pierce Brosnan, Liam Neeson, Graham Norton, Bono, Robert Sheehan, Dolores O'Riordan, Shane MacGowan, Chris O’Dowd, Ciarán Hinds, Stephen Rea, Dylan Moran, Aidan Gillen, Gabriel Byrne, Johnathon Rhys Meyers, Andrew Scott, etc. They're all dark haired.

I can only think of a few red haired Irish celebrities. Conor McGreggor, Brendan Gleason and his sons. They're the only ones who come to mind.",Ireland,/r/europe/comments/hiid6b/sketches_used_by_the_police_in_the_ussr_to/fwgpj46/,temujin64,1593514881

So what we could do is very simple. Make it a rule that countries can subsidize their farmers up to the limits set in the CAP, but they pay for it themselves. then you avoid distorting the level playing field too much, you don't get a race to subsidize your farmers too much, but any subsidies given to farmers must be paid for by the country itself.

1639,"&gt; Tory MP and ERG chairman Mark Francois wrote to Barnier demanding he listens to Boris Johnson’s negotiators and finds a compromise on contentious trading points quickly.
&gt; 
&gt; In the letter, which he describes as a ‘missive from a free country’, Francois says the UK has no intention of accepting EU proposals on fisheries policy, or the level playing field.
&gt; 
&gt; “I refer you to the Conservative Party’s 2019 Manifesto - which I and all my colleagues stood on late last year - which made clear to the British people that we would have ‘a new relationship based on free trade and friendly cooperation, not on the EU’s Treaties or EU laws’,” he wrote.

&gt; https://twitter.com/andreajenkyns/status/1277613712292155393

&gt; “In the spirit of honesty between friends,” he added, “there can be no way that the European Court of Justice can be allowed to have any role in the UK’s national life after the end of this year.”
&gt; 
&gt; He then accused the EU of being an ‘undemocratic’ institution, before stating that Britain would soon be “a fully independent country at the end of this year, responsible for its own destiny”.
&gt; 
&gt; “All I and my colleagues in the ERG have ever really wanted, is to live in a free country... We have come a very long way in securing this objective and we have no intention of abandoning it.”
&gt; 
&gt; The letter was posted by Andrea Jenkyns, a Tory MP and the deputy chairwoman of the ERG parliamentary group, on her Twitter account. It was quickly derided by those at the tweet was shared by others.
&gt; 
&gt; John Rain pointed out the irony in Francois’ statement. “So he’s cool with Cummings, the unelected man, running things?” he wrote.
&gt; 
&gt; Damon Evans tried to image Barnier’s reaction: “Barnier: ‘Who is Mark Francois?’ ‘Have you ever seen The Hobbit?...’”
&gt; 
&gt; Composer Miffy Buckley replied: “Did Mark’s mum write it for him, bearing in mind he’s still at the potato printing, Crayola-munching stage?”
&gt; 
&gt; Remainiacs’ Ian Dunt posted: “The last par is so staggeringly insane. I blame the parents, of course. You shouldn’t let little boys watch war movies at too young an age”.

But in the US at least, lots of the policies about this are handled at the state level, so if the question that you care about is ""whose policies are doing well"" I think states, which are fairly big regions, would be the way to look at it.

1720,"It's... complicated, and it's one of the remnants from Yugoslav wars. Which is why uproar is only being raised when it comes to Croats from BiH voting, and not ones from the rest of the world.

A decent number of people was against having them vote even before this crisis hit, since most of them have never lived in Croatia and wil never live here. They don't pay taxes here, but their children are regularly packed off to our colleges for free etc. It's a shitshow of a situation that you can't solve in a proper way. A decent number of them has family that came to Croatia during the war as refugees. My own family on mother's side is from Bosnia, but once the war hit all of them came to Croatia because they consider themselves to be Croatian. Me and my counsins have only Croatian citizenship and we consider ourselves to only be Croat etc. And some of those cousins were born in BiH, spent first years of their life in Germany, and then came back to Croatia. To think of ourselves like that, and then not consider our cousins whose parent's have remained in Bosnia as Croats, despite all of them having same roots as us is... a bit disengenous. At the same time, anyone below the millenial generation was born in their own country (BiH) and instead of having that citizenship as their primary identity, a lot of them seem to identify more with Croatia or Serbia, depending on their religion and their parent's nationality. It's a shitshow all around, that's probably gonna be only solved once my generation, and then one coming after us dies off.",,/r/europe/comments/hhyr6e/croatian_hdz_government_to_remove_2_week/fwfg90k/,why_gaj,1593479421

1729,"Stuff like this used to happen with NASA contracts until like 10 years ago. Before they got sick of it. 

I think the main facts supporting SpaceX is that the US had the same problem as Europe does with Arianespace. Boeing and Lockheed Martin were 2 huge politically connected firms that had a monopoly on the US government launch industry, an American version of Arianespace. 

The main reason why SpaceX has credibility is because Elon Musk came out of nowhere and tore down the American version of ArianesSpace. Musk had to sue the US Air Force to force it to open up its contracts to allow SpaceX to bid on US military launches. 

The Boeing-ULA monopoly was even more corrupt and charged higher prices than Arianespace did. They had a captive audience because the US spends way more money on military launches so they had a much bigger taxpayer cow to milk. 

NASA was the first to support SpaceX precisely because they had a limited fixed budget so they were more pissed off at having to hire Boeing and Lockheed Martin. While the US military had an infinite budget and didn't care as much. It was only after SpaceX had been cheaply serving NASA effectively for years that it became politically embarrassing for the US military to keep on using Boeing and Lockheed and wasting taxpayer money.",,/r/europe/comments/hhwo4o/eu_will_speed_up_its_spaceflight_plans_in/fwfgunh/,JSanchez504,1593479773

1866,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture_in_Saudi_Arabia

Looks like large-scale irrigation work the government did.

&gt;In the past, the bulk of agricultural production was concentrated in a few limited areas. The produce was largely retained by these communities although some surplus was sold to the cities. Nomads played a crucial role in this regard, shipping foods and other goods between the widely dispersed agricultural areas. Livestock rearing was shared between the sedentary communities and nomads, who also used it to supplement their precarious livelihoods.[3]

-

&gt;Agriculture in Saudi Arabia is focused on the export of dates, dairy products, eggs, fish, poultry, fruits, vegetables, and flowers to markets around the world as it has achieved self-sufficiency in the production of such products.[1] The government of Saudi Arabia is heavily involved in the agriculture industry, and the ministry of agriculture (part of the Ministry of Environment, Water and Agriculture[2]) is primarily responsible for the agricultural policies in the nation. The private sector also plays a role in the nation's agriculture, as the government offers long-term interest-free loans and low-cost water, fuel, electricity, and duty-free imports of raw materials and machinery.
&gt;
&gt;Over the past decade, the agriculture of Saudi Arabia has drastically improved. Although Saudi Arabia is widely thought of as a desert, it has regions where the climate has favoured agriculture. Rain falls in winter every year in Saudi Arabia but with an average of maximum 100mm except in the Southern area of the country [2]. The government, in particular, has aided with this process by converting large areas of desert into agricultural fields.[1] By implementing major irrigation projects and adopting large-scale mechanization, this has progressed in developing agriculture in the country, adding previously barren areas to the stock of cultivatable land.[3] 

Though it looks like -- as in California -- it depends on drawing water from aquifers, so that won't be long-term sustainable.

&gt;Saudi Arabia is suffering from a major depletion of the water in its underground aquifers and a resultant break down and disintegration of its agriculture as a consequence.[8][9] As a result of the catastrophe, Saudi Arabia has bought agricultural land in the United States,[10][11][12][13] Argentina,[14] Indonesia, Thailand,[15] and Africa.[16][17][18] Saudi Arabia ranked as a major buyer of agricultural land in foreign countries.[19][20]

Let's say we all know that oranges are orange, and the dictionary definition of orange is ""orange tropical fruit with sweet or sour flavor"". Then one day, a farmer manages to breed a strain of orange that produces blue oranges. These oranges are identical to other oranges in structure, flavor, etc... except they're blue.

If we use your logic, these blue oranges aren't actually oranges, and we shouldn't call them oranges. Everyone knows oranges are orange, so clearly these can't be oranges.

In reality, the pragmatic thing to do is to acknowledge that our definition of orange is outdated, and we should change it to better describe what we understand by the *concept* of an orange.

And just like I described in the hypothetical - if we don't see a significant reason for why gay people shouldn't be allowed to marry, isn't altering the definition of marriage to include gay couples the pragmatic thing to do?",Czech Republic,/r/europe/comments/hi0znl/legalization_of_homosexual_marriage_in_europe/fwf3q42/,yawnston,1593472414

2006,"&gt; Introduction This study aimed to create a composite measure of a healthy lifestyle  for adolescents, and analyze its relationship to sociodemographic  factors.  Methods Data were from the Health Behavior in School‐Aged Children 2014  International survey. Participants were 167 021 adolescents (48.2% boys  and 51.8 girls), aged 10‐16 years, from 38 countries.  Results Five healthy behaviors used in this study included engaging in ≥60  minutes of physical activity every day, daily consumption of fruit and  vegetables, spending &lt;2 hours daily immersed in screen‐based  behaviors, and abstinence from alcohol as well as from tobacco products.  Only 1.9% (95% CI: 1.4%, 2.3%) of adolescents had a healthy lifestyle,  achieving all five healthy behaviors. In contrast, 4.2% (95% CI: 3.7%,  4.6%) reported none of the healthy behaviors.  Conclusions Despite the benefits of engaging in physical activity, engaging in low  levels of screen‐based activity, regular consumption of fruits and  vegetables, and abstaining from alcohol and cigarettes, only 2% of  adolescents could be classified as having a healthy lifestyle.",Sweden,/r/europe/comments/hi5mro/childrens_healthy_lifestyle/fwe8qaa/,weirdowerdo,1593457136

2030,"&gt;You can’t terraform Mars because it has no magnetosphere and the planet is too small to support it. Even if the atmosphere had 20% oxygen just like earth, the air would be too thin to breathe because the gravity is too weak on the surface.  
&gt;  
&gt;Even if Mars were large enough to support an atmosphere, the oxygen would just get stripped away by the solar wind because there is no magnetosphere. You can engineer a magnetosphere. It’s caused by the entire amount of magma in the earth’s core producing huge electrical currents on a planet wide scale. Mars’ core died 4 billion years ago.

Hmm, very interesting. Appreciate the insight. So sure, it wouldn't be Mars, but it well may be any potential planet - for the purpose of my arguement.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; If humans ever do find a way to travel at the speed of light then we still wouldn’t be able to colonize habitable worlds in other solar systems. The vast majority of potentially habitable planets are thousands of light years from earth. And SpaceX isn’t working on any type of technology that could ever do that. It’s developing old fashioned chemical rockets that can’t even leave the solar system.

According to the CDC, [""From April 12, 2009 to April 10, 2010, CDC estimated there were 60.8 million cases (range: 43.3-89.3 million), 274,304 hospitalizations (range: 195,086-402,719), and 12,469 deaths (range: 8868-18,306) in the United States due to the (H1N1)pdm09 virus.""](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/2009-h1n1-pandemic.html) So over the course of a calendar year, about 10% of the current number of deaths from Covid.

All of that said, it's not entirely fair to blame Trump for all of the deaths. As plenty of European countries have shown, it's not unavoidable, even if everyone pulls together and does their part. There were going to be deaths, and likely a decent sized number, because that's just what happens with a larger population.

What is 100% apt to be blamed on Trump is the absolutely terrible way he responded to it. To contrast the two, as mentioned in [this Snopes article about a popular bunch of bullshit regarding Obama's response to Swine Flu](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/obama-wait-swine-flu-n1h1/), Obama declared it a ""Public Health Emergency"" when the cases were only at 20 in the US, well before it was declared a pandemic. 

Trump on the other hand, said on 24/02/20 “The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA… Stock Market starting to look very good to me!”. This was around the time that other countries were reporting increasing cases, and the US itself was also seeing numbers start to increase.

On 02/03/20 he asked “You take a solid flu vaccine, you don't think that could have an impact, or much of an impact, on corona?” while seemingly unaware that the flu and Corona virus weren't the same...which was especially odd, since on the 6th he said “I like this stuff. I really get it. People are surprised that I understand it… Every one of these doctors said, ‘How do you know so much about this?’ Maybe I have a natural ability. Maybe I should have done that instead of running for president.”

Trump's handling of this has been top-to-bottom terrible. He spent the crucial first few months calling it a Democrat hoax and fake news meant to make him look bad, meaning a significant portion of the US population took him at his word, and proceeded to spend the next few months ignoring warnings, resisting the call to properly sanitize and wear protective things like face masks...all when he could have taken it seriously from the start, as it was obvious from how the rest of the world was being hit, that this wasn't just going to pass over the US.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/hhz434/europeans_trust_in_trumps_america_is_gone_after/fwe9ago/,aaronwhite1786,1593457401

- Solar cells
- Water purification
- Satellite navigation 
- Aquifer tracking
- Hurricane warning system
- Asteroid tracking/Planetary defense
- Climate Change Research

Why do you think anybody bothered to study whats going in the upper atmosphere in the first place? Space exploration is why we paid attention to the hole in the ozone layer and got satellite data of desertification, melting pole caps and lakes drying up. 

By looking at the runaway Greenhouse effect of Venus, the volcanism of IO or the Sandstorms at Mars etc we can learn about other planets atmospheres and the history of our solar system that ultimately helps us to understand what can happen to our own Earth and how we can prevent a path we don't desire.

Think about it this way: If we learn how to build an artificial eco system in space or how to terraform other planets we can apply this knowledge to our own world to fix the climate.

There are also myriads of other benefits like international cooperation on the ISS and the potential to unlock the vast resources of the asteroid belt.

2195,"FTA:

&gt;So this law in particular was enshrining what was a common elite practice in many Muslim societies. It seems crazy, given the Islamic world's reputation vis a vis homosexuality today, but the Islamic world has a long, long history with what you might call homonormativity. Using that term particularly is fraught, because historians working with gender argue that today's strict homosexual/heterosexual dichotomy, where you are either ""gay"" or ""straight,"" with no middle ground, is a construct emanating from mid 19th century Europe, and so using any of today's terms before that is dicey.

&gt;....In Persianate cultures, all of them Muslim, it was very common for older men to romantically pursue younger, beardless men. Once a teenager started to show traces of growing his beard (his ""khatt,"" or line), he generally moved to the ""older man"" category, stopped being pursued, and frequently became a pursuer. 

&gt;...This is already getting quite long. Ottoman society, as one heavily influenced by Persianate culture, had a lot of the same cultural practices going on, and Ottoman poetry is rife with references to young, beloved, men. **What changed to get us to today's world? That answer, you will not be surprised to learn, is complicated. There is a fair deal of argument about it, but the rough academic consensus is: Europeans**. Muslims in the 19th century were made to feel VERY aware and self-conscious of anything they did that Europeans deemed ""backwards."" Homosexuality in elite Muslim circles was most definitely something Europeans considered backwards. As Europeans penetrated the Muslim world, ever deeper, either economically (in the Ottoman Empire) or in full on colonialism (India, Egypt), they constantly commented on and tried to suppress these practices. Muslim elites, trying so hard to modernize their empires and societies to avoid being colonized, tended to adopt European mores along with technology and institutions. In this climate, the Ottoman decriminalization of homosexuality can be read as an act of resistance to European hegemony. The Ottomans were trying to preserve an old cultural practice while modernizing elsewhere. The practice was inexorably extinguished, however, as more and more European cultural practices and attitudes were adopted. As the practice was slowly extinguished in former Ottoman lands, modern Islamic fundamentalism came along with its radical reinterpretation of Islam and things like homosexuality, and replaced a lot of what I've been talking about here. And then, about a hundred years after browbeating the Ottomans and Persians into subduing homosexual practices, Europeans decided homosexuality was fine, sometime after the mid 1990s. And in a cruel historical irony, they browbeat Muslims for being anti-homosexual, after their great grandparents spent a century extinguishing a vibrantly homonormative society.",,/r/europe/comments/hhub6i/legalization_of_homosexuality_in_europe/fwdulj5/,daimposter,1593450689

2232,"&gt;&gt; In Bavaria, all state authorities are required to have a cross hanging in their foyers, which is just absurd.

To be fair, that law received a lot of criticism (even from the church) and is still being fought in courts. It was a political stunt, trying to appeal to older and right-wing voters. Bavaria’s highest court still has to decide on so hopefully it gets shut down.

But Bavaria is the most conservative state in Germany by far 

&gt;&gt; In almost all German states, there is religious education in school for catholic and protestant students. 

Fair point, we should really get rid of that.

&gt;&gt; There is a mandatory church tax, imposed by the states on members of religious congregations to finance salaries and operating cost of the churches. 

Yup, that should also die. But that’s only if you are a listed member so at least you have the option to not pay that.

&gt;&gt; But, the conservative christian party still is the strongest in Germany and also in many states, so this won't change in the near future.

That’s the root of the problem. People in Germany still vote very conservatively so the religious parts don’t die off (or very slowly at least).

2301,"This is a massive area of debate in legal theory, and people interested in it can get very worked up about it. Some theorists would say that judges follow their guts, rather than making legally sound decisions, while others argue that there are mechanisms which the judges use to come to the right decision. Some theorists even suggest judges make decisions purely on their own personal politics. It's quite an interesting topic, especially when you consider how you think they *should* be making these decisions. 

In practice though, it is exceedingly rare for a case to exist without any form of precedent. Firstly, there is a lot of case law to draw from, going back centuries. I actually saw a divorce case just before lock down which had been decided based on Roman considerations of property. That was an extreme example but depending on the area, many key cases are from the Victorian era and even earlier. 

Secondly, there is a process called development by analogy. This where there isn't a direct precedent but a similar case was decided in a different area of law. Finally, there is law from abroad. As the common law systems generally stem from the same source, there are common principles in all of them. As a result, if a case has been decided in Australia which is the same, this provides guidance which can help the decision making process in the UK. If after all that, there really was no precedence at all, judges can consider legal theory and what academics have to say on the matter.

It's also not the case that the first judgment passed wins and becomes law though. A higher court can easily overturn the decision or choose not to follow it, normally on the grounds that the original court made a mistake in their application of the law. There can also be situations where you have two competing judgments, which later cases choose between. These don't tend to last very long but it again demonstrates that it's not a situation where the first decision sets the path for life. Besides, the ultimate indicator of the law is statutes. Parliament could pass a law at any time to change what the courts had decided.",,/r/europe/comments/hhub6i/legalization_of_homosexuality_in_europe/fwd2xlk/,OctogenarianSandwich,1593435492

I never said that. 

&gt;Yeah what about katsifa?What did the greek government did?

Doesn't have to be the government. The greek propaganda machine was in full force to portray the incident as Albanian police killing an innocent man. Not to mention the crowds of ultra-nationalists who came to southern Albanka and their hateful chants and irredentism.

&gt;
I don't remember Greece starting a petty conflict for the last 20 years atleast.From Turkey to Albania.Just name one petty conflict.Or even a policy that greeks have that tend to create these conflicts.

- the Greek minority here is without a doubt privileged. The Greek government  knows this very well but will threaten blocking us from entering EU just to get some votes from nationalists.
-At the request of your Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 2018, 30 cham Albanians were stopped at the border. Basically you won't even allow old people to visit their parents graves. 
-interference in our Orthodox church
-the Katsifas incident as I mentioned
  
Most importantly:

-the Peshkëpi Incident https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peshk%C3%ABpi_incident

2354,"Swede here. Personally I think the international media coverage is quite wrong. 

The one thing I and many with me think has been handled incorrectly is the fact that COVID made its way into nursing homes were elderly who can't take care of themselves anymore live. 

But nursing homes are run by the municipalities, and the government did what they could and banned visitors from nursing homes early. The fact that many municipalities have had the disease in their nursing homes most likely comes from staff not calling in sick. Either because they didn't feel sick even if they were, or because they didn't think they had COVID and were dumb enough to go to work anyway. Nursing homes are often understaffed and I think it's quite common to feel like you're too needed to call in sick.

I still don't think locking down the entire society would've been a good solution and I don't think it would've helped us much. And a lot of you seem to think it's ""business as usual"" here but it's really not. Restaurants are empty, flights are canceled, events of all sorts that gather more than 50 people are canceled. We couldn't travel more than 2 hours from our homes until just recently. But keeping everyone locked inside would not have helped us nor would is the government able to take such a measure because it's against the constitution. 

So we are critical about what's been done wrong which is the nursing home situation - but we aren't very critical of ""the lockdown"" which everyone abroud focuses so heavily on.",,/r/europe/comments/hhwasb/survey_of_government_response_in_eu_states_to/fwd3d6p/,Kakoregott,1593435785

Quite the opposite. Imperialist doctrine would dictate that a population not in rebellion, whenever possible, be fed, kept safe and kept entertained. Starvation as an imperialist military strategy absolutely exists, but to be used against a territory in rebelion or under foreign control, so as to loosen the reigning powers hold over a city under siege or a region or country at war. Trying to induce famine in Germany during WW1 (or the Germans trying to do the same to the UK) would be historic examples of that.

Here we see business interests being put over the stability of the Empire. The famine drove thousands out of Ireland and can be pointed to as the beginning of the end of the union between Ireland and Great Britain. 

Hence why I would call it a capitalist famine. The Irish didn't get food because they couldn't pay for it. That's the long and short of it. Considerations of building and maintaining the Empire in addition to  basic human decency were overridden in favor of profit. 

Replacing food production with cotton used to make sails for ships, that might be an argument of a domestic imperialistic famine. Putting the needs for expansion above human life.

1. Rampant, low-key corruption and abuse of state resources was basically completely overlooked and easy to benefit from (eg people using factory equipment for their side hustle).

2. Products were easier to fix, maintain and upkeep because of low selection, long lifetime (=lots of avalible parts) and no need to constantly innovate.

3. Enterprise managers weren't grossly overpayed (eg got 3x times the pay of an avg worker, not 30x)

4. And most importantly, the socialist regime most certainly helped bring out hundreds thousands of destitute poverty, gave cheap housing and brought basic infrastructure and amenities everywhere. However this was more of a one-time jump as from the 70s standards of living barely grew and in some cases even declines, and happened at the expense of land-holding peasents, the middle and upper class.

The law establishes a rule, gives conditions, sets minimum and maximum fine/sentence if needed.

Then, a decree from the government puts the law into effect and gives more precisions on how it should be applied.

And lastly, the judges work with it, establish interpretations, check it with the higher court and create typical ways to apply the law through precedents.

This works, in large part, because our judges aren't elected but trained (and of course are not in the State's hierarchy, gotta keep them powers separate).

The French system is pretty in depth in term of details, because there's roughly 3 successive filters on how the law can be applied, while still remaining somewhat agile at the ground level.

2453," I have for example read historians report that even as early as Abu Bakr reportedly had a sodomite burned at the stakes, and the fourth Caliph, Mohammed's son-in-law Ali had a sodomite thrown from a minaret. So I do not know if this stance that Christianity as a whole brought homophobia to an un-homophobic Islam sits right with history.

I do, however, clearly recognize that homophobia was a large part of European culture and in more modern times through for example the Ottoman empire, much of the Muslim world was very influenced by Europe as a whole. And I do recognize that there clearly were Muslim societies that were very progressive. But my issue from the start was the comment putting all of Islams homophobia directly linked to Christian Europe. And I am well aware that Christian Europe has a lot of homophobia too.

I do not think, and this is the point of my argument, that you can just put it all on modern Christian Europe so casually and broadly as much of this comment section has done because much of the modern Ottoman empire was progressive. As it is right now, Europe is more progressive than most other Islamic nations when it comes to the topic, so the cultural influence was clearly more a time-specific thing and not something totally connected with Islam as a whole. I think it ignores a big part of more ancient history and accounts of it little to none to lay this much at the feet of Christian Europe.",,/r/europe/comments/hhub6i/legalization_of_homosexuality_in_europe/fwcufvz/,Karlito1618,1593428670

Also they're cowardly and weak leaders too because they decide to dump all responsibility on a government agency so they can blame them if it goes wrong by saying ""but we did nothing we just listened to the experts!!!"" but if it goes well they'll obviously take full credit.

This is indicative of a weak leader (as is everything else they've done for the last couple of years) since accepting responsibility and making the call is definitely a large part of being a leader.

But its a bullshit government built on corruption and lies anyway. The one in charge is a person who went from being a union leader to being a prime minister, what kind of services did he do for the party while a union leader to be able to make that switch?

Also another minister fell on the sword by claiming responsibility for an IT scandal a while back and saying the prime minister knew nothing about this (which everyone knows was a lie) and as a reward when the heat went away he got to be the minister of something else, even though he had claimed responsibility for something that should be career ending.

They also have fucked up so many international deals, weakened Swedens influence on foreign politics and our ability to promote humanitarian causes etc.

2492,"&gt; And I think LGBT should ask for those small things instead of demanding marriage rights which triggers country the most

I can't imagine my private life being so sad to have to take interest in someone else's. This is the problem - they're triggered by the thought of gay marriages, they want someone else to be inferior to them. I've grown up in a pretty radical and religious area and that's exactly what it was like. After all, someone else getting married doesn't affect you, especially if you don't know them.

The aspect of not wanting them to adopt children is also pretty wild to me since there have been numerous studies showing that children raised by same-sex parents are as healthy physically and mentally as those of them who have both a mother and a father figure. Everything, and especially this, is much better than to let the child live in the system forever. That would also give the chance to some older ones to be adopted, since couples, if going for adoption, they will most likely want a newborn without any mental scarring.

I think the changes in mentality will come with time, as the now young generation gets older. But yeah, it's both approaches are pretty sad and I can't imagine how discouraging it has to be for lgbt folks who just want no discrimination and not to decorate their balcony with plastic pink dildos.",Poland,/r/europe/comments/hhub6i/legalization_of_homosexuality_in_europe/fwcup3a/,Momonoko,1593428916

2531,"&gt;should be universaly condemned.

What should be universally condemned? Totalitarianism? Yes. Mass murder? Yes. Repression of social and human rights? YES.

''Communism'' *inherently* does not mean that. That's the issue - the baseline ideas of socialism or communism do not require mass murder or ethnic cleansing, and, on the contrary, asks for decentralization of power, destruction of hierarchies, democracy in all facets of life. 

That's the problem - conflating real life regimes with the ideological and political goals people have. I sure as fuck do not want a totalitarian communist system, but that does not mean I do not agree with some of the principles that socialist thinkers have thought of - e.g. workplace democracy or increased municipal/community autonomy from centralized power structures.

That is what ''that was not real communism'' means - it's a **genuine** critique of the regimes that used the socialist/communist label even though their policy was way off of what actual socialist or communist societies call for.

It's like if there was an organisation for animals liberation and veganism but that only ate meat and advocated for opening more factory farms and hitting dogs - after all animal liberation from life is a way of liberation, and veganism can only be achieved if all meat and animals are eaten!

Pinochet was the last coup plotter to join. Previously he was in charge of Allende's security, *and actually did the job*. Pinochet only cared for his own power and climbing up the ranks.

Pinochet screwed them over and made himself the sole power. Pinochet had this lil' bad habit of double crossing anyone to gain more power.

Irrelevant.

&gt;Pinochet only cared for his own power and climbing up the ranks. Joining Allende increased his rank, and so joining the coup.

And?

&gt;Pinochet screwed them over and made himself the sole power. Pinochet had this lil' bad habit of double crossing anyone to gain more power.

Yes, and?

Do you, like, understand communist theory? Because you are oversimplifying it to 200%. You can make an utopia out of every ideology, doesn't mean that the said ideology lacks people with reality check.

&gt;Capitalism still provide better quality of life. I lived in country that tried for 70 years and still failed. How many more attempts those Western fools need to understand that this theory doesn't work?

Capitalism fails and still proceeds to fail in several areas in the world. India is one, USA's contrast between poverty and wealth, several African nations like Somalia or Congo...
So I don't understand this romantification of capitalism.


&gt;They must be hiding information about this great success very good, so nobody knows about it. Just to keep immigration to this Eldorado low.

Or maybe you just don't care to read about them. I'll give you a clue - India.

&gt;But that idea of equality lays in the foundation of communism/socialism.

It lies on abolishment of classes and equal treatment. You are misinterpretating what it is, yet again.

&gt;They preach that every human wants to be equal and that's wrong. Competition leads to progress, equality just makes everyone equally poor. 

Pfft, when people say they want to stand on equal grounds, they don't mean that they should be equal in everything.

Also not always, competition can as well destroy people as much. It is always often regarded as a very unhealthy look on life, comparing it to rats' race.


&gt;Hell no. Nothing was addressed, if anything situation with disparity became worse after Stalin's death and closer to USSR breakout.

USSR was heavily pushing for higher literacy rate and for limitation of unemployment percentage. Guess what happened after USSR fell and how many people lost their job due to those circumstances.

&gt;Members of ""nomenklatura"" were getting personal service by special grocery stores, were getting special medical service and so on. While simple workers were facing deficit and having to stand in lines for 2 hours to buy meat or taking trains to Moscow to buy kielbasy, because there were no meat supplies available in their city.

That's simply how oligarchic systems work. Doesn't disprove what I said, though. USSR still fought hard with it's programs.

&gt;Problem with Russian oligarchy today has to deal with corruption. Because Russia is failed state where laws not working.

No, it's because of Russian cosciousness. People there are fine being ruled by one strongman, they don't care for democracy really. It's all tied to history.

&gt;In USA there's respect for rich people, everyone wants to be rich, people understand that those people made money because they worked hard and were smart to make investments.

That's very sugarcoating. American Dream never worked. People seeking wealth in USA would only find low-paid jobs at the local harbour.

And by ""were smart"" you obciously mean ""fucking over their workers with low pay and minimal safety treatment"". People don't get insanely rich doing everything ethically.

&gt;Still this bad example doesn't cancel capitalism, but shows that laws must be obeyed.

Yet if it was communism, you'd jump to cancel it on the spot.

&gt;Corruption is enemy of every system, but capitalism can fight it with democracy. Socialism can't exist with democracy, because people won't support it, only dictatorship, and dictatorship brings corruption.

Communists were historically one of the biggest supporters of democratic institustionalism. Getting rid of republican parlimentarism doesn't mean end of democracy. There are countless cases of democratic socialism at play. But you'd rather sit and keep repeating ""capitalism good, socialism bad"". No depth perception whatsoever from you.

&gt;That's insane. Making $30/month is doing well? I'm out of words. When half of their women selling bodies on the streets to foreigners it's not doing well.

You are talking about the most extreme cases.
I guess saying that in USA some people make 19$/month means econony is doing horribly.

Also, do you have anything against sex workers?

&gt;Oh, see, you starting thinking. And why that economical crisis happened in Venezuela, country with world largest oil supplies? UAE is doing great, Venezuela struggling. Where's the catch?

Because it preferred to not sell their national resources to the devil. Why would they trust USA, the country that put banana republics in Central America? They feared they'd fare the same way.

&gt;Most people don't think either. Take BLM that rioting for equality, instead of moving back to African continent where all people of their race live in one.

You must be truly insane...

&gt;Rationally. Based on personal experience of myself and my family.

A few caveats:

* This is only ""by the book"". While legalization on the books is generally an indication of improvement in societal attitudes as far as homosexual relationships, in some cases legalization does not mean effective legalization on the whole territory (Checyna in Russia is an example of this, where being homosexual is still de facto illegal) and it being illegal on the books it does not mean it is de facto illegal (Israel is an example of this);

* This considers all types of homosexual relationships. Often lesbian relationships were legalized before gay ones, or were never officially illegal;

* This considers only when homosexuality was officially legal in the whole country. In some cases, some parts did it earlier than other. Sometimes the difference is minor (East Germany in 1968 and West Germany in 1969), sometimes large (in some Swiss cantons it was legal in 1798, in the whole country in 1942; in the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies it was legal before 1861, but illegal in the Kingdom of the Sardinia, and it was fully legal in Italy only in 1890; in England and Wales it was legal in 1967, in Scotland in 1981);

* This considers the last time it was legalized: in some countries - such as Serbia - it was legalized, then made illegal again, and then finally legalized again;

* If a country was a part of another country which made homosexuality legal, and never made it illegal afterwards, the date of legalization is considered (in Iceland it was legalized in 1940 as a part of the Kingdom of Denmark; in the Vatican in 1890 as part of the Kingdom of Italy)",I Like Maps,/r/europe/comments/hhub6i/legalization_of_homosexuality_in_europe/fwcb7e7/,JoeFalchetto,1593409824

NATO should be reformed and re-branded. It's clear that many NATO countries have no clear commitment to such an alliance.

2912,"&gt; I wonder how those talks were perceived at the time after Vietnam war painted a new face of the USA.

Honestly? It might have worked. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 sort of inverted the roles, and suddenly the USSR found itself stuck in their own ""Vietnam"" and fighting a hopeless battle against the insurgency. Reagan was also well received because he came after Jimmy Carter, whose foreign policy was more liberal, but did not really work out for the US at that time

https://millercenter.org/president/carter/foreign-affairs

&gt;Carter believed in the rule of law in international affairs and in the principle of self-determination for all people. Moreover, he wanted the United States to take the lead in promoting universal human rights. Carter believed that American power should be exercised sparingly and that the United States should avoid military interventions as much as possible. Finally, he hoped that American relations with the Soviet Union would continue to improve and that the two nations could come to economic and arms control agreements that would relax Cold War tensions.

Carter was seen as the President who allowed Iran to become a staunch anti-US power, gave away the Panama Canal, presided over a period of inflation and stagnant economic growth, ""allowed"" the USSR to invade Afghanistan (not really his fault, but politics doesn't work out that way), etc. He lost the next election to Reagan by a landslide, and Reagan promised the opposite of Carter's policies. Reagan called for action, an active campaign to finally defeat the USSR head-on. He wouldn't allow something like Iran to repeat itself, his policies would be extremely aggressive in countering any governments that were aligned with the Soviet Union, the army would be built up in a massive arms race, etc.

3043,"&gt; I’d love to take a road trip through Europe.

A recommendation is a loop around the Baltic Sea. From the Netherlands, go Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Germany, Netherlands. 

Assuming you take the boat from Stockholm to Turku (SW Finland) and from Helsinki to Tallinn, it's about 5000km total. You can do it in 2 weeks if only visiting highlights, though I'd recommend 3 weeks or longer if possible. Optionally you can add St. Petersburg, though it gets a little more complicated with the visa application and schedule (you need to have a hotel booked ahead of your visa application, which also locks your travel schedule down). Another possible extension is to do add Czechia after Poland on the return trip. 

You can get on the boat from Stockholm to Turku without reservations if you arrive at the port early enough. You'll be first in line to board ""if there's space left over"", which in practice is guaranteed for the first 10 cars or so even during high season.

My bad, then. Yes, schools were full of propaganda and romanticizing. Reminds me of how we romanticize our history here in Poland...

&gt;We're aren't talking about writers from 19-20th century, but about modern idiots, who've read them damn books and caught the virus.

So, essentially the same thing? You read the book and take their ideas, their ideals weren't utopian. They could only get them by misinterpretating what they meant.


&gt;You talking about anarchism,

Which IS a part of socialism.


&gt;it's Kropotkin, not Kropkin.

My bad.

&gt;There no single anarchist state/society created in the history of humankind that achieved success and provided great level of life to it's people.

Because ""anarchist state"" is not a thing. Anarxhism exists on a sub-administrative level. Several smaller communes achieved much good withon the territory of some states.

&gt;Life is still a fucking beauty contest and some animals think that they are created more equal than others. It's in human nature.

Again, no one thinks everyone is equal in a literal sense. To be equal would mean to be the same person.


&gt;While regular workers in USSR were living in poverty, members of communist party were enjoying the life, they were hardly working and getting food supplies from special stores, while regular people couldn't buy enough food to feed kids.

Which was later addressed by post-stalinist govts. USSR fought hard with poverty and tried to bring the disparity closer. And about the rulers being very rich... of course? Russia was always an oligarchic nation, that is not easy to change. Kerensky's govt wouldn't change that. Yeltsin couldn't.



&gt;Cuba is fine?

Yeah, they are doing well economically and politically. Not as well as they could, but still.

&gt;Venezuela is supporting maternity leave? How nice.

'twas a snarky comment on how USA doesn't have one.

&gt;Then why don't you move there and live in a dream? 

Because I don't want to be in country that is in a crisis maybe? Also because I hate humidity.

&gt;I support the least state involvement into economy possible and not ashamed at all.

So essentially you want the economy to be unmanaged. That always leads to late-stage capitalism, where with time big corps take the steer. There NEEDS to be some level of govt involvement, otherwise the state would eventually bastardize itself. You think how did USA got out of depression? Or how it got into one?

&gt;I'm just offering to move those people who unhappy with cruel and evil capitalism to the system more suitable for them. Commie/socialist state. What's wrong with that?

Because most people don't move out, when their country is doing horribly. Damn why didn't Hitler move out of Germany if he hated Weimar Rep so much. Or Rosa Luxembourg. Or hell, Mosley.

&gt;Why don't they try it before buy and fucking up their own country?

I mean, by this point I know already that you irrationally hate anything socialist-related and that you are horribly biased against it, but come on...

total attacks: Again you enter the same situation like murders. You simply get the number of attacks that werent caught. It could be 1 guy that did it it could be a vast network of 500 people.

Arrests: You get the immediate found people with probabel cause that were either in the process of starting an attack or were actively prevented from creating the organizations for it. This is by far the best example since even if they dont get convicted 100% the rates of convictions should be universally spread across all fields.

When in 1938 with the ""Reichskristallnacht"" the persecution of the Jews began everywhere, Wilhelm judged that it was a ""disgrace what is happening now at home"".  The army had to intervene now, the old officers and all decent Germans protested.  The foreign states would have to recall their envoys and representatives, ""then the Nazis would give in.""

Als 1938 mit der ""Reichskristallnacht"" die Judenverfolgung überall einsetzte, urteilte Wilhelm, es sei eine ""Schande, was jetzt zuhause vor sich geht"". Die Armee müsse jetzt eingreifen, die alten Offiziere und alle anständigen Deutschen protestieren. Die auswärtigen Staaten müßten ihre Gesandten und Vertretungen abberufen, ""dann würden die Nazis schon kleinbei geben"".

Kaiser Wilhelm on Hitler in an interview with the journalist Buckhardt

“There is a man alone, without family, without children, without God....He builds legions but he doesn’t build a nation. A nation is created by families, a religion, tradition: it is made up out of the hearts of mothers, the wisdom of fathers, the joy and the exuberance of children. [Of Germany under Hitler he says]....an all-swallowing State, disdainful of human dignities and the ancient structure of our race, sets itself up in place of everything else. And the man who, alone, incorporates in himself this whole State, has neither a God to honour nor a dynasty to conserve, nor a past to consult....
For a few months I was inclined to believe in National Socialism. I thought of it as a necessary fever. And I was gratified to see that there were, associated with it for a time, some of the wisest and most outstanding Germans. But these, one by one, he has got rid of or even killed....He has left nothing but a bunch of shirted gangsters....
This man could bring home victories to our people each year without bringing them...glory....But of our Germany, which was a nation of poets and musicians and artists and soldiers, he has made a nation of hysterics and hermits, engulfed in a mob and led by a thousand liars or fanatics....”

3097,"&gt;That being said, though, I like the Cyrillic alphabet more.

Same, for sure, but for the times when it gets transliterated it would be nice to have an established standard for each language using diacritics to avoid digraphs, especially for situations where you end up with double digraphs like Zaporizhzhia. Double digraphs really bother me... I don't know about Belarusian, but Ukrainian transliterations are a very inconsistent mess currently.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; I would personally support a ""h"" in Russian, Ukrainian and Belarussian for ""x"", ""g"" for ""г"" in Ukrainian and Belarussian, and ""ģ"" for ""ґ"" in Ukrainian. 

The problem I see with this is that in Ukrainian 'г' is much more like 'h' than 'g' in other languages except for Polish where it's not like either. Using 'g' leads people to pronounce it like Russian 'г'  which is the same as Ukrainian 'ґ'  instead of 'г'... For Ukrainian I'd go for 'h' with a diacritic, not sure which diacritic, for 'х', 'h' for 'г', and 'g' for 'ґ' since that would make the symbols match the sounds for the most other languages. Belarusian 'г' is different, and I really don't know what would be a good transliteration for it. It seems like there's nothing close to a consistent symbol for the voiced velar fricative in different languages.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; The ""c"" for ""ц"" (цапля), makes sense, because that's what other Slavs use, like in the Gajevica alphabet.

3137,"&gt; Tankosić (who was not in ""Narodna Odbrana"" as you claim)

He was in NO after 1908 in Bosnia, he was later fighting as chetnik in Macedonia 1912 (Princip wanted to join his unit, but was declined). Chief of NO in Bosnia at the time of assassination was Milan Vasić.

Also, which Pribićević?

&gt; Imagine, Serbs living in Serbia developed patriotic feelings in a time of nationalism

They were from Bosnia, they got involved into Serbian cause in Belgrade, at least some of them. I am not accusing anyone of anything, just pointing out the facts.

&gt; And Princip who was a minor from Bosnia and never served army couldn't have joined a secret society of Serbia's military personnel

He wasn't a minor and according to some sources he was member of the Black Hand. Look: James Lyon, Serbia and the Balkan Front, 1914: The Outbreak of the Great War, p. 58

&gt; Black Hand used it to further the goals of Serbia, yes. But the fact stands that Young Bosnia came to Narodna Odbrana for aid, and Black Hand got involved through proxies

That's one way to look at things. It is possible that both groups came up with the idea of assassination at the same time. But the fact that BH was training them first to kill Potiorek and the target was changed later to FF, speaks for itself.

Also if Young Bosnians were in the first place Yugoslavian activists for them Potiorek seemed as much natural target than filo-Slavic FF. The archdukes idea of creating third South Slavic part of AH monarchy was terrible news for officials in Belgrade, because it could lost its status to Zagreb.

&gt; They gave them guns and training how to use them, everything else was already planned out by Young Bosnia.

It is impossible because the visit of archduke in Sarajevo was announced on March 1914. At this point most of them were in touch with BH. Also both groups were in contact only via BH (Ilić and Ciganović) they weren't able to plan assassination alone. They met for the first time in the courtroom. Also members of the second group didn't know eachoter before they met Ilić, who recruited them.

As I said Young Bosnians weren't able to plan and execute this assassinations alone, because it wasn't really an organisation but rather, environment, they were organised in the small groups or similiary thinking young men. Żerajić in 1910 was acting alone and failed.

&gt; And by the way, your theory that the Young Bosnia was hiding Black Hand's involvement doesn't hold water since they are the ones who outted them in the first place during the Sarajevo trials.

The Sarejevo trials took place in October 1914, war started on July 28, it didn't matter what they were saying at this point. Princip and Cabrinović initially (in June) were even denying they knew eachother. It was Ilić who testified who exactly was involved and that they travelled to from Serbia. Nonetheless none of them ever mentioned the Black Hand.",Poland,/r/europe/comments/hheowo/on_this_day_in_1914_franz_ferdinand_archduke_of/fwaw8np/,iwanttosaysmth,1593378273

Belgium definitely had a role in setting up things for the Rwandan genocide by categorizing the population between Hutus and Tutsis. However, what happened in the Congo Free State wasn't a genocide, as there was no intent to eliminate the population. It was a horrible crime against humanity, and Leopold II and the Belgians who participated in it definitely deserve all the blame, but it doesn't qualify for the definition of genocide.

Unfortunately, nowadays every time a large number of people are killed, the word genocide pops up, but we have to remember that a genocide is much more horrible than that, as it is corresponds to literally planning the extinction of a large group of people (nation, ethnicity, religion...).",Belgium,/r/europe/comments/hhc7sx/early_1900s_german_caricature_on_different/fwaiayd/,Pampamiro,1593370990

Austria Hungary was not unstable, it took the most deadly war in human history until then and a devastating peace treaty to break it apart.

Franz Joseph was a beloved monarch and Ferdinand was a known proponent of modernisation. Unless the hasburgs did horrible mistakes, it would be very likely the United States of Austria would be a thing in a world without ww1.

The Germans had no such ambitions. They were already the largest European economy and had accumulated enormous amounts of prestige due to their scientific community and social welfare. In the plans they had made if they won ww1 we see they planned to annex very little land. What they wanted was to create a monarchic European Union that would bind all European states to them in perpetuity.

3338,"&gt;Most of the organisation leaders share a similar ideology.

Well I disagree. If you can't prove it, it's just based on your gut. And I can't argue with your gut or your feelings.

&gt;Why not attacks on white people by BLM supports are fairly common, the idea that police brutality against white men should be addressed is always met with outrage from BLM leaders and its supporters.

[I beg to differ.](https://blavity.com/blm-activists-call-attention-to-graphic-video-of-daniel-shavers-death-at-the-hands-of-arizona-police?category1=news&amp;subCat=race-identity) here's an article about how BLM also wanted justice and attention for the unlawful killing of a white man.

&gt;You have that backwards all lives matter is the only valid stance someone who cares about equality can take, the resistance to that an the insistence on racial segregation of the issue demonstrates that equality isn't the goal of many BLM activists.

Black lives matter means all lives matter. Black lives matter got it's name because of the apparent need to say that **black lives matter too**. Not, like you seem to be implying, that black lives matter more.

The entire idea behind black lives matter is that in the current climate it seems like black lives matter less, and therefore there is a need for a movement that fights for equality for all ethnicities. Sadly, it seems to be the case that black people face more discrimination than other groups, and thus the name.

Having a large merchant fleet and the ability to industrially be the second largest exporter of seafood in the world is thus a direct consequence of this.
Why is it so important to you to pretend that oil had nothing to do with it?

""Norway had Europe's largest GDP per capita already before world war 2""
What are you trying to prove with this?
It is a straight up lie.
Some excerpts from the Economic History Association:
""The international postwar recession beginning in autumn 1920, hit Norway more severely than most other countries. In 1921 GDP per capita fell by eleven percent.""

""Norway pursued a long, but non-persistent deflationary monetary policy aimed at restoring the par value of the krone (NOK) up to May 1928. In consequence, another recession hit the economy during the middle of the 1920s. Hence, Norway was one of the worst performers in the western world in the 1920s""

""the country never saw a convincing recovery before the Great Depression hit Europe in late summer 1930. The worst year for Norway was 1931, when GDP per capita fell by 8.4 percent.""

I think the ""ch"" comes from Polish, because afaik, the digraph ""ch"" is what, for us, would be х, as in хор, or хан. The ""c"" for ""ц"" (цапля), makes sense, because that's what other Slavs use, like in the Gajevica alphabet.

I would personally support a ""h"" in Russian, Ukrainian and Belarussian for ""x"", ""g"" for ""г"" in Ukrainian and Belarussian, and ""ģ"" for ""ґ"" in Ukrainian.

And the work you've linked is discussing that very point: 

&gt; The first panel reveals the typical anti-Prussian militarism of ‘‘Simplicissimus”. In the German colony, order reigned supreme. All the animals have been lined up and numbered. The giraffes have been taught to goose-step, and the crocodile has been tamed. The small sign in the 
background indicates that all noises and claws are forbidden. Conspicuously absent from the German panel, but present in all the others, are any images of Africans. Africa, from the German panel’s perspective, appears as a zoo. The colony is a laboratory. It is a place where order can be imposed through violence, and where society and animals can be studied. The violent campaign of genocide, occurring as Heine created this image, may very well have shaped this first panel. The presence of the absent Herero and Nama speaks the loudest.

The issue is from May 1904, meaning that the illustrator must've made the illustrations way before that. While it's true that the Namibian genocide was going on at that time, there's no way that the German public back home was aware of it, particularly since the government initially covered it up.",Charlemagnia - personally vouching for /u/-ah,/r/europe/comments/hhc7sx/early_1900s_german_caricature_on_different/fw9gntm/,ColourFox,1593349609

Still, climate change means more extreme weather leading to more randomness in river discharge, which was already a uncertain area of science to begin with (because of the irregularity of peak discharge events). It continually puts more strain and risk on existing defences. 

Dutch people have a lot of faith in water defenses and institutions, I wonder if this has a negative effect on our motivation to deal with climate change.

3677,"&gt;The arrested head of the Drugs Department at the General Directorate for Combating Organized Crime, Tsvetan Pankov, and the head of the anti-drug sector, Kiril Vankov, have been providing an umbrella for drug distribution and trafficking groups for years. In addition, they have taken money to neutralize competition in this illegal market, as well as to provide information on investigations into drug traffickers in order to avoid arrests. This was announced by the spokesperson of the Chief Prosecutor Siika Mileva on Sunday.

&gt;According to the prosecution, they have been receiving bribes from drug traffickers for at least three years. Some paid BGN 50,000 a month for the services of the police. Others questioned in the investigation announced that they had paid BGN 20,000 each.

&gt;The arrest of Pankov and Vankov was announced on Friday. It was under investigation by the Internal Security Directorate at the Ministry of Interior and the specialized prosecutor's office. The action led to the beheading of the CDCOC - a few hours later the director of the service Ivaylo Spiridonov resigned. This was also done by the Deputy Secretary General of the Ministry of Interior Georgi Arabadjiev. Chief Prosecutor Ivan Geshev described the action as unprecedented.

&gt;On Sunday, the state prosecution explained that the two senior officers of the CDCOC had worked with another police officer - an inspector from the ""Crime with Vehicles"" sector in the ""Criminal Police"". He played the role of the group's cashier-accountant. The fourth person in it is not part of the system of the Ministry of Interior. He provided the connection with the people from the drug business.

&gt;According to the explanations of the prosecutor's office, the two officers of the General Directorate for Combating Organized Crime played the good and the bad cop in the scheme of extortion and receiving bribes from people from the drug business. The subordinate Vankov prepared fictitious reports and signals against them, and his boss Pankov asked for money to help them. Providing preliminary information for investigations was one of the areas of work of the organized criminal group, Mileva explained. This led to the thwarting of a number of operations against the distribution and trafficking of drugs in Bulgaria and abroad, according to the prosecutor's office.

&gt;Other ""services"" were providing an umbrella over drug distribution and trafficking groups, as well as striking competition with ""instituting operational cases against specific individuals"".",Bulgaria,/r/europe/comments/hhcoir/heads_of_bulgarian_antinarcotics_department/fw98vtb/,maximhar,1593342824

Also, you're saying that every single one of their stupid attacks is aimed at strong points like caves? So what, we can't have landmarks because maybe, just maybe there might be a PKK soldier in it? 

\&gt;  Kurds and Turks live peacefully with the same rights

Try waving a Kurdish flag in Turkey, or wear Kurdish clothes, hell or even speak Kurdish near a Turk Nationalist. Also teaching Kurdish is banned in public schools still.

\&gt; They both have access to free healthcare, free universities. A Kurd has nothing to gain by leaving all that behind and living in a piss poor in a mainly mountainous hypothetical country.

There is free healthcare, and free universities in the KRG too, your patronizing and lack of knowledge of the matter shows, also you got a problem with mountains?

And another thing, nobody said people have to be forced in and out of a Kurdistan, in the KRG there are many ethnicities (that don't get oppressed) living alongside us and none of them have been kicked out of their homes, millions of syrian refugees (Kurds and Arabs) have come here not because we forced them but because syria did. Since Turks and Kurds live so well together, then the Kurd-dominated lands can be part of Kurdistan, and nobody from istanbul and Ankara gets forced in it and no Turks get forced out of it. Also I have been to the Kurdish cities in Turkey, and they aren't better than cities in KRG, which I assume they didn't get treated like Istanbul or Ankara because they're mainly Kurdish.

Why were they (Croats, Bosnia, Albanians) on NATO's side? Because NATO (Germany, UK, USA) gave green light and financed their independence. 

How do you justify braking away a part of a country that is recognized, part of the UN basically any sovereign country? 
- Simply by demonizing them! So what happens when separatists do nasty stuff and kill/forcefully (re)move people? 
- Don't give it much attention, indict some generals and acquit them later in your own tribunal. Or in some cases even just assign the cruelties to the other side, the Serbs.

When those cruelties are preformed by Serbs, or assigned to them, call it genocide! Easy as 123...

So now that NATO have estabished the narrative (Serbs = bad and boogyman) we can now calm our people at home that get info on this war through the telly, by making them think it's all to for the good cause of fighting the evil...

&gt;Due to initial financial difficulties, construction of the polder did not begin until 1936. Construction of the dikes and the necessary pumping stations was disrupted during World War II during the 1940 German conquest of the Netherlands. The encircling dikes were both closed in December 1940, and the pumping stations started draining in early 1941. The Noordoostpolder was considered to be sufficiently drained in September 1942, and the developmental process was started for the 480 km² of new land.”  
&gt;  
&gt;“Land usage focused mostly on farming. Less fertile areas were designated to be planted as forest land. Land in the polders was state-owned during the entire developmental process. Several years after this was completed, the various plots were distributed among private parties, with priority given to the early pioneers who had been in the polder since the start. Later, farmers from all over the Netherlands became eligible for the remainder.

4000,"Let me break down your questions one by one. I’ll be using several Wikipedia articles to back up my arguments, so please bear with me because this might be long.

You claimed that aside from one famine after WW2, collectivization was beneficial ((source)[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excess_mortality_in_the_Soviet_Union_under_Joseph_Stalin]) :

&gt; The deaths of 5.7 to perhaps 7.0 million people  in the 1932–1933 famine and collectivization of agriculture are included among the victims of repression during the period of Stalin by some historians. This categorization is controversial however, as historians differ as to whether the famine in Ukraine was created as a deliberate part of the campaign of repression against kulaks and others, was an unintended consequence of the struggle over forced collectivization or was primarily a result of natural factors.

This contradicts what you said earlier about there only being one famine in the Soviet Union since farming was collectivized one 1928. This famine occurred over three years after collectivization. It’s also hard to compare the effect of collectivized farming after WW2 because of improvement in agricultural technology.

You question when Stalin destroyed his opposition. Here is another quote ((source)[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Purge]) :

&gt; Eventually almost all of the Bolsheviks who had played prominent roles during the Russian Revolution of 1917, or in Lenin's Soviet government, were executed. Out of six members of the original Politburo during the 1917 October Revolution who lived until the Great Purge, Stalin himself was the only one who remained in the Soviet Union, alive.[6] Four of the other five were executed. The fifth, Leon Trotsky, had been forced into exile outside the Soviet Union in 1929, but was assassinated in Mexico by Soviet agent Ramón Mercader in 1940. Of the seven members elected to the Politburo between the October Revolution and Lenin's death in 1924, four were executed, one (Tomsky) committed suicide and two (Molotov and Kalinin) lived.

Here’s another quote from the same source:

&gt; The purge of the Red Army and Military Maritime Fleet removed three of five marshals (then equivalent to four-star generals), 13 of 15 army commanders (then equivalent to three-star generals), eight of nine admirals (the purge fell heavily on the Navy, who were suspected of exploiting their opportunities for foreign contacts), 50 of 57 army corps commanders, 154 out of 186 division commanders, 16 of 16 army commissars, and 25 of 28 army corps commissars.

This couldn’t fit in the quote, but this was done in 1937, right before WW2. It was later confirmed that the charges of the politicians and military leaders (who by the way were loyal to Stalin) were falsified, their confessions coerced, and that Stalin was heavily involved in these cases. These actions helped show that Stalin’s priority was to keep a grip on power. And Khrushchev spoke out against these actions (only after Stalin died of course).

I’ll just ignore my great grandmother’s example since it is hard to present a fact based argument on some stranger’s grandmother, but for the record her village was right on the frontier with Nazi Germany so there weren’t any Bolsheviks saving her for another 3 years. Furthermore, my goal with questioning Nazi soldiers’ intentions wasn’t to comment on the soldiers themselves, but to show thatHitler was also responsible for the atrocities committed by them. As for their intentions, I was trying to say that Nazi soldiers didn’t all think the same, just like any other group of people.

You asked what independent territories Stalin annexed. In that comment I was referring to the annexation of parts of Ukraine, Belarus, Romania/Moldova, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland, all people distinct from Russians. Stalin annexing these territories led to Russian forces being spread too thin. 

I already gave examples of how Stalin prioritized power over people during the Great Purge, however there’s even more evidence of this when you look at Stalin’s deportation of various ethnic groups. Considering how you didn’t ask though, I won’t bring it up unless you want me to.

In other words, no, people’s lives did not improve as a result of any of Stalin’s actions I have mentioned (collectivization, Great Purge, annexation of territory).

&gt;Whether Stalin did anything good with his power is irrelevant

Many Russians believe that Stalin’s authoritarianism was justified because it was necessary to defeat the Nazis, and that without Stalin’s leadership the USSR may have never won the war. What I’m saying is that even if some of his actions like making an alliance with Germany and repressing dissent helped the USSR defeat the Germans, his primary motivation was power. Everything he did put his power first and the people second. To my knowledge there are no examples of Stalin prioritizing the interests of the people over his power.

They are not a former city state or a tiny, privileged tax haven fallen on hard times - just part of a province which was never meant to function as an independent state.

Sometimes people are left in limbo because a program they'd been benefiting from has had to move elsewhere.

They are not in this state solely due to their own incompetence, but because they are a convenient buffer zone. Russia interferes with impunity and the EU has bigger fish to fry.

4061,"The article you posted fails to mention some key elements:

1) The two doctors who performed the autopsy of the pilot were pressured by circumstances to state that his death was caused by the crash... however the corpse was already in advanced decomposition. The two doctors decided that this could not be ignored and produced a supplement to their original autopsy the following day, forwarding it to the local tribunal, stating that the conditions of the corpse were not compatible with the timing of the crash. This supplement completely disappeared: it was never added to the original autopsy... however its existence was mentioned in a document in possess of a member of SISMI (Italian Secret Services) after many years, during a perquisition of his house following the investigation of other terrorism cases.

2) Photos of the wreckage taken by US personnel in service in Italy were discovered, showing details of presumed shell and/or splinter damage. This parts were not present on the wreckage found the 18th of July.

3) A series of testimonies indicates that a MiG-23 (that one? another one?) crashed in Calabria the night of the 27th of June, the day of the Ustica massacre: soldiers in service in Calabria were ordered to guard the area or the crash; in the days after the 27th of June a helicopter pilot of the military police told a friend he helped in the recovery of the wreckage of a crashed MiG-23 (with the auxiliary tanks still containing fuel), loading the parts on military trucks.

4) The flight path of the MiG-23 described by the Libyans and by the Air Force is not plausible: it would have needed to fly so high before starting its glide that it would have been detected by the Air Force ground radars + by a serie of NATO air and naval units that on the 18th of July were conducting and exercise in the Ionian Sea.

So the scenarios are either two:

A) The MiG-23 found on the 18th of July actually crashed the night of the 27th of June and was partially recovered, removing some of the “sensible” wreckage (shell damaged parts, auxiliary fuel tanks).

B) Two distinct MiG-23s crashed: one on the night of the 27th of June (its wreckage recovered and never seen again) and one on the 18th of July... or both of them on the 27th and one of them left in place? Either case, the version of the pilot crashing due to hypoxyia is not credible.

“Why would a MiG-23 be flying over Ustica?” - we don’t know. We know that Libyan MiGs (MiG-21s in particular) travelled for maintenance to Jugoslavia transiting through Italy with the permission of the Italian government - this obviously pissed off the Americans but Italy was Libya’s number one commercial partner and many steps were taken in order to please Ghaddafi. It seems implausible that the MiG-23 would have been flying back from maintenance in Jugoslavia, as they did not have the MiG-23 in service, but a potential meeting with Soviet personnel on Jugoslav soil would have still been possible.

On a final note: tensions with Libya were extremely high in 1980... Libya had recently gone socialist and in 1979 the embassy US embassy in Tripoli had been burned following the events in Iran, prompting the US to cut relations with Ghaddafi and add Libya to the list of nations known to sponsor terrorist activities. In 1980 Libya was the nº1 enemy of NATO in the Mediterranean, with the USAF relocating some of its F-4 Phantoms from Germany to Egypt to counter the Libyans and the French openly at war with them for the control of Chad.",Italy,/r/europe/comments/hgdok5/40_years_the_itavia_flight_870_crushed_in_the_sea/fw8hcgw/,__Gripen__,1593317377

Firstly, the evidence suggest: from interrogations of captured Afghans with no details on the actual mechanics of the transactions or amounts is pretty thin. In fact it is so thin that it makes the idea that it wasn't passed on the President or VP fairly sensible compared to an active attempt at a cover up.

Secondly there has a years long campaign of leaks from Intel about supposed Russian weapons being provided to the Taliban which has yet to provide any evidence of captured material or transfers. These leaks have received push back and denials from everyone from than SecDef Mattis to the NATO secretary General.

Thirdly, the timing of the leak is rather suspicious being released on the eve of the US draw down in forces in preparation for total withdrawal.

And finally, as a purely strategic lens, if the goal is increasing costs to the US to force a withdrawal from Russia's near-abroad the policy is rather self defeating as the goal has already been achieved.

And while the idea of policy being an emotional sort of pay-back for the 80's might be suggested the idea of it only in 2019-2020 being introduced for that reason strains credibility.

In summation some evidence beyond anonymous leakings of supposed vague confessions of Afghan detainees is required.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuelan_refugee_crisis

&gt; In February 2018, almost 1,400 Venezuelans flew across the Atlantic Ocean into Europe. Most of these (1,160) sought asylum in Spain. The number was a significant increase from 150 in February 2016, and 985 in February 2017. Cultural and linguistic ties are the main reason why Spain is the most popular destination among European countries for Venezuelan migrants.[176] Venezuelan citizens can travel the Schengen Area countries without a visa. 

-

&gt; The vast majority of Venezuelan-born people residing in Europe live in Spain and/or have acquired Spanish citizenship, either in Venezuela or in Spain. Between 2015 and 2018 the number of Venezuelan-born residents in Spain increased from 165,893 to 255,071 people.[177] As of 2019, the number of Venezuelans in Spain exceeds 300,000 people, implying a mass arrival in the 2018–2019 period.[178]

-

&gt; The number and characteristics of people leaving Venezuela can be hard to track. General estimates have been made that capture the scale of the migration. Migration flow from Venezuela to significant destinations (which include most of Latin America, North America, and parts of Europe) has increased from 380,790 in 2005 to 1,580,022 in 2017 (IOM, 2018a), where the estimates are based on each receiving government estimation.[134] There are many migrants who enter a receiving country with regular status, but there are many who do not. The number of those who enter irregularly is difficult to estimate because of their immigration status. 
&gt;
&gt;The top ten destinations (significant destinations) for Venezuelan emigrants are Colombia, Peru, the United States, Spain, Italy, Portugal, Argentina, Canada, France, and Panama.[135] Tens of thousands of Venezuelans have also moved to other locations, including Trinidad and Tobago[136] and other countries in the Americas and Europe.[18][137]",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/hgoutp/unhcr_chief_europe_not_able_to_deal_with/fw8hvm2/,duisThias,1593317759

4074,"The guarantee for current silicon based solar panels is about 25 years. This means the solar panel is guaranteed to still have 80% of its energy production capacity after said 25years. There is a lot of room for unexpected decay left in this margin so a well made panel might last you up to 35-40 years (and will likely still produce energy albeit not as much).

In the EU old solar cells are categorized as electronic waste and the companies that sold them are required to take them back and take care of safely recycling/disposing them. This was mandated by the WEEE (Waste electrical and electronic equipment) directive in 2012 and member states had until 2014 to adjust their national laws. The first plant specialized in recycling solar cells was opened in 2018 in France and they estimated they could increase their capacity to recycle ~50-65% of all the waste solar panels in Europe. I probably don't have to mention that this plant won't be the last of its kind. In case you want to look this up further: The European solar companies are working together on providing this end-of-the-line management to comply with the WEEE directive under an association called PV-Cycle.

Now, looking at what can actually be recycled:

&gt; The main contributor to the total weight of a typical crystalline silicon PV module is glass (75%), followed by polymer (10%), aluminum (8%), silicon (5%), copper (1%) and small amounts of silver, tin, lead, and other metals and components.

Lead and tin are the most dangerous in this respect because they could poison the ground water if they leak out after you'd just dumped broken, old solar panels somewhere in nature.

But if processed correctly in a facility like the above mentioned plant then ~95% of the glas, ~85% of the silicon and ~95% of the semiconductor material can be recycled and the poisonous chemicals are taken care of properly.

-------

Now, last but not least I feel compelled to leave another huge wall of text! xD
Because sorry, but I think you simply the issue tremendously when you say:

&gt; compare to a literal nearly-inert chunk of metal buried several kilometres underground

Its not just as simple as digging a big hole and throwing casket containers inside.. ;) 

In the more than 60 years since the first civil use of nuclear power only one country (Finland) has found a truly suitable location for a geological repository and started building one. All others have failed to do so because as 'geological' suggests a chosen site has to remain safe in geological time spans --&gt; For high-level radioactive waste that's at least a 100.000 years were the engineers have to be certain that nothing leaks into the surrounding groundwater aquifer and later enters the food chain. They also somehow have to make sure that future generations are not too stupid or too curious to open up these repositories again (I'm sure the Pharaohs thought nobody would ever open their graves again and yet here we are showing their corpses in museums merely 4000 years later because someone got interested in digging up the trash of former civilizations).

All this and more (corrosion estimates, earthquakes, plate tectonics, yadayda etc) have to be considered when choosing a site. 

So just scouting and doing research to 'just bury a few chunks of metal' easily costs in the ballpark of 1 billion Euro. Sometimes several like the Yucca Mt site in the US which was canceled after ~$13 billion got spend.

The Onkalo plant in Finland is still under construction since 14 years and was estimated to cost 3.5 billion Euros (number from 2017, likely higher by now). The facility is supposed to be run for 100 years (!) before its ultimately sealed off and hopefully never opened again. And I mean nothing ever happens that changes countries over the course of a 100 years so I'm certain no unforeseen consequences could ever meddle with operating this or other future repositories according to the plan. \^\^

I therefore do indeed wonder if YOU think THIS can compare to a solar cell recycling plant that was build within 4 years and is already operational and profitable &lt;-- I couldn't find its cost but I'm pretty sure its much less than a billion euros! :P


[ps: a nice article that goes into the challenges of constructing Onkalo is this [nyt piece](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/09/science/nuclear-reactor-waste-finland.html) from 2017 which was also was my source for the costs]",Berlin (Germany),/r/europe/comments/hgo1uw/poland_and_czechia_there_is_no_evidencebased/fw8ily7/,_slightconfusion,1593318286

It likely would have only been common during the earliest period of Viking civilisation. Hollywood made it out to be that they were not only a thing but a common thing. In reality, the vast vast majority of helmets were simply rounded without horns and Hollywood only did that to make them seem more barbaric and dangerous. 

It's worth noting that other civilisations in the world actually did frequently use horned helmets such as the  Indo--Persian warriors but even more famous - the Japanese warriors that wore helmets called Kabuto. There wasn't a standard for the look outside of being part of a Samari's fearsome warrior athetic. They did however evolve during the Feudal age from simply symbolic to dual purpose protection. Some were made made horns, others used dear antlers and obviously many had no horns at all.

4114,"&gt; Besides, that crusade that you claim ""failed"" any ""shitty"" was not against you, in fact you're in favour of it. Don't talk about history when you don't know about it''  
  
It clearly demonstrates that you are addressing me as a Turk not as a citizen of Istanbul. Which clearly puts an argument that the crusades or the sack of Constantinople in 1206 were more beneficial for Turks rather than Greeks and also your arguments clearly tells a narrative that the crusades contributed Turks to conqueror Istanbul. 
  
&gt; First off, be able to comprehend that asking for assistance means one is concerned and dedicated to their job and not at all times people are able to overcome difficulties on their own, unless your brain has no capacity to get that. '' 
  
This argument itself shows no clear distinction of the differences and prior conflicts between Catholics and orthodoxies. Asking for Catholic help from an Orthodox state was a dead sentence an it was a dead brainer move. Pope was already trying to get rid of the head of the orthodox due to a rivalry between the two sects. It would be same as Grim the Selim asking for the support of Shah Ismail to assist him in a war which would be a dead mistake. Your lack of understanding on the sect rivalries is laughable. 
  
&gt; Crusade that you claim ""failed"" any ""shitty"" was not against you'' 
This is historically wrong.  Although I could go into a whole another discussion here, I will just say that the Great Schism between the Eastern and Western Churches occurs during the period (AD 1054), as does the disastrous Battle of Manzikert in AD 1071, which destroyed not only the authority of the Emperor, but also a good portion of the Empire's troops and prestige. 
  
After Manzikert, the Empire slides almost to the verge of collapse. The Turks, taking advantage of the situation, overrun most of Anatolia, and by AD 1081, occupy Chrysopolis, the city opposite Constantinople across the Straits of the Bosporus. Almost all of the Imperial heartland in Asia Minor is lost, save a few small isolated pockets along the coast. A once mighty Empire, now surrounded on all sides by enemies, having fought a losing battle against an endless tide for almost half a millennium, is finally on death's doorstep. 
The whole reason the Byzantium fell to its knees were the never ending political civil war started after their loss in Battle of Manzikert.  
In fact the main reason Byzantine fell was not Ottoman but the Seljuk Turks but still the Turks. Thanks to Mongolians, Seljuks could not go after Constantinople and completely crushed. Same as why the Fall of Istanbul did not take any place earlier than Mehmed the Conqueror, thanks to the Tamerlane destroying Ottomans and causing a civil war. The fall of Istanbul was a process of Turks pushing Byzantium out of Anatolia and eventually ending it with the Ottomans.  
  
&gt;  He can fuck up the city and rest of Turkey however the fancy takes him because he needs to make a fortune of it that way, and you cannot do anything to stop them because your nation as a whole is full of cowards and weaklings. Consequences of Erdogan policies will be much harsher on you in the near future, hopefully very soon. 
  
Thanks to Turkey experiencing two coups in 1960 and 1980 and living in a geography where civil war due to dictatorial regimes happening, no one wants to experience a Syria or Libya in Turkey. It is of course easier for Europeans to make an assumption living in a geography isolated from middle east. Indeed as you say Erdo is a dictator, still he came to power with the votes of Islamists which still shows a sign of democracy ironically. Even if I don't like him, you still need to respect the elections. Also, your lack of knowledge in activities of counter guerrilla and operation Gladio in Turkey shows your illiteracy. Turkey housed the biggest branch of Operation Gladio, hence it has a distinction compared to middleeast and europe. 
  
&gt; Other parts of your comment which you linked herewith several sites to ground, you dragged it out on purpose and it's very much off-topic, so I'm not gonna dive into that.

4120,""" you can have active jihadists cell in your country without having them commit attack on your territory ""

You really can't.

unless the government actively pays and supports the jihadists to attack foreign governments like Saudi Arabia or Iran they will attack the local government they reside in.

The whole purpose of a jihadist is to overthrow the government and install an Islamic theocracy. There's no reason for jihadists to be in a country they won't attack as if they can't get support they will be stamped out and useless to their goals. 

There were a number of jihadists in Bosnia during the 1990 war hoping to create an Islamic state in Europe but after the war was over and they realised the majority of Bosnians wanted them out and the Bosnian government would not follow the Islamic path they all left for the next conflict (Chechnya) to continue their goal or they got kicked out by the government.

Terrorism directly correlates to the number of jihadists you have in the country the largest nation hit by Islamic terrorism have the highest number of jihadists (Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Yemen). 

This can be seen in Europe to the countries with the highest % of Arab and African immigration (France, UK, Germany, Belgium, Turkey) are also have the highest number of terror attacks. This is due to Arab and African immigrants being more likely affiliated with jihadists.

Bosnia has very little jihadists compared to France and Bosnia is much tougher on them due to the burden of having to make sure European nations don't try to pull the Islamic state in Europe bullshit.",Bosnia and Herzegovina,/r/europe/comments/hgqu0c/jihadist_arrests_in_the_eu/fw8193o/,Gibovich,1593306851

4132,"&gt; The first crusade didn't target Constantinople as it was Byzantine back then. In your previous comment, you were talking about people being butthurt about Constantinople and unsuccessful crusades. So I clarified that the crusade conducted against Constantinople benefitted you very well and not the opposite. Even if you meant the first crusade in your previous comment, then it wasn't unsuccessful either. Holy lands were recovered, and you were kicked out of Western and Coastal Anatolia. 
  
To correct you, I especially distinguished the crusades between each other and started referring the first crusade and Latin sack in 1206 which was the fourth crusade. Also I corrected your mistake on how crusades were not against the Turks, which is quite a stupid claim only a brain dead would believe that illiterate bs or greekbot retards. 
  
&gt; in your previous comment  
  
I wrote '' Shitty crusades'', I did not specifically referred to first crusade in that comment but I REFERED to all crusades in general which failed over all.  
  
&gt; So I clarified that the crusade conducted against Constantinople benefitted you very well and not the opposite 
  
You are completely ignoring the reason why the crusade that targeted the Constantinople, aka Latin sack of 1206 , aka 4th Crusade happened. After the Battle of Myriokephalon ( a battle between the Byzantine Empire and the Seljuk Turks in Phrygia in the vicinity of Lake Beyşehir in southwestern Turkey on 17 September 1176) the hopes of Eastern Roman empire on getting rid of Turks from the Anatolia was crushed even with their militaristic aggression. It was to be the final, unsuccessful effort by the Byzantines to recover the interior of Anatolia from the Seljuk Turks. The battle was a strategic reverse for the Byzantine forces, who were ambushed when moving through a mountain pass. the aftermath of the battle made the civil war worse which crumbled the constitution of Eastern Roman Empire. Moreover, because of the failure of Second and Third Crusades , Turks claimed back their territories from the crusade army. Thus, The Pope called another crusade in 1200 to reclaim Jerusalem and lost lands again. However, atrocities committed by the deranged Byzantine leader Andronikos I (most notably, the massacre of Latin merchants in the Latin quarter of Constantinople in 1183), as well as a history of competition between Byzantine and Italian merchants in the Eastern Mediterranean, led Venetian Doge Enrico Dandolo to treacherously turn the Crusade onto the vulnerable city of Constantinople (made so by 20 years of neglect by the incompetent Angeloi, the successors to the Komnenoi). In 1204, the Venetians gained access to the city and proceeded to not only massacre the population, but also burn and destroy countless artefacts, libraries, churches, etc. The victory of the Western Church over the Eastern one was almost complete. 
Overall, the whole discussion shows your lack of understanding of history by claiming Ottomans just took down an already destroyed Byzantium with the disaster of 4th Crusade is quite wrong. I am going to summarize it, so that your brain may process the small information maybe; 
After the battle of Manzikert, The Byzantine Empire was limited to the area immediately around Constantinople, and the Byzantines were never again a serious military force. It is also interpreted as one of the root causes for the later Crusades, in that the First Crusade of 1095 was originally a western response to the Byzantine emperor's call for military assistance after the loss of Anatolia. Manzikert was a signal that Byzantium was no longer capable of being the protector of Eastern Christianity or of Christian pilgrims to the Holy Places in the Middle East. It makes clear that it resulted in the Empire being unable to put an effective army into the field for many years to come. 
It was the first, and only, time in history a Byzantine emperor had become the prisoner of a Muslim commander And after the Byzantium emperor was freed by Alp Arslan, it created a never ending series of civil war in Byzantium empire. 
Hence emperor cried and asked for Pope's help which resulted in the First and the only successful crusade. After the failure of Second and Third Crusades and Seljuks reclaiming back the lost lands successfully and winning the Battle of Myriokephalon, It was to be the final, unsuccessful effort by the Byzantines to recover the interior of Anatolia from the Seljuk Turks. Hence, 4th Crusade happened, so that Catholics could reclaim the lands back. However due to the civil war caused by Turks in  Byzantium and the aftermath atrocities committed by the belligerents of the civil war, crusaders looted and raided Constantinople to punish the Byzantium empire.  
Thanks to Mongolians and Tamerlane, Turks could not conqueror Constantinople earlier which can be interpreted as Greeks were saved by Mongolians. 
Overall, your lack of knowledge in history and completely evading the Turks to oversimplify the conquest of Istanbul as just a big attack from Ottoman, makes you sound like a clown. 1453 was the last final attack on Eastern Romans from Turks. And the Crusade you told that favoured Turks happened because of the Turks as well.

4146,"I agree regarding cheap materials, garish paint and overly perfect textures - formally everything is done correctly but it simply *feels* off. Also - way too straight lines. Buildings back then were built mostly by eye, not by laser sight.

And yes, if I had lived 120 years ago I would have found neo-classical buildings tacky even then for many of the same reasons I disdain McMansions today. At least for me, their sin has been healed by time passed. I don't have the same innate feeling for what was appropriate back then vs. what is appropriate today, stylewise.

I'm happy to say that where I live (Germany) there no new buildings that reference ancient Greek architecture. So I don't have to trouble myself with the horrible idea that modern pseudo-temples will ever gain an aura of class. As for tacky American residential and commercial builds, I sincerely hope that a combination of cheap build quality and shifting economic interests will preclude their surviving that long.

As for why this might be less acceptable today than it was back then: Why do people turn back in time and try to recreate the past? It's obviously some sort of reference, a feeling that things were better back then, that the values of that time are worth emulating. But today we kind of know better. Sure, we need to learn from the past. But we've become much more critical. The Greeks and Romans held slaves. Spartans left sickly babies to die. Women were marginalized. Only reactionaries of the worst kind could point at those times and see them as a model to follow. Architecture, sociology and politics are intertwined and while a layperson can ignore the implications and connotations of certain building styles, an educated architect cannot. That's why most of them would be very unwilling to turn back time 500, 1000, 2000 years and ignore everything that's happened in between.",,/r/europe/comments/hgs402/ludna_9_warsaw_poland_before_and_after_renovation/fw82nla/,Engelberto,1593307772

4185,"&gt; Credit in part should be given to Elon Musk for allowing other companies to use some of the technologies they have created/invented/redesigned under the open source patent pledge.

[A Closer Look at Tesla’s Open-Source Patent Pledge](https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=ca6c332f-2cc5-401b-b80d-36473d0754c7)


Tesla’s agreement not to sue a party for patent infringement extends only “for so long as such party is acting in good faith.” The Pledge goes on to state that a party is acting in good faith as long as they have not:

 1. asserted, helped others assert or had a financial stake in any assertion of (i) any patent or other intellectual property right against Tesla or (ii) any patent right against a third party for its use of technologies relating to electric vehicles or related equipment;
 2. challenged, helped others challenge, or had a financial stake in any challenge to any Tesla patent; or
 3. marketed or sold any knock-off product (e.g., a product created by imitating or copying the design or appearance of a Tesla product or which suggests an association with or endorsement by Tesla) or provided any material assistance to another party doing so.

These conditions could have significant legal and business implications for a company using Tesla’s patented technology.

First, the Pledge states that those acting in good faith will not assert any patent or intellectual property right against Tesla. Note that a company using Tesla’s patented technology is not only giving up the ability to bring an action against Tesla for patent infringement, but any form of intellectual property infringement. This includes trademark and copyright infringement, as well as trade secret misappropriation. Thus, for example, if Tesla copied a company’s source code line-for-line, that company would be required to forfeit the protection provided by the Pledge in order to enforce its rights.

Of potentially even greater consequence, the Pledge states that a company is not acting in good faith if it has asserted “any patent right against a third party for its use of technologies relating to electric vehicles or related equipment.” Therefore, before using technology from a Tesla patent, a company must determine whether it is willing to agree not to assert its own patents against any company operating in the electric vehicle market anywhere in the world. This may be a trade-off that a company is willing to make, but it is not a decision that should be taken lightly. Among other implications, this decision may have a significant impact on the value that investors place on the company’s IP. If competitors are able to use the patented technology of the company, it may be difficult to establish a competitive advantage in the marketplace.

The second restriction limits a company’s ability to challenge the validity of a Tesla patent. This is similar to language found in many intellectual property license agreements. However, there are a few things to note. First, this restriction applies to any Tesla patent, not only the one that the company is using. Second, the Pledge requires that the company not have any financial stake in a challenge to a Tesla patent. The term “financial stake” could be quite far reaching. For example, Tesla could argue that a supplier has a financial stake in its customer’s challenge of a Tesla patent.

Finally, the third restriction withholds the protection of the Pledge from those who market or sell a “knock-off” or provide material assistance to another party doing so. The Pledge does not provide a definition of “knock-off product,” but it does provide one example: “a product created by imitating or copying the design or appearance of a Tesla product or which suggests an association with or endorsement by Tesla.” Hence, a company using Tesla’s patented technology must be careful in its product design to ensure that Tesla cannot assert that it is selling a knock-off.

Agreeing to abide by the Pledge could significantly curtail a company’s ability to protect, defend, and assert its own intellectual property. A company should weigh these implications against the benefits of using the technology before deciding to take advantage of Tesla’s offer. If the company does decide to use Tesla’s technology, it should put processes in place to ensure that it does not violate the conditions of the Pledge and, as a result, lose the protections that it provides.


[Tesla’s Patent Pledge – Using Open Source Bait to Gain IP Leverage](https://www.cclaw.com/2019/10/18/teslas-patent-pledge-using-open-source-bait-to-gain-ip-leverage/)

What Does Tesla’s Patent Pledge Mean?

Tesla is essentially asking companies to give up rights to assert any IP right against Tesla. This presumably includes trademarks, copyrights and patents. This allows Tesla to use the IP of these participating companies without fear of litigation. Moreover, the companies are also required to adopt their own patent pledge to others for the use of EV technology. Effectively, parties that want to take advantage of the Tesla pledge are being asked by Tesla to expose its IP cards to get a seat at the EV table—a showdown against the industry leader and all third-party competitors. Unsurprisingly, many EV space participants have been hesitant of using Tesla’s patents. It appears that patent pledges of this nature intend to encourage innovation and participation in the industry. Yet, it also underscores the importance of intellectual property as Tesla continues to invest in patents and leverage them to dissuade others from enforcing their own rights.", Ėjau rytelia čiūta,/r/europe/comments/hh3tnj/tesla_is_no_longer_the_dominant_force_in_europes/fw85c27/,Sutartine,1593309518

4271,"German here.

Regarding the first point, I would say kind of. Not exactly “the America of Europe“, but “the US lite“. Politically, the UK has always been viewed as “America‘s lapdog in Europe“ here. I would say the UK has kind of an identity crisis because it wants to be as close as possible to the US without becoming the 51st US state and wants to be as close as possible to the EU without giving up it‘s sovereignty. Most people know that the UK and the US have a lot of similarities due to their shared history, but of course there are also a lot of differences. Monarchy vs. Republic is probably one of the most obvious ones.

Concerning the stereotypes, there has been a shift post-Brexit. Before Brexit, I would say the UK was viewed rather positively in Germany. Royalist tea-drinkers with a fancy accent and a relaxed attitude towards life, to sum it up. The wedding of William &amp; Kate was a huge event in Germany lol. Nowadays, post-Brexit, the opinions are a lot more negative. Now it‘s more along the lines of “delusional island monkeys who believe they still have an empire and are governed by a clown“. “Inselaffen“ (island monkeys) is one of the most popular derogatory terms for British people in German.

About the last point, I think the stereotypes about the British in Germany are mainly stereotypes about the English. The other parts of the UK are rather small and not that relevant from a German perspective, so we don‘t have that many stereotypes about them. The stereotypical version of a Scotsman would be a red-haired middle-aged man wearing a kilt and playing the bagpipes combined with a strong accent.

4273,"It's not architects who are mainly responsible for all the shit you see getting built every day. It's investors. Those with the money dictate the outcome of any building projects.

I agree with you that most new buildings are disappointingly generic. That's because it's easy to explain, easy to sell, easy to rent, easy to make money with. But you have to know that those neoclassicist or art nouveau buildings from 125 years ago weren't really that much different. Those stucco ornaments we so admire today were produced on an industrial scale. For apartment buildings you had generic floor plans and for the facades you could choose between any style you wanted: neo-gothic, neo-italian, neo-rennaissance etc. It was simply tacked on. Very similar to contemporary American residential architecture where most buildings try to imitate some style from 100 years ago: craftsman, french, colonial... as I said: 90% of what gets built is shit.

But if you visit a site like [archdaily.com](https://archdaily.com) you can easily find great examples of contemporary architecture (I avoid the term ""modern"" architecture because it so easily gets mixed up with modernism).

As I mentioned in my previous post, the one thing we have lost since then is the common architectural design language. An intact old neighborhood  derives its charm because of its ensemble character. Nowadays we have a multitude of disparate buildings who all try to make some statement but taken together there's just no cohesion.

I would like to see this problem solved and create cohesive neighborhoods through the use of design guidebooks: You can build whatever you want but these are the materials you have to choose from and these are the window shapes and you have to put garages here and trash bins there etc. - if you don't like this style, try the next neighborhood where everything is done differently.

4290,"I'm not a Greek, to begin with. Why are you Turkbots so much desperate that you assume everyone who hates Turks in general to be Greek, Armenian or Kurdish as if only they disgust at you? Whole Europe, as well as many other parts of the world, despise you too even though that's not very pleasant for you. A textbook example would be the r/europe squad.

The first crusade didn't target Constantinople as it was Byzantine back then. In your previous comment, you were talking about people being butthurt about Constantinople and unsuccessful crusades. So I clarified that the crusade conducted against Constantinople benefitted you very well and not the opposite. Even if you meant the first crusade in your previous comment, then it wasn't unsuccessful either. Holy lands were recovered, and you were kicked out of Western and Coastal Anatolia.

&gt;It was your fault to be week in first place to call for Catholic help.

I think by ""you"", you refer to Byzantines. I'm wondering how you can be that sure about my nationality although I never indicated it. But anyway, requiring some help doesn't make someone weak, this means the job they're gonna deal with requires much more effort than only the responsible one could expend. First off, be able to comprehend that asking for assistance means one is concerned and dedicated to their job and not at all times people are able to overcome difficulties on their own, unless your brain has no capacity to get that. Besides, calling Byzantines weak and to ground that, naming the request for Catholic help argument is stupid to the extent that only what a Turk would do. They prolonged the existence of the Roman Empire by 1000 years, almost doubled the Roman empire's life. The Byzantine Empire was already at its last straw during the confrontation with the Turks, it was gonna fall either way, the Ottomans only made it quicker and increasingly filled the geocultural vacuum left by the Byzantines.

&gt;City is ours and we do whatever we want to do with it. None of your business.

500 IQ level argument here. The city is not yours. For now, every little part of it including the 16 million inhabiters belongs to the Erdogan royal family as other parts of Turkey. He can fuck up the city and rest of Turkey however the fancy takes him because he needs to make a fortune of it that way, and you cannot do anything to stop them because your nation as a whole is full of cowards and weaklings. Consequences of Erdogan policies will be much harsher on you in the near future, hopefully very soon.

I don't think conquering a city only to fuck it up afterward adds up to your success.

Also, stop depicting that third world Islamic city as the queen of cities since you cannot fool anyone. Even a garbage dump would look more attractive than that city. This is why I support the liberation of the city and the rest of the Anatolia from occupation and taking you occupiers clear out of Anatolia. So the city can regain its past glory.

Other parts of your comment which you linked herewith several sites to ground, you dragged it out on purpose and it's very much off-topic, so I'm not gonna dive into that. The only thing I see is a classic braindead Turkbot insulting and derogating Greeks, their history etc. and glorifying his savage ancestors. But that's not going to work on anyone, almost the entire world sees you as lowlifes. Enjoy racism you face on the internet and you deserve even more tbh.

But in case you are interested in educating yourself (instead of engaging in flamewars), then the definitive study is “No clear evidence from countries that have enforced the wearing of helmets,” Robinson *British Medical Journal 2006*; 332: pp 722-725. 

Australia implemented a mandatory helmet law, heavily enforced with fines, which very suddenly increased the number of cyclists wearing helmets. This provided the perfect natural experiment to calculate the effectiveness of helmets. If helmets had any benefit at all (at the time it was claimed 85% reduction in fatalities), then it would have been immediately evident in the roadway crash statistics. In fact, there was no benefit was found. While not the only paper that looked at Australia, it was a landmark study that put an end to the idea of promoting helmets for cycling safety (at least in Europe, the greater USA anglo-sphere is another story...).

The other landmark study came from a Stanford helmet lab, which examined *why* helmets don't work.

The guy I voted for has been doing great opposition work (imho) and has been casting crucial votes for example in some very close bills concerning EU wide privacy laws.

I feel that he has been doing exactly what I was hoping he would and thus I feel my vote had some impact in shaping the EU politics. I mean, did you take your EU parliament votes seriously in the past? Or did you not vote at all? Or did you vote in someone like Nigel Farage who even didn't show up in the committees where relevant polices got discussed that he was elected to represent the UK interest in.

TLDR; I find the 'the EU is undemocratic' argument pretty unconvincing. Especially considering how the parliament has consistently gained more importance and influence over the last decades.

&gt;  But I'm glad it's harder to steal highly trained medical staff from Latvia, for example, by offering them more money.

You make it sound as if those doctors or nurses are forcibly dragged from their home country to accept better paid jobs somewhere else.

But that's just a worldwide market dynamic. Talent tends to move to places where its best paid, has the best opportunities or where the lifestyle choices are most attractive.

That's why a lot of German doctors choose to work in Switzerland or the US (much better paid) or people take jobs in Silicon Valley (much, much better paid). And why should an unhappy individual not ditch a former employer when something better lines up!? It also means that long term the former employer has to improve conditions or risk further loss in workers.

Do you know why those companies aren't building nuclear power plants? You say it is because of the emissions caused in construction but that is nonesense, if it were the case then no energy company today would be using and building fossil fuel plants. The reason is that Nuclear power plants aren't currently economically viable, they lose money.

Just for perspective: That is *about* as much energy as is required for all IT, communication and lighting in the country. So wood *can* be a contributor to a cleaner energy supply, but it for sure requires careful forestry, and for sure it would not suffice for all energy or be a good option *everywhere*. On top of that there is always considerations about the emissions from the supply chain, so how this stuff is harvested and processed is also quite important, and the whole topic of the effect of forestry on the ecosystem is a completely separate can of worms.

4546,"&gt;You seem to believe that ""centralized"" means central european states like Germany/France/Netherlands/etc will decide by themselves the approach to take

You got it completely wrong. What I was saying is that ""centralised"" means states like Germany/France or the Netherlands cease to exist or exist in a very diluted way. It's seems very much that's what you are  suggesting, so I believe we are finally on the same page on the meaning of centralisation. Well, what I'm arguing is that wanting those states to remain and continue to represent their peoples is not being anti-EU/eurosceptic. They can and should coexist. Wanting to quash national identities and local autonomies and hiding that goal under a fallacious ""this is the only option"" banner is were the dishonesty lies.

I'm actually sad that the federalist faction on the pro-EU camp has lost so much ground to centralists like yourself, but I will continue to defend the strength of the states where it is possible and the existence of an actual united EU. If that means we'll have states rights discussion like those that there were in the US, so be it. But to wrap up, no I don't think you were able to convince me that an united healthcare system is a necessity for the EU; that is a matter that can still very much be taken care by the states themselves. At most, you pointed out the necessity of a common response to pandemics, but those instruments were already created and it's simply a matter of strengthen them for the future.

4564," 

&gt;Italy sent fresh riot police reinforcements Friday to a council estate in its south where a cluster of coronavirus cases among foreign farm workers has sparked tensions with locals.  
&gt;  
&gt;Some 700 people were placed in lockdown this week in the complex of five blocks of flats in Mondragone -- 60 kilometres north of Naples -- for 15 days, the region’s head Vincenzo De Luca said late Thursday.  
&gt;  
&gt;Local health authorities said 43 positive cases had been identified and tests were being carried out on all the residents.  
&gt;  
&gt;Four of the high-rise blocks house undocumented Bulgarian workers while Italian squatters occupy the fifth, De Luca said.  
&gt;  
&gt;The estate is “one of the thousands of ghettos in Italy, where we amass more or less undocumented foreigners to make them live in more or less heinous conditions,” said Corriere della Sera’s editorialist Goffredo Buccini.  
&gt;  
&gt;Fifty army soldiers were sent in to help secure the zone on Thursday after clashes between frustrated Bulgarians who wanted to return to work to earn money for food and angry locals who blamed them for spreading the virus.  
&gt;  
&gt;Hundreds of Bulgarians who came out to demonstrate Thursday were persuaded by police to return inside, but locals who learned they had left the Palazzi Cirio estate then turned up to hurl stones and trash cars, local media reported.  
&gt;  
&gt;Coronavirus tests were being offered to residents living near the estate and if 100 cases surfaced, the whole seaside town would be locked down, De Luca said.  
&gt;  
&gt;He said a few people with the virus had since slipped through the net and disappeared, but insisted surveillance of the estate would be 24 hours non stop from now on.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Exploited**  
&gt;  
&gt;“The Bulgarian workers... are part of the endless labour force working in the southern countryside without rights, often without contracts, without any security,” organised crime expert Roberto Saviano wrote in the Repubblica daily Friday.  
&gt;  
&gt;“It’s easy in this case to say that those spreading the disease are the foreigners, the invaders, the immigrants, the families of Bulgarian workers accused of going out to continue working,” he said.  
&gt;  
&gt;“But it would have happened the same if it had been Italian workers living in those working conditions, with those wages”.  
&gt;  
&gt;The estate was built decades ago as part of a project to transform Mondragone into the world Mozzarella capital, he said.  
&gt;  
&gt;Furious locals “seem to forget that those workers are essential to the countryside, that without them the (mozzarella-producing) buffaloes would drown in shit and neglect,” he added.  
&gt;  
&gt;It was not the only cluster of new cases in Italy, which lifted its lockdown at the start of June after three months of a pandemic which has officially killed over 34,600 people.  
&gt;  
&gt;At least 64 cases have emerged at a warehouse in Bologna used by express courier Bartolini, including 17 friends and relatives of workers.  
&gt;  
&gt;Italian media identified 10 cases of new clusters across the country this week, including in care homes in Como and Alessandria in the north, and a religious institute in Rome.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/hgxbym/tensions_flare_over_covidhit_ghetto_in_southern/fw6l5a7/,harrisinpc,1593277984

A few months of unemployment doesn't threaten lower-income people's livelihoods (there are exceptions, of course, like people with a lot of debt) in much of Western and Northern Europe. For instance, employees got 90% compensation where I live if they couldn't work. With a minimum wage of €20k/year and subsidies for people with low incomes of \~€5k a year, getting 10% less income for a few months means you can't go out to eat at the local snackbar, can't afford that weekend staying at a camping in the countryside, and can't afford that once-a-year trip to the attraction park with the family - things that were impossible anyways. Getting lower income is bad, but not worse than thousands of people dying. And if we wanted to avoid such situations in the future, we'd best up the social welfare net even further, raise the minimum wage and lower the rents, we shouldn't have to choose between people not dying and people having no livelihood.",,/r/europe/comments/hgsbu2/most_of_europe_seeing_low_numbers_of_new_covid19/fw6lowa/,Luc3121,1593278276

This is a very simplistic take on the issue. I assume you don't work in the energy industry.

% of renewables in electricity consumption doesn't increase linearly, even if we assume that installed capacity does. Germany already has renewable overproduction peaks where they have to export electricity. The higher the share of renewables in overall power capacity, the higher the share of those peaks in power production, and the less this additional renewable capacity actually contributes to existing demand.

Even a simplistic linear regression based on [this data](https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/daviz/co2-emission-intensity-5#tab-googlechartid_chart_11_filters=%7B%22rowFilters%22%3A%7B%7D%3B%22columnFilters%22%3A%7B%22pre_config_ugeo%22%3A%5B%22France%22%3B%22Germany%22%5D%7D%7D) doesn't show Germany getting past France before 2050. You lost ~100gCO2/kWh in 20 years. Still 470 to go. That's 50 more years until you go below the 100 bar.

And then there's the problem of grid infrastructure. Renewable sources don't magically transfer electricity to homes and factories: You need an extensive electrical infrastructure for that. Most countries have a centralised power infrastructure, tailored for high-density electricity sources like fossil fuel, hydro or nuclear. Intermittent renewables are low-density, meaning they need to be spread over a much larger surface to provide a given amount of surface. Intermittence also means you need much more robust region interconnectivity to allow high production regions to dispatch their power to low production regions, and be much more flexible depending on weather conditions.

All this infrastructure work has a cost, and it is a requirement if you want to add a significant amount of renewable sources to your grid. That's not something that's typically accounted for in cost estimates (which are intented for private investor, not grid managers), and that's in large part why Germany has one of the highest electricity prices in Europe right now.

All of these are reasons why you can't expect renewable power consumption to just increase linearly on the world until carbon neutrality is reached. It's a lot more complex than that.",,/r/europe/comments/hgo1uw/poland_and_czechia_there_is_no_evidencebased/fw5vs2i/,Perett2822120,1593263088

&gt; ""At the current rate of uranium consumption with conventional reactors, the world supply of viable uranium, which is the most common nuclear fuel, will last for 80 years. Scaling consumption up to 15 TW, the viable uranium supply will last for less than 5 years. (Viable uranium is the uranium that exists in a high enough ore concentration so that extracting the ore is economically justified.)""
&gt; 
&gt; So it does either get even more expensive than renewables or we have no power at all. Solution: Just go renewables immediatly.

This is a non-argument. First of all, raw natural uranium is such a tiny fraction of the total cost of a nuclear power plant, that uranium becoming 10x more expensive won't affect the total cost in any meaningful way.

Abbot also touches on sea water extraction of uranium, which is currently 5 times more expensive than conventional uranium mining , will extend the supply of uranium to 300 000 years. He fails to include replenishment from the earth's crust in his equation, and according to James Conca( scientist in the field of the earth and environmental sciences for 33 years, specializing in geologic disposal of nuclear waste, energy-related research..) the sea is continuously replenished with uranium from the crust, making sea water extraction of uranium practically renewable, as it will last millions of years.

No, the yearly budget is the budget. The MFF is a promise by member states that they will deliver X amount of funding over Y amount of years, in return for certain sector-specific spending priorities. Since the EU does not borrow, this is part of it securing future funds.

 Just to reiterate in a clearer format: The budget and the MFF are not the same thing. The budget is voted by parliament and the council of ministers yearly and is project-specific, the MFF is signed by the Council of EU leaders and is more high level (sector specific). The budged it a funding promise for the EU to pay others, while the MFF is the promise of the member states paying the EU.

This wasnt the goal of what they were trying to represent. They were trying to represent if the Pro Eu and Contra Eu outweigh eachother if the leave/join question should be asked. Therefor the satisfaction level of each state is not represented

  


&gt; It's obviously a crock of shit. In exactly the same way that you want to remain and so you believe everyone else either does or has changed their minds - that's wishful thinking isn't it? 

First of all, I never stated my views on the EU. Secondly, this very same mindset can be applied to you.

   


&gt; Given we've posts here from practically every nation mentioned saying that EU scepticism is higher in their peer groups than this suggests I'd take the survey results with a big pinch of salt. 

And the same concept should be applied for these posts, because they are not representative, they merely reflect on the same bubble each poster represents.

  


&gt; Here the guys wave their hands around to try to convince us that it's not complete bullshit - but I'm sure it is. Maybe the journalist is wrong about response rates being the cause. It's probably simply because they are not picking people at random.

4837,"&gt;I'd argue that it does, when those jobs are needed for basic function of society and the city's function, and are at the same time jobs that locals renting apartments don't want to do but need them to be done.

But why does this give them a special right? If those jobs are so important, then surely they must pay well and those people can actually afford to live there. If high prices would drive certain professionals out of the city and force them all to commute, there would be a shortage of those jobs and their services would also become more expensive, thus allowing them to perhaps move back. 

&gt;Furthermore, your argument in this comment hinges on ""demand for living in that specific place"", which when it comes to AirBnb is bullshit. 

I have realized that  I'm focusing too much on tourists and short term living, I'll give you that. But short term living also counts as increased demand for living there (maybe I should've just used different words). 

&gt;No one would be so up in arms, if the prices were raising because people wanted to live there. But prices are raising because people want to visit there short term.

4889,"&gt; Yes, and the fact that people need licensing for driving taxis is messed up. Besides being able to drive the car, what skills exactly do you absolutely need to be a taxi driver? Why do you need to get a fancy license to be legally able to do something that requires no additional training? It's great for current taxi drivers that form a monopolistic cartel and work really hard to keep any competition out I guess. 

It's not about the skills required to be a taxi driver of course, but about the governance and responsibilities of the services provider. A licensed taxi driver with a medallion is insured, there is a company with legal liability behind him which can be pursued in the case of damages. Consumer protection is very important in the EU and airbnb/uber/etc dont offer any. By the way we solved the Uber issue here by requiring Uber drivers to get chauffeur's licenses/registrations; surprise, they're not really any cheaper than taxi's now.

It's also unfair competition that hotels that have to abide by minimum hygiene standards, pass inspections, carry insurance, etc. while airbnb's don't. That is a huge input cost that i'm sure if airbnb's also had to pay the cost advantage would dry up.

They are not forced and like the article stated, they'll probably leave alltogether. It's a great article that hightlights both side and I think it's sad you focused only on one

&gt;Yeah they were winning the war because of their industrial scale massacres.

Well I mean the algerian marxists resorted to terrorism as well and of course the French military was just way better equipped

&gt;Also,no Frenchmen answered in international court of justice for this.

I know and it's disgusting. Western imperialism, even in recent history showed that the international court does not have much power. Same for non-western countries like Turkey, China, India or Syria for example

&gt;You are not removing religious symbols from public institutions,you are banning tax paying religious people from wearing clothes they want in institutions they finance

But not only they finance those institutions, others do too and if the majority rather wants public space to be non-religious, I don't see an issue with it


&gt;Also France banned Turkish language course under the pretext of ""foreign interference"".Not a peep from this sub.

Well Germany has caught teachers and imams sent by turkey to spy on Germans, to interfe and to radicalize people, starting in kindergarten, which is why turkish imams have been banned here. If they do the same in France I don't see an issue with getting rid of such programs. My friend went to a Turkish-German school, but even though it is meant to teach both cultures they had to follow Turkish/muslim customs (like girls not being allowed to eat together with boys) and even in German classes they were not allowed to speak German

&gt;Imagine what would happen if Turkey banned Hebrew for example under the same pretext.

Doesn't Turkey de-facto oppress the kurdish language?

&gt;Yeah I agree human rights are better in France then in Turkey,but I do not see how does that matter?

I just said the reason for critcizing Turkey is nit because they took Istanbul, but rather because of the human right situation there and because their government and their supporters here cause a lot of issues, which annoy many people. You started comparing the two countries, not me

&gt;France is literally supporting a gang leader in Libya,who presided over industrial scale massacres,not seen for a long time in that area

4893,"&gt;It is a budget outline (or ceiling really). It doesn't define what each country pays. It is not a ""promise"".

It actually does, also handles subsequent rebates derived from payments. Calling something a bird, does not make it a bird, and calling something an ""outline"" does not remove it's legal staying power.   

&gt; You need to do a bit more critical reading yourself mate. There is no outstanding promise. A50 ends all obligations anyway.

It doesn't. I imagine it's because you think reading international agreements is a creative interpretation exercise where you read ""The treaties cease to apply"" and you imagine how that might work. But, it's not ""the treaties"", it's ""the Treaties"", a specific term defined at the beginning of the document which lists the specific agreements cancelled. The MFF is not one of them.

Are you sure, that the nuclear energy lobby gives a balanced view on the science? The meat lobby will alsp tell you that meat is healthy and the animals are happy.

As a direct answer to the question 

&gt;	Nuclear waste is hazardous for tens of thousands of years. This clearly is unprecedented and poses a huge threat to our future generations

Why can't the UK get one of these ""great deals"" that we are missing out on? We are more aligned to the EU than Japan ever was!!

Or perhaps the EU / Japan is not a great deal?  In which case, perhaps we are better off out.

It's telling that EU fans shift their position depending on whether they want to bash the UK or not.  They have to bash the UK of course.  They can't admit their is an alternative.  Can the EU do good deals or can't it?

The south American deal that collapsed (unless things have changed) is a good example.  Small beef producing EU nations were concerned about the powerful s American beef industry wiping them out.  So the deal fell through.

It's tough getting a deal that works for all EU countries.  And if you don't get consensus, it would be horrific to force a deal on a country that didn't want it.  What a shocking affront to democracy.

&gt;Indeed, the example of China shows that **even an undemocratic state can be economically successful, which is a major challenge for our liberal democracies**.

In short, **we have not yet been able to furnish absolute proof that the liberal system is about to win the day**.

This is something that changed profoundly. In the past there was always the assured conviction, that only democracys can be succesfull and that even though a democracy might have flaws, you stick by that, because there is no better system.

And if you check ISIS's official website. ( i don't know if they still have one, but they had one in their prime), you would see ISIS's desire is to conquer Istanbul to take the title of Khalifa. Of course Turkey abandoned the position of Khalifa in 1924 and become secular. In fact Turkey is the only country which is secular in all islamic world.  But in Islamic traditions, you have to defeat the current holder of the title in order to take it for yourself. So what you are saying doesn't make any sense at all.

5205,"&gt;The investigation found conclusive physical evidence (as per the wreckage recovered) that a bomb had indeed exploded mid-flight in the rear lavatory. A large section of the aircraft's fuselage around the lavatory was never recovered (presumably having disintegrated in the explosion). A test explosion in a DC-9 lavatory showed the resulting deformation in the surrounding structure to be almost identical to that of the incident aircraft.

&gt;From “A Case History Involving Wreckage Analysis: Lessons from the Ustica investigations”

&gt;4 Investigation Findings

&gt;4.1 It was concluded that the accident was brought about by in-flight break- up resulting from extensive structural damage caused by the detonation of an explosive charge in the rear (starboard) toilet.

&gt;4.2 The charge was probably located in the outer wall of the toilet although other nearby positions cannot be ruled out.

&gt;4.3 For the preferred position the charge would most probably have been inserted via the tissue holder just forward of station 801 and pushed rearwards to lie to the rear of the frame at station 801 and at a height at or just above the lower skin of the adjacent engine pylon.

&gt;4.4 Other less likely but possible and accessible positions include either inside the toilet waste tank, via the waste hole, or on top of it, via the cupboard under the wash basin.[12]

&gt;However, the Italian high courts dismissed this final report as insignificant to their own investigation, and the report was never considered.

A few good links that explain what happened. 

&gt;U.S. shot down the plane?

It's unknown who shot down the plane, the 3 main suspects are the France, U.S. and even the Italian Air Force. Everything is in the links.

&gt;or even a rational reason why, it was done on purpose?

The plane wasn't shot down intentionally. It is suspected that in the skies of the Tyrrhenian Sea, a dogfight between NATO fighters and Libyan Migs  broken out and that the airliner happened to be in the middle, being shot down by mistake. Then both Italian and other NATO countries secret services covered up the incident (missing documents ecc ecc). 

A few interesting quotes from the articles I linked:

_At last, after 32 years and seven months, the Italian Supreme Court of Cassation said that the plane crash was caused by a missile in a “war-like-scenario""_

_The role of Italian Air Force personnel in the tragedy is unclear. Several Air Force officials have been investigated and brought to court for a number of alleged offences, including falsification of documents, perjury, abuse of office and aiding and abetting. Four generals were charged with high treason_

_The media also reported that radar monitoring released in 1997 by NATO showed that at least seven fighter aircraft were in the vicinity when the jet plunged into the sea off the island of Ustica_


I hope this makes everything clearer!  Ustica massacre is a very delicate topic in Italy, many consider it the greatest Italian mystery, especially given the numerous attempts to sabotage the investigations that took place.",,/r/europe/comments/hgdok5/40_years_the_itavia_flight_870_crushed_in_the_sea/fw4gy1m/,_Zolfo_,1593220762

Further, in developed markets increasing the number of slots or expanding the number of runways is often very difficult, so you can't just crank out more WB and NB planes.

We voted to leave a political union that everyone can admit, if they remove the hurt feelings and heat, was not a good fit for either side.

We had a fundamentally different belief on what the future of the EU should be. Our vision is not bad or evil, it is not any better or worse than the one say France has. It’s just different.

And the writing has been on the wall for awhile now that the vision we had was a minority opinion. So we either had to let our vision die and leave, or stubbornly persist in trying to force it and hold back everyone else.

There are 20 million Kurds in Turkey 15% of the Turkish population basically. Majority of those Kurds live in the Kurdish parts of Turkey, which is the mostly south east areas. We Kurds call it Bakur. We have a right to speak our mother tongue, just like you do. Road markings are there for safety and to ensure people understand it, you write it in the language of the people living there. Kurds have existed there for thousands of years, longer than the existence of ""Turkey"" and the ""Turkish language"". So it's respectful that if you are forcing them to be part of Turkey you at least respect their language and let them read their mother tongue in their areas. It's only fair.

I am from Bakur, I am Kurdish and I want my homelands to stop being Turkified. It has already been bombed, burned, destroyed and terrorized for decades now. But the least younger generation Turks can do is be civilized and agree at least to not carry on destroying our language or culture, yet you repeat the past terror and think we are attacking you.

&gt; We start ""The News"" with one of the most bizarre judgments in the history of the Polish judiciary. TVP is to publish a correction to the incomplete information, which we completed and presented by ourselves on air 7 days ago, so decided by the Warsaw court.

Now it switches to text. 

&gt; Here is the content of the correction, published in a font whose size and cut was ordered by the court.

(yes, the quoted part is read by the Narrator. They're that commited to show how not sorry they are.)

Then the text is read; its about them not showing poll results of a (admittedly pretty fringe) party.

Pride isn't limited to oneself, I have no idea why so many people on reddit don't seem to get this.

5720,"&gt;Who are you quoting?

Nobody specific. But that's the point of view that you often hear that's giving islam a free pass when it comes to FGM.

----


I'm not sure the HRC quote is saying that FGM has nothing to do with islam. Except maybe the ""erroneusly linked to religion"". Are they saying that it's not exclusive to or originated with some religion? Sure that's true. But it's not ""erroneusly linked to religion"" in the sense that it's promoted and associated with some religions. E.g shafi'i sunni islam. That's basically the reason for why it's in SE-Asia.  

I'm not sure how the WHO quote is relevant. What do religious scripts have to do with this?  (And the WHO is simply wrong. I know that an authoratative text among the Dawoodi Bohra muslims prescribes the practice. And some sunni muslims consider it to be prescribed in some hadiths.) And they say that religious leaders take varying positions towards FGM. 

So it's clearly has something to do with islam. Like you have huge islamic religious groups saying that it's part of their religion. Saying that it's ""just culture"" is giving islam free pass.

And I don't see what you think that's contrary to what I said in tat academic paper.

Your argument is the same BS I hear about how we need to focus on female homelessness before male even though the vast majority of homeless are men. 

The long and short of it is that you must value male bodily autonomy less than female bodily autonomy to make these arguments and that’s just wrong.

This is an untrue claim. As per the exact wording of the WHO's 2018 report: *""partial or total removal of the clitoris (a small, sensitive and erectile part of the female genitals) and,* ***in very rare cases****, only the prepuce (the fold of skin surrounding the clitoris)""*.

The most common type of FGM by far is type Ib, the removal of the clitoral glans. Also referred to as clitoridectomy. 
The male equivalent to this would obviously be the removal of the penile glans, which is by no means widely practiced.

5802,"&gt;These issues have to be addressed, but they are being adressed indirectly. What do you want the left to say? Honour killings bad? Sexism bad? Homophobia bad? What makes you think that all these key points of the progressive platform are not adressed at muslims?

There are problems like incestious marriages, honor killings and forced marriages that are in Western  Europe specific to muslim communities, that have to be addressed specifically to these communities, because they only exist within these communities. But I guess you shouldn't specifically do something against systemic racism in the police, because saying racism is bad to all people is enough apparently and you don't need to call out specific groups. 

&gt;The right wants to attack this problem by attacking Islam itself

Yes the problems of incestuous marriages, honor killings etc. have to do with the religion and culture of muslims. They justify their intolerance largely by quotes from the Quaran and the Sharia. What do you think there are no reasons why honor killings only occur in muslim communities? There is a clear cultural link. So does that mean we should ban Islam and ban all muslims? No! But we still need to accept that these problems are rooted in their culture and religion and that we need to change that culture to be modern and progressive. Muslims can still practice their religion just not the hateful stuff,
just how christians needed to modernise their culture and religion in Europe to be modern and progressive.

&gt;All of these issues are solved through policy, supporting immigrant youth in schools, giving them after school programs, giving instructional lectures on homosexuality sexism etc. 

Ah and where are these programs applied in muslim areas? Muslims schools in England just rejected LGBTQ programs, because they don't want their children ""indoctrinated"" with the ""LGBTQ Agenda"". 

&gt;And that works, often second generations following immigrants are a lot less fundemental.

Yeah, I'm pretty sure you don't have any muslim friends or interacted with a lot of muslims. Second and third generationalists are often far more radical than their parents. They are often culturally torn between Europe and their country of origin. What age do you think all those islamist fighters, terrorists etc. are? They are all  second/third generation young men. I personally grew up with all lot of muslim friends I know that many of them are very friendly people, but to denie that there are huge issues within  muslim communities is insane. Saying their is a lot of great muslims but also far to many islamist in muslim communities are not mutually exclusive.

&gt;You generally don't protest other communities, you protest against the government. When the left is annoyed at white old men, it's not random white old men, it's white old men in the government. It would be extremely weird and worrying if people started to protest against muslim communities, imagine replacing muslim community with literally any other community.

No but you do specifically call out white people as a group or the police as a group, because of the actions of some, because their systemic and cultural issues within these groups. Doesn't mean all white people are racist, doesn't mean all police men are racist.

5824,"Trump launched his campaign in 2015 by calling Mexican immigrants “rapists” who are “bringing crime” and “bringing drugs” to the US. His campaign was largely built on building a wall to keep these immigrants out of the US.

As a candidate in 2015, Trump called for a ban on all Muslims coming into the US. His administration eventually implemented a significantly watered-down version of the policy.

When asked at a 2016 Republican debate whether all 1.6 billion Muslims hate the US, Trump said, “I mean a lot of them. I mean a lot of them.”

He argued in 2016 that Judge Gonzalo Curiel — who was overseeing the Trump University lawsuit — should recuse himself from the case because of his Mexican heritage and membership in a Latino lawyers association. House Speaker Paul Ryan, who endorsed Trump, later called such comments “the textbook definition of a racist comment.”

Trump has been repeatedly slow to condemn white supremacists who endorse him, and he regularly retweeted messages from white supremacists and neo-Nazis during his presidential campaign.

He tweeted and later deleted an image that showed Hillary Clinton in front of a pile of money and by a Jewish Star of David that said, “Most Corrupt Candidate Ever!” The tweet had some very obvious anti-Semitic imagery, but Trump insisted that the star was a sheriff’s badge, and said his campaign shouldn’t have deleted it.

Trump has repeatedly referred to Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) as “Pocahontas,” using her controversial — and later walked-back — claims to Native American heritage as a punchline.

At the 2016 Republican convention, Trump officially seized the mantle of the “law and order” candidate — an obvious dog whistle playing to white fears of Black crime, even though crime in the US is historically low. His speeches, comments, and executive actions after he took office have continued this line of messaging.

In a pitch to Black voters in 2016, Trump said, “You’re living in poverty, your schools are no good, you have no jobs, 58 percent of your youth is unemployed. What the hell do you have to lose?”

Trump stereotyped a Black reporter at a press conference in February 2017. When April Ryan asked him if he plans to meet and work with the Congressional Black Caucus, he repeatedly asked her to set up the meeting — even as she insisted that she’s “just a reporter.”

In the week after white supremacist protests in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017, Trump repeatedly said that “many sides” and “both sides” were to blame for the violence and chaos that ensued — suggesting that the white supremacist protesters were morally equivalent to counterprotesters who stood against racism. He also said that there were “some very fine people” among the white supremacists. All of this seemed like a dog whistle to white supremacists — and many of them took it as one, with white nationalist Richard Spencer praising Trump for “defending the truth.”

Throughout 2017, Trump repeatedly attacked NFL players who, by kneeling or otherwise silently protesting during the national anthem, demonstrated against systemic racism in America.

Trump reportedly said in 2017 that people who came to the US from Haiti “all have AIDS,” and he lamented that people who came to the US from Nigeria would never “go back to their huts” once they saw America. The White House denied that Trump ever made these comments.

Speaking about immigration in a bipartisan meeting in January 2018, Trump reportedly asked, in reference to Haiti and African countries, “Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?” He then reportedly suggested that the US should take more people from countries like Norway. The implication: Immigrants from predominantly white countries are good, while immigrants from predominantly Black countries are bad.

Trump denied making the “shithole” comments, although some senators present at the meeting said they happened. The White House, meanwhile, suggested that the comments, like Trump’s remarks about the NFL protests, will play well to his base. The only connection between Trump’s remarks about the NFL protests and his “shithole” comments is race.

Trump mocked Elizabeth Warren’s presidential campaign, again calling her “Pocahontas” in a tweet before adding, “See you on the campaign TRAIL, Liz!” The capitalized “TRAIL” is seemingly a reference to the Trail of Tears — a horrific act of ethnic cleansing in the 19th century in which Native Americans were forcibly relocated, causing thousands of deaths.

Trump tweeted that several Black and brown members of Congress — Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Ayanna Pressley (D-MA), Ilhan Omar (D-MN), and Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) — are “from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe” and that they should “go back” to those countries. It’s a common racist trope to say that Black and brown people, particularly immigrants, should go back to their countries of origin. Three of the four members of Congress whom Trump targeted were born in the US.

Trump has called the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus the “Chinese virus” and “kung flu.” The World Health Organization advises against linking a virus to any particular region, since it can lead to stigma. Trump’s adviser, Kellyanne Conway, previously described the term “kung flu” as “highly offensive.” Meanwhile, Asian Americans have reported hateful incidents targeting them due to the spread of the coronavirus.",,/r/europe/comments/hg5ddl/pompeo_says_us_ready_to_team_up_on_china_but_eu/fw2gqtm/,Kneckbert,1593183625

On the first point, because FGM tends to be talked about more, it seems like this is the only chance for advocates against MGM to speak and be heard, so that's probably why they coincide so often.

On the second, even when I was doing an unrelated search about the statistics of one vs the other, all the top articles listed by major publishers stated their own opinions on how one is worse than the other and the other group should keep quiet in relation to that fact. 

It appears as though that's a common mantra and, I think, more often than not, maybe due to cognitive dissonance or denial, men can be forced into keeping quiet or are brushed off when attempting to speak up or voice concerns regarding this or other issues. At any rate, there's no reason to assume that is an issue specific to one group disparaging another, and I feel people should otherwise be okay with having a healthy discussion on the matters with each other.

In 1897, the scholar Matteo Bartoli, himself a native of nearby Istria, visited Tuone Udaina (Italian: Antonio Udina), the last speaker of any Dalmatian dialect, to study his language, writing down approximately 2,800 words, stories, and accounts of his life, which were published in a book that has provided much information on the vocabulary, phonology, and grammar of the language. Bartoli wrote in Italian and published a translation in German (Das Dalmatische) in 1906 although i have no idea where you can buy it.

Just one year later, on 10 June 1898, Tuone Udaina was accidentally killed at 74 in a roadwork explosion.",🇸🇮/🇭🇷,/r/europe/comments/hg94ox/dalmatian_dialects_of_an_extinct_dalmatian/fw2gxu1/,CrystalMaterelius,1593183725

They think it will stay cleaner that way and prevent the children from getting STDs, as if condoms were not invented yet. By this same token those African cultures believe that FGM is just a way for a girl to be less horny (which is frown upon) and more satisfactory for a future husband.

5921,"Sure, but basing policy on the colour of someone's skin is the sort of nonsense we should strive to keep on the other side of the Atlantic. Additionally, as people with darker skin is far from a culturally homogenous group and there are many countries where we might get immigrants from where FGM is not prevalent, e.g. Brazil, that wording would be divisive and unfair. Thus either asylum seekers, who are commonly from countries where it is practised, or by country sounds like the best practise to me.

That argument can be used for any sort of abuse of children, by natives as well as immigrants. If a Norwegian girl is beaten up then we can only take her from her family after, and we will have to wonder about taking the other kids, and if 20 000 other Norwegian girls are beaten up then they should not be forced to live with their abusers either. It's not like immigrants would not be aware of the policy either. Let them know during the obligatory integration courses. If that doesn't make them aware, rumours will. Then they have a choice.

5936,"Tbh I think it’s the same for the U.K. Britain was mostly a small island on the edge of nowhere. It did not have the prestige or markets or artwork or wealth of France, Spain or the Netherlands. Indeed, the golden age of the Netherlands and early growth of the Dutch empire predated the rise of the British Empire. The traditional British narrative of empire (and indeed, for most early modern and modern history) is being a small, plucky “underdog” without the historic riches of some European nations, who managed to become wealthy through their own ingenuity (e.g the industrial revolution, trade) and the weaknesses/corruptions of other kingdoms and places they colonised. Often Britain is perceived as standing alone - but intact - against e.g Napoleon, the Axis etc, as having done good for a small island nation and having an outsized influence on the world. It’s a core reason for people who are proud of the empire. Of course this relies on selective memory (forgetting important allies, ignorance of history, handily ignoring multiple genocides, slavery etc etc).   But many Brits really love the idea of the underdog succeeding, and for many of them it’s their own national history which exemplifies that. Many within Britain also feel that about their own smaller national histories e.g some Scots are proud about the outsized role Scotland played in British imperial history, and there’s definitely the notion that for a small country, Scotland became important and wealthy having been an underdog (and narratives of colonialism over Scotland etc are brought into this, with England being one of the big countries scotland succeeded despite of). 

It fits even with the idea of settler colonialism - unlike the much focused on destruction of great kingdoms in Latin America and genocides etc/the black legend, British narratives of North America and Australia  have traditionally focused on the idea of a few hardy settlers in a mostly empty land who only engaged in warfare with the indigenous people when the natives started it, who were, again, plucky underdogs who shouldn’t have survived in harsh conditions but did because they were inherently hardy, tough and innovative. 

None of this is true of course, it ignores the many communities British settlers interacted with, depended on and then slaughtered. But I do think it is true of both Britain and the Netherlands that both perceive them/ourselves as having been David’s in a world of pushy, large (Catholic? I think that significantly influenced Britain’s idea of difference from and vulnerability to many other major European nations such as France and Spain after all) Goliath’s.",,/r/europe/comments/hg155x/how_unique_are_british_attitudes_to_empire/fw23z9w/,coldgreenrapunzel,1593176479

5969,"&gt; Sexism is the discrimination of a person based on their sex. If you write a law that targets FGM but either implicitly or explicitly allows MGM (or the other way around), you are allowing people of the other sex to be mutilated as children (i.e. negatively discriminated against). Such a law is inherently sexist.

This is the kind of argument that makes sense in the abstract but falls apart when you try to apply it to the real world. I can come up with several non-sexist reasons to oppose FGM and not circumcision - none of which I agree with, clearly, but such as:

- Female genital mutilation causes more damage to  the child than male circumcision - the objection is not to the mere act of violating a child without their consent, but to the severity of the mutilation

- Circumcision is an important religious practice, whereas FGM is merely cultural. We must respect religious freedom.

- FGM is more dangerous as it is usually practised by local elders. Circumcision is normally performed by licensed physicians.

&gt;Both true, but good things are seldom easy to achieve. That doesn't mean we should give up trying.

I never said we should give up trying, I just think coupling them together is terrible strategically.

&gt;I know and quite frankly, my opinion is this: The practitioners of these religions can either adapt to do it when a person reaches adulthood (and can consent), or they can fuck off. It's not like other religions haven't also practized similar abhorrent things in the past, but *eventually* evolved past that.

It's all well and good to say that - I agree with each and every word of it. I'm an atheist, and if it were up to me all kinds of religious indoctrination of children would be banned.

But it's not up to me. And it's not up to you either. To just say ""well these religious people can either adapt or fuck off"" might as well be screaming into the void, because these religious people make up a substantial portion of the world's population and hold a large amount of power.

&gt;I can, in theory, sympathize with allying with the lesser of two evils in order to fight the greater one. 

You're not ""allying with"" circumcision, though. With people who support it sure.


&gt;But there simply are some things you just don't do if you want to be able to look yourself in the mirror: One of them is support people who mutilate children (a bit) in order to fight people who mutilate children (a lot).

Well personally I won't let perfect be the enemy of the good, and wouldn't be able to look at myself in the mirror if I sabotaged the fight against FGM by attaching it to a much less severe - but still important - issue.",,/r/europe/comments/hg38f5/female_genital_mutilation_report_shows_68000/fw244tt/,xe3to,1593176578

That always matters from a legal perspective. You will receive a higher sentence from beating up someome than from punching someone, although both are bad. FGM is worse than circumcision. If the form of MGM practiced would have the cutting of the whole penis off, people would have said it is just as bad as the FGM where the clitoris is cutt of and the vagina is stiched together.

&gt;People talk about MGM because young boys are still not protected by law from genital mutilation in many countries, unlike girls who are.

Civil rights activists? What about the current BLM protestors? All engaged in ‘criminal’ behaviour for their time. 

You could argue that they all fall under the definition of terrorists, but the point is they’re taking personal risks to try and improve the lives of those who cannot speak out. We’ve learnt nothing changes throughout human history without ‘crime’ and ‘civil disobedience’ to force the change. You could push it further and say they’re risking their own lives to try and and save your life, the lives of any family you may have, and even the planet (extreme I know, but all the smart and qualified people agree it is happening fast and unless things change you can say goodbye to any quality of life for future generations).

5999,"The word conservative is not one I use lightly. Most rightwing people in my country I would not consider conservative. If you believe in equal rights, gay acceptance and women's rights I wouldn't call you a conservative quickly, in my mind you would be more of a anti-immigration liberal. Mind you that my use of ""women not working again"" was a bit hyperbolic, but ultimately that is the goal of conservatism, to go back to the way things are. 


 In my country we have the progressive left, the center-right liberals and 3 parties I would consider actually conservative. One of which says nothing about women issues so I will ignore that one, the other two have spoken about women's rights in a negative fashion. If you vote for those two parties because of immigration policy I have to assume you hate muslims more than you value women their rights.",,/r/europe/comments/hg38f5/female_genital_mutilation_report_shows_68000/fw24ay8/,yousoc,1593176688
