 [""I am a doughnut"" urban legend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ich_bin_ein_Berliner#""I_am_a_doughnut""_urban_legend) 
 
 &gt;There is a widespread false belief that Kennedy made an embarrassing mistake by saying Ich bin ein Berliner. By not leaving out the indefinite article ""ein,"" he supposedly changed the meaning of the sentence from the intended ""I am a citizen of Berlin"" to ""I am a Berliner"" (a Berliner being a type of German pastry, similar to a jelly doughnut), amusing Germans throughout the city. While the phrase ""Ich bin ein Berliner"" can be understood as having a double meaning, it is neither wrong to use it the way Kennedy did nor was it embarrassing.

76,"PARIS — Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken, speaking in an interview after a meeting with President Emmanuel Macron of France, said the United States and France were “on the same page” in their determination to resist the possibility of a Chinese-led world order that would be “profoundly illiberal in nature.”

On his first visit as secretary to France, where he lived for nine years in his youth and attended high school, Mr. Blinken said “our purpose is not to contain China” or “try to hold China back.” But when it comes to defending a free and open international order, “we will stand up.”

The alternative, he suggested, was either no order — a world of chaos that “inevitably leads to conflict and that almost inevitably brings us in” — or Chinese domination. The challenge for democracies was “to deliver for their people and hopefully for people around the world” in order to reinforce a model challenged in recent years by its own internal fractures and by rising autocracies.

“And I found that President Macron was thinking in exactly the same way and focused on the need to bring practical results,” Mr. Blinken said.

Mr. Blinken’s pleasure at being back in France was evident. At a meeting earlier in the day, France’s foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, greeted the secretary as “My dear Tony” and said, “Welcome home.”

Asked about this, Mr. Blinken said, “Oh yes, it is a sacred home for me. I was here from age 9 to 18. I had a life-changing experience.”

Having said Thursday in Berlin that the United States has “no better friend in the world than Germany,” he said he would say the same thing about France. As he turned to the foundations of America’s oldest alliance, Mr. Blinken’s emotion was evident.

“It comes down to something pretty basic,” he said. “You know, we throw out a lot of words and we just kind of say them by rote. But at our best, our countries have worked to actually give meaning to liberty, equality, fraternity. They’ve tried to give meaning to freedom of speech. They’ve tried to give meaning to human rights. They’ve tried to give meaning to democracy.”

He continued: “And ultimately — obviously there are differences of culture, of history, of so many things — but when it comes to a basic set of shared values, there are few countries that are closer.”

This amounted to a deeply felt personal call for France and the United States to renew their bond by standing together at a time of challenges, from the coronavirus pandemic to the rise of China, that present “an imperative for cooperation, for coordination, for working together,” in Mr. Blinken’s words.

Nevertheless, the convergence of American and French views was a little surprising in that Mr. Macron has made several remarks recently insisting on the importance of Europe’s strategic autonomy.

Former President Donald J. Trump disparaged traditional alliances, started trade wars and resisted confronting Russian aggression. U.S. allies have expressed relief that President Biden has turned American foreign policy back in more familiar directions, but their experience with Mr. Trump left them warier than ever of following Washington’s lead.

Mr. Macron has appeared more conciliatory than the United States toward China and has insisted that Europe be at the table in arms control negotiations between the United States and Russia.

On the eve of the Group of 7 and NATO meetings earlier this month, Mr. Macron said: “Unless my map has a problem, China is not part of the geography of the Atlantic” — a clear jab at NATO confronting China.

Such Gaullist assertions of independent French strategy tend to play well here, and Mr. Macron plans to run for re-election next year. In the end, France joined the other large, wealthy democracies at the G7 in making clear that they saw China and Russia as repressive and aggressive ideological rivals, and other NATO members in saying China presents “systemic challenges” to “areas relevant to military security.”

China’s Belt and Road Initiative has built roads, ports, railways and communications networks across Africa and elsewhere, expanding Beijing’s economic and security influence with the countries that sign on, leaving them beholden and often deeply indebted.

Turning to the Biden administration’s attempt to counter China’s strategy through a “Build Back Better for the World” program, dubbed B3W, Mr. Blinken made clear in the interview which he thinks the better option is for low and middle-income countries.

“We’re offering something positive and affirmative,” he said. “It so happens that what China is offering is not so positive and not so affirmative. Well, I think the contrast is clear.”

With China, he said, “there are always strings attached,” including “the use of vaccines as a coercive tool with other countries.” The West, by contrast, was pledging one billion vaccine doses to end the pandemic “with no political strings.”

After six rounds of nuclear talks with Tehran and no agreement to revive the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which Mr. Trump abandoned, Mr. Blinken said that the progress of Iran’s nuclear program could become an insurmountable obstacle.

“If this continues, if they continue to spin more sophisticated centrifuges at higher and higher levels, we will get to a point where it will be very difficult as a practical matter” to return to the parameters of the original nuclear deal, he said.

“I can’t put a date on it,” Mr. Blinken said of the day when the Biden administration might walk away from the nuclear talks, but “it’s getting closer.”

During a news conference earlier in the day with Mr. Le Drian, Mr. Blinken warned that “serious differences” persist with Tehran over its nuclear program but that preventing an Iranian nuclear weapons capability remains in the American national interest.

Of his planned meeting next week in Italy with the new Israeli foreign minister, Yair Lapid, Mr. Blinken said one aim was to “try to rebuild a little bit more trust and confidence between Israelis and Palestinians so that at some point the conditions may exist to actually to move forward again on negotiations, on a lasting peace.”

The Biden administration strongly supported the Abraham Accords, concluded under the Trump Administration, normalizing Israel’s relations with four Arab states, Mr. Blinken said.

Referring to Israel’s recent war with Hamas in Gaza, as well as clashes in Israel and the occupied West Bank, he added, “But we also know — and I think we’ve just seen evidence of that — that they are not a substitute for dealing with the Israeli-Palestinian issue.”",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/o86n0h/france_and_us_agree_on_the_perils_of_a_rising/h335wib/,usmilitarythrowaway1,1624695351

269,"The Treaty of Nanking (Nanjing) was a peace treaty which ended the First Opium War (1839–1842) between the United Kingdom and China on 29 August 1842. It was the first of what the Chinese later called the *unequal treaties*.  
  
In the wake of China's military defeat, with British warships poised to attack Nanking, British and Chinese officials negotiated on board HMS Cornwallis anchored at the city. On 29 August, British representative Sir Henry Pottinger and Qing representatives signed the treaty, which consisted of thirteen articles. 

The treaty was ratified by the Daoguang Emperor on 27 October and Queen Victoria on 28 December. Ratification was exchanged in Hong Kong on 26 June 1843. A copy of the treaty is kept by the British government while another copy is kept by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Republic of China.

Hong Kong is a special administrative region of China, located to the east of the Pearl River (Zhu Jiang) estuary on the south coast of China. The region is bordered by Guangdong province to the north and the South China Sea to the east, south, and west. 

It consists of Hong Kong Island, originally ceded by China to Great Britain in 1842, the southern part of the Kowloon Peninsula and Stonecutters (Ngong Shuen) Island (now joined to the mainland), ceded in 1860, and the New Territories, which include the mainland area lying largely to the north, together with 230 large and small offshore islands—all of which were leased from China for 99 years from 1898 to 1997.

The area of Hong Kong has expanded over the years, and it has continued to grow as more land has been reclaimed from the surrounding sea. Hong Kong Island and its adjacent islets have an area of only about 81 square km, while urban Kowloon, which includes the Kowloon Peninsula south of Boundary Street, and Stonecutters Island measure about 47 square km. 

The New Territories account for the rest of the area—more than 90 percent of the total. The Victoria urban district located on the barren rocks of the northwestern coast of Hong Kong Island is the place where the British first landed in 1841, and it has since been the centre of administrative and economic activities.

The Chinese-British joint declaration signed on December 19, 1984, paved the way for the entire territory to be returned to China, which occurred July 1, 1997.",,/r/europe/comments/o83z2b/26_june_1843_treaty_of_nanking_comes_into_effect/h32r8ti/,Vucea,1624682860

Here is the thing. Our senior diplomats are largely graduates of MGIMO. So perhaps France and Germany should pay mind when they speak.

Russia draws lines as far as its allowed. Simple. If it can invade Ukraine, it will invade Ukraine. They will push boundries as far as they can, because they can. Because they bank on Western Europe always going for compromise and middle ground and thus their starting point has to be as far as possible and they take zero issues with using military power to do so. In fact, its their primary way of doing international relationships. Really, nothing difficult to understand.

You know why their agents run around doing assassination missions across Europe? Because fuck all happens to them when they do. What? You will issue a firm statement and then expell some GRU operatives from embassies? Think they care? Most of their staff there is GRU, few here or there dont do shit to their operational capacities.

And look at this. Russia made zero steps to get closer to Europe. Nothing. They didnt withdraw from anywhere, made no step back.

591,"I translated [an article from a local's blog](https://www.vidlakovykydy.cz/clanky/vybrala-si-spatne-misto). He has a rather optimistic outlook, and I thought it might be interesting to read a comment from someone who doesn't try to sensationalize the whole thing. Here it is:

*She picked the wrong place* (by Vidlak, 25. 06. 2021)

I'll start with an incident yesterday that I would not have considered otherwise...  It was awfully stuffy yesterday. Absolutely awful. Temperatures over 30 degrees, not a leaf moved and we were putting one of the last chambers of last year's grain in the silo. The grain in the chamber is cooled in the winter, and because the grain has pretty good insulating properties, the kernels are still about 15°C today.  We started the conveyors and after ten minutes the water started gushing out of them at the bottom. The grain was cold enough to cool the elevator plates by a few degrees and water started to condense on them. 

My elder colleague walked around worriedly and told us to secure everything at home, to open the drains, because something awful was coming. Dew on machinery in the silos, that's not strange - in March. The last time it happened at this time of year, the floods came to Moravia. We younger ones were just smiling. All our weather apps were predicting a light shower that probably wouldn't even reach us, but he insisted. 

He was right. 

The catastrophe avoided Vidlákov - the storm still split into two branches over Austria. One went from Znojmo to Trebic and the other went from Znojmo to Breclav. Vidlákov was in the middle, so there was a lot of lightning, but there was almost no wind and a pleasant 15mm of rain fell. Nothing unusual. Pálava saved us. A lot of storms split over there and we usually grumble about it because we get a rain shadow and while it's raining all around, we're dry. I'll never grumble about it again. 

The storm went over Breclav, and where those fertile floodplains of the Morava River start, that's where it happened. Hot air full of water vapor, or a bunch of energy, heated hot ground under the vineyards, a wide plain and a sharp drop in air pressure. Everything you need for a tornado came together. In the village of Hrušky it had the force of maybe even an F4, because it tore down the outer walls of the houses there. The tornado then basically passed through the Hrušky - Moravská Nová Ves road and ended up in the forest near Hodonín, where it exploded. It looks like a Hollywood movie.

A colleague from work this morning told me how he watched the tornado from the window of a block of flats in Hodonín. Terrible roar, terrible sound, and then the power went out. They went to sleep and didn't know what happened. In the morning he had a text message on his phone saying that tigers had escaped from the zoo in Hodonín, so it was better not to go outside. Actually, we don't even know if the tigers actually escaped. 

My colleague couldn't get into the garage this morning because some stranger's roof was parked outside. He ended up taking a friend's car and driving to work... woods shaved like Verdun, shipping containers and truck trailers piled up in the woods. Not tipped over, but picked up and thrown into the trees. Debris everywhere, pieces of everything. When Malinovsky was pushing the last German groups towards Prague, he didn't do that much damage. 

I was just going to describe the situation dryly, but my article today will be about something else. It won't be about how small we are against nature, but about the fact that we will win anyway. It will be about what happens now that the storm is over. Because this time, nature has missed the mark with her disaster. 

This time, it didn't hit some troubled neighborhoods like in New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina. Haiti wasn't hit, Chánov wasn't hit... this time the storm hit a place that has been continuously settled since the Premyslids. It hit a place where people have lived on their own for hundreds of years. It hit an orderly rural landscape full of pretty streets, stacked houses, where everyone has a job, everyone has land, everyone is hard-working and friendly, and generally debt-free.  

Even in the evening, Facebook was overflowing with offers of accommodation. We all have pretty substantial lists of friends (and relatives) here, so it wasn't even an hour after the first instagram photos were posted and the offer was catching up. From Moravské Budějovice to Zlín. 

By six in the morning, the radio was already reporting that ten twenty-forty million crowns had already been raised overnight to help those affected. Then came a plea for people to stop offering help through the emergency hotlines. The operations call centres were overloaded not with requests for help, but with offers of help. Another colleague who drove by in the morning reported that there were long lines of cars with carts and shovels at the roadblocks. In the affected villages all the garden tractors, small tractors, mowers, old zetors, everything is already working hard. 

I have noticed a number of local craftsmen - bricklayers and carpenters, declining the orders that have been contracted but not yet started, because many roofs will need to be fixed, so do not be angry, but the roof replacement will wait this year, priority will be given to the houses in the affected villages. 

I myself encountered several fire engines with heavy equipment heading in that direction this morning. 

In short, when you hear some journalistic hyena gloating about how the government and the authorities have failed again, don't believe it. I saw a tornado for the first time in my life, but it was also the first time I saw such a huge force of humanity. No one will sit there with their hands in their lap, no one is afraid of work, and no one will be looting there either. 

All those villages there will rise from the rubble like a phoenix and be even more beautiful than before. As in all areas with such a long history of settlement, there were a lot of long-standing obstructing houses, loose corners, unresolved land boundaries. Lots of locals have been haggling with officials for years to build something or to tear something down. Now nobody's gonna ask any questions. Now permits will be granted quickly, easily and in bulk. The tornado saved a lot of paperwork for demolition and ended a lot of boundary line disputes. 

All it takes is a little money, because he who gives quickly, gives twice. Plus, people there have their properties properly insured because they take care of such things. Folks are much more willing to reach into their pockets to rebuild wine cellars and to contribute to fixing up alleys and little picturesque houses than to give to development projects somewhere far away that will be blown up by some Boko Haram. 

Today, of course, the locals have tears in their eyes at the devastation, but tomorrow there will be cement mixers and chainsaws whirring all over the place. In a few days, there will be a big pile of rubble on the edge of the village and the first barracks will have new roofing. In a few days, the main thing you'll see is determination in spite of nature and in spite of the disaster. The place will be swarming with workers, the women will be cooking proper lunches for the groups of people who come to help every weekend, the wrecked cars will be examined by the liquidators, but the tractors were built to last. There will be no problem lifting, moving and shifting loads. 

A year from now, people will have their little houses there, nicer than ever, and five years from now they'll be talking about how the tornado helped them decide to rebuild. They'll talk about how we're a great nation because they got helped by the insurance company, the municipality, the charity, and other organizations, and that it was enough for the new roof, and since they were already doing the roof and had to replace all the windows anyway, they also redesigned the layout of the entire house. The firemen and volunteers helped with the rubble, and a lot of things sort of happened on their own, and today they just remember how everyone pulled together and the whole country helped. 

So friends... don't worry about them over there. They're gonna do the best they can in this republic. Send them some money or go help them clean up. And next year, take a vacation there. They'll have it mostly fixed up and nicer than before.

648,"* **The Social Democratic/Nordic Model:**  
High taxes, high degree of income redistribution, high level of participation of women in the labour market, high standard of living and citizens with a high level of confidence in their public system (Denmark, Norway, Iceland, Finland and Sweden).
* **Conservative/Corporatist Model:**  
Low level of participation of women in the labour market, dependency on social contributions instead of on taxes, moderate redistribution of income and higher levels of unemployment, especially in the countries of the South of Europe. (Austria, Belgium, Germany, Greece, Italy, Malta, Cyprus, Turkey, Luxemburg, the Netherlands, Spain and Portugal)
* **Anglo-Saxon/Liberal Model:**  
Low level of total state spending, high level of inequality and low level of expenditure on social protection. (Switzerland, the United Kingdom and Ireland)
* **Model of the Former USSR:**  
Similar to the conservative model with respect to total state spending. The greatest differences lie in the quality of life and level of confidence in the public system (Belarus, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Russia and the Ukraine).
* **Model of Post-Communist Europe:**  
The quality of life is greater than in the previous group and the system is more egalitarian. On the other hand, they present more moderate levels of economic growth and inflation than in countries associated with the previous model. (Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia).
* **Welfare State models in a process of development:**  
This relates to countries that are still in the process of maturing their welfare states. Their programmes of state aid and indicators of quality of life are below those in the previously mentioned groups. Their high levels of infant mortality and low life expectancies reflect the difficult social situations found in these countries. (Georgia, Rumania and Moldavia).

710,"&gt; It could even be used by Russian propaganda to link gay rights with ""western imperialism"" which is of course stupid  

Dictators and oligarchs are going to use anything and everything for propaganda, because they're not true to their perceived ideals, they only use it as a weapon to get more power. Germans, of all people, should know this.  

&gt; But how does it help people on the ground? I guess the general social attitude in Russia won't change much when these embassies are flying a flag.  

Every little bit helps.  
There's rarely one single individual that acts for the benefit of an oppressed group and actually manages to implement change.  
Usually societal change happens when a certain threshold is crossed, which in turn gets achieved by individual actions that build up on top of each other. Like grass root movements.

The property tax structure in Belgium has kept a lid on the burning hot housing market compared with the rest of the region, however of course housing has become more expensive and since the downpayment tax thing is given as a percentage of the property value, this tax is becoming a bit more prohibitive for first time buyers.

I personally hate it because it's really prohibitive for someone who plans on staying maybe 3-5 years. But for the country I believe it's been mainly positive. 

In Denmark the cost of entering the housing market is steep as in the rest of Europe. But at least the downpayment is not money directly into the taxmans pocket. But hey, if it works it works.

You deliberately misunderstand what I said and why they do this, the point isn't turn people gay but increase sensibility about fucking rights.

&gt; We will see. 

We're already seeing that.

&gt; Go back 10 years ago i wouldn't even think about hating someone based on his skin, or ""sexuality"" like there are more then 2 genders.

Genders and sexuality are two different things, don't confuse them.

And yes you would because that train of thought that doesn't suddenly prop up, if it wasn't gays it would be jews, other crhistians, neighbours who play music you don't like, other nationalities because you are xenophobic.

&gt; a way to attract more attention, 

Attracting attention in order to promote their rights yes and show the inegalities, the same way Martin Luther King did in the US for rights of people of colour but I don't hear you complaining about him (yet).

&gt; why aren't these gay people that feel so oppressed here pack up their shit and go protest in, as an example, pakistan?

They have no business not being in THEIR country, their romanians just like you although you do a good job dragging the reputation of your nationality through the mud.

&gt; Eazy, because they don't care about other people, they only create new problems so that they feel special.

I'm pretty sure you're against russian invasions, why aren't you in Ukraine fighting ?

1341,"By restore the system, do you mean after the hack?  That will take months and months and months to fully restore.

They have to decrypt the data, this is still happening and are about 75% done.

They need to get their servers patched to the latest versions that are supported, this will likely mean replacement hardware... at a time when there is a shortage of equipment.

They have to identify security flaws used, else will just be hacked again.  Secure any other issues as best they can identify.

With an insurance company, they have 2 classes of data, Red data potentially touched by the hackers.  Green stuff you know is okay (so basically nothing on the system).  
Red you have to scan everything with two or three different endpoints (virus checkers).  

A build server used to install OS on laptops and desktops could take a month or two to scan with millions of small files - probably best to start from scratch ... Could take you a couple of weeks, if you have perfect documentation, and a single image that works on all your kit.

They potentially have to restore from backups they have and scan the data.  I have zero idea how long that would take, I can't even estimate the size and time.  Good thing about modern backups is you can start using them as they start to restore but that scanning will hurt.

Now you have the real time consuming work.  

Update vulnerable software (saw story saying windows XP was in use - think of kit like MRI scanners, €500k bits of kit do you replace it?) and likely lots of computer hardware will need to be replaced as well.

Potentially have to rebuild every PC and Laptop, update every phone and tablet.  The issue will be the sheer variety of kit and software required.  They will likely have banned every device and as they rebuild or scan allow it back on the network.

All users will probably have to change passwords, setup multi factor authentication, have rights checked as well.

1426,"As a meteorologist and resident of the most tornado prone area on the planet (Oklahoma), it saddens me to hear people say ""there was no warning"" or ""it came out of nowhere"".  Tornadoes just don't happen  out of nowhere. The right ingredients came together and caused a predicable tragedy.  

We're spoiled with the amount of meteorological information and forecasts in America, yet people are still killed every year.  It is a communication problem. 

There was a very high risk of severe weather today as forecasted by the very smart meteorologists at [ESTOFEX](https://www.estofex.org/). This website gives you a map and brief overview of the severe weather threat over Europe. It goes into technical meteorological detail further down.  They don't put out a forecast every day, like the US's National Weather Service.  Tornadoes happen in Europe.  They aren't that rare.  Part of the reason why they seem rare is the lack of centralized, accurate, reports.  

The EU should have a central meteorological office just like the NWS. They need to issue convective (severe weather) outlooks like the storm prediction center. They need to have standardized warnings and watches for the entire continent. Forecasts and radar data should be freely available to the public. I understand that the language barrier is an issue, but this can be handled by standard phraseology for weather events, so the forecaster just needs to hit a button and it will automatically reach the proper audience in an understandable format.  

People have advanced way too far to be affected by predictable and mitigatable events. I hope someone can lead the EU, and the rest of Europe in adopting weather standards that will improve, and save, people's lives.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/o77ms6/aftermath_of_tornado_in_hodonín_czech_republic/h2ykb2r/,bugalaman,1624594407

This just sums up what the priorities are with the people in the EU machinery. It can't last with these people in there.

Also this is made 100x worse with UK leaving because now the balance between north and south is out of wack. UK would have silently vetoed the wealth transfer of the ""corona stimulus"".

Interesting, so the EU doesn't care about an objective view of democracy or human rights, just what the ""top members of the club"" subjectivly decide are human rights...

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Kind of how Poland and Hungary don’t want any migrants because they think they can’t assimilate?

Where I am from it is so common as to be treated lightly. If the changing climate causes your region to suffer more thunderstorms like this I recommend the following advice:

When funnels are spotted, stay indoors and in a basement if available. Tornadoes are strange. They can totally destroy a settlement and its buildings but leave everyone alive if only those people are underground or away from shrapnel forming materials.

Some buildings will be totally destroyed, some will be mercifully intact. Tornadoes do as they themselves Will, and all else is fortune.

1765,"To no-one's surprise.  
  
For a recap of events the United States Naval Institute news has a decent [article](https://news.usni.org/2021/06/23/u-k-mod-denies-russians-fired-warning-shots-dropped-bombs-near-warship-during-black-sea-transit), including an image showing the Traffic Separation Scheme that runs past Sevastopol inside territorial waters. Closest approach of HMS Defender was 10nm following this TSS, and the MoD confirms that Defender required no permission to do so as this was permitted innocent passage under Article 19 of the UNCLOS that Russian and the United Kingdom have both ratified (as has the People's Republic of China but *not* the United States of America, which merely observes the historic 3 mile limit of territorial waters).  
  
HMS Defender has been sailing in company with HNLMS Evertsen in the Black Sea area on detachment from HMS Queen Elizabeth's Carrier Strike Group 21. After sailing through the Bosporus on 14 June both ships met with USS Laboon (an Arleigh-Burke destroyer) and the three were shadowed by a Russian patrol ship of the 22160-class (tentatively identified as either RFS 363 Pavel Derzhavin or RFS 375 Dmitry Rogachev, for those interested) on 17 June in clearly international waters.  
  
On 18 June Defender and Evertsen docked safely in Odessa as planned. Overnight the Automated Identification System (AIS) data used for safe maritime navigation was [hacked](https://news.usni.org/2021/06/21/positions-of-two-nato-ships-were-falsified-near-russian-black-sea-naval-base) to show that Defender and Evertsen had sailed directly for a position 2 nautical miles outside the Russian Black Sea Fleet Headquarters at Sevastopol (!) However mark one eyeballs, and a live webcam feed in Odessa showed that both ships remained docked.  
  
On 19 June members of Defender's company accepted an invitation to pay respects at the Monument to Unknown Sailor, where they laid a wreathe to pay respects to all sailors who died in the defence and liberation of Odessa during the war. On 21 June Defender was conducting fire fighting and damage control training with the Navy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and hosted UK Minister for Defence Procurment and the Deputy Defence of Ukraine to sign a Memoranda of Implementation between Ukraine and the United Kingdom.

  
Defender and Evertsen left Odessa on the morning of 22 June heading for their next port of call in Georgia. Such a route requires navigating around the Crimean peninsular before a course correction can be made. The UK Secretary of State for Defence has issued a [statement](https://questions-statements.parliament.uk/written-statements/detail/2021-06-24/hcws122) detailing the British version of events that no violation of international maritime occurred that you can compare to the Russian Deputy Prime Minister.  
  
And if that sounds like I'm asking you to make a judgement between the two that's precisely the point of this. Both governments are not just playing to their home galley they are also playing to international opinion. The British are maintaining the narrative of upholding international law by acting professionally and within the UNCLOS treaty provisions. They are free to sail to within 12nm wherever they like, and can also exercise innocent passage through territorial waters without needing permission. The Russian over-reaction to this makes them lose face abroad because they are not respecting the treaty. But I suppose that too sends a more menacing message.  
  
TL;DR showing the world that the Black Sea is not a private Russian lake has been going on since forever. HMS Dragon in October 2020 got the [exact same treatment](https://www.forces.net/news/mod-denies-categorically-untrue-claims-hms-dragon-was-expelled-crimean-coast-russia) and HMS Duncan in 2018 was also buzzed by [17 Russian jets](https://theaviationist.com/2018/11/27/17-russian-combat-aircraft-buzzed-british-royal-navy-warship-hms-duncan-in-the-black-sea-near-crimea/) while approaching no closer than 30nm.

Friendly relations don't happen overnight, the EU exists now but only 70 years ago we were involved in WW2. Heck we are somewhat allied with Japan and they were truly beyond evil (and mostly don't recognize the crimes against humanity they committed). 

The main reason we remain at odds with Russia is we still consider them a potential enemy.

They may be more hostile, but they are *hostile in response to hostilities already*. 

It really depends on the two sides, but responding with civility, willingless to negotiate, forgiveness etc. to a hostility or transgression is seen as a weakness by a lot of countries, politicans and people in general.

Yes, we don't have leadership, we never had, look at our language we basically copy pasted french gave it a balkan twist and called it our own, our greatest statesman were firstly french/austrian/german educated, hell we had an union and in that union we decided that only a foreign prince of german/french/british could be the *true king*.

We are thankful for our place in the EU and in the same time we know our place, don't worry, no need to be **that** butthurt.

In a few decades we could do better, it's a work in progress for the next half a century, we could better and please you do the same as one can debate with another without becoming dismissive of one's ideas, even on internet and even on r/Europe, especially when one is offensive, rightfully or not.

Bering less of a twat, dose wonders.

Is my fellow Romanian right about Macron ? Well to be fair, he's not.

Macron is the president of France firstly and looking over r/France I know that he still has a tough game at home, he's not the president of EU at the same time EU Parliament and the Commission doesn't have a mandate on a lot of EU's position on foreign policy without the EU Parliament and European Council consent.

Why dose he probably thinks Macron he's an absolute zero ? Because at the moment Ursula lacks power as is the mandate and we see in Macron along Merkel are, rightfully or not, the true leaders of EU, which is factually correct, both holding the largest vote in the EU Parliament and the biggest economies. So when we don't see in Macron the powerhouse that's needed to fix the Eurozone by pushing the fiscal harmonisation with a debate and a mandate over Germany along the rest of the hot debates within the EU, makes one to draw conclusions.

One can't have debates over EU's army when the Eurozone is still a working a progress. Fixing the Eurozone would pave the way *more ~~power~~ representation* to be given the President of the EU Commission and people would back off in pointing fingers at French Presidents or German Chancellors.",Transylvania (Romania),/r/europe/comments/o6xkd6/merkel_says_eu_should_seek_direct_contact_with/h2wstjk/,Vargau,1624557758

There was plenty of violence in the fight to get civil rights back against whites. MLK was not the only activist and not everyone agreed with his passive approach. And it only got more and more violent toward the end of the movement because being purely passive was working nationally.

From the wiki page you linked.  


Between 1963 and 1964, civil rights activists got more angry and more   
likely to fight back against whites. In April 1964, Malcolm gave a   
famous speech called ""The Ballot or the Bullet.""  
 (""The ballot"" means ""voting."") In the speech, he said that if the U.S.   
government is ""unwilling or unable to defend the lives and the property   
of Negroes,"" then African Americans should defend themselves.\[80\]p. 43 He warned politicians that many African Americans were not willing ""to turn the other cheek any longer.""

And the Civil Rights Act of 1968 was signed BECAUSE it was the only way to stop rioting following King's death.

[https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil\_Rights\_Act\_of\_1968](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1968)

The Civil Rights Act of 1968 (Pub.L. 90-284, 82 Stat. 73, enacted April 11, 1968) is a landmark law in the United States signed into law by United States President Lyndon B.

2060,"European leaders clashed over a Franco-German initiative for an EU summit with Russian president Vladimir Putin, as critics warned against “free concessions” at a time of worsening relations with the Kremlin.

Ahead of an EU leaders’ meeting about the surprise Franco-German proposal, Krisjanis Karins, Latvia’s prime minister, warned against giving away too much to Putin, while Poland’s prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said dialogue should only happen if there was “actual de-escalation”.

Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, said any meeting with Putin should be limited to the presidents of the European Commission and European Council, rather than involving all member states. Gabrielius Landsbergis, the Lithuanian foreign minister, told the Financial Times the idea was “irresponsible” and a case of “historical myopia”.

Berlin and Paris wrongfooted their EU partners on Wednesday by floating their proposal on the eve of the leaders’ summit in Brussels. The Franco-German initiative followed last week’s meeting between US president Joe Biden and his Russian counterpart in Geneva, which was designed to stabilise deteriorating US-Russian relations.

Arriving for the EU summit on Thursday, Karins said he was “all for the dialogue” but that it must come at “a certain cost to Russia” given its actions including the 2014 annexation of Crimea and military incursions in eastern Ukraine.

“The Kremlin understands power politics,” Karins said. “The Kremlin does not understand free concessions as a sign of strength.”

EU summits with Russia have been suspended since the Crimea annexation. The last one took place in January 2014 between Putin and the then European Commission and European Council presidents.

Speaking in the Bundestag on Thursday, Germany’s chancellor Angela Merkel said the EU should seek “direct contact” with Russia in the same way that Biden did. “It isn’t enough when US president Joe Biden speaks to the Russian president,” she told German lawmakers. “I welcome it, but the EU must also create formats for dialogues. Otherwise, we won’t be able to solve conflicts.”

Emmanuel Macron, the French president, later said he hoped to have a “demanding and ambitious” dialogue with Russia, built upon a foundation of European co-ordination and unity, and insisted the EU could not remain purely reactive when dealing with Russia.

Merkel and Macron won support from Sebastian Kurz, the Austrian chancellor, who said on Wednesday he was “very happy there is movement towards dialogue with Russia”.

“We are closer to Russia geographically than the US, and the EU cannot simply watch as the US and Russia are having a dialogue,” said Kurz. “There are topics like the Ukraine that concern us more than the US.”

Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the Kremlin was “positive” about the proposal, and was watching for a sign of agreement from the EU’s 27 members.

“We assess the initiative positively,” Peskov told reporters on Thursday. “President Putin is a supporter of the restoration of the mechanism of dialogue and contacts between Brussels and Moscow.”

But Landsbergis told the FT on Wednesday that to restart meetings with Russia when Moscow “is the closest to the Soviet Union’s totalitarianism it has been for over three decades is irresponsible”.

The Lithuanian foreign minister added: “To fall into a trap once or twice may be regarded as a misfortune, but to continue doing so decade after decade looks like historical myopia.”

Given the EU’s divisions, Russia’s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov cautioned that it was unclear if the summit would ever happen. “We don’t even know whether the rest of the EU members agree with this,” he said.

Defenders of the German-French initiative pointed to tougher elements in their proposed text for the EU meeting, which vowed to seek a “firm and co-ordinated response” to any further “malign, illegal and disruptive activity” by Russia. It also floated the possibility of economic sanctions as part of the EU’s armoury when dealing with Russia. 

But after a late-night Wednesday meeting among ambassadors, the most difficult points were left for leaders to sort out — in particular a “review” of “the existing formats of dialogue with Russia, including at Leaders’ level”.

As he arrived for the summit, Rutte pointed to a possible way through the member states’ differences by suggesting he would be willing to see a summit between Putin and the presidents of the European Commission and European Council, but he would “not participate”.

The Brussels summit will also entail a debate on a lengthy list of areas earmarked by Germany and France for “selective engagement” with Russia. 

Recommended
Coming to terms with Putin's Russia
These include the environment, the Arctic, cross-border co-operation, energy, health, space, and the fight against terrorism and organised crime. Also on the list are foreign policy issues, including the Iran nuclear accord, Syria and Libya.

Merkel on Thursday said the EU must “define an agenda of common strategic interests” with Russia. But she sought to dispel the impression that she was trying to cosy up to Putin.

She said that individual EU member states were reacting in an “uncoordinated way” to “the multitude of Russian provocations” and needed to better harmonise their approach.

“We have to create mechanisms that would allow us to react in a united and collective manner to [such] provocations,” she added. “Only this way will we learn to confront Russia’s hybrid attacks.”

Merkel, who was giving her last speech to the Bundestag as chancellor ahead of federal elections in September, stressed that, because of its special “responsibility” to Ukraine, Belarus and the countries of the western Balkans, the EU “has to give an appropriate response to Russian activities” in those countries.",Salento,/r/europe/comments/o73xzb/eu_leaders_clash_over_germanfrench_push_for_putin/h2wd2bc/,JoeFalchetto,1624550870

The definition of rape varies based on each country's legislation. My guess in this case is that it would depend on the victim's testimony.

2226,"&gt; Its not just some articles, this idea is already existed in 1983, physicist like Bernard Cohen already talked about this idea. It doesnt have to replanish instantly, in fast breeder reactors it would still last a long time.

""It got talked about"", yes. Like I said, back of the envelope calculations and a list of assumptions.

&gt;Solar panels have their own problems, short lifespan, needing rare-earths to be produced, create toxic waste, by the way which we dont properly take care of...

Short lifespan is an advantage, not a disadvantage. It means less capital to lock up, faster returns on investment, faster technological updates, the advantages of mass productions,...

&gt;needing rare-earths to be produced, create toxic waste, by the way which we dont properly take care of...

The production of solar panels creating toxic waste is not different from other electronics production: it all depends on the legislation of the producing country. Renewables are a variety of electronics, and they aren't dependent on a single element like nuclear power is. Moreover, insofar they are limited by resource supply, then so is electricity consumption.

All these considerations are the same for nuclear, except their materials are rarer, are once-through due to the radiation and change in atoms through irradiation, so they can't even be recycled. 

&gt;same can be said about energy storage technology, we are ASSUMING we will be able to build enough energy storage to be able to combine with renewables to power humanity. Problem is that the technology we are focusing on: ""lithium"" based batteries has NO future and we are heavily investing in it, of course I know there are other types of energy storage like pumped water and compressed air and others but they have their own problems like being very dependent of location or very expensive. So we are focusing on lithium based batteries, the thing is that there is a lot less of it then even uranium, it all countries focus on making batteries from lithium it will last us only 50 years.

Lithium batteries are completely overengineered for grid purposes. They're okay for portable applications, but grid storage can be heavy and bulky that's not a problem. So there actually is quit some room for improvement, and we didn't look very hard yet because fossil fuels used to be our battery.

And we do have storage, it's just not competive with direct gas generation yet. If either carbon taxes get high enough or the storage methods become cheaper, it'll happen. Technology is not the problem, just economics, as usual.

This is, by the way, something that is not different for nuclear power. They also need storage of some kind.

&gt;You are still ignoring existance of uranium 238 which is over 100 times more common then uranium we are currently using to power nuclear power plants.

Because we can't, not without energy-intensive processing and that defeats the purpose since we're trying to get energy out of it. This would mean making nuclear energy even more expensive, and it isn't competitive today.

&gt;but it depends on access to right rare-earths and having energy storage technologies that can be rolled out as easily as solar panels are, but as I mentioned we arent there yet.

Again, a fully nuclear grid depends on storage too. France got to 78% thanks to oversubsidized plants from the past they can afford to run only half the time, but they will not do that again. Belgium never got higher than 66% nuclear electricity, relying on gas and coal to fill in the gaps.

2257,"&gt; Education doesn't happen exclusively in schools, education happens every day in one's family, village, city, group of friends, you name it. 

So what is the educational value of being brazen in public and shoving things, forcibly onto people who might see it as discomfortable. Is this education, like sitting down with people and explaining to them what is like to be gay, or it's just mocking people, taunting them?

&gt; Visibility of LGBT issues leads to discussion among friends/acquittances/family, people won't talk about it if they don't see it.

But if it's portrayed in an unsympathetic way then all those discussions in private will be hateful. Doesnt matter if you ban hatespeech publically, people will still talk about it negatively in private. You can't force people to your worldview, you have to invite them into it. There is a difference, and it's important.

&gt; Hell, when I was a kid I had no clue there was such a thing as homosexuality/gay even though I was jerking it to pictures of men in underwear found in my mother's Otto fashion catalogue. 

I am pretty sure the chuches told you about gay people, I grew up in an unreligious household, and I'm an atheist myself, and I knew what gays were as a  small kid. In fact when I was a teenager I used to watch transgender hentai, I`m not gay or anything, it was just for fun.

&gt; ""white moderate"" detailed by MLK, the one that prefers the violence and injustice of the status quo over some ruffled feathers.

I was expecting you to mention this. But then you admit that you view the world in black and white, as if there can't be people on the fence, neutral, uncaring about the issue, everyone must be either fully committed to LGBT or an absolute vicious hater. Then I have bad news for you, for about the majority of people I'm pretty sure they don't care. The only reason why even people bothered to vote that 66% in Romania is because the church told them too, which is more a lack of separation of church and state, which we don't have at all. The Orthodox Church and their political lackeys are totally violating the constitution, but who cares about that right? I`d say we should first go for secularism, and then talk about what's further.  But there different tactics are needed, because if you confront religious people about this, they might as well become more narrowminded and run back to their priests and become more fundamentalist with it. 

&gt; And were you to live in the same time period as protests for women's rights were happening, I have little to no doubt in my mind that you'd be there asking them speak more lady-like, to dress more lady-like, to behave more lady-like because they offend the sensibilities of the patriarchal figures. 

Well the first feminists were actually quite well mannered, so nothing like what is happening today happened in that period. Even the black civil rights movement was pretty well presented in the 60's, which can't be said about the current BLM which is again hurting the image of the black movement.

&gt; Why is that? V I S I B I L I T Y. From comedians, TV hosts, models, entrepreneurs, writers, actors, politicians to shows, events, parades and much earlier controversial events, some controversies happening to this day on the account of their cvasi-dictator Duterte.

Remains to be seen if this tactic works in the long term, because there might be backlashes, a reaction to this kind of ""too quick progress"". If people haven't digested it fully, it might create horrible backlashes. Sure developed countries where it has been introduced proportionally and the population is also better educated, there is little risk of backlash, but in the 3rd world IDK, you have seen what happened in the middle east with ISIS, that might be how lesser educated people respond to this. That is why, and especially in lesser developed zones, this should be promoted more carefully, because if you destroy the social norms that people got used to there, there might be a pretty bad reaction wave to it.",Romania,/r/europe/comments/o6jz4v/europe_poll_of_people_who_oppose_allowing_gays/h2vjrpf/,linux_user__,1624536174

2356,"Sea Breeze has been running annually since 1997 and is not just a NATO-only readiness exercise: it is a Partnership for Peace exercise and Russia was the first country to join PFP in 1994. Russia has opposed Sea Breeze from the beginning:

""Ships from five countries, including the United States, arrived at Ukraine's Crimean peninsula on 25 August 1997 to take part in naval exercises opposed by Moscow. The exercise in Ukraine was the first PFP exercise to be held on the former Soviets' base ever. In other words, the first in an area that was once part of the Soviet Union.  
  
The ships from Bulgaria, Georgia, Romania, Turkey and the United States arrived at Donuzlav naval base in western Crimea. Russia, whose Black Sea fleet is based nearby in the port of Sevastopol, rejected an invitation from Ukraine's Defense Ministry to take part in the Sea Breeze 97 exercises, but agreed to send observers. The exercise simulated a humanitarian mission, not the originally-planned combat operation. But the manoeuvres annoyed regional power Russia, which bases its Black Sea fleet nearby. The Russians boycotted Sea Breeze 97 because they considered the original scenario -- NATO forces assisting Ukraine to counter armed separatists -- to be provocative.""

Sometimes police or racist white people would attack them, but the activists never fought back.

North Macedonia asked to join the EU, Bulgaria expressed that we'd be really happy to have them, but first they have to stop state sponsored anti-Bulgarian propaganda, which includes, but isn't limited to:

1. Appropriating Bulgarian history and historical figures, denying their inherent Bulgarian origins and claiming them as North Macedonian (for example Tsar Samuel of Bulgaria, Gotse Delchev, Yane Sandanski, the Miladinov brothers and many, many more);

2. Calling Bulgarians Tatars, Mongols, Gypsies in their school textbooks, which is factually incorrect;

3. Spreading hatespeech towards Bulgarians in North Macedonian national media;

4. Cracking down on any local people inside North Macedonia, who identify as Bulgarians, which includes seizing books in Bulgarian language, imported from Bulgaria, closing down a radio station that broadcasted in Bulgarian, surveillance by the Police, beatings, arrests and more;

5. North Macedonians burning Bulgarian flags;

6. North Macedonians threatening people inside North Macedonia who identify as Bulgarians with violence and death without any reprecussions from law enforcement;

7. Destroying Bulgarian military graves, monuments, etc. Bulgaria fought many wars inside North Macedonia, with thousands of locals having served in the Bulgarian army;

8. Etc. for anything that I forgot to mention.

Bulgaria, on the other hand, has always helped North Macedonia, ever since its independence from Yugoslavia in 1991.

1. Bulgaria was the first country in the entire world to recognize the independence of North Macedonia. Furthermore, Bulgaria asked Russia and Turkey to recognize North Macedonia as independent, which they did.

2. Bulgaria allowed North Macedonia to use the port of Burgas for free during the Greek embargo.

3. Bulgaria donated (not sold) military tech to the North Macedonian army.

4. Bulgaria has helped with dealing with natural disasters like wild fires and floods.

5. Bulgaria is donating 50 000 COVID-19 vaccines to North Macedonia.

you yourself brought up the topic of the nuclear missiles...and germany could theoretically easily be attacked by a Russian fleet from the Baltic Sea...

Propaganda goes in both directions. Currently we in germany get more propaganda against Russia than the other way around. It was not always like this though. In the long run I think as China was recently announced by Biden as enemy Nr.1, I predict it is going to normalize.

As long as Russian minorities in the Baltic states are not oppressed and cheated for elections there is no point for them to try to secede from these countries. Russia convincing them to secede would be fruitless. And you already named NATO as another reason why Russia would never try anything there.

But honestly, I mean have you for one moment tried to see the situation in Ukraine from the perspective of the Russian speaking population ? A country diveded between the east and the west...A democratically elected government gets forced to step down because of a revolution which is only supported by the other half of the country. It is absulutely plausible that this ends either in civil war or secession attempts if they think they cannot gain back the political power which they won democratically.

Russia is country no. 15 on our export partners...no. 12 on imports  (data from 2018) long before many other european countries. And what is your point? because we trade more with Poland, Russia should be unimportant for us ? We also trade much more with small Netherland than with Poland. The size of a country has nothing to do with trade volume. How well our trade partners economy performs has also nothing to do with it...we can sell our products there or import goods. And natural resources is a very important asset. Having good trade realtions with a country having one of the biggest global gas reserves is a massive win for germany.

2544,"The French invasion of Russia, known in Russia as the Patriotic War of 1812 and in France as the Russian campaign, was begun by Napoleon to force Russia back into the Continental blockade of the United Kingdom

For the campaign of 1812 Napoleon summoned the largest army that Europe had ever seen. He also made unprecedented efforts to assemble supplies and transport, but these preparations were quite insufficient for an advance with such disproportionate forces far into Russia. He wrongly supposed that the campaign would be ended within 30 days.

The total invading force then numbered approximately 450,000; about 610,000 were to enter Russia during the campaign, and little more than 200,000 of them were French. The non-French contingents were destined for employment in secondary tasks, as the spearhead of the invasion force was composed of French troops.

The main French army began to cross the Neman into Russia on June 24, 1812. The first wave of the Grande Armée had around 400,000–450,000 soldiers, while the opposing Russian field forces amounted around 180,000–200,000 at this time.

2628,"John Cabot (Giovanni Caboto; c. 1450 – c. 1500) was an Italian navigator and explorer. His 1497 voyage to the coast of North America under the commission of Henry VII of England is the earliest-known European exploration of coastal North America since the Norse visits to Vinland around 1000 CE. 

 In May 1497 John Cabot set sail from Bristol in the small ship Matthew, with a crew of 18 men. He proceeded around Ireland and then north and west, making landfall on the morning of June 24. The exact landing place has never been definitely established: it has been variously believed to be in southern Labrador, Newfoundland, or Cape Breton Island. 

On going ashore, he noticed signs indicating that the area was inhabited but saw no people. Taking possession of the land for the English king, he unfurled both the English and Venetian flags. He conducted explorations from the ship along the coastline, naming various features Cape Discovery, Island of St. John, St. George’s Cape, the Trinity Islands, and England’s Cape. These may be, respectively, the present Cape North, St. Paul Island, Cape Ray, St. Pierre and Miquelon, and Cape Race, all in the area of Cabot Strait.

In the mistaken belief that he had reached the northeast coast of Asia, Cabot returned to Bristol on August 6, 1497. He reported that the land was excellent, the climate temperate, and the sea covered with enough fish to end England’s dependence on Iceland’s fish. 

In the midst of an enthusiastic welcome, he announced his plans to return to his landing place and from there sail westward until he came to Japan, the reputed source of spices and gems. On February 3, 1498, he received new letters patent for a second expedition. 

Cabot’s second expedition probably consisted of five ships and about 200 men. Soon after setting out in 1498, one ship was damaged and sought anchorage in Ireland, suggesting that the fleet had been hit by a severe storm. By 1499 Cabot had been given up for dead.

The effect of Cabot’s efforts was to demonstrate the viability of a short route across the North Atlantic. This would later prove important in the establishment of British colonies in North America.",Romania,/r/europe/comments/o6t9i3/24_june_1497_the_italian_explorer_and_navigator/h2umg9n/,filosoful,1624508167

Just this weekend someone posted an article about the BBC flat out telling white people to not apply for a job. I have seen a British video game company also say that they won't hire white people. There is a very clear anti-white bias going on in the UK. There is no such thing as white privilege. But yes, society is racist, against whites!

&gt;In fact, Gypsy and Roma children consistently achieve much lower outcomes than any other group; in the latest figures white FSM children are four times more likely to achieve good passes in English and maths GCSEs than children from Gypsy/Roma backgrounds.

Because Gypsy/Roma people are special and live in their own seperate society. Using them as a comparison to make the numbers look bigger is super dishonest.

So, these people should just pretend they don't exist in order to make homophobics feel more at ease and, therefore, become less homophobic. I guess the same reasoning would apply to racist and sexist people - they become more racist and sexist due to being confronted by their targeted groups fighting for their rights.

There was a recent law proposal, about restricting all broadcasts that try to  
sexualize children, or prompt sexual behavior in minors. It is also   
forbidden to distribute pornographic, and sexually explicit material to   
minors.

This was however, horribly worded in the official law proposal...That  
 awful wording sparked some pretty big international attention in the   
EU, since as we know, media coverage of laws is not very extensive and   
detailed. 

Now half the EU thinks Hungary wants to ban anything   
homosexual and that the government thinks homosexuals are all   
pedophiles, which is just a huge misinterpretation of what's written   
there + the AWFUL wording of this new law.

Seriously, it's so bad, it looks like no one was around to make sure this is okay  and won't cause a massive outrage...which it did.

So now, Germans are spamming pride flags and rainbows on the prime   
minister's home page (including on a post about a funeral, which is just  
 distasteful), and half of Europe is putting rainbows and pride flags   
everywhere to ""own the Hungarianz yo""

like about the greed ?  it didnt come from nothing it come from the fact  
 that Jewish people had higher position in the society then average   
polish person

Yes I have thought about it and it's just how racism and other biases operate. The outgroup will be dehumanized, associated with negative traits and the best part is that it doesn't need to have a slightest basis in reality.

So no, Jews in Poland did not have a better status financially - never mind any other kind of status.[Tomaszewski - Zydzi w II RP](http://ihuw.pl/sites/ihuw.pl/files/pictures/logo/Klasycy/j._tomaszewski_-_zydzi_w_ii_rp.pdf) from page 263 onwards. TLDR is following - Jew working class was concentrated in industries that paid worse, traders were not making much profit on their sales and the lawyers and doctors (few of them that they were) - in general worked as free agents - meaning less stability and worse pay in general.

So no, Jews in Poland did not have a better status financially - nevermind any other kind of status.

&gt;Why Jewish people were seen as enemy by some ?

Because racism and bigotry pretty much.

&gt;Another reason was that some Jewish movements, in particular the   
Yiddishist-oriented Jews, were against the undoing of the partitions of   
Poland, as such an event would spell the end of a united Russian Jewry

:) Please... Russian partition Jews were the worst off among all the partitions. You can refer Tomaszewski for that as well.

&gt;Tensions between Poles and Jews may also be attributed to the high   
amount of Communist party members within the Jewish community. But should not be attributed to an inherent “Polish xenophobia”.

First of all - given the poor status of Jewish workers higher participation rate in socialist and communist movements was to be expected. But nonetheless, they were a minority in those movements as well so singling it out as a cause for racial tensions is pretty much having it backwards. And singling out specific subsections of Communist party that had higher Jew percentage as an argument seems disingenuous at best, especially when not accompanied by the overall rate - which was around 20% for the Communist Party as a whole. 

And it's especially vile to mention such figures without mentioning the participation of Jews in Polish army, 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;In 1939, as Soviet troops were pouring into eastern Poland from the   
east, the Soviets employed the help of local Ukrainian, Belarusian and   
Jewish minorities in arresting, denouncing and executing Poles. While   
the majority of Jews were politically passive, Jews filled a prominent   
role in communist militias and manhunts, and many were remembered as   
spirited Soviet agents.

They were also employing help of Polish people in that very same task. 

&gt;Next time before you respond to me PLEASE read link I posted, it has a LOT of info.

I have skimmed through it before replying. Thing is - it is not a decent source but something put together in a pretty biased way, presenting parts of facts and statistics to masquerade as something factual. There is not much value in reading such things with attention once you realize this.

&gt;Yes I do know about this anti-semitic things, but did you ask yourself how things escalated to this level ?

Yup, it's racism and bigotry. And there is no reason to victim blame. The story of antisemitism in Poland is not that different from how the right wing organizations use all kinds of bigotry as a means to gain popular support preying on the cognitive biases of their targets.

The perception of Jews being better off/being against the country/pick other stuff was not about it being the factual reality but about rationalizing the negative emotions felt. 

But the story in which Jews are responsible for their plight feels so much better though - after all then it wasn't us that did that shit. And even if it was then it was for a good reason.

I don't know what would have to happen for them to lose elections.

Second option is that the programs won't work and will be waste of money (500+ was supposed to fix our demographics - they didn't as everyone predicated, and the program is just a money sink with the same stable negative demographics). There were loads of such programs, but majority of the voters, especially the older population that doesn't have access to internet or isn't super oriented how to use them, just watches TVP and their bullshit, where they just show the good stuff, and ignore the problems.

3193,"&gt; **Embarrassment as move announced on referendum anniversary – after trade deal created risk of fees**

&gt; One of the UK’s biggest mobile phone networks has announced roaming charges for Britons travelling to the EU, in a blow to Boris Johnson’s Brexit celebrations.

&gt; Customers of O2 have been told they will be billed £3.50 for every gigabyte (GB) of data used above a new limit of 25GB, from August.

&gt; The move comes after the Christmas Eve trade agreement signed by the UK left open the option of the return of roaming charges – which were scrapped across the EU in 2017.

&gt; In an embarrassment to the prime minister, it was announced on the fifth anniversary of the Brexit ‘yes’ vote, as he hailed the result as a spur to improving people’s lives.

&gt; “The decision to leave the EU may now be part of our history, but our clear mission is to utilise the freedoms it brings to shape a better future for our people,” Mr Johnson told MPs.

&gt; At Christmas, all the biggest UK operators said they had no plans to reintroduce roaming charges, but ministers admitted they had no plans to prevent them doing so.

&gt; The agreement merely encouraged operators to have “transparent and reasonable rates” – raising the risk of a return to the huge pre-2017 bills, sometimes running to hundreds of pounds.

&gt; In its email to customers, O2 announced “changes to our roaming fair usage policy”, from 2 August.

&gt; “As your monthly UK data allowance is over 25GB, you can still use your data in our Europe Zone,” one customer was told.

&gt; “But it’s now subject to a Roaming Limit of 25GB. Once you’ve reached this limit you’ll be charged an additional cost of £3.50/GB.”

&gt; The Independent has attempted to contact O2 about the switch, but nobody at the company answered the phone.

&gt; In December, O2 played down the return of roaming charges, saying: “We’re committed to providing our customers with great connectivity and value when they travel outside the UK.”

&gt; The government says it has passed legislation to protect holidaymakers, including a £45-a-month limit on any charges for using mobile data abroad before having to opt into further use

&gt; There are also requirements for customers to be informed when they have reached 80 per cent and 100 per cent of their data allowance.

&gt; And operators must take “reasonable steps” to avoid customers being charged for accidental roaming in Northern Ireland, which would happen if a phone locked onto the mobile signal coming from the Irish Republic.",English in Scotland,/r/europe/comments/o6ihd6/roaming_charges_to_return_for_travellers_to_eu_in/h2sm040/,Jaraxo,1624471780

**Brussels is ahead of Washington when it comes to dealing with Beijing.**

Bruno Maçães writes POLITICO’s Geopolitical Union column.

“Do we need a new adversary?” With those words, Armin Laschet summed up the European response to Joe Biden’s efforts to convince Europeans to get tougher on China.

As the politician best placed to become the next German chancellor, Laschet’s open rebuke of the U.S. president was the latest example in a series of polite disagreements between the two pillars of the transatlantic alliance over how to deal with the rising Asian superpower.

What’s usually overlooked, however, especially in Washington, is that the Europeans aren’t reluctant to get on board with Biden’s efforts because they don’t want to confront China. They’re cold on the idea because they have a plan of their own — and so far, it’s working.

The plan was first devised a little over two years ago, at a time when Trump’s America had turned its back on its European partners. As described by a senior official in Brussels, the decision to call China a “systemic rival” in March 2019 was everything that the EU’s foreign policy strives to be, almost always unsuccessfully.

The European Council had given the European Commission and the European External Action Service a mandate to come up with a new China strategy. And the two institutions took full advantage of it, drafting a bold document that never traveled to national capitals for assent.

I was living in Beijing at the time and can attest to how much the term riled and confused Chinese officials. And that initial salvo was not an isolated move. One month later, the EU issued Beijing with an ultimatum, calling on it to conclude negotiations on the China-Europe investment agreement, known as CAI, by the end of 2020.

Those negotiations had been dragging on for five years. Brussels wanted results.",,/r/europe/comments/o6fqqa/surprise_the_eu_knows_how_to_handle_china/h2s3tus/,quixotic_cynic,1624463964

To this day, the logic behind these moves remains poorly understood. As one person closely involved in the 2019 deliberations explained this week, the words “systemic rival” were meant to denote something very different from the formulation used in Washington: “strategic rival.”

With the notion of systemic rivalry, the European Union hoped to separate political differences and economic links. In strategic rivalry, conflict leads. In systemic rivalry, conflict is limited to the political sphere. It is part of the EU’s political tradition to believe that politics and the economy can be insulated from each other. Even inside the bloc, political differences with Poland and Hungary are not allowed to interfere with the single market.

Performing the same trick with China is far more difficult, but the Commission has been busy putting the plan in practice. Over the past two years, it approved a barrage of new regulations limiting the Chinese state’s ability to interfere with the framework of economic links between the two blocs. These include investment screening, trade defense instruments, a package against state subsidies and a public procurement tool.

t the same time, Brussels — with a push from German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who renewed the ultimatum in June 2020 — moved forward with negotiations on the CAI, finally agreed on by both sides in December. The senior official in the Commission, who requested to remain anonymous in order to speak freely, described China’s assent to the agreement as “a gift from Beijing.”

The deal included significant concessions from Beijing, including a greater level of market access and disciplines on state-owned enterprises, transparency of subsidies and rules prohibiting forced technology transfer. “By giving us a big gift, they hoped to prevent a united front with the Biden administration,” the official said.",,/r/europe/comments/o6fqqa/surprise_the_eu_knows_how_to_handle_china/h2s3vpe/,quixotic_cynic,1624463986

Beijing’s hope was not to be. What surprised China is that the EU never regarded the CAI as a political agreement. Having forced Beijing to concede on key points, the bloc did not hesitate to walk over China’s most salient red lines. On March 22, the EU joined the U.K. and the U.S. in imposing sanctions aimed at Chinese officials believed to be involved in human rights violations in Xinjiang province.

The move threw Beijing off balance — as evidenced by its reaction. Many in Brussels believed China would be too concerned with preserving the CAI to react or would do so within strict limits. Instead, the Chinese Foreign Ministry reacted with blind brutality.

Chinese embassies in Europe had been asked in advance to collect a list of undesirables, which included members of the European Parliament belonging to almost every political group. That list seems to have been approved by the top leadership in Zhongnanhai with little or no scrutiny, and little concern for the agreement’s fate.

That reaction reveals a lot about the relationship between the EU and China, and the fact that Beijing felt it had been outplayed. While a second official in the Commission told me that the top leadership in Beijing was poorly advised, none of the Chinese officials I talked to expressed any doubt that, on March 22, the Chinese leadership decided to kill the investment agreement with the European Union. The choice was conscious and deliberate.

Since taking over the brief in August 2020, Xi Jinping had fought hard to take the deal over the line. So why did he change his mind? The clue is in something the influential academic Cui Hongjian told me this week: “Strategic partners do not sanction each other.” The Chinese side had seen the CAI as a political agreement.

Like good Marxists, Chinese officials do not believe in the separation between politics and the economy. But Brussels’ decision to sanction four political officials showed that “systemic rivalry” was still valid and operational. According to an official in the Chinese State Council, Xi decided that the Europeans had betrayed the spirit of the agreement and that China should put its foot down.",,/r/europe/comments/o6fqqa/surprise_the_eu_knows_how_to_handle_china/h2s3yrd/,quixotic_cynic,1624464024

Liu Zuokui of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences expanded on the feeling of frustration in a conversation this week: “In other words, on the one hand, the two sides should overcome their differences and negotiate. On the other hand, the EU can punish China at any time according to its own needs, and it is estimated that China may acquiesce to such punishment.”

What this means is that Brussels — not Washington or Beijing — has a clear vision of what the terms of the relationship between the West and China should be: economic integration but on a European not a Chinese model.

Chinese officials may complain about the term “systemic rivalry,” but they believe in it as much as Brussels. The difference is that for Beijing, there is no separation between market and state. Interestingly, this is also the view in Washington — but Europeans are convinced they have a better plan.

They will keep insisting that to do business in their territory, China will have to do it on European terms. And indeed, Chinese officials have sent some messages that they want to continue talking. “We are very calm,” said the official in Brussels.",,/r/europe/comments/o6fqqa/surprise_the_eu_knows_how_to_handle_china/h2s405a/,quixotic_cynic,1624464040

3425,"Agreed, the issue is definitely not only in France. I was just exposing my 2 cents from my experience there.

The ""Xenophobia"" of the French people however is staggering. I am half Dutch, very pale and very blond and growing up in the south of France with mostly tanned and dark haired kids , I was often insulted for being a filthy immigrant/foreigner. Even though I was born there...

Part of the issue there is this huge national pride which the French have. Not discounting all the great contributions France has done for the world as we know it, but the people who are being awful haven't done that and should really keep themselves in check.

The issue with the Nazis on the other hand I have to disagree with you. Nazis are people who took part in this political ""ideal"" and saw a way to profit off of being and acting terrible towards others. There were Austrians, Dutch, Danish, French, Italian and others who were Nazis. This generalization of Germans were Nazis is wrong in my opinion. There definitely were a lot of Germans who were against Nazis. Undoubtedly there have been some Polish people who have joined the ranks of the Nazis (be it by force or voluntarily). But I suspect that these people, once the war was over got persecuted by their neighbors and relatives when they came back home. (I had a case like this in my Dutch family apparently, dude got hanged in the village because he delivered 2 neighboring Jewish families to the Nazis when everyone else was trying to protect them...)

Part of the issue with the portrayal of such events is ""Nuance"" a very important part of each and every aspect of human history and interaction. Generalization of events and people is bad regardless of what direction you go in. This oversimplification of events is exactly what creates more radicalization in all parts of the world. Currently in Europe, Muslims get persecuted because of inaccurate portrayal of this people and their way of life. (no I'm not religious). Countering arguments by another party, citing sources and being open to the idea of being wrong is something I feel is not present enough in society and ultimately I fear for what bullshit comes next.",,/r/europe/comments/o6afba/france_polish_student_got_a_correction_in_the/h2rbqpe/,MonsieurRedBeard,1624449620

Sanctioning Crimea just shows that they believe those people are okay with Russia.

3484,"&gt;It's way too common to be just mistakes and coincidences. Notice how often western media try to portray Poles as perpetrators during WW2

Which fucking news sources portray Poland as starting or helping to start the war? Saying there were Polish citizens that collaborated with the Nazi's/Germans isn't false. In the case of Treblinka it is but there were Poles that helped the Nazi's just like others in other occupied countries helped the Nazi's.

&gt;and at the same time you very often can't find the word ""German"" anywhere when Nazis and their crimes are being discussed.

People mix German and Nazi all the time because they were the same thing.

&gt;In few generations of this brainwashing people will think obviously those Nazis had to be Polish since there were ""Polish death camps staffed by Poles"" and who knows what else they teach where there is no one to protest like Jakub did.

It represents 33% of the new nuclear projects in Europe in the last few decades. Moreover, Flamanville gets pretty much the same results. So it's not an outlier.

&gt;What? This makes no sense. Oh, i was suppose to just drop the subject once you explained it by bring Olkiluoto in the picture... How does your mind work?

Where did I say you were supposed to drop the subject? The argument was made higher in the thread that constructing nuclear plants would cause a 15 year more of status quo. You asked where the number came from and I answered. So you can retract your doubt about the number, and instead perhaps explain how you are going to mitigate the 15 year continuation of the status quo of emissions while nuclear plants get built in your plan. Do keep in mind that a second wave of construction, is again going to take 15 years so that puts us in 2050 already - assuming no additional delays.

&gt;	The initial aim of the European Union (EU) was to make the European Space Agency (ESA) an agency of the EU by 2014.[4] While the EU and its member states fund together 86% of the budget of ESA, it is not an EU agency. Furthermore, ESA has several non-EU members notably the United Kingdom which had left the EU while remaining a full member of ESA. ESA is partnered with the EU on its two current flagship space programs, the Copernicus series of Earth observation satellites and the Galileo satellite navigation system, with ESA providing technical oversight and, in the case of Copernicus, some of the funding. [5] The EU, though, has shown an interest in expanding into new areas, whence the proposal to rename and expand its satellite navigation agency (the European GNSS Agency) into the EU Agency for the Space Programme. The proposal drew strong criticism from ESA, as it's perceived as encroaching on ESA's turf.[5]

&gt;	In January 2021, after years of acrimonious relations, EU and ESA officials mended their relationship, with the EU Internal Market commissioner Thierry Breton saying ""The European space policy will continue to rely on ESA and its unique technical, engineering and science expertise,” and that “ESA will continue to be the European agency for space matters.",This is not a flag,/r/europe/comments/o60i36/esa_european_space_agency_for_2021/h2r2xhh/,Itja,1624442410

Just yesterday the Japanese government has suggested a 4 day work week, and in connection with their workers working less during their time in office/job sites, it's no wonder the economy stopped growing and that Japan found itself in the problems it did. As much as egalitarian societies like to deny this, different people produce and work differently.

3582,"It's less bad in the UK than in some central-European countries but the problem is that the west is getting chronically overaged which longterm is a danger to democracy.

Generally a very young populace makes things such as violent civil wars (seen in many places in Africa over tha last 60 years) more likely, whereas many old people will lead to downfall by stagnation. A very old electorate isn't very interested in future-proofing as is out of touch with the times. Different age groups have different strengths and a good mixture seems adviseable. As is, we simply need more kids (almost everywhere in Europe).

When todays old generation was young, they were the majority and it was like that for basically every prior generation, the young were always the majority. The current state is completely unprecedented and it's actually a massive scale democratic experiment we are experiencing. 

And this is just the democratic challenge. The rising median age also challenges our labour-based collective social safety nets and even our housing markets (as people don't live together with their parents longterm anymore) and many more things.

3586,"Read the 4th paragraph if u read nothing else:


Both the USSR and the Third Reich saw themselves as diametrically opposed to each other on the global stage. One of the neater visualizations of this rivalry was the 1937 Paris Exhibition, where the German and Soviet pavilions tried to one-up each other in size and pomposity- as seen in this [photo](https://i0.wp.com/www.culturedarm.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/ParisIntExpo1937.jpg). This exhibition was not a fluke. In propaganda and rhetoric, each dictatorial regime posed the other as their antithesis. 

For the Third Reich, the Soviets were the foremost example of a Judeo-Bolshevik attempt to undermine German culture and racial solidarity. *Mein Kampf* was clear on this, as was various state propaganda. For their part, Stalin's propaganda organs lumped Hitler in with other fascist movements as the last gasp of monopoly capital that now had to back strongmen like Hitler and Mussolini to prevent a proletarian revolution. 

This mutual antipathy went beyond public invective and into actual policies. The advent of the Hitler government led to the closure of secret German-Soviet military training centers by the end of 1933. This joint training was fraught at the best of times during Weimar as neither side fully trusted the other, but a National Socialist government was too unpalatable for the centers' Soviet hosts. Although the USSR did welcome in KPD and other German refugees, any connection to Germany became ideologically suspect for the NKVD and such connections could become a pretext for removal during the Purges. For its part, the Third Reich became host to a number of White emigres and other anti-communists. Hitler's seizure of power also led to major rearrangements on the European diplomatic front. The Soviets began to send out feelers to various Western and Eastern European states for a common bloc to stand against the rogue adventurism of fascism. In the meantime, Hitler began to try and forge a bloc of his own centered on anti-communism. Both of these diplomatic initiatives failed. Many countries in the West and Eastern Europe rightly suspected Stalin's motives and the costs of a Soviet alliance. While the Soviet initiatives bore some fruit in ending the diplomatic isolation of the USSR, it was never fully able to transition to a functional alliance or partnership system. But the meager results of Soviet diplomacy paled before the abject failures of Hitler's overtures for alliances. In short, Hitler did not so much demand alliance partners as he did vassals. Early initiatives to Poland fell flat as did other tepid overtures to would-be partners. The Anti-Comintern Pact of 1936 between Italy and Japan had no real mechanisms for collective action and all three signatories pursued their own foreign policy agendas irrespective of the needs of their partners in the struggle against Communism. Germany, for example, continued to be one of the main supplier of military hardware to Republican China even after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War because such trades provided the Reich much needed hard currency and raw materials Japan could not provide. Hitler's foreign policy successes were ones achieved because of other countries' inaction. Even the Munich Pact did not lead to a lasting alliance or partnership with the parties involved, but  further diplomatically isolated Hitler on the continent. 

The only period at which the two countries seemed to be working together was the brief period of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. This relationship was far from a functioning alliance and more a byproduct of immediate needs and diplomatic mistakes. Stalin's motives are somewhat unclear for making the move to Germany. One interpretation is that Stalin wanted to gain as much assistance from Germany as possible in light of a realistic assessment of Hitler's long-term intentions. The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact included provisions for German technical assistance and exchange while the USSR provided the German war economy much needed natural resources. Variations of this interpretation would play out in the post-Barbarossa justifications of the Pact with the added twist that since the West had shown it foolishly trusted Hitler more than the Soviets, Stalin needed to play for time. Another interpretation of Stalin's actions was that he viewed the outbreak of war in Marxist-Leninist terms. War between the Western allies and Germany was the harbinger of a final internal struggle of imperialist capitalism. The Soviet's backing of the weaker power ensured that this struggle would be protracted and pave the way for a Soviet-style revolution throughout Europe. This was the prediction Stalin gave to the Comintern chief Georgi Dimitrov, who recorded in his diary:

&gt; A war between two groups of capitalist countries (poor and rich as regards colonies, raw materials and so forth)- for the redistribution of the world, for the domination of the world! We see nothing wrong with their having a good fight and weakening each other. It would be as fine at the hands of Germany the richest capitalist countries (especially England) were shaken. Hitler, without understanding it or desiring it, is shaking and undermining the capitalist system.

Dimitrov would explain in various communiques to Communist Parties that while the 1930s Popular Front strategy of allying with Western democratic parties to combat fascism was correct, within the context of war, the ideologically correct view was to see both sides as imperialist aggressors. Communist activism was to highlight the bourgeois profiteering of the Western powers, both of whom controlled large global empires. Within this context, painting Germany as a relatively innocent victim underscored the true nature of the division of the global economy. 

Whatever Stalin's motivations, Hitler's was much easier to parse out for the Pact. The Pact not only secured the Polish prize, it also led to Soviet guarantees of natural resources that war would disrupt. In theory, the Pact would also discourage Western intervention on Poland's behalf as it showed them that there was no prospect of Soviet intervention on behalf of Poland. In this respect, the Pact failed, but the resources and secure flank allowed Germany to negate the impact of the British blockade and complete some of its rearmament in time for the campaigns of 1940 and 1941. 

The idea that ""Hitler thought the USSR would help him in his fight against democracy"" is representative of an outdated thesis that still enjoys some currency called the totalitarian paradigm. This thesis gained a great deal of currency during the Cold War and it held that both Fascism and Communism were two heads of the same oppressive coin. As such, both political ideologies saw themselves as the direct political opponents of liberal democracy, championed by the West and especially the US. Totalitarian interpretations really did not take into account the real differences between the two ideologies and, for this question, confused who the archenemy was for Nazi and Communist ideologues. While neither the Third Reich nor the Stalinist USSR's state ideologies had a high opinion of liberalism, they both perceived it as a weak and retreating ideology. The liberal democratic powers were thus not enemies in these opposed *Weltanschauung*s, but rather a potential weak partner. At the core of a lot of Soviet and German diplomatic initiatives of the 1930s was the idea that they were on the right side of history and that the liberal democracies were either afraid of this reality or could be reluctantly brought to heel.",Malta,/r/europe/comments/o5dtrv/on_this_day_in_1941_nazi_germany_began_a_massive/h2r38xj/,pureideology69,1624442706

First, the Spanish citizens voted a new parliament, in 1977. Those elections were already free, with participation from all the forces including the communist party. The resulting parliament proposed a new constitution which was drafted by a committe formed by several catalans, including members of the the communist party, socialists, and even a nationalist. This proposal was approved in 1978 by 87% of the people, 90% in Catalonia.

&gt; Was a totally democratic process? not in the slightest.

I'm not saying they should be exposed to porn, obviously not. But they should definitely be exposed to same-sex couples for example.

Allowing left-handedness in school and exposing children to that didn't convert more children to becoming left-handed. [This graph is often used](https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZEHSVKDBCIY2VLUEL2EVOKX2QI.png). As left-handedness was accepted and it was normal to come out as left-handed, the percentage stagnated at 12%.

So as LGBT becomes normalised, people will come out more, which at the moment does increase the percentage, but it will stagnate.

Teaching children about LGBT does not convert them to LGBT. If they were LGBT before they knew, they were LGBT already. Even if some children (those after puberty that is) do want to test things out, they are free to do so, and see if they are gay or bi, that's fine.

I have no clue as to your level of education, but if it's anything like what I know about north American education standards, it's far from enough. But again, maybe you do read interviews and pieces by historians who go through archives in order to find information on their topic of interest. I just don't know.

&gt;Kremlin Propaganda

Alright well first of all, if you start off with an attitude of ""everything I disagree with I'd propaganda"" you're not gonna get far in life.

&gt;EdUcAtE yOuRsElF

I gotta say, sending a Wikipedia article right after having been shown that Wikipedia can - and is - full of bullcrap isnt a great look. Although I'm not sure what part of this is supposed to deny the exchange of information (and resources, might I add again) between western powers and the nazis, as well as eastern powers and the nazis.

&gt;Division along that line thing

I was talking about genuine division, not pulling a US of A (that is, ""spheres of influence"")

&gt;Always the victim :(

I never said the soviets were always the victims, but considering the fact that they've been attacked by western powers after the revolution, after which they were completely economically ignored, and now they've got the US and Britain trying to push Hitler into attacking them (remember how I mentioned that the states were shipping hitler raw materials etc? You think that that policy of appeasement was because they were idiots? No, they knew exactly what they were doing.) - you gotta cut them a bit of slack.

I honestly don't know enough about the war crimes you speak of to answer that point.

&gt;Wrong again

You say I was incorrect about the effective dissolution of the polish government, but you don't really say anything against it. Think of it this way - if Germany's invading France, and they've got some base of supporters throughout the entirety of France, AND they're already more than halfway through and advancing further with little resistance and no sign of stopping, WITH the government running, you think anyone in the country will listen to them? Really?

&gt;Whitewashed history

And uh... I don't see how what I said is whitewashed history. It's a clear fact that the only soviet attending this ""dual"" parade was the commander, who, might I add, didn't agree to the parade, instead telling his troops to remain outside the city.

Initially yes, since they had better reason/necessity (i.e. being the target of genocide) to join. The ethnic makeup shifted over the years.

3986,"&gt;What metric are you using to compare the propaganda?

Basic knowledge that everyone with at least half a brain has.

&gt;You concentrated on Poland

Don't try to divert the subject by blaming me. You were the one who stuck to Poland and didn't address invading other countries.

&gt; which they apparently held hands and invaded together (they didn't, but that's not stopping you from saying it).

Of course they did, that's basic WW2 history and you are now denying facts.

&gt;I get that you want to have it both ways, but you simply cannot continue to deny that the Soviets were preparing for conflict with the Nazis if you want to talk about the invasion of Finland (which, again, negotiations were step 1).

That is irrelevant. They invaded Finland for territorial gain, just like Germany invaded Poland for territorial gain.

&gt;Romania, as outright evil when they were an Axis ally for the beginning of the war

Dude, they became an ally *after* the Soviet Union had occupied Bessarabia...

&gt;I thought you believed that being an ally of the Nazis made you as bad as, if not worse than, the Nazis? How is Romania the victim here?

A neutral country whose territory the USSR invaded, how the hell are they not a victim?

And still comfortably leaving aside Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. What did they ever do to deserve being invaded by the Soviets?

&gt;Now, are we interested in the evils of the Soviet Union, or of Stalin specifically?

They're the same, unless you mean the evils of the Soviet Union committed before and after his rule.

&gt;fighting the Nazis and destroying Ukrainian landowners that preserved their power structure through anti-semitic violence were awesome.

**Reported you for [genocide denial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holodomor)!**

&gt;Because it doesn't support your narrative.

No, because that doesn't excuse any Soviet crimes.

&gt;So making an agreement with the Nazis makes both sides evil?

Making an agreement with anyone with those intentions makes a country evil. It made both Germany and the USSR evil.

&gt;The US had trade agreements with the Nazis. France had a nonaggression pact with them.

Did those trade agreements have a secret protocol whereby the two countries agreed to invade countries together? Seriously, how can you be that obtuse?

&gt;The Nazis had ulterior motives. The Soviets had ulterior motives. I know you know that.

Of course I know that, yet you are the one defending the Soviets here...

&gt;Glad we resolved that issue.

*Based on the MRP* ffs... That means that both Germany and the USSR invaded Poland and that in general started the war. Nobody is denying that there was a two week gap in between, it's just that the gap is irrelevant if you take the prior secret agreement into account...

&gt;If they are all objectionable, list all of them.

I should list *all* Soviet crimes? Are you for real?

&gt;I'm bored of your vague rhetoric.

Because I don't enter with absolutist statements that aren't true.

&gt;""They were evil because they did crimes"" is so lazy and it wastes so much energy to finally pry more out of you than ""they invaded Poland.""

As we *already* discussed, they also invaded Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Romania. They destroyed the entire political, military, economic, cultural and intellectual elites of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania and deported several percentages of their population to Siberia and started heavily Russifying them. They also executed 22,000 Polish officers and intelligentsia at Katyn. Those are just a few of the most notable ones from that period, of course there were more and it is bad faith from you to tell me to ""list them all""...

&gt;What happened to this being irrelevant? 

What are you even talking about? Stop trying to excuse Soviet crimes! *No* Western action was even close to being a sufficient reasoning for the Soviets to become allies with Nazi Germany...

Meanwhile, Italians actively controlled their half with a full-on occupation of the terrain, with little regard for what Ustaše thought or wanted. They even enlisted Chetniks as their own auxiliary forces in Dalmatia and Krajina.

On top of that, Ustaše and the conscripted Domobran forces were also used by Germans and Italians as auxiliary forces in their war against the partisans. Ustaše and Domobrani went where they were sent and did what they were told by the German military command, not by the so-called Croatian government.

4074,"1. The nuclear attacks against japan were not the worst option. It is likely that if Japan was invaded, more civilians would have died than through the nuclear approach. Nuclear war is terrible, but war during that era was terrible. It was a fast, easy approach that was the only way to make japan surrender without millions more people dying. The Japanese showed that they were willing to fight till the last man, and that they weren’t afraid to commit crimes for their cause. The only way we could make them surrender with few losses was through the bombs. When they found we had this technology, they were unable to continue fighting. It was a nasty approach, but a necessary one, especially against such an enemy. All Nations in the war were already using bombs to destroy cities, as it was the only way to counter the enemy doing the same. Once again, ugly, but needed. I would not count this as an atrocity, however atrocious it was. 

America’s killing of natives on mass was not wholly by the government or their terrible laws against the natives, as disease killed most of the natives. A high estimate of 10 million natives lived in America before the Europeans arrived, and 90% were killed by disease. So too few natives survived in America in order for them to be killed at the same scale of the ussr’s killings. Plus many were killed by the British and Dutch who were here before America was created, lowering their number even more. The Spanish also helped to kill many of them when they took over Texas and Florida. So very few natives were left when America started to kill them. But then you must also look at the context of time: most genocides against natives happened well before the ussr was created. So this lowers America’s atrocity count more. But then during this time, the USA still mistreated natives, taking their land and making them suffer. This mistreatment is an atrocity, but no where near as atrocious as the crimes of Stalin and the USSR. The USA also didn’t fight to keep slaves, that was the confederacy. It was the USA that was progressive enough to eventually put a stop to slavery. Then we also have the same problem of time frame: slavery and the civil war ended long before the ussr existed. That would be like me saying that the ussr is responsible for the monarchy, which is contradictory and stupid, just like blaming the union ,that won ,for the stupidity of the CSA. Russia only abolished slavery because it didn’t rely on it economically the same way America did, while America abolished it because it was morally wrong, even though we suffered huge economic problems from the civil war. But , time frame keeps this from being relevant. I am not responsible for my great grandfather’s actions. 
The ussr might not have had segregation in the same way America did, but they sure did love taking human rights away. Since when was the ussr a protected of human rights? What was supposed to be a dictatorship of the proletariat became a hellhole for those that made it, unless they happened to be on top. Racism did exist in Russia, especially in this time, it’s just that we don’t see the same segregation and criminal violence caused by it because the ussr did not have the same ethnic diversity and immigration that the USA had. If the ussr has the same huge waves of immigration that America had, in sure they would have been just as racist and stupid. So yes, America was quite racist. Is this an atrocity? Yeah. Is it worse than what the ussr did? No! Are you seriously using radian as an excuse for the ussr’s actions! America didn’t genocide blacks because they didn’t like them, at least not on the governmental scale, like how the ussr treated Ukraine. The ussr murdered millions- this is not the same as holding many people in prison. Yeah, America has a huge prison population, but at least we don’t have prisons like the ussr did. I don’t think I need to explain why the ussr had a bad reputation in the prison system. The ussr also has lots of military bases. I mean, they were just as imperialist as America in this time: the two countries were rivals for a reason, they often got in each other’s way. Both countries had puppet states and foreign armies. Military bases are not an atrocity, and military bases are also not nearly 20 million dead people. 


Want me to explain what the ussr did wrong? Were do I begin. 

Many people in Estonia were forced to work for the red army, it was basically slavery. 12,000 people died. But I guess that’s fine with you, right, since they were just filthy capitalists anyway.

Oh yeah, did I also mention that Estonia lost around 20% of its population during soviet occupation. That’s 1 in 5 people. Imagine one in every five people you know dying. Pretty terrible. The soviet occupation under Stalin led to five times more deaths than nazi Germany’s occupation of that same region. If this wasn’t a repeated incident, I bet people would focus on it more. 

But it sure would be repeated by the USSR. 

Latvia was taken over by the ussr, and many people were arrested, deported, and killed. It was quite tame compared to what the red army showed they could do in other places. 

Lithuania lost nearly 800,000 citizens during soviet occupation. Many left or were deported or killed. 

You inferred in your reply that America had a corrupt prison system. This is true, but at least we don’t literally murder prisoners on mass. People would be taken from their homes and put in prison, only to be killed by the ussr. They viewed all enemies as lesser beings who needed to be killed for opposing their views. It was toxic, evil, and terrifying. There was no trial, no hope, no rehabilitation for opposition to Bolshevik rule, only pain and death. 

The soviets were, in fact, racist. A Pole is different from a Russian, and so to a Lithuanian. The reds didn’t like this. They suppressed these ethnic groups and treated them like animals, similar to antebellum southern America, but in a modern age when such actions should of been inexcusable even to the most cruel of men. 
Their prisons were no more than death camps, where men would be tortured and killed for the state’s will. It was evil, at a scale only recently seen. 

One word: poland. Poland, that great country between Germany and Russia, was raped by the two. Like beasts the two nations tore through the flesh of a civilized society, licking clean the bones of a once prosperous nation, ripping its citizens and culture away. Poland today is a shell of its former self, and this is not its own fault. The fault for Poland’s modern crisis and state is the ussr. They invaded the country, deporting over a million citizens into Russia, killing all who resisted. Brave men who fought and died to preserve Poland were taken and killed by the Russian red army. This is not comparable to any atrocity America has done, and boy has America done a lot. This invasion was a human rights violation, and the mistreatment of the poles was very much about ethnic cleansing as it was about power-hungry invasion. The same Poles who fought against the nazi regime ended up fighting the reds, because they saw the same thing any logical human would: the red army, Stalin, and the USSR, were evil. When the USA liberated France, they were met with cheers. When the soviets “liberated” Poland and Germany, they raped and plundered until there was nothing left to be taken. The ussr raped Poland, there is no denial of this. 


40% was the death rate of finish POW inside soviet prisons. This is not the largest number. 

In the years of Stalin, “resettling” people was a popular action. Millions were forcefully taken from their homes and taken to labor camps to be forced to work. Hundreds of thousands died or were killed along the way, including innocent families.

Every new culture the reds encountered was suppressed just like the conservatives in Russia had been during the beginning of the revolution. Anyone who sought a political career outside of the Bolshevik party was usually inprisoned or murdered. 

Is the Nemmersdorf massacre also to be forgotten? 

Civilians have died, tens of millions of them, for what? 
These crimes that the USSR commuted are worse than anything America, France, and even Britain did in the same time frame.

Just a few days ago, the Vatican has activated its diplomatic channels and requested the Italian government to modify the proposal of the Zan law, simply put: a law which strengthens protection towards the LGBT.  The Vatican kept quiet, until the thematic came up of openly talking about sexuality related issues at educational institutions. You can take whatever side you please, but ultimately Catholicism as whole religion is not open to homosexuality, and will only do so much as tolerate, but not engage further into the community if it makes sense. 

As in Pope Francis also represented this same idea of acceptance, but ultimately his power of changing the mindset within the church is also limited (not sure if he spoke up about actually looking into modifying testaments). The proposal made by the Vatican of retreating the Zan law, is now being examined by the Senate Justice Commission, as it would violate ""some contents of the Concordat revision agreement"".

You can't destabilize a region, unless you're generating artifical earthquakes, my friend. You can destabilize enemy regimes, just as they attempt to do to you.

&gt;Ask Mossad how many organizations declared and recognized as terrorists are on their payroll. 

Nowhere near tens of millions of Shia extermists and anyone on Mossad's payroll is definitely not doing so openly, unlike Iranian proxies who sincerely endorse their ideology as opposed to being blackmailed or paid.

4139,"What metric are you using to compare the propaganda?

&gt; You concentrated on Poland

*You* concentrated on Poland, which they apparently held hands and invaded together (they didn't, but that's not stopping you from saying it). I get that you want to have it both ways, but you simply cannot continue to deny that the Soviets were preparing for conflict with the Nazis if you want to talk about the invasion of Finland (which, again, negotiations were step 1). I don't even know how you want to frame occupation of, for example, Romania, as outright evil when they were an Axis ally for the beginning of the war and then shifted sides; I thought you believed that being an ally of the Nazis made you as bad as, if not worse than, the Nazis? How is Romania the victim here?

Now, are we interested in the evils of the Soviet Union, or of Stalin specifically? I'll gladly concede one of these, but it isn't the one you've been beating me over the head with all day. Stalin was a mixed bag, on the one hand criminalizing homosexuality and deporting minorities was an obvious low, fighting the Nazis and destroying Ukrainian landowners that preserved their power structure through anti-semitic violence were awesome.

&gt; Because that was irrelevant.

Because it doesn't support your narrative.

&gt; Nobody cares whether either side honoured that agreement or not

So making an agreement with the Nazis makes both sides evil? The US had trade agreements with the Nazis. France had a nonaggression pact with them. The Nazis had ulterior motives. The Soviets had ulterior motives. I know you know that.

&gt; World War II is generally considered to have begun on 1 September 1939, when Nazi Germany, under Adolf Hitler, invaded Poland. 

Glad we resolved that issue.

&gt; But not saying all of them means that I take up the position that some of their crimes weren't objectionable...

If they are all objectionable, list all of them. I'm bored of your vague rhetoric. ""They were evil because they did crimes"" is so lazy and it wastes so much energy to finally pry more out of you than ""they invaded Poland.""

&gt; Anyone with at least half a brain would have done the same. The USSR was a repressive hostile imperialistic dictatorship and it was not to be trusted.

What happened to this being irrelevant? 

&gt; Propagandists often try to do that, but it's impossible in a facts-based environment.

4149,"&gt;I would not use Olkiluoto as a proper example of anything but a scam in a huge scale, sanctioned by French government..

So it doesn't count if it doesn't paint nuclear in a favorable picture? That's really the current state of nuclear technology. Olkiluoto, Flamanville, Hinkley Point - those are the most recent projects in Europe and they're all dealing with cost and schedule overruns. Even if the next three projects are perfect, that's still just 50/50.

&gt;And doesn't that mean we have to do both, build new nuclear AND other solutions?

That's one problem: nuclear power makes other investments harder because they suck up investment money, and basically squat on their piece of the market for half a century, getting more outdated every day.

&gt;I really sense that there is something else behind your reasoning than just practical matters, like an ideology that has managed to close nuclear plants for no good reason but scaremongering.

4182,"I... Disagree on the time of day being unimportant. Working hours still are (and for the foreseeable future will almost certainly continue to be defined by) the sun because we're daylight creatures, which isn't really changing. As long as we're on Earth, we will begin our days around when the sun comes up and end it around when the sun goes down, and timezones make calculations around that easier.

The moment we go to space however, things change. That said, UTC makes even less sense in space. The concepts of a year, day, hour and minute are all based on either the orbit of the earth around the sun, or the rotation of the earth on its occurs. UTC, as used by standard clocks, is basically a time zone, and one that includes leap seconds, probably one of the most earth-centric things we do to time.

I get what you're getting at, timezones are annoying, but the alternative in the world we live in with no timezones fixes none of the problems, it just shifts the numbers and makes things more cumbersome for the people living there. If we want to worry about space exploration, we don't need to all use UTC. UTC and things like the Unix Timestamp exist. It's already how computers keep track of time, so the day we colonize space, we already have coordinated time. There's just no good reason to force everyone on the planet to stick to that same clock if they'll just be living in offsets from people the best country over anyways.

You can already see the issue doing massive unified timezones has in places with comically wide timezones like China. The west side of the country officially uses Beijing Time, but you basically have half of regions like Xinjiang running on a local, more appropriate timezone, and the other half running on Beijing time, which just makes things even worse.",,/r/europe/comments/o5qtfg/central_europe_according_to_clocks/h2pajne/,rickyman20,1624400115

&gt;But on Wednesday, Hugo Boss appeared to reverse its position, telling its Chinese customers that it uses Xinjiang cotton in its clothing products and doesn't plan to stop.

&gt;“For many years, we have respected the One China principle, resolutely defending national sovereign and territorial integrity,” Hugo Boss said in a statement on Chinese social media. “Xinjiang’s long-stapled cotton is one of the best in the world… We will continue to purchase and support Xinjiang cotton.”

Feel free to source them denouncing their past, because I'm pretty sure it doesn't exist. Their ""zero"" tolerance policy is selectively applied at best.

I disagree completely. Sympathy I can have but the emotional process of empathy is something else; it involves identifying with what someone is feeling and, additionally, actually feeling those feelings yourself. 

It’s literally impossible to do that for everything or as you say ..”a given thing” , you are feeling with every situation. You’d be far better off caring about your friends on WhatsApp and making sure your local homeless shelter etc has funding , not feeling with a load of rich millionaires farmers who absolutely hate the EU and probably all of us in it.

Learn the meaning of rhetoric

&gt; Most of them are undeniably democratic states. Are you blaming all of them of being Nazis now?

Dunno how you made that leap but have fun with it. Doesn't do a single thing to refute anything I said

&gt; Explain. Also, definitely not the only country that was invaded or is Poland's ""apartheid"" something that the citizens of other states needed to suffer for?

What is there to explain? You already know how they intended to polanise the area by treating them like 2nd class citizens, banning their languages and generally treating them like shit. You wouldn't have a right to an opinion on the subject if you didn't.

&gt; It's dubious whether Hitler would have attacked Poland at all had he not gotten assurances from the Soviet Union that there would be no conflict if they could steal the other half of the country.

How on earth did you come to the conclusion that Hitler was afraid of a conflict with a country he literally invaded later on?

&gt; The Soviets killed people and claiming the opposite is just whitewashing their crimes!

Yes, so did literally every single nation that fought in WW2. You understand what a war fundamentally is, right? Do you need an adult?

""You mean sacrificing their people with careless tactics?"" They made brave sacrifices for the greater good. You're trying to frame that as a bad thing. It isn't. Fighting the Nazis was heroic on all fronts.

If there is no link to be made (both legally and for all practical purposes) between firearms and personal (Czech Republic, Slovakia) or collective (Switzerland, Finland) safety, then the hoplophobic viewpoint becomes understandable.

On the other hand, for most Czechs having a firearm is (1) symbol of liberty (given the lengths to which Nazis and Communists went to confiscate them) and (2) personal protection tool (250K/306K licensed owners have CCW license - many of the remaining have gun for protection at home but thought that CCW level of licensing is too difficult for them so have home defense gun at their bedside formally for ""collecting"" purposes).

4563,"Here are relevant excerpts from the book Worse Than War by Daniel Goldhagen about why the Third Reich was so evil and worse than any other regime in history:

&gt;The Germans’ mass murdering can be seen as the emblematic instance of our age’s mass slaughters, not because of this mythologized view but because of its real character. Even though the Germans did not kill the most people, they were our age’s most omnivorous killers, exterminating the greatest variety of victims and, upon conquering the main areas of intended destruction, they killed the most people on average per year of all mass-murdering regimes. Equally significant, the Germans’ mass murdering encompassed virtually all facets of mass elimination and its annihilationist variant.

&gt;The Germans killed abroad as imperial conquerors, decimating the peoples living in large swaths of Eastern Europe, so that Germans could Germanify the conquered territories. And they perpetrated domestic slaughters. They killed as self-conceived apocalyptic warriors. And they killed as calculating Machiavellian overlords. They destroyed populations with the passion of fanatical belief. And they killed for cool reasons of realpolitik. For them, mass murder was often an end in itself. And they responded to rebellion with mass murder as a deterrent to future challenges. They killed with the most time-tested and primitive methods. And they innovated and built death factories. They slaughtered their victims in the cruelest manner. And they killed them clinically, with gas or lethal injection. They killed their victims face-to-face. And they killed them from a distance. They murdered in the most planned and organized way. And they killed in an impromptu way, with every German in Eastern Europe allowed to be judge and executioner of dehumanized people. They killed some categories of people comprehensively. And they killed others selectively. They killed people because of their putative individual biological characteristics (the mentally ill and physically handicapped), social and national identities (which they conceived of in racial terms), and political allegiances. In these annihilationist and eliminationist campaigns, the Germans used every conceivable violent eliminationist means, from brutally repressing and enslaving, to deporting large populations, to incarcerating people in camps, to preventing reproduction by sterilizing them, to decapitating peoples by destroying their elites, to slaughtering entire populations...

&gt;Why did the Germans’ annual mass-murder rate exceed, indeed dwarf, the others’ already colossal rates? Unlike that of the various communist murderers and the Japanese, the Germans’ creed was explicitly annihilationist . As a core matter of ideology and policy it called for the elimination, with a lethal reflexiveness, of tens of millions (eventually probably hundreds of millions) of people. Unlike the communists, the Germans did not want to rehabilitate people they incorporated through conquest, because they grounded most of their victims’ undesirability in their imputed racial and biologically based inferiority and perniciousness. The Germans’ proactive plans to annihilate an itemized list of more than eleven million Jews, their official programs to slaughter those they deemed mentally ill and developmentally disabled, their general exterminationist drive against Sinti and Roma, their wanton murder of millions in Poland and the Soviet Union fundamentally differentiated them in two respects from the communists.

&gt;First, when the Nazis and all those Germans following them surveyed the map of Europe and beyond, they saw peoples to be destroyed, violently subjugated, enslaved, or somehow eliminated. When the communists gazed upon their relevant maps, they did not particularly covet others’ territory or think it must be cleared of human impediments. They did not see peoples in all directions to be destroyed. But they did see people they had to transform, to fit their mold, which meant possibly sacrificing a substantial number for the greater good. Indeed, their Marxist social theory, whatever its substantial pathologies and inhumanity, sought positive social transformation through economic restructuring and change. They (except the Khmer Rouge) did not, as the Nazis did, study these maps with general murder in their eyes.

&gt;The second difference followed from the first: killing’s motive and consequent manner. The communists—though not the Japanese—killed human beings in their understanding of humanity’s cause, envisioning a beneficent communist future for all humanity—thriving, having plenty, and living in freedom and harmony. This vision of humanity was an ideologically driven fantasia and therefore foundationally unreal and unrealizable, requiring inhumane means, with inhumane, indeed catastrophically inhumane results. But this is a far cry from the Germans’ annihilationist ethos and practice seeking to place one race above all others, to refashion all human society according to a racial biological, draconian cast and slave system, and to kill vast numbers practically for its own sake. Hence, the Germans’ far greater murderousness, its different quality. Slaughtering people on a scale unparalleled in human history came to the Germans during the Nazi period as easily and reflexively as swatting flies. The Germans actively killed most of their victims as part of an explicit exterminationist policy, by shooting, gassing, and purposely starving them to death.

&gt;The communists killed most or even the vast majority of their victims with catastrophic, ideologically induced, and cockeyed economic policies, using humans as production factors, or sacrificing human beings for humanity’s good or history’s march. The Soviets executed perhaps around 10 percent of their more than eight million killed. Had Mao not hatched his murderous Great Leap Forward economic scheme, then millions, indeed perhaps twenty million more Chinese, would not have died. None of this makes these regimes’ murderousness any less murderous than the murderousness of others, or their victims’ deaths any less morally condemnable, significant, or meaningful. But unlike those of the other colossally mass eliminationist and murderous regimes, the Nazis’ drive to slaughter people was organic to their ideology with its racist-biological conception of humanity and human worth and its concomitant drive for racial purity, expansion, and dominance. It was an ideology of destruction.

&gt;Had the Germans won the war, they would have slaughtered the five million additional Jews documented at Wannsee and, if able to, Jews beyond Europe, especially in the United States. They would have slaughtered everywhere mentally ill and developmentally disabled people; all people they called Gypsies; and Poles, Ukrainians, Russians, and other peoples to their east in the tens of millions, as they refashioned the Eurasian continent and humanity. They would have slaughtered, or prevented the birth of, children, as the biological seeds of peoples they wanted to destroy or numerically control, or considered superfluous. As they moved into Africa and Asia, they would have slaughtered or let perish untold millions of various subhumans, Asians being deemed racial cripples and blacks semi-apes. 
Had the Germans prevailed, they would have destroyed civilization and humanity as we know it. 

&gt;If the communists were a heresy on Western civilization, accepting many of its fundamental values and tenets if in a perverted way, the Nazis were an apostasy, seeking its destruction and replacement by a German racial dominion, a world of masters and, of those permitted to live, mainly slaves. After seventy years of communist rule, Russia, Ukraine, the Baltics, and elsewhere, countries and peoples resumed control of their futures. After almost half a century of Soviet domination in Central Europe, in Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and elsewhere, the countries’ peoples emerged intact and educated, and able to pick up, much the poorer in many ways, where they had been nationally and culturally. Had the Nazis ruled these same lands for half or three quarters of a century, no Ukraine or Ukrainian people, no Poland or Polish people, no Russia or Russian people would have been left to resuscitate. The Germans would have repopulated their lands with colonists, slaughtered and enslaved their peoples, obliterated their religions and churches, their cultures and communities. The Germans developed plans to begin this vast systematic destruction, most notably the General Plan for the East, and had in almost no time already started to implement their desires. After half a century or more under a victorious Nazi Germany, European, Western, even pre-Nazi German civilization, would have been destroyed, unrecognizable, incapable of resurrection. Such was Nazism’s caesura with Western civilization. Such was its unparalleled destructiveness.",,/r/europe/comments/o5dtrv/on_this_day_in_1941_nazi_germany_began_a_massive/h2niaad/,Cmyers1980,1624370698

4628,"&gt; It's true that the newest wind power contracts, signed in the years after Hinkley was given the go ahead, are substantially lower. 

And within 20 years they'll all be replaced, so they'll all be lower. And that's assuming the older turbines aren't replaced sooner with up-to-date new models because they're in the best spots.

Meanwhile, Hinkley Point will still be paid the prices from now.

&gt;First, we are having to pay for battery storage to provide frequency response. Thermal generators (including nuclear) provide inertia, which keeps the grid frequency stable. Wind and solar do not, so consumers are now paying for battery storage.

Thermal inertia is a bad thing, it makes it harder to deal with supply and demand changes on the grid. Thermal plants still need flexible power to maintain grid balance. It's not a competitive advantage compared to renewables.

&gt;Second, we have to pay for spare capacity for when wind speeds drop. Because wind is systemically variable (it can range from over 15 GW to less than 0.1 GW in the UK), we have to pay for gas and diesel power plants to remain available.

You always need that, nuclear plants aren't that reliable either. You still need to have those even with a nuclear base for the grid.

&gt;Third, we have to pay for grid reinforcement because wind power tends to be generated far away from where the demand is.

Nuclear power suffers from the same flaw: centralized generation that has to be distributed outward.

&gt;The end result is that the actual costs for wind are much higher than the headline costs, but because they are levied on the consumer, rather than the generator, they are hidden.

You underestimate how much the costs of renewables have dropped. Levelized costs per kWh are 3-4 times than those of nuclear power. That does not even include waste storage/decommissioning costs for nuclear power. Unless nuclear can make do with 20% of the flexible capacity

And then we need a talk about the hidden costs of nuclear: the decomissioning and waste storage costs, the implicit insurance they're getting for free. All paid for by the taxpaery.

&gt;We can meet our carbon targets with nuclear. We cannot with wind and solar.

[Europe can reach net-zero by 2050 with 100% renewables, study shows](https://reneweconomy.com.au/europe-can-reach-net-zero-by-2050-with-100-renewables-study-shows-70792/)

If we look at the construction times of the recent nuclear projects in Europe, it's clear that they cannot be constructed fast enough to begin with, and that's ignoring all the problems of funding and procuring the fuel supply - which isn't enough either to provide such a large volume even for a nuclear reactor fleet of sufficient size.

&gt;The UK and Germany, despite spending a fortune on wind and solar, do not have any concrete plans to reduce emissions to the level France has been achieving for decades.

Both the UK and Germany have been historically coal-reliant. That's path dependency for you.

France, in turn, plans to reduce its nuclear generation in favor of renewables, because its newest nuclear projects are dismal failures.",Limburg,/r/europe/comments/o4sse8/if_we_want_to_fight_the_climate_crisis_we_must/h2n57jt/,silverionmox,1624363310

4638,"Oh boy, I'll try to find it somewhere, I don't entirely remember where I read these. Fwiw the 1945 timetable refers to Germans starting the war at all, whereas the 1946 timetable refers to about when Soviets expected they'd be ready for another war in Europe. Iirc Military History Visualized mentions this in one of his videos, and I think either Glantz or Stahel made the same claim too. Maybe it was Kershaw, I'm all mixed up :P

The sort of critical mistake here was a genuine belief that Germany would not open another front until Britain collapsed. This was originally the case, but Germany's failure to blockade Britain caused a change in strategy; they would instead defeat Britain by depriving it of its options, #1 being the USSR's entry into the war.

But it's easier to understand Stalin's position when you get that he was constantly being flooded with misinformation, esp from the British, that he was in a treaty with Germany that the Soviets were following to a T, and that the Soviets were still reorganizing and were desperate to not spark a war, and so did everything possible to not antagonize the Germans.

The invasion of Poland was preceded by a political crisis, followed by an ultimatum, and only after led to war. The Soviets expected similar forewarning. Barbarossa there was no crisis, no ultimatum, not even a declaration of war for many hours. The Soviets simply had no reason to think Germany would invade.

Science has given us conservationist biology, and unlike wolves we have the ability to harvest renewable resources like wood and pulp from the woods without harming the environment. In fact, the cycle of harvest and regrowth actually increases the health of the ecosystem and its productivity in binding carbon dioxide.  
  
In the past, humanity has had some severely deleterious effects on the environment, and one result of this is that we've become vital conservationists. Without hunters, populations of ruminants could grow out of proportion and endanger the plants they feed off. With the huge prey population, predators like wolves will also grow out of control. When the ruminants begin to starve, so will the wolves, and the collateral damage would be enormous.

Not only is it pretty bad reporting to only talk to one side, but this one is a very small and particular group of people. 66% of people have always hated Janša and 25% have been and still are part of his personality cult. Their assertions are pretty hollow as he's been leading their party for 30 years unopposed. Janša is more brazen about his views now, but even in 2011 there was ""the state shouldn't be helping people in poverty, there's plenty of still good food in the bins outside"". People like Žiga Turk are from the class of SDS party members who were pushed out because Janša cannot let anyone in the party become too influential. He doesn't even have straw candidates for party leadership, it's been him unopposed since 1995. Every cycle he has favourites within his party like kings had in their royal court, but they get replaced with new ones by the next election. The New York Times reporter has decided to construct his narrative around ""Janša unpopular because he's losing sane supporters"" and has used these disaffected former favourites to make it. This is in my opinion inaccurate, he is not losing his supporters (his coalition parties are though), rather part of the apathetic/apolitical section of the public that ""doesn't care, thinks politics don't matter, thinks the status quo is good"" has woken up against him and some of the centrist politicians who were willing to support his government for personal gain have been pushed too far by him so they joined the opposition.",Slovenia,/r/europe/comments/o5hz5r/populist_leaders_in_eastern_europe_run_into_a/h2mw5ie/,Dark_Enoby,1624355992

4763,"It's easy to make such hypotheticals but consider that after the intervention you describe they would still have had a strong and united Germany to deal with. Unless you think that Britain and France would have been capable and willing to maintain a military occupation and division of Germany which the US and USSR did historically?

So you are back to square 1 - a powerful and united Germany, even more resentful of Franco-British domination of Europe, and likely a breeding ground for further extremism, militarism and revanchism. This was the mistake of Versailles - a settlement not harsh enough to actually impair Germany in the long term, but harsh enough to cause massive resentment. 

It was only the complete devastation of WW2 and the sustained occupation and denazification of Germany post-1945, which resulted in the modern pacifistic democratic Germany we see today. Do you really think that would have been achievable by France and Britain attacking the Nazis over the remilitarisation of the Rhineland in 1936? I doubt it very much. 

Not to mention that the Allies, especially the French, were doctrinally incapable of an offensive war against Germany. And they were understandably gripped by a fear of war in the 1930s. The French and British politicians and public had experienced the horror of WW1 and were determined at almost any cost to avoid it again. Especially as their military advisers were saying that aerial warfare would result in colossal civilian casualties and devastation. 

So I take your point but it's difficult to envisage that scenario playing out any better in the long term - it would likely have just delayed the final reckoning.

4833,"Ok then, lets imagine a scenario. Picture an ethnic group consisting of 1 million people inhabiting lands that just got conquered. The conquered are called Blongs and the conquerors are called Blurgs.

Lets say that the Blurgs are assholes, terrible terrible villains that want to cement their rule over this newly conquered area. So what do they do? They round up any able bodied Blong men and shoot them dead. Just to make sure, their families are also shot dead. Anyone who opposes Blurg rule also gets shot and their entire community dies with them as punishment. After 20 years of this brutal oppression the Blurgs realise no one is left to rebel against them in the area, and blong lands are firmly integrated into their empire. Finally their stop their mass murders. 400 000or 40% of Blongs lay dead.

Now, imagine scenario 2. The blurgs invade, but they are motivated by a sense of ratial superiority. They think that the blongs have no right to live, and in fact by killing them theyre doing them a favor. They have the same policy of killing dissenters as in the earlier scenario, but they also think that killing ALL blongs should be a goal so that their land can be inhabited by blurgs. For the sake of argument,lets also say that no one is coming to liberate the blongs either-theyre completely alone. So, not only does the same 40% of blongs die like in scenario 1, but add the fact that the Blurgs want ALL of them dead, so they bring the old, the young and the infirm indiscriminately into gas chambers to kill them. Its not a matter of killing those who resist and people related to them, its about erasing the blongs from existance whatsoever. In the end, after only 2 or 3 years about 950000 or 95% of blongs die, the survivors have all escaped or hidden.

Brownmiller points out that Nazis used rape as a weapon of terror.

Most importantly, it doesn't have any history of being predominantly eastern orthodox.

Before the cold war, most of the states the UN defines as ""Eastern Europe"" were *never* thought of as such precisely because the idea of ""East/West"" Europe was originally a millennia old religious border. Why does it matter? Because east and west Christian nations had very different medieval and early modern history from each other, and they have far more in common with their own side of that border.

Also here it states ""Order No. 227 also stipulated the capture or shooting of ""cowards"" and fleeing panicked troops at the rear the blocking detachments, who in the first three months shot 1,000 penal troops and sent 24,993 to penal battalions.[10]"" this shows, like I stated, the blocking units killed some men (used in a relative way as 1000 is not a small number most of the time) while arresting most of the men and sent them to penal units.

The Crown and Poldark could be scythed from European TV screens as EU targets ‘post-Brexit imperialism’

Hit shows made in Britain labelled a threat ‘cultural diversity’, as Brussels plans to limit their appearances on TV and streaming services

Harry Yorke, Whitehall Editor
21 June 2021 • 4:35pm
Hit British programmes such as The Crown dominate streaming services
Britain has hit back at an EU plan to slash the “disproportionate” number of British TV and films shown in Europe. 

The European Commission has been asked to carry out an impact study on the risk of British cultural imperialism, in possible first step towards tough rules banning UK shows from screens.

British dominance on TV and streaming services, thanks to hit shows such as The Crown and Downton Abbey, was described as a threat to Europe’s “cultural diversity” in a leaked EU document. 

The commission impact study could be a first step towards regulations to cut down the number of UK shows, which could have ramifications on fundraising for future British blockbusters. 

A Whitehall source accused Brussels of ""cutting off their nose to spite their face"" to punish the UK for having the temerity to quit the bloc. 

Such was EU anger at Brexit, the source said, Brussels was willing to deprive Europeans of feel good romantic comedies such as Bridget Jones’ Diary or brooding, sensual and sumptuous period dramas like Poldark.

""The reason people watch and like our content is because it's enjoyable and good to watch,"" the Whitehall source said. ""They aren't acting in their audiences' best interests.”

EU member states have long had quotas for European TV programmes and films to protect from competition from popular English language American shows. 

Under Brussels’ audiovisual media services directive, 30 per cent of programmes on services like Netflix and Amazon Prime and most terrestrial programming must be “European works”.

France, which struggles with status anxiety due to English’s status as the Continent’s lingua franca, goes further and sets a 60 per cent quota on streaming services.

Last year, 22 per cent of films and TV series shown on streaming platforms in Europe were from the EU-27. The European Audiovisual Observatory said 8 per cent came from the UK and 2 per cent from other European countries.

A senior government source told the Telegraph that any EU move to disqualify British programmes as “European works” could be met with legal action. 


The UK remains a member of the Council of Europe, which is not an EU body, and the European convention on Transfrontier Television of the Council of Europe. 

The EU regulation refers to that convention, which means UK lawyers could argue that British works still qualify as “European” despite Brexit.  

“In our view the UK continues to qualify because we are signatories of the Council of Europe and the convention on trans-frontier television,” the government source said. There are 20 other non-EU members of the Council of Europe, which was founded in 1949 and includes countries such as Russia and Turkey. 

The shot across Britain’s bows will only exacerbate tensions in the UK-EU relationship, which are already strained by the threat of a trade war over sausages and Northern Ireland. 

There have also been rows over fishing rights, which saw the Royal and French navy dispatched to Jersey and vaccine supplies since the UK left the transition period on December 31.",,/r/europe/comments/o5f8dp/eu_plans_to_limit_number_of_british_tv_show_and/h2mh9qa/,CaravanOfDeath,1624341984

5008,"The fighting involved millions of Axis and Soviet troops along the broadest land front in military history. It was by far the deadliest single theatre of the European portion of World War II with up to 8.7 - 10 million military deaths on the Soviet side. Estimated civilian deaths range from about 14 to 17 million.

The huge death toll was attributed to several factors, including brutal mistreatment of POWs and captured partisans, the large deficiency of food and medical supplies in Soviet territories, and atrocities committed mostly by the Germans against the civilian population. The multiple battles and the use of scorched earth tactic, destroyed agricultural land, infrastructure, and whole towns, leaving much of the population homeless and without food.

Adolf Hitler had argued in his autobiography for the necessity of Lebensraum (""living space""): acquiring new territory for Germans in Eastern Europe, in particular Russia. He envisaged settling Germans there, as according to Nazi ideology the Germanic people constituted the master race, while exterminating or deporting most of the existing inhabitants and using the remainder as slave labour. Hitler as early as 1917 had referred to the Russians as inferior, believing that the Bolshevik Revolution had put the Jews in power over the mass of Slavs, who were, in Hitler's opinion, incapable of ruling themselves and had thus ended up being ruled by Jewish masters.

In September 1941, Erich Koch was appointed to the Ukrainian Commissariat. His opening speech was clear about German policy: ""I am known as a brutal dog ... Our job is to suck from Ukraine all the goods we can get hold of ... I am expecting from you the utmost severity towards the native population.""

Belarus lost a quarter of its pre-war population. The Nazis imposed a brutal regime, deporting some 380,000 young people for slave labour, and killing hundreds of thousands (civilians) more. More than 209 cities and towns (out of 270 total) and 9,000 villages were destroyed. Himmler pronounced a plan according to which 3⁄4 of the Belarusian population was designated for ""eradication"" and 1⁄4 of the racially 'cleaner' population (blue eyes, light hair) would be allowed to serve Germans as slaves.

It is estimated that between 2.25 and 3.3 million Soviet POWs died in Nazi custody, out of 5.25–5.7 million.

It would be no exaggeration to say that the war affected every family in Russia and all former Soviet republics and that its legacy has had an impact on successive generations of Soviets and Russians. Forty years after the war, in 1981, Soviet war veteran and poet Yuri Levitansky wrote:

«I don’t still dwell on that past war,

the war still dwells inside of me,

But politicians are stating how Serbia has a good average salary in comparison to the neighbouring countries and that is going up. Those with 250€ a month are always stressed and think how to stretch those 250€ till next salary and thus easily manipulated by the politicians as they can't see beyond their immediate problems.

Saying cultures exist in a continuum doesn't invalidate anything at all, because borders have always been and will always be drawn based on subjective opinions of the people. Many parts of northern Italy (ST and Trentino excluded in this example cause it's self-explanatory) are more similar to Austria than they are to southern Italy in terms of culture, yet you'd rather put northern Italy in a category with southern italy than with Austria. Why is that? Cause of your subjective opinions, which i totally understand and support. After all northern italians and southern italians are still both italians and austrians are not. All that's really happening here, with these categorisations is ""outsiders"" putting a label on ""insiders"" and if the insiders accept then it's real, if they don't accept then it's not.

The total number of deaths was published by Rosstat and Civil institutions since the very beggining of tha pandemic. No editions were made to those numbers.

The confusion rose from the number reported by health ministry. The source of this confusion was that they counted covid death only by including the direct death from covid revealed by the autopsy.

5215,"You clearly have no idea how authocracies or dictatorships work. its not one person ruling alone and everyone just obeying.

The Ruler has a huge power base of clients he has to keep happy because they are the ones that actually keep him in power and are enforcing his rule. One of the reason why a lot of dictatorships struggle economically is because the dictator has to shift a lot of ressources from the country to his most important supporters to keep him alive/in charge/not start a coup.

Economic sanctions intend to tackle this very problem of any dictatorship. If the economy goes entirely to shits the dictator can no longer fund his clients and they get uneasy and might thing about overthrowing him or simply removing the style of gouvernment in general to get back to their previous wealth with a ""new gouernment"". The only ones that will propably stay loyal to the bitter end are the main body of the domestic security bureau because they usually commited crimes in the name of the dictator that would result in them beeing put on trial after its fall. We see this in nearly all dicatorships that fell during the eastern block where the security forces resisted the longest against any change (romania 1991 for example) or...well...the SS during WW2. 

It is similar to how US president canidadtes have to make ""the round"" to all their potential clients that can get them inot office or make that step vastly easier. No finances or political backing by others and you are fucked.

Belarus has the advantage of having an external money supply in form of Russia though. But if Belarus cant sustain itself economically anymore and costs more and more of Russias ressources, like any client, they might thing of cutting their loses and try to create a favorouble situation with a potential new gouvernment.

Basically Lukashenko has to pay of his domestic clients and keep enough economy alive to not be a big burden/money sink on Russia.

Yeah I bet they did... because they're gonna turn it into a private business to make them profits.

The fact that these sites were left to rot IS reprehensible, but the solution is to actually put in the maintenance they need, not to completely change their purpose and remodel them to fit a company's needs.

World Heritage sites are a sacrifice. They're places of cultural or historical significance that we're supposed to protect and care for so future generations get to enjoy them.

The people are accostumed to the term of Spanish empire to refer to the territories belonging to the Spanish crown and it's fine. we also talk about the British empire despite there never being an emperor of the empire, heck we call it the second french empire and it was a republic for a time. Empire is often used for any entity with disparate enough groups of people or one ruled by an emperor. The case of Spain is the first, not the second the only emperor of Spain there ever was was Charles I and he was emperor of the holy Roman EMPIRE.
  
The *Spanish empire* was never a centralised state under the Habsburgs and the same you've said about Portugal could be said about the territories of the crown of Aragon, the low countries, Milan, naples, etc. 
  
The King of Spain figure...didn't even exist, they referred to themselves as king of the Spain**S**, because Aragon was a different entity from castille, just as much as Portugal. For example castille was the one who signed up Tordesillas not Aragon, laws were different and much more. You couldn't prosecute a criminal in Aragon for a crime that happened in Castille.
  
As such it's a bit awkward to talk about the Spanish empire and discard the kingdom of Portugal because it wasn't the exception...it was the norm (heck it was even considered changing the capital to Lisbon) 
  
The ""Spanish empire"" was a collection of kingdoms, dutchies, etc all ruled by one king. The whole Reason why it was called an EMPIRE was because of this disparate arrange.",Spain,/r/europe/comments/o4818i/the_countries_most_active_in_the_transatlantic/h2ko3oj/,alikander99,1624305574

You're starting from the base assumption that everyone owns and wants to use their own private car to get everywhere they can.

In any way, it wasn't a situation where entering the school was needed as hostages also do say, and it was a choice not some way to assure that now the school was going to be bombed to the ground and they should save as much as they can. Maskhadov also could have taken out many if not all, as former Ingush president taken out some himself at the beginning. At any case, he was the best chance - which Russian authorities had denied. 

Of course, IEDs weren't planned for dismantling; it was whether some of their demands were met, or hostages put into dire conditions where Russian authorities would be forced to accept at leash a partial ceasefire.

This is the opposite of truth.

&gt; They sold and donated better weapons to Armenia

At least in the Russian-language Wikipedia I can see that Azerbaijan got a vastly bigger arsenal from the Soviet depots and units on its territory than Armenia. 

Can't say about Armenia and Azerbaijan buying and otherwise getting weapons later, but this is unlikely to have had an effect on the end result of the war - until late 1993 Russia didn't support Armenia, and by then Azerbaijan started losing anyway.

5847,"&gt;SD actually did have a member of the National-Socialist German Worker's Party and SS veteran as one of its founders and elected the same man to its first party secretary.  
&gt;  
&gt;And this was in the late 80's, early 90's mind you. Right at the time most of the higher party members joined up.

I'm aware. Since I'm no mind reader I can't say whether the old parts of the current leadership joined with the intent of ""civilizing"" the party, if they changed as they got older, or if they actually think Hitler was actually a pretty swell guy and they're just hiding it. Regardless, while I don't care for them much the current SD certainly isn't a nazi party by any stretch of the definition and from a purely pragmatic standpoint it's not viable for a political system like ours to have a 20-25% ""black hole"" in the voting block so I'm fine with letting them in for the time being. I imagine in practice they'll find out that actually being in the government is a lot harder than just complaining about someone else being in the government, so they'll probably shrink way down again.

Not unlike MP, they've consistently been a very effective opposition party but they've also been pretty horrible when they've actually been in the government.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Whatever else they are, they are evidently close enough to the german Nazi party that they are fine with being led by a member of their ranks. So if somehow Hitler had escaped to Sweden and survived into the 90's it might not be fair to say they would accept all of his policies but he could have become party secretary.  
&gt;  
&gt;So they're not just a generic populist right wing party. They are very much a party from the ""nazi scene"".

**HEC Paris takes top position with other grandes écoles retaining high positions in annual assessment of courses**

French business schools led by HEC Paris are the best places to study a masters in finance degree around the world, with strong continued demand despite the disruption of coronavirus, according to the FT’s latest annual assessment.

The top five of the leading nine providers of the MiF qualification offered to those without prior professional experience are based in France, as well as a further four among the 55 total schools included in the 2021 rankings.

The performance of HEC Paris is significantly driven by the high salaries paid to the international alumni hired by global banking and investment recruiters, who are drawn to France’s competitive elite education system and its notable strength in quantitative skills.

“We’re happy we could come top again,” said Eloïc Peyrache, HEC Paris’s dean, who was appointed at the start of this year. “Our finance department is very strong, and we have a global audience. The quality of students is very good and the number of candidates is rising.”

The school has ranked first in the FT’s MiF ranking nine times over the past decade, ahead of other leading French business schools this year including ESCP, Skema, Essec and Edhec, all of which are among the country’s elite grandes écoles.

London Business School retains its leading position for the smaller number of MiF courses tailored to those who have already worked in the field before studying, ahead of University of Cambridge: Judge, Amsterdam Business School and Singapore Management University: Lee Kong Chian.

Europe dominates in the provision of the MiF courses, although three Chinese business schools — Tsinghua University School of Economics and Management, Shanghai Advanced Institute of Finance at SJTU and Peking University Guanghua — performed well this year.

US business schools remain dominant in MBAs, but four were also listed in this year’s FT MiF ranking.

Current demand for places, recruitment of graduates and salaries for alumni have held up compared with previous years, despite the disruption of the pandemic. The average salary for alumni three years after completing their pre-experience MiF rose in 2021 to $85,858 from $83,404.
