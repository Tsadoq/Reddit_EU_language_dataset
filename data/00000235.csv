3,"Ehh.... the article is leaning towards sound bite nitpick. It was foolish of her to say D\-Day so close to ""strong relationship with the government of Germany.""

Transcript: **""Looking back in the history books, today is the 71st anniversary of the speech that announced the Marshall Plan. Tomorrow is the anniversary of the D\-Day invasion. We obviously have a very long history with the government of Germany, and we have a strong relationship with the government of Germany.""**

The Marshall Plan is her example of a ""strong relationship with the government of Germany."" D\-day is her example of ""a very long history with the government of Germany."" She jumbled her order and was vague. The media and the public will NOT give you the benefit of the doubt, unfortunately for her. This is why politicians and diplomats tightly regulate their speech, with the exception of Trump. 

 I hypothesize she may have been trying to imply that our relationship with Germany morphed from foe to ally, akin to our relations with other current day allies (e.g. UK, Japan, Italy). 

All in all, this is a pretty immaterial event. But I guess it gives one another reason to criticize the Trump admin. ",,/r/europe/comments/8pfsc9/trump_official_ridiculed_for_saying_dday_is_an/e0b8xwa/,calpolylurker1,1528435141

25,"&gt; I agree that some of the data turned out to be false but that is because Saddam repeatedly lied through out his career and refused to let inspectors verify things that he repeatedly agreed to let them verify.

Really? To everyone else it looked like lying to your population and your allies to get them in line for a war that is still not ending with the results of more terrorists in the world then ever before and millions of refugees flooding Europe since more then a decade. 

&gt; I agree that growing up in Iraq or Afghanistan makes it easy to hate any non islamic people and also many islamic people of different sects. The root cause here is their culture and teachings and that is based on islam. 

Well, the first terrorists i learned to know were from the IRA, the RAF and the ETA. The same goes for almost any country bombed and invaded by the Nazis. Lots of ""Terrorists"" from the right point of view.

Its very easy to put their violence on their culture, and i even agree to some degree. Their believes make their crimes much more brutal. But the urge for revenge and to hit someone you perceive as attacker/invader as hard as possible, was always there. 

The only way to circumvent that is not to invade random countries with a population that does not want you there. If you do it anyway it would be pretty rational to accept that they don't like you as much as you want them to like you and that they are going to try to take revenge. 

Blaming it on culture and people makes it easier for you - because you free yourself from any responsibility and guilt - but it also shows that you think you're better then them. This does help neither you nor them. In the end you find it easier to slaughter them - because you perceive them as subhuman and worthless - and they hate you even more in return.

What I mean with connected buildings is what we have e.g. in Museokatu, Tark'ampujankatu and basically all of central Helsinki (and other old cities in Europe) where there is no space unless there is a road.

The other parts of Munkkiniemi have a clearly different, less urban feel to it.

In Helsinki e.g. this distinction separates the areas that have a lot or restaurants, cafes, small shops, bars etc. from the areas that are basically strictly for people to live in.

159,"&gt;AND it was a massive expenditure of Money. 20 MILLION € to have some pseudo ""Fachwerkhäuser"" in Chinese colour themes (red-green-gold. Not that I have anything against the colour theme, but it just doesn't fit with pre industrial german Arcitecture).

20 million is quite modest given that around 40 new buildings were constructed, and that private investors footed most of the bill. If the area had been developed as originally intended (i.e. ultra-modern) it probably would have cost more. Most skyscrapers in the city cost between 200-400 million euros to construct.

200 million is often thrown around, but this is incorrect, as it includes the construction of an underground car park, the restructuring/rebuilding of the station, and infrastructure upgrades. All of which were going to have to happen anyway, as the city had long planned to demolish the Technisches Rathaus and redevelop the area. 

All reconstructed buildings were done so in their original colours, so I don't really see your Chinese argument.

166,"There are infinite varieties of trash, depending on the composition

Some have positive value (you have to pay to get it), some have negative value (you get paid to take it)

Positive value stems from recycling or energy recovery operations, negative value stems from sorting costs, transport costs, recycling and recovery costs and possibly landfill costs

Both the extent of the positive and the extent of the negative value differ depending on the infrastructure available. Sweden has highly advanced recycling operations and capacity and highly advanced incineration plants for energetic recovery and they will be able to unlock a much higher amount of positive value from the same trash.

This leads to imports to Sweden, especially for positive value trash (recyclable or energy-dense trash).

For negative value trash (unrecyclable or completely unsorted waste), companies are obviously trying to minimize costs. The easiest way to do that tends to be illegal maneuvers in countries like Poland. 

By neglecting the law, Polish companies can achieve a very low negative value for trash that would be pretty expensive to get rid of in countries with functioning environmental law enforcement and import a lot of waste which they put it in problematic landfills.",Yurop,/r/europe/comments/8p7wnr/major_danger_for_europeans_health_garbage_from/e0b5jv3/,yuropman,1528430768

253,"I mean, that quote is absolute bullshit. Let's take it apart:

""The EU will mass monitor and censor"". That is incorrect. If the directive passes ""as is"", the EU will force all platforms to monitor and censor copyrighted materials in the style of YouTube upload filters. The EU will not monitor or censor anything.

""even material that is currently considered fair use such as links and quotes"" A: The mere use of the term ""fair use"" when talking about European copyright law disqualifies the author from serious discussion. B: Links will never be copyrighted C: The copyright exception for quotes would indeed be narrowed. In the future, quotes would only be freely usable for the purposes of journalistic dissemination or public debate. They would no longer be freely usable for ""previews"" by news aggregators, you would have to actually click the link to see the content (unless the news aggregators pay the news creators).

""This will mean only very large companies and media organizations will soon be able provide news as only they can afford to pay these copyright fees"". That is absolute bullshit. The copyright fees scale linearly with the size of the organisation, a large organisation that has to pay 20 million for 1 billion views is hit just as much as a small organisation that has to pay 20 thousand for 1 million views. The law does have monopolisation issues, but those lie in the implementation of upload filters and in the monopolisation of copyright ownership (possibly a la GEMA)

Merkel, Macron, Juncker and others talk about how Europe lags in innovations field behind China and USA. Well, best way to cut that lag is to limit information flow. Not only that, give us more acts that will make research even harder.

The EU is currently suing both USA and China in WTO, so it is also not a matter of EU courting China to spite USA (no matter what Trump says).

Also very notable is that USA ended up canceling many of the Chinese tariffs, after a conspicuous $500 million loan by China to a Trump hotel project.

I think this is as close as the EU will get to the Australian solution for asylum seekers. The basic idea is that we'll only accept people who have been granted asylum and everyone else will not be able to enter the EU. Those who go to the EU to apply for asylum would then be transported to that place. This would then hopefully deter immigration.

But the whole idea rests on the assumption that some nation will be willing to have this facility on their territory.

I am not sure what the plans for Lithuania were specifically. If Hitler felt there was some kinship between Lithuanians and Germans and that you would not have been too resistant to Germanizing, then you might not have seen significant ethnic cleansing happen to your population.

I think that there were numerous groups who were oppressed by the Soviets before the war broke out who felt they were ostensibly liberated by the Germans and those people might have felt a new sense of hope or perhaps, temporarily, their daily lives did become less difficult or tense. They of course didn't know what the Germans might have had in store for them. Germany never won the war and so they could not implement General Plan Ost, so some of those who preferred the German occupation were lucky and only experienced the lighter side of it.

515,"&gt;St. Peters Basilica is a clusterfuck though, you couldn't have brought up a worse example.  It's not really a good building.

I think you're probably in the minority there. 

&gt;Most of your arguments are easily refuted by the fact that we've had a technological revolution both in construction tech and code that literally made obsolete practically all old construction methods, 

So I guess the Romans shouldn't have built those Egyptian style temples in Egypt because you know....they had concrete and proper windows now. Those Romans, what uncultured morons with poor taste in art.

Who gives a shit what the interior structure is? That's a part of the building most people will *never* see, ever. When we're talking about the aesthetic aspect of a building the structural aspect shouldn't be a part of the discussion unless it's a bad structure.

Again like I said, the Capitol Building in D.C doesn't need those classical columns, it's built with steel, it can carry it's weight without them. But it's not a bad building because it borrows from older styles, because those older styles are good. If you were to take the classical columns away from the Capitol, away from the Lincoln Memorial, what would you have? Poor, uninspired buildings with no ambition. Good art, truly good art never becomes outdated, Roman architecture as an example has never been outdated.

Being stuck with the same type of art for perpetunity like you seem to want is actually breaking with precedent. No society in the history of the world has ever done this. What you're proposing is some kind of Commie Bloc type of idea where we should never do any kind of cultural exchange and just stick with the same sterile crap because that's what we build now.

The structure is what's there to support the building, it's there to keep it standing. A building's structure should not dictate what form it's decoration should take in an absolute sense. Architects should not be engineers.

&gt;Yeah, and thanks to that most streets in Europe basically all look the same in their neoclassical originality. So much for local heritage.

You're in the minority there too.

&gt;And they're crap and anything else,

Also in the minority there. Your opinion doesn't justify your argument that bringing back old styles shouldn't be done. I don't care if you *think* it's bad, I want to know *why* you think it's bad.

&gt;Also, that about doing it right is my point. Straight-up copying without any though behind it is not doing it right.

That's not your point because then I wouldn't disagree. Your point is that old styles should not be brought back *period*:

&gt;This is why it doesn't make sense to copy anymore, and we're just taking the form and putting it in a box of concrete, thus a fake.

I feel it's merely too broad an assessment. Generating energy from fossil fuels will always release carbon dioxide, yes. Thus, the equation you provided is correct for this particular instance.  

Having said that, you speaking of 'industry' and 'production of energy' without a specific qualifier (such as car industry, or internal combustion engines) removes a fair amount of context (as far as I am concerned), which in turn renders the statement untrue (i.e. I  simply have to point to the mere existence of alternatives such as nuclear fission/fusion, water turbines and so on to invalidate the statement.)

That would be stupendously stupid since alot of people who seek asylum claim persecution, fleeing war/terror etc. where they fear for their life and safety in their home country.

Appeals exist for a reason. No justice system is flawless and misstakes are bound to be made. And since most people would want a just and fair justice system that demands a fair and just appeal system where the person lodging the appeal can have it appealed in an orderly fashion before its finalized.

I think a more reasonable solution is that the court makes a judgement if the person is at ""flight"" risk of disapearing after having been denied. if the person is considered to be of such a risk they either put an electronic bracelet on him/her for monitoring purposes etc. or if they consider such an act inefficient they detain him/her while the appeal is made.

Say they then divert that spending to Indo-Pacific and spend $100 protecting the Pacific route to India and get $70 back in trade. That's less of a loss.

So they are still spending the same on defence - the difference is that they are not spending it in Europe, and they are making trade gains by diverting their spending.

924,"&gt; Basic standards of human rights, politeness and personal space are, for the most part, forgotten

Well, of course passengers have to be scanned and if necessary searched, how else are we to ensure someone doesn't carry a prohibited item on board?

&gt; All travelers are treated equally, as criminals, with search processes that are not dis-similar to entering a police cell or prison

Well, yes, again how else are you supposed to have innocence until proven guilty with situations like this?

'oh, terrorist brings a bomb on board, at least we now know he's guilty'

&gt; The process is unhygienic: security guards do not sanitize between pat downs, x-ray boxes are often unclean, passengers are often asked to walk in their socks through unclean facilities

I see your point, but this would waste so much time and money, airport security checks take long as is and the facilities are generally quite clean.

&gt; As security business has exploded the number of poorly trained security guards vastly outweighs the number of professional, well-trained security personnel. Many exhibit authoritarian disorders or are otherwise routinely abusive to passengers.

The horror stories you hear about the TSA and other security agencies aren't all that common in reality, you hear about it on the news and would assume this is some epidemic that happens everywhere, but they rarely do, millions do it each day without issue.

&gt; Security personnel are not held accountable for their actions, behavior or level of service

They are, and employees that abuse their position of power are fired.

&gt; Unprofessional conduct and misbehavior is difficult to prove as mobile devices are not available to passengers

You have other witnesses that can back you up if issues arise, take the Asian Doctor that was forcefully removed from that US flight

&gt; The knowledge that conversations cannot be recorded results in gross, routine and egregious misconduct

What example?

&gt; Sexual assault and minor invasions such as inappropriate touching are not uncommon

Depends on what you define as 'assault' or 'inappropriate touching', I agree it likely does happen, but I doubt it's common. And again, security employees have been fired for harassing/assaulting passengers.

&gt; Verbal abuse, including sexual abuse or simple provocation is not uncommon

Again, such as?

&gt; Airport travelers’ possessions are at risk: theft is not uncommon on the security belt, also it is unclear what happens to confiscated items, many items are confiscated without proper cause

Again, you'll have to provide examples, generally if airport security remove something from your luggage, they include a sheet of paper explaining why it was removed and who/what you can do, as long as you follow the rules, you shouldn't have issue, I've taken screws, tool-kits and other things on board with no issue, generally it has to be kept in the hold luggage (not carry on luggage), but this is detailed on the Airline's website that they do/don't accept.

&gt; The impact of scanning equipment on human health over the long-term is unknown

If scanners are found to damage human health, I'm sure they'll be banned.

&gt; The legal authority of airport security is unclear to passengers and totally unknown to security guards – try asking next time… also not easily available online

You can find this out on local Government and Airport websites.

&gt; If you complain or ask a basic question the response is typically unprofessional, aggressive and usually results in more extreme security vetting or “purposeful” inconvenience

I wouldn't let a few incidents, which sound mostly personal to you cloud your judgement and wish for the abolishment of airport security -- if you've had issues, contact the necessary authorities, courts, airports etc...

&gt; Airport security has been proven ineffective both in reality and in routine tests

Proof?

927,"deporting illegal immigrants is not a problem, it's quite logical. The point is what do they want to do to increase deportations? If the price for more deportation is changing the constitution or laws so that human rights are not applicable to non Swedish citizens, then I would have a problem with that. 

Deportations should be done with due diligence and respect for the legal procedures established by national law and international treaties. People have the right to apply for asylum and the state that receives the application ought to process the application without having to worry about preposterous thresholds made by politicians. It should be a decision driven by objective elements. 

Normally these alt right people see legal standards as an impediment to their narrative where there are simple solutions to complex problems and where democratic institutions like the judiciary should be submitted to the agenda of the executive power.

lol, you heard it here guys, international geopolitics isn't that hard! Listen man, when are you gonna become the UN general secretary? They could use you. 

&gt;I mean, isn't that the thing about ""good relations""? That you have influence and can get a favor from someone, because they like and trust you?

Traditionally speaking, yes Italy has gotten favours from Russia that maybe other countries haven't. The fact of the matter is, whether Crimea is Ukranian or Russia doesn't mean shit to the Italian state. There is no tangible benefit in supporting one or the other except that recognising it as Ukranian doesn't piss of the US. So Italy does that, but at the same time doesn't believe it to an extent where it hurts us economically. Hence, reduction (not elimination) of sanctions. 

&gt; ""Italy has good relations with Russia, we will make it show improvements""?

You don't have a flair, but assuming you're in Western Europe your country has a good relationship with the US. 

Can you name one decision in the US your country directly influenced?

Foreign relations don't work like that. 


Keeping with Italy, a good example to look at is Libya. Italy was always the closest to Ghaddafi because it was in our best interests to do so. And, it turns out, in the rest of Europe's interest too considering Berlusconi of all people had a deal with him to keep illegal migration under control. Then the US/UK and France get all war happy and take him out, against Italy's advice, and oh shit there's a migrant crisis. 

Making sensible, pragmatic foreign policy choices to defend *your* countries interests sometimes means making deals with unsavoury people/regimes. International geopolitics is the last place for idealism.

For example in 2015 Germany exported 562 ktons of hazardous waste (half of it to the netherlands) but imported 2685 ktons. In total waste it exported 3045 ktons and imported 6519 ktons, so they are a net importer.

On the other hand Great Britain exported 4616 ktons and imported 190ktons, so they are a net exporter.

And the netherlands have 2768 ktons exports / 4962 ktons imports (this makes it the second largest importer after germany).

1071,"&gt; They're not ideal, but they do show that the ""EU is just a protectionist racket"" is bullshit.

I did add some further details with an edit that shows the EU's unweighted tariffs are quite high compared to the US for example.

&gt; Note that even though agricultural tariffs are high, third world countries have tariff free quotas for lots of farm produce.

Doesn't matter, those nations will still sell their produce as if the tariffs were still in place so we still see the job losses in the EU due to higher retail prices.

&gt; Finally, although I'm a firm believer in free markets, I think that there are certain areas where governments should intervene. Making sure that enough food is produced to feed people is one of those areas.

I agree somewhat that strategic thinking is required when looking at tariffs, however one need not implement tariffs on a wide range of products to protect farms, one could provide farm subsidies for cash crops or even things like weed or meadows that allow our farms to remain active while the nation benefits from cheaper produce from abroad and we can keep strategic stashes of seeds if we were to ever run into a logistics problem.

In the UK at least we don't have enough farmland to produce enough food for our people anyway if i remember correctly.

1085,"&gt; Why a person from a war zone is supposed to be less capable of work? If anything, she/he should be more motivated and happy to contribute in a country that saved them.

I don't think you understand how human motivation works. 

First of all, most people are not ""happy to contribute"". If people work, they work to make a living and feed their family, not out of some sense of gratitude to a country. 

Second of all, someone who just escaped warzone isn't going to be ""happy"" or ""grateful"", they're going to be miserable that they lost their homes, property, possibly family, and are now surrounded by weird people talking in a weird language, many of which hate them by default.

1096,"&gt; A reasonable point, but we also provide 15% of the components by value. So by the same logic the US is reliant on us, albeit to a much, much lesser degree.

Come on, the US granting the UK some manufacturing jobs is not the US being reliant on you. The UK invested quite a lot of money in the F35 program, the way the US rewarded you has been insulting IMO. They gave you 0 access to their technology, only Israel had some access to the source code and was allowed to have modified versions of the F35. I wouldn't call that being a nice ally, and I recall some high-ranking UK military members being quite pissed about the whole thing and rightly so.

&gt; Not withstanding Trump, the US has been a better ally than most of Europe over the last century. It's not without its bumps (particularly Suez), but generally they've been in the right and take a tougher line on Russia than countries in the EU.

That's a fair point. But in the case of providing a service like an alternative to GPS I don't really see how it is relevant.

&gt; What do we actually pay for GPS then? This is worthless without numbers.

I can't find numbers unfortunately. Basically, you have two services offered by the GPS. There is the one you and I use to find something on GoogleMaps which is free. Then there is a high-precision one used by the military that enables you to track high-speed objects such as missiles. For the latter you have to pay a substantial fee to use it.

1158,"&gt; Italy has only lost by being into the EU; 

we are a nation based on manufacturing and our biggest markets are Germany and France. Being in the EU has enabled a lot of our companies to trade in the single market more than it would outside of it. My region alone, Emilia Romagna, has a lot of companies who are suppliers to several German companies. 

&gt; also not everything is about the economy.

Indeed. And I feel more safeguarded inside the EU than outside of it. I trust the EU commission more than my own government and the EU funding mechanisms are less prone to corruption than the Italian government attempts to industrialise the South or build infrastructures there. Not to mention that the EU has pushed us many times in the right direction. I come from a big-ish city in the Po Valley and we are constantly reminded that the EU is going to fine the city administration for exceeding the fine particles threshold and other pollution indicators. You know how much the central government would care about it without the EU? Zero. We see such an attitude in Taranto, for example, a city in the South with one of the biggest steel mills in Europe. The central government has ignored the fact that cancer incidence among the Tarantini and especially among the steel mill workers is abnormally high, as long as the still mill provides jobs. 

Of course the EU is not a bed of roses and many things must be changed in its mechanisms, from reforming the Dublin convention (which our populist government and Orban rejected BTW) to allowing for the Euro to be more flexible, give more power to the EP so that it can initiate bills, etc, but overall it brought us more good than bad. Our economic decline is mostly self made.

1206,"&gt;As is always the case, although there are obligations to be met on both sides.

Depends on a *lot* of terms.

It is very obvious that the UK and the EU will still cooperate closely in matters of domestic security, but the legal framework for extradition from an EU country towards a non-EU country is **far** more complicated and depends heavily on not only the UK's laws both in the present and the future, but also the interpretation of British law compared to EU fundamental law.

&gt;Without evidence detailing the latter its impossible to answer. Unless you are asserting that the UK NEVER extradites people.

Not saying that at all, just that the UK (as well as other countries) are kind of famous for just refusing a lot of extraditions with little to no grounds, and also interfering with foreign investigations, especially in some scandals in 2008.

&gt;Secondly 'the EU' doesnt get to extradite people in the first place, the country they are residing is does. Extradition isnt just an EU thing, its an international thing.

The EU upholds laws that are required to be fully applicable in any Member State's court, laws that **do** heavily affect international affects and though they facilitate juridical matters within the EU, they may complicate them for non-EU states.

&gt;Thirdly, the EU isnt quite a unified state, yet, and doesnt allow get to either allow or deny extraditions based on its personal advantage but on the local laws on the issue and whether or not the extradition appears valid. It cant say 'well sure the extradition is perfectly valid, but it wouldnt suit us, so no'. It has to go through various legal processes which the EU doesnt directly affect.

Again, the EU is well over 20 countries **but still all must follow EU law** which affect extradition quite a lot, hence why, for example, Sweden was brought to court after extraditing two men to Libya  on not fully studied grounds (which, according to the ECHR would be illegal).

The EU, as a whole, makes its laws that although aimed at primarily maintaining a Single Market and upholding basic European rights, also by consequence have heavy implications for non-EU states.

&gt;As I dont think that then I dont need to read up on it. You however, probably should if you think the EU gets to decide extraditions based on whether its and advantage to it or not.

Again, not my point; my point is that it is unclear how extradition to/from the UK will work in such a context due to the UK being *out* of the EU. I cannot really rub a crystal ball and tell you that the ECHR will remain in place, that the Court of Human Rights will still be recognized by the UK, I cannot even tell you what privacy laws or juridical laws the UK may pass nor on what juridical framework both the EU and the UK will cooperate.

Without knowing the outcome of Brexit in terms of institutions, in terms of juridical safeguards in the UK, *and* in terms of cooperation in juridical affairs between the UK and the EU... how am I supposed to assume that the UK can ""so simply"" get a Member State to extradite one of its citizens on the basis of a law that is not recognized by foreign courts?",LusoFrench citizen living in the Netherlands,/r/europe/comments/8oyymp/eu_outmanoeuvres_uk_in_latest_battle_over_galileo/e094gu6/,RafaRealness,1528348825

1235,"&gt; Spain’s new socialist prime minister has appointed 11 women and six men to his cabinet, saying his new government is “unmistakably committed to equality” and intends to reflect recent changes in Spanish society.
&gt; 
&gt; Announcing his choices at a press conference on Wednesday evening, Pedro Sánchez said his would be the first majority-female cabinet since Spain returned to democracy following the death of Gen Francisco Franco in 1975.
&gt; 

AND

&gt; Earlier on Wednesday, it emerged that the prime minister had chosen Pedro Duque, a 55-year-old **veteran of two space missions**, to serve as minister for science, innovation and universities in his new administration.
&gt; 
&gt; Duque, who **left Earth in 1998 and again in 2003**, responded to his appointment on Twitter, saying he wished his mother was still alive to see it. Beneath it, he posted a cartoon of a woman seeing her son off to work and telling him: “Remember, son, important jobs are the devil’s playground.”

The high-profile appointment is one of four new picks to join the Socialist cabinet of Pedro Sánchez, who became prime minister last week after leading a successful no-confidence motion against Mariano Rajoy of the Popular Party (PP).

&gt; Duque is one of the best-known faces in Spanish science. In October 1998 he participated in the Discovery mission, spending nine days in space to lead a series of scientific experiments for the European Space Agency. In October 2003 Duque returned to outer space aboard the Russian shuttle Soyuz, and spent 10 days at the International Space Station.

https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/aug/19/most-improbable-scientific-research-abrahams

&gt;Why do Bedouins wear black in the desert?
&gt;
&gt;The question so intrigued four scientists – all non-Bedouins – that they ran an experiment. Their study, called Why Do Bedouins Wear Black Robes in Hot Deserts?, was published in the journal Nature in 1980.
&gt;
&gt;""It seems likely,"" the scientists wrote, ""that the present inhabitants of the Sinai, the Bedouins, would have optimised their solutions for desert survival during their long tenure in this desert. Yet one may have doubts on first encountering Bedouins wearing black robes and herding black goats. We have therefore investigated whether black robes help the Bedouins to minimise solar heat loads in a hot desert.""
&gt;
&gt;The research team – C Richard Taylor and Virginia Finch of Harvard University and Amiram Shkolnik and Arieh Borut of Tel Aviv University – quickly discovered that, as you might suspect, a black robe does convey more heat inward than a white robe does. But they doubted that this was the whole story.
&gt;
&gt;Taylor, Finch, Shkolnik, and Borut measured the overall heat gain and loss suffered by a brave volunteer. They described the volunteer as ""a man standing facing the sun in the desert at midday while he wore: 1) a black Bedouin robe; 2) a similar robe that was white; 3) a tan army uniform; and 4) shorts (that is, he was semi‑nude)"".
&gt;
&gt;Each of the test sessions (black-robed, white-robed, uniformed and half-naked) lasted 30 minutes. They took place in the Negev desert at the bottom of the rift valley between the Dead Sea and the Gulf of Eilat. The volunteer stood in temperatures that ranged from a just-semi-sultry 35C (95F) to a character-building 46C (115F). Though he is now nameless, this was his day in the sun.
&gt;
&gt;The results were clear. As the report puts it: ""The amount of heat gained by a Bedouin exposed to the hot desert is the same whether he wears a black or a white robe. The additional heat absorbed by the black robe was lost before it reached the skin.""
&gt;
&gt;Bedouins' robes, the scientists noted, are worn loose. Inside, the cooling happens by convection – either through a bellows action, as the robes flow in the wind, or by a chimney sort of effect, as air rises between robe and skin. Thus it was conclusively demonstrated that, at least for Bedouin robes, black is as cool as any other colour.

**Here is the methodology. Its quite frankly shit.**  **Its like one of those totally misleading 'Happiness indexes.** Don't believe a word.

It includes everything from corruption to *perceived crime levels* **to motherfucking financial contributions to the UN peacekeeping forces!** HAHA

&gt; Military expenditure as a percentage of GDP

Seriously? That's why Norway does badly. We have some of the highest military spending per capita in Europe together with **Greece**!! 

Which makes sense historically since both of our countries are next to big imperialist countries such as Russia and Turkey. 

None of us have actually invaded anything for a long time though so I don't think military spending is a good variable here. 

Its a horrible thing basically. It doesn't measure how stable and peaceful your society is but rather a whole bunch of things that are vaguely related to it. 

Greece while having problems, have more peace than Nicaragua or fucking Peru. 

The first is one of the worlds most violent countries and a key country in the Latin American drug war while **Peru is the origin of much of the worlds cocaine and has actual ongoing insurgency with Communist militias who killed people as recently as 2017!!**

Additionally, Peru has a far higher murder rate than Greece and much less state control in parts of the country(the Amazon) where its at times a free for all between natives, guerrillas and corrupt companies. People are killing each other over resources there. 

That is the opposite of a peaceful country to me. 

Yet Greece is just above those two countries? Hahaha laughable indeed.

*googles*

This isn't the article I read, but it covers the point:

https://www.flexport.com/blog/airbus-a380-no-cargo-equivalent/

&gt;Air freight is measured in two ways: cube and weight. Cube refers to the volume of the freight. A plane is said to “cube out” when it’s fully filled up but doesn’t approach its weight capacity. The hypothetical freighter equivalent of the A380 would get too heavy as it approaches its volume limit.
&gt;
&gt;An A380-F would be too fat to fly at a profit: The plane would hit the maximum payload (a constraint of weight) before its maximum cubic space (a constraint of volume). Its design can’t support the maximum payload required to generate a profit.
&gt;
&gt;Consider a comparison with the Boeing 747-400F, a popular air freighter. The 747 has a maximum take-off weight of 448,000 kilograms to the A380’s 575,000. In addition, the 747 has a cargo capacity of 710 m3  to the hypothetical A380-F’s 1134 m3. The A380-F would be able to carry 60% more volume than the 747, but only 28% more weight. It wouldn’t be fully loaded at typical levels of air cargo density, or at least nothing close to what can be supported by the thrust capacity of the 747.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/8p3thh/a_decade_after_entering_service_the_first_a380s/e08zv4q/,vokegaf,1528343041

According to a ""senior IAEA official""

&gt;In 2005, Iran offered a deal.  We rejected it, refused to talk to Iran directly, and doubled down on sanctions.  Ten years later, we settled for much less than what was originally offered.  https://chasfreeman.net/lessons-from-americas-continuing-misadventures-in-the-middle-east/

IAEA head ElBaradei

&gt; I have seen the Iranians ready to accept putting a cap on their enrichment [program] in terms of tens of centrifuges, and then in terms of hundreds of centrifuges. But nobody even tried to engage them on these offers. Now Iran has 5,000 centrifuges. http://www.newsweek.com/elbaradei-iranians-are-not-fanatics-80021

BUT

&gt;They weren’t interested in a compromise with the government in Tehran, but regime change – by any means necessary http://news.antiwar.com/2011/04/20/elbaradei-us-europe-werent-interested-in-compromise-with-iran/

There was the usual bullshit and lies and faked ""evidence"" and nonsense claims
https://fair.org/home/aps-iran-bomb-drawing-hoax/


In fact, precisely because there was no evidence, the US actually did not accuse Iran of making nukes, but instead accused Iran of ""intending to obtain the capability"" to make nukes, even though the intelligence analysts emphasized that Iran had *not made the decision to make nukes*

https://thinkprogress.org/secretary-of-defense-iran-has-not-made-a-decision-to-pursue-a-nuclear-weapon-b968f8ef5256/

https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/25/world/middleeast/us-agencies-see-no-move-by-iran-to-build-a-bomb.html

The media and the proIsraeli hype-machinery didn't make the nuanced distinction and continued to scaremonger about Iranian nukes about to fall on Colorado in movies like ""Iranium"" https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tehranbureau/2011/01/iranium.html


In fact, the ""capability"" to make nukes was shared by 1 out of 4 nations on Earth 10 years ago and more since

http://old.seattletimes.com/html/nationworld/2002041473_nukes21.html
It is not only perfectly legal (The NPT requires the sharing of nuclear tech and Article V of the NonProliferation Treaty even requires the sharing of nuclear weapons test explosion data)  it is common and widespread because it is inherent in having even civilian nuclear technology

However this was a useful rhetorical ploy by the US because it shifted the burden of proof onto Iran, requiring Iran to *prove* that it might not one day in the indefinite future decide to make nukes -- something no amount of IAEA inspections couldn't disprove either, so the ""Iranian nuclear threat"" could always be maintained and used as a pretext for a policy of imposing regime-change in Iran just as the NeoCons and the Pro-Israeli lobby and now Saudi lobby wanted and have been pushing for a long long time now JUST as the pushed for the Iraq war, and brought to you by the same people too

[Barcelona tourism: Why you should still visit this great city](https://www.stuff.co.nz/travel/destinations/europe/98231345/barcelona-tourism-why-you-should-still-visit-this-great-city)

&gt;You have to ask yourself: is Barcelona the sort of place you still want to go to for a holiday? Is it actually a good idea?
&gt;
&gt;And the answer to those questions, is yes. Definitely. Despite the slim chance of your pocket being picked. Despite the ripples of anti-tourist sentiment. Despite the street marches and violent clashes and uncertain future. You absolutely do want to go to Barcelona.
&gt;
&gt;This is one of the greatest tourist destinations on the planet, despite any rumblings of discontent. This is home of La Sagrada Familia, one of the most impressive manmade structures you'll ever see

Well, hard to duplicate that, but there *are* other architectural achievements elsewhere in Europe.

&gt; as well FC Barcelona, one of the most impressive football teams you'll lay eyes on.

Not really my thing, but I guess for sports fans, that's fair.  Still, ""a good football team"" seems hardly bound to geography.

&gt; It's a city of food, glorious food, from the market stalls in El Born to the Adria brothers' empire of restaurants in Poble Sec; from the cosy tapas bars of the Gothic Quarter to the bistro-style eateries of Eixample.

Same thing — you can set up Spanish chefs anywhere.

&gt;Barcelona is the oddity of the mountaintop Tibidabo Amusement Park, and the fun of the Montjuic cable car.

If you can build an amusement park in one place, you can do it elsewhere.

&gt;It's the rough charm of the El Raval neighbourhood, and the beachy joy of La Barceloneta.

Beaches are a bit more of a constraint, but they *do* exist elsewhere.

&gt;It's the Gaudi buildings that you just stumble upon as you wander around;

That one might be hard.

&gt; it's the Michelin-starred restaurants that don't make a big deal of themselves to anyone.

Shouldn't be bound to geography.

As is always the case, although there are obligations to be met on both sides.

&gt;Why would the EU agree to extradite British citizens to its own disadvantage, when the UK has yet to extradite hundreds of French, Portuguese, Spanish, Belgian, Dutch, and even Swedish citizens?

Without evidence detailing the latter its impossible to answer. Unless you are asserting that the UK NEVER extradites people.

Secondly 'the EU' doesnt get to extradite people in the first place, the country they are residing is does. Extradition isnt just an EU thing, its an international thing.

Thirdly, the EU isnt quite a unified state, yet, and doesnt allow get to either allow or deny extraditions based on its personal advantage but on the local laws on the issue and whether or not the extradition appears valid. It cant say 'well sure the extradition is perfectly valid, but it wouldnt suit us, so no'. It has to go through various legal processes which the EU doesnt directly affect.

&gt;Also, if you think that extradition is a simple affair, you really should read up on how it works, especially for non-EU countries as the UK will soon be.

I'm positive I remember seeing an article on here about Stalin's double for this picture in particular but I can't find it. He definitely did have doubles for other projects at the very least so it's not far fetched.

~~If I find a better link I'll comment again~~

I take my comment back. This photo in particular is probably real  - I'm basing it off the fact that it's used in the [Stalin Museum ](http://www.stalinmuseum.ge/eng/gallery/stalin/) in Georgia. I'm assuming they wouldnt:

a) Be using fakes

b) Be able to fit in a fake with all the others

That being said, he had measles as a child that lead to scars on his body, especially his face. So later in life where it was more noticeable he did occasionally doctor photos. So this photo may have been doctored at least a little, or it was taken before his skin was messed up",Sweden,/r/europe/comments/8p0num/russian_state_tv_puts_a_smile_on_kim_jonguns_face/e08txjl/,Jaksuhn,1528337287

1542,"&gt; This is really a weird idea in view of the fact that these three entities would explicitly want and support change in Italy. 

Not at all, they limit the stuff any Italian government can do pretty heavily. They are only for changes in the very narrow sense that they want (and that aren't able to actually help Italy in the long run)

&gt;Where does this narrative come from and how did it arise?

Probably from the fact that Germany is heavily benefitting from the Eurozone yet engages in policies that actively damage it, and limit the stuff any government can do. 

For example, German policies keep German wages low, this hurts other European countries like Italy. At the same time, German investment is pretty low, not for the situation Germany is in, but for the Situation the Eurozone is in, which is a problem ofcourse since they are all interconnected now, you can't just make your policy dependant on how it directly affects only your country.

Add to that that Germany was against the Draghi stuff at the ECB, which is the only reason Italy hasn't defulated yet, and some of the really nasty stuff German media can write about southern europe, especially during the height of the Eurocrisis, and you very easily can get this narrative, quite legitimately so.

1582,"Preventing a society from diversifying immensely by closing its borders isn't quite the same as having an Apartheid system to deal with an already existing, extremely racially, materially and culturally diverse nation.

I don't really know why it is necessary to explain that. I guess people just like to be sensationalist here.

You Europeans are not in a situation yet that could bring forth a system like apartheid in your countries. Apartheid was a system that sought to manage an EXTREMELY DIVERSE society and preserve the various cultures, languages and races, and one where there was such a monumental chasm between one of the groups and the others in terms of historical wealth and development. It also had its origin in a time when the world was very different to how it is now. When apartheid was conceived, the world did not yet view resistance to mixing and amalgamation with different groups as evil.

You are correct, in a way. That quote was indeed the goal of Apartheid. It was believed that in a South Africa where everyone lived interspersed, that eventually all cultures and languages would die off, leaving everyone to assimilate into and accept the most dominant one, which was the English language and liberal English culture. That is happening now as we speak, in spite of all efforts to prevent it. All native languages are in decline, in spite of great efforts by previous governments to stimulate those languages by printing books, dubbing and commissioning TV shows and appointing those languages as the language of government and trade in certain designated areas. Of course the main area of concern of the apartheid regime was to protect and preserve and stimulate the growth of the Afrikaner culture and language and prevent it from suffocating in the shadow of the English juggernaut, but they nevertheless extended their efforts to the native black languages and cultures as well, translating and printing various textbooks and other materials in those languages and sponsoring TV and radio in those languages in their designated ""homelands"".

It was also believed that once different cultures and languages have vanished and everyone was essentially Englishmen in terms of language and culture, that interracial relationships would become ever more prevalent, resulting in the white minority essentially being absorbed into blackness and vanishing. With both Dutch/Afrikaans language and culture gone, combined with whites not being visually distinct, the Dutch Afrikaner would essentially be gone.

&amp;nbsp;

Whatever your personal sentiment is regarding such mergers and tremendous character changes, you cannot argue with the solid logic behind the reasoning of the pre\-1990 South African government. To them, the only solution to preventing amalgamation and loss of pre\-existing character, or the alternative, which would be different communities within the same borders with social tension and constant pressure and conflict between them, was to implement the Apartheid system and essentially split up South Africa into 11 different nations.

Regrettably, due to the black population not being considered as equals, Apartheid caused significant damage. If there had been a feasible way to have had all the different cultural and racial groups have their own nations while not being short of certain resources and proper education, then the ultimate outcome would have been superior to the situation South Africa is in now. 11 different, independent nations with their own governments would have been better than one super diverse one with immense social tension.

&amp;nbsp;

Isn't that the problem with most African nations that is constantly hammered upon? Diversity? How their arbitrary boundaries and grouping of many different ethnic groups and tribes within the same borders are underpinning their dysfunction? Apartheid, in a way, sought to avoid that, but ultimately ended much sooner than any milestones towards achieving the main objective could be achieved due to outside pressure.

&amp;nbsp;

In any case, Europe isn't really in the same situation, at least not at the moment. You have the option to AVOID putting yourselves in a situation where you have various different races and cultures within the same border and where you will lose your national, ethnic characters due to mass amalgamation with various foreign influences.

I am basically saying that you have to choose: Do you continue accepting many foreign people in your lands and then inevitably merge with them to obtain a new character; one where you have a different culture and your people essentially become an African mix, or do you you avoid that situation?

I can't say that one choice is morally superior to another, but you at least need to be aware of what is potentially in store for you.

Maybe this is a case of a South African not wanting Europeans to be naive and end up in a discordant social situation and constantly under pressure to amalgamate with different groups.",South Africa,/r/europe/comments/8oyp1r/on_berlins_arab_street_two_worlds_collide/e08l6ls/,Aksiram,1528328336

Until the last decade religious attire was banned in anything owned by the state.

Eventually the ban was lifted and the rest is history. You all know whats going on in Turkey.

It's not as if even some of the conquering cultures with a more xenophobic reputation were always as bad as the colonial powers of more recent centuries. 

For instance, Rome was willing to give Roman citizenship to most of the cultures they conquered within about one or two generations of the initial conquest (often in return for the men serving a given number of years in the Roman military, but that was generally also expected of Romans).

Rome also made a habit of mixing the people within the Empire, so in any given garrison there could be troops from just about every region of the Empire. Syrians or Egyptians in Britain or France were not all that rare. Generally, if Rome could get part of a defeated army to sign up for the Roman military as part of the peace agreement, those new recruits would be spread all over the Empire (with their families) to ensure that they wouldn't form areas where their culture was the primary one. The outcome of this is that within a few generations, their descendants might also be spread all over the Empire, and their identity will be more Roman than that of any other culture or region.

Romans were usually also rather tolerant of other faiths, albeit also ignorant of them. There were periods when Roman religion or Christianity would be enforced, but those were more of an exception than the rule.

The Romans also gleefully adopted ideas and technologies from other cultures, and then started calling them Roman after a bit of time had passed. They even got their Republic started with something like this, sending envoys to Greece to study the Greek city-state democracies and adapt their system. (These Romans probably went to Magna Graecia, or ""Great Greece"" - meaning Greek colonies in Sicily and South Italy - rather than the original Greece.)

Romans didn't care what colour someone was. If they had Roman citizenship, that was enough. To break through to the elite, you typically had to win glory and advance through the military, or be promoted by a patron (by befriending someone who was already in the circles of power, or marrying into such a family, for instance). People who had a Consul among their ancestors, or had enough wealth or land to be promoted to Senator in a Census, would be firmly in the in-group of the powerful elite, and at least in principle, if rarely in practice, someone from the frontier colonies, even a former slave, could rise all the way up there, or at least start their family on that path.",Finland,/r/europe/comments/8ohall/scandinavia_from_space_in_winter/e08leau/,bo-tvt,1528328564

1620,"&gt; it's not like it could have been much worse than the Cold War

What an awful comment. A Western alliance with Germany required Poland to be sold out to the Nazis. Hitler had an uncompromising stance on acquiring ""Living Space"" to the East which included Poland. Germany would have demanded Poland and committed genocide on the population there to free up land for settlers. This was a fundamental, core part of Nazi ideology and was practically the whole reason why WW2 kicked off in the first place. 

And then if the allies let Germany have Poland and commit a Holocaust on the people there, an invasion of the USSR would have brought even more land under German control which would have also come under genocide. The only way an anti-USSR alliance would have worked was if the Western allies allowed Germany to commit genocide to the east since the Nazis would not have tolerated anything else.

&gt; It's not like holocaust would have happened (or at least in the same extent) either if Germany hadn't been in such desperate situation.

This is a really troubling comment. The Holocaust was a direct response to the ""Jewish Question"" which the Nazis had fail to find an ""acceptable"" answer to by the 1940s. Nazi rule could have only led to the Holocaust since all other ""answers"" to the ""Jewish Question"" were deemed unfeasible or otherwise insufficient.

1626,"r&gt; But for operations at any proper scale, we are no more reliant than others are. Possibly France is better at logistics, but they're dependent on other abilities.

I'm not saying you are, but my point was that the UK is already heavily reliant on the US in strategic aspects. Like the nuclear deterrent that we discussed somewhere else in this thread. Of for your new fighters, now the flagship of the RAF for the next decades will be the F35. 

As for the other point, France is significantly less dependent of the US when it comes to military technology, which is a choice that comes at a price. And as I said several times in similar threads on this sub, France military does better than the UK in some aspects, and the UK does better than France in others. That's why our countries signed the Lancaster House Treaty to be able to complement each others without the US.

&gt; I'm perfectly aware of that, but I personally trust the USA more than I trust Germany and Italy, where much of Galileo was to be controlled from. If it was free it would be great, but paying billions to get a system that is still reliant on other countries seems like a mistake to me, unless the commercial aspects could were enough to turn a profit. But of course the profit would go to the EU and not the countries that stumped up the cash...

I really don't understand you there. First, I'd like to know for what reasons do you trust more the US and its GPS than the EU for Galileo?

Second of all, the service is never free, you'd pay billions to the US.

For example, you and your relatives(and all of Russia apparently) would rather believe the US was behind it all than to accept that a majority of Ukrainians wanted to choose Europe and got pissed when their president refused to do that, and then responded to protests with murder. 

Ultimately, no matter how much you wanna believe big bad US was behind it all, nothing would have happened if Yanukovych would've actually listened to the protesters and didn't start murdering them.

 The only real conspiracy here is why Yanukovych chose the path he did, and I'm pretty sure Russia has a big part in it. 

Ultimately, that's what it all boiled down to. A majority of Ukrainians wanted to follow the European path, Russia did NOT want that, at all.

The Speaker of the House is a non-partisan position.  Bercow resigned his membership of the Tory party on being elected to the post under a Labour government and by a Labour controlled House of Commons.  If you have any evidence that the independent commission was politically influenced, and in particular influenced by Bercow, breaching his independent status specifically to satisfy an ally of the present government, I would be more than willing to consider it. That would be a huge constitutional scandal and would merit his removal.

&gt;If the Irish Goverment has anything to say on the matter it would not be in public, it would be done in private instead of using megaphone diplomacy, otherwise the DUP would accuse them of interfering in the internal governance of the UK.

If the Irish government really believed that the GFA had been breached by a corrupt and partisan attempt to gerrymander the boundaries in Northern Ireland to disenfranchise nationalists, I'm pretty sure they would be vocal about it.  And I very much hope they wouldn't care less what the DUP had to say about them speaking out.  

As I said before, if this is about more than political point scoring, then Sinn Fein should definitely be applying for judicial review of the decision.

&gt;After condemning the annexation of Crimea, why do you fail to condemn the bloody coup?

I condemn all violence. And there certainly was no need for Yanukovych sending his thugs to escalate, kidnap, beat up. And there was no reason for police and Berkut trying to violently end the protest.

&gt;See here. There were violent paramilitaries.

And again, the incidents you cite should invalidate the other protesters how exactly? Your link just confirms what I said, it was a minor faction in the protest. The link also makes no mention about violent actions from the government, and in which chronological relation they had happened.

Right, so you believe these conflicts only happened because evil western euro's right?

That there was no uprising in Syria that triggered a civil war? Nah, it was all Belgium going in guns blazing and bombing Damascus causing the country to collapse. Same for Libya. And for general migration from Africa to Europe. All of these were completly 120% the fault of Belgium and its pals.

You know Libyans and Syrians are only a small percentage of the migrants right? That most people are completely unrelated and would have come anyway? And no, Gadaffi wouldn't have stopped them, much like Erdogan doesn't until we start handing over them euro's.

That isn’t true, then many economists were broadly supportive of it or had a neutral view of it. There are advantages and disadvantages to it and that would be seen until later.

Finland's high level of militarization ensured that Finland, while partially subservient, wasn't fucked over by the Soviets as Poland was for example. If they weren't as militarized they would've been invaded.

Its planned closure date is currently 2033 but there's technically nothing stopping them from operating longer than that.

With electricity prices around that number its struggeling to make a profit. Prices however are rising again and if the Dutch government decides to close some coal plants it could make a profit again.

Any decision ECB will make is highly political at the moment, and I don't think the people in charge have any idea how to get out of this political dilemma. 

Draghi's comment that ECB will do whatever it takes calmed down markets before. The problem is that when you press that to the limit, everyone knows they will not really do whatever it takes. There is always a limit, and that limit need to be explained to everyone involved. There also has to be a mechanism to prevent countries from overstepping that limit and deal with those that too. For instance Greece wasn't allowed to participate in QE, that was a limit, but it is also a very ambiguous limit.

2062,"I'm with you on basically everything you just wrote.

Still I see potential to screw that position up.

Right now we have divisions opening up within the EU, basically along the line where the iron curtain used to sit. Up until roughly 10 to 15 years ago EU expansion was still fueled by the euphoria after the cold war ended. Eastern Europe (or what is now the eastern members of the EU) joined the EU probably mainly because of economic reasons. Then came around the economic hard times, the Euro crisis, Greece and a lot of that euphoria faints. And now for the last few years the refugee numbers have surged and we are facing a divide that was not known in EU. Merkel actually made a decision that could be described as christian (the one and only christian decision she has ever made in all her terms as chancellor, if you ask me) and suddenly she faces the wrath of a lot of christian-conservatives, especially to the east.

The eastern EU members don't feel obliged to aid Merkels decision, on the contrary they feel coerced and faced with a fait accompli. They see a chance for leverage and they take it. I mean, who wouldn't?

I assume this will be the biggest challenge for Europe as I see no signs of the conservative movement losing traction.

The threat of the cold war did keep things running. Yeah, we were probably not as free in our decisions as we are now, but we were more agile. More able and willing to face adversity and to overcome it even though we have a politically diverse society. The issue is not that we have conservatives, the issue is that politics has ground to a stand-still and we are only reacting, slowly, instead of anticipating things and acting before.

In my opinion Europe would have needed to find its balls on a global stage by the end of the 90s. If it did, things might have played out different after 9/11. We live in a way more unstable world today than in 2002. Europe has the tools to be a diplomatic powerhouse, we have seen that time and time again. When al-qaida swept through the US, Spain, the UK and Paris I often said I don't expect us Germans to become targets soon. We are the one EU country always delaying action, always pressing for a diplomatic solution to things. And there are situations where this is the correct way to go. But we need to be willing to diplomatically strong-arm others some times. And to be able to do so we need to be willing to take action if talking doesn't work. We Germans haven't done that. Yeah, we're in Kosovo and in Afghanistan and in Mali and with ships around Somalia but not from our own drive. We take part if someone we trust enough takes action (US sometimes, France, the EU, the UN) but we do not take action and lead ourselves. We even axed our president when he said we need to be willing to apply force to protect our economical interests.

So, rant over, yeah, we are in a great position but the pendulum swings towards isolation and we need to make sure it does not swing too far. And we need to grow a pair. We Germans first because the EU can't grow a pair as long as we don't take part. Macron is on the right way in some parts, we need to steer him towards a working consensus. And I think that Merkel could be the right person to do so if she has enough pressure from within. Alas, I don't see it, as pressure is there but on the wrong issues.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/8ox9vv/74_years_ago_on_this_day_the_battle_of_normandy/e07g7c8/,Nemo_Barbarossa,1528291487

2128,"What is your suggestion? We clearly dont have enough land to create enough wind parks on what we currently need. Hydro power is out of the question. What do you suggest? Let me tell you what i (and people in our sector) have been suggesting for **decades**.

The EU was made to remove borders. Yet with these kind of regulations we rank countries? What kind of bullshit is that? It makes zero sense to build windparks in the Netherlands when the soil there is **way too expensive** for any company to buy the soil and make a profit, even with government funding. Why not use Dutch government subsidies, that were gonna be spend anyways, and build them in other EU countries, which in turn supply a European wide energy net? No, because we have to be ranked on what we produce within our borders. Cause we are a EU without borders, but really with very clear defined borders?

Also building a modern coal plant isnt a bad idea at all. I know the random citizen doesnt understand this; but it really is. Its very clear that within the next 30-40 years we will still need coal plants in Europe. No qeustion about it; we simply do. Even if its only to be turned on to do the lifting during a few peak periods over a decade time; you still need it. Atleast untill we can implement super batteries that can reliably store immense amounts of power. 

When you know for a fact that the EU will still have coal plants in 40 years, what do you think is best? Keep the ones from the 1950s era Polish coal plants running, or a hyper modern one in the Netherlands from the last decade? I swear to god even the GroenLinks politicians have no clue what they talk about when they dare to compare our modern coal plant to a soviet era one from the eastern block. Spoiler: there s a massive difference.

So again, why look at borders? Why close the new Dutch one, while we can close a much more polluting one in Poland and keep the Dutch one lasting for a few decades more, untill we really dont need any coal anymore in like half a century, en then close the Dutch one too.

No, cant be done, because we have to achieve our national set targets. So we close the modern Dutch plant while the Polish ones stays open. A net loss for the entire EU, a net los for the climate in general, but a net win for the Dutch GreenLeft.

2153,"I think that having more control and making more money are two very different goals, perhaps even mutually exclusive. The best way to make money in the digital environment is to make easy\-to\-use offers for a fair price. Why is there no Spotify for films, where I can watch any movie as soon as it comes out, for a fair price? Sure, there is Netflix, Amazon Prime, Sky etc., but they all offer different stuff, there is no one\-stop shop where I can pay for and watch the stuff that I really like. I also think it's a mistake that filmmakers still insist on keeping films off digital channels while they are playing in movie theatres. I actually go to the movies quite a lot, but not everybody is able to do that, for example because they have small children or live in a country where films are not shown in their preferred language. For those people, there is no legal route to watch and pay for the entertainment they want. The industry needs to fix this if it wants to build a sustainable digital business model.

In the music sector, streaming is already working reasonably well. I do agree with the music industry that YouTube's ContentID is unfair and has created problems. Instead of allowing music authors and performers to negotiate collectively through trade organisations and collecting societies, every author is given a take\-it\-or\-leave\-it deal, which most people end up taking. At the same time, legitimate indy creators regularly see their own [original creations wrongfully removed by ContentID](https://juliareda.eu/2017/09/when-filters-fail/). So no, the status quo on YouTube is not fair to creators. However, if ContentID has created a problem, how can it be a sensible solution to make ContentID mandatory on even more platforms, including websites that have no significant copyright infringement problem at all? If anything, we should be talking about banning ContentID, and perhaps replacing it with a system where the uploads of music by individual users are legalised and in return music authors get paid a compensation.

You see; you seem to not understand how densely populated the Netherlands actually is. Everything that isnt within city or town limits, and therefor illegal to construct wind farms to begin with, is either owned by private parties or is protected reserves. We cant lose even more protected reserves as the nature we have is already barely anything noteworthy. What remains is the farm land / private owned property. For the EU natura 2000 we already have to designate most farm land that becomes ''free'' (farmer stops farming), to give back to natura 2000 and be designated as nature reserve if applicable (so when there s other nature reserves around, which suprise; is nearly the entire eastern netherlands, which is the only part of the netherlands besides the north that isnt completely build full). 

So what remains are the Waddenzee (international protected nature reserve, cant built wind farms there), the coastline (which is basically the entire randstad; a region where over 10.000.000 people live, and the dunes themselves are often the only protected nature reserve left in the Holland provinces).

We can still build some more windmills, altho no big wind parks like other countries. Problem with that is, funnily enough, often EU laws. 

Im all in favor of building more artificial islands tho. Like we are now planning to do with your country and Denmark/Germany. 

Nearly no other country on earth is as densely populated as the netherlands except for city states. How can people expect massive windfarms to supply 20.000.000 with electricity, since sun hours are limited and hydro not a option?

Same goes for Nice and Alsace, they historically bounced between Italy/Germany and us so I can understand, even tho they would be part of Gremany or Italy not independant, and even tho nobody back there wanna be independant.

Normandy and Jura are a 100% French, but they do have a ""regionnal culture"", so I'm gonna accept that aswell even if it's a nonsense.

2268,"Depends on where you currently live, but if you come from a more southern location it could be good to prepare a bit for life in darkness. Seasonal depression is very common here during winter, and if you are not mentally and emotionally prepared it might come as a shock. Make sure to start eating vitamin D supplements during fall and keep eating them all trough winter, it will lessen the risk for biochemically induced depression. 
Right now it's only really dark for a couple of hours around midnight but in December you only get a few hours of proper daylight, it will be dark when you go to work and dark when you go home from work. But the darkness can be very cozy as well so try to make the best of it! And after a Nordic winter you will understand why we all worship the sun the way we do, I think the contrast between seasons makes me appreciate all of them more. Except December, I find it very difficult to appreciate that particular month. 

Recycling is an important part of our culture, make sure to properly sort paper, cardboard, plastic, glass, and metal in the correct bins at your local recycling facility. If you are going to live in an apartment you will most likely have such a facility right outside your building. 

My own impression is that swedes generally are quite happy to help, so don't be afraid to ask strangers on the street. Most people speak good English, but age is usually a good predictor for how well you might understand their accent. 

Take advantage of our right to roam and explore nature, pick berries and mushrooms but make sure to know very well which mushrooms you pick since a lot of them would kill you. And absolutely no littering in nature, we take that shit serious here. 

Public transport is fairly good, so if you live in a larger city you probably won't need a car if you don't absolutely want to. It's somewhat expensive though, but so is petrol. 

Our medical care is cheap and good, especially specialty care, but since it's being rapidly and extensively defunded it can be a lot of hassle to actually get the care you need. Our general care facilities (vårdcentraler) vary greatly in quality and funding depending on the socioeconomic status of the neighborhood. In order to get emergency treatment for minor afflictions, such as the flu and similar, you usually need to call the facility early in the morning to book an appointment the same day. You pay a flat fee of 150-300kr per visit until you reach the maximum of 1100kr per 12 month period, whereafter you won't need to pay anything at all. Similar system for prescription medications. 

Racism is on the rise big times right now, so don't be too surprised when you see a lot of hate towards refugees and immigrants.

2288,"A venue of energy is considered renewable if the stores of raw material from which the energy is extracted is significantly replenished or insignificantly diminished on a human timescale. Otherwise, you could argue that the heat death of the universe precludes the concept of renewable energy altogether.

I do concede that the word is ill-chosen. I would prefer the term *sustainable* instead of renewable, with the latter being an aspect of the former. Let's substitute this word and carry on.

Solar energy is definitely sustainable. The sun won't go out in any foreseeable future on a human timescale. There are several sustainable methods of solar energy extraction. They range from collecting, transporting and storing the energy as heat, to making structures where the sun heats air to make a draft which drives wind turbines. These have their own issues, but are good for what they are. I'm guessing you are referring to solid-state photovoltaic solar power. Your concerns there are valid: 

* Certain types of PV cells use cadmium, a heavy metal.
* The manufacturing has more or less moved to China, where environmental concerns are more or less dick.
* *Shipping* raw materials and finished products all over the world isn't very ecologically sound, either.

As I said, these are all perfectly valid concerns. But:

* The cadmium is extracted from mining sludge, a dirty byproduct which would have sprung into existence anyway. Locking the cadmium into PV panels for harvesting solar energy is probably the *least* offensive use for that slurry.
* The manufacturing of pretty much everything has moved to China. This is not a solar problem specifically.
* Shipping infrastructure is already in place. If we can make sustainable energy more popular and power our shipping methods with it, the ecological footprint will go down.

I don't really mind nuclear power, given a political vacuum and a supply of already-purified material. It's brilliant! Move the absorby thing away from the shiny thing to make it warm, boil some water on it, feed into steam engine, bam! What's there to dislike?

Well, everything else, actually. Where does it all come from? Where does it all go? Mining for fissile materials is *ridiculously* intensive, and the mining operation itself is hardly driven by sustainable energy today. There are loads of byproducts left from the mining. And when you've mined, extracted, purified and used the material … you still have hazardous leftovers which are really hard to dispose of. Impossible, in fact; you need to seal it all away for absolute ages. *Welp,* turns out some people are very much in the market for such hazardous materials, and would do anything to get their hands on some …

Nuclear isn't damnation. Nor is it salvation. It has its pros and its cons just like the rest of them. Unlike the rest of them, however, the pros *and* the cons are pretty damned major, and as long as the world looks the way it does I'd rather take my chances on the lower-risk, lower-reward alternatives.

2307,"An enduring Nordic union would have been pretty cool but it's not so strange that Sweden wasn't happy to be ruled from Denmark. It's not obvious that the capital of Scandinavia should have been Copenhagen and Swedish nobility had previously tried to instate a [Swedish monarch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_VIII_of_Sweden) of the Kalmar union without success.

Plus let's not forget that the reason for Gustav's rebellion was that Christian II straight up [murdered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_Bloodbath) a large portion of Swedens nobility including his parents. So Christian II shares a pretty big part of the blame for the Kalmar union failing.

The fact is that the Kalmar union was always on shaky ground because of the rivalry between Sweden and Denmark and it's hard to see it lasting much longer than it did. Indeed you could make [the argument](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5zav5w/how_powerful_was_the_kalmar_union_compared_to/) that it was more like a 100 year long civil war then a healthy political union.

&gt;The Union lasted 126 years. The Danish King was in control of Sweden for a grand total of 56 years. Of them, 37 years was in the beginning under Margareta and Erik. The Danes needed to negotiate and fight all the time to keep Sweden and in some cases Norway too, under control.

[As a side note Swedens population was slightly lower then Denmarks at this time but considerably higher if you include Finland.

2309,"Comparing Kosovo and Crimea wont work for reasons we both know.

For one Kosovo had autonomy up until the 1990s where that Autonomy was taken away. Alongside Autonomy, state jobs were also taken away only to ethnic albanians which sparked massive protests and movements within the state .  

Two, this is important, the Panda Case. The entire premise of the war was the panda case, that just like Mr. Putins little green men were discovered years later to be serbian secret agents, so the entire premise of the war was a dud. 

Thirdly, Serbian troops during the 1990s war targeted, plundered and burned historical sites to remove any sign of albanian nativenes in those lands and pushed for : ""Albanians never lived here we took them in from Albania.""
  Mosques, historic villages, Monasteries anything that spelled albanian was targeted and in their place churches were built, yes those churches that were later attacked.

And as for the genocide deniers, over 500.000 people were displaced,13.k killed, 5000 women systematically raped in ""brothels"", entire villages reduced to ashes. And to hide proof there were massive graves, from the trucks found in the river, to the mass grave found under a parking lot to the bones used in cement to build roads.

Everything happened at the Leśny estate. A small child called to 112 emergency number. She said that a close person needs help, gave the address and disconnected. Dispatcher to the block at ul. Cisowa sent a team of an ambulance and police. During this time, you tried to contact the child, but did not answer the phone.

Doctor Robert Górski knocked on the door of the flat on the first floor. Nobody opened and did not speak. It turned out that this flat was rented. Neighbors said there was no trouble with the tenants. They also knew nothing about the possible health problems of people living in the apartment. Valuable time was running out.

He would not fit. Before the firefighters ran up with the portable ladder, too much valuable time would have passed.

The doctor, waiting for the firefighters, ran to the back of the block. There he noticed the open balcony door to the apartment where the help had been called. He immediately went up the balcony and grated the top and got to the apartment. - Inside, I saw an unconscious man lying on the couch - says R. Górski. The man was already blue with hypoxia. There was no contact with him.

After opening from the inside, the door to the apartment came with medics with life saving equipment. After a while the rescuers saw a 4-year-old. - The child was scared, she hid in the room, because she was afraid to open the door. We took care of the girl and handed over to the firemen - says R.

It can. Because unlike Crimea, Kosovo had an actual election. Just as a reminder to you how an election must be:

The crimean ""referendum"" was brought forward two times and eventually was held just 3 weeks after occupation. **This is an unfair advantage for a party that was prepared in advance.**
* **Secret vote**: Key to such a headed discussion is a secret and fair vote. The Crimean ballot had **translucent ballot boxes**, **no envelopes** and **no folded ballots**. It was thus always possible to identify the voter and his vote.
* **Enough options**: A fair referendum about independence should offer at least three choices: **Inpedence, Status quo, join the third party state**. The crimean ""referendum"" **only had two options**: a weird, confusing statement about independence, and to join russia.
* **International, unbiased election observers**: Well, this one speaks for itself.

So why doesn't this apply to the Putin argument of 'that's just how politicians are' then?

&gt; That we have problems we obviously need to work on doesnt stop us from praising our qualities.

There are no qualities; it's utterly dismal and ridiculous in all places because it could have _easily_ been fixed a long time ago if people weren't so fucked up in their worship of status and national tradition.

Bernard would've been tried if only the people had demanded it but they didn't because he was popular enough and the man who took bribes was offered many important positions after that and it was revealed that he had even _ordered_ an illegal tapping on a political enemy after that. Even if the tapping was legal as prince-consort he has no authority to order such things but it happened anyway because those people know he has so many friends in high places that if they refuse him they will notice that suddenly they will face all sorts of problems with their career.

You said that there's enough resources to go around and that you're not competing against eachother. 

That statement is reflective of the Scandinavian cultural attitude, which is very cooperative compared to the rest of the world.

The US actually has a higher GDP per capita than Denmark, so it's safe to say that theoretically, the US also has enough resources to go around. American society, however, strongly promotes competitive attitudes and being better and wealthier than others and I recall many Romanian users lamenting their culture of fucking others over for their own gain in another thread on /r/europe. 

What I mean to say is that if you placed people from other cultures in the same position, with the same kind of social security net that Denmark has, they would still not behave in the same way as Danish people because their culture is more competitive.

2575,"Well, there are multiple mistakes there; that can be avoided. I play only Ironman, so I don't have the luxury of reloading.

If you think that succession is shakey, Take seduction focus and start seducing all the ladies in your court and start churning out bastards. You can acknowledge then, but not legitimize them, and legitimize them later if your legitimate heirs are in a tough spot. (Ie, too young, idiot, or dead.) IMO, having only a 1 year old kid as a 40 year old ruler is pretty inexcusable, and can be only excused if you only started the game, in which case, cmon, it's like...10 minutes of gameplay, no need to get that salty.

Secondly, 12k personal troops as an Emperor? That is woefully, abysmally, criminally low. As an Emperor, you should have approx 9-10 counties in your demesne, and by year 800-900, each should have at least 2k troops to raise. Moreover, counties in the duchy in which your capital is get a 25% levy bonus, so usually you want your capital to be in a duchy with 5+ counties (and a county with 7 holding spots, and ideally a silk road trade post though that can be developed with county focus.) Moreover moreover, your capital county gets a 50% levy bonus, and that can be further boosted by the Marshal job to raise troops in the capital. Even further, the bonus is applied to all holdings you personally hold in the capital county, so if you hold 1 extra castle in it, that is a lot of troops.

Thirdly, where's the retinue? Retinue is not affected by martial score, and they are extremely OP, and as an Emperor, you should have access to a rather large retinue, that can mop up with pretty much everything, especially the generic Defense one (or Italian pikes or Scottish schiltrons.) Seen retinues win 1:2 battles with a crushing victory against opponent levies, if you play them smartly on the defense in rough terrain.

You can also raise Mercs if you have more gold than sense, and keep them as a semi-perma retinue until your heir grows of age. Merc numbers are taken into account when the AI decides whether to attack or not.

As a 1 year old kid, things are going to be horrifyingly slow and you have little control over your vassals, but there are a couple things you CAN do. Make sure your spymaster is loyal. If necessary, fire your current one, and hire a lower skilled on that is loyal. Your mother makes an excellent spymaster due to the 50 opinion bonus that she gets as a mother. During the previous king's rule, make sure that the regent you nominate has good, virtuous traits, and possibly content. Set theSpymaster to scheme, and you will get events that try to 'convince' your vassals to not join factions.

As a kid with acces to large emperor-ish coffers, you can ~~bribe~~ send gifts to vassals who are in factions against you that feel lukewarm towards you. (After 50 opinion, vassals might start to leave factions on their own, and after 80, they automatically leave.) This will leave only the ones that truly hate you in factions (don't give them gifts, they will hate you slightly less, but now they have money to do stuff with it.)

Turn off 'automatic plot cancelling', and if any of them start a plot that gives you lawful imprisonment reason, do it. You might have to fight a small war but you should win, and everyone in your realm will get at the very least a 10 opinion bonus for winning a civil war, and you end up with a rival in prison. Imprisoned vassals cannot factionalize or start plots. (Don't set them free, put them in house arrest so they don't die.)

CAREFUL: Unlwful revoking or inprisonment is horrible whenyour vassals are disgruntled. You get tyrrany opinion malus, and the civil war will be not so little because all factions will declare war on you if you anger a faction member, if you're being unlawful.

So, there you have it. A few things to do to mitigate the very common complaint of: ""Ruler died young and now I'm driving a 1 year old"".",,/r/europe/comments/8oqhm2/map_of_europe_if_every_separatist_movement/e06w781/,Iazo,1528258502

Not really because the English didn't speak German or Dutch. They kept referring to the 'Dutch' people that they had been trading and warring against with the same name that they had always used.

There were consultations with the Romanians. The demand of the majority of them was equal rights, by legal acknowledgement in the contemporary medieval legal system.

The Hungarians argued by joining Hungary the medieval legal system would be immediately replaced with a civil one. Everyone would have granted civil rights that put people in way more equal position. So did it happen, without bothering with the medieval system to first symbolically acknowledge Romanians and only then abolish the whole system.

Regardless even in 1849 Lajos Kossuth and Nicolae Bălcescu negotiated, though it did not have any result, because meanwhile the revolution took an unsuccessful turn.


&gt; It was an austrian - hungarian deal that ignored the protests of the majority.

I hope you also do not forget that on the other hand, Romanians in fact did not consult with anyone in Transylvania in 1918. They ignored not only the protest of Hungarians, Szekelys who made up the majority in their well separable regions, but also ignored the will of Transylvanian Romanians as in the vote over the unio delegates of Old Romania (among whom some were not any kind of representatives) outnumbered delegates of Transylvanian Romanians.

In my mind, smaller countries would promote more personal responsibility, it's easy to blame the bureaucrats in Madrid or London for your ills (some probably legitimate, some not) when you come from Scotland or Catalonia. It's more difficult to blame your own ilk. (Although yes, some will still do). You also feel that your voice and vote holds more weight if it's one in a million instead of one in a hundred million.

Smaller countries would also leave more room for experiment and innovation, doing large scale reforms in a large country is expensive and slow, smaller countries have an easier time for trying things out. There are a lot of good ideas, that nobody dares to try, but might lead to giant success, if you see it working somewhere else, you might adopt it for yourself.

It would also lead to more competition, of trying to outdo your neighbors.

The already small countries have a difficult time in the EU for example of pushing through economic policies, they get steamrolled by the huge countries, this would enable countries to better form ""blocks"" on issues and would make for a more fair playing ground.

If Germany had to pay fairly for for its own share of NATO - including US Navy protection for the worldwide shipment of its vaunted exports - it would have to make cuts in its welfare state.

I can only guess that you as a fellow CEE person (I'm Polish btw) know how many of those our region produced in last century. And we know what drives people to such desperate moves. If real Geneve convention rules were applied, I don't think many peope would object. It states very clearly who refugees are and on what conditions we are obliged to help them as signatories of this treaty and genuine good hearted people. The problem is when the distinction between refugee and economical migrant is blured. You are a refugee if you have resonable claim of fear for persecution or death due to your circumstances in your home country. Shit economy, corruption and unreliable government or stupid policies is not a reason for asylum. Yet,if the person granted refugee status goes on holidays to the very same country they run away from than we have the problem and this clearly shows that the boundaries seemed to blure along the way. (I've only read meadia reports about stuff like that in Switzerland in Germany, I'll look for sources if I have to) I think this is why our region of EU generally rejected refugee quota because we don't believe that what the Western Europe do/used to do is right. 

You wrote ""If they are not physically here, they cannot apply for asylum."" is pretty much what Hungary does with 2 persons a day quota for asylum seekers entering Hungary via their fenced boarder.

I don't know what you think is happening, but it takes a lot to get therapy from the government, I am pretty sure the thing done in most places right now is stopping puberty allowing the person to make the choice of transitioning when they are older and had years to decide, all while getting psychological help, if they still want to do it as adults it's a great help if they could stop their puberty, if not they can simply stop blocking it.

Honestly, this is all studied for decades and people actually care, doctors want to help people they really do, and this is what they believe helps them, there is nothing much to be added here.

And as far as foreign policy goes - you are mistaken. Not so long ago Lithuanian and USA positions on Russia differed radically. Our diplomats were treated as idiots for insisting Russia is up to no good, while USA wanted us to take more gentle approach. Of course, Georgian, Ukrainian and other events proved us right so USA has fallen in line ;)

Secundo, ""knowing"" someone is miles away from actually commiting an act of terror. Sentsov is sentenced because of an alleged terror act he commited, and no evidences were presented. The chain of thought you build would not stand in any court except for the soviet/russian circus.

Tertio, I think you conciously switch topic from Sentsov's illegal imprisonment to an orthogonal case of Afanasiev. I will reiterate here:

* Oleh Sentsov was arrested over a fabricated case.
* He is deprived of Ukrainian citizenship
* His human rights were violated
* He was tortured and beaten
* He is sentenced based on falsified claims and non existing evidences
* One of two witnesses was tortured, other is in mental facility.

By contrast, America has celebrated enterprise and has maintained a strong tradition of Business Tycoon-ism something not very commonly seen elsewhere in Europe or Asia. As a result, the natural conclusion of any declining Republic is a culimnation towards Oligarchism due to the wealth amassed by large numbers of elites across America. The American 1% currently hold wealth which would equate to levels of wealth normally held by landed gentry or by priests or top bureaucrats in Europe and Asia. The difference being that those priests or bureaucrats or gentry will hold some form of blood, theocratic or nationalist loyalty to their nation. A businessman has one loyalty: his bank account.

Screw you, all these countries enjoy similar social safety net. Whether they're on Scandinavian peninsula or not. And most of them don't have any oil, so your point that Poland can't do the same because it doesn't have oil is moot.

&gt;government covers the deficit, which is not disclosed. As far as I know the Polish system, government is not meant to cover anything,

Well aren't we discussing the possibility of transition to nordic model? This would include moving into state financed pension and ending the illusion of personal ZUS accounts.

&gt;the savings won't be significant. And yet, it could mean a lot

Sure. That's why we need to combat corruption. No argument there. This doesn't prevent us from implementing nordic-style social security.

&gt;low corruption states have better welfare systems
Sure, people with good welfare don't need to steal as much. It's a proof that good welfare reduces corruption! We should implement basic income ASAP!
This is sarcasm, btw. Correlation isn't causation.
Also still waiting for any proof that corruption in Poland is higher than in Italy, for example.

&gt; I was all like you, no, there's no corruption.

I'm not saying that. I'm saying that corruption is pretty low and not unlike that in other big European countries. Biggest scandals are what, ministerial awards, a bit of nepotism here and there, and cash for church (as usual for far-right). I mean, the Germans have had their chancellor bought by Putin (Gerhard Schroeder). Now THAT is corruption. What we have isn't out of the norm.
It's not possible to run a country without some corruption. People will always cheat. Of course we need to combat it and punish it but as long as it doesn't hinder state's effectiveness it's a crime for police to deal with. Not for politicians to bend their policies around it.

&gt; why are pensions so low, still below minimum sustenance?

Because we still keeping to the Ponzi-scheme of ZUS. To solve this:
1. Annex ZUS as a governmental agency
2. Finance it directly from budget
3. Include current ZUS-costs in PIT and CIT
4. Catch the tax evaders - especially VAT extortionists (PiS has done some steps in this directions)

It's not like we have no money, it's just the money is in the wrong pocket.

&gt; Even if we pay a lot of taxes

Not true, we pay very little taxes. https://cdn-attachments.timesofmalta.com/c1dd8c9c71bf5cb08d44a507c481e341997207508-1392557096-5300bc28-620x348.jpg

&gt; o tax break for amounts below minimum sustenance

We should have such tax breaks. The problem with Polish tax system is that it relies too much on individual payers and is too lenient on big business. To change that, Poles must elect leftist parties.

&gt; Because the tax money is misappropriated

Oh my god, there you go again. One paragraph above this, you seemed to understand how pension system works in Poland. Tax money isn't going into ZUS coffers unless it's in danger. Low pensions have nothing to do with tax money being misappropriated.

&gt;nefficient benefits count here.

&gt; cutting some benefits here, giving some there, and basically making a general overhaul of the system.


Why? Citation needed. Polish social system efficiency is well regarded in the world. We basically do a lot with almost nothing. What do you think is broken? Specifically.

&gt; a populist party won't pursue it.

Yet, shitting on civil service, ""urzędasy"", ""zusy-krusy"" and the like is #1 rant of every populist in Poland. Everybody hates the clerk.

the Netherlands is cutting out fracking, and moving to more electricity for homes, so less disposable income for millions of families, thats gonna hurt the local economy and the EU as a whole,

3196,"&gt;it makes no sense at being a taboo.

I think it makes sense. And I wrote why.

&gt;In that case, gatekeep Auschwitz only for central Europeans.

How did you deduce it from the sentence: *this tradition or pattern of behavior is not held in central Europe.*?

&gt;You can't judge why a person went there or not

I can guess and I can assume.

&gt;Even if you could, no-one appointed you at being a judge

No one appointed you being a judge as well so why do you condemn author's behavior and attitude?

&gt;Assuming that someone goes there for their own ""amusement"", he/she can still find him/herself feeling something, learning something, all the while that was not his/her intention.

And still people can definitely feel embarrassed and disgraced by their behavior.

&gt;""Enough""?

&gt;In what units are you measuring ""piety""? How can you judge someone else's feelings and thoughts?

I know what I am talking about because I live in the city where many tourists live through their vacation here mostly by their eyes literally glued to the screens of their smartphones and cameras. Therefore, they aren't focusing enough on genius loci of the place. The same thing applies to tourists in extermination camps.

&gt;It is not the same. Friends and family are attending a funeral, not strangers. Perhaps more importantly though, funeral, wake and similar practices are not the same for every country, civilization, culture etc. Some seem weird to each of us. The American wake ceremony for example is weird to me.

It is the similar and model situation where certain culture requires certain behavior and it actually doesn't matter if it is funeral, wedding or another special event which could be the visit of extermination camp. And you should behave by recommended behavior there best given by some guides or something like that.

&gt;If you want Auschwitz to be visited by many people from many cultures, you have to realize that these people will not follow, are unable to follow, your ""practices"". They don't know your practices.

I think there is a collision of our views. I (tons of others) say you should adapt to the culture and established behavior on the respective place/event. Therefore, if you are visiting e.g. Auschwitz you should learn about culture and behavior beforehand. You shouldn't force on your trip to foreign culture your own culture if it violates rules of that foreign culture.

I will give an example: You visit this subreddit and you found out by reading rules (of behavior) you shouldn't act like a homophobe (which in my example hypothetically could be your common attitude towards gays; it is just for the cause of my example).

*looks online*

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peugeot

&gt;As experienced by other European volume car makers, Peugeot's United States and Canadian sales faltered and finally became uneconomical, as the Peugeot 505 design aged.  For a time, distribution in the Canadian market was handled by Chrysler. Several ideas to turn around sales in the United States, such as including the Peugeot 205 in its lineup, were considered but not pursued. In the early 1990s, the newly introduced 405 proved uncompetitive with domestic and import models in the same market segment, and sold less than 1,000 units. Total sales fell to 4,261 units in 1990 and 2,240 through July 1991, which caused the company to cease its U.S. and Canada operations after 33 years.
&gt;
&gt;In 1997, just six years after pulling out of both United States and Canadian markets, Peugeot returned to Mexico after a 36-year absence, under the Chile–Mexico Free Trade Agreement. However Peugeot models (1992–present) cannot be bought or imported into the United States from Mexico.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/8onpmd/peugeot_halts_iran_expansion_yields_to_us/e05bns9/,vokegaf,1528204578

Perhaps if you were to exercise the same self-awareness you would see that your vision for the UK is only one of many potential paths, and the one you have chosen alienates vast swathes of the UK. These people have an equal vote to you and are equally worthy of respect, the obsessive political focus on London to their detriment is surely something you can understand causes great resentment? Perhaps if you actually sought to understand the position of your opponents and made a coherent and respectful counter-argument instead of simply insulting them your arguments would be better received. Modernism is not intrinsically better because of its place in time, chronologically everything from Aztec human sacrifice to the excesses of Stalinism are more modern than the foundation of the British constitution, an idea must be judged strictly on its merit rather than its position in history.

Sanctimony and snobbishness never win an argument in the end. Many people aren't happy with 2018 for good reasons, their employment prospects are grim because all of the businesses have moved to London where they can't afford to live. Their infrastructure on which they depend has been neglected by a government that holds anywhere outside of the M25 with contempt. Their views have been ignored and decried as anachronistic when the last 20 years have brought terrible economic changes upon their towns that they can't afford to leave because of our rotten housing market.

The Germans brutally experienced the bottomless pit of war and catastrophe from the times when there was no union.

3240,"&gt; If you don't have a legal construction similar to marriage, how do you deal with issues such as residency of your non-national partner?

Marriage is not a requirement in the Netherlands actually for that so clearly it can be done; it was removed on purpose. The rule is quite simple: You can get a visa for _one_ person from another place under the condition that the person will live with you in one address—no marriage or love or fancy sexual identification label required.

&gt; the administrative ""marriage"", which covers the more practical aspects (estate planning, shared domicile, residency, ...)

And I think this should go away too because the construct is awful and it's close to gone in the Netherlands already and it's currently mostly just a label with some minor differences from a cohabitation contract.

The important part is the cohabitation contract which is a contract like any other where people agree on property and support and all those things which is as flexible as you want to make it and can also be executed between more than two persons; it's a much better solution than the binary marriage system that a lot of states have where once you are married you also assume each other's _debts_. You can assume each other's debts here if the contract says so but most people are smart enough to leave that out.

there is no evidence any of these people you want to deport agree with the saudis in any meaningful percentage.

tehre are: if that person claims refugee status or applies for asylum, laws state they are to be taken in until their claim has been evaluated.

i dont make distinction based on religion or ethnicity when it comes to refugees. anyone fleeing the country of their birth due to persecution or war or anything is a refugee according to the un, and can apply for asylum.

&gt;Sure I can since they don't belong to minority groups and since so many of them come from peaceful countries; it's an easy evalualtion.

3476,"1. Embezzlement *is* theft. Not sure where you get your definition, but do check Oxford Dictionary. Of course, it's much more sophisticated than what you may think theft is, but it is theft nonetheless
1. Oh, it's true, those are not the worst ones. But the worst ones are also much more disputable. Those are the very agreeable ones. While fine dining once in a while would be fine, that's what ended up killing PO. And no, I don't consider flying an old lady with nothing but a known name to offer around as a justifiable expense.
1. Every country has its scandals and corruption to some extent. But Western countries have less of them. And, of course, there's no direct correlation... But the money embezzled could have been used to inject extra money into social welfare system, rather than taking from personal OFE funds. So yes, corruption inhibits *everything* in the state, including social security.

Now, to summarize. It is a fact that Scandinavia is able to provide such extensive care due to their investment of oil money. You cannot declare that false just because Finland doesn't have oil. There may be another reason for Finland specifically, but the rest is successful due to oil. Then, you took my argument completely out of context (oh, so surprising). I said another reason why Scandinavian countries are so successful in providing extensive care is much lower level of corruption. And indeed, you can see the correlation, as the countries with the strongest social security are the leas corrupted ones. Then, again, you twist my argument - I never said *actual* representation costs are bad. But flying old ladies in business class and giving millions to a corrupted priest are not actual costs, but embezzlement. And again, I never said that it defeats the purpose, it rather prevents us from having anything like it. Because, let's be honest, no one in Poland is naïve enough to think we could have such extensive social security.

It's WaPo's problem if they have chosen a pricing model that fundamentally doesn't work under GDPR because the users have been given a legal right to circumvent it. 

This is the solution offered by GDPR - in the long term, no one would offer to buy your ""consent"" because that can be immediately taken back.

For other welfare we have a social security net which means that you won't find yourself completely without money should you end up without work. The longer you are without work the less money you get. Though there is a lower limit and should you not be able to get a place to live for that limited money, a place will be provided for you.

We have a good amount of paid leave when you have a child. It can be shared between the mom and the dad, though some of it is mandatory.

When you go on maternity leave you can expect you job the still be there once you are done and want to go back.

I am not completely sure about the rules for immigrants, but they are fairly similar to the ones which apply for nationals.

One of the best parts of the social security net is really that a life destroying event, say 3 years of sickness, will not fuck you up to the point of making your life unrecoverable.

&gt;An [illiberal democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illiberal_democracy), also called a partial democracy, low intensity democracy, empty democracy, or hybrid regime,[1] is a governing system in which, although elections take place, citizens are cut off from knowledge about the activities of those who exercise real power because of the lack of civil liberties. It is not an ""open society"". There are many countries ""that are categorized as neither 'free' nor 'not free', but as 'probably free', falling somewhere between democratic and nondemocratic regimes"".[2] This may be because a constitution limiting government powers exists, but those in power ignore its liberties, or because an adequate legal constitutional framework of liberties does not exist.[3]

Yes I fucking have. What you think that American Jews don't experience in-your-face anti-semitism? Or is your point that  Europeans have it worse? Which I totally agree with:

Yes American education has its issues but if you were educated you would know that your broad generalization is well a shitty broad generalization. Meanwhile European Jews have had enough of European Antisemitism and are making Aliyah at a more concentrated time now then any other time since WW2 or the fall of the Iron Curtain. 

Antisemitic Policies:

The you have You have significant calls for circumcision bans in All of Scandinavia, the Netherlands, Iceland is about to ban it, failed in Germany, etc. Also similar calls to ban kosher slaughter in the Netherlands and in Belgium. Denmark already did banned it. Estonia has restriction on kosher slaughter. France and other who ban outward expressions of religious attire.  I bet there are others.

Moving on to politics:

Austria nearly electing a neo-Nazi party. You have Greece Neo-Nazis sorta just running around doing their thing. You got your Hungarian Fascist Dictator who uses antisemitism to further concentrate his power. ""Polish Death camps."" Russia/The Ukraine/Belorussia are just baseline antisemitic so we can move alone. The rise of the far-right in France and Germany. Nothing yet from the Italians but you know those right-wing Populists! Slovenia just voted in a party with connects to Neo-Nazis. The UK which used to only allow their antisemites to be affiliated with the Tories now has Jeremy Corbyn's Labour.  Latvia has a thing with marching Nazis. Lithuania is like Poland except less triggered. Scandinavia in general just sorta not doing anything to stop its antisemites. Switzerland is one of the most antisemitic countries in the entirety of Europe on an individual level. Croatia got a tad  bit of neo-nazis.

There are a lot of antisemitic hate crime in Germany but the government is the only one that in from top to bottom seems to actual give a shit about its Jews. Funny how this is working. Well Macron is trying but well En Marche! is top heavy so they are farting in the wind. But give Macron some credit.

Spain and Portugal are outliers and attempting to bring back Sephardic jews and being A-ok with going Kosher. No one expects the reverse inquisition. Luxembourg can come too.  

Nuetrals: Ireland, Liechtenstein, Malta, Moldova, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro.

3619,"Peugeot owner PSA has become the latest French company to signal it will pull out of Iran if it cannot get bulletproof protection from potential US sanctions.

The French carmaker said it had begun to suspend its joint ventures in Iran and will look for a waiver protecting it from US sanctions after the Trump administration pulled out of the nuclear deal.

Following the US withdrawal, PSA “began the process of suspending the activities of its JVs, in order to comply with US law by August 6, 2018. With the support of the French Government, the PSA group is in contact with US authorities to consider a waiver,” said PSA in a statement on Monday evening.

“As the PSA group’s activities in Iran represent less than 1 per cent of its turnover, this context does not alter the general objectives of the Push to Pass plan or the current financial orientations,” added PSA.

However, Iran represented a market with great potential for PSA — the carmaker signed a joint venture in 2016 to invest €400m by 2020 and sold 445,000 cars in the country last year.

Last month, Total said it would not be able to continue with its own energy project in Iran without a waiver protecting it from US sanctions, something the oil major did not think was likely.

Although PSA is not currently in the US, chief executive Carlos Tavares recently detailed plans to return to the US market after an absence of more than two decades.

Russian peacekeeping forces just did what peacekeepers are supposed to do and pointed their guns at the aggressor. There's a reason why nobody raised much of a fuss in 2008 - what Saakashvili did was totally indefensible.

Ukrainian case is more complicated, sure, but I for the life of me don't understand why in hell the group of people that forms majority in the capital is allowed to overthrow governments because it disagrees with its international policy, while the group whose government was just violently overthrown is not allowed to tell the overthrowers to fuck off. If there ever was a clear politial (not necessarily ethnic) reason for separatism - this is it. 

Obviously Russia helped, but NATO helped quite a number of separatists too (Kosovo comes to mind).

The restrictive Republican attitude gave the political Islamists the narrative of opression they needed to incite a democratic revolution; and look where Turkey is now: a complete destruction of Republican values and the takeover by Islamofascism. Political Islam was once a minority in Turkey too, but the lower class rural types have higher birth rates and a toxic ideology that disseminates virally wherever the Republic is unable to retain control: the ghetto, the banlieu, the outskirts, the new migrants to Istanbul, the rural areas with underfunded and understaffed schools.

Europe's a lot more centralized than many (in some ways arguably most) states of antiquity, and the only reason why it's not considered a state in conventional usage today is because it's now unique in its degree of decentralization and because national governments in the modern era are now implicitly endowed with certain rights, responsibilities, and distinctions that in times long ago would have been in the hands of landowners, governors, military officers, mayors, etc.",New England,/r/europe/comments/8ofkxw/the_constitution_of_the_roman_republic/e04ow00/,NewEnglishSeparatist,1528167316

&gt;ARTICLE 7  
  
&gt;  
&gt;\(1\) The French Republic, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and **the United States of America hereby terminate their rights and responsibilities relating to Berlin and to Germany as a whole**. As a result, the corresponding, related quadripartite agreements, decisions and practices are terminated and all related Four Power institutions are dissolved.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;\(2\) **The United Germany shall have accordingly full sovereignty over its internal and external affairs**.

And here is the German Federal Foreign Office's own notes on the treaty 

&gt;After the end of World War II, the presence of foreign armed forces in Germany was initially based on the law imposed by the occupying powers. This regime ended on 5 May 1955 with the entry into force of the Convention on Relations between the Three Powers and the Federal Republic of Germany of 26 May 1952 \(Federal Law Gazette 1955 II p. 303\). However, on 23 October 1954, the Convention on the Presence of Foreign Forces in the Federal Republic of Germany \(Federal Law Gazette 1955 II p. 253\) between Germany and eight partners \(Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the United States of America\) had already created a treaty basis for the continued, long‑term presence of foreign forces stationed in Germany. This open\-ended Convention remains effective following the conclusion of the Two plus Four Treaty \(Treaty on the Final Settlement with respect to Germany of 12 September 1990, Federal Law Gazette 1990 II p. 1317\), **but can now be terminated by giving two years’ notice** \(Exchange of Notes of 25 September 1990, Federal Law Gazette 1990 II p. 1390 and of 16 November 1990, Federal Law Gazette 1990 II p. 1696\).

Germany's success comes at the cost of it's own citizens. Jobs in education are extremely underpaid, people who work at universities oftentimes need to get social support. State offices employ almost exclusively interns or offer 1-year limited contracts.

[4:19](https://youtu.be/12YDLZq8rT4?t=41m19s)

CAP is a choice, not a necessity. A globalized market for food allows shocks in one location to be compensated for by importing from somewhere else. That's why famines have declined precipitously as globalization and transportation technologies have improved. Exposing our farmers to foreign competition would force them to innovate and force down prices for consumers. Uncompetitive farms going out of business just means that capital is being shifted to more productive investments elsewhere.

The logic is sound. The EU is more reliant on exports to the US than the US is on the EU, which means the EU will suffer most in a trade war.

4200,"&gt; You do realize that this has nothing to do with Judaism vs Islam, right?

Do you believe the words you type? If religion has nothing to do with this then cede East Jerusalem and all the religious churches and monuments. 

&gt;OK that makes things clearer (your sentence depends where you put the comma).

Yes English is quite fucked lol.

&gt;Even so, East Jerusalem is the Internationally recognized capital of the Palestine state. Also, Israel will not be content with East Jerusalem, which can be proved by the fact that they are making new settlements every year.

I realize that it was once their capital (Israel controls it currently obviously) but if they cede their claim to it then they will have their own state is all I'm saying. They can continue with the status quo or make a pragmatic decision that will see the lives of their children radically improve from their own. 

&gt;What I implied, and now I have to mansplain, is that the International community, should hold accountable Israel for violating International Law, conducting ethnic cleansing and not adhering to UN resolutions.

I wholeheartedly agree that they should do that but what I am saying is that in actual practice that means jack shit.

The starkest example of this imperialist domination is coffee. In 2014 Africa —the home of coffee— earned just £1.5 billion from the crop. Yet Germany, a leading processor, earned nearly double that from coffee re-exports.

The reason for this is that Africa is punished by the EU with a 7.5 per cent tariff charge on roasted coffee but non-decaffeinated green coffee is exempt. As a result, the bulk of Africa’s export to the EU is unroasted green coffee and German manufacturers reap the rewards.

The charge on cocoa is even more debilitating as the EU tariff charge is a massive30 per cent for processed cocoa products like chocolate bars or cocoa powder, and 60 per cent for some other refined products containing cocoa.

4311,"Oh i know this! Stupid people! The guy in the video is talking about stupid people! I have witnessed this multiple times so im gonna share a few of the most outragous ones have seen.

I have been to Auschwitz-Birkenau and half a dozen other camps ins southern poland every summer for 4 years, as i was part of a team training austrian volunteers (as a male in austria you do eighter military service, civil service or ""memorial service""; we we training the latter). 

The taking pictures part isnt that bad itself, as long as it is done with reason. Taking shots of your group going through the area, ok. Taking happy fotos in front of the ""Arbeit macht frei"" arc or a crematorium oven, not so much.

Anyways, the 2 most astonishingly stupidly disrespectful things i witnessed were both when we were going around on the AB area with an actual survivor (who had to work in the crematorium, burning his fellow inmates corpses).  He was very old, only kept up to spread the word and died during the years we were doing the seminars. One of the reasons i was only doing it for 4 years, and not 5 or more.

We usually said that there were no stupid questions, but one of our trainees prooved us wrong. He asked how the people inside the camp, like him, coped with the stress, did they drink a lot of alcohol?

The other incident was with a bunch of what seemed to be new yorker hassidic jews who had the balls to lecture our guide/survivor about where the crematorium ""actually"" was and how he had to be lieing or a fraud. To the guy having ""worked"" in the ACTUAL FACILITY. They were adament even after we explained who they were talking to. It was probably the most disrespectful thing i have ever witnessed.

Debt doesn't get wiped out just like that. If you can freeze it early enough, in most cases the money could be withdrawed later when things calm down. Even more importantly as people know their money will be freezed in a bank run, that reduce the incentives for one to happen. 

I don't think the US did anything well when it came to banking. They have and had a similar problem as EU with strong state rights. Canada for instance did not have a deposit insurance, and a much safer banking system.

Although I could see a deposit insurance for far smaller sums. Up to something like 20 000 euro, which is what most people need for day to day life. A bank deposit should not be a legitimate investment vehicle. If you subsidize banking, you compete out other forms of investments as for instance passive mutual funds (which I would recommend over a bank).

My main point isn't about deposit insurance at all though. There is a risk that in the next crisis countries will try to insure even more risky financial insitutions.

4328,"&gt; Of course they are Islamists, they are just as radical.

Lol, no. They're left to centre left, and in the socialist international. They're self-declared seculars. So, let's don't make up things.

&gt; Can you give me a list of secular Muslim states? Just so I know, last time I checked the most democratic  Muslim state was Malaysia. And that is not a secular state.

Kazakhstan, Turkey, Bosnia, North Cyprus, Albania, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan, Egypt, Syria, Tunisia. I'm sure I'm missing some but anyway.

Most democratic country with a Muslim population isn't Malaysia either, lol.

&gt; Like which other Arab Muslim country? Or any Muslim country for that matter?

Mate, there are secular Arab countries like Iraq, Syria, Egypt and all the ones that had Arab socialism were secular. Many states with Muslim populations are also more secular than Israel and at least half of the European countries with Christian majority.

&gt; If you already owned a significant portion of the land

Like 10%? And no, it doesn't work like that. Turks do have neighbourhoods in Berlin, or Somalians and other have those in Sweden yet they can't claim independence.

&gt; the other inhabitants didn't want to give you equal citizenship rights then of course

Maybe that was because you wanted the land for yourself?

&gt; Do you also think the Kurds or the Assyrians should not have their own land? 

Kurds shouldn't have their own state in Istanbul for example, even though their largest population is there. Simple as that.

&gt; I would never give land back that was originally mine or part of an agreement which the other side broke and that I am now in control of unless it was to the benefit of a lasting peace. I have not seen a single shred of evidence that the Palestinian leadership desire peace.

Mate, go back the your legal borders aka '48 borders, give people the right of return and sure they'll accept. Palestinians tried for a peace, but couldn't find a mid way since your right wing expensionist govts.

&gt; But Judaism does not claim it was written BY God as there are different source texts that does not correspond to each other.

Yes, because ten commandements were written by me, and Jewish prophets haven't claimed that it was God's words. Come on mate, only different one is Christianity in that sense.

&gt; So? Plenty of the Palestinians were second or third generation immigrants in 1947. Will you kick those out or what? Deny them access to the land that they were born in because ""things changed""?

Mate, I'm not suggesting that Jews should be kicked out. I'm pointing out that why Palestinians were righteous back then for not accepting some immigrants declaring their own state on their lands. What has been done is done, now you need to find some way to live with each other..

&gt; No.

Yes.

&gt; So? Egypt invaded Gaza and Jordan invaded West Bank. Doesn't seem to matter to you at all

Oh, you can read my mind now.

&gt; only seems to be a problem when Jews does the invading.

I don't care if it was Jews or Indians. If the local native inhabitants aren't welcoming any annexation or invasion, than of course I do have a problem with it.

&gt;They owned more but more significantly, they owned roughly 50% of all the urban areas including all the urban areas in the West Bank. Further more, the ""10%"" is ALL of Palestine mandate and the original plan was to give the Jews much less than 50%. And that was not acceptable to the Arabs, they wanted 100%,

Oh, some population didn't wanted to some immigrants to take over their lands, how shocking. And sure, owning 10% gives you right to take over nearly half of the land. /s Let's buy 10% of the Israel and declare a state on the half of it. If you refuse, let's invade it and cleanse you. Sure, it would have been righteous. /s

&gt; First off, you would have to buy it in accordance what the Arabs charged the Jews which was roughly 10 times the market prices.

You mean folks don't even live in the Palestine but own the land? Sure, so if somehow we can buy 10% of the land, I can kick you out of your house, and declare a state on the half of Israel. Come on...

&gt; Probably yes but we all know that sometimes the Arabs gather together with some help from another major power like Russia, Iran or Turkey or whatever and try to do their best to play Hitler. It has happened quite a few times already and it is not in the best of interest of world peace to cause a major war in the Middle East.

Turkey has been sided with Israel for a long long time. And heck, sure Russia tries to exterminate Jews, as well as Iran. Seriously? You can do without the financial help, but can't do anything without US vetoing things.

They get on the train, the train starts chugging and after about an hour they start seeing snowfall and pine trees.

&gt;""Ethnicity"" is often used in a sense close to one traditionally attributed to ""race"": the division of human groups based on qualities assumed to be essential or innate to the group (e.g. shared ancestry or shared behavior). Therefore, racism and racial discrimination are often used to describe discrimination on an ethnic or cultural basis, independent of whether these differences are described as racial. According to a United Nationsconvention on racial discrimination, there is no distinction between the terms ""racial"" and ""ethnic"" discrimination.

4474,"&gt;Does anyone have an idea why Merkel took so many refugees ... ?

- u/marzDK 

&gt;The sudden invitation in September 2015 to what was to become roughly a million migrants entering Germany—and, ipso facto, the Schengen zone and the European Union—served German needs, both domestic and international, and was extended without consultation with Germany’s European partners. Domestically, it was intended to prepare a change of coalition in 2017, by helping Merkel overcome the “ice queen” image she had contracted when, early in 2015, she explained on a live TV show to a crying Palestinian refugee girl about to be deported that “we cannot take all of you.” Internationally, it responded, by “showing a friendly face,” to the controversy over the latest “austerity” diktat delivered to Greece in June 2015, which had provoked a wave of cartoons all over Europe portraying Merkel and Schäuble in Wehrmacht uniforms adorned with swastikas.

From ""[Europe under Merkel IV: Balance of Impotence](https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2018/05/europe-under-merkel-iv-balance-of-impotence/)"" by Wolfgang Streeck, emeritus director of the Max Planck Institute for the Study of Societies in Cologne.

Like the story about Herakles' venture to Hades to save Theseus who was in a deep trance sitting in a chair. Herakles freed him with sheer brute strenght and a small part of Theseus' thigh was stuck in the chair. That's why Athenians have small thighs.

Or how Kastor and Pollux rescued Helen from Athens were Theseus had abducted her. Or how the Greeks needed the bow of Herakles' to succesfully besiege Troy which they had to get from his son who was somewhere in Asia Minor in some King's court. Or how Helenus, prince of Troy became King of Epirus and prophesized the founding of Rome by Aineias and Brescia (called Altilia literally meaning ""other Troy"" in Greek, by Trojan fugitives). Or how the sons of Hercules invaded the Peloponesse to reclaim their ancestor's legacy and how these people later were called Dorians. Or all the fucking stuff about Hercules' journeys in Europe that get overshadowed by his labours. Or the war between Argos and Thebes with all the warlords in both sides 1v1ing each other and eventually dying, except from the Leader of the Argian forces.

These are only a few less known stories from the top of my head that took place in ANCIENT times. There is another ton of stuff from the Hellenistic era, for example the isle of Bahrain was called Tylos and it's capital Manama was found by Greek setlers.

4539,"&gt;No, the system allows them live however they wish. The system doesn’t force their way onto others.

The system technically allows them to live however they wish, but it encourages people to live how the system wants them to. Sure, you *can* become self-sustainable, but then you must learn everything from scratch and virtually no one does that. School system surely teaches you a ridiculous amount about mathematics with very little use in real life, but never anything that helps you to become self-sustainable or something else. Because the goal is to SPECIALIZE to the numerous of demanding jobs the system requires. Greed for money is the only common value in the society, and our nations must enforce that because they're in the leash of the multinational financial interests. 

&gt;Traditions and values shouldn’t just be maintained because they already exist. ... 

Traditions and values are the glue that sticks a community together. Questioning them is one thing, and completely killing them off for the sake of superficial individualism is another. If all we eat is avocado pastas and McDonald's, what will happen to our traditional cuisines? If all culture we enjoy is over-commercialized superhero movies and soulless music optimized to generate most money, what happens to our own culture?

&gt; Don’t try to argue that we have somehow drifted from your fantasy past “ideal community”. 

We have. Not long ago, a community was VITAL for one's survival and all of those communities practiced whatever they wanted to practice. Nowadays it's not vital anymore because the machine around you takes care of everything and you're just an individual whose only job is to maintain the machine.

&gt;Because I can tell you, that 99% of human communities for the first 180,000 years of society were polygamous.

Polygamy has generally only been practiced by the elite of the society. Majority of people have always had it better in monogamous relationships. Do you really think it creates a stable society if one male has all the women and rest of them are sexually frustrated? At best, they would just kill their dominant male and share the women. 

&gt;People say, “this time is different”, every time. It’s like how there’s a new date for the apocalypse every few years. 

Well, our modern world has precisely two possible endpoints: 

1. It will collapse because infinite growth on a finite planet is not possible. 

2. It will evolve into a *Brave New World* kind of dystopia.

&gt;I mean, what “propaganda” are you even talking about. Advertising? Because most people are self aware enough to know how it effects them (where I live, at least, people mostly make fun of advertisements). ...

So how come corporate propaganda still exists? Why are people so indifferent towards external manipulation? If advertising didn't work, no one would advertise... No matter how much we make fun of it or pretend it doesn't affect us, it does. The only way to avoid that is to avoid advertisements in the first place, and that is becoming harder and harder all the time. 

&gt;Do you not see how completely menaningless and vague the words you are using are. ....

I doubt that, because it's not long ago when people didn't have this much material abundance. Laziness is a fucking virtue nowadays, even though it wasn't even an option few centuries ago... 

&gt;It’s the equivalent to people complaining about younger generations being dumber. It’s timeless, and everywhere. It’s a completely meaningless term.

Yes, I am a hedonist too because the society has conditioned me into it. But it's still bad for me, bad for my culture and bad for my society. At no point in history has hedonism been this prevalent as it is in modern society. In most life situations, hedonism is really the only alternative to chronic boredom.

&gt;Politics does offer an “alternative”. What you need to understand is, most people don’t want one.

Politics haven't offered an alternative for the last 30 years after the Soviet Union fell... Of course people don't want an alternative because this is the only system that rewards people for doing absolutely nothing worthwhile. Of course people want to maintain it even if it destroys everything that has some real value. Just like lab rats who rather pull a lever that gives a rewarding stimulus than a lever that gives food and water.  It takes self-discipline and the collective pressure of your society to unhook yourself from that. 

&gt;Alright, let’s do what you’re saying, in another example. Well, in theory, if we only cared about numbers, we should harvest the organs of a single healthy person to help the rest get back to full health. 

You are missing the point... In our modern society, we are doing exactly that. Our societies are ran by information and data and numbers and equations, not by us. Our society is the one making organ harvesting after death the norm, no the exception. My point is not to say that every individual must be sacrificed for the greater good, my point is that individual will always work in the context of the society. There's a reason why you don't shit in the middle of the street even if you could. It's against the social norms in most societies. 

&gt;Yet for some reason, everyone in our society is horrified by the idea. That’s because, it’s obvious to everyone, that a society which does not place individual choice over the “greater beneficial culture goal” is absolutely insane.

Individual choice is often irrational. Only the people around him can correct him and guide him to the (perceived) right path. That's the way social animals like humans work, and now we are eroding that and making people to submit to an alien system that only pursues its own goals instead of making people work towards the well-being of themselves and the people around him... 

&gt;But also, don’t you see how personally hypocritical you are being. You are against “the context of your society and its values“. Most people find your opinions extremly disagreeable. ... Otherwise the only “degenerate” and “hedonistic” force is you.

What is my society? All the separate individuals around me, pursuing the interests of the system because it offers them rewarding stimulus? My family that I'm soon about to abandon when I must go SPECIALIZE to serve the system? I want a society ran by people, not a machine where people are cogs in the cogwheels pursuing some distant interests of someone else. The only reason why society is in this state in the first place is because people have been manipulated by the system. 

&gt;Yes, there were certainly people who felt it did. ... We even have records of people saying that writing itself was eroding society, and leading people away from a correct “simpler life”

People have always complained about the evolving values and culture, that's true. But the thing is that the culture is not only changing now, it's also DYING. Look at the amount of minority languages going extinct. Look at the number of different customs and traditions falling into obscurity. Look at the number of indigenous beliefs and religions being replaced by organized religion and even atheism. All being replaced by this multinational and overwhelming consumerist ""culture"" of whatever is trendy and has a good brand. 

Again, at no point in history has the society been this overwhelming and distant as it is now. In the past you hunted a fucking buffalo when you were hungry, now your food goes through a huge process and travels possibly even thousands of kilometers to reach your nearest supermarket. You work directly towards very few things nowadays, you just throw imaginary money towards issues and wait the system to fix them. It's extremely inefficient and waste of human potential. It's also ecologically detrimental. 

&gt;I’m sorry if you feel that way. That’s not how most people feel. Ask around,...  people would say they feel their lives have value. 

Apparently not because they rather spend their time and energy in pursuing the interests of the system, and not the interests of themselves and the people around them. It's not normal to care about pressing a button in an office more than taking care of your parents or grandparents. It's not normal to outsource their care to a facility and to people who only do it for money. 

&gt; But there’s the thing. You’ll probably call this cynical of me. But I feel that most people are fully aware of everything your saying.

Then how come they still continue doing this? Why they continue on this destructive path if they're aware of its issues? Yes, I believe they are aware of the many issues, but it also requires concrete action, not just acknowledgment. 

&gt;What you need to understand, is that if we tried becoming a collectivist society, it would fail. Not only because the idea is inherently contradictory and immoral. 

Collectivism means a value where the group as a whole is more important than the individual. That's why the individual must adhere to certain collective norms and values. There is nothing immoral in that. That's how social animals work. We don't have to create a Soviet Union 2.0... 

&gt;But because our current system, with all its flaws, is what most people, even with no “propaganda” influencing them, actually want.

No, people want to fulfill their basic needs so they can self-actualize and pursue higher virtues and culture. Everything else is just a bonus. It is most definitely possible without this individualistic totalitarianism. This is not our only option, and we should stop pretending that it is. I mean yeah, we managed to fit computers the size of houses into our pockets thanks to this system. Cool. But what now? Now we're just making these pocket computers a bit faster... Law of diminishing returns and so on...

4678,"ok. First, ebike is a regulated EU name. It means that the bike will be only able to assist the rider, up to 25km/h and with an electric engine no more than 300W in power. So it makes going at 25km/h on flat terrain almost effortless \(if you use the most heavily assisted mode\). It also makes getting up hills with a relatively low inclination really easy. The issues arise when the inclination gets steep, as the 300W engine won't be able to assist enough to make the hike up easy.   

100km rides on ebikes are possible, but you'll need some kind of extended battery on it. Standard ratings are 90km on flat terrain and Eco mode for basic ebikes.   

There are also ""speed bikes"", which are basically electric scooters, able to go up to 45km/h without any user actions but are regulated as scooters \(license plates, mandatory helmets, etc...\)",France,/r/europe/comments/8oafub/bycicle_lanes_in_europe_we_cant_see_the/e03180o/,Djaaf,1528104621

4691,"&gt;Someone from the uk or france in a different european country is already pretty close culturally that they are kind of assimilated by default.

That's not really true \- no one in Latvia would say an Englishman is assimilated, if they came to live here. Assimilation is a complete dropping of your original native culture and identity, and embracing the culture of the state as your own. Just because English culture is similar to ours and allows easy integration does not mean it's an automatic assimilated person. 

&gt; How can you reconcile competely opposing values in certain areas? Meeting somewhere in the middle for womens rights, gays or similar things is not possible or desireble.  

I'd ask those ''kind of assimilated'' Poles and Lithuanians in the UK what they think of gay rights. 

&gt; Meeting somewhere in the middle for womens rights, gays or similar things is not possible or desireble.  

You're right, but my point is that you can't just judge one minority while ignoring the other. If you're willing to tolerate immigrants not being okay with gay rights \(or adoption\), you can't cherry pick that. And if gay rights are a crucial part of your culture \- what do you do with locals who disagree with gay rights? 

&gt; I personally don't think we or they \(the ones competely unwilling to assimilate\) will benefit longterm from this strained coexistence without any compromise on their part. It's going to keep going the cycle of poverty and isolation and sometimes resulting in extremism. The goal for those people should be the return to whatever society suits them better. 

The issue is that you're trying to turn it into the responsibility of the migrant \- which on paper is correct, but in reality is an absolute failure for most people, as even well educated migrants don't always assimilate on their own without either private or public programmes. The lessez faire approach towards integration and assimilation was what led to the ghetto populations in Western Europe \- it's naive to believe people will spend time and effort to integrate if there is not a demand for it.

I mean, the EU has waaaay bigger problems than saving some trees. 

Edit: 

Don't get me wrong, I love earth.
 
However, if anyone thinks that the environment is one of the most important European problems to be focussing on right now - and it really looks like this is the case because of all the environmental laws being pushed - then he has his priorities wrong. 
A quarter of EU member states is still corrupt as shit, their people living in poverty and here is the EU; spending billions to force-create environmental laws.   

I think if we don't block technological development with environmental restrictions, we'd find a solution to our environmental problems ultimately.

Edit 2: 

I deem the prevailing of justice and therefor also the destruction of injustice in one's life more important than the environment, whatever the indirect causes. The environment can be saved by any- and everyone, rooting out corruption and promoting proper wealth distribution can only be achieved by the EU.

Din cate stiu de la cineva, se poate face Transfagarasanul si atunci cand este inchis pentru masini, cu urmatoarele mentiuni. 
1. tunelul de la balea este inchis cu lacat pentru accesul masinilor insa exista o cale de acces pt oameni, dar nu este luminat (cel ce a facut asta se gandea daca nu cumva vreun urs si-a facut barlog acolo) 
2. sunt zone unde este gheata/polei pe asfalt si e nevoie de extra atentie. 
 
Translation: From all I know from someone, you can do the Transfagarasan route even when it's closed for cars, with the next mentions:

1. The tunnel at Balea is closed with a locket for cars but there is another passage for humans, it's not lighted. (My friend that did this route was thinking if there were any bears there).

2. There are places where there is ice on the asphalt and you need extra attention in those places.

This actually isn't true. The cow is to be put to sleep because of EU laws. It violated EU law that states that cattle should have accompanying valid certificate for health and presence of doctor when entering EU borders. I heard some Serbian vet tried to issue such document when the cow was being returned to Bulgaria, but it was illegitimate. If it was Bulgarian law nobody would give a damn and the cow was going to be left alone, but hey EU laws..we have to obey. 

To be honest, 99% of the blame is to the border police where the cow just passed the official border entry point. They say they did try to stop it but the cow ""forced its way"" ... I'm guessing if they can't stop a cow at the border what exactly they can stop? Probably no one cared and they had a laugh, but now the animal is to be killed because of that.

What is Italy Syndrome? Physicians say it is a medical-social phenomenon that affects women who go to work abroad and under stressful work and living conditions develops mental disorders. Thousands of Romanian women suffer from psychological problems caused by children and country longing. Libertatea.ro today launches a campaign to raise awareness of a phenomenon that affects thousands, tens of thousands of families. Those who go abroad to work.

SUMMARY:
-  In this episode of the Campaign ""Italy Syndrome"" explains exactly what Italy's syndrome means and how it affects women who go to work abroad.
- Italy's syndrome is a medical and social phenomenon, not a disease in itself, which embraces the psychological disturbances suffered by women from Eastern Europe who have gone abroad and have worked as caregivers of elderly people, meaning „badante” (n.r italian meaning for caregiver).
- Italy's syndrome is the name given to this phenomenon by two psychiatrists in Ukraine in 2005, and was taken over by doctors across Europe.
- Only last year at the Socola Institute of Psychology in Iasi county, Romania, were hospitalized 150 women with home-related disorders.
- Symptoms: depression, lack of appetite and appetite, fatigue, insomnia, pain, suicidal thoughts.
-Patient profile: A woman around 45-50 years old who has left and worked abroad in recent years under stressful conditions, away from children and home, mostly without studies or with secondary education.
- Italy's syndrome is not just about Italy. I can develop mental disorders people who have worked in other countries too, the common element being workplace stress and uprooting, family retreat.

Further, the article contains the testimonies of women admitted to psychiatry diagnosed with the Italy Syndrome, as well as the doctors testimonies who take care of them.

However, russification is not only about population migration, but also about culture, alphabet, and language, these things being regularly tempered with both under the Russian Empire and the USSR things getting to dehumanizing standards under the USSR. Basarabia was annexed in 1812. The union of the principalities happened in 1859. It lasted 4 years because the union became a Romanian Union, the Union of Romanian principalities. Which eventually paved the way for the Kingdom of Romania 1881, kingdom which Basarabia voted to unify with in the 20th century after world war 1. It wasn't until the mass deportations and ethnic cleansing under Stalin that the concept of Moldovenism was invented. The origins of this are not even from Basarabia or Moldova.

I disagree. Unless there is another war in Europe it will still be massively important. It will mark the borders of Poland/Germany.

4903,"&gt; The only thing that binds NATO countries together is Russia. That's not really much to call it a ""sphere of influence"".

Makes you wonder what would've happened if Russia joined NATO, as none other than Putin jokingly suggested back in the day.

&gt; The EU is also not defined by a boss-servant relationship. It is about cooperation between the members. There is no equivalent to Russia dictating and asserting influence over ""lesser"" states. But yes, cooperation has indeed better benefits than soviet style rule.

The EU is very much a vehicle of German economic hegemony, as we've seen recently. Southern and Eastern Europe are absolutely Germany's economic ""sphere of influence"", even though the EU isn't politically authoritarian. 

Suggesting that the EU is completely equal, with no stronger and weaker states, is pretty ridiculous. Polish and Baltic complaints over Germany's gas pipeline with Russia didn't matter one bit to the guys who actually make EU policy. 

&gt; Anyways, equaling Russia's attempts to create and maintain a sphere of influence, with its wars in Chechnya, Georgia or Ukraine, and the EU's eastern expansion requires quite a distorted and biased view.

The EU's eastern expansion isn't comparable to the wars in Georgia or Ukraine, but the EU support for breakway states in Yugoslavia is.

5017,"&gt; I already gave an example. New candidates cannot easily emerge in a system with strategic voting. If you want a particular example just look at the US.

Of course they can, they just have to make people strategically vote for them! And I've a great example: it's Macron the candidate who managed to capitalize the non populist, centrist vote.

The issue with the US isn't new candidates but multiple: the outdated electoral system, the political culture, the way the entire system is designed for perpetuating the Democrats and the Republicans as the only game in town and so on. 

&gt;In my opinion a president should not be making policy. They should be implementing policy. As I said, an ideal president is an employee to the legislature. One which can be easily fired when they're not doing their job. Impeachment is not always easy, and can easily be framed as undemocratic.

That's your opinion, however for proponents of presidential systems that isn't the way things should be. For them the presidential office is the executive arm and not a mostly symbolic tutelage figure. Again impeachment might be framed as undemocratic but it isn't, an argument I don't suppose you'll make as adept of parliamentarianism as it relies mostly on the legislature acting within it's rights.

&gt;I don't see an issue with long negotiations either. You bring up the inefficiency of negotiating with 20 parties, but the very idea of parties negotiating is also undemocratic. You'd be working with the biggest minority of the biggest minority. Who are you even representing in the end? It looks like 50%, but really it's 5.

Ah so everything is undemocratic to you. How come? It's impossible to have serious discussion if you insist on declaring everything undemocratic (without a clear base on why).

5096,"OP, I am not sure if you got this particular piece of news off of [publika.md](https://publika.md) just this once or if you read it regularly, but that is one of the worst sources you can subscribe to, as it is owned by Vladimir Plahotniuc \(Moldova's unofficial Lukashenko basically\) and is therefore highly censored / full of bullshit, although it may not seem like it cause of its snazzy interface. 

For future reference, I would recommend avoiding Publika, Prime, Canal 2, and Canal3 \(all owned by Pahotniuc\), or at least balancing them out with the news from [jurnal.md](https://jurnal.md). The latter is just as biased, but in a counter\-Plahotniuc way. 

Our public broadcasting channels \(Moldova 1 and Moldova 2\) are way too underfunded to provide any sort of quality news, which is reinforced by the fact that Plahotniuc owns the public sector and does not allow smearing campaigns on the media.

Most other smaller news sources that I'm aware of are also quite biased, but in different directions. For example, you could trust most content on [unimedia.info](https://unimedia.info) except everything having to do with the unification between Moldova and Romania \(as they are overwhelmingly in favor of it and will embellish the shit out of  any related piece of news\).

My go\-to Moldovan news source is [protv.md](https://protv.md), as they are the closest thing we have to independent media. The only thing they never talk about is Plahotniuc. They neither praise him nor shit on him, except on rare occassions when they publish one of his press releases, without any additional comments. I think this is the main reason Protv has survived until now.

An honorary mention: [crimemoldova.com](https://crimemoldova.com) also seems quite independent, they mainly cover illegal activities done by public figures in Moldova, but few people take them seriously. I am not sure why but I speculate it is because most of their content is rather close to conspiracy theories, in that its based on investigative journalism, with no legal proof to back up their claims.

5097,"You may have too high expectations about what a federalized system would entail. US states can go bankrupt, for example. Last year (I don't have more recent data) Illinois was judged to have such a high risk of bankruptcy that they had to pay 6% interest rates, while the US had to pay only 3% on the federal level. 

In a federal union, the state and federal levels are separated, and of course the federal level decides on how the federal money is spent (i.e. *not* on things that are the states' responsibilities), and the federal level does not take over state debt. This is the same principle I was writing about.  

Maybe we understand the term ""debt union"" differently, but according to my understanding of the term, the US is not a debt union. Recall what I wrote about the future EU situation 

&gt;""I am all for uniting Europe more, also on the budget level. But whatever the solution in this case will be, it will not be a solution that will allow countries with internal problems to evade addressing their problems by easily getting money from other countries, and it will be a solution that will come with a severe loss of national sovereignty.""

Yes, because Art. 11 and Art. 13 of the copyright proposal are supported by the whole industry, not just Axel Springer or two or three other companies that you might ideologically oppose.

Second, I won't engage in a battle with you on all the points that you have mentioned above, as I won't convince you and you won't convince me. I just encourage everyone who's interested in these issues to question what is being said here, including by me, and to form their own opinion. Please always have a look at the arguments of both sides. Contrary to you and your friends the U.S. platforms, the media and creative sectors are playing fair game and are actually open about whose interest they represent. 

* The ""innovative publishers"" you mention for example. The reason why they oppose the right is because of their openly disclosed association with Google. Please just have a look at the website of the [AEEPP](http://www.aeepp.com/) which initiated this whole thing. It is right there. On the front page of their website. Also, Art. 11 is supported by the whole press publishing sector in Europe, especially smaller publishing houses are desperately in need of stronger legal protection.

* The DJV, as well as the EFJ and IFJ, the European journalists' unions are actually supportive of the right under certain conditions. You also know that very well. So instead of referring to positions dating back to 2015, maybe you should have a look at more recent press releases, which clearly state that [journalists are opposing what your MEP is suggesting as an alternative solution](https://www.djv.de/startseite/profil/der-djv/pressebereich-download/pressemitteilungen/detail/article/eu-verlegerrecht-ist-murks.html), even calling it ""harmful to their financial interests"".

Please stop claiming that you are supporting creators and journalists and just play fair game. Be open about it and finally admit who will be benefiting from weakening the protection of creators and producers in the European Union. 

Also, to respond to your question, I have been following this issue since the proposal has been published in 2016. I am not working for any company involved in the debate.

I hope that your goal as well is to defend the independent media and creative sectors, but, unfortunately, I sincerely doubt it.

Just because governments are freeing up our necessary responsibilities to our families doesn't mean we *have to* abandon them. If people choose to distance themselves from their parents, kids, or whatever, then maybe they have good reasons for that? 

The one part where I (and I think most people) agree with you is with parents and kids while they are young. Because family is clearly a very important part of a kids life. But when they grow up into adults I don't see what's wrong with freeing them up to choose for themselves.

5133,"&gt;alright thanks for correcting me. Could the Flemish culture be considered close to Dutch though?

Yes they are very close however there are some differences, for instance the Flemish are catholic and the Dutch are (primarily) Protestant. Today that won't have much relevance however this divide did create two different mentalities and culture. For instance Dutch people are way more open and blunt when speaking to people and Flemish people are more reserved (mind their own business) and careful when speaking to people they don't know. I don't know if you can read Dutch but this [article](https://doorbraak.be/cultuurverschillen-nederland-en-vlaanderen-groter-dan-met-andere-landen/) might help you more.

&gt;I personally would classify both German and Austrian as being part of a German cultural group so to say.

Well you're not wrong for saying that per se. But it would be wrong to say that Austrians are descendants from Germans.

5147,"&gt; At most they will relax food standards temporarily to allow North African produce in or pay more for their beef from NZ

The issue is capacity at ports to handle all the imports with new customs procedures.  Currently this is not an issue since anything that comes from the EU can arrive at any port in the UK (even a small ferry port) with no checks. After brexit, imports would have to come to a port that has customs infrastructure (so, for example, most ferry terminals wouldn't be suitable).

Even if the UK does not impose tarrifs, these imports would be classed as zero-tarrif and would need to go through some sort of customs.

The EU would have plenty of food to sell the UK, the difficulty is getting it into the country in a timely fashion.  This would be the case whatever its origin.  If you delay lettuce by a few days in a truck, it's not going to be very edible when it arrives (even sourcing it from Morocco is difficult).

One option would be to unilaterally throw all borders open completely for months at least until the situation is resolved.  In the meantime, the damage to local industry is likely to harmed significantly (e.g. car exports to the EU taxed at 10%, but imports arrive tax free).  Of course, no borders like this would basically mean no food standards, or checking a very miniscule fraction of the food that comes in.",Scotland,/r/europe/comments/8o9lbs/leaked_uk_government_outlines_three_different/e02c27d/,spiz,1528068645

Also, The Yugoslav government under Miloshevic was trying to create a Greater Serbia. Don’t even try to challange that fact.

Furthermore, it is true that Albanians supports the thought of an Ethnic Albania (Greater Albania), but most of them also think that this won’t happen any time soon.

5255,"&gt; You don't see a problem letting in millions of people belonging to a death sect that are taught from childhood that Jews are descendants of apes and pigs and that they will get killed by Allah?

I think that's unrelated to what I've said. No, I don't support such weird interpretations nor support even the mainstream Islamism.

&gt; Have you read the Quran? It actually demands Muslims not to make peace with non-Muslims if the Muslims are in higher numbers.

I've read the Koran, and sorry but can't recall such a thing. It's also not a religious war, nor we're arguing which religion is better. I mean, if you're for it, let's back socialist Palestinan organisions which led by a Christian once, or the nationalist secular ones. I'm sure if we're to compare holy books by the way, Jewish ones are to be the worst...

&gt; The only way to do that would be to make these Palestinians non-citizens, which would essentially make Israel a non-democracy.

Mate, Jews were the ones colonised the land. If they weren't for it, they could just find another place. You can't simply find a living space for yourself, nor deny natives and rightful owners their rights.

&gt; Really? Why do you believe that? Why didn't they accept the first proposals then when they would get roughly 90% of the land, including land owned by Jews?

Probably because they didn't wanted to lose half of their lands? Would anyone in Israel accept if suddenly half of the land is to be given to another state and some immigrants, including your house and so on?

&gt; If you are talking about the West Bank sure, parts of it is being colonized. On the other hand, it is not a very densly populated area and they are contributing to the economy of Palestine. The BDS movement hit the Palestinian economy harder than the Israeli.

Those parts also comes up with additional areas which simply forces out the Palestinians. Israel is simply colonising more and more, and eating far more lands than the area of the settlements.

&gt; Because of political reasons.

Self identifying as an ethnicity is pretty much a political act.

&gt; . They know they get money from the international community if they claim they are different.

They're not making up an ethnic group for money mate, come on, that's low effort.

&gt; Palestine has gotten MUCH more money than ALL the WW2 axis powers got COMBINED. People complain all the time about some subsidized US weapons Israel gets, Palestine gets international aid for raising kids that are confirmed suicide bombers.

Suicide bombings and Islamists became a thing pretty recently, aka during the Second Intifada and it was both thanks to Israeli terror and the fact that Israel allowed and even supported Islamists for the sake of weakening left wing Palestinian groups and secular Fatah.

Palestine also gets money for the sake of allowing people to live. Israel gets money for covering its military budget and it gets weapons...

&gt; Really? Name one more democratic Muslim state than Israel?

What the hell is a Muslim state? Declared Islamic states aren't democratic as you can guess, but I'm sure I can name tons of more secular states with Muslim populations than Israel.

I also don't get how it's related to me saying Islamism in Palestine emerged due to Israeli terror, hardships, conflict itself and so on. ",An Adjar in Tuscany,/r/europe/comments/8o79ux/israeli_minister_says_eu_can_go_to_a_thousand/e0259tj/,adjarteapot,1528061094

5259,"Ooof, where to start...

The guy was the face of revolution '89 in Slovenia. He was arrested for his article in the magazine *Mladina* which exposed the Yugoslav People's Army plans for a coup in Slovenia; the protests which subsequently erupted were the largest in Slovenian history and definitely convinced Slovenian communists that they have to relinquish power and call for democratic elections. As a leading member of the DEMOS coalition which carried those elections, Janša became the Slovenian defence minister. In that function he was the mastermind behind arming the fledgling Slovenian army and a large part of credit for making the Ten-Day War such a fiasco for Yugoslavia goes to him. And that's where the ugly starts.

During the rearmament of Slovenia Janša made a lot of contacts in the international semi-legal weapons market, and Slovenian army captured a lot of Yugoslav weapons during the war. The Slovenian government decided to sell the surplus weapons to Croatia and Bosnia. A lot of those weapons were paid for in cash, and a lot of that cash disappeared in Janša's and others' pockets. To top it off, Slovenian special forces and the military intelligence became essentially his enforcers, who went as far as to attempt kidnapping a Greek arms dealer who had some unfinished business with Janša. The police started secretly investigating Janša for corruption in the arms deals. Janša found out, and had the military intelligence service and special forces detaining and brutally beating the police agent on the case. Thus he broke the constitution, since in Slovenia military services aren't allowed to arrest civilians. In 1994 he was kicked out of MoD and charged with overstepping his authority: Janša managed to delay the trial for so long that the statute of limitations expired in 2003.

In the meantime, Janša's SDS party moved to hard right and marginalized the Christian Democrats and agrarian People's Party to become the dominant force on the Slovenian right, winning the 2004 elections. His first four year mandate was... Well, ugly. He was already obsessed with conspiracies about a cabal of ex-UDBA (Yugoslav secret service) officers, communist aparatchiks and mafia running Slovenia from the shadows, going as far as doxxing leftist intellectuals and activists. Now he also started with historical revisionism, whitewashing the collaboration in Slovenia during WW2 and discrediting the communist resistance. All of that created an ugly, polarized climate in Slovenia and made Janša extremely unpopular - except among nationalists. And that's without going into his trampling of press freedom and economical shenanigans. He lost the 2008 elections and returned to opposition.

During the Pahor cabinet the Patria affair broke out. Basically, during his mandate, Janša made a deal with the Finnish Patria AMV company to buy 150 of their IFV's. The deal included a hefty bribe paid to Janša. Janša was charged with corruption, but he again started with obstruction tacticts which served him well during his last affair. The trial was still ongoing when Pahor cabinet fell in late 2012 and Janša managed to become the PM again - despite his trial. His second rule lasted for just over a year, when his coalition fell apart and he lost the parliamentary vote of confidence amidst massive protests all over Slovenia. Those protest were caused by the economic downturn in Slovenia, aggravated by Janša's liberal loan taking in 2004-2008, and his again liberal bailing out of the banks in 2011-12. Less than three months after he was booted out, he was convicted to two years imprisonment for corruption. 

He was re-elected for a MP during his prison sentence during his imprisonment. His sentence was annulled by the Constitutional Court (where most of the judges were appointed during Janša's second PM term). He kept rather quiet for most of the Cerar mandate, and now it seems he's making yet another comeback.",Istria/Styria,/r/europe/comments/8o1wvj/slovenian_parliamentary_elections_megathread/e025a64/,suberEE,1528061104

Events

In March 2001, the reactor building of Unit 3 was evacuated with 131 people, apparently due to a false alarm. No one was hurt and there were no radiation releases.

Eight workers were exposed to radiation in March 2005.

On March 12, 2008, an employee was exposed to about 1/20 of the annual maximum allowed dose.

On 28 February 2013, two contract workers have died and a third seriously injured in an accident during maintenance work in a reactor building. They were working on a platform which appears to have become detached, dropping the workers several meters to the floor below.

On June 7, 2013, the power transformer of unit 1 caught fire. The block turned itself off automatically and nobody was hurt.

On June 11, 2013, the power transformer of unit 3 caught fire. Polychlorinated biphenyl has been used in the construction of the transformer, which is known to be toxic and carcinogenic when inhaled.

On the evening of January 31, 2017, around 10pm, an administrative building caught fire. The reactors were not shut down and continued normal operation after the fire.

5354,"A debt and budget union would require the EU to have a strong say in setting the individual countries' budgets. For any system to work you need to allocate the responsibility at the level where the decision is made. So if the EU were to take over debt (the responsibility), the EU would have to approve the budget that leads to the debt (the decision). Most countries would be against this. Not even Greece at its weakest point was in favour of such a solution, due to the loss of sovereignty that this would involve. 

So currently the only viable solution is to have a Eurozone budget to help struggling countries out, similar to Macron's proposal. I think this would only work if in return France would be willing to severely cut agricultural subsidies, otherwise the Northern and Eastern countries would not be willing to take up the burden. 

You would also have to find a solution to things like bad management, corruption and tax evasion. 
If struggling countries get money too easily, there is not really any pressure for them to reform. This was a big problem in Greece, for example.  

As for Germany, the majority of the population was against the introduction of the Euro because back then the German Mark was pretty much the only national symbol of pride. In the end the population agreed to the Euro only because they were promised that the Euro would be as stable as the German Mark and that they would not have to pay for other countries' financial mismanagement. So if you would like to change this setting you need strong points to convince the people. (Including the people in the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Finland and Austria.) 

I am all for uniting Europe more, also on the budget level. But whatever the solution in this case will be, it will not be a solution that will allow countries with internal problems to evade addressing their problems by easily getting money from other countries, and it will be a solution that will come with a severe loss of national sovereignty. Not even Macron is willing to go this far.",Berlin,/r/europe/comments/8o7xoc/solidarity_with_euro_zone_does_not_mean_sharing/e01yg8w/,nibbler666,1528053827

""ncidents of anti-Jewish violence continued through the 1950s, although French officials later stated that Moroccan Jews ""had suffered comparatively fewer troubles than the wider European population"" during the struggle for independence.[52] In August 1953, riots broke out in the city of Oujda and resulted in the death of 4 Jews including an 11-year-old girl.[53] In the same month French security forces prevented a mob from breaking into the Jewish Mellah of Rabat.[53] In 1954, a nationalist event in the town of Petitjean (known today as Sidi Kacem) turned into an anti-Jewish riot and resulted in the death of 6 Jewish merchants from Marrakesh.[54] However, according to Francis Lacoste, French Resident-General in Morocco, ""the ethnicity of the Petitjean victims was coincidental, terrorism rarely targeted Jews, and fears about their future were unwarranted.""[55] In 1955, a mob broke into the Jewish Mellah in Mazagan (known today as El Jadida) and caused its 1700 Jewish residents to flee to the European quarters of the city. The houses of some 200 Jews were too badly damaged during the riots for them to return.[56] In 1954, Mossad had established an undercover base in Morocco, sending agents and emissaries within a year to appraise the situation and organize continuous emigration.[57] The operations were composed of five branches: self-defence, information and intelligence, illegal immigration, establishing contact, and public relations.[58] Mossad chief Isser Harel visited the country in 1959 and 1960, reorganized the operations, and created a clandestine militia named the ""Misgeret"" (""framework"").[59]

5415,"Yes, you could theoretically have a general election and cancel Brexit.

However, it has also become an difficult path from a political sense, I think.

I'd argue that for this to be politically realistic, it would need to involve a second referendum, since I have a profoundly hard time seeing a Parliament willing to cancel referendum results that it had stated it would act on.

The Liberal Democrats ran on a second referendum platform in the last GE and didn't really get anywhere.

Additionally, while support for Remain-Leave was near even and could conceivably-to-me be tipped, support for a second referendum is considerably weaker.  /r/ukpolitics, a while back, had results up from polling approval among Britons for different rewordings of this ""should there be a second referendum"" question, and none of them saw majority support for a referendum that would produce a cancellation.  Basically, supporting Remain is not equivalent to supporting rerunning the referendum.  I don't know, maybe support on this easier to shift than on Remain-Leave (which has been fairly constant), as it's a question that people haven't formed an opinion on over decades, but what I've seen thus far hasn't looked promising.  Though based on that polling, there are clearly people looking into practical ways to achieve it, so that's positive.

So, to do this, here's what I assume needs to be done:

* I don't believe that either Big Two party is currently running on a second referendum platform.  So one of them needs to adopt that position, unless you plan to have LD somehow massively improve their ability to get single-issue Brcancel voters from the last time they tried this.

* Public opinion needs to be swung to Remain.

* A second referendum has to be run.  Note that this interacts with the Brexit talks, since it creates a misincentive for the EU to offer an unfavorable arrangement if it knows during negotiations that there will be a referendum.

* An extension on Brexit may be required for the referendum to have time to happen under those time constraints.  That requires all 27 EU members to agree, but I recall that Juncker explicitly stated that the EU would do this (and I assume that the EU would ultimately agree to it if it thought that the UK would realistically stay in and that's what this is for).  Though it'd create misincentives for the EU down the line — the EU does not want Le Pens or Tsiprases playing chicken with A50 by triggering A50 and making demands to get them to cancel.

    If the UK just plans to rejoin after leaving, then the extension isn't required, but I'm not at all sure that the UK would get the opt-outs in that case — that seems like newer members who weren't permitted them and really wanted then might strenuously object.  I assume that this would reduce British support for EU membership.  Also, there are some cliffs that happen — the ability to do trade in services with the EU likely gets cut off.  You can't just keep a services company running if it cannot do business with the EU and is geared up for it.  It needs to start layoffs of staff that it doesn't need.  So the UK would have to ""disalign"" its economy from the EU, and then ""realign"".

* The SNP will presumably use a second referendum to argue that this ""once a generation"" stuff on independence referendums is bunk and the SNP wants one for Scotland too.  I suppose that London can just tell the SNP ""no"", but it sure doesn't make things more appealing for London.

* There is already ""Brexit"" business changes happening even prior to Brexit, so that has to be backed out.

* The EU today is as maximally-aligned to the British ideal as it can get, given the extent of British influence.  There are already changes happening in the EU that shift it away from that, reflecting the new set of influences, like the PESCO stuff.  So the EU that a second referendum or a rejoin referendum will be on will be a less-desireable-for-Britain place.  I don't know what the Remain/Leave impact will be, but it probably won't help.

Are these surmountable?  Sure, but I don't see an easy way around anything but maybe getting the EU-27 to provide an extension.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/8o0r4t/ireland_gives_britain_two_weeks_to_produce_brexit/e01razg/,vokegaf,1528046332

5459,"There was a comment here earlier about the council proposing legislation. The way I learned, it’s the commission that proposes legislation, which is voted on by the parliament, and the council accepts the final bill.

This makes the council, a full executive body, the commission is semi-executive and semi-legislative (although also the most important legislative body), and the European Parliament a legislative body though it is still without the power of legislative initiative.

But the council is composed of heads of states. That would be like our senate being composed of the governors of the 50 states. Traditionally, in an executive body, the representatives are elected specifically for that role if they are the head, this prevents conflict of interests between state and federal politics, because policy on the state level is different from on the federal level, and a voter may want a Merkel centrist for German politics, but wants an integrationist politician at the federal level. It keeps the politics from mixing.

Also, the commission isn’t elected either. They are appointed by the states. So two levels of politics separate the people from the federal decision making. The US sort of had that in our first century. Our senate was composed of senators appointed by the state governments, but we decided it was not democratic, and the political deals and corruption were overriding the will of the people, so we amended the constitution to require open elections of senators.

Both bodies of legislature should be made of democratically elected representative specifically for that role. The European Parliament, and the commission should have equal power to draft laws, and then they should debate amongst themselves as in any bicameral system. 

The commission acts as the executive/main legislature for the federal government, so it’s basically the US president (if the president also controlled the senate), except instead of being one person it’s more of a directorate. That definitely has advantages, but could possibly make the branch less efficient and prone to internal political discourse. Either way, I would want the US president to be directly elected (which means I support amending the process in the constitution that favors the elector college over the popular vote), so I would like the EU to operate the same way.

Yes, but the taxation in the first place will depress the economy. When you deprive the citizens of a part of their income. The only way taxation could boost the economy is if you think taxation 1) has no negative impact on peoples willingness to work; 2) will not propel people to try to avoid taxation; 3) the state is better at investing money than the private citizens.

5469,"Farmers don’t have employers. They are their own employer. When the price of corn goes up, my family makes more money by selling corn. It’s common sense.

Farmer workers who don’t own their own farm get paid more only in the sense that their work is more valuable and there is a higher demand for farm work as prices go up. That also increases wage pressure. 


You make it sound like the standard of living in agricultural economies is independent of the value of their agriculture. It’s fully dependent on the value of the agriculture. And their agriculture is more valuable if they can sell it to more customers.

5474,"Edit: Most crimes of passion, and most crimes related to sex come from people you know. Your boss, your employee, your sister, your cousin, your uncle. So when someone dies unexpectedly, they start with the most obvious suspects first. Generally killing strangers isn't a thing, and generally those people are called serial killers; because they actively hunt for their prey(They are predators after all). 

So rule number one to getting away with a crime like this is preventing them from figuring out who the victim is in the first place. It is sad for the victim, but true, if they can't figure out who you are, they can't really figure out who in your circle of acquaintances to target. That's why there are a ton of cold cases out there. 

Either someone randomly decided to kill you which is rare, in which case they talk to everyone you knew, and no one seemed like the right fit, or the person knew what they were doing, and did everything in their power from preventing law enforcement from figuring out who it is the person was. 

End edit.

I mean while I think what you are saying is true, not everyone geographically has access to a boat to dump the body with the fishes. 

Second best bet? A really deep water hole. Not only does water (especially salt water which this probably isn't the case) degrade the body, removing any fluids/fingerprints that may have been left behind, but also makes identification more difficult. Pro tip if you remove the teeth, any medical devices (breast implants, pace makers, metal rods), and the fingers/toes. (preferably after said person is dead, crime of passion is one thing, torture...not so much).

I wouldn't recommend killing anyone, nor disposing of their body, but I've watched around 18 seasons of Law and Order Special Victims Unit. I know its just a show, and I know that a real courtroom doesn't behave that way, but it's still entertaining.

5551,"If I may offer some corrections...

&gt; The commission created the first draft of the legislation which was very mild and a decent step in the right direction

Not at all. Commissioner Oettinger came up with the upload filters (Article 13) and link tax (Article 11) despite loud protests from Parliament (e.g. https://juliareda.eu/2015/12/ancillary-copyright-open-letter/ warning of a link tax). Here's what's in the Commission proposal: https://juliareda.eu/2016/12/10-illegal-things/

Who's to blame for this is not one specific branch of the EU, but  Conservatives representing big corporate special interests in all three of them, mostly German CDU members (Commissioner Oettinger and MEP Axel Voss).

&gt; No country said it's too extreme

These countries voted against the Council position:

* Finland, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Belgium because it's too extreme
* Germany and Hungary because Article 11 (the ""link tax"") was not extreme enough for them

&gt; (Vote counts)

First you need to count the votes in the Legal Affairs Committee, not the plenary as a whole. This is where the vote on June 20 will be.

The EPP, ECR, ALDE and ENF negotiators there are in favor of Article 13. Together, they have a 13 over 12 vote majority. And it's not guaranteed that all of S&amp;D will be unified against.

So our job is to convince one of these MEPs. Here are some candidates that may be swayed:

* MEP Marinho e Pinto (ALDE, PT, PDR)
* MEP Angel Dzhambazki (ECR, BG, VMRO)
* MEP Sajjad Karim (ECR, UK, Conservatives) 
* MEP Marie-Christine Boutonnet (ENF, FR, Front National)
* MEP Gilles Lebreton (ENF, FR, Front National)
* MEP Mary Honeyball (S&amp;D, UK, Labour) – very pro copyright
* Whoever is your local ALDE MEP, asking them to put pressure on Marinho e Pinto, who will vote ""in their name""

They're not using term modern art to refer to the contemporary post-modern art.

Oh please, go and read what he says in the other comments and what he was trying to refer to, and what he was giving as examples.

Random shapes and colours can also mean cubism or Russian avant-garde or expressionism by the way, but it wasn't even what he was referring to, while if you're calling those thrash, I'd say meh and move on anyway.

I don't think excepted cases are difficult to spot at all, and largely pivots on the proportion of an original work a derivation possesses. You can get a long way in this case with just a dice coefficient. I don't believe from personal experience it's anyway near as hard as you suggest to preserve exceptions and limitations.

The EU's example of who it is they are trying to protect is music artists having their albums made available on YouTube, or authors on Scribd. So we have that on one side as a clear use case... Can you point me at a concrete example of the type of content you think is at risk? Not in general terms, point me at a piece of example content, that you feel likely to run afoul of filters.

In asking you for a concrete example, I realise I'm asking for more than a casual comment in a random conversation. If you can't be arsed, I think that's quite reasonable, and I'll not infer anything from it other than you've better things to do with your weekend. It's just I think the case examples on the EU side are quite clear, and I'm hearing nothing but generalisation on the other, I'd like to make more concrete.

I get your point about content aggregators being motivated toward pulling down weak matches, but avoiding lawsuit is not their only motivation. They are also motivated to provide content their users provide. Further the regulations require that they be accountable and be able to demonstrate diligence, not that they are perfect.

Why am I motivated to take this position? I find it bizarre the number of people that feel the need to argue the interests of large content aggregators over the interests over the rights of content creators. Large rights holders can protect those rights. Small rights holders can't. Content aggregators who have a model to pay rights holders, end up at a competitive disadvantage over those who don't, and I'm uncomfortable normalising the exploitation of content creators for the benefit of 800lb gorillas.",,/r/europe/comments/8nqyvo/article_13_will_be_passed_on_the_20th_of_june_we/e01bq2l/,Carnagh,1528024913

5737,"Her party ran on an anti-vaccine and ""vaccines cause autism"" platform and the interior minister isn't any better:

&gt;The more extreme position on vaccines is held by the League, a far-right party set to play a key role in any center-right coalition that emerges after the March 4 vote. The party is entirely opposed to the law. The party’s leader Matteo Salvini argues mandatory vaccinations incurs on Italians’ “freedom of choice,” saying in a recent interview that “having twelve [shots] together exposes the children [to] risk” and the jabs should be at the discretion of “of mum and dad.”

According to medical historians this ""anti-mandatory vaccine"" position is being used a precursor to get rid of vaccines completely:

&gt;That’s a first step toward getting rid of the vaccine completely, says medical historian Grignolio. “It is an intelligent strategy. If you say you are against [it], then [revoke] compulsory vaccinations, what you are offering is a route for citizens to avoid vaccinations.” Comilva, one of the country’s largest anti-vaccination bodies has endorsed the League. In an email to TIME, Claudio Simion, president of Comilva, said 5SM’s leadership has betrayed “the will of the base,” but added approvingly that there are still “members of the party who continue to support our struggle for freedom of choice and transparency.”

Exactly.  The current state of affaris has worked very well.  It keeps the situation in check by keeping communities happy enough.  If you disrupt that, it could escalate depending on how unhappy people are with the outcome.

&gt; As soon as those guys tried to place an order for fertiliser and fuze components or had a WhatsApp chat about rekindling their our habits they’d have the police and army counter-terrorism units kicking their doors in. 

This is a bizarre statement. OTOH you're boasting about the pervasiveness of surveillance, and on the other you display precisely the kind of mixture of complacency and arrogance that inevitably leads to disaster.  

Close surveillance is not enough - it certainly wasn't even when means of communication were easier to tap.

&gt; my point was that if the UK couldn’t stop things crossing the border with 27,000 soldiers policing it

I think you misunderstand the problem of the border.  Sure, contraband is an issue, and if the border is too porous (e.g. no checks), it would almost certainly breach international law.  

The problem would be with checks on legitimate business that are being imposed on the Catholic community even though they are overwhelmingly against it. 

&gt; even if the EU tried to force the U.K. or ROI

1. It's a WTO requirement too. It would open up the UK to retaliatory tariffs from anyone.  

2. The EU couldn't force the UK to put up a border - international law would.

&gt; ...because it’s just too difficult.

That's not an excuse for failing to comply with the law(!)

You mention military, etc.  I'm not sure you understand what a hard border is.  If you have a customs office on the border staffed by very polite people checking trucks, with not even a single police office in sight, then that is still a (very) hard border.

&gt;* To any Italian redditors reading how would you describe your average Italian person?

It doesn't exist, we change a lot pending age,city,class...

&gt;* When it comes to alcohol Italy is wine centric, but as an Italian have you ever tried and do you like cider and ale? Do you like it or not?.. And can you buy cider and ale in Italy?..

We drink less wine that you probably think, young drink more often beer than wine and cider is not unheard of but is a niche product.

&gt;* What does takeaway/takeout food in Italy consist of, what's it like??..

From pizza/pasta , to Indian, to kebab, Argentinean...


&gt;*  Well what do you Italians think about it?, do any of you feel the same way??..

It doesn't have a particular feel for us it's just the norm.

&gt;* What do you think of the sport of Rugby?, Is Rugby popular in Italy?

Used to be really disrespected it was seen as a sport for people with more muscle than brain. The 6 nation made it seen as a noble sport but is not mainstream yet.


&gt;* How much obesity is there in Italy?. How many fat people do you see everyday?

Relatively uncommon. Few enough to notice them.

&gt;* How popular or not is gym culture in Italy?, cuz in the uk we have a lot of young men who spend ages in the gym to get that muscular body

We have plenty of gyms but it's usually not an obsession .


&gt;* Is Italy a individualist or community orientated country?

Depends by the context


&gt;* Do you like curry or not and why?, What do you think of it?, Is curry popular in Italy??.


Rice with curry chicken is so popular that even the most traditional trattorie have started having it on the menu. Why? We like the taste

&gt;* Is anime a thing in Italy?

Definitely. Especially since the 90s generation grew up with Japanese cartoons.


&gt;* What would you say are the main differences between Italian people and British people??. And on a cultral &amp; societal level what are the differences between Italy and Britain??.. And vice versa what are the similarities(if there are any?) between Italiand/Italy and Brits/Britain?..

The British tend to respect rules more than us when they are sober and a lot less when the are drunk. In general British people tend to have a way worse relationship with alcohol. British people are very emotionally repressed imo and have a wider concept of personal space. And young  Brits tend to be way more sensitive and arguably soft skinned in comparison to their Italian counterpart.

Those of course are generalisations :)


&gt;* In Italy are Brits considered to attractive/hot/sexy??.

Women no. Men if they can live up to the gentleman stereotype have an advantage yes.

&gt;* Are most Italians pro or anti British?

We have not much of a strong opinion either way. But we like you more than the Germans and the French that is enough?


&gt;* I just wanna know what's the ordinary Italian person's opinion of the Italy's past, present and above all future?. Where do they see Italy's and humanity going in future?.

For the past depends a lot from the time, present is seen as messy and the future scary.

&gt;* Do you notice your own Italian accent when speaking English?, what do you think of it?, are you like embarrassed or not?. And do you find it annoying when so many ppl try to imitate/mock your accent?.

Sometimes. I find it cringy and try to hide it. I believe they are idiots. 

&gt;* What does the Italian school cirriculum consist of?. What do you learn about?..

Depends a lot from age and when it comes to high school of the type of high school.


&gt;* I am also curious on how much do Italian students learn about Britain? Do you learn about the Celts, Romans, Saxons, British Empire, Industrial Revolution, The Middle Ages etc? and are basics beyond trading and wars covered, or do go more in-depth or is it just those two main topics?. Just what do you learn about the UK?... I was also wondering how do you view the UK and British people(and culture too)?, Do you like Brits?..

Well from memory: Caesar, the Adrian wall, Elizabeth I, American revolution very briefly, the East India company, Napoleonic wars, industrial revolution, Victoria, the western front in ww1, Ireland independence, Churchill, Ghandi.

In history depends of the period since our history programs are focused on Italy and the surrounding.So the more you impacted here the more you get covered. In English class we tend to go a bit deeper . For the UK mostly ghografical facts . 

Aside the usual XIX c. Stereotypes we tend to conflate your culture with American one. 

Yes we generally like you as long you are not behaving like  annoying drunk



&gt;* When it comes to things like sex and porn are you prudish, awkward and puritanical, is it a big taboo to openly discuss such matters, like do Italian ppl like to pretend it doesnt exist? etc... Well my question is what's it like in Italy?. Are you like that or are you much more open about sex and porn?.. 

The reason why I believe people think we are prudish is that they rarely have the capacity to understand us when at the bar or coffee machine.

&gt;* What's Italy's view of sex and porn?..

Part of life.

&gt;* Is Feminism a thing in Italy?, And if feminism is a thing is it out of control like in other parts of Western Europe?...

Sort of. If you mean Tumblr feminism ? No. Well not even Tumblr is particularly a thing.


&gt;* Are most Italian men uncut or not?..

Circumcision is jew/Muslim thing here. Like all of Europe I think.


&gt;* What is the LGBT situation like in Italy?, do they have rights?, Is LGBT and being gay accepted socially and cultrally??. Just whats it like being gay or trans in Italy?..

Complex. We have civil partnership and anti discrimination laws. Depends a lot of were you live the bigger less rural the place is the more it is accepted.


&gt;* What types of music are popular in Italy?. 

Rap, pop, rock. 

&gt;* What do you Italian guys &amp; girls listen too?..

Depends from age/personal taste. You can find easily our top 50 chart on the internet.

&gt;* What are race relations like in Italy?..

Limited due to recent emigration and using the term race in a context that is not dog breeds will make people look down of you due to fascism.

&gt;* What are foreigner relations like in Italy??..

Depends of the country.


&gt;* What are the police like?.. how good(or not) are the Italian police?..

Carabinieri are usually chill. Polizia is more harsh (nothing in comparison to the us tho). 

&gt;* What are Italian unis like?.. how good(or not) are Italian Universities?..

Depends from the University. But in general they tend to be good but with a stronger preference to theory over practice. 


&gt;* What is the Italian school system like?... How good(or not) is the Italian school system?..

Depends from the region. The more north you go the better it is. It's improving but needs more founds.

&gt;* What is the healthcare system like?... How good(or not) is the Italian healthcare system?..

Very good. Italians are found of it and the WHO classified it second worldwide. But the quality varies from the region in the usual way.

&gt;The Washington Post reported that in 1984 the CIA secretly started providing intelligence to the Iraqi army during the Iran-Iraq War. This included information to target chemical weapons strikes. The same year it was confirmed beyond doubt by European doctors and UN expert missions that Iraq was employing chemical weapons against the Iranians.[36] Most of these occurred during the Iran–Iraq War, but chemical weapons were used at least once against the Shia popular uprising in southern Iraq in 1991.[18] Chemical weapons were used extensively, with post-war Iranian estimates stating that more than 100,000 Iranians were affected Saddam Hussein's chemical weapons during the eight-year war with Iraq,[37] Iran today is the world's second-most afflicted country by weapons of mass destruction, only after Japan.[citation needed] The official estimate does not include the civilian population contaminated in bordering towns or the children and relatives of veterans, many of whom have developed blood, lung and skin complications, according to the Organization for Veterans. Nerve gas agents killed about 20,000 Iranian soldiers immediately, according to official reports. Of the 90,000 survivors, some 5,000 seek medical treatment regularly and about 1,000 are still hospitalized with severe, chronic conditions.[citation needed]Many others were hit by mustard gas. Despite the removal of Saddam Hussein and his administration by American forces, there is deep resentment and anger in Iran that it was Western nations that helped Iraq develop and direct its chemical weapons arsenal in the first place and that the world did nothing to punish Iraq for its use of chemical weapons throughout the war.[citation needed] For example, the United States and the UK blocked condemnation of Iraq's known chemical weapons attacks at the UN Security Council. No resolution was passed during the war that specifically criticized Iraq's use of chemical weapons, despite the wishes of the majority to condemn this use. On March 21, 1986 the United Nation Security Council recognized that ""chemical weapons on many occasions have been used by Iraqi forces against Iranian forces""; this statement was opposed by the United States, the sole country to vote against it in the Security Council (the UK abstained).[38]",Moscow,/r/europe/comments/8o3krl/intel_report_iran_seeks_weapons_of_mass/e018up0/,notreallytbhdesu,1528017958

5875,"Well, let's go down your list:

&gt; My Irishness lets me understand the thing in a way that your Americanness does not.

Right, I'm going to skip over that one.

&gt;It's a long-running dispute.

Nothing I wrote depends on this.

&gt; The territory is not British.

It is British.  Once it was not, and there is some desire from some in changing that status, but there's an unambiguous legal status today.

&gt; There will be violence.

Threatening whom, exactly?  London has said (and I'd believe truthfully, if disingenuously) that it's comfortable not enforcing the border, but can't make the EU do the same.  Are you going to set off bombs in London until the UK concedes to remain in the customs union?  That'd be pretty politically difficult to sell, given that the core issue was that Irish were required to remain in political union by force.

Attack the checkpoint guards?  They'll be Republic of Ireland citizens.  *They* didn't advocate for this.

Threatening the RoI government that will put up the customs checkpoints?  To what end?  They don't *want* customs checkpoints.  They will simply prefer having them to leaving the EU Customs Union and entering a customs union with the UK.  And I hardly think that an ardent Irish Republican is going to advocate for such an arrangement.

Threatening Brussels?  They won't say ""give up on NI"".  They're just going to say ""if you want to be in our club, you have to play by the minimum rules, and that means a customs border at the outside of the customs union.""  That is no arbitrary rule — it's required for the customs union to function.  They aren't being unreasonable.

I don't believe that this is a situation where there's a convenient person to threaten with violence who will change things.

&gt; Trade reduction will make people upset and produce job losses.

I expect that it will, to some degree.  Will happen in the UK and will happen in other EU members as well.  Will suck for a number of people.  However, I don't believe that that in any way is unexpected or that that it would be considered to be a realistic impediment to the UK leaving beyond having a shot at causing Remain to win in the Brexit referendum.

Note that at least on the specific question of tariffs, it's possible (unless blocked for one reason or another) that there will be a UK-EU FTA.  Additionally, even without it, the UK *can* lower its tariff schedule if it chooses — it just won't give RoI farmers a special status relative to the rest of the world in that case.  There have been at least a handful of articles proposing unilaterally zeroing British tariffs.  While I doubt that that will happen, I can imagine British agricultural tariffs dropping, as high tariffs would have been favorable to net agricultural exporters internal to the EU — which the UK is not one of, and so I suspect that if anything, the post-Brexit agricultural tariffs will be lower than the per-Brexit.  The only thing I've read on the matter was a year-old document from a British farming lobby, though, and while it obviously wanted high tariffs, it was looking with some trepidation about the prospect of them falling.

&gt; The Brits don't care about Northern Ireland

They've spent quite some decades keeping it.

&gt; Brussels isn't going to throw a member under the bus

Brussels not starting a territorial fight is hardly ""throwing a member under the bus"" — Ireland received no guarantees from the EU that the EU in aggregate would go fight the UK for Northern Ireland.

""Ah, but you don't *know* that the EU won't do so, now do you?""

Sure, Brussels could abruptly announce that the EU will jump into that territorial fight, threaten the UK with all sorts of horrbile things if it doesn't turn over Northern Ireland.  But it hasn't happened so far, and Brussels doesn't gain anything by just sitting on its *real* position.  On the contrary — if that's a true red line, the EU wants the UK to know that it is a red line.

What Brussels and London have done is to come out with proposals that they know will not be accepted by the other side and then publicly insist that the other side produce a workable solution.  That makes sense if both do not expect any solution to be reached and each just has the aim of presenting the other side as being the bad guy forcing the border.  It makes no sense if the EU *actually* has a hard-line position and intends to slug it out with the UK to force a real, viable Brexit deal that involves control of NI's economy going to the EU.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/8o0r4t/ireland_gives_britain_two_weeks_to_produce_brexit/e018z1s/,vokegaf,1528018268

If I say my jacket is a spiritual choice, it doesn’t make it so. You yourself admitted earlier that it is a cultural cloth. It is not religious, or spiritual nor required by Islam as evidenced by the women in many moderate islamic countries.

&gt;	But they believe it's recommended. That it ""brings them closer to God"" (this is an argument frequently appearing in interviews itc.).

Again they are told amd taught by their families and local Muslim community. It’s cultural, these communities want to control “their” women. They were raised to believe it. Its only going to get worse the more conservative muslim communities become.

&gt;	Which is not how it most often works. Read linked research, majority of these women (again, in Europe/NA) are from families where mothers don't wear it, or sometimes even don't wear hijab; or even converts.

This is not true. Your research is only 32 women in France and a seperate study of 122 women in Britain. This is not enough data to state that the **majority** of these women come from families whose mothers dont wear it. In fact 154 women is so miniscule it barely shows anything at all except perhaps to try to push a narrative that isnt real. 

You know there were over 3 million muslim migrants to europe alone in just one year. 26 million in total in 2016. So please excuse me if i dont believe a study of 154 women is representative of anything.

Converts want to fit in with the social pressure that comes from marrying into a conservative Muslim family. They are appeasing their views.

While the Swedes were very unwise to not have any faith in the Norwegians to invest into the new Norwegian oil industry.

There's a 1960s Swedish talk show that invited a Norwegian and it really shows the great contrast back then to now, and he talks about how how depressing and poor it is in Norway, and the Swedish host is like more like poking fun of him ""oh those poor Norwegians!"". Norway had nothing, barely any industries or significant resources compared to Sweden. Same with Iceland, which used to be one of the poorest nations in Europe as well.

&gt;As part of Project 922, German firms helped build Iraqi chemical weapons facilities such as laboratories, bunkers, an administrative building, and first production buildings in the early 1980s under the cover of a pesticide plant. Other German firms sent 1,027 tons of precursors of mustard gas, sarin, tabun, and tear gasses in all. This work allowed Iraq to produce 150 tons of mustard agent and 60 tons of Tabun in 1983 and 1984 respectively, continuing throughout the decade. **All told, 52% of Iraq's international chemical weapon equipment was of German origin.**
