I think, and I’m not sure, that Greece wants each subject to be its own treaty. Thus, in the future, turkey will not use that one treaty to contest fifty topics at once. To explain, let’s say EEZ and militarization is one topic: fifty years from now turkey contests the treaty under the assumption of the militarization, and since the treaty doesn’t hold (as per a hypothetical Turkish objection), they claim EEZ again since that one treaty doesn’t hold anymore.

This ""strike"" won't last. Think about it logically. People need to work for money, and to use that money to support themselves, their loved ones, and so on. Do you really think for a second that hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people are going to risk their livelihoods and jobs for an opposition that has zero chance of overthrowing the government? These protests have been going on for 2 months now. Two months of the opposition achieving nothing. So do you really think people will be willing to give up their work and their livelihoods for a motion that has gained zero ground in two months of straight protest? I think not. 

And where were you during this, Mrs. Opposition? Hiding out in Lithuania was it? I have no respect for a leader who runs from her supporters and leaves them to do the dirty work in the streets of Belarus. If you want change, stand with your people in Belarus. Hiding out in Lithuania whilst your supporters are beaten, arrested and tortured is a display of cowardice. If you are concerned for your children, fine. I am sure the Lithuanian government would be more than happy to take care of them in the meantime, but if you are wanting to lead such a grand motion against Lukashenko, stand with your people. 

This motion will collapse in on itself. Lukashenko is too powerful a leader, and has too much support from Armed Forces and Police (as well as Russia) whilst the opposition has achieved nothing and has a coward as a leader. The October 26th strike won't happen.

&gt;The total population of Persia may have dropped from 2,500,000 to 250,000 as a result of mass extermination and famine.

&gt;About half the population of Kievan Rus'(Russia) may have died during the Mongol invasion of Rus

&gt;Before the Mongol invasion, Chinese dynasties reportedly had approximately 120 million inhabitants; after the conquest had been completed in 1279, the 1300 census reported roughly 60 million people.

&gt;These estimations add up to approximately 65,475,000 people directly killed by the Mongol Empire.

160,"I'd like that.

But in all fairness China was a much bigger challenge for the Mongols than was Europe. First a Mongol ""expeditionary force"" beat the Armenian crusader army easily. Then a Mongol army proper beat the two massive European armies assembled to oppose them just as easily. After those defeats a Templar knight reported to the king of France that ""there is not an army to stop them between them and the atlantic ocean.

The only reason they didn't try to reach that ocean was that Genghis dies and everyone rushed back to be part of the process of selecting the new one.

Europe was saved from the steppe armies in much the same way as with the huns about a millenium before. They were also undefeated, but Attila accepted a payment for not sacking Rome and then died on his wedding night (thank you for exhausting him, young German princess!) and then the armies retreated.

In contrast the Mongol invasion of China started much earlier and ended much later (the European adventure was something they could do on the side) and was much harder.

Still, pushing back on Chinese insistence on determining on what other peoples can say and do is something I can support. Even if they can rightfully say ""Oh, yeah?

When the sources that were once reliable got unreliable people just go to some other place, social media is one of those places including Reddit.

Day by day and almost minute by minute the past was  brought up to date. In this way every predication made by the Party  could be shown by documentary evidence to have been correct; nor was any  item of news, or any expression of opinion, which conflicted with the  needs of the moment, ever allowed to remain on record. All history was a  palimpsest, scraped clean and reinscribed exactly as often as was  necessary. In no case would it have been possible, once the deed was  done, to prove that any falsification had taken place.

Secondly, Romanian culture doesn't have a particularly strong tradition of demonizing sexual desire. Love is actually celebrated in various ways (songs, poems, celebrations, events where young people of marrying age could meet and mix etc.)

385,"&gt;As far as I know there is a liberal youth, especially in the big cities. It is true that in rural areas the people are always quite backwards, mainly poor and conservative people, both of which russia doesnt lack, but that doesnt make it right. Did the germans in 1940 just not like jews? Did the americans in the 1800s just not like blacks?

And then what? If you remove the vile comparison with the Nazis? Gays are treated poorly in many countries around the world and even in the EU itself. Why do you single out only the Russian Federation?

&gt;They gave the crimea to ukraine as a gift to their ""brother state"" (which Ukraine was forced into by the warsaw pact just like poland and czechoslovakia were) and now that they dont have any power over them anymore they take it back with force. I understand that the whole crimean conflict is quite complicated and that large parts of the population there want to be russian again, but russias plan of action is just aggressive and violent.

You have just written some fantastic nonsense comparing the Ukrainian SSR to the Czech Republic or Poland. This shows the low level of awareness of Western people about the history and situation of Russia in Eastern Europe. No wonder you are so easily manipulated by xenophobic media and politicians.

Ukraine is one of the founding countries of the USSR. And was in the Warsaw Pact, as part of the USSR.

Crimea was taken from Russia by Khrushchev (a Ukrainian) in order to enlist the support of the Communist leaders of the Ukrainian SSR.

Russia did not take away Crimea, but provided a choice for the residents of Crimea. These are the residents of Crimea who fled Ukraine after the coup in Kiev, when corrupt officials and xenophobes came to power.

&gt;Russian trolls exist, just a few weeks ago a russian ""troll factory"" was discovered in germany (https://www.eureporter.co/google-news/2020/10/05/russian-troll-factory-discovered-in-germany/) polarising by sending fake essays to media outlets. There is also the election manipulation in both the US and europe and the suppression of the press (Nawalny as a present example and before you say that there is no proof, he was poisoned with a soviet made toxin that cant be mixed together by some hillbilly).

You gave a very bad example of a Troll factory. He was already here. There is no evidence or details in the article. And the ""victims"" of trolls are top managers of firms involved in Russian corruption.

Novichok poison was used by the mafia in Russia in the 90s to kill people. For them, it was synthesized by a chemist in a good but ordinary chemical laboratory. The formula of this poison and the production technology is known to NATO countries.

You repeat the xenophobic fabrications. Of course, there were criminals among the soldiers of the Soviet army, when they were caught, they were executed. But don't Focus on the fact that American soldiers have raped the whole of Western Europe.

402,"&gt;I instinctively called you kid in my last comment because you certainly have the intellect of a kid also representing your nickname perfectly.  
  
Funny, I thought you were very intelligent.  

&gt;No again not everything Turkey does is what Erdogan says half of the country is not being administered by his party.   
  
No? So according to your intellect, what does half of Turkey who aren't administered by him do [when he sells ISIS oil](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/russia-releases-proof-turkey-smuggling-isis-oil-over-its-border-a6757651.html), when on his orders, Turkey [recruits and retrains Isis fighters](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/russia-releases-proof-turkey-smuggling-isis-oil-over-its-border-a6757651.html) to lead its invasion of northern Syria, or when [Turkey carries out demographic engineering in northern Syria](https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2020/05/turkey-syria-population-transfers-tell-abyad-irk-kurds-arabs.html)? Does the half of Turkey who doesn't support him still support Turkey when Turkey (on his orders) [sheltered Islamists and jihadists who were involved in planning the kidnapping and murder of three Israeli teenagers in 2014](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/middle-east-watch/turkish-qatari-axis-challenges-washington-116251). Did they support it or are they even able to stop it?   
   
&gt;First of all 1940s Germany didn’t have multi-party system and the country was controlled by a central government and by a totalitarian leader. Therefore government and country were tied more than anything in Europe today more than Saudi Arabia or even China.   
    
He already blocks about 50% of the vote while the other 50% is divided among parties who will never get together - a Kurdish party who gets about 10% vote in elections, a nationalist party who will never form alliance with the Kurdish party, a couple of new parties and CHP whose vote historically linger between 23%-33%. And Erdogan controls everything from bureaucracy to police to thugs on the street. 

Having a multi-party system doesn't make Turkey a liberal democracy, Turkey never was a liberal democracy. Turkey today is much closer to Russia than European democracies. Russia has a multi-party system too but it's always Putin that wins the elections while his opponents get poisoned, kidnapped, killed or silenced some way.  
  
Turkey is not much different. Erdogan controls all the media except a couple here and there, and he can shut down any other media without notice, he controls all the courts, he's allied with all the nationalists from MHP to Perincek. Some opposition MPs are in prison while others are threatened with lawsuits. He sent thousands of people to prison on terrorism or treason charges and can continue doing so without answering anyone.  
   
For the past 10-15 years, I've seen delusional people who think they're too smart (like yourself) who think the election victory is right around the corner, that ""Erdo is gone the next election"" and they always end up crying foul like ""they steal the votes"" or ""our people are stupid"".  
  
Erdogan won't lose an election. Erdogan will leave his throne by death or after a war.  
  
Any of that other jibberish you said doesn't change the fact that supporting Turkey's policies today is the same as a German saying ""I don't support Hitler, I support Germany"" in the 1940s.  
  
He single-handedly transformed Turkey from a modern secular (still military ruled) state with the motto ""peace at home, peace at world"" to a warmongering state who's dubbed the next pakistan who employs jihadists to further its foreign policy goals.

419,"&gt; No people supporting Nazism didn’t got punished for war crimes. People who did war crimes got punished for war crimes very little percentage of them in fact so little it probably can’t account 1% of them because you can’t really pinpoint on people who did war crimes outside of people with relative authority. In 1933 Hitler won by 44% after that electoral system was rigged and any number will be a lie but considering the economic success of new Germany and victories in Poland and a France you will expect that number to be way higher it was probably going up and up all until 1944. As half of Germany was not prosecuted for war crimes I really wonder what does your statement here even means.
&gt; 
&gt; Small number of Germans helped Jews maybe that’s the reason why million of them died, most of the Jew hiding and escape stories come from occupied countries(most notable of them is the Netherlands) or allies of Nazi Germany(with Bulgaria being one of the steel ballers) not from Germany it again no. Remove the resistance by generals and overall people with authority there was no inside unrest in Germany cause by ethnically German civilians.

Also, I think I chose the wrong words.  
   
Not counting the millions of Germans who died during the war, Nazi collaborators were hunted down for years after WWII, actually they are still hunted down in many countries. Even Oscar Schindler was punished. Lots of Nazi collaborators were imprisoned or hanged.     
   
But the real punishment fell on German people who supported Germany and Hitler's dream of nationalism and national glory.   
   
When bombs fell indiscriminately all over Germany, millions died or gone missing. Once Germany was invaded or occupied, a lot of people were arrested, tortured, beaten, died in custody. Women were raped left and right both on east and west Germany. A lot of male population was dead, gone and younger generations were re-educated by the doctrine written by the United States in the West and Soviet Russia in the East. So today's West Germans are extreme liberals who punish any hint of nationalism as ""far right extremism"".  
  
What do you think will happen to Turkey if Erdogan drags Turkey to wars like that?  Take a good look at Iraq and Syria. Even sanctions is a punishment of people living in Turkey. 1 USD is about to surpass 8 liras, probably in the next 24 hours.

First of all 1940s Germany didn’t have multi-party system and the country was controlled by a central government and by a totalitarian leader. Therefore government and country were tied more than anything in Europe today more than Saudi Arabia or even China.

No people supporting Nazism didn’t got punished for war crimes. People who did war crimes got punished for war crimes very little percentage of them in fact so little it probably can’t account 1% of them because you can’t really pinpoint on people who did war crimes outside of people with relative authority. In 1933 Hitler won by 44% after that electoral system was rigged and any number will be a lie but considering the economic success of new Germany and victories in Poland and a France you will expect that number to be way higher it was probably going up and up all until 1944. As half of Germany was not prosecuted for war crimes I really wonder what does your statement here even means.

Small number of Germans helped Jews maybe that’s the reason why million of them died, most of the Jew hiding and escape stories come from occupied countries(most notable of them is the Netherlands) or allies of Nazi Germany(with Bulgaria being one of the steel ballers) not from Germany it again no. Remove the resistance by generals and overall people with authority there was no inside unrest in Germany cause by ethnically German civilians.

No again not everything Turkey does is what Erdogan says half of the country is not being administered by his party.

Sorry for only replying to this part, but I think this is where I have the most interesting response to give.  


From a pragmatic point of view, it is indeed the secularism that does cause the conflict. It is a set of laws that is supposed to allow for peaceful coexistence for a target population. The religiosity of parts of that population is a given, not a reaction to the secularist laws. Therefore, if the secularist laws lead to conflict, it is because they fail to address a situation that would have arisen with or without the law. Put differently, it's an inadequate law (in that situation). It is still a good law if it fixes more situations than it worsens, though, and I think that it does that, even though we only hear about it when it doesn't work.",Brittany (France),/r/europe/comments/j9y1c4/france_plans_punishment_for_virginity_tests/g8r8uh6/,Bravemount,1602640472

Here:  
  
&gt;Turkey is recruiting and retraining Isis fighters to lead its invasion of the Kurdish enclave of Afrin in northern Syria, according to an ex-Isis source.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Most of those who are fighting in Afrin against the YPG [People’s Protection Units] are Isis, though Turkey has trained them to change their assault tactics,” said Faraj, a former Isis fighter from north-east Syria who remains in close touch with the jihadi movement.   
&gt;  
&gt;In a phone interview with The Independent, he added: “Turkey at the beginning of its operation tried to delude people by saying that it is fighting Isis, but actually they are training Isis members and sending them to Afrin.”    
&gt;  
&gt; https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/turkey-isis-afrin-syria-kurds-free-syrian-army-jihadi-video-fighters-recruits-a8199166.html   
   
Turkey invaded Syria and starting changing Syria's demographics by forcing/killing Kurdish population from the Kurdish areas and resettling sunnis in those towns and villages.  
   
&gt;The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights learned from reliable sources that Turkey began the process of demographic change it seeks to bring about in the areas it has taken control of in the Syrian north, where informed sources confirmed that several residents in the Syrian north are being transferred to “Tal Abyad” city, which is under the control of the Turkish Forces and the factions loyal to them of the Turkish military “Peace Spring” operation, reliable sources said: “Turkish Forces begun transferring citizens who wish to move to Tal Abyad, where cars depart daily in the morning and in the evening after registering the names of those wishing to move, and they are transported from Jarabulus to the border with Turkey and then to Tal Abyad with their property and belongings, on the pretext that they are returning to their original areas via Turkey.”    
&gt;  
&gt;https://www.syriahr.com/en/148032/  
  
Also here:  
  
&gt;Turkey’s transfer of Syrian families to Tell Abyad from Afrin has reignited worries of demographic engineering in northern Syria.  
&gt;...   
&gt;Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan makes no secret of his intention to uproot Kurdish self-rule in northern Syria and change the demographic character of the region, often reiterating Ankara’s plan to move up to two million refugees to a safe zone that is planned to be set up in the Operation Peace Spring region in the northeast. Addressing the UN General Assembly last year, Erdogan said Turkey initially planned to transfer up to one million refugees to the area by constructing 140 villages and 10 towns in the region. The second phase of the plan involves extending the resettlements to the town of Deir ez-Zor, which lies on the critical M-4 highway linking the country’s east and west.   
&gt;  
&gt;https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2020/05/turkey-syria-population-transfers-tell-abyad-irk-kurds-arabs.html   
  
Also:  
  
&gt;But Mr Erdogan’s real objective, some experts on the Kurdish question say, is to overwhelm the de facto home rule Syrian Kurds have established in the quarter of Syria’s territory they control with US air support in the fight against Isis. The aim is to change the demography and dilute the Kurds with a big influx of Sunni Arabs. Turkish troops, armour and medics are massed on the border to press their president’s case.   
&gt;   
&gt;Mr Erdogan’s maximalist plan is not realistic. But, whatever its intentions, it mirrors the violent demographic re-engineering going on in the rest of Syria.    
&gt;https://www.ft.com/content/e40cb754-e456-11e9-b112-9624ec9edc59  
  
&gt;But most of the 3.6 million Syrians in Turkey are from Sunni Arab areas in western Syria, not the mainly Kurdish northeast. Moving huge numbers of refugees into an area hundreds of miles from their homes would involve a drastic demographic shift.  
&gt;  
&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-syria-security-turkey-refugees-graphi-idUSKBN1WN28J   
   
Together with Pakistan and Iran, Turkey is now one of the world's largest employer of jihadist terror groups:  
  
&gt;The use of Syrian Jihadists first came into the picture last year, when Erdoğan decided to launch an offensive into Kurdish-held Northeastern Syria. Turkey used Syrian Jihadists alongside its troops to commit some of the most horrifying human rights violations against Kurdish fighters, who have been instrumental in fighting the Islamic State (ISIS).  
&gt;  
&gt;It seems that Ankara was so engrossed by the successes of low-cost warfare through Syrian Jihadists that it decided to deploy them in all the wars that Turkey has waged. Therefore, in Libya too, Turkey is using hardened Syrian militants to support the Muslim Brotherhood regime against Haftar’s LNA forces despite a UN arms embargo on Libya.  
&gt;   
&gt;And now Turkey is using the same tactic in the Nagorno-Karabakh region where Azerbaijan and Armenia are currently engaged in hostilities. Azerbaijan is a Turkish ally, and Ankara has openly supported the Azerbaijani offensive against Armenia. But Turkey is, of course, not using its own military troops to back Azerbaijan. It is using the low-cost Syrian Jihadist proxies to back Azerbaijan on Turkey’s behalf.    
&gt;   
&gt;https://tfipost.com/2020/10/soldiers-for-sale-how-pakistan-and-turkey-are-leading-the-medieval-mercenary-culture-in-the-21st-century/   
   
They're even using Uighurs in their terror campaigns:  
  
&gt;Since 2013, thousands of Uighurs, a Turkic-speaking Muslim minority from western China, have traveled to Syria to train with the Uighur militant group Turkistan Islamic Party and fight alongside al-Qaida, playing key roles in several battles. Syrian President Bashar Assad’s troops are now clashing with Uighur fighters as the six-year conflict nears its endgame.  
&gt;  
&gt;https://apnews.com/article/79d6a427b26f4eeab226571956dd256e   
   
We're getting mad at China for its treatment of Uighurs but they might have a legitimate reason to worry about their orientation after all. Did you say terrorism?  
   
One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter and Turkey has no right to create terror inside Syria. Turkey is one of the main actors of Syrian civil war since its beginnings and Erdogan's Syrian policy is one of the main reasons Turkey and other countries have to host so many Syrians who had to flee their homes, not Assad.   
   
Stop buying every state propaganda. Or keep on buying but don't expect everybody else to fall in line with you. The world doesn't buy Turkey's party line that ""everybody are terrorists"".   
   
Turkey isn't innocently defending itself from blood-thirsty Kurds in Syria. In addition to Erdogan's and Turkey's expansionist plans, Erdogan is pushing a Muslim Brotherhood agenda in the region and Syria is part of his plans. He wants to install/re-create the Muslim Brotherhood affiliate in Syria by moving in sunni population who will be loyal to Turkey and his agenda along with jihadist groups to establish a Muslim Brotherhood affiliate. Turkey has been actively involved in Syrian civil war since its first day with Erdogan calling for a regime change and with Erdogan had tried to negotiate a peace deal with PKK while Turkey was still involved in Syrian Civil war.   
  
Syria was never about Pkk. It's the state party line. You can get away with anything in Turkey as long as you can blame it on pkk or feto.

As far as I know there is a liberal youth, especially in the big cities.

Did the germans in 1940 just not like jews? Did the americans in the 1800s just not like blacks?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Russia supports brave people fighting the Kiev regime for their freedom

They gave the crimea to ukraine as a gift to their ""brother state"" (which Ukraine was forced into by the warsaw pact just like poland and czechoslovakia were) and now that they dont have any power over them anymore they take it back with force. I understand that the whole crimean conflict is quite complicated and that large parts of the population there want to be russian again, but russias plan of action is just aggressive and violent.

Russian trolls exist, just a few weeks ago a russian ""troll factory"" was discovered in germany ([https://www.eureporter.co/google-news/2020/10/05/russian-troll-factory-discovered-in-germany/](https://www.eureporter.co/google-news/2020/10/05/russian-troll-factory-discovered-in-germany/)) polarising by sending fake essays to media outlets. There is also the election manipulation in both the US and europe and the suppression of the press (Nawalny as a present example and before you say that there is no proof, he was poisoned with a soviet made toxin that cant be mixed together by some hillbilly). There is also that time a year ago or so where putin tried to rewrite history and said that the red army didnt do anything wrong, like raping (not in a metaphorical sense) the entirety of eastern europe and invading poland together with nazi germany. Yeah of course it was purely out of defense.

Russia doesnt have any remarkable industry (except for weapons which kind of says a lot) and their soft power is connected to dictatorships that are slowly going down the drain, syria or turkey for example. Im not going to induldge on their arms agreements since the west does pretty much the same, but lets just say selling advanced weapon technology to China is going to come right back at them sooner or later, literally. Russia is a sinking star and trying to take down the west with them.

Alexander rejected the idea because it wouldn’t be great for the residents to live there and (as he claimed) mount athos was already too famous for being the site where the Persian fleet was sunk by a storm during the greco-Persian wars.

685,"Depends on what you mean by notice. If you mean ""could one tell the difference if both results were shown next to each other"", then yes, absolutely, there would be a very obvious difference. It wouldn't be subtle at all.

To answer another interpretation of your question, let's assume that the result was presented in a different way, not as a map. Imagine the flag in the center, with a ring of the average color around it (with some space between them, perhaps as a light grey background). If you used RGB for this, it would at the very least seem odd, and in many/most cases it would be apparent that it's simply wrong. 

Frankly, I can't tell you what the ""correct"" way of doing it would be. OP is on the right track by using a weighted approach, IMHO, so, I'd copy that, but then what? What's the ""average"" color of a weighted set?

It's tempting to simply take their center of mass in your (approximately uniform) color space of choice, but there are other valid approaches. As you may know, there are [different answers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_center) to the question what the ""center"" of an irregular shape is. But I'd argue that any ""center"" based approach would only yield a dissatisfying result anyway.

Here's why: Imagine the ""average"" between in intense red and an equally intense blue. You'd expect an equally intense magenta, but if you used a method that calculated their center in a cartesian representation of a color space, the magenta it would indeed give you would be less intense than the original colors -- the middle of the direct line between them would be closer to the center, which means less chromatic or less saturated. You could get around this effect by using an angle, hue, for the tone of the color, and treating chroma and brightness seperately. But now you're looking for an ""average"" angle, i.e., the average position *on* (not ""in"") a circle, which raises some questions as well.

Yes, you could simulate the mixing of lights, or of paint, but this hints to the problem with that: additive, or subtractive?

The point is, there is no single ""correct"" way to do it, but not using RGB would be a good start. It's just not meant to be used that way. RGB is a cube, whereas in color spaces that are based on perception, the gamut of visible colors is shaped like an irregular blob. When ""10 more red"" changes the color less than ""10 more green"" would do, you can't really do geometry in that space.

Edit: Maybe a good way to go about it would be to take the pixels, redistribute them randomly, and then use a blur filter, or resize it to just one pixel, and let the image software do its magick?",European Federation | Germany,/r/europe/comments/j9q1a1/the_actual_average_color_of_every_countrys_flag/g8q7vn3/,CountVonTroll,1602620919

I, too, don't consider wide fairings to be a noteworthy similarity.

&gt;Grid fins which were invented by USSR for their missiles and rockets

Most certainly! The USSR's contributions to rocketry were tremendous.

That said, this specific application and configuration of grid fins was pioneered and commercialized by a certain American private launch company with help from the US government.

&gt;And the only similarity left in the article is that it will be reused 10 times. Wow!!! Such similarity!!!

I think Amur is a promising concept, wish the best for Roscomos, and would love to have a nice chat about it, so I really wish the article were less accusatory in tone. I assume you can see its big-picture point in that Amur bears an undeniable resemblance to a certain other rocket, but, like you, I don't consider that a bad thing: there's no shame in learning from success!

Canada sells goods to the EU without having to share fishing waters or have the EU interfere in their internal affairs.

In fact there isn't a trade deal on earth that includes fishing waters or control over another country's internal affairs. Or defence.

I'm afraid the EU is struggling to come to terms with it's shrunken state and thinks that if it includes these things in the deal it will be as though the UK had never left.

740,"The European Union agreed Monday to impose targeted sanctions against Russian officials and entities allegedly involved in the poisoning of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny but officials insisted the move should not undercut Europe’s continued high-level contacts with President Vladimir Putin.

Foreign ministers meeting in Luxembourg backed a Franco-German proposal to impose a travel ban and asset freeze, although a final list must still be approved. Diplomats have said France and Germany last week put forward a list of between six to eight people and one entity as proposed sanctions targets.

Separately, the bloc agreed to impose a new round of sanctions on Belarus officials, including President Alexander Lukashenko, over the repression of protesters and what western capitals say was the fraudulent presidential elections of Aug. 9. Mr. Putin has backed Mr. Lukashenko.

European officials have said evidence that Mr. Navalny was poisoned with Novichok indicates that the attack was likely carried out by Russian state actors. The military-grade poison was developed in the former Soviet Union and then Russia, and the materials needed to produce the nerve agent are highly restricted.

“We have agreed to enact sanctions against individuals that we consider to be responsible for this violation of international law,” German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said after the meeting. “It is important that the European Union shows unity concerning such a serious crime.”



The Kremlin has denied having any role in harming Mr. Navalny but Western calls for a serious Russian investigation into the incident have gone unanswered. Russia has said it needs more evidence from Germany to open an investigation.


“They are introducing sanctions over an issue that has no legal basis, no evidence, or documentation,” Vladimir Jabarov, the deputy head of the Federation Council’s committee on international affairs, told Russian news agency Interfax. He said that Moscow would respond to the sanctions.

Mr. Navalny fell ill in late August while traveling in Russia and was taken to Berlin for treatment a few days later. He was discharged from the hospital in late September. Russia has disputed the findings of European laboratories that Mr. Navalny had been poisoned by Novichok.

The targeted EU sanctions are expected to be tied to chemical-weapons sanctions the bloc introduced two years ago. The EU has also imposed economic and individual sanctions against Russia over its interference in neighboring Ukraine.

Mr. Navalny’s spokeswoman Kira Yarmysh didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Mr. Navalny had previously said that if anyone wanted to create a list of officials and Russian state actors to sanction, they needn’t look any further than the investigations on his website, which for years has detailed allegations of corruption and excess within the Kremlin’s circle.


While Moscow’s ties with the U.S. have been under increasing strain in recent years, Russia has hoped to make limited inroads with individual European countries.

That policy has had some success, with serious rifts remaining among European capitals on Russia. While the poisoning of Mr. Navalny has renewed tensions with Germany, Berlin has steered clear of any sanctions on the Russian Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, a crucial energy link to Russia that has been criticized by the U.S., Poland, Ukraine and other allies.

French President Emmanuel Macron has unnerved Baltic leaders by his efforts to rebuild regular contacts with Mr. Putin while the departure of the U.K. from the EU has weakened the ranks of those looking to increase pressure on Moscow.

Speaking after the foreign ministers meeting, the EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said the bloc would maintain its selective engagement approach to the Kremlin, not least over foreign-policy challenges like the fighting over Nagorno-Karabakh and peace talks for Ukraine.

“We take sanctions for one specific and concrete event,” Mr. Borrell said. “The whole world cannot be reduced to this unhappy event of poisoning of Mr. Navalny.”

Since protests erupted in Belarus over the summer, EU leaders have also sought to avoid a Ukraine-like conflict with Russia over the former Soviet republic, even as they have called for Moscow to allow Belarus citizens to decide the country’s future.

Earlier this month, EU officials imposed an asset freeze on 40 Belarusian officials. The foreign ministers agreed to adopt a new sanctions package in coming weeks against Mr. Lukashenko and others involved in the crackdown on protesters and the presidential elections.






The U.S., Canada and the U.K. have all reinforced sanctions against Belarus in recent weeks. Mr. Lukashenko and 170 other Belarus officials were taken off an EU sanctions list in 2016 as the EU hoped to woo the country away from Russia’s influence.

The EU also said Monday it would shift its assistance to the country away from government institutions to civil society and the private sector while its investment arm, the European Investment Bank, would review its ties with Belarus.

As a result, a conspiracy was hatched within the 'local burgersocieties' \[comprised of the rich and influential citizens from The Hague\] and on the 20th of august 1673 a lynchmob ~~broke into the brothers' house~~  suprised them just outside their house and killed them.

Some parts were sold (like the genitals of one of the brothers) while some other body parts (probably the butt cheeks) were eaten.

Grey wolf is more of an national animal for us but nationalist mostly use it. Secondly yes, Turkey has right to self protect from Syrian groups. Here is UN charter 51 about it:

UN article 51: “Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security. Measures taken by Members in the exercise of this right of self-defence shall be immediately reported to the Security Council and shall not in any way affect the authority and responsibility of the Security Council under the present Charter to take at any time such action as it deems necessary in order to maintain or restore international peace and security.”

857,"&gt; You live in left lib fantasy land. Poles didn't do terrorism or turn whole cities into crime ridden ghettos.

Neither did the African. You seem to be, again, ignoring the past : we've imported African workers since WW2, they helped rebuild our country, we wouldn't be as rich today as we are if it weren't for them.

If you want to look at it from the negative side, then again, go back in history, learn about Italians bringing organized crime to France, learn about Spaniards in the 30s who were put in concentration camps because they were believed to be terrorists preparing a coup d'état. Learn about how we treated the Jews as well, how they never accepted our culture, learn about the Pope nearly driving us to war a century ago.

""Crime ridden ghettos"" as you call them... are places where a ton of poor people ended up. Not just African and not just Muslim but also people who come from Spain, from Italy, from Eastern Europe, from Asia.

&gt; Poles assimilated and many great things came from ethnic poles.

Like all foreigners do. African ones included. If, and only if, we let them live with us and we don't : when every week you tell a child that he never belonged here and never will, chances are, you're gonna get an adult that believes they don't belong, not because of their DNA, not because of their religion, but because of being pushed away. If you're gonna consider that this is ""refusing to integrate themselves"", then come to any construction site here in France and listen to the languages use, spoiler : Portuguese and Eastern European languages are extremely common, because you have a big foreign community that never learned the language.

&gt; Where's the Somali Marie Curie of France? 

Well, first of all there's not that many Marie Curies, second of all : born in the Russian Empire, of a noble father, professor of Math and Physics, and a mother who was a teacher, had secondary education (wasn't mandatory in France until 1959) then went to university (today, in France, only 3% of the children of poor people leave university with a diploma). Safe to say people from Somalia, a country where most children don't even go to school at all, aren't gonna go to a foreign university. Again : you're neglecting the social and economical aspects (comparing people dying of hunger with a women from a noble, very wealthy family) to support your story of Europeans' superiority. That is racism.

I come from a country that put in stone the idea that we're all born equal and that identity is built during life, not given at birth.

1021,"&gt;Britain did not abolish slavery in Spain or it's territories ever.

Britain ended the transatlantic slave trade, Spain didn't end of story. 

&gt;Spain abolished the slavery of it's citizens in 1505 by royal decree. That meant the natives and mixed race and Spanish could not be slaves.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asiento_de_Negros

&gt;Yes ironically this led to more black slavery as they were not Spanish. 

Exactly my point. 

&gt;However the British and Americans wouldn't catch up to even that basic level for hundreds of years

In the treaty of 1814, the king of Spain promised to consider means for abolishing the slave trade. In the treaty of September 23, 1817, with Great Britain, the Spanish Crown said that ""having never lost sight of a matter so interesting to him and being desirous of hastening the moment of its attainment, he has determined to co-operate with His Britannic Majesty in adopting the cause of humanity."" The king bound himself ""that the slave trade will be abolished in all the dominions of Spain, May 30, 1820, and that after that date it shall not be lawful for any subject of the crown of Spain to buy slaves or carry on the slave trade upon any part of the coast of Africa."" The date of final suppression was October 30. The subjects of the king of Spain were forbidden to carry slaves for any one outside the Spanish dominions, or to use the flag to cover such dealings.[³] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_colonial_Spanish_America#Ending_of_slavery)",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/j9nhpl/today_in_1492_columbus_arrived_to_the_new_world/g8p28ni/,DrPepperThanks,1602599893

And imho this is what happens here.

Russian politics simply cannot understand (or doesn't care) that a country like Germany always has measured approaches to almost anything.

Not even many European neighbours of Germany get that. Germany is simply not ""loud"" and it is certainly not very patriotic but that does not mean that you can simply carry on kicking butt and expect them to keep measured and calm again and again and again.

Hacking the Bundestag was a hostile act carried out by state agencies of Russia. (Accidently) hacking a german hospital which caused the death of a german citizen was undoubtly carried out from russian data centers and just as undoubtly could have prevented by russian state agencies if they had just cared.

And now Russian state agencies have (again) poisened a politician of the opposition and again Russia denies everything in the face of overwhelming evidence. Just like that.

And there is a time when you just can't go on any more. Nordstream 2 is finished, Russia - Germany relation are deeply damaged and Russia needs to be shown that they just can't carry on like this.

1066,"&gt; many were motivated by starvation they endured in their country. So if they hadn't left Europe, many of them would have died from it.

That's way too simplified. This applied to Ireland; in other parts of Europe, emigration was less about sheer survival and more about seeking jobs and opportunities to do business. E.g. some 100-200 thousand Czechoslovaks moved to the US in late 19th and early 20th centuries, and definitely not due to any kind of famine or intolerable conditions. In my own family, the emigrees were basically rather well-off peasants who just wanted more opportunities in life.

Add to that certain portions a year where meat is forbidden due to religious beliefs (not all people do the fasting, you usually commit beforehand and say that you will observe it this year). Even if you are not religious, your mother/wife/SO probably is and she doesn't cook meat anyway.

Did you actually witness it first hand, or is that just gossip and hearsay? I'm going to assume the latter, because as pointed out above, this has been illegal since 2016, and such outlets would consequently be breaking the law.

&gt;French secularism leads to conflicts pretty much every day.

Every policy, every guideline, every law, every rule creates conflicts.

The question is: for every conflict it creates, how many are warded off? Because that's what really matters in the end. The [1905 law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1905_French_law_on_the_Separation_of_the_Churches_and_the_State) establishing state secularism in France certainly didn't please everybody, but it brought an overall balance and globally put an end to the conflicts prevalent in France in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

1250,"That's the point of my last sentence. I don't think that Greco-Roman myth would have a higher density of named creatures than folk myths from Europe or the world in general, they just have received a privileged tradition and canonization due to the nature of western education and cultural roots (what about Etruscan myths, or Umbrian, Oscan, Sabellian, Italian Celtic...? I have books filled with myths and fairy-tales, all from small regions). Which shows in this map as well, and is one of its weakpoints. It's a list of classes of creatures that are in many cases not connected at all with the regions in which stories feature them. It's a case of using the wrong mode of presentation for what you want to show, unless it's just 'here are some of the common characters of various european mythologies and folk tales, and some places where some of them occur'.

1397,"&gt; Then again, who knows if you can trust East Asian governments. My friends who lived there say most government figures that paint the country in a bad light are airbrushed.

Lmao how very typically European. ""According to my friends who lived there"" is obviously credible source of information in the days of covid, apparently.

&gt; European countries are testing more than most places and have severe aging population, which partly accounts for our greater number of reported cases. 

Several East Asian countries are just as aged as European countries, if not more, and positive test rate (positive per tests performed) is extremely low in Taiwan and Korea. 

Frankly, I find it funny that so many Europeans are so confident about your ignorance. Like you said, you don't read the report at all, so you just naturally assumed that we must have done something fishy to make us look good. The arrogance oozes racism and white supremacy.

&gt; Also helps that East Asia is isolated from the rest of the world - a friend of mine wasn't even allowed back into China despite having a residence permit.

1399,"I get what you're saying, but there are several key reasons why I don't agree:

&gt; No need to interfere with each other's politics, for us the EU was supposed to be a free market not some politcal union. 

This isn't true. The Inner Six, of which you're a part of, a founder state, intended for the creation of a European federation as a result of their efforts. You're a founder of that vision. You knew exactly what you were signing and it wasn't a simple free trade area.

&gt; Transfering money from one region within your own country to another makes sense, we all contribute to the country's fund by paying taxes and vote in elections on how the money should be spent. I can't vote in any other EU country and therefore have no say on how their tax money is spent, so why should they get a share of our tax fund? 

And it makes sense in an ""ever closer union"", as per the TEU that you also signed (and helped write). It's a European value, not ""just business"". I don't know whether it's you that simply disregards what the EU is and what the EU treaties state or if this is the opinion of the majority in the Netherlands, but you need to understand the end result - a union that constantly integrates further and further until it's indistinguishable from a federation and then integrating even further. Currently, you're investing billions in the South and East (mostly East, Italy is a net contributor, for example) without representation. With a fiscal union, you will get that representation.  
 

&gt; You can pull the solidarity card , but on the end of the day it's business and not friendship so don't expect it to come from us. 

I'm sorry, but this is a core value enshrined in the TEU. It's not ""just business"". It's just business between the EU and Canada, not between coutnries inside the EU. Until you start seeing Europeans as ""us"" instead of ""them"", this conversation is pointless.

1420,"&gt;The Turkish Navy said on Sunday that the research ship Oruc Reis, at the center of an energy rights row with Greece, will be sent back to the sea area south of the Greek island of Kastellorizo.

&gt;Turkey withdrew the ship in September ahead of diplomatic attempts to resolve the dispute.

&gt;Now, Ankara has said that the ship will again spend 10 days conducting seismic research in the eastern Mediterranean, until Oct. 22.

&gt;The vessel will also be accompanied by two other ships, the Ataman and Cengiz Han.

&gt;The Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement on Monday that the illegal explorations south of Kastellorizo on the Greek continental shelf, at a distance of only 6.5 nautical miles from the Greek coast, “is a major escalation and a direct threat to peace and security in the region.”

&gt;“Just a few days after the meeting of the Foreign Ministers of Greece and Turkey, during which the Turkish side pledged to propose a date for exploratory contacts, its unreliability is demonstrated again as well as the fact that Turkey sincerely does not want dialogue,” Athens says.

&gt;“Turkey insists on the aggressive and illegal tactics of past centuries, clearly confirming its role as the pre-eminent factor of instability and delinquency in the region. From Libya to the Aegean and Cyprus, Syria, Iraq and now Nagorno-Karabakh,” the Greek ministry adds.

&gt;Earlier this month, the EU threatened to bring in sanctions on Turkey if it failed stop illegal drilling and energy exploration activities in Greek and Cypriot waters.

Sure the situation for Russia was not pretty afterwards. But this is what happens when evil regimes fall; it wasn't Gorbatchev's fault. (Actually quite the contrary. Arguably Russia's situation would have been much better if he had not been removed from power.

1782,"Technological advancement isn't the same thing as being civilized. 

Side note, indigenous cultures weren't in the stone age, some of them had metalworking ability. However, there were big issues with advancing technology overall, such as a lack in the Americas of large domesticated animals like horses or oxen which facilitate the labor that enables things like large scale agriculture (which is a prerequisite to non-nomadic/hunter-gatherer society and by extension advanced metalworking) and also a severe lack of workable tin deposits across the Americas. 

You might ask why tin is an issue, and the reason is the metals that indigenous peoples did have easy access to, copper and gold, are metals used by civilizations early on in technological advancement (both being malleable by simple hammering) with the next step generally being *bronze*, which is an alloy of copper and tin. Tin was more difficult to come by, so while they did have bronze working technology, it was generally very limited in scale. And that becomes an issue because early civilization is usually divided into 3 epochs- the copper age, the bronze age, and the iron age. The discovery of each metal generally facilitates the development of more advanced technology which may lead to the ability to use the next.

So saying 'lol yeah the natives were just in the stone age' is kind of, you know, strongly reductionist towards the real world circumstances that made technological advancement very difficult.",,/r/europe/comments/j9nhpl/today_in_1492_columbus_arrived_to_the_new_world/g8mx55p/,Ulight137,1602541785

&gt; there is no ""your system""

System was a bad word choice on my part. By system I meant how the Netherlands is being run as a financial conservative nation and chose to have a low national debt by handing in a lot of social welfare. While unpopular at first it seems to have clearly paid off now that we are entering another recession. 

&gt;A fiscal union means transferring funds directly from one region to another

This is exactly why there is no support for a EU fiscal union in the Netherlands. Transfering money from one region within your own country to another makes sense, we all contribute to the country's fund by paying taxes and vote in elections on how the money should be spent. I can't vote in any other EU country and therefore have no say on how their tax money is spent, so why should they get a share of our tax fund? This would be taxation without representation and is really undemocratic. I also have no interest in voting in another country, your citizens vote what is best for your country and the same applies here. No need to interfere with each other's politics, for us the EU was supposed to be a free market not some politcal union.

&gt;they lack the ability to raise and spend money themselves (firstly, because of their debt levels....

Ok this one is really on themselves. I'm assuming you are talking about Italy and I agree it is unfair that the current generation is stuck with the debt of previous generations, but they really fucked up here as a nation. Italy has a massive shadow economy of ~200 billion and needs to fix their taxation and corruption issues instead of hoping the EU will solve it and just give them money. I have lived in Italy in my earlier years and have seen how far and deep this goes, this one you need to solve on your own.

&gt; In fact, as long as the south is in an EMU with the north, it is mathematically impossible to fix their economies by themselves.

This might be a bit harsh, but why should we leave the EU or fix the situation? The north clearly benefits from the EU as it is while the south doesn't. If the south leaves or attempts to improve it for themselves we might change our policy, but at the moment we're just reaping the benefits of a good deal. You can pull the solidarity card , but on the end of the day we are business partners so don't expect it to come from us.

&gt; A fiscal union does what in the previous paragraph I explained is lacking - it forcefully invests money in the poor region in order to bring it up to speed. This is what the US has that the EU lacks

The US also has a huge difference in poor and rich regions. You can't tell me that Nebraska is just as developed and up to speed as California. We already invest in East and South Europe though the EU budget.

&gt; The third option is for the Netherlands to exit, of course. I doubt you will vote for that. But the rest of the Eurozone will plow ahead. The moment Germany agreed to it, it was a done deal.

I don't entirely agree. Yes it is clear that France and Germany want a financial union, but without support from other net contributors they won't get it. As rich as France and Germany are they can't and won't be willing to foot the bill for south and east Europe unless the others pay their share as well. The third financial aid package in 2018 for Greece almost caused the ruling coalition of the Netherlands to collapse. Then this year Rutte/VVD recently also faced a lot of criticism for eventually agreeing to the Corona package which was also very unpopular here.

1827,"&gt; Are we saying blacks and whites can't make friends, or that it's harder to make friends between races?

Yes, that's *exactly* what is being said. Take a diferent and easier example of men and women. Just generally, we know it's true that boys hang out with boys and girls hang out with girls. It's not universally true but it's generally true. If you have a male-dominated environment, it's easier for men to make friends. The same goes for women in female-dominated environments. You could imagine it would be harder to make friends with people who are from a different background than you and given how much segregation still exists in the US, it is a sad fact that white and black people often grow up in very different environments.

Again, I disagree totally with this approach from the article but I do think the point was to help people who couldn't so easily find people of their same background. It sounds dumb on the surface but, as you said, it actually points to a much bigger problem.

&gt; Beyond that, maybe your industry is different, I'm not familiar with it, but networking is generally done professionally, rather than on a personal basis.

Sorry, I'm from Canada and I call everybody I know my friend. I mean acquaintances or former colleagues (or sometimes friends). What I meant was that, generally, most people we know end up being from a similar background.

&gt; If it's ""We'll accept a less able and less qualified candidate in order to make our diversity statistics look better, then you know what my answer would be.

Do you have a problem with accepting a 98.5% scored candidate over a 97.3% scored candidate, using a hypothetical system of measurement?

At least with programming, I think it's pretty difficult to even judge somebody's worth anyway (which is why you have a probation period in jobs), so figuring out precisely who is a better candidate could be quite tough. In this regard, I don't see also considering diversity to be a bad thing. Again, we are not talking about hiring morons just to meet a quota. That is a fallacy, IMO. The only time something like that happens is in the case of nepotism (which is probably more likely to be an old white guy hiring a young white guy).

By the way, when my company hired me, they actually wanted to hire a woman. We've since hired several more programmers, none of them women. It's hard to find female programmers. And that starts in university. And even if it wasn't so hard, how many women want to work on a team where they are the one and only girl? So maybe they study something else or work somewhere else.

You’re gonna say, ""that’s political propaganda"". Then read Diogenes Laertius, historian of philosopher. Just look at the crazy-ass story about any of the people he write about, look at how there’s no single answer to things like ""where is he born"", or ""who was his father"", or ""what profession did he had"". Again, there’s slander in incredible proportion... Already the Greek knew that disinformation and demagoguery was a thing, they knew there was almost *zero* fairness in their lawsuit, for instance. There’s a famous story about a woman that had a trial, and the guy made her undress so that the lust of the audience would turn them in her favor... That was *classical* Greek trial right there! 

Disinformation was uncontrollable, because information traveled only through people, which is also the case today, but the thing is there was many more intermediaries back then...

1886,"Well, for starters, there is no ""your system"". You don't have your own system. You're part of an economic and monetary union with other countries. That's your system and it's a shared one. When all countries prosper, everything is great. But when some countries don't prosper, they drag other countries behind - because no country has its own system. The issue begins when several countries take advantage of other countries in the EMU. The Northern countries, specifically Germany, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Finland, Austria and to a lesser extent Denmark and Sweden (lesser because they're not in the monetary union, only in the economic one) are taking advantage of the southern countries and using ""beggar thy neighbour"" fiscal policies which basically syphon all the capital, money, investments, people and know-how in the union from the south (and east, specifically for the people) to the north. Your countries are singlehandedly bankrupting the south. The only way for this to reverse is for the southern countries to become more competitive, which is impossible for two reasons - they lack the outside investments (meaning your countries don't invest in theirs) and they lack the ability to raise and spend money themselves (firstly, because of their debt levels and secondly, because of austerity rules that northern countries forced upon them). Which leaves one and only one method of becoming more competitive - lowering wages, which is absurd in Europe. In fact, as long as the south is in an EMU wi the north, it is mathematically impossible to fix their economies by themselves. It's just simple Maths.

A fiscal union is designed to remedy that. A fiscal union means transferring funds directly from one region to another, similar to how Flanders funds Walloon, West Germany funds East Germany, North Italy - South Italy, Madrid and Catalonia the rest of Spain and so forth. A fiscal union does what in the previous paragraph I explained is lacking - it forcefully invests money in the poor region in order to bring it up to speed. This is what the US has that the EU lacks and is one of the big reasons why they're growing at a faster pace than the Eurozone. It's also the reason why East Europe is growing faster than the Eurozone.

And this brings us to the answer of the question why is it beneficial in the long term. Because of two reasons - the first is the obvious one. You're in an EMU with these countries, so your prosperity depends on their prosperity as well. 60 mln wealthy Italians who can come to Amsterdam, buy Dutch products and spend money in the Netherlands is vastly better for the Netherlands than 60 mln poor Italians who can't do jack shit. In fact, any dollar spent from the Netherlands in Spain, for example, via a fiscal union, has an enormous return. In essence, it's the same reason why you're spending billions in East Europe right now. A rich Poland is far better for you than a poor Poland. The second reason is that the current situation, with an incomplete EMU (it will be complete when the banking union, the capital markets union and the fiscal union are complete) is unsustainable. The main reason why there's such a big divide between the north and south isn't that the south is dumb or lazy, it's the structural deficiencies in the EMU. It's a bomb that's about to burst after 20 years of neglect - and either the Eurozone will collapse (which is VERY bad for the Netherlands) or the EMU is going to be completed (which means the Netherlands agreeing to the fiscal union). Which is, as explained, beneficial in the long term.

The third option is for the Netherlands to exit, of course. I doubt you will vote for that. But the rest of the Eurozone will plow ahead. The moment Germany agreed to it, it was a done deal. France and Germany will make a fiscal union and I reckon most others will join them.",Bulgaria,/r/europe/comments/j9piad/eu_moving_towards_fiscal_union_with_pandemic/g8mjp1f/,zar4er,1602534626

He believes that the Slovak National Uprising against the Nazi regime was a mistake. He also believes that remembering the president of said state as a Nazi traitor is also a mistake.

He owned an eshop called KKK, where if you made a purchase higher than 1488 Slovak crowns, you got a tear gas spray for free. If your purchase was higher than 8818 crowns, you got a telescopic baton.

A hockey club asked him for donation between 0 and 1500 euros. He donated 1488 euros.

He and members of his party often call minorities, especialy gypsies, parasites.

&gt;After this point, an African location became increasingly popular. This may have resulted from increasing ties between Europe and Africa as 1428 saw the Kings of Aragon and Ethiopia actively negotiating the possibility of a strategic marriage between the two kingdoms. On 7 May 1487, two Portuguese envoys, Pêro da Covilhã and Afonso de Paiva, were sent traveling secretly overland to gather information on a possible sea route to India, but also to inquire about Prester John.

Professor John Ioannidis, professor of medicine, epidemiology, statistics and biomedical data science estimated a 0.26% global IFR a long time ago

https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.13.20101253v3

if you're interested in a specific country, I have a collection of most studies for each country. None of them is above 0.6% most are far lower.



Is it not incredibly selfish to demand the entire society to conform to the needs of a small minority? And very shortsighted to only look at your own privileged position? Have you ever thought about the cost of the measures you want? The UN estimates that the the number of people living in acute food insecurity in countries affected by conflict, disasters or economic crises could jump from 149 million before the pandemic took hold to 270 million by year’s end if assistance is not provided urgently.
“Livelihoods are being destroyed at an unprecedented rate and now their lives are in imminent danger from starvation”
https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/07/1068601

the UN also estimates that almost half of the global workforce – 1.6 billion people – are in “immediate danger of having their livelihoods destroyed” by the economic impact of Covid-19, the International Labour Organization has warned.
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/29/half-of-worlds-workers-at-immediate-risk-of-losing-livelihood-due-to-coronavirus

In South Africa the lockdown measures will lead to 29 times more lives lost than the harm it seeks to prevent from Covid-19 https://www.businesslive.co.za/fm/features/2020-05-05-lockdown-disaster-dwarfs-covid-19-say-sa-actuaries/

in GB there will be as of now an additional 30'000 cancer deaths due to the measures https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/cancer-care-backlog-may-cost-30-000-lives-boris-johnson-told-2ttvw330l

due to these reasons the WHO argues against lockdowns

“We in the World Health Organization do not advocate lockdowns as the primary means of control of this virus,” Dr. David Nabarro said to The Spectator’s Andrew Neil. “The only time we believe a lockdown is justified is to buy you time to reorganize, regroup, rebalance your resources, protect your health workers who are exhausted, but by and large, we’d rather not do it.”

“Look what’s happened to smallholder farmers all over the world. ... Look what’s happening to poverty levels. It seems that we may well have a doubling of world poverty by next year. We may well have at least a doubling of child malnutrition.”

2113,"&gt;So all your points are basically 'just pick a mor eexpensive plan'.

We're talking about tens of euros of difference. The other perspective is that you can remove unnecessary features to pay less. Like I said, not everyone cares about choosing where they get treatment. It's a small country, so you'll always find endless healthcare providers. Personally I never chose a plan based on this feature.

&gt;Yes, this is called socialized healthcare. Something NL should also implement. I pay almost 400 Euro now and am way happier that way, because I know that even poor people can afford their health care.

Like I said, low income people get it subsidized. For 2020, the max you can get is 104€, which should cover it almost entirely. As a student, I ended up paying maybe 10€ per month and this will be true for a lot of low income people.

&gt;In Germany, I never, I repeat NEVER even met or saw a private-only doctor, they are that rare.

Depends on what you mean with ""doctor"". For a GP, yeah that's quite rare although they exist, but usually they specialize in """"""natural"""""" medicine or they market themselves towards expats. For other doctors, like psychiatrists, it's really not that rare. I think it's even pretty common.

&gt;That's just blatantly false. For most GPs, you can just walk-in almost every day, no appointment needed.

Yes, for acute problems doctors let you come in in the first hours usually. Lets say you worry about your blood pressure. That's not an acute problem and you'll have to make an appointment, at least over here. I've literally been told before by a GP to not come there for non-acute problems during these times. 

&gt;Private insurance is for people who want to have their single bed hospital rooms, completely unnecessary for anyone.

No it isn't only just for that. Plenty of specialized healthcare providers are either private-only (or for Selbstbezahler) or have elaborate private-specific services and will be a lot faster than non-private options. The PKV plans I've seen tend to be a LOT more comprehensive than whatever you get in the GKV.

Also just to be clear, I'm not saying the German system is bad. It still works fine. But it's definitely a LOT more expensive without offering more",NL -> Germany,/r/europe/comments/j782ih/change_of_wealth_inequality_in_europe/g8ls5fw/,BrQQQ,1602520607

2185,"I would actually argue that the ""teeth"" based on geographic criteria are the most fair solution. You simply measure distance. I do accept that there might be a need for a debate regarding Meis but that's the exception to the, otherwise good, rule. 

Regarding the ""teeth"" in question and a possible solution to the problem, the one between Rhodes and Meis will probably stand as it  is. The distance between those two islands is 120km, and the main ICJ ruling on a similar matter (Nicaragua - Colombia) has islands 90km away that are considered close enough to not allow a foreign ""tooth"" between them. Therefor, a small Turkish EEZ ""tooth"" in a slightly larger distance appears rational. 
For the larger one, between Meis and Cyprus, I am sure more people would be willing to concede the part of it in favour of turkey. I said ""part of it"", because if we ignore Meis for its calculation, it will still be measured to the mean points of Rhodes, Turkey and Cyprus EEZ, so the part awarded to Turkey would be smaller than the whole ""tooth"" currently claimed by Meis. 

In you want various other peculiar features in regards to EEZ, the south pacific is the place you want to look. You will things that looks really weird like [these](https://imgur.com/a/BatTTJe) features from the New Guinea EEZ.

About the oil and gas, I don't think any of the two countries are able to take advantage of the resources in any meaningful way.

This, of course, does not mean we need to celebrate the abuse inflicted on native americans. 

Go ahead and point out that Columbus was genocidal (he was), that he committed crimes (he did), and ordered crimes to be committed (he also did), but at the same time, we don't blame Columbus for _all_ of the suffering that innocent native americans have gone through.

If you really care about defending native americans, which is a noble cause, then point out [the injustices that native americans _continue to suffer even today_](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/30/joyce-echaquan-canada-indigenous-woman-hospital). It's a shame someone needs to record their own death while being insulted to get investigated. Canadian authorities still deny there is systemic racism that leads to this result and this isn't Columbus' fault. Don't scapegoat Columbus and whitewash others by doing so, because what happened to Joyce Echaquan wasn't Columbus' fault (well, not more so than, say, the fault of Scipio Africanus, who was also genocidal, but is not responsible of Joyce's death) for tipping the timeline in one or the other direction.",European Union,/r/europe/comments/j9nhpl/today_in_1492_columbus_arrived_to_the_new_world/g8ldo2b/,reaqtion,1602513033

Dante himself (1300) analyzed different languages in the peninsula, which he regarded as italian languages/dialects. Almost 200 years later, here is Columbus, a genoese by costitution, italian by culture.

2351,"&gt; The ONR considers itself an ideological descendant of the 1930s-era National Radical Camp, an ultranationalist, patriotic and antisemitic political movement which existed in the pre-World War II Second Polish Republic,[5] an illegal Polish anti-communist,[6] and nationalist political party formed on 14 April 1934 mostly by the youth radicals who left the National Party of the National Democracy movement.

...
&gt; First incarnation (1934)

&gt; The party was influenced by the ideas of Italian Fascism.[7][unreliable source?] It rejected parliamentary democracy and called for the construction of a ""national state,"" based on the principles of hierarchy, one-person leadership, and elimination of national minorities from public life.

...

&gt; Modern incarnation (1993)

&gt; In 2015, an ONR demonstration ended with the burning of an effigy of an ultra-Orthodox Jew.[25] Proceedings were opened for violating laws against ""insulting people based on religion, ethnicity, race or nationality"".[26]

...

&gt; In 2019, the Lublin-Południe District Prosecutor's Office opened proceedings against ONR for ""public propagation of a totalitarian regime"" after they published a Tweet celebrating Belgian fascist and SS officer Leon Degrelle.[27]

...

&gt; ONR attracted publicity in 2005, 2007, 2008 and 2009 for unauthorized marches during the anniversary of the anti-Jewish riot in Myślenice in 1936.[28][29][30] In 2005 the group had a couple of hundred members.[31]

...

&gt; ONR members at a 2008 rally in Myślenice made a Roman salute before disbanding. When questioned by reporters at the scene, the ONR leader claimed it is different from the Nazi salute.[34]

The Aegean Greek (for example Rhodes) EEZ and Kastellorizo EEZ don't unite somewhere near the place where the two islands are geographically closest? Isn't this an important argument?

Not the guy you are talking with. I can reply on the above question:

For every single one the possible points along that line the distance between Rhodes, Meis and Turkey is the same, so it the border. For every point in the area above that line, Turkey is closer, so said EEZ belong fully to Turkey. For every point in the area below that line, Rhodes / Meis is closer, so that EEZ belong to Greece (until you reach the 200nm limit or you reach a point where it is equidistant to another country).

Its exactly the same with the second ""tooth"", but in that case its between Meis, Turkey and Cuprus. 

Keep in mind that the above are true for the whole world. That is how EEZ (and to an extend territorial waters) are calculated under customary law and how UNCLOS suggests they are calculated.

That's where you're wrong. You're talking about EU's predecessor. The EU has rules and values. It was *exactly* created to control politics.

Article 2 of our Treaty:

&gt;The Union is founded on the values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities. These values are common to the Member States in a society in which pluralism, non-discrimination, tolerance, justice, solidarity and equality between women and men prevail.

It doesn't get more political than that.

These people are doing way more than just paying bills. They're getting serious bank. 

Look at Romania 1989. The GDP was **4.5 times lower** back then than current day Belarus. 4500% percentage. 

What did the army do when the revolution came? The army stood by the people. **The army is with us** became a big chant during the revolution. It didn't all go smoothly because it was crazy times but the army didn't start to protect Ceausescu.

2523,"&gt;There are formal paths a member state must follow. If this didn't happen then any country at any time could stop any of the laws that are in place.

No, buddy, you misunderstand for the fiftieth time. MOST of the EU legislation doesn't need unanimity in the EUCO. Most needs just a qualified majority. The rules on those are below. So if a country decides to ""block"" negotiations on such issues, they're just hurting themselves, because the other member states can still pass the legislation. About 80% of all EU legislation is passed with this procedure.

[https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/council-eu/voting-system/qualified-majority/](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/council-eu/voting-system/qualified-majority/)

Unanimity, however, is required for special topics, which are very important. Again, rules are below with the list of topics. Brexit is one of those. So a country can block ANY AND ALL TALKS ON SUCH TOPICS simply by not being there in the room. That's it. And keep in mind, that not participating in the vote is not the same as an abstention or a vote against. Not participating is simply blocking the vote itself.

&gt; blaming the source 

I think it's important to consider the source in anything we come across. After all everything is written for a reason. In this case the article is in the 'Opinion and Editorial' section of the paper so since it is not 'news' that makes it all the more important to try and understand whose opinion is being pushed onto us.. 

Khaleejtimes itself is a paper out of the UAE and as you probably already know the UAE and Turkey aren't the best of friends. Turkey supports the UN recognized government in Libya while UAE backs warlord Haftar for example. The author 'Mustafa Al Zarooni' is fairly high up in the paper, he 'Represent's Khaleej Times at all meetings with senior government officials' and 'go\[es\] through all sensitive stories in the newspaper'. Putting those together I think one could argue that this article is a propaganda piece coming out of the UAE. However, we should also look at the contents itself, after all it could just be reporting 'facts' with very heavy bias. Which brings me to 

&gt;the article

Looking past the article being an opinion piece, there are a couple arguments made

1. Turkey has been using its power and resources to form militias in Syria, Iraq, Libya and 'Arab countries'

In Syria this is somewhat true, there was a long list of actors bankrolling the FSA including the UAE and western countries but Turkey seems the be the only one left. In Iraq, there are training bases where Turkey works with the peshmerga. No internal militias have been formed in Libya or other Arab countries as far as I know. 

2. Bullying Greece and trying to trigger a crisis in the Med.

Arguments to be made here depending on which side you're looking at it from. 

3. Erdogan is mulling over expanding his power to Sudan and dragging it into quagmire

All I know is that Turkey had a couple of deals with the previous government but those fell through after the coup in Sudan. Don't know much else but assume Turkey and UAE are on opposing sides once again

Keeping in mind it's an opinion piece written with a heavy UAE and anti-Turkey bias and ignoring that it has zero facts to back anything up the content itself is ok I guess. Not 100% truthful but also not 100% lies. 

&gt;  the OP 

OP seems fine, just wants to post about porn, memes and the occasional anti-Turkey article. Much prefer it to the bot accounts that only post negative crap about Turkey. Seriously there are sometimes more articles about Turkey than anything else in this sub. 

&gt;  the racism 

In this sub or the article? There's sometimes racism here but the mods are generally pretty good in removing. They are sometimes selective in what they leave up which is a shame. 

&gt;the bad luck

We have nazar boncuğu to keep the bad luck away. 

&gt; This defence attitude is the reason that there is no possibility of improvement in their economy, their foreign relations, the human rights there etc. 

The only thing the average Turk can do is roll the dice and vote every 5 years, we have no control over anything you mentioned just trying to get by day to day. So I disagree that the defensiveness of Turkish redditors is what's causing all of our problems.

2752,"There were many Germans, yes, but *not* Hungarians. In fact, Hungarians have been in Sibiu, throughout the history of the city, a small minority. [Sibiu census](https://i.ibb.co/GRtWDRw/Sibiu-census.png)

There were only 977 Hungarians in 1850, compared to 2.089 Romanians and 8,790 Germans. And the proportions were kept until 1941 (after which Romanians become the actual majority).

Sibiu was a city founded by Germans. And built by them. The Hungarian influence is so nonexistent there that there are no buildings in the city of that sort. For perspective, Romanians built more than Hungarians even before the unification in 1918, building an orthodox cathedral (influenced by Hagi Sofia in Instanbul) in 1902 here.

As for the Hungarian name, Nagyzeben, it was only used briefly in history, after a time, along the original name of Hermannstadt, given by the Germans (initially Hermansdorf). Hungarians call it Nagyszeben, and you are welcome to do that, but the city literally has nothing Hungarian to it, being a small minority, not building anything and not contributing in any way to the social and cultural life of the city.

Sibiu, the southernmost part of Transylvania, is, in this respect, unlike any other Transylvanian city in the north, where Hungarian influence is more present.","Romania, Transylvania",/r/europe/comments/j90vqr/lutheran_cathedral_sibiu_romania/g8ke06q/,ArtDoesNotComeEasy,1602479936

First, annexation of ports with and for trade concessions or for trade routes are not very common in history. I can think of Gibraltar for example, whose population now is British and doesn't want to ""return"" to Spain. I think the will of people of Gibraltar should be respected in this situation.

When it comes to Armenia, it's important to think of a de jure territory i.e. what is historical Armenia. The de jure land is more or less today's Eastern Anatolia. While it didn't have a Armenian majority even in 1914, they perhaps had a plurality. So, IMO, it would have been fairest if historical Armenia was divided into two, and population exchanges occurred.

But today what would be the point of it? If Turkey gave half of the historical Armenia, Armenia wouldn't be able to populate it (if there was no genocide they probably would have the population to do it but it happened unfortunately) If Armenia wants some it could be considered, but frankly, independent of me, Turkey would never accept it.",Turkey,/r/europe/comments/j8lgak/fridays_for_freedom_movement_in_sweden_to_support/g8keh53/,MYE2001,1602480339

2778,"This is the letter he sent him (rough translation):

Five years ago I greeted you at the Vatican, on a Wednesday in October in St. Peter's Square. Besides giving you a present in my own hand, I left you a letter in which I expressed my admiration for your pastoral work on behalf of the poor and humiliated of the world.

Time has passed and you are still a man of ideas and your behavior is consistent with them. So I still have great respect for you as a religious leader and as Head of State.

I represent a government that is undergoing a profound transformation process whose hallmarks are honesty, justice and austerity, as well as love of neighbor, a precept that, I consider, is the essence of humanism. These convictions and principles are inspired by the most important historical events in Mexico, because in them are the greatest lessons that our people and their leaders have received at different stages.

So much so that this is the main reason for the visit made by my wife Beatriz Gutiérrez Mueller on my behalf. She makes this trip to obtain codices, objects and documents of our history so that they can be exhibited in our country next year, when the 700th anniversary of the founding of México-Tenochtitlán would be fulfilled; the 500 years of the Spanish colonial invasion and the bicentennial of our Independence, fact, the latter, by the way, headed by two good and rebellious priests: Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla and José María Morelos y Pavón and whose deep love for the people led them to pay with their lives the desired freedom of our country.

It is worth remembering that both Hidalgo and Morelos also fought, and this is what I consider most important, for justice. Hidalgo proclaimed the abolition of slavery and Morelos asked: “that poverty and opulence be moderated (...) that the salary of the laborer be raised (...) that the son of the peasant be educated, just like the son of the richer landowner (...) that there are courts that protect the weak from the abuses committed by the strong ”.

Consequently, Your Holiness, we would be very pleased if, as a loan for one year, with all the necessary care and legal and security procedures, the Vatican allows us to exhibit in Mexico, in 2021, the following codices :

1) Codex Borgia, inventory number: Museo Borgia, P. F. Messicano 1, of the Mixtec culture;

2) Vatican Codex N / Codex Vaticanus, inventory number Vat.lat3773, of the Nahuatl culture;

3) Vatican Codex 3738 (Codex Vaticanus A or Ríos Codex), 16th century, from the Toltec-Chichimeca culture;

4) Maps of Tenochtitlán.

I take this opportunity to insist that, on the occasion of these events, both the Catholic Church, the Spanish Monarchy and the Mexican State must offer a public apology to the native peoples who suffered the most disgraceful atrocities to plunder their property and lands and subdue them, from the Conquest in 1521 until the recent past.

They deserve not only that generous attitude on our part but the sincere commitment that never, ever, acts disrespectful to their beliefs, cultures will be committed and, much less, they will be judged or marginalized for economic reasons or racism. In particular, I think that it would be an act of humility and at the same time of greatness that the Catholic Church, regardless of the debate on whether Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla was excommunicated or not, would vindicate the historical feat of the Father of our Nation who, when accused of being heretic He defended himself by exclaiming: Open your eyes, Americans, do not allow yourselves to be seduced by our enemies: they are not Catholics but because of politics: their God is money, and the injunctions are only aimed at oppression. Do you think that someone who is not subject to the Spanish despot cannot be a true Catholic?

As you will surely agree, the previous reflection is beautiful, human and very current, that is why I dare to express to you: Don't you think that instead of affecting the Catholic Church a reference in honor of Hidalgo and Morelos, would exalt it and cause the happiness of the majority of Mexicans? Only his sensitivity could understand the significance of this act of historical constraint.

I bid you farewell with the hope that we can maintain our good relations and wishing you to remain healthy and long-lived. It is not necessary to meet, but if one day circumstances allow it, I would like to endorse my esteem and respect for you again.

I send a cordial greeting.",,/r/europe/comments/j8xf2w/mexico_asks_pope_francis_for_apology_for_churchs/g8jzm0x/,carlosortegap,1602469810

2845,"One in 10 new cars sold across Europe this year will be electric or plug-in hybrid, triple last year’s sales levels after carmakers rolled out new models to meet emissions rules, according to projections from green policy group Transport &amp; Environment.

The market share of mostly electric cars will rise to 15 per cent next year, the group forecasts, as carmakers across the continent race to cut their CO2 levels. The projections are based on sales data for the first half of the year, as well as expected increases as manufacturers scramble to comply with tightening restrictions in 2021.

“Electric car sales are booming thanks to EU emissions standards,” said clean vehicle director Julia Poliscanova. “Next year, one in every seven cars sold in Europe will be a plug-in.” 

Under the rules, carmakers must reduce the average emissions from their vehicles to 95g of CO2 per km or face fines that could run into billions of euros.
In the first six months of the year, average emissions fell from 122g to 111g, the largest six-month drop in more than a decade.

While 5 per cent of the cars sold this year are excluded from the calculations, a concession from the EU to help carmakers ease into the new regime, every vehicle counts towards the total from next year.
Environmental groups have criticised the concessions, as well as the fact that CO2 limits are not due to tighten again until 2030.

“EU manufacturers are back in the EV race, but without more ambitious CO2 targets in 2025 and 2030 to spur them on, they’ll run out of steam as soon as 2022,” said Mrs Poliscanova.
Several carmakers are still lagging behind the new rules, according to T&amp;E calculations, requiring a late spurt of electric sales, or the purchase of credits from a rival that has already exceeded the rules if they are to avoid large fines.

The system allows those who have generated “credits” by selling pure electric cars or plug-in hybrids to sell them to rivals that are struggling to meet the rules. The value of credits falls over time.
Volvo Cars earlier this month said it was open to selling its credits to competitors, having seen a sharp rise in hybrid demand this year. Daimler, which is part-owned by Volvo’s parent company Geely, is farthest behind its targets and most likely to require credits, according to T&amp;E.

Some carmakers have also been hobbled by the pandemic, which delayed key model launches and dented demand. VW saw the launch of its electric offensive slowed by the epidemic, and as a result is behind in its targets.

Hyundai and Kia are also lagging behind, with sales of the electric models such as the Hyundai Kona and the Kia e-Niro delayed by the pandemic.

Toyota, which is pooled with Mazda, is very close to meeting its targets because of its widespread use of traditional hybrids, which run an engine and a battery at the same time.
BMW, which relies on plug-in hybrids as well as its fully electric i3 model, has met the targets for this year, as has Renault, which sells the electric Zoe. Renault’s alliance partner Nissan, which sells the electric Leaf car, is close to its targets as well.",,/r/europe/comments/j9jplp/electric_car_sales_triple_in_race_to_meet_europe/g8k6zf5/,yuropemodssuck,1602474494

The situation in and in relation to Syria, and **in particular the actions by the Government of Turkey to conduct a military offensive into northeast Syria, undermines the campaign to defeat the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, endangers civilians, and further threatens to undermine the peace, security, and stability in the region, and continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States**. For this reason, the national emergency declared on October 14, 2019, must continue in effect beyond October 14, 2020. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13894 with respect to the situation in and in relation to Syria.

Europe), medium (S. Europe), and low GDP per capita (E. Europe) it is a good indicator of economic well-being. Aka when your GDP per capita is low it means your economy sucks.

2980,"as an American who escaped in the 80's, I can say I have DEFINITELY seen this.  Whether in Australia or Europe.    There was a fascination with American culture... the glitz, the glamour, the pomp and that uniquely American way of going about things.

my life went from enthusiastic encounters with lots of questions to pained looks as people tried to figure out how to ask what the fuck were we thinking, or my opinion on the latest electoral disaster.

A dog can be the cutest thing in the world when it gives you those puppy dog eyes, but after it has bitten you a couple of times.. those puppy dog eyes are not so cute anymore.    This is essentially what the US has done to itself.

What is worse.. there used to be diversity and variety in the exported US pop-culture. Unfortunately it is now almost exclusively corporate propaganda.   To many... America is not much more than Mickey Mouse nowadays.... and boy you should see the prevalence of the Mouse products over there... and NASA for some reason.

Ramble aside... the gloss has been lost, in no small part due to their international antics and lack of respect for anyone, and as others have extensively elaborated... it is abundantly clear the American dream is more akin to a nightmare.

&gt; Whilst in Europe everyone is happy with immigration 

Many Western European countries have pursued very broken immigration policies and as a result, far-right and nationalist sentiments have spiked. France, Sweden, Belgium, Germany to name a few. The UK has perhaps somewhat more balanced immigration policy as it attracts quite a number of specialists and people pursuing higher education. Compare that to Sweden, which, until a few years ago, basically took in masses of refugees and economic immigrants. Most of them, obviously, are poorly educated and often come from very alien cultural backgrounds. While it sounds very humane and what not, it has created a mountain of problems for Swedish society, from immigrant ghettos to crime gangs all the way to terrorist attacks.

I would have guessed higher education is something Brits are very proud of. What is more, English language gives a massive competitive advantage for seeking the best students and professors alike.

Why are you implying I’m a fascist?

Does anybody who disagrees with you, with your worldview, with your assessments, with your opinion, become a fascist?

You should stop using the word so much, you clearly have no idea what it means. 

Again, I read through the top 100 posts in that subreddit prompted by your comment (and others I’ve seen) and I find no evidence of them being fascist, or even hard right. 

It seems the only telling part of your post was when you said about “overwhelmingly left wingers” so we get to the root of why you attack that community. It is just another hard left smear against a place they disagree with. It is cancel culture. It is part of the constant hard left attempt to silence and drive out every single dissenting opinion by using the old “DEY R RACIST” card. This card has changed into the fascist card in recent years because the racism one has worn thin.

Brexit will be resolved without the EU caving in like so many pundits predicted, Covid19 got an unprecedented recovery fund to help fight its economic effects, Erdoğan had a failed stunt with refugees in March which stopped so far his strategy to use them as leverage, and Russia is still under sanctions, with Ukraine now more europhile than others.

3848,"&gt; Zuzana Caputova warns EU risks becoming ‘hostage’ to authoritarian member states
&gt; 
&gt; Zuzana Caputova urged national governments to grab the “unique opportunity” offered by a much argued-over plan to suspend EU budget payments to countries that breach the bloc’s democratic standards and fundamental values. 
&gt; 
&gt; Ms Caputova’s call in an interview with the Financial Times highlights fierce debate between member states and the European parliament over EU rule of law safeguard proposals drafted by Germany’s rotating presidency of the bloc. Her remarks also underscore the significant opposition in some central and eastern European countries to the slide towards autocracy in states such as Hungary and Poland. A former anti-corruption lawyer with no previous political experience, Ms Caputova’s election victory last year was a rare shot in the arm for central continental liberal, pro-European forces.
&gt; 
&gt; “Of course we need a sort of enforcement mechanism for rule of law to be observed across the EU, so we don’t become hostage to those who don’t want to follow these rules,” said Ms Caputova.
&gt; 
&gt; “This is also a unique opportunity to set the standards for the rule of law.”
&gt; 
&gt; Ms Caputova echoed calls by the European parliament and northern member states including Finland, the Netherlands, Sweden and Denmark for a tough rule of law protection mechanism, which is opposed by Hungary and Poland.
&gt; 
&gt; She said that the bloc needed to avoid relying on unanimity — a reference to the EU’s so-called Article 7 rule of law disciplinary proceedings against Poland in 2017 and Hungary in 2018, which have been stuck because each country has vowed to defend the other. 
&gt; 
&gt; “We need to move from unanimity to qualified majority at the very minimum,” she said. 
&gt; 
&gt; Ms Caputova said the EU pushback against authoritarian moves also needed to be more timely, given that the results of infringement court cases brought by the European Commission often do not arrive in time to stop the behaviour under scrutiny.
&gt; Protesters at a rally outside the Central European University in Budapest in October 2018. The institution has since relocated to Vienna © Bernadett Szabo/Reuters
&gt; 
&gt; The European Court of Justice last week ruled against a 2017 Hungarian law that in effect forced the Central European University, founded by the billionaire philanthropist George Soros, out of Budapest — but the institution has already relocated to Vienna.
&gt; 
&gt; “Justice delivered too late is no justice,” Ms Caputova said. “That’s why this time factor is so critical — and that’s why this efficient [new] mechanism is so needed.”
&gt; 
&gt; Asked if leaders from the conservative European People’s Party grouping, including Angela Merkel, Germany’s Chancellor, should have taken a firmer political stand against Hungary’s ruling Fidesz party, which is still a member, Ms Caputova replied: “What I’m still surprised about quite often is relativism of values. So on the one hand you have values that are being declared, and on the other hand you have activities that do not reflect those values.”
&gt; 
&gt; “Every mechanism is dependent on people. I want to go back to this personal responsibility of leaders because if we are not consistent in our values and we are not following what we are saying, then no mechanism is going to change that,” she said.
&gt; 
&gt; Ms Caputova has made justice and the rule of law one of her main priorities since sweeping to victory in Slovakia’s presidential election last year, powered by a wave of popular anger at the murder of Jan Kuciak, a young journalist who had been investigating corruption, and his fiancée Martina Kusnirova.
&gt; 
&gt; The killings sent shockwaves through the central European nation, spurring calls for reform of the country’s judicial system, and ultimately triggering the resignation of the then prime minister Robert Fico.
&gt; 
&gt; However, Slovakia’s efforts to draw a line under the case suffered a blow last month when a high-profile businessman accused of ordering the killing was acquitted by a special court. Prosecutors have appealed against the decision. 
&gt; 
&gt; Ms Caputova, who initially expressed shock at the verdict, said that there was no cause to think that the judicial process had been “corrupted” and that the decision and reasoning of the Supreme Court, which will hear the appeal, would be “crucial”.
&gt; 
&gt; As well as speaking out on the rule of law, Ms Caputova has been one of the few central European leaders prepared to openly challenge China, whose investment has been trumpeted by some capitals but is still dwarfed by European investment.
&gt; 
&gt; Last year, she used a meeting with Beijing’s top diplomat to criticise China’s human rights record, and last week she refused to give a speech at the high-profile annual security conference in Bratislava run by the Globsec think-tank because Huawei was a partner in the event. 
&gt; 
&gt; She went ahead with the speech after Globsec cancelled the partnership with Huawei.
&gt; 
&gt; Asked if she feared any consequences from her action, she said: “I’m a directly elected head of state of a sovereign country. I’m elected in a popular vote and I can freely choose what conferences I participate in or not.”",,/r/europe/comments/j90w1d/europe_must_be_tougher_on_rule_of_law_says_slovak/g8g637m/,mulgrave2,1602400120

Let's look at this article:
https://www.refworld.org/docid/52d51d774.html

Armenian defence ministry spokesman Artsrun Hovhannisyan told IWPR that the Paravakar-Vazashen highway was overlooked by Azerbaijani military positions located on higher ground. This vulnerability meant that extensive work would have to be done to make the route safe enough to be reopened.

""Earthen banks are being built for safety. But that's very difficult in this location,"" he said. ""Our adversaries are high up and we are lower down, which means we'd need to build 50-metre earthen banks. Right now it isn't possible for us to make it completely safe.""

This is 2014. Armenians can not use their highways near the border because Azeri snipers shoot at civilian cars. This is Genocide. This is why I want more territory, so Armenians can live in peace. What do some high mountains mean to you, an Azeri in Poland? You say you want peace, how is this peace? If you want peace, you want peace for both people. How does a cliff overlooking an Armenian highway belonging to Armenia and not Azeri snipers impact people in Baku, or you in Poland?

3976,"Another issue is that Lewandowski is a a more classical Nine while Messi a Ten.  Different roles on the field, with the latter taking on playmaking which involves immense creativity and vision in addition to technical abilities. However, I still think that Lewandowski deserved the Ballon D'or this season. Perhaps this was his only chance, but I'll have my fingers crossed for this season. 

For comparing leagues, I use the [UEFA coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_coefficient) which uses a formula and sums the points for the last five years of every team of that league in European championships (EL or CL). Currently (and for the last few years) La Liga is first, while the Bundesliga is fourth ranked. 

For comparing teams, there is a coefficient for that as well, but I like to compare how well the teams did in the CL of that year. I think Bayern definitely impressed this year. 

P.S. With Ronaldo gone to Seria A and Messi possibly moving to PL, I'm interested if La Liga will stay top league in the upcoming years.

The Armenian Genocide (and the pogroms in Baku and Sumgait) are different because: they were not isolated incidents, they were ordered by the government, they were perpetrated by soldiers under orders to commit genocide, and they were far from any warzone.

4099,"That's a bit of a misunderstanding and is only half true. When the democratic 1988 referendum was announced, Armenians only wanted the Armenian majority areas the region to be transferred to Armenia. NK's territories were specifically drawn to avoid Azeri majority areas. That's why 1988 NK looks strange. 

However, this desire to leave Azerbaijan, driven by ever increasing Azerification of the region and discrimination against ethnic armenians by the Azeri government, led to pogroms and state-wide violence against Armenians across Azerbaijan. Then the civil war happened, and for the first three years, Azerbaijan specifically targeted Armenian civilian settlements, including the city of Stepanakert. Lots of Armenian civilians perished. It was at this point the NK Armenians retreated into Azeri majority territories and then they deported the hundreds of thousands indigenous Azeris from these regions. Using these mountainous regions as a base, they were able to regain control of much of Nagorno-Karabakh. 

What should have happened was that, in place of the 1994 ceasefire, Azerbaijan should have recognized the independence and borders of the 1988 referendum and Armenia should have returned the buffer territories that fell outside of the 1988 referendum that the NK Armenians retreated to and took over during the first 3 years of the war, in order to let the IDPs return. 

But that's not what happened. The deal fell apart,barely, mainly because it was unpopular among the Azeri public and could have resulted in a coup of the Aliev family. Armenians were deported en masse from Baku, Sumgait, and Nakichevan much like how Azeris were deported en masse from Yerevan and from NK and the surrounding territories. 

The more Azerbaijan shells civilian settlements and creates Armenian IDPS, the less likely Armenia/NK is to return the buffer territories. The less likely the buffer territories get returned, the more likely the Azeri IDPs will remain IDPs.

For a vast majority of those buffer territories, Armenians aren't moving into them. They do not desire to move into old Azeri homes and villages- that's not what Armenians want. Once NK's safety and independence are recognized by Azerbaijan, those territories can and should be returned to those IDPs and Azerbaijan. But given Azerbaijan's militarism and desire to evade peaceful discussions, this will be a long while.",,/r/europe/comments/j7wrqd/armenia_and_azerbaijan_clash_in_the_disputed/g8ejf6q/,GhostofCircleKnight,1602377350

I didn't use it. I just said I've heard the same excuses from genocide deniers.

And let's talk about Khojaly, since you brought it up. I'll copy-paste a comment I made a couple of days ago, see what you think about it.

Yes, Azeris were killed; but they were killed in war, not because the Armenian government hunted them down and killed them. Khojaly, for example, was right after a major military offensive, and rogue volunteers (basically Armenians with guns from Sumgait, who had survived the famous pogrom there) and had just seen Armenian civilians relentlessly bombed wanted revenge. Their commanders (the famed Monte Melkonian among them) tried to stop them but were unable to contain them since again it was chaos. Did the government condone them? No, on the contrary they thought what had happened was horrible. Ask any Armenian today if they think what happened that day was right, and they will tell you that it was shameful and that anybody who partook in that shouldn't even be considered Armenian. But how many Azeris feel shame over the Sumgait and Baku pogroms? How many accept that what happened in Nakhichevan was a crime against humanity? Not to mention that Baku and Sumgait are arguably worse since they were far from the front lines, and that the Azeri government actively encouraged it.",Armenia,/r/europe/comments/j7wrqd/armenia_and_azerbaijan_clash_in_the_disputed/g8ekm41/,Imperator-Rome_95-BC,1602377782

Name an example please. What attempts to grab as much land as possible?

&gt;Armenia went after Azerbaijani land since Azerbaijanis was a lot less likely to fight back than Georgians.

That makes no sense seeing as how the conflict has been going on for more than three decades and its only been Azerbaijani since Joseph Stalin gave it to the Azerbaijani SSR to sow division and cause ethnic strife to keep the Soviet Republics dependent on Moscow.

&gt;Armenian Supremacy considers Turkic people sub-humans, untermenche. 

Not sure what you mean by ""Armenian Supremacy"", but the Armenian government and Armenians in general don't look at Turkic people as sub-humans. 

&gt;That is why Armenians committed Genocide of Azerbaijani people in Armenia and Karabagh. Azerbaijan will not let Armenians continue with their Genocidal policy of exterminating native population of Karabagh.

4164,"HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN’S story of “The Princess and the Pea” is not on the reading list of many foreign-policy wonks. Perhaps it should be. In the Danish fairy tale, a pea is secretly placed beneath a stack of mattresses on a young lady’s bed. She finds the tiny bump horribly uncomfortable, thus proving herself to be a princess. It is a surprisingly relevant lesson for the EU. The bloc sees itself as a superpower, but when it comes to foreign policy it sometimes behaves like a dainty princess. A single objection from even a pea-sized state is enough to scupper its plans.

So it was when Cyprus, the third-smallest EU country in population and a rounding error in terms of GDP, became a one-country obstacle to sanctions against the Belarusian authorities. Unless the EU agreed to sanctions on Turkey for menacing Cypriot waters, the island would refuse to back similar measures on Belarus. A bloc with designs on being a global actor was held back from flexing its muscle at a country next-door by one of its smallest members. Senior EU wallahs despaired. “Our credibility is at stake,” declared Josep Borrell, the EU’s foreign-policy chief. As in Andersen’s telling, small discomfort led to late-night strife: it was only during an EU leaders’ summit that dragged on past midnight—the most auspicious hour in any fairy tale—that Cyprus backed down.

The Cypriot last stand renewed calls for the EU to switch to qualified majority voting on foreign-policy issues. This would allow countries representing 55% of all member states and two-thirds of the EU’s population to ram through any policy. Mr Borrell is a fan of the idea, as is Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission’s president. They have a compelling case. How can the EU face up to China or America if countries representing a fraction of its citizens are able to stymie its ability to act? Imagine American foreign policy if, say, Delaware were able to veto the actions of the federal government. In a world without vetoes, the likes of Cyprus would no longer be able to hold others to ransom. Remove the pea, they argue, and Europe can proceed undisturbed.

Scrapping such vetoes would be a big shift. They loom large in the EU’s history. Charles de Gaulle, the former French president, spent the 1960s blocking things he did not like (such as the entry of Britain). A compromise emerged whereby national capitals would not throw their weight around, unless they felt their vital interests were threatened. In a club of half a dozen, allowing each country to scupper a policy made some sense. Now the EU is a cumbersome body of 27 sovereign countries. On most topics, such as the workaday issues of governing the single market, vetoes have been replaced by “qualified majority” voting. About 80% of EU laws are passed this way. But on controversial topics, such as tax, trade deals and foreign policy, unanimity is still required.

Removing these powers, though, would be a mistake. Critics of vetoes fall back on comforting fairy tales. In their telling, with no vetoes a beefier foreign policy is possible. This is naive. Foreign policy is difficult for the EU precisely because countries do not agree on fundamental issues. Whereas France takes an aggressive approach on Turkey, Germany has been doveish. Russia is seen as a potential ally in France, a business opportunity in Germany but a threat in Poland and the Baltic states. Hammering together a cohesive foreign policy on one of these topics, then forcing it through via a majority, is a recipe for rows. The fairy tale is alluring because Brussels is good at procedure. But procedure does not resolve political disputes, points out Nicolai von Ondarza from the German Institute for International and Security Affairs (SWP).

Nor is there a guarantee of a happily-ever-after with qualified majority voting. It can backfire. In 2015 EU countries pushed through a decision to relocate refugees against the wishes of Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Their response was simple: they ignored it. EU leaders made a gentlemen’s agreement not to force such measures through in this way again. Consensus is far more comfortable for diplomats, and for good reason. In the kaleidoscopic world of EU politics, any country can find itself in the minority on a particular issue. Overrule a fellow EU member state one week, and you may find your own country overruled the next. In some years as many as 90% of decisions are passed without a single vote against, according to figures from SWP.

**Fairy tale or horror story?**

The power of vetoes to make or break the EU is overstated. They tend to delay decisions rather than stop them. Last year Emmanuel Macron, France’s president, halted the accession process to the EU of North Macedonia and Albania. But after a few months of largely procedural fiddling, both countries were allowed to take the next step towards membership. When David Cameron vetoed a fiscal treaty at the height of the euro-zone crisis, some legal gymnastics allowed fellow EU leaders to bypass the British blockade. Even Cyprus’s last stand delayed the EU’s sanctions on Belarus (in any case rather puny) by only a few weeks.

Vetoes have their uses, too. Charles Michel, the European Council president, is right when he argues that unanimity breeds legitimacy, which is vital for the EU’s still fledgling foreign policy. An American state can swallow disagreements in a way that the EU’s sovereign members cannot. It may lead to lowest-common-denominator policies, but this is better than ambitious ones that are ignored. Overriding Cyprus’s wishes would be one thing, but a foreign policy without the backing of, say, France, now the bloc’s sole global hard power, would be preposterous. The veto is the weapon of last resort for small countries, who make up the bulk of EU member states. If Cyprus is steamrollered on Turkey, then Estonia may fear that its interests will be overlooked on Russia. Its occasional use does little to blow the EU off course, while reassuring national capitals that their existential concerns will never be trampled beneath majority rule. Like a pea, a veto causes brief discomfort. But the EU is not a fairy-tale princess. It can cope.",,/r/europe/comments/j8tqii/scrapping_vetoes_wont_help_european_foreign_policy/g8dtfca/,blue_strat,1602368973

It was relevant to the discussion.

&gt;As detailed in your source you have to explain your example, it took you two comments to do so... Should I guess what you are thinking?

I honestly thought you would understand such a basic example without issues and I didn't think I needed to elaborate on it more. I was apparently very mistaken. 

&gt;So the change cannot accommodate the UK if they didn't ask for it in the first place?

Re-read the comment you are answering and then come up with a something that addresses it. 

&gt;It is about the border, the border is not only a line between two places, a border between countries, imply trade and other kinds of limitation if not stated otherwise by treaties. The whole point is about the new border that will come between the EU and the UK. The whole discussions, brexit trade deals, change EU laws for dual-listed companies, ...

Lots of things the UK benefit from though. It don't mean it's therer to accommodate them. For example they benefit from peace on the continent.

&gt;And as stated by the commission in your article there is already process that can be used for this particular topic.

Yes, and they will likely also benefit from that vis-a-vis a no deal situation.

&gt;Then why ask me to detail the rule mentioned in this article?

No. They handed over the money to Europe knowing that a strong European economy will pay off all the debt eventually (and it sure did). In this case too, the cost of doing it with Polish and Romanian governments will be much lower than additional expenses during a hypothetical war without said investment. Also, this could be seen as a counteraction of US seeing the enormous success of Chinese BRI. 

Also, do note that you can't impose tolls on roads in Eastern Europe to bring in revenue for German and Dutch government. EU law on the funds prohibits imposing tolls on publicly funded roads, no matter whether the country of construction or another is to benefit. Besides, it's a ridiculous idea.

4637,"&gt;We are here talking about changed the laws for Ireland among others, not the UK. 

And they push for a change in the law to leverage brexit disruption caused by the UK aka the ___now foreign country___ leaving the EU.

&gt;That was not what you initially said but okay, at least you changed the argument when you realised it didn't make any sense. 

I mean... 

&gt;A specific trade agreement between the EU and any countries, the UK, Canada, Japan,... is somehow changing the process at the border of the single market, not changing the single market.

That sound quite similar to me.

&gt;The uniqueness of those trade deals can't be compared with the one that the EU is trying to negotiate with the UK if we are going to trust Barnier. Regardless the point is that the uniqueness of the UK agreement isn't something that I says. I'm just repeating what the EU through Barnier are saying.

It is still __a trade deal__ and you seem to agree as you use the exact same term to describe it.

[Dutch teenager arrested after fight breaks out in Austrian ski resort](https://www.dutchnews.nl/news/2020/01/dutch-teenager-arrested-after-fight-breaks-out-in-austrian-ski-resort/)

[Czech appeals court sends two Dutchmen to prison for beating up Prague waiter](https://news.expats.cz/weekly-czech-news/czech-appeals-court-sends-two-dutchmen-to-prison-for-beating-up-prague-waiter/)

Some say these last two Dutchmen aren't really Dutch. I beg to differ, but this happened last summer:

[Five arrested as Dutch holidaymakers bring agro to Knokke-Heist](https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/en/2020/07/08/five-arrested-as-dutch-holidaymakers-bring-agro-to-knokke-heist/)

Literally hundreds of upper-class whiter than white Dutch teenagers demolishing the Belgium town of Knokke. One of the inhabitants of Knokke explains it best:

&gt;Sean Veillefon runs a restaurant in the area: “These guys are very young, 15, 16.  I’m only 22 but I have more respect for the police.  They were hitting the police and insulting them”.

A lot of Dutch young people behave like this. Complete lack of respect for authority. If you tell them to behave, you get a mouthful of curses thrown back at you, and often even worse than that. Especially when they're drunk or under the influence of drugs. A lot of 'm have a ""no one tells me what to do""-attitude, and if you dare to do so, you *will* suffer the consequences. I mostly blame the parents.

If you don't believe me, I'll invite to visit a night out in any Dutch city and look what happens, especially during closing time. You can see it for yourself.

On behalf of the normal part of my country, I apologize for these morons. For all I care, you lock 'm up as long as Greek law allows to and/or hit them with the biggest fine possible.",,/r/europe/comments/j8jhlt/poros_greece_drunk_dutch_tourists_steal_public/g8bbqr9/,ruined_cappuccino,1602333407

I saying that your argument also apply to the trade deal and nothing of what you have said have countered that.

So to recap your argument:

4923,"It may have oposite effect though, it may strengthen image of EU as the bad guy, especially since EU is frequently hypocritical, some countries being more equal then others in front of EU rules or values.

How EU is going to be taken seriously when they criticise one country for some problems while turning blind eye to another country with same problems on MUCH larger scale, there were EU politicans saying that Poland has the worst problem while they completly ignored problems in countries like Bulgaria.

Another example, EU criticises Polish government for interfering with seperation of power(which is a fair point) but they completly ignore the fact that in France government has significent influence on juidicary.

Judicial appointments in France are determined by the country’s High Council of the Judiciary. This is composed of 12 members, but given the specific features of the French system of government, the nation’s president has the majority of votes in the council. How so?

The president of France is himself part of the High Council of the Judiciary, and he also appoints three of its members. The other members are: the heads of the National Assembly and the Senate (both usually come from political parties allied with the head of state); the justice minister (usually politically close to the president); a prosecutor; a representative of the country’s constitutional court; and five judges. This inevitably means that the president -- a politician -- has the majority of votes in the High Council of the Judiciary.


Why no one cares about seperation of power in France ?

In general France is getting a lot of free passes like when they were breaking EU deficit rule for years, one of most fucked up things I saw in recent years was EU was threatening Italy for getting close(they were getting close but didnt break rule yet) to breaking deficit rule while at the same time talking about giving France free pass  ""just this once"" to break deficit rule which was going to happen just after they finally stoped breaking deficit rule which they were breaking for YEARS.

Hell even in Poland EU shown hypocrisy, when previous goverment was in power which is so liked by the west EU was completly ignoring the fact that they tried to gain almost complete control over constitutional tribunal, they were rushing law that if passed would mean that 14 out 15 judges in the tribunal would been selected by them, EU had zero problem with this.

EU is creating image for itself that as long as you listen to what EU is telling you to do you can break EU rules/values as much as you like and you wont be punished.

4936,"&gt; Remind me again how your offensive and intrusive actions against Syria, Cyprus, Armenia, Greece and Iraq are defensive in nature?

Armenia, Greece lol?

The invasion of Cyprus was to prevent a coup d'etat by the EOKA-B group to unite the island with the state of Greece. If you look in the history of Cyprus, you will see that there was quite a lot of tension between the local Cypriots and Turks, and there were allegations that Turks on the island would often get targeted, massacred and oppressed by nationalist Greeks.

When this coup d'etat attempt happened, it posed a massive risk to the Turks on that island. To defend the safety of their own citizens, Turkey intervened militarily. If our goal was to conquer the whole island, we would've done so as we totally could have.

There are no Turkish troops on Greek land so I don't know what that is about, same for Armenia, there is literally 0 Turkish presence there so I don't know what you're on about at all.

&gt; Have you illegally moved armed forces into their territory and been asked to leave?

What's the point of invading Cyprus, Iraq, Syria to defend yourself and then just leave when they tell you to? Syria worked together with YPG and supported them, that's on them. Iraq doesn't even bother to take action against the PKK who have launched attacks from there against Turkey for 40 years. 

&gt; You weren't invited; you entered anyway.

Yes, because we can if there is a threat against our country.

I completely agree with you about the hard working immigrants.

They are always with the fear of deportation. It's a very sad situation I'm very against of, but I'm on the minority political group (left wing) who even cares :(

Jews from all over the world can get instant citizenship in Israel. But we accept that because we see Jewdism as an ethnic group and not only a religion.

It is generally associated with policies of economic liberalization, including privatization, deregulation, globalization, free trade, austerity, and reductions in government spending in order to increase the role of the private sector in the economy and society; however, the defining features of neoliberalism in both thought and practice have been the subject of substantial scholarly debate.

5161,"&gt;But Russia made Turkey back off and apologize precisely because of sanctions against them

No, nowhere near that

They did it because Russian airforce just completed rearrangement of the geographic features in the entire province that was up until that point a first in line to seceded from Syria and join Turkey (this is one of those now often forgotten details about that war but it was a big deal at a time and early prototype of what Turkey did later in Syrian Kurd areas)

Entire Turkish proxy army in the region was physically annihilated over period of more than two months of Vietnam/Iraq-2 combo style bombing campaign

Entire population of that region who were up until that point extremely pro-Turkey and in favor of secession suddenly became fanatically loyal Syrian citizens (after watching mountains around them literally burn for two months and knowing that only reason they are still alive is because someone in Moscow decided to allow them to)

Kurd militias inside Turkey mysteriously started using Igla MANPADS and Turkish helicopters started getting shot down

Turkey was cut off from any trade with Russia which choked off money flow from agriculture and tourism and sent shockwaves through Turkish economy

This all led to Turkish military making a clumsy and weird attempt at coup d'etat which lit additional fire under Erdogan's ass

Development of poorer areas. This received €54bn (£41.4bn), or **39% of the total [budget of the entire Union].**

The EU paid almost as much towards developing poorer countries and regions of the EU as it did for farming.

It spent €31bn (£23.76bn) on regional development, on projects across **all underdeveloped regions of the EU.**

It gave €13bn (£9.97bn) to projects in the **15 poorest EU countries:**

5397,"I don’t know much about this, but Portugal has economic difficulties and it’s one of the most aged countries in the world, even inside Europe. Our birth rate is probably on the top 10 or 5 in the world. So the government wants young immigrants, but not the usual low skilled immigrants from the usual 3rd world countries and with very different cultures who will end up in segregated neighbourhoods, they want high skilled immigrants that are basically europeans but with better economic status than us, so that’s a way of getting those people from the sephardic communities of similar developed countries. 

I’d personally be okay with historical inheritance citizenship (?) if it was done more fairly, such as not conveniently forgetting about iberian muslims for no reason and having at least some decent requirements such as basic language level and a few days of living in the country. Otherwise I don’t see why some random dude in America who’s never set foot in Portugal should be given citizenship on demand when there are already so many people with a real connection to the land who’ve been living the hard immigrant life for years and years, without any help, cleaning toilets, learning the language, etc etc. Especially us being a nation of emmigrants we should have more respect for the immigrants who work really hard, and then that random american dude gets free citizenship on demand whithout ever having stepped foot in Portugal. I don’t know if you know what I’m talking about because your country’s immigration policy is quite different from Europe’s, but maybe you even know one of the immigrant families like the one I’m talking about. I get that in Israel it’s a bit unstable / potentially dangerous so I totally understand why israelis would need a safer place to move to. It’s just that I don’t think this law was well thought out / done fairly. 

Also, many people usually abuse that and just get free citizenship just to get EU passport and never even set foot in Portugal, which does look very ungrateful and disrespecting to the hardworking immigrants who actually want to get portuguese citizenship to stay in the country but don’t get it. 

Oh, btw, you’re the first person I see who accepted it. Are you living here? How are you finding the country? I’m totally biased but I really think Portugal is one of the best countries to live in, if you forget about the economic difficulties. I wonder why the rest of the world hasn’t realized it yet. The world seems so shitty compared to Portugal, even in Northern Europe such as UK, Germany, Poland, etc, Portugal just seems so much more peaceful.

5446,"Hmm.

I get your point. Looking at a graph of New York, for example, it shows a clear peak that one would call the ""first wave"". However, when you look at the graph, you can see that for the EU as a whole, there was a clear ""first wave"" peak, but when you look at USA as a whole, you don't get that. So what gives? Seems that in the EU, most countries got the first wave at the same time, and mostly got it under control at the same time as other EU countries. Whereas in the USA, the start of the wave in each state was spaced differently from other states, and apparently some states never got it under control.

Regardless, my point stands: The area under the curve, that is, the total amount of covid cases, is much higher in USA despite USA having as smaller population. The interesting thing to see in the coming months is whether this means that USA won't get hit as hard by a ""second wave"" as the EU, as more people got infected (and therefore presumably immune) in the first wave.",Finland,/r/europe/comments/j7wkyq/eu_covid19_daily_cases_soar_past_united_states/g8920t7/,Aarros,1602275471

5514,"&gt;Erdogan should take a workshop in realpolitik or something.

Well the thing is, I think realpolitik is exactly what he is doing.

Erdogan's position on foreign policy has not always been this aggressive, infact if you go back to the days when he was PM, his mission statement for foreign affairs used to be:

&gt;Don't make enemies, make friends

This was also during the time when he was sucking up to the EU and even floating the idea of reconciling with Armenia.

The reason his foreign policy has become so hostile all of a sudden during the last 2 years or so has to be some kind of political calculation on his part.

My pet theory is that he's realized that the Turkish economy (and his own popularity) is in deep shit, so he's DESPERATLY looking for as many distractions as possible. Hence why Turkey seems to be jumping from controversy to controversy every month.

This is after all taken straight from the authoritarian playbook, when your popularity is dwindling, blame someone else to distract people from their misery.

If you think europe did a war on drugs, you're wrong. Every member state has its own drugs policy. NL and Poland, Portugal and UK are just some examples of polar opposite drugs policy. The USA has a higher rate of drug abuse due to their proximity to where most drugs come from (south america)

I linked you to a documentary of the war, I would suggest you watch it as it might provide a glimpse of how it was an uprising which actually led Armenia to follow Nagorno Karabakh to independence, and even the Karabakhi Armenians who were in charge of this uprising in fact got to rule Armenia until 2018.

Armenia lending support, which it officially does, does not automatically translate to an invasion of Nagorno Karabakh nor forfeit the latter's right to self-determination for being a break-away region as per the Helsinki Final Act of 1975 which is the basis of the framework of the OSCE Minsk Group as mandated by the UN and as agreed to by Azerbaijan. This is moreover the case when Armenia does not recognise Nagorno Karabakh (unlike Turkey with TRNC) nor officially has annexed it (unlike Russia with Crimea), but instead Armenia agreed that the final status of Nagorno Karabakh is to be determined by the UN-mandated OSCE process, and so did Azerbaijan (EDIT: Reiterated by Azerbaijan as late as less than three hours ago: https://www.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN26U27L)",,/r/europe/comments/j7wrqd/armenia_and_azerbaijan_clash_in_the_disputed/g88ql7w/,Idontknowmuch,1602269232

5656,"Reading about the [Bucharest Pogrom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legionnaires%27_rebellion_and_Bucharest_pogrom#The_Bucharest_pogrom) is truly horrific. When the Iron Guard rebelled after General Antonescu wanted to get rid of them they proceeded to kill as many Jews as they could get their hands on. Some excerpts:

&gt;The persecutors were headed by Mircea Petrovicescu, the son of the minister of the interior who was deposed by Antonescu. Petrovicescu tied Jews to targets and shot them, aiming not to hit them but to draw a line around them. He also used Jewish women stripped naked and tied with their backs to the target. After he was done shooting, they bore into the women's breasts with a drill, or cut them. Only one woman survived this treatment, but she was later executed with other Jews.

&gt;On 23 January, a few hours before the rebellion was quelled, a group of Legionnaires selected 15 Jews at random. They took them in trucks to the local slaughterhouse, where they were shot. Five of the Jews, including a five-year-old girl, were hung on the slaughterhouse's hooks, still alive. They were tortured, their bellies cut and their entrails hung around their necks in a parody of shehita, kosher slaughter of cattle. The bodies were labeled ""kosher"". The slaughterhouse was closed for a week to purge and clean the house of the results.",Romania,/r/europe/comments/j7vk0o/romania_marks_today_the_national_day_for/g88b0sc/,Deriak27,1602261154

5676,"&gt;The war in the East of Ukraine is steadily dying out, no? 

Sure, it's a textbook frozen conflict. 

&gt;Pretty sure that's just Russia being unwilling to take things to the next step, open another chapter and have the territories controlled by rebels join Russia.

That's ass backwards. If those territories joined Russia the war would end instantly, and so would any discussion about the status of those territories. There was no war in Crimea. 

The actual hot phase of the war ended in 2015 with a Russian victory. There is a ceasefire since then, which is respected more or less, but there have been no actual military operations by either side. 

&gt;Because it doesn't want to get sanctioned just for that territory. And if it's not planning to get these ""republics"" in the near future then it makes sense that it lets some territory go by not intervening with more forces. I don't think there's a contradiction there.

The DNR and LNR are valuable not because of territory, but because they block Ukraine in their sorry attempt to go Westward. It's a lever that Russia can use at will, and keeps Ukraine at the negotiating table or else.

If those territories joined Russia, that lever would be gone. There are no negotiations over Crimea, and there is no room to escalate the situation in Crimea, it's a done deal.

Besides, and intervention in the early phases of the war would be easier for Russia, and they'd get to keep more territory.

Romania didn’t join Germany because of that reason, we joined them because it was the only option left.

Romania was neutral up until 1940 when the USSR annexed Bessarabia and North Bucovina as a consequence of the Molotov Ribbentrop pact.

2. [Bacău bypass, which will be finished by UMB most likely this spring, in March/April](https://youtu.be/-10kJ0S_0XE?t=465)

The only one that is doing bad is A10 (the Pizzarotti company), way behind schedule, a year or so.

The major reason highways are now a priority and are treated seriously is because the ruling party at the moment, the liberals/PNL, are trying hard to have something to brag about. And since infrastructure is big in every Romanian's eyes, that's what PNL chose to target to gain maximum popularity.

STOCKHOLM/PARIS (Reuters) - Orange ORAN.PA and Proximus PROX.BR have picked Nokia NOKIA.HE to help build 5G networks in Belgium as they drop Huawei amid U.S. pressure to exclude the Chinese firm from supplying key telecoms equipment.

The moves are among the first by commercial operators in Europe to drop Huawei from next-generation networks and come after months of diplomatic pressure from Washington, which alleges Huawei equipment could be used by Beijing for spying.

The Belgian capital Brussels is home to the NATO alliance and the European Union’s executive and parliament, making it a matter of particular concern for U.S. intelligence agencies.

“Belgium has been 100% reliant on Chinese vendors for its radio networks - and people working at NATO and the EU were making mobile phone calls on these networks,” said John Strand, an independent Danish telecoms consultant.

“The operators are sending a signal that it’s important to have access to safe networks.”

The United States welcomed the decisions by Orange Belgium and Proximus, which have a network sharing agreement.

“This is the latest example of evaporating Huawei deals and further confirmation of this worldwide momentum towards trusted vendors,” said Keith Krach, the U.S. undersecretary at the State Department for economic growth, energy and the environment.

Huawei [HWT.UL], the world’s biggest telecoms equipment supplier, strongly denies the U.S. allegations and has been highly critical of calls to ban it from 5G contracts.

However, it said on Friday it accepted the decisions by Orange Belgium and Proximus, which confirmed an earlier Reuters exclusive.

“This is the outcome of a tender organised by operators and the result of the free market,” a Huawei spokesman said.

“We embrace fair competition, the more diversified a supply chain the more competitive it becomes,” he said, adding Huawei had been supplying equipment in Belgium for more than a decade and its commitment remained unchanged.

The decisions leave Liberty Group's Telenet TNET.BR as the only mobile carrier in Belgium yet to say which supplier it will use for its next mobile networks. Telenet currently relies on equipment made by China's ZTE 0763.HK, and plans to announce its 5G decision in the first half of 2021, a spokeswoman said.

CLOSER SCRUTINY
The deals to supply radio gear to Orange Belgium and Proximus are a boost for Nokia, which struggled to make headway in the 5G market earlier this year even as Huawei was under pressure.

“I have tried to become RAN (radio access network) supplier to Orange Belgium since 2003 when the company was still Mobistar. Here we are, finally,” tweeted Tommi Uitto, president of Nokia Mobile Networks.

The companies did not disclose a value for the contracts.

Nokia shares were up 3% in afternoon trading.

Orange Belgium and Proximus said Ericsson ERICb.ST would supply the core of their 5G networks, a smaller slice of business.",,/r/europe/comments/j801ok/huawei_ousted_from_heart_of_eu_as_nokia_wins/g87x34t/,quixotic_cynic,1602254076
5766,"[2]

EU members have been stepping up scrutiny of so-called high-risk vendors. This subjects Huawei’s governance and technology to critical examination and is likely to lead other European operators to strip it from their networks, analysts say.

Nokia and Ericsson have been the main beneficiaries of the challenges facing Huawei. From Bell Canada BCE.TO and Telus Corp T.TO in Canada to BT BT.L in Britain, the Nordic companies have been grabbing market share from the Chinese firm.

Separately, Nokia said it had won a contract to provide data management software to Telefonica UK, which said the Finnish firm would replace the less than 1% of Huawei kit in its network.",,/r/europe/comments/j801ok/huawei_ousted_from_heart_of_eu_as_nokia_wins/g87x4w0/,quixotic_cynic,1602254103

Żydzi nie czują się u nas zagrożeni, nikt ich nie atakuje, nie opluwa, nie obraża, nikt nie organizuje napadów na ich spotkania, na synagogi (krakowska nawet ochrony nie ma), nikt nie próbuje ich na ulicy zadźgać. To się dzieje na ulicach niektórych zachodnich miast.

Ty zaś wlatujesz tutaj na białym koniu i próbujesz wmówić wszystkim, że nie, jednak się mylę, tutaj jest okropnie, mimo że nie jest.

5869,"It's not that horrifying. I think everyone expected much worse. In fact it's considered a miracle that Finland survived the war with so little damage. 

After the Nuremberg Trials Stalin demanded that the Finnish war-time leaders be handed over to the Soviet Union, so that they might be prosecuted for waging a war of aggression. President Risto Ryti was willing to accept with this. He was prepared to hand himself over in order to spare Finland from further trouble. Field Marshal Mannerheim, who had been the commander-in-chief of the Finnish army, had a different plan. If the Soviets came to get him, he would take a suicide pill. 


After lengthy negotiations the Soviets finally relented and agreed to let Finnish courts conduct the trials according to Finnish laws. This meant that no one would be tortured or shot. The Finnish judge handed out prison sentences to eight politicians whom the Soviets wanted to get rid of: President Ryti, Prime Minister Rangell, Prime Minister Linkomies, Minister Tanner, Minister Ramsay, Minister Kukkonen, Minister Reinikka, and T.M. Kivimäki who had been Finland's ambassador in Nazi-Germany. Mannerheim was not charged with anything because Stalin decided that he was more useful outside of prison. He immediately moved to neutral Switzerland, far from Stalin's grasp. 


The condemned were supposed to spend a long time in prison, but after political tensions decreased, President Paasikivi began issuing pardons. By 1949 they had all been released. 


President Risto Ryti never returned to politics. He died in 1951. The Finnish government but decided to give him a state funeral even though they feared the Soviet reaction. Ryti's funeral was held a few days after Soviet tanks had rolled into Hungary. The streets were full of people and the funeral seemed almost like a patriotic protest.

5939,"I was wondering, because a report by the EU found that *violent physical* anti-Semitism was most likely to be attributed to ‘Muslim extremists’ - according to the source, page 28, ‘(...) over half (59%) of the cases of anti-Semitic violence they [the 2,700 members of the Jewish community questioned] have experienced in the past year, were perpetuated by someone with a Muslim extremist view’. The report is relatively recent (2018) and reliable (the Commission, the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights and the Institute for Jewish Policy Research were the parties involved). The report found that right-wing extremists (13%) were marginally less likely to be involved in violent physical antisemitism than left-wing extremists (17%). Of course, it is possible that Germany is different but I would want greater granularity than the article provides.
