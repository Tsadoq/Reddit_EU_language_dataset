39,"And the fact that the Western Allies would have almost certainly lost such a war.  Going to war in the 1940s against the Soviet Union in order to save Eastern Europe would have almost certainly in every historical analysis meant the loss of all of Europe. 

You also have to consider that there was no willingness among the allied powers to start another world war, how you would sell a war like this to your people, and how you would manage winning against 3-1 odds.  

Just to grasp the scope of this problem consider that the allied powers had less troops than Germany did during its invasion of the USSR in 1941, that the Soviet Union had more troops than it did in 1941, that there was hundreds of thousands more km2 to occupy than 1941 due to the Soviet's advance into Eastern Europe, that Soviet industry had all been safely relocated well beyond the range of strategic bombers, and that you had to somehow care for all the people of Europe at the same time.

I don't think people give enough consideration to the fact that Europe was starving in the years following WW2, imagine how much worse that would have been if there was another world war taking place at the same time? Do you think allied powers would be able to rely entirely on the 'good will' of saving/liberating people from the Soviets to keep order? Do you think there wouldn't be resistance movements against the foreign power that's controlling the food supply which is consistently insufficient for the people's needs?",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/d6up8a/us_army_technician_alvin_harley_of_the_9th/f0xn7wr/,MeatsimN64,1569038410

43,"In the US there is a [first sale doctrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-sale_doctrine) that allows ""reselling of trademarked products after the trademark holder put the products on the market "". Europe also has an exhaustion rule. Let me use a book as an example. You buy one from a store. Now it belongs to you and if you want you can resell it. It is easy to understand that in this case, you don't want Hachette Books to prevent you from reselling the book. 

Where the US and the EU diverges is that this exhaustion rule also applies to computer programs ([https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX%3A32009L0024](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX%3A32009L0024)) even if said program isn't tangible. 

&gt;The first sale in the Community of a copy of a program by the rightholder or with his consent shall exhaust the distribution right within the Community of that copy, with the exception of the right to control further rental of the program or a copy thereof. 

This is the European directive that is reponsible for the relevant law in France. It's also on this directive that the Court of Justice of the European Union used during the UsedSoft v. Oracle case (h[ttp://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?docid=124564&amp;doclang=EN](http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?docid=124564&amp;doclang=EN))

&gt; it does not appear from Article 4(2) of Directive 2009/24 that the exhaustion of the right of distribution of copies of computer programs mentioned in that provision is limited to copies of programmes on a material medium such as a CD‑ROM or DVD. On the contrary, that provision, by referring without further specification to the ‘sale … of a copy of a program’, **makes no distinction according to the tangible or intangible form** of the copy in question. 

So, using the European directive and the case law from the CJEU, the french TGI de Paris ruled that Valve was selling computer program hence they had to abide by the Directive 2009/24. Ebooks, digital songs don't classify as computer programs so this Directive doesn't apply. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; What about your iTunes library? 

You'll be happy to learn that there were websites where you could resell digital goods such as songs you bought from iTunes. If you're interested to learn more about the US and its first sale doctrine, check this lawsuit: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol\_Records,\_LLC\_v.\_ReDigi\_Inc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Records,_LLC_v._ReDigi_Inc). 

&gt;the copyright holders won, on the theory that it is impossible to transfer any digital file from a user's storage medium without making a copy that is controlled by copyright's ongoing ""reproduction right"", as opposed to the ""distribution right"" that is extinguished by the First Sale doctrine.

&amp;#x200B;

There's a big cognitive dissonance going on here. A big part of gamers is happy about buying cheap gamekeys from resellers like G2A and other markets that don't give any money back to the devs, resellers that also commit tax frauds. 

You also get very angry against devs moving to a platform where they get a bigger cut from any sale.

You also get randomly very angry against developpers and all you do is nuke their reviews on Steam...

If this judgement doesn't get overturned in appeal, you, as a consumer will have more powers ovre devs. Rockstar kills mod supports in GTA? Well resell your game. That'll hurt their pockets, a lot more than your useless steam reviewes. Can't refund a game because you played it for 124 minutes? Resell it. Can't refund a game because you bought it 15 days ago? Resell it. Developpers make uninteresting games that you want to get ride of as soon as you're done with it? Resell it. Prepurchase a game that devs are promising to be very good but turns out to be trash? Resell it.

Also, he first made a trip from Europe to the Spice Islands, eastward via the Indian Ocean, and then later made his famous westward voyage that brought him to the Philippines. So he did cover the entire terrain, but it was not a strict point A to point A, round-the-world trip, and it was made in two different directions. His slave, Enrique, however, was born in either Cebu or Mallaca and came to Europe with Magellan by ship. Ten years later, he then returned to both Cebu (with Magellan) and Mallaca (after Magellan died) by ship on the armada’s westward route.

288,"Hi Sebastian,

Ever since the Brexit vote I follow British news regularly and I am very surprised about the quality of British journalism. So very often have I seen politicians get away with non-answers or answers which require cognitive dissonance. E.G. “Prime Minister what are the alternative arrangements that you are proposing to the EU?” “Well, there are just too many to name them bla bla bla…” no answer, on to the next question.

I think in Germany the interview wouldn’t have gotten past the first question until the PM would have either outlined a proposal, admitted that he has no proposals or had made a complete fool of himself.

Why this strange exercise in leniency? Are the journalists afraid the politician won’t give them a second interview if they squeeze them too hard?

Also, the British government has finally sent some written proposals to Brussels but demanded that they get kept secret from their negotiating partners… -.- Is there really anyone left in the UK who believes Johnson is negotiating in good faith?",,/r/europe/comments/d5vwge/im_sebastian_payne_and_i_write_about_british/f0wsxen/,H_Marxen,1569013417

September 20th, 2019

&amp;#x200B;

If Thuringia were a state of its own, the demographic situation in that country would be extreme. Only Japan would have more people over 65 in an international comparison. Only Hong Kong, Qatar, Macau, South Korea and the United Arab Emirates would have fewer people younger than 15. And only nine Asian or African countries would have a higher male surplus. The special thing about the situation in Thuringia: All three aspects come together here, especially in the rural regions.

&amp;#x200B;

What does this do to the population that remains behind? Sociologist Katja Salomo has used the example of the eastern German federal state to examine the effects that emigration, ageing and the loss of women can have on an open society. Salomo says: ""In areas affected by this, a feeling of disadvantage, fear of relegation and insecurity is spreading"". One way to deal with this is to devalue other groups, racism and scepticism towards democracy.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Why do women in particular leave?

The Federal Institute for Population Development (BiB) announced this year that in 2017, for the first time, more people moved from western Germany to eastern Germany than vice versa. Nevertheless, East Germany lost almost a quarter of its original population after reunification. More than 3.6 million moved away. And: ""The East German Flächenländer still have migration losses among young adults between the ages of 18 and 29,"" says Nikola Sander, Research Director of the BiB.

&amp;#x200B;

Without women, social cohesion suffers.	

&amp;#x200B;

In Katja Salomo's study, the departure of women in particular also plays a role. Why do they leave? ""This is because the labour market in East Germany is structured differently from that in West Germany. West Germany is still to a greater extent a service society. Women choose these jobs much more frequently, men tend to work in industrial occupations. This means that the West German labour market is more attractive for women"". There is also evidence that they returned less frequently and founded families in West Germany more frequently than men in East Germany.

&amp;#x200B;

Never before have so few people moved from East to West Germany

What does that do to the men who stay behind?

The contribution that women make to living together is not easy to replace, explains Solomon. Women would invest more in social and neighbourly relations, they would usually organise more for the community. ""Without them, local social cohesion suffers. Especially young people and families enliven a cityscape. Without them, institutions such as schools close; sports and leisure facilities shrink. People also reacted sensitively to dilapidated buildings and vacancies, according to Salomo. ""If you only meet older people on the street, neither they feel comfortable, nor the few young people who have stayed.

&amp;#x200B;

According to the study, the feeling of being left behind and of being on the losing side\* has consequences for political culture. According to the study, racist and democratic sceptical attitudes are to be found more strongly among the people in Thuringia who feel detached. If people feel disadvantaged, it damages their self-esteem. One way to deal with this is to construct social hierarchies,"" says Katja Salomo. The people who subjectively treated each other unfairly devalued other social groups - especially refugees and immigrants - in order to enhance their own value.

&amp;#x200B;

On the one hand, these regions urgently need immigration because of the precarious demographic situation. On the other hand, this situation makes it very unlikely that people will find it easy to accept immigration.	

&amp;#x200B;

In addition, men between the ages of 25 and 45 grew up in East Germany at a time when organised right-wing extremism was spreading. At that time youth clubs were occupied by neo-Nazis, they distributed CDs in the schoolyard and right-wing extremist music events were organised. This generation grew up with a right-wing presence. Here, too, the lack of women plays a role for Katja Salomo: ""Experiences from exit programmes suggest that it is an important reason for men to leave the scene to start a family, have children, enter into a partnership. This regulation is missing.

Welcome to science.  

&gt;Antibiotics have been used since ancient times. Many civilizations used topical application of mouldy bread, with many references to its beneficial effects arising from ancient Egypt, China, Serbia, Greece and Rome. The first person to directly document the use of moulds to treat infections was John Parkinson (1567–1650). Antibiotics revolutionized medicine in the 20th century. Alexander Fleming (1881–1955) discovered modern day penicillin in 1928. After realizing the great potential there was in penicillin, Fleming pursued the challenge of how to market it and translate it to commercial use. With help from other biochemists, penicillin was finally available for widespread use.

420,"&gt; The majority of British leaders have gone partially, or wholly, through the same upbringing:  
- Born into a rich family  
- Raised by a nanny, with the parents waving at them from a distance twice a year  
- Dispatched to an expensive boarding school (i.e., Eton) as soon as possible  
- Followed by an Oxbridge education in a subject that has nothing to do with learning something useful and everything with being with the right people.  

Except for the bit about Oxbridge, this is pretty false. Johnson fits the profile, and partially Cameron, but that's about it in living memory. Going through the PMs of the last forty years:

* Johnson: As mentioned, fits the profile, and given how short political memories on reddit are is probably the main reason people think this is actually a thing. Your only 4/4, and that's if we restrict it to facts rather than insults.

* May: Daughter of a vicar, no nannies, attended state schools except for a short stint at an independent Catholic school. Did geography at Oxford. 1/4.

* Cameron: Posh family but I don't think he had a nanny (hard to check because of the story about the nanny he hired for his kids). Went to Eton, but started quite late and was still close to his parents, so not ""waving at them from a distance"". PPE at Oxford, but judging by his academic record certainly didn't coast by on schmoozing. The nearest you get to the profile other than Johnson, but not the drooling Hapsburg you seem to picture. 3/4 at most, probably more like 2.5

* Brown: Another vicar's child. Distinctly unnannied. Went to state schools. Did History at Edinburgh. So that's a zero for you, the nearest he's got to aristocracy is bonking a Hohenzollern. 0/4.

* Blair: Family was comfortable but not particularly rich or aristocratic. No nannys as far as I can tell. Did go to private boarding schools (though not Eton), though mostly learned to hate them. Law at Oxford. 2/4 at most, and while you can say what you want about the man he definitely wasn't a friend to the private schools you seem to hate so much.

* Major: Not from a wealthy background, no nannies, went to a state school, didn't attend university at all. Another 0/4.

* Thatcher: Her parents were grocers (and oddly enough, her dad was also another preacher). Again nannyless. Went to state grammar schools. Went to Oxford, but famously studied chemistry. 0.5/4.

I could go further, but I can't be bothered. Forty years is not a cutoff point chosen particularly for my benefit - you have to go a long way back even after that to find a PM who fits your fictitious profile.

...So yeah, only the Oxbridge thing is remotely true (or actually the Oxford thing, don't think we've had a PM from Cambridge since Baldwin). You can extend the same principles to other major politicians, and high-ranking civil servants for that matter Most of our leaders have not been aristocrats or plutocrats - by and large, they have come from the educated middle and upper-middle classes. They have been the product of good schools, but not necessarily elite ones. They have generally gone to elite universities, but on the basis of their own academic capabilities. And yes, lots of them have studied humanities or politics, but in the real world rather than your head, those are neither particularly useless nor surprising (politicians often studied politics, news at 11).

In all these traits, the British ""governing class"" is fairly similar to that of most other democracies - Macron and Hollande would fit in quite well in this list, while if Sarkozy and Chirac stood out it would be as being somewhat more privileged than average. Incompetence it may well be, but the brand in question is not particular at all.",,/r/europe/comments/d6rs2j/britains_leaders_did_not_understand_the_value_of/f0wfyur/,FiveStandardExcuses,1569006641

444,"&gt;In 1977, Greek archaeologist Manolis Andronikos started excavating the Great Tumulus at Aigai[23] near modern Vergina, the capital and burial site of the kings of Macedon, and found that two of the four tombs in the tumulus were undisturbed since antiquity. Moreover, these two, and particularly Tomb II, contained fabulous treasures and objects of great quality and sophistication.[24]

&gt;Although there was much debate for some years,[25] as suspected at the time of the discovery Tomb II has been shown to be that of Philip II as indicated by many features, including the greaves, one of which was shaped consistently to fit a leg with a misaligned tibia (Philip II was recorded as having broken his tibia). Also, the remains of the skull show damage to the right eye caused by the penetration of an object (historically recorded to be an arrow).[26][27]

&gt;A study of the bones published in 2015 indicates that Philip was buried in Tomb I, not Tomb II.[28] On the basis of age, knee ankylosis, and a hole matching the penetrating wound and lameness suffered by Philip, the authors of the study identified the remains of Tomb I in Vergina as those of Philip II.[28] Tomb II instead was identified in the study as that of King Arrhidaeus and his wife Eurydice II.[28] However, this latter theory had previously been shown to be false.[27]

&gt;More recent research gives further evidence that Tomb II contains the remains of Philip II.[29]

511,"&gt;I'm American, I think the current situation is unhealthy and ludicrous for the US and for Europe. It encourages US adventurism (Germany is a forward operating base for the Middle East), while infantilizing rich first world countries who have outsourced their foreign policy/defense to a country on the other side of the planet.

I agree, no one is happy with how things currently are. Some self-sufficiency would actually provide stronger allies for the US and some self-respect and less resentment from the EU.

I think if some European nations states had been able to say no to the Iraq invasion and force it, a lot of anti-Americanism (including mine, no offense) would never have existed.

&gt;UK and France are the grownups in this scenario.

I wouldn't say so. Both of those countries have their share of problems...

&gt;Now don't get me wrong, NATO and all this made plenty of sense during the Cold War, but not so much now. And there should still be an American/European alliance, but not thousands of American troops stationed permanently in Western Europe.

Right. I'm a skeptic, but even I can see the use of a common force against autocratic regimes. The Transatlantics would be delighted.

&gt;I do get irked when countries who are happy to be vassals bitch about the US so much (again, not France). How about you grow up and be big boy countries and take care of yourselves? It's so hypocritical.

Yes. Hopefully the EU army pans out, or at least each country rebuilds their defensive capabilities, as well as a stronger political backbone.

&gt;With the UK leaving, I don't understand why any Western Europeans are not strongly getting behind France right now

I'm French, and even I would be nervous for any calls to 'rally behind us'. Our politicians make terrible mistakes. Remember that the judicial system is trying to prosecute a former president for corruption in Libya, and my country has a dependent relationship with African nations. 

It's also projected to get into conflict with China in the future over Africa, so if the US is shifting against China, France may naturally join in. Natural allies in that respect, despite how much I bash the US. 

I'm a hypocrite.

It's also easier to complain from the back than lead and become open to criticism. If France leads, everyone else should make sure that they're held in check.

&gt;I do understand the reticence of Eastern Europeans.

554,"What do you mean by ""deserving"" and why would the government set criteria? Who is talking about reducing flights to New York? People are acting like the government is coming in and dragging you from an airplane, where is that coming from?

47% of passengers are within the EU. 17% is domestic. 36% is outside of the EU. So we can limit that 64% (47 + 17%) flights in some ways by giving reasonable alternatives. Nobody is taking away your flight to New York.

There are daily flights going between destinations that can be done by train. Italy already proved how improved train travel can reduce flights. Earlier, 51% of people took a plane to get from Rome to Milan. After opening up the high speed rail to better competition, the share for airplanes declined to 26%. That is a reduction of 50% and nobody got limited in their travels. Instead they got better service and better prices.

So if we increase taxes on airlines (or actually just tax them instead of subsidizing them like now....) we can pay for more rail infrastucture.

610,"For over 18 months, since the outbreak of trade hostilities, growth has been weakening, slowly but surely. In May 2018 the OECD, along with other organisations, was predicting global growth of around 4% for 2019, whereas our current forecasts are for growth of below 3%. In the first half of 2018, global investment was increasing at an annualised pace of nearly 5%, and trade over 4%. This year, the annualised growth rate of investment could slide to below 1%, with trade turning negative in the second quarter. Growth prospects have plummeted in the wake of trade and investment.

An urgent response is required, failing which we run the risk of finding ourselves stuck in a long period of low growth, the brunt of which will be felt primarily by the most vulnerable.

This is because the events of the last 18 months are not just a passing trend. The proliferation of tariffs and subsidies and the increasing unpredictability of trade policies have destroyed growth in international trade, triggering a sharp slowdown in industrial output and investments. When companies do not know what tomorrow will bring, they exercise their “wait-and-see option”. Given that an investment is a long-term commitment, they are waiting for this insidious trade war to settle down in order to know where to invest. However, when temporary uncertainty is recurrent and rooted, large amounts of investments are withheld, thereby affecting not just present day demand but also tomorrow’s growth potential and employment.",,/r/europe/comments/d6w8qb/oecd_growth_is_taking_a_dangerous_downward_turn/f0vuhb3/,JackRogers3,1568992092

613,"""You have read, seen and heard a lot about the events and protests in Hongkong  
but what you read, see, hear or post on social media are just one part of a complex social, economic and political puzzle.  
A puzzle we will solve on our own.  
And that might take time  
but we are determined to reach a peaceful, wise and reasonable solution.  


we want to note:  


*  we wholeheartedly support  the principle ""one country two systems"" that gives Hong Kong a constitutional guarantee of continued development as a free and open society, and an open economy
* Hong Kong's inhabitants have long experience with peaceful and reasonable protests ,which are on going. We dismiss the use of violence as a solution to the current situation. violence solves nothing. we trust in the principle of rule of law that has worked so well for decades.   

* The government has begun a sector wide dialogue to discuss differences of opinion and find common ground without premise, with hope of reconciliation. We truly want to discuss important issues, discontent, problems and solutions in a calm, respectful and meaningful way.  

* Hong Kong has always been resistant, innovative and reasonable society. Our people is our greatest strength and it has the wisdom and resources that are required to tackle the problems which will arise. And we will  


\*Even with this last times unrest the foundation and the institutional structure of our economy and society is strong. we are continually a safe, open, welcoming and global society with an international, strong and dynamic economy.

So it's pretty much just stalling from having a hard border.

And to be honest I'm also surprised how the hard border problem is brought up now, rather than during the Referendum campaign. This *is* what the UK voted for as part of Brexit - to be closed off from EU member states and stop free movement of people and goods - at least I think that's what most people can agree Brexit is about. RoI is an EU member state, there's going to be a border if free movement is to stop.

671,"&gt; I already told you how I am voluntarily contributing. You indirectly implied it is not enough and that military service would be expected.

If the government told you that your skill and expertise was needed to build a hospital or a school in some remote region of Latvia with food, lodging, and a wage being provided for you, would you take them up on it? Or would you scream bloody murder and have tantrum about it?

&gt;What's the point of an army, mate? :P

It's an industry that provides jobs like any other. 

&gt;Yeah - and I am. Voluntarily. As is expected.

Paying taxes isn't voluntary.

&gt;Woah, hold up there - my ancestors bled and died for a prosperous and independent Latvia because that would help their descendants.

&gt;The crux of our entire disagreement is that you believe in service for your nation for the sake of service for your nation. I believe in voluntary ''service'' to your nation for the sake of the common good and prosperity of people.

What is a nation if not its people? No one goes out to die because they love politicians and governments, they do out to die because they love their people and their nation.

&gt;Their sacrifice was so that I could live an entitled highness life and not live in a shitty authoritarian shithole like they did. If they did it all just to benefit Latvia - sorry, gramps, but I am not a hardcore nationalist.

Exactly. You're living a life better off than any of your predecessors, but there is always room for improvement. The job of each generation is to lay the foundations for an even more prosperous and peaceful society.

&gt;In Syria? Right now? Not really.

I'm a fan of Rojava myself, it seems like the best choice for the Syrian people in the long term.

&gt;I am completely supportive of people's choice to disassociate from their families if their families are fucking shitty people. Yeah - if your family are exploiting you and they are making your life worse you have complete freedom to disassociate from them.

Yeah, alright. I'll concede here.

&gt;wtf, where is it written that being Latvian means disregarding your wellbeing for the state? We're not a Nazi country where sacrifice for the greater good is codified into the social contract.

You already give up a part of your material wealth regularly in order to help your fellow countrymen. The entire point of a social contract is that you give up some of your rights in order to enjoy the benefits of a society.

&gt;You lack any kind of compassion or empathy towards me not being willing to sacrifice my life (joining the army or helping rebuilding a dictator occupied Latvia). And you are also absolutely ignoring that I already voluntarily contribute towards the common good of the Latvian people.

If given the choice between helping your countrymen at the cost of your personal wealth or comfort or not, you would definitely choose not to help. That's why you lack compassion or empathy. 

&gt;Are we talking past each other here? You're, I'm guessing, a right wing nationalist, yes?

674,"&gt; Charging extra money for the ""advance"" web check-in (standard fare only allows check-in 4 days prior to the flight date)

swiss air (going off your flair saying switzerland i presume you live bordering switzerland) only allow you to check  in 23 hours before your flight as standard. British airways is 24 hours. SAS which I previously mentioned is 24 hours.

It appears ryanair is rather one of the less consumer unfriendly airlines in that regard.

&gt;Charging extra money to re-print your boarding pass, if for some reason you need it and your flight is less than 2 hours away. This is outright scummy, and preys on weaker people. Again, the ""penalty"" for doing so is ridiculously high (20€), especially considering the costs involved (probably 0.0001€ in paper + ink)

As they, and every other modern airline, want you to use the QR code on your phone. I honestly can't remember the last time I used a paper pass. At least 3 years ago.

&gt;Charging extra money for the standard IATA cabin baggage (55 x 35 x 20 cm). Planes are designed around it, and even bloody EJ charges no premium for it (and also allows for bigger sizes, like 56 x 45 x 25cm and no weight limit)!

733,"&gt; swiss air (going off your flair saying switzerland i presume you live bordering switzerland) only allow you to check in 23 hours before your flight as standard. British airways is 24 hours. SAS which I previously mentioned is 22 hours. It appears ryanair is rather one of the less consumer unfriendly airlines in that regard.

You missed my point, as my primary complaint was the added cost for a service which is free with any other airline in the civilised world. It does not matter if the time limit is 24, 26, 48 or 23 hours, as long as it is free of charge at the airport counter or automatic check-in machines! I can bet my wage that the 4 days limit has been set by FR just on the base of the average return dates booked by their customers, to pressure them into buying the ""premium"" options in exchange for some peace of mind

&gt; As they, and every other modern airline, want you to use the QR code on your phone. I honestly can't remember the last time I used a paper pass. At least 3 years ago.

I've also been through areas of Zagreb, and while the buildings themselves were less depressing than the London ones, they were identical and went on for block and blocks.  That has a cumulative effect of dehumanization.

I believe the ""tower blocks"" in NYC you are talking about are housing projects, which would be our social housing.  These are all the same red brick, with the same windows.  However, there is a mix of building heights, and angles. That is the difference between them and the commie blocks.

The American obsession with commie blocks basically boils down to seeing so many identical buildings, which is not done here.

Woah, hold up there - my ancestors bled and died for a prosperous and independent Latvia because that would *help their descendants*. 

The crux of our entire disagreement is that you believe in service for your nation for the sake of service for your nation. I believe in voluntary ''service'' to your nation for the sake of the common good and prosperity of people. 

&gt; the very least your entitled highness can do is make sure their sacrifice does not go to waste.

Their sacrifice was so that I could live an entitled highness life and not live in a shitty authoritarian shithole like they did. If they did it all just to benefit Latvia - sorry, gramps, but I am not a hardcore nationalist.

* Perceived criminality (""*Qualitative assessment by EIU analysts*"")

Had tunnels carved out. Back then, they had primitive tools (obviously :p), interior surface so smooth. Some of it was weathered down, but not all as it protected them (ancestors) from weathering. 

I think all of this is related to stone henge. I can’t remember-ish. And stone henge isnt the original. There’s one before it. Around these times, tribes burned the deceased bodies on stacks of woods. 

We need permission to visit, if allowed, you’ll see some of the original interior (cupboards, beds, etc made from labs of rock) are still there. They found beads, etc lying there as if it was put there yesterday. 

If anyone loves a good read, I think Neil Oliver has a book on this. Even YouTube this. Not sure of name of series. I’ll check after posting this.

Another thing I learnt from Neil Oliver, if you’re waking across countryside, mountain terrain, etc and see a big mound that looks out of place. That may be a ancient burial site. Next step is to get aerial shots. Human made paths would be faint, but still noticeable. 

If you do decide to dig, be careful. These burial grounds remain undisturbed and could collapse if you mess with the structure. Hence why you need teams of specialists who have the equipment to penetrate with radar, and whole lot more

I've read the article and I see the UN methodology as useless as the one from IUCN. I doubt that there are 150 to 200 extinct species per day but I also doubt that we lost only 800 species in the last 400 years. 

&gt; Also 2.7% monitored, 1 extinction recorded per year, so maybe 35 unknown extinctions per year, 

Thats not how it works which you should know if you've read your own articles. Some species have a much higher risk than others (see comparsion land snails ((high extinction)) and sea manmals ((low extinction)) If my 2.7% monitored species doesn't have an average risk of extinction its completely useless to create an average. 

Also: The UN statement includes plants. The IUCN doesn't even have a good record of plants for their red list.

&gt; As of April 2019, fewer than 10% of known plant diversity (28,265 species of plant) was assessed on the IUCN Red List (2019.1).

Eritrea was not at war as well. Yet 20% of all migrants in 2014 were Eritreans. In 2015, 10% of refugees were Nigerians. At that point, the conflict there was almost contained.

Now, all those countries I mention have two things in common: they are at peace and they are poor, but they have continous growth of economy. Their future is not as bleak as Syria's. They are not bombed into oblivion. People are coming to get richer illegally by abusing the system.

1020,"&gt; Should the Egyptians feel bad about the pyramids because they were built on the backs of slaves?

You don't see them as monuments to slavery and human suffering? I don't know enough about the anthropology of Egypt but if their direct ancestors were the ones doing the oppression, they should feel uneasy about their history, just like Americans should feel uneasy about the transcontinental railway etc.

&gt;They also plundered Africa, but I don't see them wringing their hands in guilt.

I can't help ignorance.

&gt;That ""Nazi gold"", ill-gotten or not, is your inheritance, 

Inheritance I can't be very proud of. 

&gt;If you want to throw it away out of some misplaced sense of guilt

I'm not throwing it all away. I'm not demolishing all of Amsterdam to pave way for Corbusian commie blocks divorced from cultural heritage and history. I just disagree with terms like ""the Dutch Golden Age"" if it means that oppression and death are golden and glorious. When we see old buildings financed by slave trade and stealing resources, we should be honest about how they were financed. I will give you €10 if you ever hear anything slightly critical of Dutch history on an Amsterdam canal cruise. It's whitewashing, that's what it is. Europeans are famous for their education and philosophy, so let's cherish that and use these skills to think about our past on a serious level. 

&gt;There's something distinctly self-destructive in this new brand of European humanitarianism

You might call it self-destructive, I call it self-reflective. I'm originally Finnish so I don't have many things to regret about my ancestors and past, but I can't turn a blind eye to what other Europeans have done around the world and I certainly hope that they don't forget their history.

I am not blaming them, and neither sending them back with their family is punishment directed at them. We are punishing their parents. If their child is punished consequently because of their own decision, it's not our fault.

&gt; True. Just as taking people hostage tells police that storming the bank to arrest you does not and will not work. Ever thought about the hostages in that situation?

1067,"The co-rent thing goes for everyone else too, then. High housing prices are not at all about immigrants and the trend has been going on for ages without them. I'd never blame it on anyone else who rents a place. If anything, a simple answer to the prices is greed. All involved parties try to ""get as much out of it as they can"", which is natural as well, but a race to the top and sucks for everyone. Less people will not change that either. There's enough housing, it's just expensive.

If the concept of borders was working so well, we'd not be having this conversation at all. I'm talking from a point post-""borders didn't work so well"" and about what's going on now. Whats your plan? Shoot everyone trying to pass or who doesn't stop knocking? The people are there and more and more will come over time, there's just no denying that.

Reducing welfare is not going to solve problems. Creating useless jobs isn't and there is less demand for unskilled work, since there seemingly aren't enough of those jobs as per your description (like...they couldn't be ""taken away"" if there were enough). We need highly skilled people and no one seems to admit that the primary issue is that a lot of people simply can't do any useful stuff we actually need. They have no marketable skills or are at best filling some bullshit job we invented to keep people busy in the first place because our general ""business model"" or economy is not keeping up. Even a lot of the jobs considered for ""higher skilled"" people are bullshit and will be automated away in no time. There's no scenario in which we'll have a nice, peaceful future AND no universal basic income. Either the latter, or riots, deaths and people going nuts at each other. Immigrants or not.

If we build a fancy hospital, why would we not use it for ""the other tribe"" as well if the people using it contribute or pay to it...and in a lot of cases, yes, also to just save someone we can save. We also save our own ""useless"" people with that hospital. I just don't see value in making this type of decision based on nationality or borders anymore, it's not a useful way to do this in our time.

I think small countries offer way more opportunity to evade responsibility in a union like the EU and blocking any sort of progress, compared to the EU being one large entity without useless layers of abstraction (such as national governments and furtherdown to federal states) and people not blocking and causing unnecssary trouble because of their small nations. Taking responsibility has nothing to do with immigration. It's about feeling well, coexisting and sharing with others, the exact opposite of shutting doors which essentially means ""fuck other people"" and society overall shunning behavior violating respectful coexistence (this part works extremely well in say Japanese public - they lack in other ways). Instilling that people gain from caring about others around them is what helps and someone coming to your country won't just shit all over it if you don't treat them like scum you'd like to be gone as soon as possible.",,/r/europe/comments/d64ojy/german_experts_have_examined_juvenile_immigrants/f0v5ksh/,Kr0et,1568964870

1106,"You’re projecting. Not all Russian-speaking people occupy your territories. I certainly do not, neither does any relative or friend of mine. 

And not all territories “occupied” by those that you speak of are actually *occupied* by them - they’ve been living there for centuries without a need to know your language. 

The internal borders in USSR were artificial, not your language. USSR dissolved, and those people stayed there. Instead of granting them cultural and administrative autonomy your politicians - being the whores to the popular opinion that politicians always are - tried to *artificially* force Ukrainian language on them.  

If anybody here’s hypocritical, it’s you. You defend your language but you deny those people the right to use their own mother tongue. Whatever you say about Russia, having an authoritarian government invading neighbouring countries that it indeed does have, at least local cultural minorities are not suppressed here. For example, in Tatarstan there are two official languages and there are even Tatar schools where students are educated in Tatar language. 

Saying that Russia *as a state* occupies your territories is one thing. Making derogatory, condescending comments about *Russians* being somehow inferior o other nations is another, and that’s not cool. 

Let me remind you: you - or more likely, your parents and grandparents - had been the part of that chaos that the monster state USSR had been. Then you left and decided to build a democratic state (kudos) living off heavily subsidised Russian gas and Russian military subcontracts (no kudos here, sorry), while we stayed and had to deal with the mess. Now the mess is spreading. 

I am sorry about that. I never voted for United Russia or Vladimir Putin, and I do not support and do condemn the Russian government’s actions in Ukraine and Georgia. 

But I am not inferior to you. If you think - or say - otherwise, then, with all due respect, you may fuck yourself.

1216,"&gt; Yeah, you'd think with all those Greek people around, they'd be cooler with it. 

Well, I have two things to say about this.  There's a very strong feeling amongst many of the immigrants here that this is ""the new country"" and you leave all of that bullshit aside.  So a lot of the immigrants just ... get over things, and move on into their new life(*).  But a lot of the *kids* are into hyper-nationalism, as they get shit from the local-born kids, feel they lack a local identity, so self-identify as Italians or Greeks or Turks, etc - when  the people from those countries would call these kids Aussies (and do when they visit the ancestral homeland, I have heard many angry stories).

The second thing is that the local Greeks are really into their heritage, and being the 2nd-largest Greek city on earth, it's easy to do this in Melbourne.  The Turks aren't as numerous, so while there is a strong Turkish community here, it's not as large as the Greek one.

&gt; Especially in the Aegean/Istanbul/Asia Minor area, it's ridiculous to think we don't have a major common ancestry (not to exclude Greeks from all that obviously).


I find it weird that the world seems to be getting *more* nationalistic, not less.  



&gt; 
&gt; I don't know, it might sound a bit idealistic, but I truly believe we are all people that happened to live in this area, the borders between us seem to be very arbitrary.


Most borders are.  I'm sure nation-states have had their utility in the past, but the sooner we're a single global communal political entity the better.

(*) I had two girls in my class in High School who were best friends, wore the same clothes etc, it was like they were twins. It was cute as hell.  They both came from Cypriot families, one Greek, one Turkish.  Finally their parents meet, at parent-teacher night at the school.  they'd been looking  forward to it for weeks.  So, the families are in the same room, the fathers spot each other, the dads start yelling and waving their arms at each other.  turns out the last time they'd seen each other (they'd met before) one was in an army truck with the other soldiers in his unit, the other one was throwing grenades into the truck trying to take out the soldiers inside.  We thought there was going to be a brawl.  Suddenly the two men stop, look at each other, and are quiet. One of them (I forget which one) said ""this is the new country, yes?""  ""Yes, this is the new country""  ""Then we start again, in the new country, okay?""  They both looked at their daughters (who are crying hysterically) came up to each other, and shook hands.

Plus Iran’s economy was in the tatters from sanctions (and corruption) so Iran had no leverage to give them such a good deal.

Plus it was super messed up because Iran was actively aiding Assad in Syria and the Houthis in Yemen at the same time Obama was trying to give them a deal. Obama was actively fighting a proxy way against Iran in Syria while offering them a fantastic deal which made no sense.

Obama was very desperate to make a deal because he wanted to be the kind of US president that reached out to Iran.

Furthermore, studies have shown that telling people that climate change is a mass extinction event, or any other kind of cataclysmic terminology leads to lower interest in climate change, less interest in solving it, and increased denialism.

There’s another side to the Iran situation that not enough people see. Iran has very very low birth rates, lots of brain drain, and a very weak economy. The economy of Iran has huge problems. 

By pulling out of the deal and keeping sanctions on Iran, the economy of Iran is being hit even harder. Plus they have way less oil production, exports, or income. Nobody wants to invest in Iran.

1485,"&gt;Ah alright, you did misunderstand my earlier comment. I compared the injustice of exiling Dutch teenagers from their perspective to the injustice of letting them stay from your perspective (as you stated you thought this was not just). I argued that the injustice of forcibly exiling a teenager from their country (thus ruining their life) far outweighs the injustice of letting them stay (which is ""unfair"" in some respects but doesn't directly harm anyone). In that sense, it's an asymmetric dilemma: neither option is completely just, but the injustice on one side far exceeds the other. I understand how you got confused though.

I disagree that extraditing the kid is unjust. It's *unfortunate*, yes, but not unjust.

&gt;As for the point you were arguing about any 14-year-olds that apply for asylum here: the Dutch state isn't kidnapping any Afghan kids and forcing them to stay in the Netherlands against their will.

So, do you think parents who travel to the Netherlands to ask for asylum are kidnapping their kids?

&gt;I do agree that the fact that they have to flee the country in the first place is a tragedy, but that's on the taliban and the US dropping bombs on their houses. It's not an injustice perpetrated by the Dutch immigration office, and certainly not one that is mitigated by kicking them out again.

They are not entitled to asylum, so they weren't personally persecuted. Again, unfortunate, but not grounds for asylum. Otherwise I can point to a few dozen million more people that you would have to accept.

&gt;and certainly not one that is mitigated by kicking them out again.

The goal of the extradition is to retain the integrity of the Dutch border policy, as created by the and for the Dutch democracy. Clearly, mitigating the injustice of wars in Afghanistan is beyond the scope of the Dutch migration policy.

&gt;Allowing Afghan asylum seekers in isn't remotely comparable to forcing Dutch teenagers out of the country.

In both cases, it's teenagers being removed from their home. If you bring up ""but you can't remove teenagers from the country they grew up in!"" then you must oppose asylum for teenagers too. If you don't, then you are revealing your own argument as just an excuse. Or alternatively, you can specify why you think other concerns override that.

1536,"Er no, he certainly advocated using incapacitating gas over bombs but he supported using much more serious weapons. Look up the story of ""M Device"", a shell containing diphenylaminechloroarsine which caused uncontrollable vomiting, coughing up blood and instant, crippling fatigue. That was used, under his command, in retaliation for the use of recovered WW1 Germany gas shells by the Bolsheviks (in August 1919 in Russia (the village of Emtsa as a starting point)). Churchill wanted to use that against the tribes of Northern India, he wrong

&gt;""I am strongly in favour of using poisoned gas against uncivilised tribes

and

&gt;the objections of the India Office to the use of gas against natives are unreasonable. Gas is a more merciful weapon than [the] high explosive shell, and compels an enemy to accept a decision with less loss of life than any other agency of war

In a note to Air Marshall Tenchard, supporting the use of mustard gas, he wrote:

&gt;[he should continue] experimental work on gas bombs, especially mustard gas, which would inflict punishment upon recalcitrant natives without inflicting grave injury upon them.

Mustard gas of course not being ""tear gas"" but a nasty weapon that killed 2.5% of the victims (chlorine was about 20%) and caused anything from skin rritation via large putrid blisters to temporary blindness

A further note in 1943, he wrote to the Chiefs of Staff Committee:

&gt;In the event of the Germans using gas on the Russians, my declaration of last year of course stands. We shall retaliate by drenching the German cities with gas on the largest possible scale. We must expect their counter-measures. Is everything in readiness for this contingency both ways?

1573,"Europe had success with the nation-state model largely due to its monarchies, which acted as a kind of precursor to the idea of ""nation"". Prior to the 18th-19th century, the concept of a German people, for example, was a foreign concept. You might've been Lutheran or Catholic or Presbyterian, and you would've been ruled by such-and-such person, and that was the way it was meant to be, but nationalism as a unifying concept - based on language, culture, and geography - was an alien notion. Doubly so for the Middle East. 

The divide and conquer strategy was most certainly a factor in the relationship between the European colonial powers and their colonies, Rwanda being a prime example. However, colonialism wasn't the only element that made some regions of the world so volatile. I find reflexive thinking of this kind detrimental to solving many of the issues surrounding problems like climate change and mass migration because it is so often used to score political points against countries and peoples who bear no guilt for the sins of the past. Should we understand the history and to try and come to a better understanding of why things are the way they are? Absolutely.

1765,"&gt; Look at the fucking process done by the UK in phasing out coal and replacing it by RENEWABLE energy. Not nuclear. Renewable.

Current UK emissions (ie 6pm in the UK today) are 293 grams of CO2 per KWH. Our 22 GW of wind power is producing only 0.8 GW of electricity. Solar is still doing well but will drop to zero over the next 2 hours. 

Current German emissions are 414 grams per KWH. Their wind is doing slightly better than the UK but as they are east of the UK the sun is lower and their solar output is now low. 

Current French emissions are 69 grams per KWH because their nuclear is not dependent on the wind or sun.

The UK is now spending more than £10 billion a year supporting renewables that cannot meet the targets the UK has committed to meeting. Last year that got us 111 TWH of renewable generation, at an average of 85 grams of CO2 per KWH. The same money spent on nuclear, even at the same price as Hinkley, would have got us 200 TWH at 12 grams per KWH, and with much lower integration costs.

We can make everything a result of conflict if we try hard enough. Current EU migration east-&gt;west? It's sure as fuck result of WW2 :)

&gt; Of the exact same thing I'm arguing. No one invaded Yugoslavia, it devoured itself.

Croats might disagree about nobody invading :) Kosov was somewhat similar. Bosnia was more clusterfuck, but it wasn't rebels coming from nowhere either.

&gt; Of course there is objective good, the problem is these conflicts are not the type where evil comes to destroy your country in the form of an invading force.

Do rebels come from thin air? Either they pretend to be rebels (Ukraine) or it's local issues brewing for a loooooong time where nobody addressed them properly (Bosnia or Brexit).

&gt; Many of these conflicts do not have a side any regular person would be interested in fighting for, all you can do is get out of the crossfire.

Yet many of those could be prevented if people had a strong enough say to prevent the conflict. Good case study would be Ukraine and how literally football hooligans (with support from local oligarchs in some cases) prevented ""rebels"" from getting foothold in some cities.

Also, did you meet many Romanians while on Spain? Did you even know there are more Romanians in Spain than any other nationality? You know why this happens? Or why it's so easy for them to adapt? Of course, there are legal, fiscal and other reasons that make them come here but you might didn't even notice because their adaptation is pretty much seamless is because cultures are pretty damn fucking similar.

Jack up the pay and locals will be happy to do. If toilet cleaning was paying €10k/mo, you'd see looong queues. But when welfare pays close to shitty job... Why bother. Or just automate and remove those sad jobs for good. But bringing in cheap labour sure sounds better than solving the issue.

&gt; The cost of educating people that expand our shrinking population and will then pay into the social welfare programs is not really much higher than the cost of educating locals.

We miss on the early years when the human is formed. Parents play a big role too. You can't just take 25 year old from entirely different background  and shape him into as productive society member as you can from a clean slate.

If there was no demand, there would be no leverage to jack up the prices. Nor epic stories how hard it is to rent an apartment in desired cities.

&gt; Why would you assume that people that get educated to get a job in order for them to be allowed to stay would need welfare for decades? A baby would stop needing welfare after two decades tops.

2074,"What a lot of people are missing is that this probably refers to the more constructed version of European identity. Nowadays European is just defined as a person living on the European continent. The current definitions range from Gibraltar to Istanbul to the Caucasus mountain range (and on this subreddit also Armenia for some reason). But it hasn't always been that way as Europe as a continent isn't as easilly identifiable as for example Africa or the Americas. 

  
In antiquity Europe was used as a region of 'Greece', Greece consisted of three parts: the Pelloponnesos, the Islands and Europe. So Europe refers to roughly the area from Athens to Macedonia. These were opposed to their 'traditional enemy': Asia on the other side of the sea. Refering to the region on west coast of what is now Turkey or as a pars pro toto for the Persian empire. This also echoes the Trojan war with the 'Europeans' fighting against the 'Asians'.

&amp;#x200B;

In the Roman era these definitions kind of change and Europe isn't really a term that is used very much. But it does resurface as the name of a Roman province after the Diocletian reforms. This European province is what was also called Thrace or currently more or less the part of Turkey that is situated on the European continent. As you can see [here](https://pages.uoregon.edu/klio/maps/re/re/diocletian's%20provinces.jpg).

In the Middle ages the term Europe is also rarely used but in the West it is sometimes used as more or less a synonym for Latin Christian Europe. And iirc Charlemagne is even called the ruler of Europe. So more or less [this area](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/16/Frankish_Empire_481_to_814-en.svg) plus maybe northern Spain and the British isles. Most of the catholics lived in Charles' empire so his empire was seen as Europe. Europe at that point was then the catholic world with the helpfull parallel of the crusades fighting another Eastern enemy in Asia. This definition of Europe is ofcourse stretched east, north and west with the conversions of the Norse and Western Slavic peoples and the reconquistas in southern Europe.

Only in the 17th century do we start to to arrive at the start of our current definition of a Europe that stretches further east. At that time people start to say that there is a faint common identity that unites the Catholic, Protestant and Orthodox christians of the European continent. But are still going to draw a line.

2152,"&gt;I genuinely have to wonder if people who believe these statistics do so because they think they're actually true or because of other reasons that have more to do with personal bias than actual facts. Every single statistic puts the US ahead of just about every European country, bar Norway and Switzerland, in terms of disposable income. 
&gt;Taxes on just about everything, from VAT to car ownership, are all lower in the US than in most European countries as are living costs in general.

And? There are a lot of things money can't buy, and Europe is still far ahead of most of the world anyway on that metric.

&gt;Buying a house in the US is cheaper than in Amsterdam in all but 3 US states. And this is Amsterdam, not London or Paris. 

Amsterdam is really not comparable to the rural backwaters of the US that you included in the comparison. Try again instead of comparing apples to orange trees.. Furthermore, housing quality in Europe is generally higher than the cheap wooden prefab constructions that count as house in the US. There's more space, true. But that just means you're also car-dependent, another cost that you *have* to pay as certainly as you have to pay taxes in Europe - not so in Amsterdam.

&gt;While I fully understand that things such as working hours are higher in the US, as is crime (especially gun crime) and the US has some of the worst ghettos I've ever seen this STILL can't possibly place the US living standards lower than countries such as Estonia or Belgium where people simply don't earn enough money to live anything more than a frugal life.

Being able to walk practically wherever you want without fears of getting robbed, or just concentrating on getting better when I'm sick because I know it won't bankrupt me, really is a quality of life that I wouldn't give up for any amount of money.

Besides, you don't seem to have a good grip on the income either: [median incomes: US 34 514 Belgium 26 922 Estonia 13 719](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_income). With a typical tax rate of [20% in the USA, 40% in Belgium, 30% in Estonia](https://www1.compareyourcountry.org/taxing-wages) that can be corrected back to 43 142, 44 870, 19 598... It obviously is going to take a few more years for Estonia to rebound from under the Sovjet's thumb, but in Belgium the median family isn't financially worse off than a middle class family in the US, enjoying the benefits in the form of time, health and security, rather than consumer goods. Social security costs money, but you're acutally secure, those needs are covered, and you don't need to have a nagging fear ""I might need it for huge medical costs"" for the remaining money.

&gt;Don't get me wrong, there's lots of advantages of living in Europe over the US, which is why I personally chose to move from the US to Europe, but saying that the US has a lower quality of life than countries that are constantly teetering on the verge of financial collapse (i.e. Italy) is absolute bullshit.

State finances and quality of life are different metrics. Surely the Italian state finances can be balanced for a while by eg. stop paying back healthcare, but quality of life would decrease a lot.",Limburg,/r/europe/comments/d5yc3f/czech_republic_has_a_higher_quality_of_life_than/f0rhz12/,silverionmox,1568884050

2225,"It's also a necessity for smaller nations within the UK.

The UK is designed to maximise development in the south east of England and keep everywhere else dependent on the union. England always wins when there's a conflict of interests within the UK.

For example, in the latter half of the 18th century, Ireland's economy was booming. It was quite competitive, even to Britain. Using an unsuccessful rebellion in 1798 as pretext, the British government passed the act of Union, dissolving Ireland's national parliament. Almost instantly Ireland's economy tanked and England benefited greatly from the decline of a major competitor.

This laid the seeds for the great famine 40 years later. Of course, at this time it was convenient for Britain to sing the praises of a laissez-faire approach to managing Ireland. 

Ireland's long history of ""misfortune"" only ended when it became independent. Before then Ireland was the poorest nation in the union and the part of Ireland that stayed in the UK contained over 80% of the island's GDP.

Today, the Republic of Ireland is much richer than the North. Unlike Northern Ireland and Scotland, it's self sufficient. And it's not getting dragged out of the EU against its wishes.",Ireland,/r/europe/comments/d5uf7s/on_this_day_in_2014_scotland_voted_against/f0r8z6h/,temujin64,1568877119

In germany we used to have a conservative party, its name is CDU. Many many years ago they said they want to be the baseline for conservative voters and no other party should exist beside them that goes in a more right wing direction than them... for reasons in germany.

But now with our bundeskanzlerin they went so much more in the left wing area that the other big party in germany SPD is loosing voters and has no clue how they should identify itself. 

The vacuum because the CDU left their right wing base got filled with the AFD. All they seem to care is about the immigrants, how evil they are and several party members have connections to nazi movements. So not voteable for me. 

But if i want to vote for a party that is dealing harder with all those fake refugees i have absolutely no party to vote!

Angela Merkel should have switched partys as soon as she felt the need to be more liberal, and focus left wing ideas. That way people could still rely on the CDU if they say they want a conservative option without voting for nazis!

Our high school system is divided in three levels (well, the lowest level is also divided into more levels, but let's just say there are three). VMBO, HAVO and VWO; respectively 4, 5 and 6 years of duriation. 

After finishing VWO you are able to go to university (highest level). After HAVO you can either go to VWO or continue to College (HBO - it's kinda the same as a 3 year university bachelor but in 4 or 5 years; you can also continue to do a master at a university when you have your HBO bachelor).   
After finishing VMBO, you can either continue on HAVO or go to MBO (which kinda is like the first year of HBO but in 3 or 4 years). You can continue at HBO, usually starting in the second year after finishing this. 

At least, I believe this is how our current school system works. They change it up all the time, and it's been over ten years for me since I was in uni.",The Netherlands,/r/europe/comments/d5u7mb/of_people_with_tertiary_education_in_europe/f0r29rv/,TheAnnoyingDutchman,1568872126

But more than that, I read about things in European countries that I would never dream of dealing with here.

People seem to act like there are no advantages to the US model, that everything about it is worse.  

I am in favor of universal healthcare for moral reasons, but that is one topic that is most often misrepresented.  People in the US are going to be shocked when they find out that government run healthcare will be like... well.... government run healthcare.

2381,"&gt; people generally are expected to pay their own health care 

I understand why you don't understand all of the details, because it's really overly complicated. 

The majority of Americans get health insurance through their employer. (Poor people, uninsured children, and people over 65 have insurance from the government, although over course through three different programs). 

92-95% of people in the US have health insurance. If you don't have it through your employer, you're legally required to buy it yourself; it will be subsidized if your income is less than 400% of the poverty level (or $48,000/year for an individual).

The subsidy (which is actually a cap on the premium) depends on how far you are above the poverty level - if you are just over the poverty level (up to 133%), your premium is capped at 2% of your income. If you are at 400% ($48k), your premium is capped at 9.5% of your income. 

If you think of this as a tax rather than a health insurance, it's not that different from a European system.

The problem, though, is that it's less efficient. Even though people are legally required to have health insurance, sometimes people just don't get it. (Which is why 5-8% are not covered despite coverage being mandatory). 

But *monetarily*, the amount you pay isn't really that different than the 14% (or whatever) deducted from your salary in Germany (I lived in Germany for several years, so that's what I'm most familiar with) for health insurance. But taxation means that you can't avoid paying and thus end up uninsured.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/d5yc3f/czech_republic_has_a_higher_quality_of_life_than/f0qmv3p/,thewimsey,1568862586

2457,"TRANSLATION

The team of the new president Volodymyr Zełensky took the first step to legalize the self-proclaimed republics of Donbas.

Ukraine tentatively agreed on the so-called Steinmeier's plan to grant special status to the occupied parts of Donbass after the elections there. If the plan is not clarified in favor of Kiev, it will mean the adoption of developments pushed by Russia.

\- The law on special status enters into force temporarily at the time of elections, and ultimately - after the decision of the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (on recognition of their integrity - ed.) - said the head of the Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Wady Prystajko yesterday. The bill was adopted in 2015, but it did not enter into force, while the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics organized their own, non-recognized vote, which was further rigged.

The regulations provide for amnesty for separatists, giving areas with special status the right to appoint their own judges and prosecutors, and transforming DRL and LRL branches into legal ""people's militia."" These areas will be able to conclude cooperation agreements with Russian oblasts. This means the legalization of the DRL and the LRL, whose proclamation led in 2014 to the Ukrainian-Russian war. As a result, at least 13,000 died. people.

""**Moscow would de facto maintain control over the Donbass and thus be able to influence Ukraine's policy,""** wrote Wojciech Konończuk from the Center for Eastern Studies recently. - The effects will be dramatic. Through the elections, they will legalize the fighters and give them autonomy - says Taras Berezoweć, a Ukrainian security expert, close to the previous presidential team. - I think that there will be a public reaction awaiting those in power.

2477,"The comparison is not that direct, since the systems are so different. In many places in Europe, taxes are higher than in the US, notably lowering the median income (as that page uses disposable income for median income). Those taxes are then used to fund programs like universal health care and education.

In the US taxes are lower, but people generally are expected to pay their own health care and education. So while the median income is higher, people have to pay for medical bills and health insurances and student debts much more from their income. These costs are not accounted in the median income in the US, whereas the public health care and education is accounted in the median income in Europe.

It's worth noting also that the title of that article is ""The Poor in the US Are Richer than the Middle Class in *Much of Europe*"". But when looking at the chart based on OECD incomes, the European countries which have lower median income than US poverty rate are Hungary, Estonia, Greece, Poland, Slovakia, Portugal &amp; Czechia. This is not ""much of Europe"". Countries with median income higher than US poverty rate are Luxembourg, Norway, Switzerland, Denmark, Belgium, Sweden, Iceland, Netherlands, Finland, Germany, France, Ireland, UK, Italy, Slovenia &amp; Spain. *This* is much of Europe.

Never providing sources supporting your absurdal claims reeking of inferiority complex is indeed what distinguishes you as a poster on this subreddit. It's yet another discussion I'm attempting to have with you in here, and it's yet another like talking to a brick wall, with your claims coming straight from fantasy land, supported by nothing else but your own incoherent delusions.

&gt;None from you so far.

I also gave you my sources. Which were much better than your sources, because mine at least have clearly proven my point.

Same here! No sources, just incomprehensible fever dreams (and babbling about the other side of discussion not giving sources, while yourself providing none). That's all your posts amount to so far.

&gt;That's your problem.

No, pretty sure it's your problem, that you time and time again present an unorthodox position unsupported by scientific consensus, and then fail to convincingly defend it. The burden of proof lies on you, and so far on every single occasion I spoke to you, this burden has turned out to be too heavy for you.

&gt;Why should I? I never claimed otherwise.

Good. Then we agree that the rulers of medieval Lithuania weren't kings. Glad this absurdal discussion is over.

&gt;Good thing I'm talking about Lithuanian and not slavic then huh?

Good thing that it turns out that word roots sometimes slightly change their meaning over time, and you cannot make conclusions completely contrary to scientific consensus, because you found at a word whose root has changed its meaning over time.

&gt;The only conclusion here is your lack of reading comprehension and critical thinking.

No. They are necessary much in the sense antibiotics and vaccines are. People live without them, but it's much more preferable to have those.

Well Ireland does have the argument that Ireland did not choose Brexit, so UK choosing Brexit forces Ireland to the position that Ireland has to either breach the GFA or breach EU obligations on protecting single market. Without the backstop, Ireland has to breach something. 

If Ireland breaches EU obligations, then UK can argue UK can breach EU obligations too. If Ireland does not breach EU obligations it breaches the GFA, then UK can argue UK can breach the GFA too.

2714,"&gt;Because that's normal. A better question is why Montenegro and Serbia are slow. Its tempting to say it's because the EU is tired from expansion. Maybe most acquis chapters are ready but they're just pending EU approval? Well no, the EU publishes reports on chapter progress and there we can see that on the vast majority of chapters there simply isn't enough progress for them to be closed. 

Depends, both are slow because both authoritarians lose power the more we complete the chapters. 

&gt;I can only speculate but I think this has to do with euroskepticism. And there seems to be a lot of it in Serbia in particular. Even on this website which is Western and English speaking I see Serbs having a lot more negative stuff to say about the EU than positive.

Well we've been on the receiving end of propaganda campaigns so we take everything with a grain of salt, unlike here where theres a massive circlejerk. 

Plus, are you surprised? we're the only country the EU is actively undermining.

There is a good argument to be made that exports to the EU will slump in any Brexit scenario, but particularly so if we leave without a deal. Many companies will take direct competitiveness hit due to non-tariff barriers, including inability to access EU public tenders, geographical restrictions in terms of incorporation, regulatory misalignment, third-country quotas, administrative overhead and so on. 

As per the link in my post, our net contribution to the budget was €16.4bn which already includes our rebate of €5bn.

2810,"&gt; Because they weren't kings, that's simple.

But the other kings who were not kings from history were called kings to avoid confusion? But the Lithuanian rulers that literally were called kings were not kings? You can add tsars to that as well.

&gt; The whole institution of ""Kinghood"" makes sense if it is universally recognized by the whole Europe.

Why? What's wrong with a king being the highest rank in the feudal order? That's what they de facto were anyway.

&gt; For it to be true it needs to have a higher power confirming it, in this case either Pope of Emperor.

Why? It's just arbitrary christian narrative of the time. Well, not arbitrary. They knew what they were doing.

&gt; Lithuanian and Czech monarchs were trying to get this privilage, because it strictly meant being equal in eyes of Papacy and God to other Western European Monarch.

There's way more to it than what you mention here but I really don't know czech history and I don't feel like writing essays on the Lithuanian side. It's not that simple is all I'll say.

&gt; I understand that there is a word in Lithuanian meaning pretty much the same as English ""King"" or Polish ""Król"", but even Lithuanian monarchs recognized the difference between crowned monarch ""king"" and a Pagan derived ""ruler"".

Not during the time I'm talking about. 

&gt; We know this because first, both Vitautas and Mindaugas were aware of this difference and were trying to cross this bridge and standarize the their title to their Western contemporaries.

Not really. Mindaugas was just trying to consolidate his power and the only way the teutons agreed to help was if he took up christianity. It was pragmatism. 

Vytautas is a different topic. By that time Jogaila got crowned the only way for Vytautas to get legitimacy was to get crowned as well. Lithuania got christianized during their reign so your standard chistendom rules start applying. Vytautas starts playing by christian rules. 

&gt; The other thing is that the title itself was translated and approved by some of them. Jagiello spoke both Lithuanian and ""Russian"" and he was fine with the title of Grand Knyaz.

Of course he was. That meant that he had higher status than his cousin :)

&gt; Knyaz is also a funny word, because it means literally what you are insinuating. Knyaz was a title given to ex-pagan rulers with influence similar to western ""King"". It's not a title of shame or anything like you seem to think

I never even implied anything about shame. My point is that non-catholics (including orthodox christians) were labeled something different than kings in order to discredit them in comparison. 

That's also an interesting example. It's another word that literally means king again but it contradicts your initial statement about pre-christian kings being labeled kings to lessen confusion. Then there's an exception after exception...

&gt; Burgundiands formed an independent and powerful country, yet were never able to claim the title of kings.

2886,"France announces €5bn push for tech start-ups

President Emmanuel Macron announced on Tuesday that France has drummed up €5bn of capital from institutional investors to pour into tech companies over the next three years, as the country tries to grow more billion-euro start-ups.

France has tapped asset managers and insurers including Axa, Natixis, Aviva and Allianz, and is courting international investors, to help address one of the main obstacles to the development of its tech ecosystem: a lack of sufficient growth capital to help start-ups expand into multibillion-euro companies.

Speaking ahead of France Digitale Day, Mr Macron said in a speech on Tuesday evening at the Elysée Palace that €2bn will be invested in France-based venture capital funds focusing on late-stage investments.

The other €3bn has been pledged to global tech funds that invest in listed companies and are managed by France-based asset managers. The country is seeking to encourage global investors to set up teams in Paris in order to do this.

“Our desire is to make France the leading ecosystem in Europe,” said Cédric O, France’s minister for the digital economy, in an interview. “We want to create many more unicorns [start-ups with a value of more than €1bn] in the next few years. Today there are seven and we are targeting 25 unicorns by 2025 and companies that are worth €5bn, €10bn, €15bn.”

The amount raised by French start-ups from investors has doubled from €1.8bn in 2015 to €3.6bn last year and is on track to exceed €5bn this year, according to CB Insights. This puts it ahead of Germany but behind the UK.

France’s public investment bank Bpifrance has played an important role over the past few years in providing finance. Now the government is turning to the private sector and has mobilised French institutional investors, who are typically underinvested in venture capital. It also wants to encourage VCs to raise late-stage funds and incentivise asset managers to open teams in Paris specialised in listed technology stocks.

The announcement follows other measures by Mr Macron’s administration to boost innovation and investment in the country, including tax cuts and a special fast-track French visa to make it easier for foreigners to work there.

“The French government seems to have understood that you can’t just fund start-ups,” said Walid Khiara, a managing director at Rothschild &amp; Co. in Palo Alto. “Capital is needed across every part of the spectrum and this latest push should help ensure the next stage of growth for successful start-ups, and secondly provide more opportunities to give investors an exit.”",,/r/europe/comments/d60pae/france_announces_5bn_push_for_tech_startups/f0p3481/,Ceredigiondragon,1568826120

The second one is kind of related to the first one. The blandness off all the characters. They are all so cookie cutter, so black or white, good or bad, brave or coward. It feels so much like a generic early 90's standard action hero movie, except everyone has silly clothes and about 90% more leather than needed. All their motives are shallow and simplistic. And all that would be acceptable, if only the source material wasn't so god damn better. All those characters, Robert the Bruce, Wallace, Longshanks and Prince Edward were soooooo much more interesting and complex than the movie made them seem. They just turned into the backstabber, the flawless hero, the bad guy and the coward. The whole avenging his dead wife, and just wanting to retire in a cottage, but coming out of retirement to fight ""the baddies"", was beaten to death in 1995 already, and a bigger budget didn't make it any better. 

And speaking about the budget, the whole world looked boring. Everything was muddy and thats about it. Its medieval Britain, so its muddy. The battlefield look the same, the cities and villages look the same, the battles are just a melee with very noticeable poor choreography at times, flimsy swords...

* In the countries with big immigrant communities (even from other EU countries), the chances that an immigrant is going to get elected as an MEP are very unlikely due to poor access to education and discrimination.

That being said, there aren't that many immigrants from outside the EU that have an EU citizenship and can get elected as MEPs and even ethnic groups such as the Roma people face discrimination in their own countries.

The thing is this is all largely tied with Kosovo. As long as Serbia hangs onto it, pushing for RS independence just wouldn't work and would put Serbia in a bad spot. But if Kosovo is ever recognized by Serbia and let go, yeah, I can see RS seceding then, since we'll have a very strong argument then, Kosovo got self-determination, so should we. Though even then it's complicated. How will the Bosniak side react? How will the Croats react too? It seems logical that if RS leaves so will HB, pretty much Bosnia would lose most of its territory. Would the Bosniaks react with war? And how will the West react? They've obviously been supportive of Bosnia's integrity so far, but if RS decides to leave right after Kosovo, justifying their stance will be hard, not to mention Russia's stronger than before. Maybe they'd back the Bosniaks, pretty much encouraging another war. Or maybe they'd be fine with it, since letting us have RS and the Croats have HB is a good way to placate us and wins some goodwill, and I think even they realize that Bosnia in its current state doesn't work and is pretty much a failure. But again, this is just speculation. War is as you say a strong possibility.

3074,"The reason for this was Google News.

During the time when Google became the behemoth it is today it was generally treated very favorably by the German media which was expanding their online presences at the same time. But after Google News had gained traction the media companies realized that they were not making much money out of their online business while the income of their traditional paper business was declining. So they came up with the idea to demand money from Google's use of their media content in and for referrals from Google News and even from regular search results. Google didn't agree and declared that they were unwilling to pay anything at all and that the media companies need to make their own money from their own ads and should be happy for the traffic they get from Google.

The same discussion happened in other European countries like France, Belgium and Spain. In France the reputable news agency AFP dragged Google to court over the use of images and Google threatened to cancel Google News in France entirely and this actually happened in Spain after Spain had created a law to require search engines to pay for the use of small media snippets in the results.

In Germany however, where the media landscape is traditionally very consensual compared to Britain or the US, the media changed it's stance on Google in it's reporting 180 degrees. From now on almost everything what Google did was reported negatively and this culminated in a huge more or less coordinated scare campaign of pretty much the entire German media including the state owned TV stations against Google Street View and got the population very afraid about the issue. Trying to argue with others that Street View might even be quite useful usually triggered very irritated responses from people who were horrified how naive you were, especially if you told them that you didn't plan to have your own apparent blocked from Street View images. Due to the massive pressure Google actually started a online service where you could register your address and optionally the floor you were living in to have it blocked from all Street View images and the evening TV news told about this and how to use it. For a few years Google didn't have any Street View images for Germany while the service had already become standard in most other countries. Eventually Google started the service in Germany as well but also covering the 20 biggest cities and that's what we still have today.

3256,"&gt;It's not a matter of not implementing the result, it's asking people if they actually still want it. Just as we have MP elections every few years.

Nope, nothing like that. General election results are always implemented and are to choose who will be MP until the next election. A future general election or by-election result cannot prevent the previous result being implemented, as that has already been implemented and run its course.

&gt;It was an advisory vote, a legally guaranteed election (as most British ones are) would have resulted in the vote being annulled

Again, there is no such thing as a binding or ‘legally guaranteed’ referendum as Parliament can always amend or repeal the ‘binding’ element. If you believe Parliament can bind itself in such a way you do not sufficiently understand how our system works.

&gt;You should try and keep up with facts. A detailed study by the LSE showed the turnout for 18-24 year olds was 64%-70% and 67% for 25-39 year olds. Certainly not the 83% - 90% estimated for the oldest group of 65+ but still not unsubstantial.

Lol ‘facts’. I was referring to exit polls conducted on the day of the referendum, not some sky tweet referencing whatever from 2015. You can prefer your guess to my guess if you like; as I said, it’s irrelevant anyway as we never apply this idea to how votes work. We hold a vote, count the votes and then implement the result.

&gt;Slippery slope garbage. The 2016 vote was the second vote on Uk EU membership. By your own argument, 2016 should be rejected.

It was the first on EU membership. The EC referendum result was implemented by default, as we were already in the EC and stayed in the EC. Of course, ‘Leave’ doesn’t mean ‘Leave forever and never ever vote on this topic again’, but it does mean ‘Leave’.

There is no democratic problem at all with revisiting the topic in a future referendum or referendums, so long as the results are implemented. The problem and danger comes from accepting the precedent that democratic results do not have to be implemented. 

Ultimately there is no convoluted set of anti-democratic Continuity Remain mental gymnastics which will ever get me to accept that ‘Remain result = Remain’ and ‘Leave result = Remain’ can be democratic. Given the Leave result, we can leave and still be a democracy, or not leave and not be a democracy.",,/r/europe/comments/d5dmnk/brexit_poised_to_sweep_across_europe/f0ob5b2/,BroadSunlitUplands,1568805017

3271,"Because unlike Ireland, Scotland is a founding member of the Union, which means it has been just as involved in British internal and external affairs as England has.

When Irish people say they were oppressed by the English....post-1707 that is incorrect. Scotland was just as complicit as England in that. Also in retaining control over the American colonies (something modern Americans seem to forget when they talk about the 'oppressive English'). Scotland seems to have gone under the radar here just because of its size relative to England. 

Of course this doesn't just mean it was participant in colonialism as well. Scotland has contributed to and benefitted greatly from the Union. Indeed to this day it is noticeable. For starters, it's wealthier than Ireland, seeing as you mentioned it. It is also overrepresented proportionally in the British parliament (albeit slightly), and within the Civil service (though I can't find the article showing that right now). It also receives more funding per head than England does, and the Scottish parliament in Holyrood controls most of Scotland's internal affairs. 

Finally, I'd point out that many of the anti-Brexit arguments can equally be applied against Scottish independence. Trade? While 44% of UK trade is done with EU members, 80% of Scottish trade is done with the rest of the UK.

I don't know the details of the project because I didn't care to ask about it. It's not something that motivates me. I was more interested in the human aspects of the ordeal.

Yes, the man had a wind generator forcibly taken down in his property, through shady means. And yes, the constant visits of sharp dressed men were witnessed by many people. And yes, the man did what he did alone, through trial and error and at sometime it was efficient enough to power his house.

The man wasn't about getting rich. We're talking about someone that worked for a living his entire life and felt he could make something for his country and fellow human using the set of skills he developed in a life of hard work.

The man is in his eighties today. In my country that means being barely able to read and write and be good enough to sum your expenses by the end of the month and see how much is left. We had a right wing dictatorship here that was all about putting people in their place and keeping them there: born poor, stay poor. Born rich, stay rich.

And nobody works for free. An engineering firm charges you the bottom of your pants to review a project. I can't imagine how much to draw it up from notes scribbled on a notepad over a decade and oral description of processes.

Hydroelectric has a nasty footprint. The amount of disruption it causes in ecosystems has long been demonstrated and needs to have sound alternatives and wind is one. But research is expensive, especially whenl entering new fields, and that requires investors that do not have in mind short term profit. And that usually implies state funding.

The state is not the big bad man. That is an ugly notion that I do not care to know where it stems from. The state is everyone. The state is servant of the people. The problem with the state is usually power hungry and short minded individuals.

The takeover got shot down but not before raining down a shit storm that made everyone aware that those three players had been putting out of business every new company trying to get into ""their"" market.

With regards to capital markets.... there are numerous European stock markets, and European investors tend to invest more domestically in their own country. There is less incentive to go public in Europe. Also, the private equity industry is very weak in Europe. A lot of the reason Europe has so much bank financing is because equity markets are so weak so banks need to fill the gap for financing. But banks are much more conservative and risk adverse than equity investors making speculative investments in new companies.

Then with the General single European market, that too is highly Balkanized and has much less scale than in other countries.

It required for me to present a fully detailed description of my idea for evaluation (and pay for it!) and if it was deemed patentable I'd then pay the registry fee. On that pond I got my fingers wet. And the values were high. Not something the average person could dispense easily here.


And if you remember correctly, I clearly stated the guy went by trial and error. The man is not an engineer. He was a metal worker until he retired. My country wasn't really about educating the masses until very recently in our history; blue collar workers got basic education and then worked in the trade from the ground up.


My country has traditionally survived by building hydroelectric power plants; there's the notion that an hydroelectric is more advantageous and generates more jobs and return. When wind turbines started becoming a thing here (we're air heads here; prime land for installing those monstrosities) those who most benefit from them today were the prime detractors of it then. It took a company from another european state to move here and set the first electric windmill park to make things change. 


The notion is that if something works, don't change it and kill any threat to it as soon as possible. Opportunities coming from change are seen as threats, not something to be fostered. The *modus operandi* of my country way to do business is stuck in time and only very slowly changing. Again, interests. There are more people interested about turning my country into a vacation resort than developing industry and technology, and this is seen even on the education level, with more and more offer of tourism and tourism related education than anything else. Blue collar workers are in high demand and short offer (but that is an entirely different bag of cats!) and this will not change. Meanwhile, we are a prime exporter of highly qualified professionals, taking their degrees outside to be able to work and use their knowledge.

And if it sounds vague, it was because I was only lending one ear to that part of the conversation. I wasn't very sharp then. Haven't got that much better since, but I'm working on it.",,/r/europe/comments/d5fm5w/germany_fights_to_limit_eu_spending_in_long_term/f0nyvij/,qyrion,1568786290

They said that is even deciding to have one would spoon the markets into thinking we may leave and cause all these economic woes to hit. I repeat, this is just on deciding to hold a vote.

This never materialised. The goal posts were moved.

2/ We were told that a leave victory in the referendum would trigger an immediate recession, capital flight and businesses to leave the UK. There was even a now infamous threat from the then chancellor (a massive supporter of remain) that if the UK voted to leave, it would require an emergency  “punishment budget” with huge cuts across the entire British economy, just to try and keep our heads above the water and not utterly collapse economically.

This never materialised. The goal posts were moved.

3/ We were told that the economy is a slow beast and it takes awhile for macroeconomics to actually show as a result of national decisions. (Remember this point. It will be important later). They said that it would take about a year, but we would definitely have a recession, capital flight and businesses leaving the UK within a year of the result. The economy just had to react to it.

This never materialised. The goal posts were moved.

4/ &lt;—- you are here now.  We are told that the date OF brexit, currently October 31st, is when we will actually feel this economic Armageddon. We will have a recession, capital flight and businesses will leave the UK. The now oft used line of “U HAVENT EVEN LEFT YET” “U R STILL IN DA SINGLE MARKET” are the new battle cries of project fear and its advocates. Which is cute, but flies in basic economic text. The markets and businesses have now priced brexit into their short and long term planning. Stockpiling has taken place and contingency plans are made by most businesses that will kick in if we have a no deal. 

Now don’t get me wrong, i am NOT saying there won’t be an economic cost. I think that objectively there absolutely will be. We are not going to be as rich out of the EU as we would have been staying in. My point is so fucking what? Brexit is a political crisis which to me carried far greater costs by staying in than the money we are going to lose from leaving. And I do not think this economic cost will be as bad as project fear makes out. Here’s a few links that demonstrate in my opinion the resilience of the UK economy since the brexit vote, and why Armageddon is NOT upon us.

Exports grew faster to Canada (up 12.7%), India (31.8%) and China (15.3%) than to the EU (10%).  Goods exports were up 10%, driven by a demand for manufactured goods, while services exports rose 4.2% due to strong global interest in the UK’s prestigious financial and travel services.  Non-EU countries remain the main destination for UK services (£167.4 billion), making up 60.4% of all services exports.  The figures also reveal the trade deficit continuing to narrow over the last year by £7.7 billion to £23.1 billion.  Over the same period, the UK’s current account deficit also narrowed to £80.3 billion, down by £12.2 billion from 12 months earlier.

Montenegro is a deeply corrupt state with the same dictator for almost 30 years. In 7 years of negotiations they managed to close only 3 chapters. In a meantime they fell into Chinese debt trap, far worse than any other Western Balkans nation. Another issue is unilateral euro adoption which would need to be resolved, but there are other issues too. 

Serbia has so many issues that I don't even know where to begin. Kosovo is only one of them. Broken judicial system, non-existent environmental protection, disregard of basic human rights.

It's very questionable when and if those countries are going to close all chapters. After that happens, it takes additional two years for ratification of membership. No one knows what future brings and what is EU going to look like by then. New problems are occurring and solutions are not in sight. Population in biggest EU member states oppose future enlargement. Macron insists on EU reform but no one knows when it's going to happen. They don't want to bring in more authoritarian leaders and countries with unresolved territorial disputes.

Western Balkans is unfortunately still run by very corrupt politicians who enjoy status quo. Forces which sabotage any kind of progress are too strong. Again, I'm still very pro-EU and think they (we) don't have any viable alternative except EU, but Western Balkans is rapidly being depleted from people who can make such changes.

* Because in economical policy they define themselves as liberal after having repudiated the term 'socialdemocrats' which they used to employ at their beginnings. 

* Because they are in a alliance with a literal far-right party which got them the repudiation of center-right parties such as LREM

* Because they share many of the characteristics of populist far-right parties: flamboyant nationalism, anti-diversity (""one nation"" discourse), anti-immigration, ""technocracy""/gobierno de expertos, etc. 

* Because ever since 2016 their votes in parliament agree more with other right-wing parties (simply put, PP) than even PSOE. E.g. pensions, taxes, ..

The recession was going to happen, it is a normal part of the economic cycle and when the firing needed to happen even if ND tried to fire them they wouldn't be able to in time. Then Romania and Bulgaria joined the EU and 500,000 business left Greece because of the high taxes needed to prevent the public sector from collapsing and the pensions. The same thing will happen when Albania, NM and the rest of the Balkans join too. 

The problem wouldn't have been there in the first place if Pasok didn't lie every year about the finances. It would be like blaming Obama for the great recession just because he happened to get in at that time, every cut ND made there were massive riots and everyday borrowing rates increased for the whole world because of the global financial crisis. 

Then Papandreaou wanted to call out the EU for ND and Eurostat for cooking the books the way his party had since the '80s so that Greece would still have to buy the German and French military equipment. Their negotiating tactics just like Tsipras made the real peak of the crisis happen as they made Greece a black sheep to the EU even though they ended up doing pretty much everything that ND was going to do in 2009 anyway when Samaras got in. 

Greece is probably the only country where the center left wing party is more nationalistic and xenophobic than the center right party, like for NM in the 90's and the massive amount of anti-German and anti-American rhetoric they have created. Then Tsipras who says Syriza is the new Pasok does what ND was going to do anyway, all that populist screeching to waste time and a lot of money.

3884,"&gt;What, gambling the future of your country so that you could get reelected didn't work out too well?

What was the alternative? Hope that the public would stop wanting a referendum on the EU? 

The problem isn't that the UK eventually held a referendum, it's that the public wanted to leave. An earlier referendum on the Lisbon treaty (as the public were promised in the 2005 election) might have headed off the leave movement. Trying to hold the line against them would never have worked. 

Before the 2015 election support for a referendum in the UK was running at about 60% (with 20% opposed). How long do you think politicians could continue to ignore that? 

This is from Nick Clegg (leader of the Lib Dems, the most pro-EU party in the UK) in 2008:

*The debate about Europe has been a thorn in the side of British politics for decades. Now the wound has become infected. Europhile and Eurosceptic trading blows about the Lisbon treaty in grand rhetoric that obscures the facts. If you're pro-European, as I am, you're accused of being a sellout. If you're anti-European, like most Conservatives, you're accused of being a headbanger. It isn't new, but it isn't edifying either.*

&amp;#x200B;

*It's time we pulled out the thorn and healed the wound, time for a debate politicians have been too cowardly to hold for 30 years - time for a referendum on the big question. Do we want to be in or out? Nobody in Britain under the age of 51 has ever been asked that simple question. None of them were eligible to vote in that 1975 referendum. That includes half of all MPs. Two generations have never had their say.*

&amp;#x200B;

*I know how I'd vote. I'm unashamedly pro-European. I believe the EU is the most sophisticated response to globalisation the world has seen. In previous generations it secured peace and prosperity for Europe. In our generation, it's our only real hope in tackling global challenges like climate change, mass migration, cross-border crime and terrorism. In an increasingly insecure world, the EU offers us safety in numbers. It strengthens our real sovereignty in an age in which national borders have become increasingly meaningless.*

&amp;#x200B;

*But there are lots of people who disagree with me. Pro-Europeans have got to face up to the truth: the EU is not popular in Britain. It is perceived as distant, and is mistrusted. And some of the allegations levelled against it are hard to deny. The EU could be a lot more liberal and democratic, and the Lisbon treaty would help it to do both. So let's trust the people with the real question: in or out?*",,/r/europe/comments/d5kejm/it_didnt_work_im_sorry_david_cameron_phoned/f0mvkur/,WhiteSatanicMills,1568754104

3938,"&gt;THE EXPULSION OF SERBS FROM SLAVONIA AND SREM

&gt;In June of 1941, the Ustase were already carrying out the finer points of their plan to ""kill a third, convert a third, and expel a third"" of the Serbian population. This letter, dated June 2, 1941, concerns the ""cleansing"" of about 3,000 Serbs from the regions of Slavonia and Srem, over the border to Serbia proper. By referring to the planned disembarkation points in the precincts of Bosanska Raca and Bijeljina, this document proves that the cleansing operation was organized and planned well in advance, rather than a result of ""overzealous"" Ustase prefects.

&gt;On the 31st of May 1941. the undersigned was informed by the Ustase commissar from the main Ustase headquarters in Zagreb, Mr. Grgic Tomislav, and in agreement with the district commissariat in Bijeljina, that between the 8th and 15th of June 1941, there will be about 3,000 Serbs from the territory of Slavonia and Srem sent to Serbia over the river Drina. -The mentioned people will cross the border of the state of Croatia to Serbia on the territory of police stations Bosanska Raca and Bijeljina of this platoon.

&gt;So that the transport could be carried out undisturbed it is necessary to reinforce mentioned stations with needed number of policemen, that is with 15 more policemen at both stations, so that this way this job could be carried out undisturbed.I deliver the above for a competent decision.

source - Pavlović archives, after people from Eastern Bosnia were killed, Nazi asked for Serbs not to be killed but to relocate them to Serbia, so they ""saved"" them in a way.

&gt; Initially, the majority of the films made in the new Croatian cinema were
news and documentary films. Apart from a regular weekly newsreel, “Croatia
in Words and Pictures,” propaganda films about the Poglavnik, the new state,
and the Ustasha movement were produced. Some of these educational and
documentary films won international awards: Branko Marjanović’s expres-
sionist black-and-white drama-documentary Straža na Drini (The Guard on
the Drina), celebrating the role of the Black Legion in the “cleansing” of Eastern Bosnia from Serb communist “hordes,” won the gold medal for best documentary film at the La Biennale di Venezia in 1942.

LeU managed to enter it in 2018 but it hasn't polled above 3% since months. +EUROPA the same, it has reached a pair of peaks but seems to remain under 3%, like also all the extraparlamentary parties (Greens, Power to the People...).

This link is from pro-Erdoğan media, so you are free to ignore anything other than what the Gülenist guy said on live TV a couple of weeks before the coup. There is a video and translations are indeed correct.

Gülen's army representative was captured near the military base of the coup, allegedly looking for ""real estate"" at the night of the coup (the base is in the middle of nowhere).

And lots of statements from other Gülenists (I can confirm the authenticity of 99% evidence given here) because they were so sure that the coup would succced:

I am sick of both sides, so I think I'm going to vomit if I read more on this topic.  


&gt; When I google anything, I come up short, usually with articles showing that these claims are delusional at best.

They are masters of deception (and apparently SEO) with virtually unlimited budgets. In the links of Gülen I gave you, he is advising his disciples to be master of deception and go undercover, pretend that they are something else until they get what they want.  


&gt;That's not what the link I was responding to was saying.

I thought you can't read Turkish? That's what the article is suggesting in the text.

Giving huge hints years ago, some old videos of Gülen (in Turkish so you would have to trust my summary and translation):

Gülen urging his disciples to take over the state by infiltrating critical positions and they are free to do anything to achieve this:

and  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwwwZy2tJP4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwwwZy2tJP4)  


Gülen, answering claims that he is trying to rise into the office, says he is not that simple, he had made the plan to take over the state and rebuild another one when he was 20 years old.

&gt;The point is that in the West, soldiers joining a private group on their own volition wasn't a problem even if it was religious.

It is also the same in Turkey. The problem is when it is a secret underground organization with the aim of overthrowing democracy. Of course this wasn't a problem for Erdoğan until their clash apparently.  


&gt; In fact it's fairly civil in the sense that no one is dying and it's a  clear protest of an attempt to weaken the Kurdish language.

It is not hard to find hundreds of these if you're really looking and free of confirmation bias.  


&gt;Not in any practical sense. The US has no problem arming Kurdish groups as well as most of NATO.

I agree that this is an extreme case of hypocrisy. Officially, they declare that PKK is a terrorist organization. Undercover, they support them by arming and other manners.

Because you don't understand that any army's business is to win wars, not to look good or moral while doing it.

From a purely military standpoint, nuking soft targets - civilian population centers - is absolutely more effective for winning a war than nuking army bases and units, which really only contain expendable and replaceable men and equipment. 

If you kill 70% of your enemy's population in a few hours which will collapse their state and society within days, it's army will also effectively collapse within similar timeframes. There is really no better defence than that.

It's really amazing how after thousands of years of history of warfare most people don't know how wars really work, and think that major wars are a thing of the past. Or think like you Balts and Poles - that American tanks, missiles and nukes on your soil are reducing chances of war with Russia.

Well, a journalist should always try to verify what he is told by a random person. If he can't verify it and still wants to write that article and protect the source, he needs to make it very clear that he was unable to verify the (full) story. 

Disgruntled employees might be willing to talk about company secrets.. but they might also make them up because they are disgruntled.. Even if you unveiled who your informant is.. it would still just be something that informant told you so it doesn't really make a difference to the reader to know who it was if you weren't able to verify the story in some other way.

4209,"We don't need to look at theories for this. Currently nuclear and solar are both on the market and even before storage comes into play nuclear is generally cheaper. And part of the difficulty and time of building a nuclear plant is that its a massive bureaucratic process with politicians loving to interfere to earn political points one way or the other. The solar industry of course says they will be competitive with other power sources soon, they have a vested interest in doing so. Ask fusion researchers when commercial fusion will be here. 

Without a breakthrough somewhere storage just isn't economical. Even being generous and saying storage is 95% efficient (which comes with other disadvantages) you're still looking at a 5% increase in marginal costs plus recouping infrastructure and maintenance on those batteries. Short-term batteries could also be replaced roughly every 5-10 years meaning you need 3-6 sets of batteries for 1 nuclear plant. With the razor thin margins in the power industry storage just isn't there yet. 

And if you have a consistent baseload you don't need much variability and variability is always more expensive in the long run because you need to factor in storage and back-up power as well. If you are building a nuclear plant to support the solar farm you might as well just run the nuclear plant 24/7 at that point. Why spend money on building both when one can suffice? The capital to build both will never be recovered by trying to minimize marginal costs over the lifetime of both. The other problem is you need storage vastly beyond what is expected because if you run out things go very very wrong and you can't have a single issue risk crippling the entire grid.",,/r/europe/comments/d4z9t2/2050_is_too_late_we_must_drastically_cut/f0lz075/,demonica123,1568732927

Hol' up. I've heard this about Hungary too. There's a populist party slowly grasping ever more of Czechia, and you can hear exactly the same about Czech opposition.

The thing is, they're the *opposition*. They can't really do much. They lack the votes to push any legislature and it's very difficult for them to build good PR as they have to compete with media control and oligarch money of the populists that allows them to easily push narratives discrediting the opposition. 

Folks expect them to do miracles, fix every problem of the country with one hand and stop the populists with the other, and then call them ""useless"" when they unsurprisingly fail to do so.

Don't act like we're not a million times more efficient than people were in the past. There's just a hell of a lot more of us doing more and more things than ever before. We get up with the sun and come back in the evening to slave most our day away in some office or doing some menial shit task we all hate so we can put a roof over our heads and our families' and have something to eat just to do it again. On an individual level, having that commute be 20 minutes instead of an hour and half over the course of a lifetime is a huge fucking deal. You'll want to come spend an extra 2 hours a day with your family.
You also must be really young, but trust me man, you'll want your kids to have a yard to play in, and you'll get sick of hearing the neighbour flush the toilet in the middle of the night, or the traffic zooming by your window at 5am. That isn't natural and we've never had to live in this kind of modern hellscape that we've created. You can't put people in pods and cells and expect them to flourish. It has real effects on people.

I personally think electric cars are a very elegant answer to this personal vehicle problem. I don't see why we have to give that up for bikes or public transport.

Polish heavily discriminated against Ukrainians, including and not limited to closing their schools, tearing down their churches, resort to beating, looting, raping their women and destroy their property in [entire regions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacification_of_Ukrainians_in_Eastern_Galicia) when they opposed the Polish rule, but I've never heard about any ghettos.

4327,"&gt;  you'll get sick of hearing the neighbour flush the toilet in the middle of the night, or the traffic zooming by your window at 5am. That isn't natural and we've never had to live in this kind of modern hellscape that we've created. You can't put people in pods and cells and expect them to flourish. It has real effects on people. Depression and suicide is higher than ever, and it's very much related to our modern lifestyles.

Yes, it's not because of public transport though. Also, you wouldn't be bothered by traffic if we elimitate cars from our cities. Actually, city life could become wonderful again in many ways if we just get rid of the hellscape that is car accommodation. I know cities which have all but eliminated cars from their inner cities and trust me, they're great places to stay and raise a family. I am sorry that you don't live in one but if you want to change that getting rid of cars is part of the effort!

The Holy Roman Empire wasn't ruled by the NSDAP.

&gt;Soviet is the name for USSR, which you are clearly still refering to.

I'm not the derogative term, I'm using Soviet, as in, ruled by worker councils. Soviet is a name for council. In most territories of Ukraine and Russia and many other nations councils dominated by the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (Bolsheviks) took control.

Happy?

&gt;Could you also humor me and perhaps give some reasons for why the Bolsheviks had any rights on land held by independant nations?

Because these nations had proletarian revolutions. Ukraine was just a theatre of Reds vs Whites in the Russian Civil War. Maybe read Lenin's or Stalin's works about national self-determination:

4417,"**Did Apple evade taxes via Ireland?**

Absolutely. The schemes they used bouncing revenue declarations between Jersey and Ireland did allow them to dodge tax. Changes to the Irish tax code in 2014 closed these schemes, though companies have switched some sheltering activities to IP-based tools; Ireland now has a tax on this too, and is continuing to try and solve evasion issues. As a result, Ireland recieves drastically more corporate tax per capita than the rest of Europe, with multinationals now accounting for 70-80% of all corporate tax paid.

**Is the competition authority correct in it's ruling?**

No, at least not according to legal experts. The ruling alleges that Apple got special treatment to be able to use such a scheme, which is blatantly false, since other companies did the very same thing. It is not a competition issue, and a ruling of state aid on this point is incorrect - that's the basis of this appeal. The EU is trying to dictate what it thought Irish tax policy *should* have been over 20 years until 2014, rather than basing it's ruling on the legal reality at the time - any company could, and did, do this. The ruling alleges that 13bn in taxes should've been paid to Ireland resulting from Apple's whole-European sales. Ireland alleges that was only entitled to collect tax on Apple's *domestic* activities. 

**So why this case at all?**

Create a media shitstorm around the issue, attack Ireland's reputation as a place to do business, and spread the perception that Ireland is a tax haven. The pressure probably forced the changes made in 2014. Whether the ruling is *legally* valid (the experts on the subject seem to have concluded that it isn't), it has had huge implications for Ireland. The EU of course cannot touch member states on tax, so this abuse of the competition authority powers was the mechanism chosen. 

** What happens next? **

Years of appeals, negative press hits against Ireland, idiotic half-informed comments on social media (like this! Amazing how many foreigners are ""experts"" on the Irish corporate tax situation), academic ""reports"" ignoring Ireland's status as a genuine operational hub for European tech commercial activities and declaring those revenues to be ""phantom"". A political boost for vestager as she's seen to be chasing big corporations on tax. Right idea, but wrong execution.

Ever since, private broadcasters have had to fulfil certain obligations, usually to do with promoting culture. For instance, no films can be shown on Wednesdays, as it is traditionally the day of new cinema releases. Political pluralism must also be guaranteed. During election campaigns, broadcasters must give the same amount of airtime to the different candidates. Also, 50% of television programming must be of European origin, of which 40% must be French.
On radio stations, 35% of songs must be of Francophone origin, including African-French and Arabic-French. Advertising is also limited to 8 minutes per hour on public TV channels, and 12 minutes on private channels. The CSA's main sanction is to fine non-compliant broadcasters. Of course, many broadcasters choose to include the costs of fines in their budgets.""

4579,"Hard to describe it in english ... its mostly a mood of ""Not in my garden"", to which you can trace back the roots of of the anti nuclear energy movement in Germany. It still is a hugh problem today with the transformation to clean energy.

It is pretty much a mindset of ""I dont care, as long as I dont get affected"". For example was a nuclear power plant planned in Baden in the 1960s. The problems of the people demonstrating against it, wasnt because of nuclear waste. It was because of the steam of the plant and the possible impact on the wine. 

Nowadays the problem/mindeset is still the same. Germany want to make a transition to renewable energy. Big problem is, that most (current) renewable energy can be produced in the north of Germany, near the coast, by wind energy. But the biggest energy consumer are sitting in the south of Germany. So the government planned high voltage lines from the north to the south. Pretty much against every single one, local people are demonstrating, because they could be dangerous, or they are destroying the landscape.

4706,"&gt;Where did you get that? A roundabout is not a right before left. The traffic in it has priorities. That's reason for a roundabout. Read your own link.

No, roundabouts are not ""right before left"". The traffic in it has priority. But you do not have to stop if there is no one. You have to wait if someone is there. That's why you have sign 205 (the red triangle) at the roads connecting to the roundabout and not a stop sign.

So the road leading to the roundabout is a ""wartepflichtige zufahrt"". That's why you can have zebra crossings without that additional sign, but they grant pedestrians priority, because the lines on the road are all it needs.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Did you read your own link? Where did it declare that you don't need the signs for ""Fußgängerüberweg"" at a right before left crossing?

Probably I did read it. Although I can tell you which paragraph is for what, I cannot recite the exact wording from memory. Why do you ask? Are you more like a practical guy?

There are several ""wartepflichtige Zufahrten"". It's kind of encoded in §8(2): *""(2) Wer die Vorfahrt zu beachten hat, muss rechtzeitig durch sein Fahrverhalten, insbesondere durch mäßige Geschwindigkeit, erkennen lassen, dass gewartet wird."" (The one who have to give way needs to show with his driving style, esp. by limited Speed, that he is* ***going to wait****.""*

So there are roundabouts, roads where right before left applies, roads with stop signs or sign 205, roads which connect via a lowered curbside (§10) and that red and white cross at train crossings. See §41 StVO for a list of signs showing ""warte- und haltegebote"" (wait and stop orders)

 All of those are ""wartepflichtige"" Zufahrten.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;And no you aren't ""wartepflichtig"" you only have to make s~~h~~ure there isn't somebody else.

You perfectly explain the word ""wartepflichtig"". In case someone is there, you have to wait. If no one is there, you can just go on, but (compare §8(2)) with moderate speed.

So ""wartepflichtig"" is not ""haltepflichtig"". You can only wait if there is someone to wait for, but you have to stop (halten) even if there is no one.",,/r/europe/comments/d4hnds/in_munich_germany_32_signs_at_one_crossing/f0l3zrn/,C2512,1568697636

The UK recognises Scotland as a country within a country, that is quite plain.

There is one sovereign parliament but each country also has devolved parliament or assembly (except for England which is represented by Westminster) that may petition Westminster on matters such as the right to hold an independence vote.

The UK constitution does allow for legal referendums on independence when Westminster agrees to them, which as you state it will likely do after 2021 if Scotland presents a case for it.

The Tory party is currently controlled by people toying with fascist inspired propaganda methods and restricting the authority of parliament and openly arguing they can disregard laws, to the point where moderate Tories I know on the board of influential organizations in the Tory party, are in total despair and worried the party will disintegrate because of what *they themselves* see as far right infiltration. It'd be hilarious if this wasn't the current party of government.

As for my speculations, they are fairly moderate given that polling in NI shows rising support for unification with one recent poll showing a majority in favour, and polling in Scotland showing real risks of substantially increased support for independence if Brexit goes badly, polling in Wales this month *for the first time had less than 50% opposed to independence \[this survey assumes Brexit happens, but Wales would be able to be an EU member, so huge caveat, but even a more neutrally worded one saw only 52% opposed\]*, with support for independence having risen from \~10% in 2013, to \~20% in 2016 and 33% \[same survey as above, more neutrally worded got 24%\] this month. 

Given that these are long term trends that shows no signs of reversing, and the UK is facing a real risk of major disruption, if anything, I think 20-30 years for Scotland and NI to leave is an unrealistically long time given the current situation - in both cases there's a real chance it can happen in &lt;10. Wales will likely take longer, but depending on how badly Brexit goes it could well accelerate - as I've noted elsewhere, Brexit is like a gift-wrapped opportunity for independence supporters, who will point to each and every little problem they can blame on Brexit as a justification for independence and applying to rejoin the EU. Plaid's surveys even indicates that despite Wales voting Leave, pushing for Welsh EU membership is directly a vote-winner for independence today.

4911,"&gt;It is fully understandable, given the strategic situation in 1939, that Britain and France did not acquiesce in an alliance with Stalin. They probably rightfully believed that the allies could win and that forming an alliance with an unreliable and potentially hostile power was not in their interests; which I might add was a correct analysis by 1944/1945. 

&gt;Stalin proved himself to be unreliable by the time WWII ended, installing his network of puppet dictatorships in Eastern Europe that lasted for fifty years before they yanked themselves out of the Soviet yoke. He had no interest in peace coexistence and said as much.


You have things mixed up, Stalin offered the alliance first then the MOLOTOV Ribbentrop pact happened, after the alliance was refused and the Munich agreement happened which was a stab on the back for the Soviets. And why do you say that the Soviet Union was hostile to them, didn't you forget the Russian civil war?


&gt;You also note that over twenty million Soviet people died, making it sound as if it was a victory of the Soviet government rather than the immense sacrifices of the Soviet nations. They won it, not Stalin. In fact, he hindered the Red Army enormously when Stalin killed off his own officer corps in 1937 - which obviously hobbled the Soviet Army during the opening disastrous weeks during Operation Barbarossa and made serious strategic blunders

4967,"&gt; Radiocarbon dating of The Tollund Man indicated that he died in approximately 375–210 BC. The preserved tender soft tissues of his body are the consequence of the acid in the peat, along with the lack of oxygen underneath the surface and the cold climate of the Nordic countries. Due to the acidity of peat, bones are typically dissolved rather than preserved.


&gt;Examinations and X-rays showed that the man's head was undamaged, and his heart, lungs and liver were well preserved. The Silkeborg Museum estimated his age as approximately 40 years and height at 1.61 metres (5 ft 3 in.), a relatively short stature even for the time. It is likely that the body had shrunk in the bog.

&gt;On the initial autopsy report in 1950, doctors concluded that Tollund Man died by hanging rather than strangulation. The rope left visible furrows in the skin beneath his chin and at the sides of his neck. After a re-examination in 2002, forensic scientists found further evidence to support these initial findings. Although the cervical vertebrae were undamaged, radiography showed that the tongue was distended—an indication of death by hanging.

&gt;The stomach and intestines were examined and tests carried out on their contents. **Scientists identified the man's last meal as porridge or gruel made from grains and seeds, both cultivated and wild.** Approximately 40 kinds of seeds were identified, but the porridge was primarily composed of four types: barley, flax, false flax (Camelina sativa) and knotgrass. From the stage of digestion it was concluded that the man had eaten 12 to 24 hours prior to his death. 

&gt; In 1976, the Danish police made a fingerprint analysis, making The Tollund Man's thumbprint one of the oldest prints on record.",🇨🇦+🇬🇧 ,/r/europe/comments/d5a5bm/the_tollund_man_a_naturally_mummified_corpse_of_a/f0kpwqe/,RedditIsAFailedState,1568685080

And most people dont even know what radioactivity really is, try and ask some random people at work if they know the difference between alpha and gamma radiation. So Germany decided to stop atomic energy after Fukushima, because people are afraid. Half of all German powerplants are already shut down. And i read in the newspaper a couple of months ago that, even if the politicians would decide to allow atomic energy again, they wouldn’t build new Powerplants. They have already planned in another direction.

5258,"&gt; Why is the EU so interested in expanding to Balkan countries who’s economies are less developed than most EU nations? Does this mean a large amount of EU budget is going to be spent trying to fix these countries?

I'm obviously not the guy doing the AMA but as he's not answered, I thought you might be interested to hear some thoughts. The first reason that the EU is interested in including the western balkans is because they're European countries, and the EU is fundamentally a project of European political unity. If a nation wants to be part of the EU and is willing to meet the criteria, it should be encouraged to join.

Beyond that, there are obviously tangible benefits. It would be a drain on development funds for a time, of course, but this isn't a permanent situation. Several 2004 members are on their way to becoming net contributors very soon, which is a very quick turnaround. The western balkans would benefit immensely economically, as the 2004-2013 members have done. The people of those countries would benefit from greater economic opportunity both within and outside of their countries, and they would gain a lot of rights they don't currently have, plus stricter laws that are less vulnerable to local corruption. Current member states get a new market to sell to, the ability to create better supply lines (look at how Germany has leveraged central Europe for its manufacturing), more rights, more investment opportunities, and more people to work in our countries where unemployment is low (admittedly, this is a double-edged sword on a regional level, but it's a net positive for the EU as a whole to have people moving to where there are jobs). Note that the countries that would benefit most from the new markets and room for new supply lines are ones that could do with the boost - Greece, Italy and the northern and eastern balkans would all enjoy the accession of these countries.

Finally, there are miscellaneous benefits like increased political weight and the ability to improve intra-EU infrastructure in the most efficient ways possible (e.g. Croatia and Greece can now be linked without going through Bulgaria, Romania and Hungary). Getting rid of the gaping hole in the European map allows the entirety of Europe to be better linked together and will directly and indirectly benefit all of us.

This sounds like I'm trying to convince you of something and I'm not per se - there are reasons to be against integrating the western balkans also. I'm just saying that there are benefits in terms of economics and quality of life even in current member states, and there is an ideological reason too in that these are Europeans and if they want to join our family and are willing to work at it, we should give them the chance.",NOT in favour of tax havens,/r/europe/comments/d3n78n/hi_reddit_i_am_vladimir_bilcik_an_mep_for_the_epp/f0jrch8/,TropoMJ,1568661211

5284,"&gt;I don’t think that is hypocrisy. I don’t have to house refugees unless that is really a necessity in order to support their struggle.

It's bordering on hypocrisy to say to someone 'You must take in migrants!' while refusing to do so yourself. It doesn't even need to be anything, they could simply take an inconsequential building somewhere in the Vatican, convert it to flats, and house a few migrant families there; it would grant the Holy See some legitimacy on the issue. Even token support is better than demanding that other nations do things for you instead.

&gt;Who can guarantee that in a few decades a massive comet won’t hit Europe and that people will need to seek safety elsewhere? It is not only about protecting others, but also about protecting ourselves.

We don't have the infrastructure to support migrants ourselves, if the most powerful nations in the world can't do it then what makes you think that the less developed nations would be able to host millions of European migrants?

It is not no checks, they are moved to when you enter the Schengen are because it operates as one. Maintaining internal checks is rather unnecessary.

&gt;On the contrary, since the UK wasn't in Schengen it could block access to anyone without a valid passport or Visa. 

If they did they would face consequences when they arrived. The UK could as improve the situation by issuing ID cards like most European governments do.  Most of them also have had to travel through non-Schengen countries to get there, often multiple so it clearly isn’t as effective as you seem to think.

&gt;Had the UK been in schengen then any camp inhabitant who could scrap together enough money could have boarded a train or boat to the UK.

They could have dealt with the camp there and then rather than passing the responsibility to either authorities, that would have been much better. I would rather not have easily solvable problems like that fester in the way that it did.

&gt;Dunking problems elsewhere is exactly how those migrants got to Calais in the first place.

That is no excuse to let problems fester as long as they do.

It is not France’s problem though and that is why the French authorities didn’t want to take responsibility for so long and I absolutely despise this kind of attitude. The UK is very much part of Europe and impacted by such stuff so it would be better to just accept it.

It doesn't even need to be anything, they could simply take an inconsequential building somewhere in the Vatican, convert it to flats, and house a few migrant families there; it would grant the Holy See some legitimacy on the issue. Even token support is better than demanding that other nations do things for you instead.

Perhaps being aware that someone else can do far more and far better is the reason why they say it? I mean regardless of the reason - the Vatican can’t solve the problem, they can only give moral guidance. There is no point in targeting them over the issue.

&gt;We don't have the infrastructure to support migrants ourselves, if the most powerful nations in the world can't do it then what makes you think that the less developed nations would be able to host millions of European migrants? The only reasonable and just thing to do would be to encourage migrants to stay in their respective countries and help them build it up to our European standards.

5384,"&gt; Biogas is even more polluting than fossil fuels.

It is not.

&gt;also i have seen my fair share of hundreds of batteries tossed away instead of send to be recycled, sadly people are like that.

And why in hell makes you think batteries are the problem? The technology is not the problem, it's our habits that have to change.

&gt;Hydro is limited by location, Solar requires Sun and heat, good luck doing that in european winter. Wind isn't always 24/7 blowing, energy need storage devices, like batteries. 

So what? Like I said, you don't have to reduce fossil fuels to zero. 

Instead of watching Youtube, you should read real scientific work, like the IPCC reports. They explain how it can be done. And they show that a reduction of fossil fuels by less than two thirds is more than enough to reach the 1,5°C goal.

I'd agree that most people think that people are worse off in the UK today than they were 20 years ago but if you stick to the economic metrics you'd find that compared to 1999, homelessness is about half of what it was, unemployment is about half of what it was too, household equivalent disposable income is up, inflation and interest rates are both down. Household spending on transport is down, spending on education is down, spending on food is about the same while recreational spending is up.. Even spending on housing is only marginally up (I assume higher rental costs are offset by lower mortgage costs to some degree...). 

The issue really is that things have been quite problematic for the last decade or so, the rate of 'progress' has certainly slowed and some really core issues (especially around housing...) seem very major. The argument that the current generation can't buy a house while their parents could on a single salary strikes a chord, but ignores other factors (like higher interest rates, unemployment, single occupancy rates at the moment and so on...).

Oh, I assure you, I am in that position.

I'm not accusing Reuters of lying. Scotland's notional share of the UK deficit is 7%. That is what the GERS figures show

Scotland alone doesn't have a deficit, because it doesn't control it's own spending or revenue.

You understand this, right?

Maybe Deloitte can explain it better: [Deloitte said of GERS figures in 2017 referring to the impact on Scotland of a recent global slump in oil prices , ""Commentators suggested that, under these conditions, Scotland would struggle to operate as an independent country. However, GERS data is produced for Scotland as part of the UK - it does not model scenarios for an independent Scotland in which the Scottish government would be enabled to make its own fiscal choices""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_Expenditure_and_Revenue_Scotland#Criticisms_of_GERS)

Do you now understand?

&gt;Scotland has a devolved government which has control over how much it spends

Lmao. It controls *what the money is spent on*, not how much money is spent. Most of Scotland's budget is from a fixed fiscal transfer 9Barnett transfer) and is fixed. It must be spent.

5639,"&gt; Yes there is, after all there are island nations like Iceland and Malta who do see the advantage of it. Schengen still makes travelling more efficient than it would otherwise be and it is not just about removing passport controls, either. There is also things like databases and it means that tourists only have to apply for one visa when visiting

Carrying your passport isn't much more cumbersome than carrying an ID and sharing a joint Visa is actually a bad thing from the UK and Ireland's perspective. 

Countries liek Poland and the Baltic states that are a less desirable destination for illegal immigrants have less incentive to control their Visa applications, rich continental countries like France and Germany have to work with the eastern states since they can't conceivably check every person that could enter their country over a land border but the UK and Ireland do have the ability to check every person so have no incentive to trust other states.

&gt; They don’t, flights in the Schengen area are treated as domestic so you don’t need to get through additional passports control. There is also many ferry routes as well as a train connection which don’t usually get checked. If the UK was in Schengen, travelling from London to Paris would be no different from travailing domestically.

You don't require a passport but you do need an ID as a security check on even on intra Schengen flights. 

&gt; Implementing passport controls within the EU doesn’t do a good job at that anyway and there are many tools available within that structures to deal with the situation in an effective matter. The situation in Calais was also pretty much a UK government incompetency, that has since been dealt with.

It doesnt do a good job on the continent due to the large porous land borders but the UK is spread across two islands so has the ability to check every person that can enter the country. It makes no sense to give that up and entrust border policing to countries like Greece and Italy that have proven incapable of policing their southern borders.",,/r/europe/comments/d4xjdt/scotland_move_to_join_eu_has_to_be_seriously/f0hx7md/,Oppo_123,1568632190

5670,"&gt; If fighter command had been less successful at intercepting bombers, or had been wiped out, the Germans wouldn't have felt the need to switch to night bombing.

The Germans began night bombing even before the BoB began. They carried on throughout the battle. The scale certainly intensified as their daylight losses mounted, but night bombing was always a factor. 

&gt;No night bombing means no lost German bombers hitting London

The first attack on London happened in the afternoon of 15 August. An elite German unit, intending to attack nearby Kenley airfield, instead attacked Croydon airport. Many of the bombs hit a perfume factory outside the airport, killing 60 civilians. 

Three days later the Luftwaffe bombed Wimbledon, again in broad daylight, killing 15 civilians.

Attacks on London were always going to happen because it was the most important target in the UK. Hitler had set out his plans in a directive in 1939 that made ports and food stores the main target of the Luftwaffe once air superiority had been gained. London had the largest port, and the largest food stores, in the world.

Gaining air superiority would simply have meant more daylight and fewer night attacks on London.

&gt;which means that Hitler wouldn't have gotten distracted by pique and abandoned Eagle attack.

The Luftwaffe were pushing for permission to switch their attack to London. First, because they could no longer afford the losses they were taking, second because they believed the could force the RAF into a single decisive battle over London as it was a target that had to be defended.

&gt;Even without a successful landing, there's every chance that defeat in the air coupled with steady destruction of industrial base by German strategic bombing would have forced the UK to the negotiating table.

Yes. If they had achieved air superiority the Luftwaffe would have been able to drop a lot more bombs more accurately. Constant day and night attacks on London might have changed the outcome of the war. 

&gt;Remember, this wasn't really a 'total war' for the British at this point. There was bombing, but it was restricted to military factories and airfields.

257 British civilians were killed by bombing in July, more than 1,000 in August. This is before the Luftwaffe began the blitz on British cities. Civilians were a target from the start, although on a much smaller scale than after the Luftwaffe abandoned the attempt to destroy RAF airfields.",,/r/europe/comments/d4mutu/today_is_the_anniversary_of_the_battle_of_britain/f0hkhoy/,WhiteSatanicMills,1568624339

5673,"&gt;It doesn't matter when it come to international recognition of one country's claim

International recognition matters in other things, not in the definition of cultural or identity groups. Facts matter there.

&gt;It is not recognised as a Nordic country, so it is not one.

It is because of the facts, regardless of the ""recognition"".

&gt;That's exactly how international norms work.

Cultural or identity groups are not international norms, hence why recognition is irrelevant.

&gt;Here, some reading to learn more about the subject: http://pos-graduacao.uepb.edu.br/ppgri/files/2016/02/Finnemore-and-Sikkink.-International-Norm-Dynamics-and-Political-Change-1.pdf

Am I supposed to read through everything here or what is the point of you showing me that source? Do you claim that you have read through that source or did you just make a quick Google search and found a source that you superficially think somehow supports your position?

&gt;I could say the same about you refusing to acknowledge the purely idealised nature of the concept

What is ""purely idealised"" about this concept then?

&gt;and your persistence to want to ground it in objective reality while it belongs solely to the realm of abstract ideas.

Abstract ideas are also subject to objective reality.

&gt;Yet I do not, because I respect you.

While I thank you for that, there is no need for it. I can survive without the respect of a random person on the Internet. Lack of respect doesn't necessarily have to mean distaste of the person either.

&gt;The only one not understanding basic facts here is you.

I do understand basic facts, in fact I base my position on them, unlike you.

&gt;Yet I do not insult you.

That's mostly because deep down you understand that I am right.

&gt;Please have the same basic human decency

Human decency does not entail respect of another person, especially of a person, whose arguments are ignorant.

&gt;Yes there will be.

Recognition as you say may one day be, while the status of a Nordic country already is - this is not subject to recognition.

&gt;More thinly-veiled insults. Please stop that.

You are right now arguing for the right to produce ignorant arguments. I mean, of course you have the dry right to it, but that right does not entail my obligation to respect you for it.

&gt;I usually am able to debate things without resorting to insults.

If another person's argument is ignorant, you should be able to address that.

&gt;it makes you less angry

Why do you think I am angry?

So it’s obvious that they all got subventions if you wanna call it that way. 
Eastern Germany had some good running self sustaining factories.. mostly in coal and chemistry. 
These factories got bought by western companies after the unification.. because they know that these would be a hard competitors on the market. 
And after they bought them... WAY TOO CHEAP.. they closed them almost instantly and saved their own factories from deficits. 
The pure change from “non-profit” companies to capitalistic made a lot of people lose their jobs... but this “move” from the western companies left a lot more of people in the eastern part jobless.

5792,"Spain has the worst labor laws in Europe (probably the world)

- The worker is heavily ""protected"", that means that to fire someone you have to pay 20 days per year worked (sinde 2012). Before that, 45 days. Bussiness opt to contract the absolute minimum (abusing extra hours on already contracted personal) or make semi-fraudulent temporary contracts.

- There is what's called ""dual job market"". The old workers tend to be heavily protected by laws/contract type. The youngs are on their own, worst than in a liberal paradise (fraudulent temporary contracts again).

- The minimum wage is too high (near the median wage), meaning that is very difficult/expensive for a business to legally contract anyone without experience. Thus they ""contract"" people on the black market, that keeps being unemployed in the stats.

- The south is even worst, because it's a region with a poorer economy based in agriculture, but must abide all of the above regulations.

- The cost of starting your own business is among the highest in Europe AFAIK. You have to pay the IRS about $300/month (remind you, the median wage is about $1000/month), and then you have to pay the VAT in advance. The bureaucracy for self employed people is an absolute hell to the point that almost all of them pay around $100/montth for a [gestor!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestor).

So you might ask (and if anybody from Spain replies me you'll see): ""those things are easy to fix, why don't they?""

5884,"&gt;Nope, right before left doesn't mean you have to wait. Stop signs dictate a hold on the crossing.  
&gt;  
&gt;And ""wartepflichtige Zufahren"" would mean the special cases where you have those lines for right turns.

Double Nope.

Zebrastreifen at roundabouts do not need sign 350. But you do not have to come to a full stop at a roundabout in Germany. 

You can compare §8 StVO where you are ""wartepflichtig"". It's basically every place where you have to give way to other vehicles. §8 also declares that ""right before left"" is the default(!).

Also I think you are completely wrong on dialects.   
Croatia for instance is a country that has come out of different regions with different customs who shared the Croatian identity, by your logic our differences should have disappeared by now, yet we have major culinary differences, traditions, three main different dialects and multitudes of smaller ones.

Similar in England, Scotland and Ireland where dialects change after tens of kilometres.

5960,"&gt; Speaking Tuesday on the 80th anniversary of the end of the Battle of Wizna, Wolfgang Schaeuble recalled the “heroic defense by a few hundred against a superior force of tens of thousands of German soldiers.”

&gt;Schaeuble, a member of German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s center-right Christian Democrats, said that “in 1939 Poland became the first victim of a historically unparalleled campaign of destruction (driven by) racial ideology.”

&gt; He noted that subsequently, Poland endured widespread murder, the devastation of large parts of the country and its capital, and the eradication of Jewish life in Poland.

 No need to see TFA anymore 😉

5962,"All social systems cost the state a shit ton of money. But what about millionaires and billionaires that have so much money that they don‘t even have to work?

I‘ll make one thing clear to you: The state is not a company, the state does not have a profit motive, and the state can even make much debts without problem.

Btw the CDU also pays a shit ton of money on „Förderungen“ to companies. That money is often not put in R&amp;D, but goes into the pockets of the already rich by tricking and bonuses.

And the difference between the rich accumulating money and the poor getting money is that the poor directly spend it, so 19% of the money goes directly back to the state, and the rest is put into the economy, which in turn, is also good for the state. When the rich get money, they just keep it together with the masses of money they already have, which is so much that they can‘t even spend it. So essentially, it is taken out of the economy, making the economy slower.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/d4iy8f/unemployment_in_european_union_2004_vs_2018/f0h3isl/,-FancyUsername-,1568612125
