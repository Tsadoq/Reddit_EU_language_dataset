NATO countries never incurred the benefits of the USA's efforts until after the collapse of the Soviet Union? My answer is yes. Yours is no?

&gt;Also, you might have noticed the other countries who sent troops to Korea.

Never said they didn't.

&gt;You seriously think that if someone nukes a country, France, the UK, Germany, Italy won't get involved in the response?

Assuming there is political will -- apparently that's a big assumption for countries like Germany according to the above link -- *could* some of those countries even respond? That's genuinely in question. 

&gt;You might also want to check a map for the location of Poland and how you are going to fight there without German cooperation. because that is going to be a very difficult task to ship troops to. Not even taking into account the costs of moving all the infrastructure to Poland from Germany in the first place.

""without German cooperation"" Who gives a shit? We wouldn't ask. And you said it yourself and I agree: the USA doesn't keep huge land armies in Germany anymore. Some airbases and logistics. Just find an old air base in Poland and spend the transactional cost, probably a couple billion. Get rid of the deadweight in Germany. 

&gt;What I don't agree with is these simple arguments about costs, as if the US is forced to spent so much on their military by European countries.

Didn't ask, but didn't complain either when you get the explicit backing of the USA's strategic assets. Look, maybe NATO countries can get their militaries in order. Or better yet, if you are a fan of a federalized Europe, use it as a pretext to combine and streamline armies and further integrate the EU. But that's not happening, and the USA is stuck with a lot of deadweight at the moment.

Also the Chinese are experts at saying one thing while communicating another, because the Party's overreach realized that even words are weapons that needed to be banned and made illegal.  It explains why the Chinese, even though they are fluent and can communicate effectively still choose to communicate in ways so as to not be understood, so that one message reaches the desired target while the undesired targets get static.  

Their language evolved up around it, they have a hundred different ways to say the same thing.  And so if you're someone who likes double entendre then the languages that grew up through china would be the best for that.  

Sun Tzu was born up through the Chinese ideology and is still regarded as one of the greatest military minds on the planet.

It would explain why the average Chinese is so intelligent and rarely  muscular making shows of strength.

121,"&gt;So, if I decide to come live in your house (...)

I like how you still made that entire first argument despite my prediction that you'd make that ridiculous argument and already replying to it in my original post (""_Also, under your logic, how come I don't get to kill any person who lives within my house?_"").

You then proceeded to reply to your own argument in your 3rd segment.

&gt;So, if I decide to come live in your house, you don't have the right to evict me? After all, I'm just living in your house, not even in your body, that's clearly a lesser evil, and you don't even have the right to evict me then.

Actually equating abortion to eviction... you can't ""evict"" an unborn child without killing it. Unless I'm evicting you out of the window, you will not die from an eviction. If I cannot evict you without killing you, then I do not have the right to evict you (not without being jailed for murder, anyhow).

&gt;I can insert a syringe into your body and suck your blood, and there's nothing you would do according to your logic, because I'm a separate being and making me stop would be murder.

I can. I can make you stop without killing you. I can break your arm without killing you thus forcing you to stop, without your death. You cannot conduct an abortion without killing the child, it's the entire point of the abortion.

I just made it an issue, cell clump.

_Pro-abortion humans aren't people, they're just cell clumps._

Okay, I stated you and your kind are just cell clumps. Do I get to kill you now?

&gt;Even if they were persons, you'd have the right to make them stop as a matter of self defense.

&gt;And yes, if they're causing you bodily harm you are justified to do whatever is necessary to make them stop.

Defence, bodily harm... what, is he stabbing you with a shank he made out of shit remnants? You willingly submitted to undergo a pregnancy, knowing its results.

Abortion should be outlawed in all cases in which the mother is not in danger nor does the pregnancy does not result from rape.

Choose one country to be the Tech Hub of Europe and invest there, obviously every country will have it's own industry but one will have some form of supremacy, the same as any other industry (See: London and Finance).

That's not a fair comparison. California is a state, and Guangzhou is a city. You can't compare how united they are individually against the entirety of Europe.

A sizeable proportion of hungarian minorities are in close proximity to our borders (former territories), the revision today is not about bringing back the old kingdom, its about getting back those areas which are hugely populated by hungarians back to hungary (like southern slovakia) and if an area is not next to our borders, so it can not be annexed, we should fight for their rights and/or autonomy. I dont think there is anything disputable in this, they are driven by the same principles as your minority rights movements in the 19th century.

Also criticising our culture is very foolish from a slovakian. As much as your langauge, your culture is hugely influenced by hungarian culture&amp;langauge. 

What you did in your post is practically the same behaviour as a Hungarian nationalist, spreading your bent view of history
While trying to be smug and ""smart"" about it.

I have nothing aganist slovakia or the slovakian people, i've been there many times its a great place, my only problem is when these stupid historical ""debates"" (if you can call it that) come up.

295,"Yes, \*pats on the head* spin your national epic of heroism during WWII. Every nation, no matter how poor of a fighting record it has will find something to brag about. 

But on the whole if we look at the Central Power and the later Axis, the Austrian-Hungarian troops collapsing during the Brusilov offensive and needing Germany to bail them out during WWI only foreshadowed the  poor capabilities not Hungarian troops in WWII, when they weren't even led by the more capable Austrian officers. 

You can blame this and that, but other small nations have better track records, like the Czechoslovak Legion during the Russian Civilians War orland's heroism against the Red Army.

Edit: I see you're Italian now that I see your flair.

The main issue with Italy in particular was failed expectations. Italy did not perform spectacularly in WWI, but then nobody did, and all things considered, Italy didn't even collapse during the war, like the Russian Empire did, the Austrians were held in Northern Italy. So all in all, Italy performed rather decently in the First World War.

 Mussolini embodied some sort of resurgence to the outside observers, people expected Italy to be more effective than resorting to using poison gas against Ethiopians to eke out a victory... Jesus, as much of a piece of shit Stalin was, even he did not gas the Finns. So what the hell happened to Italy in WWII? You can't honestly give me an example of a battle with not even a thousand Italians as any sort of an example, and a hundred or so dead, in a Front that had sometimes a million casualties in a month. Italians couldn't even take out the Greeks without needing to beg for German help, which delayed Barbarossa and that alone probably negated any sort of help Italy was on the Eastern Front.

From the wiki. ""By the end of World War One 42% of the population of Pozsony spoke German as their native language, 40% Hungarian, and 15% Slovak.""

&gt;What was demographic distribution of the oh-so glorious Kingdom of Hungary that hungarian political elite tried to magyarize?

55% Hungarian, 10% German, 10% Slovak, 16% Romanian, 3% Ruthenian, 4% Serb/Croatian, the rest ""other"".

But is it really relevant, never said northern slovakia wasn't populated by slovaks outside the cities. 

&gt;magyarize?

Always this buzzword by you guys.

When slovakians had to learn Hungarian in school it was magyarization, even though they had no repercussion by the state if they were slovaks and could conduct their business with the state on their mother tongue. 

When Hungarian have to learn Slovakian in school, and in the past were stripped of their belongings, house and were deported just because they were Hungarian, and to this day can't conduct their all of their business with their state in their mother tongue and if they just get hungarian citizenship then they are stripped automatically of their slovak one isn't slovakization.

342,"Firstly. I had no interest in the U.K. having influence over other counties in Europe. I remember once when the U.K. vetoed an EU vote that all other couturiers agreed on. It was so sad. 

Secondly. I didn’t like the EU having power over the U.K. a vote to leave the EU was a vote for more freedom. 

Thirdly. The EU came up with so many stupid rules. As a materials engineer I was so annoyed they banned chrome coatings. Even though only one type was toxic. They banned all types. It made me realise the EU politicians were politicians and not scientists. 

Fourthly. All the rich people, big businesses and most politicians told us to stay. Frankly, these are the people that avoid tax, pay staff minimum wage and only care about their own bottom line. So whatever they say. The opposite is better.  

Finally. I dislike globalisation. I like each country to have its own style and culture.

As I told you before, I wrote a thesis on it, so I've read enough about Cyprus -- thanks.

&gt;But when it comes to Syria, nearly all powerful countries in the world invaded Syria during the Syrian Civil War.

Powerful. Which Turkey isn't. You invaded it simply to kill Kurds. And you know that.

&gt;Turkey you can't understand that YPG is full of PKK terrorists and Turkey have right to fighting with them.

You're aware that not all Kurds support PKK, right? And Kurds do have the right to advocate for their own country. Self-determination is a human right.It's funny how you guys deny that right to Kurds but then whine about Uyghurs in China.

&gt;Probably now you will try to play Turkey-ISIS-Oil game but it was just a Russian propaganda.

Funny, you guys love to brag about how you're best buddies with Russia. What's with Russians making propaganda now?  


  
Therefore, if you're referring to Kurds there:  


&gt; So if you have no country and trying to found a country, you can kill everyone in the region? Well, you're not a state and that won't be genocide.  

Yes. Exactly. It can be as awful as you want, but it's still not a genocide.  
Also, as I said, self-determination is a right, and people have the right to rebel against tyrannies (which seems very much like the case of Turkey's treatment to Kurds).  


&gt; C'mon man you're trying to found your own country, who cares dead Muslims, especially while they're Turk? Cool. 

You know, Kurds are mostly Muslim too. In fact the Ottoman government even used Kurds as a political tool to exterminate Christian minorities exactly because they were muslims, so I don't see your point.

""In the instance of northwestern Anatolia our resources are limited to three personal names, three theonyms, and two toponyms attested in Bronze Age cuneiform sources.

Going somewhat ahead, one can observe that none of these eight elements is demonstrably Luvian or even Luvic, and most of them defy linguistic identification.""

&amp;#x200B;

None of this written evidence i.e. the theonyms, toponyms, and personal names that are attested to the contemporaneous archeological record of Troy are linguistically Luwian or even part of a luwic group. 

So again, you are wrong. 

Homer states clearly over at least 20 times that Dardanus, son of Zeus, is the founder of Ilium (Troy) and Ilus, and Priam (King of Troy) are his descendants.

&amp;#x200B;

What does Plato say? Plato also clearly places Dardanus as the founder of ilium/Troy.  
(Plato, Laws, 702 - ca. 350 BCE )

Ovid, 100 years before Appian says clearly, Ilus is a son of Dardanus.   
(Ilus, descendant of Dardanus, had lately founded a new city (Ovid, Fasti, 6.417 - ca. 17 CE ))

Strabo, also a 100 years before Appian also places Ilus as a son of Dardanus, founder of Ilium and refers to its inhabitants as “ilians”.  
(Strabo, Geography, 13.1.25 - ca. 24 CE )

&amp;#x200B;

Illyrians are attested later than dardanians, and in the family tree, dardanians come before them, so your argument about illyrians is irrelevant anyway. The etymology for Dardanian is also Albanian (Dardhë is Albanian indo european word for pear)

The reason for the unproportional majorities is the whole 40% won - majority system. Seems undemocratic but considering that Greece uses a fairly similar system today - the party winning the most votes gets 50 more seats (out of 300) randomly - I wouldn't say that using such a sysem in the 1920s was much of a problem.

Parliament was suspended, press freedom non-existant, the military was given power over many public services, and several hundreds of political prisoners were prisoned. The reasoning for this was to prevent a political takeover by Vapsid (Vabadussõdalased - union of independence fighters.)

It is still the subject of debate whether the Vapsid were fascists or not, and whether they were planning a coup. Government documents say that the situation at that moment was similar to pre-failed communist coup, but these have been disputed as propaganda.

Whatever the actual situation, democratic order was restored in 1938 with a new constitution.

I'm sorry for that, too. I know that it's much much better now but the very nationalistic attitude still reminds many people of the C-era.

769,"&gt;Crimea WAS an independent state after breaking from Ukraine.

A break away region is not an independent state.

&gt;Lithuania - as an independent state - could theoretically do the same: merge with Latvia for example and create one state, if both Lithuania and Latvia would agree on that OR be absorbed by Poland for example, if both Lithuania and Poland would agree.

Both Lithuania and Latvia are recognised internationally as independent states, not some break away regions of some former country. And Poland did try to [absorb Lithuania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1919_Polish_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat_attempt_in_Lithuania), but thankfully it failed.

&gt;Crimea voted to be incorporated into Russia and then Russia voted to accept Crimea.

Under Russian military occupation. International law exists. Territorial integrity exists. The vote is null and void.

&gt;So you say that you supported Crimea breaking from Ukraine and becoming an independent state? Good. They did. 

You're comparing apples to oranges. Kosovars were at war with Serbs. Crimeans and Ukrainians weren't adveseries until Russia took territory with it's military presence.

&gt;It's the same as if North Ireland would vote to break away from the UK and become an independent state and you would support that...

You know there is an agreement that literally says that if someday N. Ireland wants to join Republic of Ireland, it will be free to do so?

&gt;If you support Crimea's independence, you also support their right to do whatever they want as an independent state. That's what independence means.

I support their independence. I don't support annexation by Russian Federation. Which is doing exactly what Hitler was doing. Remember what happened next? To Poland? An agressor will never be appeased.

&gt;Any chances you'd also support Vilnus area to become independent?

783,"&gt;Which wars costs hundreds of thousands of casualties and were related to NATO?

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_conflicts\_related\_to\_the\_Cold\_War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_conflicts_related_to_the_Cold_War)

Plenty of American blood and treasure on that list. And ""were related to NATO"", you say. Again, NATO formed for a very specific reason, the Soviet Union and communism, and these wars were fought against the Soviet Union and communism. When the US puts in work in Korea, spends money in Afghanistan, and gets the Soviet Union into such an arms build up that it goes broke, how does that Fulda Gap person view the deal?

Maybe the Soviet Union spontaneously combusted, and every citizen in every NATO country just magically incurs the benefit. No USA efforts there. I sincerely doubt that scenario, but I'm always open to arguments. 

&gt;I repeat again: **I agree Europe needs to spent more on defense.** I feel like this is invisible text for you or something.

It's an obvious statement. Maybe say the sky is blue in case I missed that too. So what needs to be done about it? See below. 

&gt;The point is, all those complaints about US defense spending are not there because of NATO. You can limit that without removing yourself from NATO. Just exiting NATO will not magically decrease your defense budget, since that is up the US itself. If the US wants to, they can cut their military budget right now while still being part of NATO.

If the USA defunded itself to the point of being a liability, I doubt NATO would last long. If you get one thing from this, ordinary Americans are taking a discerning look at foreign entanglements. I walk to work by a litany of problems, but hey, I paid taxes to fund all those strategic weapons that keep the USA+allies safe at night when half of those allies are liabilities. Sure, that's partly domestic politics, but it's foreign policy too. Leaving NATO, or restructuring NATO, to remove those liabilities would be a benefit to the ordinary American.

It'd mean that the printing press actually set Islamic majority back regarding literacy. Its very interesting to note that, at least in some places (like muslim Iberia), they tended to put a heavy emphasis on literacy having higher percentages of literate people than most regions of Europe.

During the day, a lot of people do not eat at all in order to see the Golden Pig, which is a tradition here in Czechia. Guess it is mostly for children. A lot of people cut an apple to see the heart of it, trying to judge how the next year will be, or pour lead into the water, judging your luck or future based on the shape of lead in the water.

&gt; Seven-year-old Prince Alemayehu was captured – along with many national treasures – in 1868. His remains are held in Windsor Castle but pleas for their return have been rebuffed   
&gt;  
&gt; In the end, Emperor Tewodros released the prisoners unharmed, then committed suicide rather than surrender. **What happened next would be described as a “deluge of fire” and one of the greatest looting orgies ever undertaken in the name of the British empire. Alemayehu, by now an orphan, was put on board the Feroze, the same ship as Holmes, who was taking back to Britain the largest haul of stolen artefacts in Ethiopia’s history. The objects went into British museums and libraries. Alemayehu became a ward of Queen Victoria and, despite his continual pleas to be returned to his homeland, he died aged 18 in England.** He was buried at Windsor Castle, where he remains. A plaque, “When I was a stranger, ye took me in,” marks his vault.   
&gt;  
&gt; Today, we can recognise Napier and his forces for the marauders that they were. We can acknowledge the imperialist arrogance that would kidnap a young boy and trumpet the achievement through newspapers and photographs. The generosity of hindsight might even explain why Alemayehu’s pleas to return home were refused. But there is no longer any excuse for that same refusal and arrogance. There is no viable [reason to continue to hold his remains hostage](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/6716921.stm). He has become, like the sacred and valuable objects still in British museums and libraries, a possession.   
&gt;  
&gt; In 2007, the then Ethiopian president [Girma Wolde-Giorgis sent Queen Elizabeth a formal request ](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1554235/Ethiopia-demands-Queen-returns-prince.html)for the return of the prince’s remains. [Alemayehu’s plight](https://richardpankhurst.wordpress.com/2007/09/03/ethiopia-asks-for-return-of-stolen-child-prince/) has been the subject of [radio plays](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01p9l1z), poems, and books. Scholars and concerned citizens have started campaigns; a young boy wrote a widely publicised letter to Tony Blair. Yet every request to the Queen or Buckingham Palace has been met with silence or refusal. Alemayehu is still trapped in the land of his kidnappers, a plaque forcing on to the narrative of his life a sentiment that he would not have chosen as his own.

I said ""killed any hope I had for having a reasonable relationship with Romania"". And it did. Apparently *neither* parties are ready but you, as expected, took it as a personal attack. It's kinda pointless having a.. ""discussion"" when you see us as your enemy and always assume the worst.

&gt; just straight out said that they do not wish a happy day for us

The worst crime in history, not wishing a happy day! If you specifically mean the 1st of Dec, we are *terribly sorry* for not being happy at the anniversary of you annexing our territory. Are we supposed to be?

&gt; the thread on /r/hungary where everyone bashed us and wished us to be annexed by Russia when they finish with Ukraine aren't those as worse

There was literally one guy writing that Russia comment. It's true that many from the Hungarian reddit community aren't very fond of Romania. And you know what, since I'm on reddit I'm less fond of Romania, too. Luckily my irl experiences are much better. Because I'm that idiot who tried to be open towards Romanians even after fucking up my family for decades, beating up my grandma in school for daring to speak Hungarian, harrassing the female members of my family and trying to murder the males under Ceausescu and let's be honest, the perpetrators were *never* punished. But despite that I always tried to be open and was called terrorist mongol scum in return. :)

&gt; Saying anything about you guys or anyone as a matter of fact on /r/romania gets you banned, a subreddit should be about having a civilised discussion not about shitting on everything and everyone

I'm glad that's a case and honestly, we are not bashing Romania as a pastime either. There was one, partically a venting thread, just on the anniversary, and that's it. Shouldn't have been? Maybe. But you and all Romanians also failed to quote any constrictuve comments from there are just circlejerking about that Russia comment. That ain't helping either.

&gt; You deserve no pity I thought you were different and didn't care about nationalistic crap, with this comment you are just playing the victim.

Are you trying to have a discussion or did we just broke up? Who wants pity and why? Different from what? I don't want you to be annexed by Russia. :D Nobody in their right mind wants a border with Russia. I'm even supporting reunification with Moldova.

I don't care about yet another Hungarian monument damaged in Transylvania, yet another Hungarian nationalist wanting back Transylvania or yet another idiot debate about place names. If that's what you call nationalistic crap. However, I am mighty tired of systematic propaganda about your history (and as as sidenote, I'm mighty tired of Poland doing that, too).

Trianon gave our territory to 9 different countries and we could reconcile the differences and move on with all of them except Romania and Slovakia. The only two countries still demonizing us in their education system, mistifying the past while happily ignoring anything not fitting the ""national myth"", and calling even your own people ""anti-Romanian"", ""xenophile"", ""traitor"" etc. if they try to be factual about it. And then making propaganda videos like this, and when errors are called out it's ""meh, who cares, Transylvania is ours, we outsmarted you"" is the argument, apparently. That's about ""having a discussion"".

Do we have extreme nationalists? Fucking yes, and I hate it. I also hate the style of some Hungarian posters. But I honestly think that this was yet once again Romanians fanning up the flames by spreading propaganda, and not the other way around. What do you think would happen if Macedonians posted about how they are the direct descendants of Alexander the Great or Russians about justifying their occupation of Crimea using myths? How would you expect others to react?

&gt;  I will not act like you, I still fucking hope our countries will forget every bitter thing and that we will stop acting like little kids. I hope you will have a nice day. 

Where am I not acting like that? I *do* hope that our countries will forget the bitterness and move on. I just don't see it happening.

&gt;Landlords own an asset which generates income. If the yield relative to the value of the house is too low, many will sell up regardless if they bought the house yesterday or 10 years ago. 

But the yield depend on when they bought. If they bought 10 years ago then the yield is enormously high. But you knew that, being the economic top mind that you no doubt are.


&gt;In fact, it's more likely a landlord will sell the longer they've been renting since they no longer need the leverage (a mortgage) to generate a return.

Great. Did they teach you at Economics school for top minds that when a landlord sells its property, it implodes á la the end of the poltergeist movie, never to enter the market again?

Not really. The infamous EU quotas, contrary to popular misconception, included only asylum-seekers from 3 relatively small countries: Iraq, Syria, Eritrea. No flood of Pakistanis or Nigerians.

If we'd been able to filter the wheat from the chaff from 2015, we could have avoided a lot of pain, upheaval and terrorism.

Rent controlled apartments often become controlled by the middle class, and new people are denied entry to the cities even if they can find work. Worst of all is that it kill off construction of new apartments.

Just remember, that you are arguing for trickle down economics. It may work under some circumstances, and I hope more people will create a culture where that is the case. However, in big cities, many people live for themselves due to adverse selection. That is a consequence of everyone wanting to live in the same popular place. The lack of space, that often can't be expanded, also make sharing extremely costly when there are so many people that want to enter.

1338,"&gt;The European Union's scientific community has already declared glyphosate to be safe. It's the politicians trying to ban it. Since you're the one talking about science, you should accept their decision on the science then, right? I'm not holding my breath though.

The World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer classified glyphosate as ""probably carcinogenic in humans"" (category 2A) based on epidemiological studies, animal studies, and in vitro studies.

The European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) classified glyphosate as causing serious eye damage and toxic to aquatic life.

The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has also concluded that substance has carcinogenic properties.

There is a reason it is being banned. There are many agrichemical and agricultural corporations that are eager to lobby, grease palms and fund ""research"" to get their products back on the shelves. We had the same dance before with asbestos, DDR and other poisons. Monstanto's Roundup belongs on that list.

&gt;You do realize that countries frequently provide food aid, right?

And that food has to be purchased from the farmers by the government or NGO using money. That money is already factored into the demand for European crops. Demand that is insufficient to warrant an increase in output. For the third time: the EU limit is not production capacity, the limit is demand. Farmers can't produce food that no one is paying for - EU isn't the USSR. Most of the time the food aid given by a country is not even grown in that country.

The reason why some countries are starving? 
War, corruption, logistics to name a few. 
Just producing food isn't enough, it has to get there where it's needed. A surplus on Europe won't magically feed starving people in some village in Africa for example. 

Just because some pesticides are banned doesn't mean there are no alternatives and by no means does it mean productivity is lower if a certain pesticide is banned. And usually when something is banned, it is for a good reason. 

What it does do is make chemical companies research ever better and safer alternatives, farmers themselves are looking into using less pesticides or more efficient use of those pesticides. They do have a cost of course.

• If you use cookies in some form, you need a cookie / personalisation banner to inform your users

• If you collect or store actual data about any users who visit your site from a EU country (like account details, personal details, etc.), you need to comply fully with the GDPR legislation affecting that data. One such example would be right to erasure ([https://gdpr-info.eu/art-17-gdpr/](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-17-gdpr/)).

I'd imagine that one reason why non-EU site owners choose to simply block EU traffic rather than allow it, is that they don't want the extra overhead in terms of data/information management and storage responsibilities (such as if you get hacked and EU data is stolen, you can be liable in an EU court).

If a significant portion of your traffic came from the EU, then it's likely worth investing in the lawyers and all the other hullabaloo to sort it out. If not, then it's a numbers game of how much revenue you generate from EU nations vs the overhead of maintaining support for them.

Jokes aside, so what vital role are the British pensioner expats in Spain playing? Furthermore, there seems to be a lack of transience connected with their station, wouldn't you agree?

And ""Polish plumber""? What about people who've worked in the Netherlands, Norway, UK, Ireland, Germany - how many is enough? What about oil rig workers - is that specialised enough to warrant the expat label? Language teachers (native English speakers wear that label in reference to themselves when in Poland, for instance)?

You say it's purely a semantic discussion like semantics don't play any role in shaping reality, or our perceptions of it. Well, from where I'm sitting - they do. If ""expat"" and ""immigrant"" were entirely interchangeable, as you imply, then you'd see them used interchangeably, which is not the case - there seems to be a clear delineation in English language press between one and the other (a delineation all too often absent, for instance, from the confused muddle of ""refugee"" vs ""migrant"").

1443,"Europe can't accept all refugees. No country nor region can accept all refugees from the world without taking a drastic toll on their own way of life or even risk collapse. A few decades ago, western countries could come to an agreement to share the load of refugees from certain wartorn areas, but today these numbers tend to include everyone, even economic migrants.

Prosperous countries accepting everyone without any conditions would only lure more people from their homeland in search for a better life and put them in grave danger from their journey. This is already becoming the case. Thus, we can either accept everyone and guarantee entry and provide assistance in arrival, or we can remove the government in power in the country where people are seeking asylum from. Both are unacceptable and unsustainable. Or we can just close the borders and ride it out, I guess? Perhaps we should rethink this.

Anyway, allowing ""charities"" to do human trafficking is not acceptable in any way, shape or form. They need to stop at once. Boarding random people and the bringing them over to a port they choose like cattle is nonsense. ""Here you go, we got some people for ya, could you take care of them?"" And if you don't comply, they'll essentially hold them hostage and pump pressure on the authorities. ""We have children here!"" - yes, yes you do, because you boarded them on a ship without any plan on what to do next, you dumb fucks.

These people are not being driven away by a natural catastrophe. Some are threatened by their government due to their race, religion or creed, some are driven away by war, but most are simple economic migrants trying to fight for a better life. I feel for them, I know what it's like, but there are many others like them, and the lavish lifestyle they see on TV is not the norm.

I feel sad that it has come to the point where I side with rightwingers like this, but we all have finite resources and we don't like our good will and charity being abused. Still, EU's borders are NOT completely closed. Every country has their own immigration policy, and if you can satisfy their demands, you can arrive at any port of entry without any hindrance.

1565,"To give some objective insight in why Serbia voted in favour of Russia about the Crimean Human Rights dispute and to clear up some false conceptions.

Namely Serbia doesn't recognise Crimea as Russian, I think everyone would agree it would be rather hypocritical if it did given our current situation. In all we support Ukraine in this dispute.

Secondly it's all political interests and geopolitics. I think anyone from the west would agree that it's not beneficial for Serbia to vote otherwise as Russia is a permanent member of the UN security council and their vote is needed especially in terms of Kosovo.

Why would Serbia, in good conscience given these circumstances, vote otherwise when almost all of the west has unanimously recognised Kosovo as an independent state.

Thirdly some have given concern that Serbia is in progress of joining the European Union but votes in favour of Russia in these sort of disputes. It's a false statement to assume we're some sort of Russian puppet and I'd like to refer back to my earlier statement, it's geopolitics. Serbia doesn't have the support of the EU but has Russian support, if this were to change so would Serbias politics towards Russia and while I very much doubt it would be hostile it would be critical.",Serbia ,/r/europe/comments/a8wb6a/how_countries_voted_in_the_un_on_a_un_resolution/ecf44l6/,Miloslolz,1545604021

1569,"What you are trying to do is very dishonest. Ukrainian's favorite response to ""Lviv isn't Ukrainian"" is to shout at Poles ""Well it wasn't yours either!"" So they try to portray it as a German city as much as possible. Even the official city website reads like cringe worthy historical revisionism.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The City Conquered by Poland. The German Lviv...  
&gt;  
&gt;...Unwilling to trust either Ukrainians or his own Polish people, he invited craftsmen and builders from Germany. Thus in the 14th and 15th centuries Lviv became virtually a German city. ..

&amp;#x200B;

Ya, I guess when he invited the German \*\*Jewish\*\* refugees its because he stopped trusting Christians too. And all the Polish merchants that lived there even before annexation just disappeared.

&gt;these family names do not sound very Polish, I think you will agree with me on that.

&amp;#x200B;

I think it is dishonest to imply that having a German family name is the same thing as being German. You also chose the German spelling of the names.  Was that a coincidence?

Jacob Weiher doesn't sound very Polish either, Jacub Wjher,  as he was known in Polish, was a Polish noble. So was  Johana Hewel (Johannes Hevelius)  (Jan Heweliusz). 

By Hepnerr I think you mean  Pawel Heppner. notice Pawel is the Polish name, and it  (house #28) was built in 1510.

Roberto Bandinelli was Italian immigrant who was a citizen of Krakow since 1618, immigrants are allowed to become Polish, No? Whatever, Bandinelli Palace (#2) was actually built by Jarosz Wedelski, it was only called Bandinelli Palace because he bought it. Also its not in this picture.

Rottendorf house #43 was built in the 17th century, not for a medieval merchant. And it is not in this picture, it is not even in the Western side.

Your picture is of the Western Side.

House #39, named the Mazanczxow House, was Built in 1714 in a late Renaissance style, and it belonged to the Baczewski family

House #29 is The Palace of Felicjan Korytkowski, together with Andreolli’s covered way. Empire style, built on the site of the House of Zimorowicz, demolished in 1790.

House of Giebl, the 2nd one in your picture from the left (#24) was built in the renaissance and remodeled in 1920.

Im not going to go trough every building but you are so wrong.

Infact most of these buildings were built during the renaissance and after not medieval times, since what ever Ruthenian city there was originally was destroyed and the one supposedly built for ""German"" merchants during the medieval times was destroyed by two large fired.

&gt;as even during the time of Khmelnitsky uprising German was still a main language of use in the city council.

&amp;#x200B;

What is ""a main"" ? Yes, it was a still a popular language, during the uprising Polish was the main language of the city. During the middle ages German was a lingua franca. Polish was a peasants language. Just like Russian nobles in the 18th century spoke French, some did not even didn't know Russian well. As Poland prospered and its language became more important even in the cities where German was dominant, Polish became spoken. In other words many city Poles were descendance from these German immigrants, so if you take city Poles in the 18th century and German speaking citizens from the 15th century they are the same group of people from different generations, even if they changed language over time. Which is why Poles can claim they built the city since it was their ancestors that did it, Besides merchants should have been bilingual. But you may disagree with my reasoning but that's fine, half of Ukraine is Russian anyway, its not like there is  such a thing as Russian speaking Ukranians right?",,/r/europe/comments/a7lxtl/christmas_on_market_square_of_lviv_ukraine_oc/ecf46gt/,MuhamAkbaralalaBOOM,1545604058

Croatia is facing huge problem of huge % of youth is leaving.

Also because of geopolitics its kinda hard to say no to EU. Serbian politicians arent driven by ideology but power, and they were never really pro EU its just in current situation you have to suck in to EU.

Belfast is a predominantly catholic city and there is no way in hell it would just be given over to this protestant state. Our agriculture industries, as I've said, are located in catholic majority areas. You would become an even greater economic burden to the mainland than you already are, and the British taxpayers would get very sick very quickly of paying your upkeep when most couldn't give a toss about you staying in the UK.

How do you assume you will get this great protestant state then? Because the process of unification does not state that if the prods want it we'll carve a bit off the north east and let them settle. You would be absolutely welcomed into a new Ireland but it is you who is choosing to make the atmosphere hostile. 

And I fucking Gaurantee you, because i'm mates with enough of them, That only about 20-25% of protestants in the north would even go along with your plan. The Hardliners. The rest would not be willing to fight the results of democracy, especially given our history and the fact that provisions would be in place to preserve the ulster Scots heritage anyway. You would look like rapid nationalistic fools and your international image would be irreparably ruined. Britain wouldn't care for you and would distance itself as soon as the violence began. Ireland would no longer be welcoming, not when you're shooting Irish folks. The thought of starting violence to get your way is a foolish one and I suggest you rethink it. If it's really such a pain to live in Ireland, move across the water. You're all British after all, you should be welcomed and treated as such...

The measure uses after-tax income vs cost of living. It's very meaningful, even more than purchasing power parity per capita

""That study does account for cost-of-living, including taxes, housing and medical costs, and is considered by researchers a more accurate reflection of poverty. For a two-adult, two-child family in California, the poverty threshold was an average of $30,000, depending on the region in the state""

and

""The SPM thresholds should
represent a dollar amount
spent on a basic set of goods
that includes food, clothing,
shelter, and utilities (FCSU),
and a small additional amount
to allow for other needs (e.g.,
household supplies, personal
care, nonwork-related transportation). This threshold should
be calculated with 5 years of
expenditure data for family
units with exactly two children
using Consumer Expenditure
Survey (CE) data, and it should
be adjusted (using a specified
equivalence scale) to reflect the
needs of different family types
and geographic differences in
housing costs.""

1733,"&gt;The only NATO war was in former Yugoslavia, which had 2 casualties.

So NATO just existed in this clean vacuum until the Yugoslav Wars? So the USA beating the Soviet Union during the Cold War didn't benefit every citizen in every NATO country? You think people in the Fulda Gap weren't happy that the USA fought proxy wars against the Soviet Union and communists around the world in some of the wars you note and bankrupted the Soviet Union in an arms race?

&gt;The fact remains that the US is the only country to call its allies to war in a NATO context after being attacked. And NATO countries went with them to Afghanistan afterwards.  
&gt;  
&gt;So when talking about the ""butcher's bill"" keep in mind that is the US picking its own wars to fight, in areas where they saw it as being in their own interest as well.

Again with the Article 5 nonsense. It doesn't require a call to war. Your countries chose to join. Full stop. 

&gt;But don't come playing the hero and try to guilt trip others over wars your country picked to fight in.

I will because it's true. Which country has contributed more blood and treasure to the common defense/common interest/international order/anti-communism/whatever you want to call it? And which countries just coast and get the free ride? Personally, I would like Trump to pull the USA out of NATO.

What's more, in Switzerland, even with its smaller scale, it still doesn't work all that great. Even assuming that the issue doesn't go slow as shit through a funnel (eg. maternity leave took a while), you *still* need politicians who have to write and implement these laws in such a way that they actually work.

I mean, can you imagine the headache if a majority of people would want to close the borders because of immigrants, and you'd have to implement that in such a way that you don't violate EU treaties? Switzerland does, because they went through it.

1899,"Text:

The traditional Christmas market is one of the great sights in any European capital at this time of year. But as with all traditions it evolves over time. A few evenings ago, I went to visit the Duomo in Milan and walked through the beautiful Christmas market in the square surrounding it. It was all there: the Christmas lights, the chalet-like huts selling warm food and drink, the fake snow. And, of course, the crash barriers. For since December 2016, when Anis Amri hijacked a truck in Berlin, shot the driver and then ploughed the vehicle into the local Christmas market (killing eleven more people) crash barriers have become a necessary feature of any European Christmas market.

I was in Milan two days after Cherif Chekatt shouted ‘Allahu Akbar’ and started shooting at people enjoying the Christmas market in the city of Strasbourg. And so Milan’s Christmas market, like every other in similar cities, was on high alert. Which furthers yet another new tradition at Europe’s Christmas markets, which is the presence of army vehicles and police and military standing around with heavy duty weapons at the ready.

It all brought to mind a point that Mark Steyn has made a number of times in recent years, which is the phenomenon one might call the ‘bollard-isation’ of public life. Earlier this year in Norway I noticed that even Oslo has a strange set of massive steel devices on both sides of the street on the popular thoroughfare of cafes, restaurants and hotels that leads up to the country’s Parliament. They began to sprout one day and after a dose of negative public comment the local authorities decided to plant flowers on the devices, making them probably the world’s most ungainly flower-pots. What could have made these huge flower-carrying vessels so necessary? Who is to say.

But as Steyn has also pointed out in his observations about ‘bollard-isation’, there is a strange paradox at work here. Whichever European city you go to these days (Britain included) all of its public buildings and major infrastructure are positively surrounded by bollards and steel barriers. Yet at the same time the governments of these countries have never taken a more lax attitude to the place where bollards or similar security might be more usefully deployed. That is along what we used to call ‘a border’.

As was demonstrated yet again last week, with most of the world’s states signing up to the disastrously loosely worded ‘Marrakech Migration pact’, most European countries are content to allow the world to arrive in their countries and only then start to work out who the arrivals might be. Or pretend to start working it out and then give up. Or go through a long and costly process at the end of which it’s all relative because the person stays anyway. That story – as I have described at length – is one of the biggest stories of our time. But it presents a challenge which Europe remains unwilling to face up to.",,/r/europe/comments/a8vi49/how_terror_changed_europes_christmas_markets/ece9nfr/,casualphilosopher1,1545582827

1906,"/u/Fulgeralbastru is taking out of his ass. Man, I could write an entire novel about how shitty the Romanian ""IT industry"" and the people working within it are, and why Romania won't have a sort of Silicon Valley anytime soon. 

First of all, most of the people working in the IT industry in Romania aren't even programmers, and from the few programmers that we have, most are shit compared with average programmers from the US, for example. If you want proof of this, it's usually enough to look at software developed by Romanians for Romanians, most of them are full of bugs, don't even work most of the time and use outdated technologies. The Vodafone iOS app for paying your bills for example, is so buggy that it constantly crashes and you have to reinstall it whenever you want to pay a new bill. 

The vast majority of people working in Romania's IT sector are actually help desk, technicians (affectionately called engineers) and managers. Let's explore each of these categories:

- The help desk people are the lowest of the low. Anyone who can put together a phrase in English and can tell their mouths apart from their asses can get hired as help desk by any multinational operating in Romania. These people are so dumb that you have to create super detailed guides (with screenshots and everything) for them on how to do the most basic of tasks and they will still not understand. 

- The ~~technicians~~, sorry, the engineers are a slightly more advanced breed of the help desk guys. They aren't geniuses however, I've seen people hired as engineers who answered on interview questions things like ""the command rm is used to rename a file in linux"". However, these guys usually get forced by their managers to get some certifications before they get a chance to screw up any environment big time. However, for most of these people, their main job is just to keep an environment that someone else has implemented up and running, sure not an easy nor trivial task, but in the same way as being a great car mechanic does not make you a great car designer, building successful start-ups is not possible with people who only have experience managing environments, not setting them up from scratch. 

- The managers are the people who manage the other three categories of people (programmers, help desk and technicians) and their technical skills usually do not extend beyond usage of Microsoft Office. Also, their business skills are extremely limited as well, as in the case of most multinationals operating in Romania, they do not have any sort of direct business interaction with the customer, but only with the branches of the same company in developed countries who actually do all of the deals with the end customer. 

So, in essence, the Romanian IT sector is just like the Indian one, just slightly more expensive and with slightly better people (the Indians are the absolute worst). Of course, there are great people in both countries (Romania and India) but those are the exceptions, not the norm. On average, an American programmer is light years ahead of any Romanian one, but of course, he also costs 6-7 times more.

&gt; Conclusions

&gt; Our results showed that, after the acute administration of a glass of MLT+ wine, levels of this indoleamine in the bloodstream change, peaking at 60 min after the intake. Noteworthy, the absorbed dietary MLT significantly counteracted the physiological decrease of the endogenous MLT in the serum. Salivary MLT slightly peaked at 45 min after MLT+ wine intake, probably because of a topical effect. Further studies are needed to elucidate the biological significance of dietary MLT in humans.

u/znacistrasno 

&gt; Protests are fairly general, cause for protests is stopping violence, free media and fair elections. The protest is called Stop the bloody shirts, alluding to attack on opposition politician Borko Stefanović while he was giving speech. Last week, there was attempted murder on journalist Milan Jovanović by burning his house down and firing shots in attempt to prevent him to leave. 

&gt;Talking about media, for example in last presidential elections, Aleksandar  Vučić (current president) had over 80% of time on TV (the rest 20% was shared by all other candidates combined). There was also no direct confrontation between Vučić and any of the opposing candidates in form of TV duel or something like that.

&gt;Going from previous point, elections are rigged. Besides media manipulation, there is a lot of vote buying, intimidation and bribery of other sorts (for example, people who gather votes, can get or lose job based on their performance). There are double voter lists, where members of Srpska Napredna Stranka check who voted/didn't vote, independent observers and observers from other parties are restricted etc.

&gt;The biggest issue is that there is no political opposition figure to rally behind, so these protests are very general. Slogan of last night protest was 1 in 5 million, referring to Vučić's statement that even if 5 millions of us gathered, he wouldn't fulfill any of our demands.

2204,"It's great in the sense that women enjoying playing football get to play football. Of course no one sane would (or should) want to prevent women from chasing a ball around a field.

But the recent years' political drive and focus on women's football, salaries for women in football, lack of viewers etc. is ridiculous. It's football at an appallingly bad level, if they were men they wouldn't be paid at all, they'd be playing at an amateur level after work/school and they'd likely have to pay for it themselves.

Sweden women's national football team lost 3-0 to an U17 boy's team who were only playing with 10 players.

Australia's women's national football team lost 7-0 to an U15 boy's team.

USA's women's national football team (World Champions) lost 5-2 to an U15 boy's team.

That's factual and objective. The quality gap is far greater than any wage gap. Those boys's teams aren't professional, no one's advocating for them to be paid, for how people should want to go watch their matches etc. and they're still far better than the women's teams.
Then you can't blame it sexism, patriarchy etc. Even female sports fans don't tend to watch women's football as it's just so bad. You can go watch higher level football for free at your local amateur club, then why would you want to pay to watch the women play? Most people like to watch sports played at a high level.

Women are already the ones getting preferential treatment since they're professional at all, they're more ""professional women"" than ""professional footballers"". They're only getting paid because they're women. Then I really don't want to hear about how unfair it is to women.

I don't understand why anyone would think that volleyball, tennis, handball or whatever was different though, as the exact same is the case there. They're just like men's sports but at a much lower level. When I want to watch sports I tend to go for the best football available, I don't watch sports as a ""political act"" but for my own entertainment. 

If you find women's sports great that's fine, you can like whatever you like but that doesn't change the fact that you just like watching sports played at a lower level. I can't watch professional women's football for example and I think that's because I played and coached football myself. It's just too fucking bad for me to enjoy, I coached teen boys on an amateur level that were faster, stronger, could shoot harder, could tackle harder etc. and they were just random nobodies playing for fun. The amount of beginner mistakes in women's pro football just makes me frustrated. I'd be frustrated and disappointed if the boys I coached made those mistakes.

I have an easier time watching other women's sports even though they're also just sports at a lower level, and I think that's because I didn't play or coach those sports so I don't have a personal understanding of every little mistake being made, so I may not notice them all. I'd still rather watch men's sports as it's just plain better but other sports don't frustrate me like women's football does.

I'd be interested in hearing what you find great about women's football to be honest. If you simply mean ""It's great that women get to play football."" then I completely agree, but if we're talking about it as a professional sport that people like to watch I simply don't get it. Why would you want to watch bad football when there's good football on pretty much all the time? Even second and third tier men's football from every country is far better, why pick the worst football that you're likely to ever see on TV?",Denmark,/r/europe/comments/a8ndun/steaua_bucharest_owner_gigi_becali_labelled/ecdfusq/,Dnarg,1545553098

2270,"Assuming the people here in the comments are right that the guy's a moron, the lie is probably more about *why* he says it and *how* he says it. Like, what the fuck does ""against nature"" mean exactly? Men didn't evolve to play football either, it's not really something that occurs naturally at all, it's something we invented to have fun. If women have fun playing football then that's not really anymore ""against nature"" than men enjoying football is.

As a business man I understand why he's against it though, women's football is football on a terrible level and forcing clubs to have women's teams is insanity and nothing but a money drain. There's so much football available at all times these days so why would anyone pick the worst football available to watch? Male footballers get paid well, clubs are able to make money from it etc. because people want to watch it. People watching it means sponsors are interested in advertising their products to all of the viewers, and that brings in the money. Barely anyone wants to watch women's football because it's so much worse than other football, even female football fans tend to watch men's football, not women's football. Then there's no big sponsor deals and no big money to be made.

On top of that it's also clearly just about politics and nothing else, it's not like women's football has earned its way to the top, to professionalism etc. Men's football took over a hundred years to get to its current point, then you don't just get to come in from the sideline and demand equal pay etc. 

What bothers me the most about using sports as a political battlefield is that it's so hypocritical and pathetic. People on their ""Women can do anything a man can do!"" crusade instantly asking/demanding that men should fix all of their issues is a fucking joke. What happened to the whole ""Stong, independent woman!"", ""You go, girl! You show them!"" etc. where people tried to motivate women to make things happen for themselves? Asking the guys to solve your issues is anything *but* being strong, independent and ""doing anything a man can do"". 
Why don't women make their own league, their own football organizations etc? That would be the ""I don't need no man!"", ""Strong, independent woman!"", ""You go, girl!"" thing to do. 

Steaua Bucharest has earned its place in the best male football league by being better than the teams in the lower leagues. That doesn't mean they've also earned its place as a top women's teams though. Just demanding that the top male clubs should make women's teams is ridiculous and completely undermines the entire women's league system. Just being a big ""male club"" doesn't mean you've earned the right to compete at the top of female football, they haven't earned that spot. They haven't worked their way up through the ranks of female football, they just buy their way past all the lower leagues which is obviously unfair to all the female teams playing at lower levels. They have no chance of ever competing in the sport if Man Utd or whoever can just use ""male money"" to buy a better female team.



The part about ""looking pretty"" can be true or false depending on what he means. If we still assume he's the moron that people claim he is (I have no clue who he is), then he's probably just saying it to be ""funny"" in a ""stay in the kitchen"" kind of way. On the off-chance that he's actually talking about evolution he has a point obviously but it's still not an argument against (or for) playing football. Men didn't evolve to play football either, no one did. 

I'm all for women playing football if that's what they want to do, I'm just against forcing women's football on men's football clubs, against making men fund the entire thing, against making it a political issue about sexism, equality etc. Sports obviously aren't about equality at all, most of us have no hope in hell of ever being signed by Steaua Bucharest or any other good team, being a pro football (or athlete in general) isn't a right for anyone.",Denmark,/r/europe/comments/a8ndun/steaua_bucharest_owner_gigi_becali_labelled/ecdgt0q/,Dnarg,1545554441

2279,"It can help pointing in the direction of Polaris, but that's it. The alignment would be sufficient for visual purposes but if you want to use your equipment for astrophotography you need to do the alignment through the polar scope. First, the laser pointer is not so precise to accurately aim at a certain point. Secondly, you basically need to align the declination axis of your equatorial mount parallel to the Earth rotation axis. An the Earth rotation axis is just near Polaris, it doesn't point directly at it. The polar scopes have a reticle (pattern) to help just with that, you only need to know where Polaris is located relative to the Earth Axis (which direction), at the moment you are doing the alignment.

2282,"Respectively, I disagree. For us it *is* a huge deal that there were even 10 000 people to begin with, and it is huge deal that the number is growing from week to week. 

The situation is much more complex than just putting those numbers in perspective. You need to put it in a larger context to really grasp why its news worthy. 

For starters, getting that number of Serbs to meet in one common goal is nearly impossible if it's not a sporting event.

Second of all, to put the numbers in perspective again, a bit differently. Turnout at elections in the last few years varied between 52 and 56 percent as far as I remember. Vucic had on average 55% of those voters (however, some places he had much better percentage, some less, but on the whole, those are the numbers). So, little less than 30% of whole population is for him, and when you take into account that in that 30% there are people who are dead, paid, blackmailed, you can also arguably say those are not large numbers of true supporters. There is realistically half of the voters who don't support Vucic, and a number of people who don't vote because they don't see the point (which is sad) who also don't support Vucic. You could also arguably say that those 40 to 50% of non voters are against Vucic, because every election, anyone who is the ruling party supporter for whatever reason, and many of those are opportunistic people just sticking with whoever is on top, will without doubt turn up to vote. So, 30% is the largest he will get. And he can only dream of 35 000 people on his rally that are his true supporters who believe in him, because they are only there to get something, money, sandwich or job position. I do think that is something important to say when we discuss numbers. 

Third, and most important, not everyone is on streets for mostly two reasons. They are either scared of the ruling party or they don't think they'll make a difference. After the protest of Fifth October that got Milosevic down, things didn't go much better for us and people don't even know if there's the point in doing it all over again. That's also the problem with voting and a big reason why Vucic is where he is today.

Having 35 000 people on the streets is newsworthy and very, very importaint, because it can get other half of population to wake up and stop being scared. It's also important because the government is trying to play it down, and that means they are scared of what it might mean if it actually starts something. That is also why we need more people to hear about it. It's not just the protest for the sake of protesting, it could be a starting point of political awakening of at least 40% of voters who are indifferent, scared and who gave up politics and participating in it.

In a country where we rarely agree on anything, where people are more focused on surviving and finding means for their kids to eat, go to school and grow up properly, and where the moral is the lowest you can imagine, it's a huge deal having a number of people growing fo week to week, fighting for a change.",,/r/europe/comments/a8pee3/third_saturday_of_protests_in_belgrade_serbia/ecdh1jp/,blakebambi,1545554739

2602,"English is the most broken and dysfunctional language that I have ever spoken. It's spelling and pronunciation have absolutely no correlation. It makes sense for it to be the current world language as outta spoken in every continent as an official language. But it's so simple and broken. It had the simplest grammar I've encountered, except perhaps Dutch (maybe). It's so simple that there are few ways of saying things and there's a lack of creativity in some respects. It doesn't have cases. It only distinguishes between indirect and direct objects in pronouns. It has less tenses than the Romance languages. For crying out loud, even Russian, a language with around ten tenses had subjunctive, and English doesn't. It doesn't even have a defined future tense, it's literally will + some present tense. It has no genders, only plural, bringing down the learning curve a lot (something that I personally like because I find it to be more objective than in other languages because how does a table have a gender). It does not have directional verbs, which tell you if the verb is a repeating action or is instanced (something that I've only encountered in a language I'm learning). 
Did i forget to mention it's spelling is horrible? What is the purpose of a written language of it's way of communicating is inconsistent. Even in French, the last world language, there are too many ways to make the same sound so the same sounding verb could be in a variety of tenses which also beats the purpose, but at least each tense has a different spelling. Spanish, even though it has a lot of letters that sound the same, the degree thereof depending on your accent, has consistent spelling because the same letters are always used in a certain way. Same thing goes for Dutch and Russian; in all of these languages there are many, sometimes convoluted rules, but there are rules. There are two things i like about English, one already mentioned and the other is the seemingly unique R and Th sounds, even though the suggest version exists in Castellan Spanish.

The main difference between Western Europe today and America is the fact that America's subjugated peoples were integrated into society (well, we tried) rather than cast away. Thus after WWI African Americans moved north in large numbers and after WWII White Americans moved South.

2735,"&gt; The alternative assumptions we can make are that either representatives are less familiar with politics than the average person, or representatives do not represent the interests of the people. The former is utterly ridiculous to even think of, so that leaves us while two options.

Is it really ? I don't think so. There's a few social scientists who are starting to theorize a sort of split of society with some sort of ""elite"" on one side and the rest of the population on the other, no connection whatsoever and diverging interest with one side doesn't. Emmanuel Todd for example, a demographer who thinks  that changes in education are the causes of major societal and cultural changes, talk about a sort of separatism of the higher educated class, who believes themselves to be more intelligent than the rest of society and therefore are starting to ask themselves if it even make sense for them to take the type to listen to everyone else's (uneducated and stupid) opinions.

When it come to a (mostly) economics-based decision, we also have to add things like ideological blindness that others like Frédéric Lordon or the French group of economists, ""les économistes attérrés"" have been talking about for more than a decade now. 

Based on this kind of things, it is totally possible to imagine a political class doing thing that they think are good but don't represent the interest of the people at all. They aren't all-mighty, they're humans that just like every other humans aren't creatures of pure rationality and their irrationality might lead them on a path that isn't in the citizens' interest nor is it what citizens want, which I'll argue is even more important in a system that calls itself a democracy.",Aquitaine (France),/r/europe/comments/a8babz/brexit_cleared_for_takeoff/ecche9x/,Thelk641,1545517533

&gt; - That's silly you have no causal basis for relating the two because &lt;supporting reasons&gt;.
&gt; 3rd dude: Your view seems to be something along the lines of: ""If elephants can't make pig sounds there must be pink elephants.""

&gt; Do you see the fallacy here? Both formal and informal.

&gt; This is what I was talking about above. This argument in support of this proposition is wrong =/= All arguments in support of this proposition are wrong.

I don't know what point you are trying to make here.  This doesn't make any sense.  

&gt; A demonstrably false claim. ""Problem views"" as defined by the given examples are pervasive enough in ""European"" society that they remain political battlegrounds. Half of the EU doesn't have gay marriage and among more religious countries the political and cultural views on gays are not positive. Free speech limitations are similar, especially when details are talked about regarding the press, various types of political speech etc. At times formerly right-wing authoritarian immigrants end up defending free speech more due to their minority status encouraging a change in political views on this issue. Gender equality similarly is a battleground today as evidenced by the overwhelmingly western user base of this website. Only secular states seem to be a given, which minority sects virtually always prefer and support anyway.   

On average, migrants are more likely to have ""problem views"" than indigenous Europeans.  What part of ""don't make the problem worse"" is giving you trouble?  There are sexists in European society and there are anti-gay views, but Islam's views and treatment of women and gays is worse than in European countries.  In terms of ""problem views"" they are worse virtually across the board.   

&gt; Assumptions loaded upon assumptions. You're welcome to try and justify them, especially the demographic and anti-conversion bits.   

Demographic trends showing higher Muslim fertility rates:  
http://www.pewforum.org/2015/04/02/europe/   
Women from many immigrant groups are much more likely to have a third child than native women in France, the UK, and Belgium:

In Sweden, higher TFR for foreign-born women:     
https://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/stats/documents/ece/ces/ge.11/2016/WP14_Rev.1.pdf  
In all European countries except Ireland, Muslims have higher fertility rate than non-Muslims:  
https://i2.wp.com/assets.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/11/22094719/PF_11.29.17_muslims-update-16.png?zoom=2.5&amp;w=676  

Some research shows immigrate fertility declines over time, but that still takes generations and it still says higher than the indigenous European rates.  

Not sure what you mean by ""anti-conversion"" bits.  Do you mean their failure to integrate?  

Muslim integration in Europe not proceeding very well.  This article also shows that they are much more likely to have problem views on gays and abortion.

2841,"There is no source that fits the bill fully, although renewables are getting there, and gas is more tolerable than coal. 

The cost of energy plays an important role, as do political and security implications. Europe isn't particularly relevant anyway, because it accounts for an increasingly small fraction of global emissions output or pollution. 

The question is not what Germany or France do, but what India, China and the rest of Asia do, the world does not revolve around us any more. And in those countries large scale nuclear efforts just to reduce emissions are not realistic. 

It is both too cost prohibitive and also has national security implications. Nuclear energy is almost exclusively supplied by Russia and China to developing countries, often on the basis of loans because of the exploding cost, which makes developing nations politically dependent. Security is often lackluster, regimes are unstable, and growing capacity of (cyber)-terrorism is particularly relevant when it comes to nuclear energy. 

So add that to the cost and the difficulty of deployment and you can see why it's not a particularly attractive choice to produce energy. What should be done is to put a significant amount of money into research that drastically improves the capacity to store energy, and to produce renewable energy. A green manhattan project if you will. Also geoengineering is underexplored, to mitigate the effect of polluting energy production.

2843,"&gt;for example how do you put Berlin's and Saarland's interests in sync? 

My point exactly, local governing is hard enough, why make it into a USA sized monster? Plus the EU has even bigger differences.

Even in Iceland, with 330k, we have some pretty decent disagreements on politics and running the country. But it never gets out of hand because we all share the same identity. 

Compare to the USA where a white Texan oil worker has absolutely nothing in common with a black shop owner in Queens, e.t.c. Why would these two characters fight for each other or together against a cause? They share no traditions, no ideals, no identity. If you put a common government over them it's a great way to rule without any real protests. The Texan white guys might protest, the blacks in NY might protest.. but all these groups will never fight you at the same time for the same cause.

&gt;I see the point on having a Nordic Union, but I also don't see a Nordic Union being as strong as the current arrangement.

I don't really get this. A NU would somewhat strengthen all the NU countries and they would have a EFTA/Schenge type agreement with central/southern European countries. Iceland/Norway are doing great without the EU while some EU countries are really suffering..

Ill tell my one legged cousin he lost his leg in the middle east after the US triggered article 5 of NATO because you guys were ""looking after us"". Ill go tell him he lost his buddy in that same IED bomb because you guys were ""looking after us"".

Pay some god damn respect to us. Most americans cant even point at the netherlands on a world map yet we are your oldest allies. We fought along your side in your revolutionary war, we fought together in world war 2 in both asia and europe, we followed you in Korea, in Lebanon, in Bosnia, in Afghanistan, in Iraq, in Libya, in Syria. Every god damn time Washington called the Hague we delivered on our end of our promise. Literally never was supporting the US a political question for our parliament.

All with a pride feeling of duty and repaying the favor of world war 2. Those many American that are burried on our soil that we pay our respects to every May 4th and every Christmas. Maybe it is time for us Dutch people to realize that those Americans burried in our soil stood for different things than those Americans living on the other side of the ocean in 2018. Maybe we should realize we do not owe modern day Americans for the sacrifices of Americans long gone.

Telling us to raise our military budget to non officially agreed upon bottom lines in a respectfull manner like Obama did? Completely justified.

Claiming we are freeloaders after the many, many Dutch men and women who died because washington called upon us? Completely disrespectfull and the very core of the EU/US break we are witnessing happening right now.

The only time i ever saw my cousin cry was when i showed him the news report where Trump called us freeloaders and cowards. He lost his leg for a people that are barely able to point where his fatherland is, and those who can call it the home of freeloaders and cowards. He went trough hell only to be shit upon by the likes of Trump. First time i saw someone cry his eyes out out of anger. He was my hero while growing up. That image of him crying so intensely gave me a very small understanding of what he went trough. 

You see, seeing your child hero being destroyed like that does something with a man. The Netherlands is, together with Poland, considered the stronghold of US power within Europe. For the first time since 1944 the Dutch people start to question US world domination. And thats thanks to statements like you yourself just wrote down. Why follow a country blindly for nearly a century if they threaten to drop you like a sack of worthless shit if you reduce your military budget for 5-10 years.

Made us realize you guys dont see us as allies. You see us as a customer. You want our money, not friendship.

Yeah, you and the media only care when white people get shot and you don't care about the minorities who get shot.

If we stopped the war on drugs it would decrease the amount of gun deaths significantly. American politicians don't want to stop the war on drugs because they get campaign money to keep it going. And you people only care about ""mass shootings"" of white people.

3098,"A European army scares the hell out of me for the fact that it could be deployed against nationalist or anti-EU protests. In fact that's exactly how I see it being used *way before* any real war.

National militaries typically lean rightward and pose a threat of insubordination or implosion if shit truly hits the fan politically, same with the police. Many people in these organisations are *seriously*, *seriously* unhappy with the direction of their country and politics - especially on immigration and the decline of their native identity. People who join the military usually want to fight for their country, not somebody else's.

We've seen this in extremity with the likes of German far right cells in the military, recent Tommy Robinson related army dismissals and the French police toying with supporting protests. Many more examples exist - national militaries are seen as a liability to Europhilic leaders like Macron because they bloody hate him.

The idea of an occupying European military presence in response to the likes of the Gilets Jaunes is fucking scary to me. Much scarier than the Russian threat. You pull in foreign nationals because they will have less of a problem harshly policing natives. It's fucked up and I am certain this would happen as it has happened many times throughout history. Even on a national scale it occurs whereby far away police forces are pulled in to handle more local protests and riots to minimise potential sympathies (e.g. Irish troubles or Scottish police pulled to English protests).

This is why I see Europhilic leaders wanting a European army - they want to be able to crush their own nation's police and military if/when they lose their support.

*That* is when a country is fucked, when the military/police no longer support the government or either mainstream party, and that's what's happening in Europe in my view.",Scotland: Weltschmerz,/r/europe/comments/a8avvz/europe_responds_with_alarm_to_us_defence/ecbt0ft/,popeiscool,1545496543

The Holocaust has that effect but the crimes of the French, British and Soviets do not (which coincidentally for those that play a numbers game, had many times more victims)? You realize during WW2 just one of the famines caused by the Brits in occupied India resulted in the death of [approximately 3 million](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengal_famine_of_1943) people? Do you really need me to expand more on the Soviet or French acts of aggression and crimes against millions of innocent people?

A reference for the attitude of the British leadership about this man-made holocaust:

&gt;Reportedly, when he first received a telegram from the British colonial authorities in New Delhi about the rising toll of famine deaths in Bengal, his reaction was simply that he regretted that nationalist leader Mahatma Gandhi was not one of the victims.  
&gt;  
&gt;Later at a War Cabinet meeting, Churchill blamed the Indians themselves for the famine, saying that they “breed like rabbits.”  
&gt;  
&gt;His attitude toward Indians was made crystal clear when he told Secretary of State for India Leopold Amery: ""I hate Indians. They are a beastly people with a beastly religion.""",,/r/europe/comments/a7a254/what_do_you_know_about_world_war_ii/ecbk929/,GeorgePapadopoulos,1545488332

Can you show me an empire where Christians and Muslims lived together and where even allowed them to stay and keep their religious beliefs by simply paying money prior to 18 century? I'll wait.. Also the extra tax was literally what muslims paid to mosques so nobody paid extra tax. Christians just paid it to state and voluntarily paid money to church as extra.

Like bruh pinnacle of tolerance Europe was genociding or displacing jews literally hundreds years after this level of tolarance you call barbaric. It's also ironic you used the word barbaric where barbarians were much more tolerant to religious minorities than romans.

&gt;very often their children were taken, forced to become Muslims and sent to fight and kill more Christians.

Devshirme was practiced in specific regions not on Christians as a whole and you cannot force kids to become Muslims kids have no religion. They were also given an education that basically best in the region and nobody who is not part of a nobility could even hope to get. Doesn't make it right I guess but in a time of monarchies and serfdom its normal and better than what most peasants get.

Morals are personal beliefs in my opinion. In your opinion, they are the contrary. This is a philosophical debate and I will not go into details. You see a circle, I see a square. 

If I picked out 100 random people in the streets I wouldn't be able to tell it either. It is pathetic to judge people like that. But after learning more about them, seeing how they act and what their beliefs are, I could tell more clearly whether they are sexually more liberal, or less.

I did not push my opinions on anyone. What I did was I voiced my opinion. I did not tell you to do this thing or that thing. One problem with your line of thinking: we live in a society and given that, we have to act as one. Liberal vs. conservative talk has therefore an actual meaning. Progress has to have its limits. Otherwise liberals degenerate the society into a state of absolute rot, or conservatives degrade the society into a fanatical oppressive utopia.

I am a follower of Christ's teachings, with no Church affilation. I, however don't consider myself nor do I want to call myself a Christian, as to not be a hypocrite. I respect the religion, however. 

Everyone judges. I may look like a total bigotted moron for voicing my own personal opinion, but it's fine, I got used to it and I accepted the fact that we all are different, holding different worldviews. But everyone judges. There were people that did not judge, and had [their heads cut off](https://i.imgur.com/O3Ltubu.png). In some cases, it is better to be judgemental, as it can save lives. In some cases, it can cause suffering. It is embodied within us to judge, to judge situations, people, behavior of others and everything. It is the basic psychological instinct of a human to judge.

3195,"In a study published May 30 in the journal Nature Communications, scientists looked at DNA from 151 mummified Egyptians, which were entombed from about 1400 B.C. to just after 400 A.D., in the Roman period. They found that the genetic material within the mummies was more similar to ancient peoples of the Near East and the Levant (an area of the eastern Mediterranean including Israel and Palestine) than it is to modern Egyptians… The study also shows genetic linkage between ancient Egyptians and Neolithic peoples from modern-day Turkey and Europe, Schuenemann says,” which explains the Egyptians lighter skin pigmentation. “The study also suggests that gene flow from Sub-Saharan Africa to Egypt has significantly picked up in the last 1,500 years, likely facilitated by the slave trade, which began early in this time period.”

Egyptian Mummy DNA Study Suggests Close Ties With Middle East, Europe
http://www.newsweek.com/egyptian-mummy-dna-study-suggests-close-ties-middle-east-europe-617767
Their analysis suggests that conquests by Alexander the Great and other foreigners didn’t have as large a genetic influence on ancient Egyptians as some have thought, says study first author Verena Schuenemann, with the Institute for Archaeological Sciences at Germany’s University of Tübingen. The study also shows genetic linkage between ancient Egyptians and Neolithic peoples from modern-day Turkey and Europe, Schuenemann says.
The mummies come from the archaeological site of Abusir el-Meleq, situated on the Nile River in what was ancient Middle Egypt. Since all the mummies were from this area, the scientists note that their results cannot be generalized to the south or north of Egypt (Upper or Lower Egypt), which may have been more or less affected by foreign conquest

Ancient Egyptian mummy genomes suggest an increase of Sub-Saharan African ancestry in post-Roman periods
https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms15694
The samples recovered from Middle Egypt span around 1,300 years of ancient Egyptian history from the New Kingdom to the Roman Period. Our analyses reveal that ancient Egyptians shared more ancestry with Near Easterners than present-day Egyptians, who received additional sub-Saharan admixture in more recent times. This analysis establishes ancient Egyptian mummies as a genetic source to study ancient human history and offers the perspective of deciphering Egypt’s past at a genome-wide level.",,/r/europe/comments/a8ep21/marcus_aurelius_philosopher_emperor/ecbl4jb/,pancakesarenicebitch,1545489244

In my mind, the issue is not so much technological, but political. Space exploration requires *massive* investments for limited initial gain. 

A Middle Age monarch could spare a tidy sum from his treasury to fund an expedition across the ocean, it wouldn't be a big risk for him and he might even see a return on that investment within a few years. 

Space travel is **a lot** more expensive. Which government agency are you going to slash in order to fund your space adventure and what will the ROI on it be? 

As important as it may be you probably won't even see a profit off of it during your lifetime, or more importantly.. during the lifetime of your electorate. How do you sell this kind of expenditure to them when even in the richest countries on Earth there are still starving and homeless people? 

It's a long term investment with no short term pay off. We can't even come to a consensus on climate change and that could possibly lead to *extinction*. 

So in order for extra-solar exploration/colonization to be feasible, we'd probably need to make it much cheaper. We would have to be much better at harnessing the energy of our solar system and while all that would be achievable in a ""Is it possible by the laws of physics"" kind of way, it's not a 100% given that we'll manage. 

The ocean was always going to be crossed eventually, but when it comes to space exploration it's just as possible we'll destroy ourselves before we get anywhere.

Although the worst was over by the end of 1923, Germany was still scarred by WW1. Only in 1927 did the industrial production reach the pre-war level (1913). During that short period of time the political system was also very unstable. Governments changed nearly every year and they were often only able to rule through illiberal emergency decrees. Overall those few years were more of a period of stabilisation than a golden age.

If the concept of ""Golden Age"" is defined through the comparison to other countries, I'd rather call the era of Bismarck our golden age: Germany was finally united which lead to an inner peace, the economy was thriving with many companies being founded (Gründerzeit), architecture was at a peak, there was a strong ""Bürgertum"", due to Bismarck international relations were rather peaceful, crucial reforms were being made and there were no extremist parties.

3345,"Before Islam the majority of Saharan Africa was inhabited by afro Asiatic people. Berbers, Cushites, Sudanites and etc. 'Black' is a fairly problematic term as there is wide phenotypically differences between populations that are considered black to the extent that black groups are closer genetically to non black groups.

I digress. When Arabs invaded non Arab lands there was the process of Arabization. At the bipolar end we have areas outside of Saudi Arabia which are now considered Arab. There's was heavy linguistic, cultural and genetic pressure from these invading Arabs as Islam spread the same way you see East Asian appearing looking people's all the way in central Asia,and you see Europeans speaking Turkic langauges despite Turkic languages coming from what is now Mongolia. And the same way places outside of Lazio speak Latin languages. Turkificatiom, Romanization and Arabization are all related terms for the phenomenon of linguistic, cultural and Genetic shifts in population due to outside pressures.

You have to take these things into consideration when making conclusions on how ancient Egyptians appeared. You can also look at art and hieroglyphics of pre Greek, Roman or Arab Egyptians. They're very clearly not white in appearance. I suppose the best term would be 'brown' for them. Howevee there is without a doubt black people present in ancient Egypt whether through slavery or freedom. 

The populations strongly predate semetic speaking peoples which is why I find your source dubious considering its a news article from ABC.. My best guess is what's the most abundant of data is nobility as they were buried well. Nobility has a tendency to not reflect the actual population. English, Spanish, Russian, Scandinavian  nobility are all interrelated and German in origin. Say if you were to take the genetic data of English kings, you would probably get the impression English people are most related to central Europeans when the reality differed.

Lastly, racial definitions are falling into disuse as they've long been proven unscientific. Say I'm right, and ancient Egyptian somehow comes into our time and they're brown coloured. Where do they fall? It's cumbersome and inaccurate. The best way is to use Afro Asiatic people as that represents them culturally, genetically and linguistically.",Ich mag Arsch zu essen,/r/europe/comments/a8ep21/marcus_aurelius_philosopher_emperor/ecb8miv/,sunics,1545474461

Sweden is bigger than others by land area and 10 million population. It isn't so drastic though pecause even though Denmark has small area it has 5,8 million people. Difference is quite big, but it isn't anything compared to differences between eu countries. Iceland is different case though.

Iceland is an open tiny economy. Even if devaluing its own currency can, in short-term, boost exports and/or tourism, it also needs to inevitably import a lot and its own citizens probably want and need to visit other places in the world once in a while. Devaluing is not a magic tool for the country as it hurts the latter, as well as cuts into people's savings and companies' investments. Having a major stable international currency could have some big benefits in that regard.

3460,"Some other issues I could think of: population wise all the Nordic countries are (slightly) smaller than the Benelux (27m vs 27.5m), while being geographically more spun out. Furthermore, the most important trading partners, according to Wikipedia, would be the Benelux and Germany. Which would then not be in the Union.

As you may have noticed as well, where do you draw the line of a Kalmar Union? It did not take long before Estonia, Scotland or Finland to be mentioned. There is a lot of common history and brotherhood in Europe which makes drawing such lines so damn difficult.

In conclusion I think I prefer all Nordic countries joining the EU, to strengthen the position of economically and democratically sound members, further cheapen and increase trade amongst Nordic countries and their closest partners, as well as being able to make a fist against the Russians in the Arctic and Baltic regions. 

Also the EU bloc of 400-500m people may actually be able to ward off the Orwellian Chinese Dictatorship (OCD) currently controlling 1.5b people. After all cities such as Shanghai (36m) or Guangzhou (44m) contain more people than the Benelux or the Nordic countries.

&gt;They then compared the genomes of these ancient Egyptians with data from the genome of modern Egyptians.
Their results were the opposite of what they were expecting to find, Professor Krause said.
""Instead of finding that ancient Egyptians were more African, we actually found them to be almost zero or much less sub-Saharan African than the population that live in Egypt today,"" he said
""They have these closest genetic links to the fertile crescent and the eastern populations of what's now Israel, but if they came from there or if they just evolved with gene flow all the time in this region, we cannot really say.""
They also saw a clear genetic continuity right across the 1300-year time period of the studied mummies, despite the fact that over that time course Egypt was invaded by the Greeks, the Romans and Nubians.

Much of the colonies that were to become the United States, were originally theocracies, like Massachusetts or Connecticut. Maryland was created as a haven for Catholics, but Protestants soon became the majority, and oppressed the Catholics.  America's separation of church and state, as embedded in the 1789 constitution, has nothing to do with the ""people fleeing religious persecution"" 2 centuries prior (those people established theocracies and oppressed *their* minorities).  Separation of church and state was an influence from the European Enlightenment.   


The Constitution wasn't written by the Puritans.  It was written by a bunch of intellectuals *2 centuries afterwards*, who were influenced by Enlightenment.

&amp;#x200B;

While we're on topic, the Puritans were kicked out of Great Britain for trying to establish a theocracy *there*. But, like every country, Americans need a feel-good national narrative, that their country was created by people that just wanted freedom, and the fact that they *eventually* stopped executing witches, killing Indians, or owning slaves, is what makes America so darn exceptional.

3672,"gamey is a reference to the stronger flavour of some of the wild meats, and it is also used to refer to the smell of meat that is beginning to rot (putrify) because it was not properly cleaned or handled.

Moose and deer eat a lot of browse, which means the small twigs and branches of trees and shrubs. If cattle get into areas with brush instead of grass they will eat browse just like deer to and their meat will be much more gamey flavoured. 

Domestic animals are cared for. They are either fed or they are put on decent pasture. They do not need to work very hard for their food so their muscles tend to be less developed and not as loaded with myoglobin, which is similar to hemoglobin but it is in the muscle and helps the muscles to use oxygen more efficiently over longer periods of time. Myoglobin also makes the meat darker and more meaty tasting. Since wild animals usually have to work harder for their food as well as to avoid predators their meat tends to have more myoglobin and be darker as well as less tender.

Found this with simple googling.

Afghanistan was incredibly unpopular in Germany, no one wanted to send soldiers there. 
We still did though because we were part of NATO. 

Every time we send our soldiers somewhere it is incredibly unpopular it doesn't matter where, Germans military involvement anywhere will always be unpopular with Germans. That doesn't mean the Bundeswehr isn't active all over the globe, doesn't mean we didn't send troops to the Baltics. 
Doesn't mean we don't remain part of the airspace policing. 

Just means that the majority German public is uncomfortable with using military force. 

I have to add I have never heart anything negative about our NATO troops in the Baltics, if maybe a German or anyone else has numbers has some research on people's opinion about our NATO deployments in in the Baltics that would be great. 

I just know that any place not on Europe is always double controversial because in general people don't understand what our troops are doing there because imho our government doesn't explain it good enough. A lot of people don't understand why the Bundeswehr is in Mali for example. To fight extremism ok, but what does that have to do with us? You have to explain stuff like that better to the populace. 


Now when it comes to the Baltics things are not as complicated. People understand that there is a fear of Russian aggression. It is far easier to explain. People may still feel uncomfortable sending troops abroad but at least they understand why we are sending troops.

Shipping produces about 2,5% of wordwide CO2 emissions and while it is expected to rise, ships are by far the most efficient form of transportation.

The claim that ships would pollute more than cars comes from their particulate emissions. The regulations on shipping exhaust are quite tame and the bunker oil they use for fuel is rich in Sulfur (becomes Sulfur dioxide) and other pollutants (become various other particulates) while the motors are also working at high temperatures (producing nitrogen oxides from atmospheric nitrogen during the combustion).  The Sulfur is where the claim of the massive pollution by shipping comes from, since Sulphur has been practically eliminated from most fuels you can get your hands on.

Here an excursus from wikipedia (first source at hand) Italian

&gt;In realtà l'acconciatura dei capelli di Augusto rispondeva anche a criteri di arte politica[\[7\]](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acconciature_nell%27antica_Roma#cite_note-7) che l'imperatore per primo curò in modo particolare conscio dell'importanza politica della sua rappresentazione visiva presso i sudditi dell'Impero. Nel *ritratto di Ottaviano* (risalente al periodo tra il [35](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/35_a.C.) e il [30 a.C.](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/30_a.C.)), una testa ai [Musei Capitolini](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musei_Capitolini) a [Roma](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roma) che ritrae l'[Imperatore Augusto](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperatore_Augusto) in giovane età, quando era ancora solo Ottaviano e non aveva i titoli imperiali, quando cioè era ancora preso dalla lotta per la vendetta di Cesare e la conquista della supremazia politica senza esclusione di colpi, viene rappresentato con i capelli trattati a ciocche mosse agitatamente e la celebre ciocca ""a tenaglia"" è seminascosta sulla fronte tra il movimento delle altre. Ottaviano è infatti all'inizio della sua evoluzione politica quando cioè vuole rappresentare l'accordo politico con la parte popolare cesariana. Diversa l'acconciatura semplice e severa ispirata ai primitivi costumi romani, di quando ormai è imperatore gradito anche al partito dei senatori conservatori. Così appare nell'[Augusto di via Labicana](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augusto_di_via_Labicana), un *pontifex maximus* con una aurea compostezza e con un'espressione di orgoglioso riserbo.

&amp;#x200B;

Translation

&gt;In reality, the hairstyles of Augustus's hair also responded to criteria of political art \[7\], which the emperor was the first to take a particular note of the political importance of his visual representation among the subjects of the Empire. In the portrait of Ottaviano (dating back to the period between 35 and 30 BC), a head to the Capitoline Museums in Rome depicting the Emperor Augustus at a young age, when he was still only Octavian and had no imperial titles, when he was still taken from the fight for Caesar's vengeance and the conquest of political supremacy without the exclusion of blows, he is represented with his hair treated in shapely moved strands and the famous ""pincer"" strand is half hidden on the forehead between the movement of the others. Octavian is in fact at the beginning of his political evolution when he wants to represent the political agreement with the popular part of Caesar. Different the simple and severe hairstyle inspired by the primitive Roman costumes, when by now it is also a welcome emperor to the party of conservative senators. Thus appears in the Augustus of Via Labicana, a pontifex maximus with a golden composure and an expression of proud reserve.

So  the blonde hair of Augustus was more probable to be of german descent (or berber like Septimus Severus) or that i was more of an evocation of Greek/Roman deites and heores (all homeric heores are blonde) in an attempt to idolatrize the emperor since he represented the state.

Not too mention the repeated denials of Soviet human rights abuses like holdmordor etc.

Your right about East India Trading company but it is capitalism with a bit of imperialistic bent same with Nazi's but with Facism etc. My point was that while most capitalists would readly admit it's wrong doings in the past. Communist however after habit of saying the past of their ideology  as irrelevant and not true instances of communism and socialism.

Also i don't believe your system has the capacity to enact big changes and decisions and  would need some mechanism to do so that's where i believe it will fall into past pitfalls of other socialist and communist systems.

&gt;There are even socialist models with not only currency, but a free market.

Norway isn't a socialist model it's capitalism with socialism elements. It's the way things should be in my mind even though i disagree with some of the government's policy it has nothing to do with their system.

&gt;Non-infinite resources can be shared equally in a direct democratic society. Imbalance of power is what causes imbalance of material conditions. Those who have power and wealth uses them to gain even more.

You make good points on why capitalism is bad but that doesn't convince me your economic model or another flavour  will be any better nor does it address my concerns about how easy how easily it will be too corrupt due to the hierarchical nature of human beings.

&gt;Not even an argument. If you go back in time before capitalism became widespread and preach capitalism, would feudalists saying ""But it was never has been tried in a large scale."" be an argument?

My point is you can't just convince people to change their whole way life and economic model to satisfy a political curiosity, it is unfeasible and frankly a fantasy to believe people will just accept it because looks good on paper, which is what alot of people believe about communism and socialism, because the vast majority of times it's been put into practice it has. Plus feudalism didn't just disappear over centuries got replaced with capitalism. Though as i understand it Russia was basically feudalist until the bolshevik Revolution.

&gt;Equality is necessary if we are to be different individuals ethically and not shades of gray. Each human deserves same right to pursuit their interests and hobbies to have their uniqueness of activity and, leisure time to develop their unique personality. 

This is where you go off the deep end and into fantasy land imo. About the shades of gray, I wasn't linking it to ethics, I was talking about politics and ideas  we aren't just going to come together and sing  kumbaya my lord there will be ""dissenters"" what happens to them under your system? If it's anything like the other flavours socialism it won't be pretty. I and the vast majority people don't want to homogeneous Society of ideas, culture and  race i guess and that's where it leads to if the past is any indication and nothing you have said indicates it be any different. Though i definitely think your system does have a unique solution to it if a little archaic.

As for the pursuit of hobbies and interest, why would anyone be a  binman or other shitty jobs? Not every body can be a artist, scientist, filmmaker, uniform designer etc. Your going to have to delagate who does what. It is at this point you will take away a freedom from people to  seek there own dreams. 

And again it will become hierarchical as all the scientists, artist, filmmakers and uniform designers they will all use influence not to fairly distribute who does what but to increase there own station and give unfairly jobs to friends and family members because why not, wouldn't you look out for family members over others.  Over time it devolve into USSR where there was little upward mobility, punishments for leaving a job and was hard to move about because there didn't need engineers in Moscow to build Rockets they needed metalworkers in Keiv. 

Say what you will about capitalism but at least the free market kinda protects against that kind of corruption and gives a you opportunity to try to be a Rocket scientist. Maybe anarcho syndicalism is good on a small scale, maybe it can work on a bigger scale  like a country and successfully manage to do all you think it will and not fall into the past pit fulls of similar movements i doubt it though and the public isn't  going to risk it on a maybe.

Unlike the Federal Reserve, which is responsible for keeping both employment and inflation down, the dual mandate, the ECB is only responsible for keeping inflation down (single mandate). The losers here are the countries with high unemployment because the ECB is doing nothing to help them. In fact, making the situation only worse.

Nobody is talking about 2016. We're talking about how the boom started in 2010 and 2011. There was no ""massive boom"" in 2016. It's the continuation of the exact same boom starting 5 years earlier.

Iceland was pretty cheap around that time, certainly much cheaper than now. Keep in mind your chart only goes back 10 years but if it went 15 you'd see that the euro only bought around 80 krónas in 2007. Prices had not risen 100% to compensate in 3-4 years. And especially the most relevant factor for tourism numbers is the price of flights. Icelandair and Iceland Express (now known as Wow Air) started offering much cheaper flights in euros and dollars around that time. Why then? Because they could afford it since their expenses were in krónas.

Since you can't read Icelandic here are some articles in English: 

http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/icelands-economic-recovery/

&gt;Despite the half-hearted commitment to political reform, why has Iceland’s economic recovery worked so well? Gylfason believes one factor that might have contributed was that the country – unlike Ireland, which also fell upon hard times during the downturn – was not part of the Eurozone. As a result, Iceland could let its currency depreciate by 50%. This, in turn, created the conditions for an influx of tourists, who discovered they could enjoy Iceland’s rugged natural beauty with its volcanoes, geysers, waterfalls and lagoons – at a fraction of the cost of traveling to other exotic destinations.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/16/iceland-tourists-tech-resilient-bank-from-brink-financial-crisis

&gt;Despite the turmoil, the weak currency was also Iceland’s saving grace, sparking an export revival and encouraging tourists to the country.

https://www.worldfinance.com/special-reports/failing-banks-winning-economy-the-truth-about-icelands-recovery

&gt;Furthermore, through the devaluation of the krona, export revenue increased considerably.  [...] More ardent interest from tourists also began to burgeon as the tiny island gained unprecedented appeal as a cheap travel destination. Tourism has grown by 100 percent since 2006, thus indicating the economic value of an extremely promising stream of revenue for the country.

I do not trust May but the Eu has not offered anything that could reasonably be called Brexit and now they are refusing to negotiate at all.

You have to get used to the fact that the UK is a sovereign entity and the EU is not  and that the EU is getting smaller not larger.  

Norway is allowed to leave, this deal says the UK is not allowed to leave.

If the UK is not allowed to leave than that is a continuation not a withdraw.

3959,"I don't speak Russian, but if you read your own comment, you'd notice that 1990s technology should be ahead of 1980s technology. 

Between 1979 and 1988 the Leopard 2 was built with the same armor package, all tanks produced after that (with two new armor packages) were used for conversion to the configurations 2A5 and 2A6. According to a 1984 book written by Paul-Werner Krapke, *leitender Baudirektor* (project manager) of the BWB for the Leopard 2 program, this armor was at the thickest section of the tank (i.e. the front of the turret) expected to stop 125 mm APFSDS rounds from distances greater than 1,500 meters. If the T-72B3 in your fictive scenario used ammunition from the 1980s and the Leopard 2 used modern ammunition made after 2000 (although that still would require modifications to the gun system, which not all operators of the Leopard 2A4 have adopted - Switzerland for example has made the correct modifications, Poland on the other hand is still using 1987's DM33 APFSDS and only recently made a contract with Rheinmetall to modify the gun), there could be something like a firepower parity. However the T-72B3 has superior optics (the third generation thermal imaging module Catherine-XP developed by the French company Thales) compared to the Leopard 2's WGB-X (which is based on the Common Modules developed in 1972 by Texas Instruments). There is a reason why the fire control system optics and optronics of the Leopard 2A4 are always changed during upgrades.


In terms of gun performance, their is parity between the two tanks. As written by Dipl.-Ing. Rolf Hilmes, who worked for the German BWB as specialist on tank technology, both guns provide the same amount of raw performance, i.e. a muzzle energy output between 10 and 11 MJ firing APFSDS ammo. In Soviet times, the T-72 tanks were held back by their poor ammunition (which wasn't as advanced due to cost-saving measures) and the autoloaders (which limited the maximum length of the projectiles). Both of these issues have been fixed in the recent years. Russia has developed new ammunition that is on par with NATO's (and just as expensive) and the T-72B3 features a modified autoloader to allow firing these rounds ([here](http://i.imgur.com/fj1lk0P.jpg) is a photo of the ammo selection panel of the T-72B3, it does support *Svinets-1* and *Svinets-2* projectiles). 


The T-72B3 has better optics, better armor (although likely not enough to stop modern NATO ammunition at normal ranges) and better ammo (unless the gun system has been adapted to allow firing high-pressure ammo, which requires changes to the recoil system and gun brakes).

3963,"Lateran pacts: they were more than one, signed together: a treaty recognizing the independence and sovereignity of the Holy See, which is the basis of the Vatican City State; a financial convention which settled some ancient disputes over Church properties previously seized by the State, customs provisions, etc.; and a concordat establishing civil relations between the Church and the State: oath of office of bishops before the State (except for the vicar of the pope), exemption from conscription for priests, compliance of rules about marriages and annulments, provisions for a State religion (which meant compulsory religious education in State schools), etc.

They were signed in 1929 when Mussolini had already replaced democratic rules with a dictatorship and it is said that they were a way for him to buy the silence of the church over his actions. In 1984, when both the President and the prime minister were socialists (Pertini and Craxi, respectively) the State reached an agreement with the Church about a revision of the concordat which formally acknowledged many things that had already happened. For example some issues about the State religion: the post-war Constitution of 1948 already established freedom of religion, and previous rulings by the constitutional court on the grounds of religious freedom had already removed the need to take oaths ""before God"", which made atheism perfectly lawful and acceptable, and *de facto* abolished the concept of catholicism as the ""sole faith of the State"". Thus the revision formally abolished a concept of State religion which was already gone, and contained other provisions about marriages, divorces, financing of religious institutions, made religious teaching in schools optional, etc.",Italy,/r/europe/comments/a87x6f/countries_with_state_religion_in_europe/eca5c8m/,gerri_,1545431511

Henry VIII may have split with Rome, but he - and the new Church of England - remained doctrinally Catholic. Transubstantiation, saints, miracles, Marianism, the whole shebang.

His son Edward VI was a boy king and his council was broadly Protestant: they made the C of E Protestant despite a couple of rebellions on the subject.

He dies childless so his sister Mary takes over. She's like the übercatholic queen, reunites the C of E with Rome (which is also now an unpopular thing - more rebellions) and starts burning protestants.

But she also dies childless, so now Elizabeth takes over and she's been raised a protestant. But she's also a pragmatist so while she returns the country to protestantism, she also makes sure the new CofE is just Catholic enough to not piss too many people off. She does persecute Catholics, but mostly only those who are, or ar harbouring, priests - she's been excommunicated so any priest is now a national security threat.

It does when you're considering unemployment. The only reason Iceland didn't face mass unemployment was because of the devalued currency - completely regardless of other countries.

&gt;France and Spain also have seen decent tourism growth

Speaking of unfair comparisons. But even so decent doesn't cut it. The number of tourists in Iceland grew by 600% from 2010 to 2018.

4118,"I couldn't agree more. But, as with all things in the EU, things move very, very slowly. Progress is made in the army department, but it's really small steps, and tbh, I don't know if this progress is permanent. I hope so, but many people are *still* very wary of a European/EU army over here, for obvious historical reasons. And many countries in the EU rather rely on US protection instead of on a European army; they have more trust in the US than in the EU, to put it in other words. Especially nationalist governments aren't fond of the idea of having a European army. And exactly those kinds of governments are on the rise in (parts of) Europe.

About 10 years ago, I started mentioning having a European army, cause we shouldn't rely on others for our own protection. Boy, oh boy, I can't even recall how many times I've been called a new Hitler. Times have changed since then, but it's still a very touchy subject, not in the least part cause it touches the quintessence of a state's sovereignty, and many (if not all) member states, are really edgy when it comes to that. Sadly, if I might add. Cause that kind of attitude prevents the EU/Europe from making real progress.

Greece and Italy should have reformed their economies ages ago already, but the worst thing is, they're *still* not doing it (and to a lesser extent, the same goes for France and some other countries). 

But that is, of course, coming from an NHL perspective, which only adds to the shouting match. I'm well aware of that.

But other than that, I myself am not against some form of circulation of money. *Unless* EU countries don't act in compliance with EU values, which is happening in some EU Member States already. I'm not willing to support rising de facto authoritarianism. Cause well... that's exactly what the EU *isn't* about.

4142,"&gt;  I’ll start over because you don’t see to understand. 

I could say the same.  
  
&gt;You say you earn x y z. This puts you in the top 10% in Germany, kudos. That’s the top EARNERS. This tells me nothing about your net worth personal wealth knowledge about finances investing money management ect...
&gt;This one simple fact shows you haven’t a clue what you are talking about.  
  
Or maybe I understand the difference between earning and networth and was trying to point out I'm not a 20 year old working at a bar. But continue to be a condescending asshole.   
  
&gt;Yet you talk about inheritance wealth which I address. Someone in that family earned that money what right do you have to take it? What makes you think you know how to use it?   
  
You are misconstruing what I said. Your argument was: 

&gt;Essentially you are saying that someone who invests capital, designed the logistics, or scouted and paid the talent to do so.
&gt;You are saying you know better then this person how to allocate assets to achieve greater prosperity for all.
&gt;If this were true you would be the one with the money. Honestly the proof is in the pudding when it comes to capitalism go build the business and prove me wrong.

Your argument was that the fact that these people have money means they are better at producing prosperity to all.  
My counter arguments were that  
a) inheritance - having money doesn't mean that they are better at producing prosperity for all    
b) crime - having accumulated money doesn't mean you are better at producing prosperity for all  
c) wealth gap - having made yourself rich doesn't mean you are better at producing prosperity for all  
The next sentence assumes some sort of completely equal playing field that simply doesn't exist. Being born into a rich family is a massively deciding factor in wealth which today often equals political power.

&gt;Someone in that family earned that money what right do you have to take it?   
  
Inheritance taxes are a thing last I checked. Turns out a lot of rich people got around paying those taxes.
  
&gt;I also address illegal gains. I am not even going. To touch this because if you can’t read between the lines of a drug cartel vs what I am saying then you Are hopeless.   
  
That's a really fancy way of saying ""I can't think of a counterargument and I want to sound like a condescending asshole"".  
I was saying that being a criminal is a pretty great way to make money. Turns out it's not just drug cartels. Companies like Nestle and Bayer are famous for doing pretty horrible shit to make money. Your argument was that these are somehow ""creating prosperity for all"". Sure they create jobs, but they also sold infected blood despite knowing about it's status. Doesn't really seem like they created prosperity for all.

&gt;I never suggested paying taxes is something that is wrong don’t know why you keep harping on that.   
  
I didn't say you did. One of my arguments was that we should redistribute wealth because a large amount of taxes had never been paid and I consider that theft from the people. You make it very easy for yourself by saying ""cheating taxes is bad"", but completely ignore the fact that it is a thing that is happening on a very large scale and a significant amount of rich people are involved. Furthermore, there is the whole lobbying aspect where a lot of money is thrown at politicians all over the world to ensure taxes are kept low for the richest.  
  
&gt;I built the factory with my seed capital you say these workers deserve their cut how much did they put into the initial offering? 0.  
  
A factory does require people to put in their labour. Your definition of fair is that they don't get any of the cut of selling the company. My definition of fair is that they are fairly compensated for their work. That also is a redistribution of wealth.  
  
&gt;Let’s say you lower taxes. Then I can open more factories. Then I can hirers people. Who have more of their pay check because of lower taxes. Then they can take their own money and start their own businesses. If and only if they learn about money.   
  
Except that whenever companies get big tax breaks, all of these promises never or barely materialize. Oh and the fucking infrastructure (which all these companies need to be able to operate at all) start to suffer. I worked in the telecommunications sector for a good while and I saw exactly what happened and it's the same in Germany and the US. The companies ensured that they delivered the least service that they could possibly provide within the legal limit while gaining the most amount of cash. Sure Germany now has a terrible fucking mobile internet connectivity that is behind our eastern European neighbours, but hey, at least Telekom made a lot of money. All that infrastructure would probably have had significant positive effects for a lot of businesses down the line, but that doesn't really matter does it?  
I'm not saying you shouldn't create a business friendly environment, but that's not the same as allowing companies to pay a sliver of what they should.
  
&gt;You are too busy virtue signaling About the plight of the poor.  
  
Sure, carrying about people = virtue signaling.

&gt;The sad thing is you don’t realize this will effect you much much much more then It would ever effect a person of real wealth.
&gt;You up taxes I close factories to continue to meet my bottom line people lose jobs.   
  
Yeah, that's the same sob story the rich habe been crying for centuries whenever taxes are increased. Yet somehow, despite this when taxes go up companies don't suddenly implode.

&gt;Moving your money legally over seas paying a tax professional or learning how to do it on your own (which I did) in about 3 months saved me 100s of thousands. It is 100% legal. this is again a political issue not a financial one.
&gt;Your inability laziness ineptness to do this doesn’t make them evil it makes you lazy.   
  
Well fuck you too.  
The panama papers clearly proved that a lot of the richest people made sure they paid almost no taxes at home. Sure it's legal. But, and not to sound soppy, frankly it's a shitty thing to do. And that really brings me back the point. I could do shitty things to make money, but I don't.   
  
&gt;Yes I hold to libertarian ideals. It’s pretty clear judging by the content of your response who is correct where socioeconomics are concerned, because you are bragging about how much you earn while I am retired at the age of 34. :) sorry to someone like me who grew up and poverty and fought and climbed the way to wealth you come over as a over educated coming from middle to upper middle class good job beginnings trying to tell me what it’s like.   
  
I'm not bragging, I'm distancing myself from people who work for a pittance. And I'm really happy for you if you retired at 34. I have a friend who invested in Bitcoin way early and is a multi millionaire. Clearly this makes him better at discussing socio economics. He put in a few hundred Euros and has double digit millions. Considering his return of investment and the time it took, he is clearly better at money. I called him, he said you are a dickhead. 
  
&gt;You haven’t seen unfettered capitalism. It would be a very different world if you had. Nor did I ever suggest there shouldn’t be any regulation. You go on an on these tangent ideas without first seeking to understand my position.   
  
I didn't say I had seen unfettered capitalism. I said we had. Look at a history book and look how people were treated during the industrial revolution. And the worst is that in many parts of the world this still goes on. We have perfect examples of what happens when companies aren't forced to not be totally horrible. How many fucking sweatshops do gigantic and famous clothing brands have all over the world where they treat people like slaves. Phones are built by slaves.  
The only reason they don't do it here is because when they did, they were fought and they lost. Over there, no one gives a fuck.

&gt;I like at the end how you talk about company’s destroying things... and you want to fund governments with the responsibility?
&gt;Governments specially yours caused two world wars. caused the destruction of most of the world. Not that my government or any other government hasn’t done horrible things just short of that.   
  
Imperialism, Monarchies and Fascism started two world wars. We live in Democracies now. I have far more trust in a democracy than I do a company. Because a company has exactly one goal. MAKE MONEY. Every single good thing companies do now had to be forced from them. 5 Day workweeks. Sick days. Paid Leave. Child Care. Decent Wages. Abolishing child work.   
Every single thing had to be wrestled from them and EVERY SINGLE TIME they cried about how paying their workers decent wages and not mutilating children would cause the economy to collapse because they couldn't meet their bottom line. And each time, it turned out to be bullshit, just like your line of argument.

4251,"&gt;It wasn’t 50.01% it was 51.89%. That’s almost a million and a half people. 

Precise numbers are irrelevant, it's enough that it was 50% + 1 which is called simple majority.

&gt;If they vote again and it’s the same percentages but flipped then why wouldn’t there be calls for a third vote? 

Exactly my point. If you go with simple majority for long term changes you'll have this problem each year you could have a different result. So please explain to me if you have 50% + 1 now for staying in EU why would you not follow the ""democratic will of the people""?

&gt;The aristocratic mindset is so deep in people in Europe it’s actually horrifying.

4258,"&gt; ""That you are working and on top of it costs you money can not be, in the end they will take everything away"". The cooperative of Benifaió had collected 600 boxes (about 9,000 kilos) of the tangerine field that José Garcés has in the Sangonera game, in the Algemesí area, when the persistent rains arrived. There was almost 50% of the harvest in the trees, but the ""pixat"" appeared and the cooperative ruled out taking more fruit. Garcés decided to cut literally for the sake of it. He contacted some people who are interested in firewood and, in exchange for this raw material, he has cut all the orange trees in a field of four hanegadas. At 80 years old and with a large part of his life dedicated to agriculture - «at 9 years old they took me out of school to go to the fields and collaborate in the rice plantation with light work», remember- he has decided to finally throw in the towel. «It has been wrong for me to cut some trees in full production. Just to keep the field I would have kept it for distracting me, because I do not know how to stand, but you're fed up and you feel helpless because we farmers can not do it anymore, I cut it because I do not get any benefit, ""says Pepe Garcés, who already there is no question of replanting anything. If anything, one-year crops that do not give too much work.
&gt; 
&gt; This farmer from Benifaió had not secured the harvest and, according to reports, does not regret it. ""Something similar happened to me two years ago. They took only half of the fruit and around 10,000 kilos they paid me 400 euros when the insurance cost me 500 pesos, I'm not interested ». 
&gt; Garcés is critical of all parties because he considers that ""no government"" has bet on the sector and especially regrets the treatment received by the farmer in the labor inspections that are being carried out. ""People who go to the camp have us as if we were criminals, if the helicopter passes and a gang goes to the Civil Guard and surrounds the entire field, only the scare you take even if they are all insured is no longer worth it"" comment
&gt; 
&gt; This Orogrante tangerine field was barely affected by the hail and, according to the owner, the harvest was of quality. In fact, he points out that despite the ""pixat"" of some oranges, there was still a lot of fruit in good condition, ""but it's not worth money"", apostille. The cooperative has not yet practiced the liquidation, although it predicts that it will be scarce. He refused to collect the fruit for industry since, according to his presentation, if one takes into account the price paid and the cost of collecting a box, there is hardly any profit margin. ""In this chain everyone is paid and if at the end something is left, that is what the farmer takes away"", he laments.

Most of the corporate and administrative structure of the Congo Free State were Belgian. The newspapers who denounced whistle-blowers and investigators were Belgian. Information about the atrocities committed were still kept secret by the Belgian government for decades. And Belgium still has monuments and architecture paid for in blood and is charging for admission to a museum filled with stolen materials. 

I don't think Belgian citizens today have any responsibility for the events of the past, but I would expect a clear-eyed view of it at least.

4416,"&gt;What do you think differentiates a prototypical fascist state from Francoist Spain?

Fascism is a revolutionary ideology, Franco was a traditional nationalist and conservative a carlist  monarchist, who sought to keep traditional elements and structures of society like the church central to spanish life. Franco also never had a mass populist movement of any sorts, for instance like the blackshirts or brownshirts, the nationalists comprised of various ideological elements, If we are talking about the regime as a whole  the Spanish falange was very much sidelined during his rule in place of carlists and   Opus Dei catholics

&amp;#x200B;

So overall I would say Francoist spain was missing many of the key revolutionary ideological elements that you could find in fascist italy. This is of course the view of the vast majority of scholars and historians so really one should ask you what you think is similar as the notion he was a fascist is straying from consensus ",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/a88fh5/45_years_ago_today_an_underground_bomb_launched/ec8vfw7/,TheBritishHistorian,1545394722

4440,"I think there are two very different and important talking points that get mixed up in Europe. 

When people say ""multicultural""  they actually mean ""multi racial"". 

I am originally from Belgium, I don't care if someone is black, white, chinese or brown. But if we don't all agree on certain things (like male/famale equality, gay rights, freedom of speech and yes also freedom to ridicule, secularity) then theres no point having a multicultural society. 

And guess what.... The secular liberal democratic values that I find very important ARE an ESSENTIAL part of European (at least western) culture in the past 50 years. Most people arriving DO NOT SHARE these. And from my experience even after 3 generations you still have people wanting to mix only with their own individual sub-culture in the host country. 

I have a huge problem and issue with culture. Culture is not RACE. 

I don't wish to live beside neo-nazis as I don't wish to live beside jihadi apologising strict muslims. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now the problem in my eyes is that there are many racists misusing these terms. A racist doesn't really care about someoones culture, they just don't like brown/black people in their country and they feel threatened by it. 

&amp;#x200B;

If 100.000 secular Iranians moved to any European country they wouldn't leave much of a cultural impact besides them looking different and there being an influx of new food. I have many secular friends from the middle-east and especially Iran. These are IMO some of the best integrating immigrants... 

&amp;#x200B;

But yes, I do have a huge problem with culture. It's almost becoming a meme in Sweden. I loved in Gothenburg for 6 months and I met and talked with many ""swedish"" muslims. All seem to have a certain hate for Sweden, think it is not diverse enough and have a general attitude that Sweden is theirs to change and do whatever they want with. 

&amp;#x200B;

Me myself, I want a secular liberal europe. 

&amp;#x200B;

As such immigration helps reduce the strain and many end up working in their jobs.

I also think the problem that you described is often more with 2nd and 3rd generation immigrants, while the newer immigrants tend to want to quite actively become part of that culture.

Tariffs are simply not a real problem since both sides mostly agree they don't want any. Non tariff barriers like filling out the correct paperwork and simply waiting to cross the border on the other hand will make certain businesses completely impossible. For example Turkey is in the customs union and trucks often wait 6-12 hours to cross the border into Bulgaria. Sometimes during particularly busy periods it can be 3-4 days.

That headline can be true at the same time as church attendance numbers are dropping massively and many of the buildings and grounds are starting to become neglected as the number of members of the church themselves become ever smaller. As an example, a local church in my town used to hold Taizé masses back in the '90s that used to draw huge crowds. This church had a convent attached where an order of nuns lived, and they would keep the gardens looking breathtaking. My sister visited this church to see about her wedding and came away saying the place was looking very rundown, the gardens were gone and looking miserable. The Taizé masses have stopped, the nuns are gone so nobody is looking after the gardens, there is just nobody there to maintain the place. Multiple former convents are now for sale here and across the country.

Similarly, I witnessed for myself the enormous drop in attendence at the mass rock event that happened every year here, which my grandparents would help in setting up. I haven't been there since the early '90s but even in the '80s up until my last visit I saw the huge difference in crowds attending these masses.

BERLIN—Europe faces its largest journalistic scandal in years after Der Spiegel, the continent’s biggest-selling news magazine, said one of its star reporters fabricated facts in his articles for years.

The magazine’s disclosure, which came after a colleague raised concerns about a recent piece on supporters of President Trump in rural America, was made as Europe’s established media faces attacks by populist forces at home and abroad.

Claas Relotius, an award-winning journalist, resigned from the magazine last week after admitting to making up parts of his reporting in the past decade, Der Spiegel said late Wednesday.

Mr. Relotius couldn’t be reached for comment.

According to the magazine, Mr. Relotius, 33, invented characters, dialogue and events in his coverage of subjects ranging from a Guantanamo inmate who no longer wanted to leave the prison to civil war orphans in Syria.

“We must see what control mechanisms failed, whether they did or whether we were negligent,” Steffen Klusmann, who will become the magazine’s editor in chief next year, said in a video interview posted on the magazine’s website.

Major news organizations have faced a number of crises in recent decades over reporting that was later determined to contain fabricated material.

In seven years writing for Der Spiegel, Mr. Relotius became one of Germany’s most highly regarded journalists, accumulating 10 coveted awards.

But in a separate video interview on the magazine’s website, a colleague said he raised an alarm in November about some facts in an article he and Mr. Relotius co-authored about a pro-Trump militia, which the article described as hunting down immigrants along Arizona’s border with Mexico.

On Wednesday, the magazine launched what it called a transparency campaign, pledging to investigate Mr. Relotius’ entire body of work and publicize the results. It said it had so far found made-up facts in 14 out of nearly 60 articles.

Stefan Niggemeier, an independent media blogger in Berlin and a former Spiegel journalist, said some of the articles at issue appeared to confirm certain German stereotypes about Trump voters, asking “was this possible because of an ideological bias?”

A spokesman for Der Spiegel said that the magazine is investigating what if any role potential bias may have played.

Founded in 1947, Der Spiegel built its reputation on its investigative work and, especially in its early years, its critical coverage of government. In Germany, where news and opinion writing often merge, it is known for its center-left leanings.

The affair cast doubt on the effectiveness of Der Spiegel’s renowned fact-checking department, once described as the largest in the world by the Columbia Journalism Review. The magazine, which said it employs around 70 fact-checkers, said its system had failed.

“We have always found that excellent journalism requires a certain amount of freedom. We don’t want to control our colleagues every step of the way,” the magazine said this week. “We want them to be able to let themselves drift, which is the only way to create creativity. But it must not become too creative either.”

In a post on Medium on Wednesday, two residents of Fergus Falls, Minn., described what they said were numerous inaccuracies in an article by Mr. Relotius that Der Spiegel published last year and that focused on Fergus Falls, Minn. The article was titled “In a Small Town.”

Michele Anderson, program director for a local nonprofit, and Jake Krohn, a technology consultant, wrote in the post, “what kind of institutional breakdown led to the supposedly world-class Der Spiegel fact-checking team completely dropping the ball on this one.”

In response to questions from The Wall Street Journal, Ms. Anderson wrote in an email that none of the people she spoke with in Fergus Falls referenced in the Der Spiegel article were approached for fact-checking by the magazine.

In an article Wednesday, Der Spiegel wrote that Mr. Relotius “distorts reality” in the article about Fergus Falls. A spokesman for the magazine said that Der Spiegel’s fact-checking process “does not include contacting any subjects of articles,” adding that the department reviews each story sentence by sentence for accuracy and plausibility, followed by a review between the department and the story’s author.

Senior Spiegel reporters told The Wall Street Journal that their own experience was one of strict fact-checking.",,/r/europe/comments/a84jtf/germanys_der_spiegel_says_reporter_made_up_facts/ec8a24x/,[deleted],1545365981

4884," For the fact, the guy made up around half of the around 55 stories he made, in a way that he added to,  basically rewrote, existing stories on the internet. One of these stories, about a problem already existing before Trump,  actually was his downfall. He reported about a self declared border control guy, who is famous in his area. The fraud came out, as his co author was brave enough to research the story on his own cost to prove the writer wrong. He figured that the guy exist and does what the author claims, but the interview part was made up.

As far as I am aware, the refuge finding money story exist, but was not published by the guy. 
If I am not wrong, the cnn award wasn't for that border control story either. He spun several stories about Syria and victims of the war. The award he got for his powerful and great insight into the mind of a child affected by the war. Sad, that the reason he got the award, the insight into a human mind which really should be the goal of every journalist, was the part he faked the most. Basically his favourite kind of tool for writing,  was making up the perfect moment,  underlining it with music just playing in the background like in some Hollywood movie.

So in short, aside from the fact that his last story was about the states, it had nothing to do with Trump, and it should be actually seen kind of positive that some other journalist from the same newspaper and the paper itself made it public. They easily could have swept it under the rug, but threatened their own reputation for the truth.

Do you have any idea how to talk to people?

One of the more solid borders that I have seen is the one between North and South Korea.  Some of the easier ones I have seen are between EU states.  The longest undefended border that I have seen would be between the US and Canada.  

If the UK crashes out in March they can decide what they do or do not want their side and Ireland gets to decide what they do or do not want on their side.  Hopefully they can cooperate but the Eu does not seem to understand the concept so we will see.  

As for the WTO, when are they going to start actually enforcing whatever they refer to as ""rules""?  They certainly do not seem to enforce them with China.

5115,"\&gt;  Individuals can invoke European law directly, regardless of the existence of legislation in national law.   


As I already pointed out, EU law and national law have the exact same standing. So of course you can invoke EU law just as you can national law. But there isn't his ""pick and choose"" as you are implying. If there is a conflict between two laws it is always the newer law that takes precedence, which is by virtue going to be the EU law if one exists because if you overruled the rules of the organization you would not longer be allowed to remain a member.  


\&gt;  Say for example If a judge does not rule in my favour because of our national laws, I can go directly to the European court of justice. And in the end, their decision will be final. 

&amp;#x200B;

The Judge and the ECJ will both be adjudicating based on the same set of laws. The only way you could appeal to the ECJ is if you had sufficient argument to say the first judge had incorrectly interpreted the law. Its not the case as you are implying that your local judge will decide based on national law, but the ECJ can overrule them based on EU law as both are indistinguishable from the perspective of the courts.  


\&gt;  European laws must implemented In to national law. If they do that ""incorrectly"" (for instance if it's not something they really want, or because it's against the constitution) th european court of justice will rule in favour of the one challenging that.  


Correct, but the EU is forbidden by its own treaties to implement a law that violates the national constitution of a member state exactly because they would be unenforceable. The ECJ has no power to preside over a case involving a conflict with a national constitution and thus could never give a ruling. If for whatever reason the EU did pass a law which was in violation of lets say Ireland's constitution, all that would happen (apart from a rather loud political crisis) would be that the Supreme Court of Ireland would rule it unconstitutional and the law would cease to have effect in Ireland. The ECJ would have no authority to appeal or rule one way or the other and you'd then get into a political debate as to whether the EU change their law or Ireland changes their constitution or Ireland just leaves the EU entirely.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/a7z13r/a_short_history_of_second_referendums_on_europe/ec7lfee/,codge214,1545344427

Why would spain deport people pumping their pensions and UK government healthcare payments into the local economy? What next, are they going to ban UK tourists?

 

&gt;because they sure as fuck don't have a plan to handle the sudden return of that many people without jobs, or homes or assets in the UK.

&gt;It's not - both create value for themselves. The worker would not be able to create that value on his own and therefore he works for the manager, who can both make him produce that level of value, at a lower risk

He cannot create the value on his own, True! He needs the tools, the machinery, etc. Where do these come from? Work. Someone else made them. The capitalist doesn't provide it, the workers who produced the tools machinery etc did. Labor is prior to, and independent of, capital. Capital is only the fruit of labor, and could never have existed if labor had not first existed.

5203,"&gt; No one is talking, or at least I'm not talking and neither is Macron for the implementation of fees 

The Prime minister is. And again, for the rest : you're looking at it from an elitist point of view, it works in elitists countries, not in egalitarians. For example, the first change that the current government did (the new platform) lead to a huge issue : now students have to be selected, and between the child of a rich family who did work in dad's company, went to other countries and the child of a poor family with no working experience who didn't traveled, the first one was nearly always selected. So selection for university goes against equality, not in favour of it.


&gt; You skipped everything I said and how the poor aren't actually taxed more.

APL decrease. Tax increase for the lower middle class. I mean, okay, we're all stupid and misunderstanding the clever government that we have, but, at one point, when so many people from so many different background come and say ""I'm poor, my tax increased"", you can't just stand and say ""no they didn't"", they know better than you how much money they have at the end of the month...

&gt; Economic policy of the kind I'm talking about has nothing to do with culture,egalitarianism or family values.

No, because economics are a hard science about rational actors. Seriously, we're talking about politics, obviously it has to do with what the people want, how they see their life and what their values are. The same idea might be good in the eyes of the Brits and bad in the eyes of the French. There is no objectively good answer in politics, because if there was, we'll just have a cast of scientists leading the world with their cold and objective science and not little group of democracies disagreeing on fundamental principles like how the economy should work and what objective is the most important in a given situation.

&gt; You mean when the socialist government...

Who had Macron as minister of the economy and was heavily criticized by the left wing because they did nothing for the people and by the right wing because their policies were absolutely stupid ? Also the same government that gave companies 40 billions euros as a gift because ""they'll create a million jobs if we do"" which did absolutely nothing ?

&gt; I fail to see how individual freedoms are against an equal society but ok.

Liberal in the economics sense. You're applying liberal ideas : we should loosen workers right, lower taxes on companies, etc. These ideas don't work in France, they never did, they never will.

&gt; to the point where you said nothing of substance since you don't actually speak for the entire country nor do yo actually represent everyone's feelings.

So I'll note that a renown demographer's entire life of work on the political consequences of family structures and the link between old family structures and the rise or fall of political ideologies that led said scientist to write an essay on the entire history of mankind explained via this information alone is ""emotional"". I could had the entire work of economists like Bernard Friot on the communists roots of the French public services and the pseudo-communist revolution that lead to them and the birth of a true anti-capitalist culture in France which, when you add Todd's ""return of the ancient cultures"" theory would explain why suddenly French are starting to question and reject (economical) liberal ideas which do not have any roots here, while socialist and communist ideas do, but again, ""emotional"".

Well then, we're left with the one and only hard science that deals with human beings : liberal economics, and it is saying that we shouldn't think because it's a hard science and gravity doesn't go up. So let's not think I guess ?

&gt; You can't just protest without having some kind of demands.

They had one : to remove the tax. He ignored them. Now they have a new one : they demand a new presidential election.

&gt; Be more specific than pointing at finance and demanding some mythical tax.

Yellow jackets aren't more precise. They're tired of seeing money only go one way. If you want me to be more precise, I'll follow Frédéric Lordon's advice, he's an economist, and say : ""wait for the next finance crash, buy the banks off for a symbolic euro, put the primary market on one side as its own community-ruled system, and for the rest : close finance once and for all"".

&gt; The ONLY law that was passed specifically for rich people was the removal of the ""Impôt sur la Fortune"", which was scientifically a terrible, terrible tax 

Which is, again paraphrasing Lordon, a gift and nothing else as 99.7% of the money that was taken by this tax won't come back into the economy : it may not have been a good tax, but removing it is still a huge gift. Also you missed the end of the exit tax, and the fact that nearly all of the pro-middle class reforms will start next year (or are so tiny that they're a joke) while the pro-rich reforms have already gone through.

I mean this is government that said, when they've lowered the APL, ""we're gonna ask apartment owner to lower the price to compensate"" and who now, when they see people pissed off because they don't have any money, say ""we're gonna ask companies to give money"". When it's for the workers or the middle class in general, it's optional, when it's for the rich, it isn't.

&gt; On the contrary, the increase of the CSG hits the wealthy because it taxes CAPITAL gains, which is something I'm sure you're very happy about, right ? 

Which, before the yellow jackets revolt, was going to also hit a lot of not so wealthy retired people, who when they worked were told that ""we're taking your money and giving it to your parents"", and now our told ""we're taking your money and giving it to your children""...

&gt; What about the ""poverty plan"" ? It's seen by the social sector as one of the best social plans ever written by a government, because it really tackles the root issues of poverty in France . Why are you ignoring that.

My entire family works in social institutions, I can tell you, not a single one of them told me it was ""the best social plan"", and even if it was, it's overshadowed by the rest.

&gt; You say you want more public services but Macron's government HAS INCREASED PUBLIC SPENDING.

I must have missed something, you mean they've addressed the hospitals closing, the people dying in hospitals because you have to wait for hours because of a lack of doctors, the hospitals running out of pills and tools and unable to repair their machines because of lack of funds, the citizens who don't get health because it cost too much to them, the schools with 35+ children per class, the low-wages zones with awful school because no budget, the justice system that is crawling because of a lack of people working there and who's being ""optimized"" which lead to even more overwork for the few places that aren't closed, the postal services that have been closed or the research world's general lack of fund ?

They've tried to fix one of them, the one that is, in the eyes of the yellow jackets, based on what they say, the least important and the only one they've not been screaming about. Sorry, that's

5209,"I don't think capitalism with strict regulations it would work. For starters it'd be basically be the same as the current system, just with some stricter regulations, but the fundamental social dynamics would be the same and it'd just be a matter of time before the capitalists manage to erode regulations to non-strict levels. 

But the fundamental problem would be that you'd try to balance the power of one class (the capitalists) by expanding the power of another class (the politicians). Even if we didn't live in a society where the politicians are basically in the pocket of the capitalists already, replacing the rule of the capitalist class with the rule of the political class doesn't sound like much of an improvement to me. Because the social dynamics of society isn't going to change or improve drastically if we merely put a different small group of people in charge of our economy. (Let's not pretend that in even representative democracy the people are really in control.) Instead we should aim to abolish class society, not try to balance the power of the different classes.

The group of political ideologies called [Libertarian Socialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarian_socialism), which is a subset of socialist ideologies that reject the state and central control of the economy, represents the ""third system"" you're looking for I think. A good part of the mass revolutionary workers movements of the first half of the previous century found their theoretical basis in syndicalist or anarchist ideologies because it rejects rule of both the capitalist and the politician.

5234,"Plenty of them are pretty bad to be honest and not just the economic ones.

&gt;National identity

This is one is one of the better ones but you can encourage assimilation and put a lot of efforts into ensuring that immigrants do.

&gt;Isolation, separation and stability

Same point as before but generally immigration isn’t something that people do lightly and they actively want to take part in the culture. It is also often happens where second generation immigrants become less intergraded than their parents but there is stuff that could be done about that, to make them part of the culture.

&gt;Increased competition

The job market is extremely flexible and can accommodate more immigrant, immigrants also create more jobs. Especially as demand goes up supply meets it.

&gt;Environmental space, quality and resource scarcity

Practically every country has enough space and resources to accommodate them. Plenty of places are also quite inefficient at using resources and land area with quite stringent regulations that negatively impact that stuff so they have a lot to do. 

&gt;Diseases

Not really an issues anymore given how connected the world is 

&gt;Immigrant crime

As the article says people overstate the link between immigrants and crime, sometimes by quite a lot. The article also says in the USA there is no impact on the overall crime rate and that is generally the case elsewhere and if it isn’t there is normally some other problems causing it.

&gt;Military unity

Military loyalty is generally pretty bad among the general population and first gen immigrants tend to be more patriotic because they actively want to be there and put in a lot of effort. In many countries non citizens do join another country’s military, France for example has the foreign legion which use to grant you automatic French citizenship and even now they can apply within [three years] (https://en.legion-recrute.com/mdl/info_seul.php?id=39&amp;block=26&amp;titre=Can-a-) opposed to having to live in France five years as part of the criteria for naturalisation. So it clear that it does happen and some countries have set aside provisions to cover it.

&gt;Dangerous journeys

Dangerous journeys happen because they are desperate to leave their country and this becomes more so by designating them illegal.  Rather than allowing them to go through official channels, also contrary to popular belief many do come in legally and then find them in violation of their visa conditions do become illegal that way.

&gt;Import of culture
 
Plenty of immigrants do put in effort to assimilate with there being pressure to do so, as such this doesn’t really apply to many of them and there is a lot that you can do to encourage that.

&gt;Welfare costs

Immigrants pay taxes and governments often do restrict welfare, in the USA immigrants aren’t allowed to access it for five years. While freedom of movement means that citizens from EEA countries have to be treated largely equally, in the UK they are net contributors paying significantly more than they take out. [They contribute £2,300 more than the average UK adult] (https://www.oxfordeconomics.com/recent-releases/8747673d-3b26-439b-9693-0e250df6dbba).

&gt;Damage to migrants' home countries

I can just copy from that article for this one

However, the notion of a ""brain drain"" remains largely unsupported in the academic literature. According to economist Michael Clemens, it has not been shown that restrictions on high-skill emigration reduce shortages in the countries of origin.[68] According to development economist Justin Sandefur, ""there is no study out there... showing any empirical evidence that migration restrictions have contributed to development

Ireland:

&gt; a) In the so-called ""Nice II referendum"" in 2002, statements on Ireland not having to join a common defence policy and affirming the right to decide on enhanced cooperation in the national parliament were stressed in a special document, resulting in a favourable vote.

&gt; b) After the first vote by Ireland on the Lisbon Treaty, the European Council and the Irish Government released separate documents, referred to as the ""Irish Guarantees"", that stated the other member countries would not use the possibility in the Treaty to diminish the number of permanent commissioners in favour of a rotating system with fewer commissioners, and not threaten Ireland's military neutrality and rules on abortion.[1][2] With these assurances, the Irish approved the unchanged Lisbon Treaty in a second referendum.

5368,"&gt;The EU is refusing to negotiate at all and the only offer they have made requires the UK to remain under EU control until the EU agrees to let them go and does not give the UK any voice in the rules. That is not a Brexit.

But *that is the result of negotiations with Theresa May and no one has claimed it was not negotiated*. No other country nor any international organization has claimed EU did not negotiate. That's just your personal view.

Just because the outcome does not please you does not mean it was not negotiated. You have to get used to the fact that UK is a smaller entity than the EU, and EU has much more negotiating power-

There never was a clear definition of what ""Brexit"" is. Many Brexit promises where lies and impossible promises. And as those lies and impossible promises failed to become reality in negotiations, it's silly to blame the EU for ""not negotiating"". If someone promises that you will get a time machine aftert brexit but EU negotiations do not provide that, it's silly to say ""EU did not negotiate because we did not get a time machine and so this is not brexit"".

Norway is under much control of EU without a say in the matters of EU. Still it is not in the EU.

And you have completely ignored the fact that the current deal was *deal for the transition period*. Article 50 requires to negotiate a whitdrawl agreement, *a deal which defines how the whitdrawl will happen*. That's what the deal is, *a transition period of whitdrawl*. UK remains in customs union and such *for the transition period* and the idea is to negotiate the relations post-transition period during the transition period. The deal literally inclues more negotiations.
If what you say is true, *UK could have sued the EU to European Court of Justice, but they did not, because UK is fully aware EU did negotiate*.

So even the UK has the view EU did negotiate. So you are alone with your claims.

&gt;As for what makes me think the EU does not negotiate in good faith, every Brexit negotiation for the last two years. 

*How can you use negotiatons as an argument if you claimed EU does not negotiate?* You cannot refer to existing negotiations if you also claim negotiations did not happen. You cannot say EU does not negotiate in good faith, but you cannot make such a claim at the same time you say EU does not negotiate.

So, if you claim EU negotiates in bad faith and every negotiation for the past two years demonstrates this, then you have to accept EU did negotiatet.

&gt;Also how they negotiated or more specificly refused to negotiate the PA and IA. 

I'm not familiar with those initials. What are you referring to?

(What I'm saying is: a compromise isn't always a good thing, if you're compromising with something really bad).

Of course: what is a good system of governance, and what is a bad one? That needs to be debated with **logic, data**.

Now, that doesn't mean that all the left (non-capitalists) are correct. Some proposed structural systemic changes would work, others are also logically flawed.

Again, we need to use science, logic, data, to optimize our way of governance.

Edit: And yes, the far-right is just doubling down on the flaws of capitalism, with an authoritarian/totalitarian, militaristic/nationalist mindset, so.... no thanks.

5424,"&gt;There has been a shit load of growth in the west since 2008, but not a lot of it seems to have arrived with the ""common man"". Might be a good first step towards some redistribution of the wealth.

The German researcher Oliver Nachtwey published a very good article about this in the NY Times recently, where he builds upon this thesis: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/07/opinion/merkel-germany-christian-democrats.html

Many people feel betrayed by the politicians that clandestinely terminated what we call the ""social contract"": Basically, after the war, everyone agreed that we should be a welfare state built upon individual rights, stability and economic growth that would in turn benefit the workers. While we had all that, wages didn't rise and workers rights were eroded under Schröder's Agenda 2010 - he established the biggest low wage sector in Europe. One in three employees now is precariously employed, meaning they have time-limited contracts, cannot save money, and unexpected expenses can bankrupt them. This lead to a declining middle class and increased social inequality, and fear of social descent all along the population spectrum. 

It's a dangerous path, because these groups now have terminated their support for the mainstream parties and turned to extreme right alternatives (the AfD is now the strongest party in some areas). It's only a matter of time before the same happens on the extreme left side, and suddenly we're back in 1925 and Germany becomes ungovernable.

5503,"&gt; Been wondering since Day 1 why the police weren't siding with the protestors

For starters, because ""the police"" is composed of different individuals who certainly hold different opinions on the protests. Some might be in favour of them, others against them, others will hold mixed ideas, or be uncertain about it. When the police as a whole joins a protest it is not a protest anymore, it is a coup. Do you want a coup?

But mostly, because the job of the police is to enforce the laws, by e.g. stopping the rioters from destroying and burning stuff and terrorising people. If the police do not do that, who will? The army? Private militias? Is this what you want?

Our police officers solve it by holding ""stipheidsacties"" which means they do alcohol checks right in the middle of morning/evening traffic at the worst possible place and take their sweet time by obeying all regulations to the letter and stuff.

5520,"If north Macedonians still viewed themselves as Bulgarians as they did for the last thousand years, it would certainly be viewed as a Bulgarian dialect. The South slavic languages are divided into south west and south east, south west contains croatian-bosnian-serbian and slovenian, south east slavic Bulgarian and macedonian. That's only an example to illustrate, it 
is a very similar language at its core. However obviously after the balkan wars and after world war 2, it was first under attempted serbianization in the serb dominated kingdom of yugoslavia, and after world war 2 heavy serbo-croatian influence in communist yugoslavia, so no matter its roots, it became influenced by serbo-croatian, and the people learned serbo-croatian fluently as a second language etc. 

Also, Bulgarian is divided into east and western dialects, imagine the western dialects continuing into north macedonia. Bulgaria picked an eastern dialects as its standard, so Standard Bulgarian, which makes the divide go a bit further.

Since various mass media began reporting on the practice in the mid-1990s, in part as a commentary on urban Scotland's notoriously unhealthy diet,[1] the popularity of the dish has spread.

5707,"It doesn't cover all bottles. Contrary to single-use deposit, the reuse deposit system is voluntary. Since it's in the interest of the company that fills the bottles, there's no law that forces anyone to have a deposit on their reusable containers. 

Glass bottles containing beer, water and soft drinks are usually reused, so they have deposits. Bottles for other alcoholic drinks are basically not reused. Some retail chains have deposits for 1 liter wine bottles. That's why the mulled wine I buy comes in 0.97 liter bottles. ;)


The large Ehrmann yoghurt jars are basically the only non-drink glass container I know that is reused and has a deposit. I've heard there are honey jars that are reused as well, but I've never encountered them. But it's possible that I threw them away without collecting the deposit. After all I threw away a couple yoghurt jars before I realised they have a deposit. 

If it makes sense to use these glass jars instead of single-use plastic is questionable.

5745,"You're missing the point. A piece of code can be beautiful, but it's a product of the content of the code relative to the form (i.e. the language in essence). This solution is incredibly efficient and logical in Python, but horrible in Javascript, for example. The form alone is a contentless set of rules for the construction of structures. 

In natural language terms, I can appreciate that this poem in English is very beautiful and that the German translation doesn't remotely do it justice, just as I can appreciate that this German poem is very beautiful and that English translation makes it sound trite and unremarkable. But the beauty lies in *this* structure that was achieved through the application of a certain set of rules to some kind of mental content in order to produce the poem. Applying a different set of rules to the same mental content doesn't produce a structure of equal beauty, but applying those rules to something else will. 

That's why you can't say the Germanic languages lost ""grammatical beauty"" through discarding their case system. They lost one set of potentials but gained a whole new set in doing so. 

Goethe doesn't really work in a language without a case system any more than Shakespeare works in a language with one. Calling a case system ""beautiful"" is a classic mistake of something that there's something inherently beautiful about the rules of a language.

If you're willing to allow *all* kinds of discrimination then that's a fair opinion to have. Plenty of people will disagree with it but at least you're not just allowing certain types of discrimination and calling that fair.

Look, I worked with data. It can be easily designed to represent whatever you want. Especially when we're talking on data based on human actions (like police getting informed about X or Y). And if we're talking about a country where society approves a certain type of murders (OK, it's not the case for Morocco, they say, let's talk an abstract country), would be really weird to expect them reported and counted, especially when we talk about an international level. To be honest, I'm quite sure all the stats gets heavily adjusted when it comes to the state level. I saw it adjusted in my area which was relatively innocent and not even close to reputation or country image. I saw it collected wrongly and processed god knows how. Why wouldn't one expect the same everywhere. 

Apart from that and closer to the topic, great to know Morocco is more safe. Maybe you're right and this murder has nothing to do with religion. Or overall lifestyle difference. Or income level (tourists get killed for the stuff quite often while travelling in the poor countries). I'm not saying it's only religion to be considered in this case, there are more factors which make this quite a bad idea.
