BRUSSELS—U.S. officials are preparing to test Moscow’s willingness to end the Ukraine conflict by seeking Russia’s approval for 20,000 peacekeepers across Ukraine’s embattled east, U.S. and Western officials said.
&gt;
The U.S. is expected to raise the proposal with Russian officials in coming days, these people said. It is driven by hopes in some Western capitals, including Paris and Berlin, that Russian President Vladimir Putin is seeking a way out of Moscow’s military support to Ukrainian separatists.
&gt;
The proposal is also part of a larger Trump administration strategy for Russia that includes diplomatic efforts to force Moscow back into compliance with arms-control treaties, such as a ban on intermediate missiles that Washington has accused Russia of violating.
&gt;
Western capitals remain skeptical, however, that Russia will fulfill its commitments under the 2015 Minsk peace accords, obliging it to pull all troops and weapons out of Ukraine and allow Kiev to restore control.
&gt;
The U.S. proposal would respond to a Russian initiative put forth at the United Nations Security Council in New York in September, calling for a peacekeeping mission.
&gt;
Russia proposed that peacekeepers protect international observers in Ukraine along the so-called separation line that divides Kiev-controlled territory from rebel-held areas in the east. The conflict in eastern Ukraine erupted in 2014 after Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine. Fighting has left some 10,000 dead.
&gt;
Western diplomats dismissed Russia’s proposal because they feared it would effectively freeze the conflict, perpetuating rebel control of parts of Ukraine’s Donbas region.
&gt;
Mr. Putin responded positively to a counterproposal from German Chancellor Angela Merkel that peacekeepers be granted free access throughout Donbas, Russian and Western officials said.
&gt;
Russia’s role in the Ukrainian conflict is the biggest obstacle to improving ties between Moscow and Washington, Western and Russian officials said. U.S. President Donald Trump has said repeatedly he hopes to improve ties with Moscow. The two leaders may meet on the sidelines of an economic summit in Vietnam on Friday.
&gt;
The White House didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
&gt;
The September peacekeeping proposal “was a serious signal from the Kremlin,” said Vladimir Chizhov, Russia’s ambassador to the European Union. Progress in Ukraine, he said, could improve “the hugely abnormal situation in Russian-American relations.”
&gt;
The U.S. envoy to Ukraine, Kurt Volker, has since the summer met with Ukrainian and Russian officials on the Donbas conflict. Those talks have run parallel to formal negotiations on the conflict, involving Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany.
&gt;
Mr. Volker has met twice with top Kremlin aide Vladislav Surkov since mid-August. A third meeting is planned in Belgrade next week.
&gt;
Trump administration officials said they believe progress is best achieved by taking several big steps toward fulfilling the Minsk accords instead of trying to make incremental progress. Minsk committed Russia to letting Ukraine restore authority across its territory in exchange for Kiev holding local elections in Donbas and agreeing to greater autonomy for its eastern regions.
&gt;
Officials briefed on the U.S. initiative said obstacles to a deal with Russia on peacekeepers are formidable, but an agreement could be reached if Russia is willing to negotiate.
&gt;
“It is not impossible, which is interesting,” a U.S. official said.
&gt;
Mr. Volker said last week he was exploring with Mr. Surkov how Russia’s September peacekeeping proposal “can be developed further” to make it effective for controlling contested areas, monitoring heavy weapons and policing the Ukrainian side of the border.
&gt;
“We are not in agreement on this yet,” Mr. Volker said.
&gt;
U.S. and Western officials say a mission may not operate under a U.N. Security Council mandate. Peacekeepers could instead operate under the auspices of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, whose monitors are already in Ukraine, or be a more ad hoc coalition, the officials said.
&gt;
Mr. Volker said last week the U.S. has spoken about Ukraine with diplomats from Sweden, a non-NATO country. Sweden, which has taken a firmly pro-Kiev stance since the Ukraine conflict erupted, has frequently volunteered for peacekeeping missions in the past.
&gt;
Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, meanwhile, on Thursday said her government is making a significant diplomatic push for a U.N. peacekeeping force in Ukraine.
&gt;
Several U.S. officials said the White House has approved in principle providing Ukraine lethal weapons, including Javelin antitank weapons. No decision has been taken on when such weapons could be provided.
&gt;
The officials said that the weapons could be used to persuade a skeptical Ukrainian government, facing major domestic opposition in parliament, to embrace the peacekeeping effort. They could also be used to signal to Moscow that the West is ready to increase its military support, should the peacekeeping effort fail.",The Netherlands,/r/europe/comments/7bzapy/us_to_seek_russian_approval_for_peacekeepers_in/dplz7a6/,DetlefKroeze,1510293718

71,"Oh, FFS.

&gt;Will it also want to move away from the European model?”

The UK accepting US production standards to permit import of US goods hardly entails changing the ""model"" society uses.

&gt;so the U.K. will have to choose which legislation it aligns itself with.

It's not an either-or issue.  The UK will probably accept both.  The US concern is that the EU not have the ability to set production standards to exclude US goods from the UK market.

&gt;Barnier’s question goes to the heart of what Brexit means for the U.K.: trade deals with one set of partners may preclude agreements with others.

A customs union, say, might.  That's an intrinsically exclusive arrangement.

FTAs are not.

The US [has an FTA with Chile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile%E2%80%93United_States_Free_Trade_Agreement).  The EU also [has an FTA with Chile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_free_trade_agreements).

Same thing with Canada.  And Canada, as a NAFTA member, is obliged to extend recognition to production standards of other NAFTA members unless it can show that there is a non-NTB basis for them.

Clearly, the EU can function just fine with an FTA with a country that also accepts US products, and has in the past been willing to do so.  It would no doubt prefer to avoid competition in that market, but that's a different matter.

&gt;“The second you allow chlorine-washed chicken into the U.K., the EU will say we don’t want anything to do with chicken from the U.K.,” said Alan Winters, a professor at Sussex University and the director of the U.K. Trade Policy Observatory.

I would wager against that, given the counterexample of Canada, which is a much less-important trading partner for the EU: if that were a red line for an FTA, the EU would never have signed off on CETA.

The EU might disallow Canada from exporting chlorine-washed chicken to the EU, but to simply having chlorine-washed chicken on Canada?  No.

Realistically though, Germany behaving itself and being Russia a shadow of its former self are really all I think we needed in the region and out of NATO.

Why should we continue to invest in defending in Europe, really? If the EU wants to exist as a viable entity, it has to be able to do so without de facto relying on security guarantees to keep it together.

Especially given the way the political winds are blowing on both sides of the Atlantic, continued assumptions that we can continue the current arrangement seem unwise. Someday, someone in Germany will grow an actual spine and ask us to leave (which most Germans want) instead of just complaining, and others will follow suit. And it will spiral from there. Better to get ahead of the situation in order to manage it a bit.

It’s also not clear that we gain from propping up an entity (by helping it maintain an artificial size that it couldn’t or wouldn’t reach on its own) that otherwise couldn’t exist to the same extent and that competes with us.

You’ll hear people all the time claim that American security guarantees aren’t done for charity, we get something out of it, etc. etc., shrugging off complaints about how the defense burden is split now. Well, I’m willing to prove them half-right, at least: we get little out of it anymore, and it’s unclear why it should continue. Like I said: Germany is defanged and behaving, while Russia is not going to drive to the Atlantic anymore.

However, they are wrong in that idealism plays a much larger role in continuing it now than most outside the US appreciate. Such a setup would never have persisted so long after the end the Cold War had that unique experience not defined the American identity so strongly.

I’m in the minority in a big way in the US on this overall (especially for someone who is left-wing), but I really think that as the idealism drains away, more people will come to the same conclusion.

I mean, I read just yesterday about proposed military exercises with Sweden and Finland. Why? How would this better serve our goals than using those forces in Asia, where our focus needs to be? Sweden and Finland are neutral, non-NATO members that are relatively small in size and almost as far away from the areas of real concern for us as you can get.  And even if they weren’t, both would distance themselves from us the moment it was convenient to do so-and we’d wind up with no short or long-term gain to show for it.

If you assume that cowing Russia in the area is a goal of ours then it makes sense; I don’t assume that, though-I say the EU should sort it out. It supposedly has a collective security guarantee, after all.

We’ve been trying to get Europe to do this itself for over a decade now; the sad reality is that Trump’s empty words prompted more action on that front than anything else to date.

127,"&gt;Whether leaving the EU will make Britain bigger or smaller is the best way to understand the dispute. The Priti Patels and Boris Johnsons of the world insist that departure is enhancement. **The EU was, for them, a fog which shrouded Britain’s glory. They regard power as a finite unit which was once lost but has now been reclaimed. The end of one era will usher in a new epoch of national glory and buccaneering global trade.** Britain, which once was small, will be great again. 

There's factual evidence behind this notion which the author has warped. It's not about power, it's about regaining the ability to go about the world as an independent nation. Forget borders and immigration, through membership of the EU, the UK *cannot* arrange its own trade deals, it cannot be in full control of its own foreign policy. This is written into the treaties of the EU, Article 19 of the Treaty on European Union stating:

&gt;**Member States shall coordinate their action in international organisations and at international conferences. They shall uphold the [European] Union's positions in such forums.** The High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy shall organise this coordination.

&gt;**In international organisations and at international conferences where not all the Member States participate, those which do take part shall uphold the [European] Union's positions.**

&gt;Member States which are also members of the United Nations Security Council will concert and keep the other Member States and the High Representative fully informed. **Member States which are members of the Security Council will, in the execution of their functions, defend the positions and the interests of the [European] Union** without prejudice to their responsibilities under the provisions of the United Nations Charter.

Evidently even at the United Nations Security Council, the UK must ultimately act in the interests of the European Union rather than itself. This isn't conspiracy, it's all readily available to read.


&gt;This echo of President Trump’s fatuous slogan may be unintended but is audible nonetheless.

Oh look, a desperate attempt to link Brexit to Donald Trump so as to semantically disparage the movement.

&gt;The sorry truth is that, even on the threshold of leaving Europe, **Britain has no foreign policy to speak of. It is hard to think of any global dispute in which our view matters**, apart from the fight we have picked with the EU. **British irrelevance is not helped by the fact that we have an unspeakable foreign secretary** who should never have been appointed and now ought to be sacked. Yet it is also more than that. It is a sign of times to come.

The UK is one of only a handful of countries in the world with global power projection capabilities. Where are Germany's aircraft carriers I ask? What about overseas military bases? There are only two countries in Europe that are capable of contributing meaningfully to global security, France does so frequently in North Africa and the UK does so elsewhere, perhaps less gallantly in the Middle East of late but one can point to examples including Britain ending the civil war in Sierra Leone in 2002 after 10 years of failure by UN forces or today how UK forces safeguard Belize against an aggressive Guatemala in Central America. 

The UK doesn't currently have a bespoke foreign policy *because* of its membership of the EU and the coordination of EU foreign policy under the Common Foreign and Security Policy to which the UK is bound. The UK is well-placed however to reforge ties with emerging markets and powers while the EU continues its punitive agricultural embargo against African food producers for example.

As for Boris Johnson, his gaffes are minor compared to actions like David Cameron meeting with the Dali Lama which sparked a short diplomatic freeze with China several years ago. His bumbling that the media spotlights today will be inconsequential in the decades to come when he's inevitably removed from office. The divisions in the cabinet today hardly set the UK on an irreversible path of unilateral decline as the author strangely suggests.

This author is very much tied to the out-of-date, 20th century stereotype of British decline and is desperately attempting to weave it into a tapestry charting a nightmarish future that he actually seems to *want* to transpire. This is another bog-standard hit piece designed to scare readers until slowly but surely enough people change their mind on Brexit. It's marketed towards the patriotic sort who support Brexit and who care about the UK's place in the world. But this is the kind of author who today expresses his fear of Britain losing its geopolitical position and declining further into obscurity, yet who before the referendum denied that Britain occupied any such meaningful role in the first place, lest it spur Brexit or patriotism on. 

In these articles, the authors never acknowledge that all European/western nations are in relative decline, or reveal how even the entire eurozone is predicted to comprised just 10-12% of global GDP by 2060. They omit this because it shows that European integration is futile as a means to remain relevant in the world and reveals just how useless remaining in the EU would be for the UK. What's the point of the UK remaining in the EU in decades to come as the member state with the largest economy and population (as is forecast by the 2030s) if the very structure and ideology of the EU forever prevents the UK from leading the bloc which itself is in relative decline as well? How can that ever be better than being free to chart one's own destiny?

Ultimately the article is very cheap and and merely regurgitates the well-known past instead of making any great points or arguments. It only exists to instill uncertainty and doubt to convert Brexiteers or to further incense remainers.

My problem was that if there's a source of ruthenium, I'd imagine that it isn't fine powder.  So you'd have to have your furnace get hot enough to melt the stuff.  And you have to get ruthenium really hot to melt it, a lot hotter than normal iron and steel furnaces get.

quote from your first post:

&gt; The country is either a sovereign independent state or it isn't.

Ok ... I get it. You are against a united Europe, but in favor of cooperation between countries. 

In that sense, Macron is not your friend. 

I'm pro-European myself. I live in a very small country, were territorial sovereignty is only as real as your neighboring countries respecting it. 

Retreating behind our castle's walls only worked up to the invention of cannons. In both world wars our independence has not been respected. So the European Idea is quite dear to us. We have learned that giving up a little sovereignty in order to sit at the same table were decisions about the shared part of your sovereignty are made, is quite useful. 

Sovereignty is about political power, of which the ultimate expression is war. 

Von Clausewitz quote comes to mind: ""war is merely the continuation of politics by other means""

Giving up a tiny bit of sovereignty and sharing that bit with those partners who otherwise would be your competitors is a good way to preserve peace. Let's not forget that we humans all initially started off as small tribes of families hunting for food together. Those tribes slowly grew in numbers, fought other tribes, formed allegiances, fought other groups who had done the same ... and so on. Each of Europe's countries today is the result of some King or Emperor uniting some people, sometimes by force. 

Aren't we at a point of civilization where we should end that cycle, where we should end wars against other people who have reached the same level of civilization and civility. Haven't we learned anything positive from past wars ? 

The British have voted against giving up a part of their sovereignty. They have a point though: they are sitting on an Island. Their borders are not just drawn on a map. What they didn't think about is, that they want to be in the European single market. Staying in the European market but leaving the EU, means leaving behind the ability to directly act on the decisions concerning the European single market. 

**Sharing a part of your sovereignty means being more dependent on your partners, but also being stronger together.**

219,"&gt;That's great, but why am I paying the full price, then

I don't think that there is a single price.  [It looks like it varies around the world](https://qz.com/996248/this-is-the-cheapest-place-in-the-world-to-get-netflix/).

It looks like it's especially cheap in Mexico and Canada, so might have something to do with tariffs charged Netflix.

&gt;How do they even come up with these restrictions?

Probably because those restrictions are the ones that they can most-favorably get deals from the rights-holders on, I imagine.  If they were freely given worldwide rights, I'd imagine that they'd be using 'em.

&gt;And why does Netflix ban legit IPv6 tunnels with Hurricane Electric

I assume that they use IPs to identify where a consumer is located and only have rights to distribute specific video in specific countries.  Tunnel providers will let people span countries, and given that NAT is sufficient to download video, I'd assume that the reason someone would use a tunnel broker for Netflix would predominantly be to defeat geographical restrictions.  If enough people do that, I assume that they just decide to block 'em.

Also, isn't Hurricane Electric a West Coast company?  Isn't that a lot slower than than an East Coast (or European, if you don't care about a US location) provider?",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/7bvbbi/number_of_tv_shows_available_on_netflix_in_each/dplp22j/,vokegaf,1510280014

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_in_Puritan_New_England

&gt;Christmas celebrations in New England were illegal during parts of the 17th century, and were culturally taboo or rare in former Puritan colonies from foundation until the 1850s. The Puritan community found no Scriptural justification for celebrating Christmas, and associated such celebrations with paganism and idolatry. The earliest years of the Plymouth Colony were troubled with non-Puritans attempting to make merry, and Governor William Bradford was forced to reprimand offenders. English laws suppressing the holiday were enacted in the Interregnum, but repealed late in the 17th century. However, the Puritan view of Christmas and its celebration had gained cultural ascendancy in New England, and Christmas celebrations continued to be discouraged despite being legal. When Christmas became a federal holiday in 1870, the Puritan view was relaxed and late 19th century Americans fashioned the day into the Christmas of commercialism, spirituality, and nostalgia that most Americans recognize today.

-

&gt;Puritans heaped contempt on Christmas, Daniels writes, calling it 'Foolstide' and suppressing any attempts to celebrate it for several reasons. First, no holy days except the Sabbath were sanctioned in Scripture, second, the most egregious behaviors were exercised in its celebration (Cotton Mather railed against these behaviors), and third, December 25 was ahistorical. The Puritan argued that the selection of the date was an early Christian hijacking of a Roman festival, and to celebrate a December Christmas was to defile oneself by paying homage to a pagan custom.[1] James Howard Barnett notes in *The American Christmas* (1984) that the Puritan view prevailed in New England for almost two centuries.[2]",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/7bvy9o/polish_pm_calls_for_an_eu_where_christianity_is/dplqm2b/,vokegaf,1510281821

276,"A moment is coming which will mark the end of an era. The likeliest date for Britain’s departure from the European Union remains, despite the forlorn attempts of those who can neither believe it nor accept it, March 2019, at the end of the allotted Article 50 period. There will then be a transition period, of unspecified content and uncertain duration, which means the point of departure might be a messy process rather than a single moment. Nevertheless, the next five years will bring Britain a significant shift in its status. Now, without wishing to be too gloomy on a delicate subject, is quite likely that this will come soon after or not long before the end of the Elizabethan era. The symbol of postwar British stability may depart at much the same time as her country leaves the EU. There will also, in all probability, be a new prime minister. It is going to be a big moment of national reflection which may be the start of something or merely mark the sense of an ending.

Whether leaving the EU will make Britain bigger or smaller is the best way to understand the dispute. The Priti Patels and Boris Johnsons of the world insist that departure is enhancement. The EU was, for them, a fog which shrouded Britain’s glory. They regard power as a finite unit which was once lost but has now been reclaimed. The end of one era will usher in a new epoch of national glory and buccaneering global trade. Britain, which once was small, will be great again. This echo of President Trump’s fatuous slogan may be unintended but is audible nonetheless.

This fantasy will be the worst legacy of today’s politics. Kurt Andersen has just published Fantasyland: How America Went Haywire which studies the blurred lines between reality and illusion in Trump’s America. A line from Demosthenes that Andersen uses as an epigraph — “the easiest thing of all is to deceive oneself; for we believe whatever we want to believe” — applies exactly to those leavers still in the cabinet, those recently departed and those on the back benches.

The sorry truth is that, even on the threshold of leaving Europe, Britain has no foreign policy to speak of. It is hard to think of any global dispute in which our view matters, apart from the fight we have picked with the EU. British irrelevance is not helped by the fact that we have an unspeakable foreign secretary who should never have been appointed and now ought to be sacked. Yet it is also more than that. It is a sign of times to come.

There is a political adage that a nation on the way down either manages to decline or declines to manage. The sense that Britain was waning in the postwar years spawned a literature in which Britain’s decline was specified and in which reasons for it were adduced. In economic terms, Britain, the foremost economic power in Europe in 1950, found its GDP superseded by that of both France and Germany. Britain’s lead in productivity per head had also been drastically reversed by the end of the 1970s. In diplomatic terms it was Suez in 1956 which ended the era in which Britain was the major power in the Middle East. The politics of decline came to a head in Heath’s defeat by the miners in 1974 and the disastrous industrial relations of the winter of 1978/9. Before the shock treatment of Thatcherism, Britain was declining to manage because it was reluctant to manage its decline.

t will not be long before this debate starts again because leaving the EU is going to shrink Britain a little. This will be a slow and gradual descent rather than a singular cataclysm, like the crash of 2008. Capital will creep away rather than fly. After a dip, the economy will grow slowly rather than vigorously. Investment levels will remain stubbornly low as returns are better elsewhere. The City of London will contract as Britain, the worst performer in an old continent during the Asian century, begins to look less attractive to mobile labour. The policies needed to reform a labour market that cannot use immigration to cover up its deficiencies are beyond the political class which is of the lowest calibre in living memory. In these circumstances, Britain’s struggle to find the money to fund its defence budget will begin to look quaint in a country that matters less. Long after the departure of a defence secretary who is less famous than his own spider, the once important office of state will be diminished. President Trump will eventually be defeated in the battle he is waging with the American constitution. His successor will whisper sweet nothings about the special relationship with Britain but that is all they will be. With no route into the diplomatic chambers of Europe, London will be of less value to Washington. When the inevitable reform of the security council and other high committees of the United Nations comes, Britain will look around in vain for friends who share its inflated view of its own importance. In retrospect the Thatcher and Blair years will look like an interregnum between two eras of decline. The choice the nation has made, unbeknown to the most enthusiastic choosers, is to retreat into the second or third tier of nations. There is no shame in such a choice. This is a small nation and we could potter along happily not really bothering anyone. We could give up on all that diplomatic engagement, value-exporting and exercise of cultural power. We could opt for the quiet life that, ever since the demise of the imperial dream when a quarter of the world’s population was under our command, we have been resisting. At Potsdam, Churchill dealt on equal terms with Stalin and Truman and not a Frenchman or a German in sight. The Brexit boys and girls deep in their national hearts, think we are heading back to those glory days.

The sober truth is that the long 20th century will come to an end at the conclusion of the Elizabethan era. Europe, a subject measured not in the profit and loss ledger but in emotional spasms, will have diminished the nation and all in the name of national glory. We will all survive the shrinkage. It is not the end of Britain, let alone the end of the world, although the end of Britain is of course an outcome that might greet the end of the Elizabethan era. By then we will have forgotten the fantastic promises of the Patels and Johnsons as it becomes clear that Britain has lost the EU but failed to find another role.

288,"For all you know, Macron might be going to Saudi Arabia to prevent a war in Lebanon. This visit is a surprise visit, so it's related to urgent matters. 

For some background: the Lebanese PM, Saad Hariri (who also holds Saudi citizenship and is pretty rich) announced, while in Saudi Arabia, his resignation. This sent the Lebanese government into crisis, of course. They just had 2 years without a president and last year were finally able to form a unity government with parties across the political and ethnosectarian spectrum.

Hezbollah is part of this coalition. Saudi Arabia has said that Lebanon declared war on it. This is not true, Lebanon did no such thing. But days ago Yemeni Houthi rebels fired a ballistic missile at the Saudi capital, and Saudis would use that as reason, because both Hezbollah and the Houthis are Iranian supported.

It's worth noting that the party of PM (or ex-PM) Hariri is demanding Hariri come back to Lebanon; which means they are not on board with Hariri’s resignation and disappearance to Saudia. 

So what happens after Saudia Arabia declares that Lebanon declared war on it? Will they actually attack it? They don't really have opportune resources to do it, unless perhaps if they would go through Israel. Despire Saudi-Israeli under-the-table cooperation, this seems a huge, huge stretch. But a lot of muscle is being flexed, with several gulf states ordering their citizens to leave Lebanon or even actually evacuating them like Kuwait has.

Lebanon is an ex-colony of France and France still has ties to the country. I think a surprise visit of Macron to Saudi Arabia is in the first place connected to this crisis.

* We need to rekindle a desire for Europe — a shared undertaking for peace, reconciliation and development. We need to build this new European venture around sovereignty, a taste for the future, and democracy.

* The results of these consultations would enable European governments to prepare a concise roadmap, with a small number of shared challenges and specific actions, tracing out priorities for the union’s action ...


**sovereignty** got me 13 matches, only a few though are actually in the article itself: 

*  We need to build this new European venture around sovereignty, a taste for the future, and democracy.

* I say that those who truly believe in sovereignty are pro-Europeans: Europe is our chance to recover full sovereignty. Sovereignty means a population freely exercising its collective choices on its territory. And having sovereignty means being able to act effectively.

* Even beyond financial contributions, it is imperative that the United Kingdom accepts joint responsibility, along with the European Union, for managing the problem of refugees at the union’s borders.

Europe is the proper level of sovereignty protection for these matters. 

*my conclusion*

Basically Macron is saying that there are challenges we should face together at a European level (refugee crisis, trade agreements ...), but overall sovereignty should be at a national level. In both cases legitimized by a democratic process. 

&gt; Sovereignty means a population freely exercising its collective choices on its territory. And having sovereignty means being able to act effectively.

340,"Very interesting. Well, again, culture and historical monuments are no guarantee of a good place to live, nor are 19th century scientists, or again, India would be an awesome country to live in. And I imagine Senegal and Ghana would enjoy a pretty high quality of life if the success of their PL footballers translated to wealth. Yeah, we do have some great universities, Edinburgh in particular is among the best in Europe. But unfortunately universities can't power a whole economy. 

The problem with Scotland is we have massive and entrenched class inequality. It doesn't register in the statistics because we don't have the massive billionaires that skew the stats in England and the US and such like, but the reality is we are one of the most socioeconomically unequal countries in the developed world. 

Parts of Scotland are idyllic, pretty, touristy areas like the centre of Edinburgh, St Andrews, the Highlands and the West End of Glasgow. But the rest, the places the tourists never see, and where the vast majority of Scots live, can be truly soul-destroying. It's the same problem as the rust belt in the USA: we were once one of the industrial capitals of the world, our big strength being skilled manufacturing: at one point in the 19th century, 1 in 4 ships on all the worlds oceans were made in Scotland. But the industries died out after WW2, and especially in the 1980s under Margaret Thatcher, the British Prime Minister, who shifted the UK from a manufacturing economy to a service economy. 

Whole towns lost their raison d'etre: every town and village more or less was centred around some small factory, like my tiny village was famous around the world for its furniture manufacturing (ever heard the expression 'like rearranging the deckchairs on the Titanic? We literally made those deckchairs, lol). And then, the jobs just vanished. 

By the way, just to give you a picture of what big cities like Glasgow and Dundee were like at the time, they were like San Fransisco of today, in the sense that people flocked to them from hundreds of miles around, and property became so expensive a lot of people just lived on the streets. Not for long though, as the 19th century shipping magnates that the perfect solution: thousands and thousands of units of high-density flats right outside the shipping yards. 

Great idea, right? Well, the poorly educated Irish and Highland immigrants were grateful at first to have a job which put food on the table and a roof over their head. But they soon realised the builders had cut corners. And this is the Victorian period, so I don't mean there were a few leaks. I mean they had effectively built massive, cholera-infested slums. The slums were terrible places to live, so the men didn't bother coming home after work, they just drank themselves stupid at the pub with their friends. The children formed gangs and fought each other with razorblades just for fun as they had nothing better to do, at least until they were put to work aged 10 or 12. 

These slums, with no indoor plumbing, 8 people to a tiny room, little heating, pretty much carried on until WW2, and even after that in some areas, the last one was only cleared in the 1970s. But after the war, they had the bright idea of moving people from these areas, which were at least central, out to massive new housing estates on the edges of the cities. The housing estates had no services, no community buildings, no real shopping areas, and to begin with no transport connections either.

What do you get when you take a load of rough, poorly educated shipbuilders, already with a drink problem, and a load of kids who grew up packed together in a slum plagued by alcoholism and gangs of marauding 10 year olds (oh, and I forgot to mention Sectarian violence between Irish Catholics and Scottish Protestants who were competing for jobs and space), take away their jobs, dump them in the middle of nowhere with zero life prospects? 

The answer: an underclass with near 100% unemployment, where the only entertainment was gang warfare, alcohol, and increasingly as you got into the 80s and 90s, drugs. Scotland has an opiate crisis nearly as bad as that of the USA, the only saving grace being we don't have such a predatory medical industry or it would probably be MUCH worse than the USA. We were for a time the most violent country in the developed world, with a murder rate comparable to that of Cape Town or Moscow. To this day, there are neighborhoods where about 30% of all males over 40 have giant knife scars across their faces due to gang fighting. 

Our economy never quite recovered from Thatcherism, and although it's got significantly better in the last 10 years with greatly reduced crime and social welfare projects, we still have whole areas which suffer from the same kind of problems you see in black areas of Detroit and Chicago: nobody there has any real prospects, they are far away from any sources of jobs, schools are so rough that no decent teacher wants to work there so education is terrible, plus we have a local dialect which is so different from standard English some kids that go into a job interview literally can't make themselves understood if the interviewer is English or from a different part of the country. 

Plus, and this is just my personal opinion, but Scotland has utterly abysmal architecture. It's all grey, squat, designed to conserve heat . The kind of thing that makes for a picturesque castle, but probably  should have been retired at the end of the Medieval period, and not just updated with modern materials:

https://i0.wp.com/www.glasgowarchitecture.co.uk/images/jpgs/cumbernauld_town_centre_d280411_d1.jpg

Then add in the rainy and dull weather, the poor diet, the lack of exercise from the unemployment, and then the aforementioned lack of education and alcoholism, and you get perhaps the worst health in the developed world: parts of Glasgow have a lower life expectancy than Baghdad due to rates of heart disease and obesity as well as smoke and alcohol-related cancers. We already had a national mood that tended towards pessimism and bottling up our emotions, so it's not surprising that all of the above translates to awful mental health, hence the suicide. So yeah, Scotland is recovering from its malaise slowly, but it really was a terrible place to live for many people throughout the 20th century.",,/r/europe/comments/7brp9w/europes_gloomiest_cities/dpljdhm/,CopperknickersII,1510272796

Not necessarily.

With time passing and events occurring, people reflected, and enthusiasm and practical support for such a coalition died down.

I would see it the other way. If you lump all the parties together it can make voters feel like they've no choice, and then go to ideologically similar unionist parties.

ERC showing that they're preserving their own policy could be a good sign to voters. 

&gt; Of course they can, but the point is that polls show that independentists are getting less seats than they had, and if independence were really the absolutely most important issue Catalans are facing, politicians should fight for it and do whatever necessary to assure as many seats as possible.

Again, a coalition is not a guaranteed method of increasing seat count. ",,/r/europe/comments/7bugwe/catalan_separatists_to_contest_election_separately/dpljdra/,Gasinomation,1510272806

I'm always flabbergasted how you Germans find completely made up excuses like this to defend your policies.

From 1995 to 2015 Germany's population went from 82 million to 81 million. That's a decrease, not an increase.

Meanwhile UK went from 57 million to 65 million, or an increase of 8 million.

Germany went from 1136 CO2e to 927 Mt CO2e, or a reduction of 18%
UK went from 766 CO2e to 537 Mt CO2e, or a reduction of 30%, or 12 points more than Germany, despite the population increase.

Neither of those. Gendered job titles (""businessman/businesswoman"" and the like) aside, the only way to determine the gender of ""the person doing the thing"" in Finnish is from context. It's quite similar to English if you replace ""he"" and ""she"" with the singular ""they"".

For example, you could say something like ""Hanna, tuo kauhea kannibaali, istuu veneessä. Hän syö Matin jalkaa."" The same in English: ""Hanna, that terrible cannibal, sits in a boat.

540,"""Relations politiques
La France bénéficie traditionnellement en Roumanie d’un capital de sympathie important, qui trouve son origine dans le soutien de Napoléon III à la création de l’Etat roumain, puis à une fraternité d’armes durable née pendant la Première Guerre mondiale. Le dialogue politique bilatéral s’est approfondi après 1989, à la lumière du soutien français à la double candidature de Bucarest à l’Union européenne et à l’OTAN, et a débouché en février 2008 sur la signature d’un accord de partenariat stratégique.

Relations économiques
Les investisseurs français, implantés de façon durable et souvent pionnière en Roumanie, représentent une communauté d’affaires dynamique d’environ 2.280 entreprises (dont 36 du CAC 40, mais aussi une majorité de PME), qui emploient environ 89.000 salariés et contribuent à près de 15% du PIB roumain. 

Coopération culturelle, scientifique et technique
Les liens culturels entre la France et la Roumanie sont étroits et anciens. Le français s’est diffusé dès le XVIIIe siècle au sein des élites roumaines, et la France a depuis accueilli de nombreux intellectuels et artistes roumains, en particulier au XXe siècle (Cioran, Brancusi, Eliade, Ionesco, Anna de Noailles, Enesco, etc).
La Roumanie, dont près d’un quart de la population parle français, est membre depuis 1993 de l’Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie, dont elle a accueilli le 11e sommet en septembre 2006. ""

Of the 40% unemployed, a portion of them works either for just cash or it's just on and off work that's also just for money, so the healthcare fond doesn't get filled. So we have underplayed medical staff, from physicians to nurses and medical technicians. Add to that the 50+ patients per day, so not everybody get's more than like 5 minutes of doctor-patient time. The doctors are stressed. We suffer from first world illnesses, obesity, smoking etc.

&gt; This is the root of this discussion, I was answering this question, nothing about any ownership because again, I have never claimed anything about it.

No, it's not. The root of this discussion is me saying that Sarmatism has white pride attached to it because of Sarmatism.

You on the other hand focused on whether or not Sarmatism as a whole has merit. **I dare you to find a credible source claiming so.** 

&gt; I answered yes to that question, that it's obvious, and then you answered how it doesn't work like that (ancestry) 

Okay, fine - it's obvious. Provide sources, please. And, no ancestry does not work like that.

&gt; and then just changed the topic to something complexity else, some bizarre right to a piece of land.

Why do you think nationalists cling to ""Greater"" concepts? It's about territory. Latching on to glory of ancient empires etc. I didn't change topics because it's still about nationalists. 

&gt; Fad implies that something was short lived, was this short lived?

Who cares if it was short lived or not?

&gt; Silly is your judgement being in the year 2017, 

What?

&gt; easy enough for you to say, and yeah it has merit, 

Okay, please give sources.

&gt; because again, they do share ancestry, that's all I claimed to know for sure rest is speculation I don't really care about.

Fucking finally. Yes, they do **share ancestry**. Namely proto-into-european. And yes, everything you say is speculation. That's what I said from the start.

&gt; No, humans are not inbred, to be inbred there has to be inbreeding, sharing some common ancestor doesn't mean we are inbred, just like dogs aren't, the health issue might be a result of inbreeding but they aren't inbred unless they actually are, unless there is intentional inbreeding going on, like certain dogs I'm sure or Monarchs in the past.

I just use your logic against you. I'm glad to see you argueing against it because conflating everything is retarded and I hope you see why. 

&gt; You can have issues caused by inbreeding but not be inbred, to be inbred you have to be a direct result of inbreeding

???



I think we have a language barrier problem. At the end of the day it's fun to speculate, but if you cannot provide sources that Sarmatism has merit then we have nothing else to talk about.

620,"&gt;what is the difference between a crime that doesn't justify murdering or enslaving or whatever you want to do, and a one that does.

Really? One is justified, one isn't. It's okay to do one, but not the other. The only difference between those is towards whom you are inflicting the harm. If the person deserve it, you are justified in the action. If not, you are unjustified, and therefore if the same action happened to you, then you do not suffer injustice, your feelings do no matter. That's it.

&gt;but who is so bad that they should get murdered and who isn't

The one who murders unjustifiably is the one who is bad enough to deserve murder. This I consider concrete.

What is not as concrete to me ethically, as murder against rapists for example. Murdering rapists may be beneficial society, but the act of murder can be (but sometimes not depending on victims' reaction, eg some commit suicide) worse than the act of rape, therefore murdering a rapist may be unethical. Personally, I would rather a society simply rid itself of rapists as not much is lost anyway, genetically and culturally.

&gt;Example I think that if someone commits a crime where that results in a victim, they should get murdered, something like that is what you should believe in since you have such strong opinions about the topic, so just tell me what actually is it.

It depends on the severity of the crime.

Either way, my ultimate point is that rehabilitation is vile because it spits on victims' feelings and it allows for worthless people to continue propagating their harmful values and genes onto society. Their (presumably justified) murder or slavery is more ethical, that is all. ",,/r/europe/comments/7btnn5/the_eus_highest_incarceration_rates_infographic/dpkyfgt/,rumelo,1510250736

&gt;France’s high statutory tax rate is coupled with low revenues, measured either as a share of GDP or total tax revenues (Figure 1.7) because of the large number of loopholes and tax breaks. As the Conseil des Prélèvements Obligatoires (French Tax and Social Charges Board,2009) points out, the result is an effective tax rate paid on realised profits of only **8% for companies included in the CAC40** (the main index of the Paris stock exchange) and 22% for SMEs. **More generally, the report finds that the effective tax rate diminishes as company size increases**. The three major tax expenditures include: i) the tax consolidation regime, whereby the profits and losses of individual companies belonging to the same group may be consolidated (CPO, 2010), ii) the deductibility of interest payments on debt financing, and iii) the tax credit on investment in research and development. The way global corporations consolidate their profits depends on tax rates in other countries, so having a high nominal tax rate naturally encourages businesses to pay taxes elsewhere. If interest income is taxed at the household level, interest deductibility can be justified to avoid double taxation. The government’s decision to cap the deductibility of interest payments on borrowing goes in the direction of double taxation but at the same time will reduce the differential cost of debt and equity financing](http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/docserver/download/1013061e.pdf?expires=1510244788&amp;id=id&amp;accname=ocid53016276&amp;checksum=2D5770936DAFD92E827084883AB7A7EB)

863,"strict of Viseu already only has water for another 25 days. If it does not rain in the near future, the mayor assures that supplies to the population could be jeopardized due to the low capacity of the region's reservoirs.


""The situation is worrying. In the next 10 days, it is not expected to rain, ""begins Almeida Henriques in the Renaissance, this Thursday.


""Our Fagilde reservoir is currently with 360 thousand cubic meters of water, we are consuming an average of 17 thousand cubic meters per day, which means that we have water for 20/25 days, which is very short compared to the forecast which lies ahead, ""he says.


According to the mayor of Viseu, measures have been taken since June, particularly with regard to public awareness, but more needs to be done.


""There is a clear lowering of consumption on the part of the populations, which means that the appeals are being followed, but there needs to be a greater saving of water by the people,"" he says.


Therefore, with the municipalities of Nelas, Mangualde and Penalva, Viseu is using other measures, such as the reuse of quarrying water and the use of portable water treatment plants (etares).


Almeida Henriques also speaks of the need to implement water transportation by train, because the resources made available by road are depleting the existing capacity.


""At this moment, only in Viseu we are talking about about 112 loads per day made by tanker trucks - an extremely expensive operation. Mangualde is already doing so, Penalva do Castelo is also already doing three or four loads per day, but there is a moment when it becomes practically impossible to supply 130 to 140 thousand people through a system based only on the highway "", explains .


In progress, therefore, is the drafting of a water transportation plan by train. ""This possibility has been studied, the Government has been in permanent contact with us, in order to also make a nocturnal transport by rail"", confirms Almeida Henriques.


""Anyway, we are talking about a transport of 500 cubic meters of water, we are not talking about a miracle solution, even because there are no miracles in this situation"", stresses in the Morning of the Renaissance.


These are difficulties that increase with the financial problems involved in these alternatives, used for the water supply. Almeida Henriques speaks of a huge effort that the local authorities are not holding: in only 10 days, only the Chamber spent 200 thousand euros - that is ""an average consumption of means of 20 thousand euros per day"".


Therefore, says the mayor, it is necessary that the Government makes other financial aid available.


""The Government has already made available a carbon fund line of 250 thousand euros, but it is necessary to look at this situation. This is clearly an emergency situation in the country, ""he added, adding that"" only the Câmara de Viseu has already exhausted the budget that the Government has made available and has not yet signed the protocol. ""


For next week, a new meeting is scheduled with the Ministry of the Environment, where new contingency measures may be taken to cope with the drought, considering that rain is not expected in the coming days.


Water levels in Portuguese dams are worrying. Two EDP hydro plants are halted by drought and four more are under ""prudent management,"" according to the economic newspaper ""Eco.""


In addition, EDP was forced to condition production in Guilhofrei, Carrapatelo, Aguieira / Raiva and Belver, the same source adds.",Portugal,/r/europe/comments/7bthuc/portuguese_government_considers_delivering_water/dpkl8t3/,SANDEMAN,1510236511
864,"Well it is a FINAL thing. Once you it's done you can't take it back.

Now, in most cases, this is fine. Because the people have no chance of ever getting better. They will die one way or another, we can just make it easier for them. No moral issue there.

But it gets muddier when it comes to treatable diseases. Or diseases that have good potential for a cure.

For example, recently they performed first full skin graft with genetically modified stem cells on a child refugee from Syria.

Until it was done there was no hope for people with his condition. Their skin would simply fall off and they would die in incredible pain. Only thing that could help was a morphine pump.

Now suppose you have someone like this asking for euthanasia. A year back or so. You know that they have good chance of survival in  near future, and all they need to do is hold on for a year or so. 

Are you going to help them die? Or do you give them chance of survival? 

Giving them what they want is moral, because it is their life. But if they lasted a year longer, they could survive and live normal life. And that would also be good and probably beneficial.


The things get even worse when you account for mental state of the people. Let's say you have person with advanced alzheimer asking for euthanasia. Ok, their life, their choice.

But what if that same person has a lot of money and eager heirs? 
Could it be that the granny is just saying what they told her to?
I have seen families, almost literally, kill their elders for money before. Using neglect and abuse. They made these people wish for death. And considerably shortened their life.

Now, would you do it? Would you give death to that person?

And what about person with Down Syndrome? No chance of improvement, ever. There is no cure. They will never have children, normal jobs, normal life. They will always, with very few exceptions, be dependent on others.

If that persons asks you for the release, will you oblige?
And if so, are you sure they are aware of the implications?


And what about Autistic person? Again, no chance of recovery. No chance of being ""normal"". Will you do what they want? And do they know what it mean? Isn't it just their parents, trying to get rid of a burden?


And finally suppose you have person suffering from depression.
Are they truly in a state where they can rationally weight the pros and cons? Is it possible to measure that? Should you give them what they want? Even if they themselves might not want it in the future?

Especially if you have other hereditary precursor diseases like Ulcerative Colitis or Crohns disease. This can go as far as having different recommendations for different ethnicities - Ashkenazi Jews for an example have a higher risk of colorectal cancer and just by being an Ashkenazi Jew a doctor might recommend you to have a colonoscopy when you reach your 50th birthday or something like that.

&gt;In the case of Catalonia acceding to independence, 49.1% of Spanish consumers, not counting the Catalans, would stop buying products from that community

23% of Spanish consumers, not including Catalonia, have stopped buying Catalan products and another 21% intend to do so in the future, according to the report 'The impact of the independence challenge on the reputation of Catalan companies', prepared by Reputation Institute.
In the case of Catalonia acceding to independence, 49.1% of Spanish consumers, not counting the Catalans, would stop buying products from that autonomous community, which would result in a loss of 20,000 million euros for the Catalan companies, has explained today the general director of Reputation Institute for Spain and Latin America, Enrique Johnson.

Why the boycott of Catalan products is a mistake
Of the remaining 50.9%, 15.4% are not clear about their decision and 35.5% are reluctant to stop buying Catalan products even in the case of independence. In any case, only 24% of Spaniards are able to correctly identify the companies linked to Catalonia.
41.5% have a low capacity to associate companies with their origin and 34.1% have an average capacity. This factor is positive for Catalan companies, according to Johnson, although reputational risk is high.
Regarding the transfer of the headquarters of Catalan companies to the rest of Spain, which is taking place since the referendum on October 1, 77.5% of Spaniards (not including Catalonia) is totally in agreement with this measure, to 10.9% that disagrees and to 11.6% that remains neutral.
Transfer of venues
Companies that have moved their headquarters out of Catalonia manage to maintain their reputation in the rest of Spain and increase their attractiveness as an investment, with 3.2 more reputation points. On the contrary, the firms that have maintained their headquarters in Catalonia see the confidence of the rest of Spain in 3.4 points and the purchase intention in 3.2 points, when their reputation falls.
From the Catalan point of view, there is a polarization over companies that have changed their headquarters: 47.8% strongly disagree with this movement and 38.3% strongly agree, while 13.9% it remains neutral.
The companies that have moved their headquarters suffer a negative impact of reputation among Catalans, 8.7 points less, so it decreases the confidence in them by 9.6 points and the intention of buying in nine other points.
The data collection for this analysis was made from October 24 to 30, with a total of 41 selected companies, 1,150 respondents and a total of 4,100 evaluations.

Those parliaments have representatives voted in by all citizens of those countries, so, indirectly, a majority of Canadians and UK citizens agreed to those referendums.

1083,"&gt; I know it is not that simple, but we should think about why a company has the same rights as an individual.

I'm still not convinced that that is the actual problem. The problem is that most of the time, tax evasion consists of entirely reasonable actions individually, but that then add up to something unreasonable.

I.e. It is reasonable for a company to be able to have their base in country A. It is reasonable for said company to buy services from a company in country B. It is reasonable for said company to have an associate company in country B. It is reasonable for the company in country B to be taxed by country B. It is reasonable for the company in country A to sometimes buy things from their company in country B. It is _not_ reasonable when they do this to avoid taxes.

1087,"&gt; It’s not like we don’t have a working solution already available.

Could you kindly explain which one?

&gt; Stop pretending that this is a new issue.

Nobody is pretending that. In fact, measures to fight tax evasion and tax avoidance have been implemented, even in most of those offshore countries. (Of course it's still ridiculously easy to anonymously register a corporation -- you could even register one in Delaware without having a physical address and pay for it with one of those debit cards you can buy at gas stations. Getting a proper bank account for it is another matter, though.) 

The problem is that, in the end, countries still set their own notoriously complex tax policies. So, loop holes occur, especially when you design cross-country structures, and they can be exploited until they've been fixed. On top of that, national tax auditors usually don't have the necessary capacity/competence to properly investigate those complex structures that armies of specialized lawyers come up with, at least not to the degree that would be necessary to effectively end those practices entirely.

Reforming tax systems to reduce complexity and close loopholes is a difficult process. Those complexities emerge because often exceptions are necessary for legitimate reasons, and you can't just take them away without impacting the people or businesses that they were intended to protect.  
Of course there are some that could (and should) be changed, but then you often run into another issue -- countries are reluctant to give up a policy that they benefit from, and that it would be for the greater good of all tends not to be enough to convince them.",European Federation | Germany,/r/europe/comments/7brozb/britain_tries_to_water_down_eu_antitax_haven/dpkebis/,CountVonTroll,1510222405

You have people advocating sending ships/aircraft to Asia to reinforce defence commitments with OZ/NZ and take on new ones with Japan etc.

When she learned I am Swedish she became very emotional and exclaimed that I was a hero and my country is the reason she and her entire family survived. She then told me about taking a boat in the middle of the night to reach the safety of Sweden. She demanded I hug her. I was so embarrassed by being called a hero for something I had nothing to do with but it was awesome to share a moment with another woman from a totally different world than the one I live in. I was proud to be a Swedish girl that day, very proud.

Burden of proof is on you to show Luther cared because it was germany and not because he was against the concepts. You can make inane arguments all you want but you need to show with sources that he didnt care about these things outside of Germany. 

My impression is that you deny the historical conext because you took a  position and cant admit you are wrong. 

I think the issue here is you may be not understanding what my point is. 

I think you are trying to state that Luther was influenced by his surroundings and environments which happen to be Germany. I dont disagree with this, BUT that applies to anyone. Any person in any location is going to respond to events occurring around them. 

The issue is we are discussing a German national identity. Luther's motivations had nothing to do with this. Luther was not taking his actions because he wanted to help only Germans out or out of German nationalism. Rather he felt the catholic church was corrupt and was a barrier between man and god, and had no real divine authority. He felt it was keeping people away from salvation and wanted to help all people. 

You can believe in Luther if you want. I dont think that makes you a German nationalist but you need to understand Luther didnt do what he did out of any type of German identity. Luther wanted to help Christains who didnt speak German too.

After the formation of Czechoslovakia, the party preserved its conservative character, opposing ethnic Czechoslovakism and demanding Slovak autonomy.

After the county elections in 1923, the party became the biggest party in Slovakia, receiving 34.4% of the vote in the 1925 elections. In 1923, the HSĽS founded the paramilitary Rodobrana organization to protect their meetings. Rodobrana was influenced and manipulated by Vojtech Tuka for his own anti-Czechoslovak intentions[10] and later it was banned by Czechoslovak government.

1427,"&gt;In the last census, you could not state Bosnian as your ethnicity. You had to either be a Bosniak, a Serb, a Croat or... wait for it ... The Rest!


&gt;So, let me say this one more time, you were born in Bosnia, but your country Bosnia does not let you say you are Bosnian. This would be equivalent if people in Britain (which is also a geographical term just like some say Bosnia is) were not allowed to state they were British. How many people there would belong to The Rest?


All Bosniaks, Croats and Serbs in Bosnia are Bosnian. Not all Bosnians are Bosniaks, Croats or Serbs. Bosnian is a nationality and the other three are ethnicities. Just like all Englishmen are Brits, but not all Brits are Englishmen.

&gt;Around a third of Bosnians (and half of the land allegedly too) think they are Serbian

Correction: Around a third of Bosnians are Serbs. Kind of like how a part of the British population is Scottish.


&gt;The remaining two thirds would rather suffer through 3 years of starvation, ethnic cleansing, sieges, bombings, brutal killings, torture and rape than be Serbian

Two-thirds? You know Croats and Bosniaks fought eachother as well, right? A few thousand Serbs died as well. The war was about territory and not about 66% of the population ""being"" Serbs... interesting comment nonetheless.

&gt;Some say that Bosnians had a medieval state but that is not true. Only Serbia's medieval state is valid, as that was written by God himself, his angels and the most objective human being in the known universe Dr. Voja Seselj

Most of what Vojislav Seselj says gets memed by most Serbs. 

&gt;Dr Voja Seselj is also a Bosnian. So are the Serbian-: president Vucic, the late former prime-minister Dzindzic and the one-time leader of the opposition Draskovic. Hm. I think I understand why Serbians want to annex Bosnian territory so much - their politicians are sick of life in diaspora!

Idk what to make of this. Draskovic and Vucic were both born in Serbia, the rest in Bosnia.


&gt;The flag was chosen by the international community because Serbs and Croats did not want a flag that refers to Bosnia as a state or to Bosnian history, heritage, culture, ethnicity or people in any way. The flag is made up of completely random symbols and colours

Idk about the legitimacy of the comment, but I find it quite logical that Serbs and Croats wouldn't want the Bosniak majority to have unfair representation.

It might be true but it wasn't enough, apparently :) Although back then I didn't speak a word of italian and later I started learning so I might be biased. 

My easiest time communicating with an italian I have with a friend from Lombardia. It also makes it easier that he doesn't use the passato remoto so much, which is very irregular, so the grammar is simpler and easier to understand for a foreigner. But it might also help that after three years of meeting italians here in Frankfurt I have ended up more or less learning the language. Heck, I'd say my italian is about as good as my german at this point. At least enough to have a not too horrible conversation after some beers.

1684,"Firstly, I think your use of the word ""dictatorship"" devalues the word for people who actually live in a dictatorship.

Catalonia has plenty of democratic tools, like with a 2/3 majority they can change their own statute. Catalonia had several referendums in 2009, 2011, 2014. Only 37% of people voted in the 2014 one so clearly it wasn't important to most people. You can hold a referendum every other year, but I'm not sure why you expect people to pay attention to them with such a low turnout.

The Statute of Catalonia tells you exactly how to get the issue on the agenda of the national government, but yes, it's needs a 2/3 majority.

&gt;  A democracy without conversation where the majority just tells the minority to do whatever they decide might as well just be a dictatorschip.

So a country that tells gays they can't marry is a dictatorship? Isn't that a little dramatic?

The irony is that if Spain was an actual dictatorship then Rajoy could give Catalonia independence at the stroke of a pen. It's because Spain is a democracy that not even Rajoy can give Catalonia what they want. Do you really think that if tomorrow Rajoy said, ""ok, I'll introduce a constitutional change tomorrow"" that it even has the slightest chance of passing?",The Netherlands,/r/europe/comments/7b3oxs/washington_post_let_catalonia_have_a_free/dpjmoy4/,silent_cat,1510179366

I'm old enough to remember the 1994 Florida refugee crisis (I lived in FL at that time). Basically, the entire damned US coast-guard was completely overwhelmed at sea by 44,000 cuban refugees. 

I have no idea what makes anybody think that 1,100,000 refugees (UNHCR's 2015 estimate) crossing a body of water much trickier to patrol than the Florida straits, is somehow going to be contained by a paper italian navy, a cardboard greek navy, and a non-existent czech navy.

This is all personal anecdotes, so yeah, grain of salt is required.  
I'm from Belgrade,I go to college and study Russian (ironic,isn't it?) so naturally you would expect more people being pro-Russian, right? Well...not really, the majority of the people that i've talked to is either not sure or wants to join the EU, the not sure part being about: 
'We will never get accepted' mentality, not really about the EU as an organization by itself. There is maybe 4 persons i know that are pro-Russian openly, and shocker, saw two of them with Dveri paraphernalia.   
As for the current state of things? People wan't to live better, they realize that through the EU they will get a chance to travel, to actually progress somewhere, to fix the shit that's plaguing our country since the damn 1990s. Of course there's a few individuals, who would like closer ties to Russia, but that's mostly uneducated youth, i've rarely seen anyone that goes to college or higher schooling, that thinks economic cooperation with Russia is a viable alternative to EU. I do not think making open accusations of Serbians being Russian puppets will  make anything better, sure, there is a minority of people that do favor Russia, but that's the minority, i don't seriously think Serbia would 'sell it's Veto vote' to Russia, and that was stated in this thread. Nor do i think Serbia would be a Trojan Horse, i understand our politicians desire to stay in okayish terms with Russia, they have been an ally for most of our history, and Serbs do not forget that, but would we work for their interests? Hell, we can't even work for *our* interests.   

The resolution to these things should be thought of carefully, the EU needs to show more will ( i don't mean bribe, i mean show actually more will) so the Serbians that are undecided see that the EU is serious about Serbia being a member in the future, after all, the EU approval rate was **71%** before the shitshow with Kosovo. 
As for the Kosovo issue, the EU shouldn't make ultimatums, but be flexible, and actually enforce *both* sides to implement what was signed.  
As for NATO, i'm sorry but that won't work out, Serbia indeed does hold exercises with NATO, is a signatory of many cooperation deals and pacts, but i do not see us becoming a member in the forseeable future, there's just too much pain that NATO caused (regardless of which side of the argument you stand on).",Serbia,/r/europe/comments/7bmdcz/juncker_thinks_serbia_could_join_eu_before_2025/dpj8irt/,Helskrim,1510164995

Yes, they won it once in 25 years. If they win it again i will say that they are a nation with sporting history, and if they keep winning, but now it's just an anomaly, not consistent top-tier play.

Egh, the Olympics are just one competition, look at Serbian club football (Red Star was the champion of the world and europe), U-21 i think world champion, Basketball both world champion and european champion multiple times, Serbia is also the only nation to hold gold in every waterpolo championship at the same time, Serbia is also top tier in Volleyball and handball (tho Croatia is better at handball for example), that's not even mentioning female teams, so might be ahead in Olympics (Serbia was banned in 1992, which was a top tier decade for Serbian sports, who knows what would've happend if we participated then) ",Serbia,/r/europe/comments/7b7i4k/what_do_you_know_about_bosnia_and_herzegovina/dpj0ant/,Helskrim,1510156951

Also Dutch sounds are more to the front of the mouth, lots of words that end with the tongue touching the back of your front teeth. Slavic languages have the ""sh"" that forms halfway to the back of your mouth, the soft g sounds that you form towards the back of the tongue, etc.

* Since Catalonia is divisible, there is no point in having all Catalonia secede, and then parts of Catalonia secede back when they declare their referendums...

* So in conclusion, the referendum will actually be a lot of regerendums, one per ""region"" (to be defined) and the regions that say ""YES"" in the referendum will secede, and the ones that say ""NO"" will stay.

I would definitely recommend  visiting at least some of our Islands in the future as there is plenty to see. Specially Brač since its near Split and with it's famous 'shifting sand' beach. Also Hvar is popular with medieval city great vine cellars and vines for tasting and renown restaurant's.

Definitely visit our northern coastline too there are places and towns which easily rival beautiful and countless Italian sea resorts  such is Novi Vinodolski, Crikvenica, Rovinj, Opatija, those are some of really beautiful places and different 'flavor' then middle and southern Dalmatia.

Of course I've heard of Nottingam, wasn't also certain sheriff from there :D?

The flag is also [displayed at international communities](https://boisebasquetour.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/basquecenter.jpg) basically [all over the world](http://www.euskalkultura.com/fitxategiak/plone/images/albisteak/DSC04259.JPG).

The flag of Navarre, as cool-looking and full of history as it is, will have it very hard to replace the *ikurrina* as the Basque flag, given that its relevance as just shown is much, much greater.

It may have been designed by Arana ([although his design was somewhat different](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Flag_of_the_Basque_Country_by_Sabino_Arana.svg/200px-Flag_of_the_Basque_Country_by_Sabino_Arana.svg.png)), but I think we can agree to say the flag itself does not represent Catholicism or Aranism anymore, not by any margin.

The document actually isn't translating from ""tutturreri"" to the Italian ""pipistrello"", but from ""dottori"", which is how they used to be called in the area of Cagliari (southern Sardinia), which is an onorific meaning ""Doctor"", mentioning that ""dottori"" is an onorific given to the tutturreris.",Italy,/r/europe/comments/7bl1w1/winged_rat_blind_mouse_butterfly_of_the_night_the/dpj0kyf/,GVmG,1510157247

Homo Sapiens is a social creature, and that's exactly why we dominate the planet and won the ""homo"" race.

Poor &amp; social issue is a problem when you don't have social service or healthcare. USA is the only ""developped"" country to have such problem with drugs.

You would no that if you took a basic course around that, but of course you didn't. You went and took a course that thought nothing about business if you don't know the basics of entrepreneurship, which is that you're most likely to fail than anything else.

They don't steal other people's job when they are creating them. Yes, you have to be a workaholic to be an entrepreneur, else you fail, because it's extremely difficult to be one. That's probably why you aren't one and never bothered to do any bit of research on that.

People were always working hard throughout history, it's actually today that we have the luxury of not working 12-14 hours everyday to survive and can go see movies, or stay at home wasting time playing videogames. Life is misery, get used to that. Humans fight against misery to get comfortable in life, maybe you had too much comfort in your life to understand that. Life isn't rose, life isn't your parents home or college on a paid tuition. Money was created to help people exchange services.

Yes, that's the message of the bible. It's an observation of how the world works and has worked for at least 6000 years, it's how it must have worked 40 000 years ago too. It means if you succeed success will be easier, but if you fail, failure will be even more likely to happen again. It's a way of understanding how inequality happens without malice.

Extreme wealth is already heavily taxed, but of course you wouldn't know that, you never looked how much wealthy people pay in taxes (hint: it's most of it).

Nobody needs a GTX 1080 either, yet some people like it. Who are you to say what others need.

You talked about the 1% which is 300k a year or more, don't move the goalpost when someone points out you don't know what you're buzzwords mean and what you're talking about.

Life is precious and you should respect it, but you aren't owed anything but basic negative rights for just being alive, but of course you don't believe that as it's clear you just want to live off other people's work. You should feel shame for how little you know about people you deride.",,/r/europe/comments/7bbb8d/map_of_nationals_subreddits_where_a_hammer_and/dpiufbq/,momojabada,1510150332

The TV3 children's news program explains to Catalan children what political prisoners are TV3 continues using its children's news programs to explain to Catalan children the independence process according to the ideological prism and the style book of the public television of the Generalitat. On this occasion, the TV3 news program 'InfoK' has broadcast a piece to clarify to the minors ""what is a political prisoner"" and why it is considered that the members of the Government and the presidents of the ANC and Òmnium are. ""A political prisoner is a person who is in jail because of his political ideas, because he thinks and acts differently than the people who govern a country,"" explains the news anchor in a didactic tone. ""In the case of these people, some believe that they have been imprisoned for being pro-independence, that is to say that they are political prisoners and that it is not fair that they are in jail, but there are also many people who do not think that in Spain they do not there are political prisoners and they have to be in jail because they have committed a series of crimes, crimes considered very serious "", abounds. The program continues and asks, why a part of the Catalan Government is in jail. ""Because the Spanish Justice accuses them of skipping the rules of the Constitution, the book where the Spanish laws are collected, to achieve the independence of Catalonia,"" responds the presenter. He then underlines that the members of the Government are accused of rebellion, ""a crime that consists of causing many people to go out into the streets using violence to change basic things in a country."" ""Catalan politicians say that this is not what they have done, because of violence there has been nothing, that everything has been organized in a peaceful way, whereas a part of the Spanish Justice considers that it has. Catalans to prison, ""says the host of the program while images of children are broadcasting attending independence demonstrations held in Barcelona. The children's program also states that ""not all the politicians of the Government are in prison."" There are those who have gone to Béligca, like President Carles Puigdemont. """" They consider that in Spain the trial would not be fair "", ditch.

Il attribue une part de l'erreur au fait que le quota de 20 % d'immigrés dans les logements, qui était prévu par les théories sur l'intégration en vigueur à l'époque, n'a pas été respecté, ainsi qu'au manque de commerces et d'équipements, et au caractère refermée sur elle-même de la construction, qui n'a pas plu à tous.",France,/r/europe/comments/7bjmv8/les_espaces_dabraxas_noisylegrand_france/dpin4rb/,Pedandick,1510135916

2. what if you had monarch you couldnt rally behind? like current queens uncle was? or if harry were to become king? it just so happens that elizabeth is popular, yet many ,,scandals"" , be it financial like this one, or rumors like alleged pedofile ring, ( be as it may, that they may be just rumors ) cannot and are not properly investigated like they would be if say, your pm was under similar rumors and accusations

2273,"Note that the 1933 map already shows significant changes in the distribution of the population compared to 50 - 60 years prior, since a lot of Jews living in the Pale of settlement (modern day Poland, Ukraine, Lithuania, Belarus) fled during the pogroms started by the Russian empire.

Countries like the UK and cities like Vienna and Budapest saw their Jewish population swell and the attitude towards them change radically. In the 19th century, especially after the abolition of the ghettos, local Jews tried hard to assimilate and especially in Germany and Austria became largely indistinguishable from the local population (although they were still partly ostracized. Even the princes Rothschild were ignored at receptions at the imperial court in Vienna), often converting to Protestantism or Catholicism. The wave of refugees coming from the Tzarist empire was starkly different. They were often Orthodox Jews, spoke mainly Yiddish instead of Polish, Russian or German, came from small rural villages (German or Austrian Jews being mainly urban) and formed ghettos out of their own will like in Vienna's Leopoldstadt.

Even Hitler narrates in the Mein Kampf that he thought Jews could be assimilated, based on his experience of the Jews of Linz, but changed his mind after seeing the Jews of Vienna.

We condemn rightfully the Nazis for their crimes, but we forgot how terrible the Russian pogroms were and how far reaching their consequences have been.

Muslims have absolutely experienced institutional racism, hemmed into ghettos and ostracised from society for decades in places like France.

2422,"Damn, I'm learning more about UCSB and the area around it from your comments than I have from my older brother! The entire time he's been at UCSB he's lived in an apartment/small house-style dorm with a few other guys in Isla Vista. My brother isn't a big partier, though-he's never really been into that, plus he's focusing very hard on getting his Bachelor's in Economics with a minor in Accounting as well as I think a Sports Management certificate on top of that, plus he plays on some sort of school-affiliated baseball team that travels for a lot of their games. 

I'm just wondering, is the public transit at least decent going between Goleta and Santa Barbara since you recommended living there if you weren't bringing a car with you? My family's driven through it a few times, and it looks *super* rural to me. I'm in perfectly suburban Camarillo, which has about 62k people over like 5-8 miles (about 8.1-12.8 km) and our public transit can only be described as ""okay"", ""alright"" or ""decent"", probably ""utter shit"" if you're from somewhere like NYC or Boston. I don't know how good that area's public transit is, mostly because my older brother just took his car with him so he can more easily get around and drive between his dorm and our house in Cam. 

Definitely seconding you on how expensive Santa Barbara is! I don't even live there and know it's basically the San Francisco of Southern California as far as the juxtaposition between its ""hippie values"" and crazy-high cost of living go. Farmer's markets are the bomb!


Oooh, I fucking love Costco and Trader Joe's! Is there one in Santa Barbara? That's pretty interesting to note that there isn't a Walmart yet in a city that size. Over here in Camarillo a Walmart Neighborhood Market (basically, it just sells food and whatever else you'd find in a pharmacy store like Walgreen's or CVS) opened a few years ago-in the exact same plaza as the town's Target (which is basically Walmart for middle-class and up people in the US, complete with large grocery sections in most of them), funnily enough. Amazingly enough neither the Walmart or the Target have suffered as a result of them being literally 2-3 storefronts away from each other, as far as I can tell. I think this is probably because both have their own strong selling points-Walmart has extremely low prices for a VERY wide array of goods while Target has generally better service and a much nicer reputation and atmosphere.

Maybe this is the best explanation that I've seen. It was a combination of factors that is changing our view from Turkey, the extreme slow integration ever since the 70's End now that we see Turkey itself taking steps backwards (in our eyes) by voting a family first islamic Trump, that stops evolution education, promises family first, crashes the Lira further, plays aggressive and ends up buying Russian arms.

That combined with feeling European is so paradoxical to me, that it causes me to wonder how that could happen and Turks still feel European. It feels to me the antithesis of being European, because we see in a slightly different way middle eastern countries sliding the same path.

2445,"&gt; What would have happened is we would have developed alongside the rest of Europe.

This is conjecture. Aside from the implication that orthodox christianity was somehow going to magically join the reformation, it also carries with it the assumption that the Balkans automatically qualifies for a sort of average position in history, if only it weren't for history itself. There's no saying how much destruction would be wrought within the region itself or how quickly an outside power would have taken over, as has happened to the Balkans pretty much since the expansion of the Roman Empire.

&gt; Europe as a whole was a battleground for centuries too, yet it developed.

No it wasn't. I mean an actual battleground.

&gt; The Balkans would likely be unified under another state, be that us or perhaps Bulgaria (can´t see the Romans making a comeback), which could easily compete as an imperial power.

conjecture

&gt; The Balkans isn´t even all that bad geographically, don´t see why´d you think this.

It is economically disadvantaged with the noteworthy exception of the basins the Danube flows through. This is a story comparable to the Caucasus. I don't like invoking geographic determinism, but it's clearly not the most conducive of environments for the industrial revolution. Turkey is a case in point of a political unity trying to equalize geographically disadvantaged and advantaged regions with limited success. Making the steppe bloom is no simple task.

&gt; Either way, the conclusion is pretty clear. The Ottoman empire was far and wide the most backwards country in Europe and anyone who had to deal with them as much as we did suffered greatly.

This too is conjecture. Russia comes to mind, in various respects.

&gt; Culturally and economically the region fell behind and hasn´t recovered to this day.

It hasn't been ahead since the 10th century or so. If we don't include Greece, it has very rarely been ahead at all.

&gt; Other bad things happened too, but they can´t compare to how bad the Ottoman rule was.

Incidentally, all of the red countries are ex-communist ones. The communist countries that are blue today (with the exception of Russia) surpassed Turkey after getting immense help from western Europe and decent transitions out of communism, while the Balkans were still busy with butchery.

Sounds like someone's been playing too much Wolfenstein, chill out BJ Blazkowicz. Yeah the National Socialists wanted to wipe out the Slavs and try to enrich Central Europe with Germans, but that's the fault of the National Socialists, not the whole of the German people. Would the opposition parties that existed before the Nazi takeover be at fault? How about the descendants of them? How about the opposition members that were conscripted and forced to fight like /u/InRoyal 's great-grandfather?

&gt;just like you they haven't done anything wrong.

Exactly. Modern Germans shouldn't be held anymore responsible for what happened 70 years ago. The war passed forever ago, and we still have popular media that paint the Germans as wholly demonic evil people. I've yet to see a single piece of popular media (aside form Schindler's List but that's arguably different) that paints a picture about the Germans who didn't want to fight but were forced to.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_home_ownership_rate

After the 2008 housing crises in the US that left many countries in ruins in Europe as well, where bubbles obviously existed - it's safe to say that renting is still a smart idea. 

Notice the countries where home ownership is least are also some of the richest middle classes in the world from US/UK to Germany/HK. If you're higher on the list.. that means if there is a housing bubble, your country could suffer significantly more. 

China.. 

Notice they're at the top? Now look into North American cities where you'll see Chinese buying up so much real estate that it's causing natives to have no choice but to move due to the shear cost. The greatest fear are Chinese bubbles that are the largest in the world. 

I know many that own homes but they're all very well off, some homes were given by parents. Unless you're in that situation, renting seems to be the safest bet still.

No, you have a history of calling and trying to associate Armenia with Europe, while dissociating Armenia from the region it is in - the Middle East. In the Armenian subreddit, months back, Armenians were calling themselves European - when I objected and reminded your people of your history (majority of it residing and falling in the Middle East) I was downvoted and insulted. You also made the same accusation then.

&gt;I just find it funny how obsessed you are with the issue.

Are you sure I'm the obsessed one, are you sure you're not just self reflecting? There are multiple Armenians in this thread (without their proper flairs) so desperately trying to associate themselves with western European people. I present a counter argument which calls your people Caucasian and Near Easterner due to the genetic information available by the experts, information that is factually correct - and I am called obsessed by you and ignored by the other Armenian user who I was talking to (idontknowmuch). Would it make you happy if I deleted all my posts and said, Armenia is a European country? You guys are on the same level as Turks, so desperately trying to associate yourselves with the region. The only schtick that you have is that you're Christians in comparison to the Turks. 

So to finalize things, you and your people are obsessed. For a country that has no land in Europe, and has been the slaves of the Persians and Turks for the past several hundred years. I found it amusing that Armenians try to desperately associate themselves with Europe, while dissociate themselves from the Middle East at whatever cost that they can - stooping to the lowest of low.

The real reason is no doubt that Ottoman political integration restricted these regions from receiving the benefits and advancements that Western Europe underwent during the Enlightenment, Scientific Revolution, and Industrial Revolution. There's clearly a sharp divide here between the traditionally Habsurg countries and those that were under the Ottoman sphere. Literacy maps from the early 20th century show that literacy rates fell off a cliff when moving from areas that were previously Austria-Hungarian to those that were Ottoman.

It's not something you can blame on the Ottomans, after all they weren't at fault for being at the wrong place at the wrong time when the Enlightenment happened, but the division created by the political borders of the Ottoman and Christian empires/states prevented most of the Balkans from developing in the same way that Western Europe did.",,/r/europe/comments/7bd8qd/european_countries_richer_and_poorer_than_turkey/dpi745f/,KanchiEtGyadun,1510107734

2650,"Well...not as bad as 2008.  Maybe Spain's better  But at least in the US, I know that we've seen a pretty consistent series of bubbles.  People get excited by rising house prices, don't want to miss out, jump on, prices skyrocket from people jumping in, then people start bailing out because they don't want to ride the thing down.  And you get this boom and bust process, which I really think is kind of disruptive for the typical person.

[The Complete History Of US Real Estate Bubbles Since 1800](http://www.businessinsider.com/the-economic-crash-repeated-every-generation-1800-2012-1?op=1)

&gt;""For the first 144 years of real estate enclosure in the U.S., land sales and/or real estate construction peaked almost consistently, every 18 years,"" Anderson writes. ""The world’s worst downturns are always preceded by land speculation (the chasing of the economic rent) fueled by misguided credit creation courtesy of the banks.""

That's not really a shining record.

And there are more probable bubbles around the world now -- Canada, the UK, Australia...

And it has a really substantial impact on most people people, because they typically have a lot of their wealth tied up in real estate.  It also tends to make people working in growing areas better off and in shrinking areas even worse off.  It hurts labor mobility.

Real estate's the one market where Joe Sixpack is engaged in really hefty investments.

Maybe the world would be better-off if a lot more people rented, for example, and we had some better mechanisms to let people customize houses.

Or maybe we do a bad job of forcing areas that are in demand to permit more construction.

Or maybe people just don't really understand how much it makes sense to spend or what terms to accept, and there should be some sort of advocate there to help them through the process.  I remember a decade ago, people not understanding the implications of adjustable-rate mortgages.  In Europe, I heard about a lot of people who took out a mortgage in one currency and were paid in another.  Not sure that they understood the implications of that, and it burned a lot of people.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/7bcq0c/nearly_half_europeans_who_dont_own_home_reckon/dpi7b2g/,vokegaf,1510107945

Worst punishment you can get is probably a suspended sentence and even that will probably be for repeated offenders. A restraint order is as much as you could possibly hope for for a mild offense, which was decriminalized in Russia. So if anything, Russia is moving closer to western standards by reducing the overly severe criminal punishments for non serious offenses.

2862,"1. Back from meetings in Brussels. There's good news and bad news. First, the bad news. Because it's... extremely bad. 

2. While consensus in London seems to assume trade talks kick off in December, senior EU officials now consider this, on balance, unlikely

3. Brussels monitors UK media &amp; ministers' statements - they can see PM has been backtracking since Florence - ie backtracking to cliff-edge 

4. Behind the scenes, also evidence that UK has reneged on guarantees for citizens that it initially signalled it would make. Really bad.

5. As for money, if May insists she can't make any further commitments, EU will not trigger trade talks in December. It's that simple.

6. EU went as far as it could in Oct. Nobody's asking for precise figure, just specific commitments. €60bn the ballpark figure.

7. UK Government knows all this, incidentally. They're in denial about it. But what happens if they test EU anyway?

8. If no agreement in Dec, next opportunity to kick-start talks is in March. That leaves 7 months to agree deal. They can't, and won't.

9. All of this means, we're heading for crisis (and economic shock) very soon - December or January - unless UK comes to its senses.

10. EU fears May, when rebuffed in Dec through her instransigence, will retreat to comforting insanity of Redwood/Mogg Brexit utopia. BAD.

11. So senior EU officials now putting chances of no-deal at over 50%, and making detailed impact assessments about what it means for EU

12. EU officials don't think UK Gov working in national interest; worse, believe May &amp; Davis don't understand process, or what no-deal means

13. EU unsure whether civil servants not telling ministers truth, or if ministers just aren't listening- but UK incompetence is mystifying

14. One official agreed that Davis's recent remark on negotiations going down to wire, after EU Parl't vote, was lunacy. EP vote is final.

15. Which brings us to the centrality of the misunderstanding. Brexit is a political, but far more importantly, a legal process.

16. Article 50 rules must be obeyed. Which means, everything must be agreed by European Parliament. And that means, everything.

17. So when Davis says that we'll have a basic deal, on eg aviation, but without things we want, that must also be approved by EU Parl't.
https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DN9VDhMXcAEdohr.jpg

18. And here's the thing: it won't happen. EU conditions for deal are € above all else: if UK refuses to pay everything, no deal on anything

19. If UK planning to leave hole in EU budget, forget about 'deal no deal', 'basic deal', or 'orderly no deal'. No deal means no deal.

20. That means no aviation, drastically curbed radiotherapy. No transfer of nuclear material unless UK's undergone exhaustive IAEA process

21. EU thinks UK won't easily be able to resurrect old aviation treaties, and a new one will take 2 years. This also requires goodwill.

22. EU also fears Gov won't walk away, but just let clock tick - a no-deal by accident or incapacity. Followed by 'bloody unreasonable EU'.

23. EU also not concerned about its own unity - in a crisis, officials think member states will rally round, not peel off. Unlike in UK.

24. This, regrettably, is not the only bad news. Let's assume UK does come to its senses before December summit, and talks progress.

25. As Barnier's made clear, there's no bespoke transition. That means we have to stay in EEA, and to make that seamless, apply to join EFTA

26. EFTA officials confident UK could apply to join EFTA quite quickly &amp; provisionally apply agreement for Mar 19, seamlessly staying in EEA

27. This, provided Norway &amp; Iceland happy to let UK in for transitional period. But they would be under great pressure to allow it.

28. Might even be possible for UK to negotiate 'associate' EFTA status so doesn't have to apply to join EFTA's trade deals (big concession)

29. Only... Northern Ireland is ruined, because off-shelf EEA agreement excludes agriculture. Which means full WTO tariffs. No ifs, no buts.

30. EEA Agreement Article 19 provides framework for agri liberalisation- but needs to be negotiated from scratch. Norway's deal took 2yrs.

31. So Davis was right to say, last Tuesday, that new tariffs would be 'a real problem' for NI. It's a problem he's determined to make real.

32. So, I hear you ask, where's the good news?
Easy. If UK wants to extend A50, or revoke it, just say magic word. Even at last minute.

33. Can negotiate new aviation treaty, new agri provisions to top up EEA, or a new trade deal, while comfortably still in EU.

34. Senior officials describe difficulty of UK participating in EU elections as 'lowest priority'. Avoiding cliff-edge much more important.

35. EU doubts PM has authority to pull this off. Easier for her to drag us off cliff than show humility/common sense. But there's still time

36. It's not too late to see this cliff-edge &amp; prevent what's otherwise an unavoidable catastrophe. All they need to do is open their eyes.

37. That was the news. If anyone's friends with Theresa or David, please let them know.

I'd like to note that some people do equate capitalism with slavery, misogyny, and the other things some social justice warriors (in the most positive meaning of the term) fight. You make a good point that we should be very mindful of assigning unrelated things to ideologies-turned-buzzwords.

I believe this also shows that looking at politics through ideology isn't very appropriate. Unlike the previous several centuries, we now have much better tools to evaluate policy and to see which of it works, and which of it doesn't. This means that all that ideology should be is a set of values, not a set of policies - yet we fail to look at it this way. Everyone is guilty of this - from rent controls to opposing free trade agreements and immigration, people support bad policy based on their feelings (ideology), not on the results we've measured. 

One of the groups that still most actively focuses on their ideology are communists, so much so that they can get very angry about defending their specific branch of communism. Is that all that necessary, or should we just chill out about it and start looking at things with actual common sense?

To reiterate, the story should actually be ""The Queen paid tax on all the money her estate invested into one part of the land she rules, which is part of a diversified portfolio. Absolutely nothing has come out about any avoidance at all; opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn called for all people avoiding tax to apologise, which does not in any way actually imply the Queen as she didn't.""

&gt;Léon Joseph Marie Ignace Degrelle was a Walloon Belgian politician and Nazi collaborator, who founded Rexism and later joined the Waffen SS (becoming a leader of its Walloon contingent) which were front-line troops in German combat operations against the Soviet Union. After World War II, he was a prominent figure in fascist movements.

&gt;Severely wounded at Cherkasy in 1943, Degrelle continued to climb the Schutzstaffel (SS) hierarchy after the inclusion of Walloons in the Waffen-SS, being made an SS-Obersturmbannführer (lieutenant colonel) in the early months of 1945. He was awarded the Ritterkreuz (Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross) by Hitler. Degrelle later claimed Hitler told him, **""If I had a son, I would want him to be like you.""** Degrelle was later awarded the oakleaves (mit Eichenlaub), as were seven other non-Germans.

&gt;While in Spain, during the Franco dictatorship, Degrelle maintained a high standard of living and would frequently appear in public and in private meetings in a white uniform featuring his German decorations, while expressing his pride over his close contacts and ""thinking bond"" with Adolf Hitler. He continued to live undisturbed when Spain became democratic after the death of Franco with the help of the Gil family, and continued publishing polemics, voicing his support for the political far right. He became active in the Neo-Nazi Círculo Español de Amigos de Europa (CEDADE), and ran its printing press in Barcelona, where he published a large portion of his own writings, including an Open Letter to Pope John Paul II on the topic of the Auschwitz concentration camp, asking the Pope not to go.

&gt;His repeated statements on the topic of Nazi genocide brought Degrelle to trial with Violeta Friedman, a Romanian-born Venezuelan survivor of the camps. Although lower courts were initially favourable to Degrelle, the Supreme Court of Spain decided he had offended the memory of the victims, both Jews and non-Jews, and sentenced him to pay a substantial fine. Asked if he had any regrets about the war, his reply was **""Only that we lost!""**",Belgium,/r/europe/comments/7bewj4/til_of_léon_degrelle_a_belgian_nazi_collaborator/dphf91q/,Boomtown_Rat,1510077915

&gt; The basic agreement is that the Queen gets the grant in exchange for surrendering all profits from the Crown Estate - the Royal family's massive portfolio of properties - to the government. Every year, the Queen is given an amount of money equivalent to 15% of the Crown Estate's profits from two years ago.

&gt;For example: In 2013, the Crown Estate generated a profit of £267.1 million (about $325.8 million). That means, in 2015, the Queen's Sovereign Grant was 15% of that total - that's £40.1 million (or $48.9 million).

This is the grant the Government is trying to lower as the value of the Crown Estate is growing faster than her stipend.

Text:


&gt;&gt; it tends to result in people pilling up on top of each other, reaffirming the in group, but hostile towards the out group.

&gt; That's the definition of nationalism.

Fact: that is not the definifition of nationalism, this is the definition of nationalism:

1.Patriotism; the idea of supporting one's country, people or culture.

2.Support for the creation of a sovereign nation (which does not currently exist). 

3.(Britain, Ireland) Support for the union of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.

4.Jingoism; the support of one nation's interests to the exclusion of others.

And here is the source:
https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/nationalism

Since it is clear that usage of ""nationalist"" in the Catalan context refers to the second definition and the last definition is irrelevant (and still doesn't match what you said), your argument is nonsensical.

So there is a fact and a source that proves you wrong, just based on the latest comment you posted.

3187,"Personally, I don't think so. For several reasons, but I'll tell you two big ones (for me).

First of all, Spain is a very obvious example of a synergy. There is absolutely no way the 45 millions of what is Spain today could live, collectively, better on their own. Catalonia has an economy which depends (80%) on the rest of Spaniards buying products either made there, or by companies whose HQ is conveniently located in Barcelona. 

So, after 30 years of enjoying more autonomy than German Länders, Catalonia has managed to fall behind Madrid, become the hottest jihadist spot in Europe and all in all, doing nothing good at all, compared to the rest of the Spanish regions.

I'm not a fan of centralization. But what Catalonia does, for example, to Barcelona, is exactly the very same thing they speak against when it comes to the Spain and Catalonia relationship. 

Second reason would be that I believe in Spain as a country, and I believe our similarities are bigger than our differences. Having your own culture is not basis for making new borders. Hell, Murcia (one of the poorest and much maligned regions in Spain) is OOZING with its own culture, Carthago and such.

Spain is old. Very old. Its roots dig deep in history and it's a crucible of cultures, so to speak. But being together is what we've always done, and we've done good. And we can do better. 

And I would like Catalans by my side while we keep finding skeletons from the Civil War and we keep closing wounds and reconciling ourselves with our own history, if we are to have a nice future.

I believe Catalan separatism is very, very dependant on the crisis. Populist have promised a fresh start, in a ""rich country"", without mentioning how dependent this region is of the rest of Spain, with no corruption (seriously LOL), and no dictatorships in its history, etc.

Socialism works, and if socialism works then it means that also communism can work, but it has to be implemented differently and it has to be kept in check.

3265,"In Bosnia your ethnicity is determined by your religion
* In the last census, you could not state Bosnian as your ethnicity. You had to either be a Bosniak, a Serb, a Croat or... wait for it ... The Rest! 
* So, let me say this one more time, you were born in Bosnia, but your country Bosnia does not let you say you are Bosnian. This would be equivalent if people in Britain (which is also a geographical term just like some say Bosnia is) were not allowed to state they were British. How many people there would belong to The Rest?
* Around a third of Bosnians (and half of the land allegedly too) think they are Serbian
* The remaining two thirds would rather suffer through 3 years of starvation, ethnic cleansing, sieges, bombings, brutal killings, torture and rape than be Serbian
* Some say that Bosnians had a medieval state but that is not true. Only Serbia's medieval state is valid, as that was written by God himself, his angels and the most objective human being in the known universe Dr. Voja Seselj
* Dr Voja Seselj is also a Bosnian. So are the Serbian-: president Vucic, the late former prime-minister Dzindzic and the one-time leader of the opposition Draskovic. Hm. I think I understand why Serbians want to annex Bosnian territory so much - their politicians are sick of life in diaspora!
* The administrative apparatus that Bosnia supports would bankrupt even a rich country like Germany. What people don't know is that the administrative apparatus is there to provide employment for the voters. So, if you were employed by the party X, you are not very likely ever to vote for the party Y, as they would get rid of you and put their man in your place. (Come to think of it, it probably is Germany that is paying for that circus)
* In the late 80s and the early 90s, the Bosnian people were warned: ""If you vote for nationalist parties there will be a war."" So around 80% of people went and voted for nationalist parties. I guess you know what happened then. (Up yours, Project Fear!)
* The flag was chosen by the international community because Serbs and Croats did not want a flag that refers to Bosnia as a state or to Bosnian history, heritage, culture, ethnicity or people in any way. The flag is made up of completely random symbols and colours",,/r/europe/comments/7b7i4k/what_do_you_know_about_bosnia_and_herzegovina/dph1qds/,youllneed,1510063857

3406,"A 42-year-old Pole drove a car under the influence of alcohol in the Netherlands. As a result of daring driving, he first cut off the town from nearby Amsterdam, and then crashed into the pond.

The event took place last Friday, November 3. The inhabitants of the town of Tar Aar near Amsterdam were cut off from the current about 1 hour. 22:40.

The car was driven by a 42-year-old Pole. By dashing the car, he hit the car in an electrical switchboard, causing the lights to go out for hours. Then, driving down the Hertog van Beijerenstraat, he did not notice the turn and fell out of the way. He drove straight to a nearby pond.

Police, fire brigade and rescue helicopter were called in.

""The driver was able to get himself out of the vehicle, so the guards and the air ambulance were canceled,"" the 112reg.nl portal says.

The man had no injuries. The breath test showed that he had more than 1.5 calories of alcohol in his blood.


A 42-year-old Pole has lost his driving license. It also turned out that he was carrying a valid vehicle registration certificate, so he was taken away from the car.

3421,"&gt; There was no way they could have justified joining the Euro while the pound was doing well

Yes there was, there are the political implications of doing so as it was tie the UK closer to the EU. The economics regarding euro  aren't as bad as people make them out be, while it is true as a currency that it is flawed it is hard a doomed project and is still attractive to some countries. The Baltic states joined post crisis. Also it wouldn't a as unpopular as you seem to think as people would quickly adapt like they do for any other change. Just like how people in eurozone countries have and in most it is very popular today, even in places like Spain and Greece.

&gt;specially after the damage the ERM fiasco did to the credibility of EU monetary directives in the UK

The ERM fiasco was the UK government's fault and could have been easily avoided if they were closer to the rates of the Deutschmark 

&gt; Do you understand the sheer fucking cheek of setting up a policy which caused recessions in the UK

You are aware that the euro didn't cause the recession? It hit the UK and America as well. The reason that it was made worse was because of the bad policies, such as austerity by the ECB and the uncompetitiveness of the countries involved. Spain had a huge property bubble and Greece lied about its debt in order to get into the euro, so it wasn't like it wasn't known at the time. 

&gt;The EU was trying to sell cruise tickets to the survivors of the titanic

I think it is safe to stop predicting the end of the euro by now. It is just tedious 

&gt;Brown and Blair did their level best to sell the idea, but it would 
have been political suicide.

Brown was pretty skeptical about the euro, it was more of Tony Blair's thing.

However, your perception of the level of federalisation in the EU is a bit off. Point by point:

- The single currency and fiscal policy were decided by treaty change, and Britain got to opt out. There is no way to force anyone else to join up, that's why at over 15 years after the full introduction of the euro it still isn't a member, and neither are Sweden or Denmark.

- The extension of Schengen is also decided in the Council, i.e. by member state governments. Member states have [in the past blocked the extension of Schengen](https://www.schengenvisainfo.com/schengen-agreement/) so it is in their control.

- The debate on military union didn't start this year, it started over 60 years ago and we're as far off as we ever were. This again is fully under the control of member state governments.

- Pan-European political parties sort of exist already, because national parties collaborate in the European Parliament under a common name. They are not in any way forced to change their stances in domestic political policies as a result though.

Anyway, as someone who has studied the EU academically, I would say in broad outline the member states are in control of what the EU looks like: they are the 'masters of the Treaties', in the words of probably the single most important scholar of European integration studies, Andrew Moravcsik. This is even more so the case since the financial crisis. The Commission's job is to promote initiatives that further European integration, but whether or not they happen is up to the member states. So any of Juncker's public pronouncements should also be seen in that light.

I remember when Putin decided to wage war against NGO's despite most of them being in Russia to begin with due to the poverty of the country. And when Putin wanted to fight against the Americans, he did so by banning Americans from adopting Russian children. US being the top country for adopting Russian children. That'll show them! 

Then again this is the same country that after illegally annexing Crimea, was sanctioned by the West, even Japan. Sanctioned hit, the currency plummeted, prices for food skyrocketed. Guess what food Putin put a price cap on? It wasn't bread or milk. Wasn't eggs or even potatoes. It was vodka. He only later changed that, but who needs to eat when they can drink their sorrows away. 

But it's good to see Putin propaganda still works, having Russian's believe that most NGO's are foreign agents (2013 Russian media started blasting this conspiracy).   ",,/r/europe/comments/7b5fn9/debunked_russian_sanctions_are_not_sinking_the/dpgp0zd/,irishtayto,1510035070

PRUSSIA
OR GERMAN EMPIRE

* A proverb says: Nothing happens by chance,
* Providence sticks her nose in everywhere.
* To satisfy some sovereign ambition
* Human charity is silenced,
* The massacre of a country is not cared about:
* Providence is already footing the bill;
* Wisdom sucks the blood and it turns to gold:
* Providence already bears the laurel for it;
* Exultantly, at the humbled and defeated,
* Brennus’ *woe!* is shouted;  elsewhere the lash
* Makes law on the back of the damn idiot.
* Providence... oh despair!
* One can thus no longer kill 
* Without providence having to muscle in.

3683,"President Clinton flew to Moscow to meet with Putin. Putin was slouched, legs spread apart, acting like he was bored and he had more important things to do than to talk with the POTUS. Clinton picked up on that of course, he also picked up on Putin's views that deeply bothered the president. 

What he had hoped to be a warm welcome became cold.

While in Russia he goes to meet his old friend, Boris Yeltsin. He bear hugs Clinton, they were genuinely happy to see each other. The cameras go away and it's just Yeltsin and Clinton. The two were brutally blunt with each other so Clinton waste no time in telling Yeltsin of his opinion of Putin. He tells Yeltsin that he was disturbed by him and that he doesn't have democracy in his heart. Clinton pokes his finger at Yeltsin's hear and says it again to drive the point home. 

Yeltsin was a drunk but no fool. He took was Clinton said as serious I'm sure but there's no evidence to suggest that he (at the time) thought Putin would dismantle the very democracy he had built.

2) Bosnian muslims (bosniaks) claim to speak the bosnian language, which is identical to serbo-croatian, a composite language that is in fact just Serbian or Croatian, depending on who you ask. Serbs tend to drop the Lj and they tend to speak faster. So they sound more Italian to a foreigner (particularly to english speakers) than most balkan language speakers. Croatians tend to borrow (cough steal cough) words from Russia just so they don't sound like Serbs.

3) Bosniak muslims are more moderate than most American Christians, they drink alcohol, eat pork when abroad, etc. 

Yet the country plays host to the biggest extremist Saudi-born community in the balkans. Up to 5,000 ex-head hunting jihadists reside in and around Sarajevo. Bosniaks refer to them as 'medieval cretins'. Authorities pay close attention to these culturally alien communities.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography_of_Australia

&gt;Until the Second World War, the vast majority of settlers and immigrants came from the British Isles, and a majority of Australians have some British or Irish ancestry. These Australians form an ethnic group known as Anglo-Celtic Australians. In the 2016 Australian census, the most commonly nominated ancestries were:[36]
&gt;
&gt;* English (36.1%)
&gt;* Australian (33.5%)[37]
&gt;* Irish (11.0%)
&gt;* Scottish (9.3%)
&gt;* Chinese (5.6%)
&gt;* Italian (4.6%)
&gt;* German (4.5%)
&gt;* Indian (2.8%)
&gt;* Greek (1.8%)
&gt;* Dutch (1.6%).

-

&gt; Christianity is the predominant faith of Australia, though this is diminishing. In an optional question on the 2016 Census, 52.1% of the Australian population declared some variety of Christianity. Historically the percentage has been far higher and the religious landscape of Australia is changing and diversifying.[39] Also in 2016, 30.1% of Australians stated ""no religion"" and a further 9.6% chose not to answer the question.[39] The remaining population is a diverse group which includes Muslims (2.6%), Buddhists (2.4%), Hindus (1.9%), Sikhs (0.5%), and Jews (0.4%).[39][40]

3788,"&gt;
More than half the EU’s member states are expected to sign up within days to a landmark joint defence effort in response to pressures on the continent’s militaries.
&gt;
Germany and France have led the attempt to persuade countries to pool military logistics and crisis response troops while co-operating to develop weapons such as a new generation of tanks.
&gt;
Supporters see the so-called permanent structured co-operation on defence (Pesco) as a way to deal with defence budget restrictions and US calls for European countries to shoulder more of the burden for the continent’s security.
&gt;
However, attempts to agree the initiative have revealed strains between Paris and Berlin. France wants Pesco to be as ambitious as possible in terms of the projects it takes on, while Germany wants it to include the maximum number of countries. 
&gt;
Nathalie Tocci, director of the Institute of International Affairs think-tank in Rome, said Pesco needed to be a “game changer” after years of stuttering EU efforts on defence co-operation. “Unless you have the legal, political and financial commitments to make the Europeans seriously wake up on defence, it’s not going to happen,” said Ms Tocci, who is also an adviser to Federica Mogherini, the EU’s foreign policy chief.
&gt;
A central aim of Pesco is to cut problems of interoperability that stem from the variety of weapons systems used in Europe. Pesco will also play to the trend of countries attempting to save money by combining resources for projects such as a Franco-German plan announced in July to build a new European fighter jet.
&gt;
EU states that want to sign up to Pesco expect to give formal notice of their plans at a meeting of European foreign and defence ministers on November 13, according to union diplomats. Paris and Berlin will be joined by other big country capitals including Rome and Madrid, with a view to launching the project formally at an EU leaders’ summit in December.
&gt;
Two-thirds or more of EU member countries might sign up initially, officials said, although they warned that the number was still fluid. “We are still in a very delicate decision-making phase and there are a number of national internal balances that could shift,” said one diplomat.
&gt;
Tomas Valasek, director of Carnegie Europe, says the emerging Pesco “is a far cry” from the original French idea.
&gt;
“Paris wanted a small group of capable countries that would group around French armed forces and conduct intervention missions together, on behalf of the EU. Under German prodding Pesco has been enlarged,” Mr Valasek said.
&gt;
“It will still be useful as a matchmaking for countries that want to buy or develop new weapons together. This is hardly trivial — the way European countries spend their defence money is very inefficient.”
&gt;
Pesco is also seen as an umbrella for regional defence operations similar to existing co-operation between the Belgian and Dutch navies or the European Air Transport Command, which involves the Netherlands, Belgium, France and Germany.
&gt;
Joint medical operations and a European crisis response force are among other ideas that have been discussed.
&gt;
Pesco’s backers insist the initiative is complementary to the operations of Nato, which will retain the primary role for the continent’s territorial defence. 
&gt;
International events have lent urgency to the Pesco effort, with heightened uncertainty over European security, Russia’s annexation of Crimea and the commitment of President Donald Trump’s administration to Nato.
&gt;
The US has also raised the pressure on the many European countries that fall short of Nato’s requirement to spend the equivalent of at least 2 per cent of gross domestic product on defence.
&gt;
Pesco’s backers also say it will show the EU’s continued cohesion and purpose after Brexit removes the UK, one of Europe’s leading military powers, from the bloc.
&gt;
London has made it clear that is keen to co-operate with the EU on defence after the Brexit date of March 2019. Details have yet to be settled for the possible participation in Pesco of non-EU members, including countries such as Norway, union diplomats say.",The Netherlands,/r/europe/comments/7bb51k/eu_states_poised_to_agree_joint_defence_pact/dpgnmxo/,DetlefKroeze,1510032495

Around 450 T-80 MBTs are currently in service with the Russian Army. Already in January I speculated that the upgrade announcements could imply trouble in the Armata program:
&gt;
&gt;&gt;The Russian Ministry of Defense’s decision to upgrade older T-72 and T-90 models could be interpreted as a sign that despite earlier announcements, the T-14 will not replace the Soviet-era tanks as the mainstay of Russia’s tank force in the near future and that the Russian Ground Forces will continue to operate various MBT variants at least for the next decade. As I reported elsewhere (See: “Russia’s Military to Receive 100 New T-14 Armata Battle Tanks”), the Russian defense ministry concluded a contract with Uralvagonzavod (UVZ) for the first batch of 100 T-14 MBTs only in September 2016.

Using the same logic, of majority of Turkey being in the Middle East, therefore it's a Middle Eastern country... Majority of Istanbul is in Europe, therefore it's a European city... 

Only 1/3 of the population lives across the Bosporus, in the ""Middle Eastern"" side, which is only defined by crossing a bridge that takes 5 minutes to get across. 2/3 of the population, and majority of the economic and historical centers of the city reside within the European portion.

Your opinions of Georgia and Armenia in respect to Azerbaijan? Your opinions of Russia with respect to Kazakhstan?

Kazakhstan is a border nation to Russia, which is a border nation to Ukraine, Belarus and the other states. They have geographical land in Europe. Kazakhstan is a huge country, and in respect to their entire country, their geographical land in Europe may appear small... But they have more land in Europe than majority of European countries in terms of area... 

Kazakhstan is 2,700,000 km^2 in terms of area, 10% of their land is in Europe. 10% of 2,724,900 km^2 is 272, 490 km^2

Why doesn't it seem useful, when that is how Turkey is defined by in terms of reality. They have land in both Asia and Europe, what is not transcontinental about that? What is not useful about labeling and defining Turkey a transcontinental country?

You want absolutes? You want to either label Turkey an Asian or European country? This poses many other further questions, if we consider all of Turkey 'Asian,' what do we consider Greece, which is attached to the European territory of Turkey? Does Greece become Asian as well despite what geographical boundaries of Europe we know of?

Then there is the discussion of culture, my Middle Eastern Abrahamic religion is more European than your Middle Eastern Abrahamic religion. Who are people really trying to kid? Jesus was a brown Jew from Bethlehem. Jesus and Christianity define European culture?

I thought Christianity brought Europe decades of misery and regression, while the Middle East progressed. There is a reason Europe embraced secularism and went through the process of (for example) the Renaissance... There was a whole period in Europe where they were burning intellectuals and individuals for sinning... And another decade where Europeans pushed to separate themselves from religion to progress their continent. Christianity is still the forefront of European culture and civilization? Pathetic

The USA has the advantage that they have big pure software companies that tend to strangle upcoming european ones by buying them and then not growing them, and frankly stronger anti-trust/protectionist measures would be good for Europe there. 

Most of Europes strengths in software development seems to be located in companies that are not purely software companies and thus they get much smaller visibility to the public when it comes to those areas. 

So how would I compare the USA to Europe when it comes to AI and software in general? The USA is definetely the strongest country in the world when it comes to that, but keep in mind that the USA is also by far the biggest developed country in the world by population. Some individual European countries can equal (or even exceed, by a small margin) the USA on a per capita basis in those areas but Europe as a whole does not, but then keep in mind that much of Europe is still recovering from the yoke of Russian communism and to a lesser degree the destruction of the world wars whos shadow is still visible on the European economies. 

Europe is ahead of the USA in some areas right now, but the USA still has the advantage as a whole. But I would bet on that advantage shrinking over the coming decades as the less developed parts of Europe continue to rapidly develop. 

Rockstar programmer is a term I would avoid, as it's not very clear what it means. The big US software companies have problems in that they heavily screen for only the best programmers. I'm not sure that their screening methods works, but they certainly have attracted the people with the most talent before. They have gotten worse and worse reputation though, especially as talented programmers get disillusioned with the amount of menial and boring work they have to when they work for these companies simply becouse that is the work they need done (most software development the world over is very menial and not very exciting, but is none the less important to get done).

That is perhaps because you yourself are not European. Europe is, and always will be, far more than the ideological paradise which  you mistakenly believe it to be. Some Europeans hold certain values dearly, others do not - when you impose your own value system onto the people of Europe you do them a disservice. Europeans frequently hold values which are incompatible with those of other Europeans, that does not now - nor will it ever - make them less European.",,/r/europe/comments/7b50g4/swedes_hit_out_at_tax_avoidance_exposed_in/dpg96ka/,newcount22,1510014274
3954,"Honestly it's mostly because girls have a different atitude towards school than boys. On average they are more dutiful about what you have to do in school and grades are also often more important to them. Of course male teachers who will give girls better grades for their looks exist but I don't think its overwhelmingly statistically relevant. I mean I managed to get a final exam with 0.8 simply by doing the stuff we had to do, the best girl in my year got 1.5. And I wouldn't even say I was as dutiful as some of the girls in my class, I always did everything the last moment, went to school with only few hours or no sleep and skipped classes one time or the other when I finished too late (and also some of the art classes because our teacher was really bad). The only thing I did to get the grades was to try to find some personal interest or something to learn from the things we had to work with. I think many boys were likely to just cut it at some point, to skip some of the assignments (for instance when we had to read certain books, at times 80 % of those who had actually done so were girls) and to hand in papers that they were not actually satisfied with, while girls were more likely to be more focussed about it. 

In Denmark it's even more obvious, they even have a word for girls who want to get tp grades, ""tolv-tals-piger"", never heard about a similar word existing for boys because the same phenomenon does not exist. 

The problem is that the school system rewards obedience too much and encourages thinking for yourself too little, not that the teachers are sexist. At my school they were actually reasonably good at that by comparisson but they still got the same system and form of education which just doesn't promote intrinsic motivation. An example is that people said about our history teacher that she only gave good grades to the answers if they could be found in the book but that actually wasn't true because I always got the best grades just by speaking/writing my mind. The problem is that if you speak your mind and your argument is bad or if you miss to properly construct your paper, you're slapped too hard and often not really told in a way you could understand what went wrong (while answers from the book will always go). Further how to even make a good argument is barely taught at all when it should be at the very core of our school system.

I don't want to bore you with a diatribe, but the UK within a reformed eurozone would probably challenge the dollar as the global reserve currency. The UK within an unreformed eurozone is just more petrol on the fire. A reformed eurozone without the UK has its merits but is firmly in third place behind the US and China, mainly because of its self defeating protectionist instincts that will soon go unchallenged.

For all the damnation put on the UK over Brexit, it is very easy to forget that the eurozone has been a global laughing stock for close to a decade and only appears stable now due to huge levels of QE that has shifted into buying corporate debt.

For a leave sympathiser, I am very open to a hugely reformed, accountable federal Europe. It's not a horror but an aspiration, but the European project so far has been managed horrendously. If I have to chose between the UK as a sovereign nation, and all the volatility with it, or a member of a mismanaged, undefined sociology project, its an easy choice.

My pleasure. The chance to have a nice lengthy conversation on the Internet doesn't abound nowadays. And I'm not talking only about Catalonia's issue...

&gt; This is a serious issue though. How did they do this exactly?

Oh, that's easy: [they passed it as a normal law](http://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/20170908/431118424928/parlament-aprueba-ley-transitoriedad.html). They managed to do so because [4 out of 7 members](https://www.parlament.cat/web/composicio/president-mesa/index.html) of the Parliament's Bureau are from JxSí. 

It helped that over two months beforehand [independentist parties amended the parliament's regulations](http://noticias.juridicas.com/base_datos/CCAA/602523-reforma-parcial-parlamento-27-jul-2017-ca-cataluna-reglamento-del-parlamento.html) to introduce a special express procedure they would later use for the referendum law and the law of juridical transition. That procedure was used to limit the participation of opposition groups and, in practice, ignore the  [*Consell de Garanties Estatutàries*](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consejo_de_Garant%C3%ADas_Estatutarias_de_Catalu%C3%B1a).

This Council of Statutory Guarantees is an advisory body created by the Catalan statute of autonomy (art. 76-77)precisely to check that Catalan institutions don't break the *estatut* or other laws. Their verdicts [are binding](http://www.boe.es/boe/dias/2009/03/27/pdfs/BOE-A-2009-5085.pdf) for anything that affects the rights and duties of the Catalan citizens. Back during the amendment of the Parliament's rules, [it warned in an official ruling](https://www.cge.cat/admin/uploads/docs/20170712131231-2.pdf) that such an amendment could violate the *estatut*. When the referendum law the *Ley de Transitoriedad* were passed, [it stated](https://www.cge.cat/admin/uploads/docs/20170926153435-2.pdf) ([twice](https://www.cge.cat/admin/uploads/docs/20170926153614-2.pdf)) that the Parliament's Bureau wasn't allowed to ignore the right of opposition parties to ask the Council for a verdict.

Now, the largest they sell is 100ml,  €15.40 and has no nic. 

But you get around it by buying separately VG and PG. €11 (1+1l)lt. However for nicotine, you need the ""additive"", which is €3.85 per 180mg of nic (10ml 18mg/ml). For 1.5g it's 8 x 3.85 = €30.

And so on.

Now, whoever wants to bring some whataboutism to the table, please remember that we ourselves should be reaching for higher standards, instead of shrugging at a blatant violation of human rights, just because others are in there too.

The argument about the law being passed in a democratic manner doesn't hold up either, if we look at the Spanish election law, and how, for the past three decades, the two big parties have been updating it, in order to remain in power. Also, less than 25% of the adult population in Spain voted for the PP in 2011. I know, I know, this is how elections work, but [look at the numbers](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elecciones_generales_de_Espa%C3%B1a_de_2011), and tell me if anything looks off when, if IU had the same votes as the winning party, they'd be still trailing by, at least, 50 seats.

Europeans from outside Spain don't seem to understand that, for the sake of ""stability"", there's no way any alternative is going to win. Ever. And no controversial laws that might hurt either PP or PSOE would be passed. Ever. And if this law, the so called ""ley mordaza"", passed, is because those voters, who gave an edge to the PP, are OK with it, but they're actually a minority who happened to live where their votes are slightly more valuable than others.

4274,"As somebody who works in procurement, the two companies I've worked for (still working for one) have spent £500m and £300m respectively with suppliers, a significant portion of which is from Europe.

My last company was a food company. For some of those goods, e.g. tomatoes, we are totally dependent on European countries for our production. The Canaries - for fresh varieties, as well as mainland Spain; and Italy for any of the long-life canned varieties. Nowhere currently produces the volume we consume and the quality we expect at the price we afford to pay. Yet we're just one customer - you see, Spain is shipping these to France, Germany etc. in similar quantities. 

This presents us with multiple problems if we don't have some kind of reasonable deal or projections in place:

1. We have to look elsewhere. USA = air freight = £££. China = poor quality. Both = changes in chemical regulations (i.e. what's approved by the FSA)

2. We are at the mercy of exporters - basically, whatever they want to charge us we will have to pay, plus tax, because we have no leverage.

3. Low priority - because hey, we left the EU, when there's drought or poor crops the EU will put up barriers to trade and we will be bottom of the list.

And that's just one example. Tomatoes. People it them every day.

The same logic can be applied to most things not manufactured in the UK that we import. 

It fucks us over with everything we import and we don't have a contingency or any massive leverage because WE ARE NOT THAT IMPORTANT.

What can they do? Stop SWIFT? Who cares, Russia already has a  backup system. And if it will be the only way to pay for gas then other countries would have to use it. Stop buying Russian gas?  Yes, that will hurt Russia, but think 2 steps ahead. What will happen after that: 1. Production in Europe will become more expensive. 2. Russia will have a shit ton of gas to sell. Who will buy it? China. And in this situation, China will negotiate a hell of a price for itself. So now, you made production in Europe even more expensive, and production in China even cheaper. Sounds like fun?

4414,"We do seem to have similar problems. It is difficult to pin down what has happened in the Anglosphere, but I think that we all suffer from economic and social anxiety stemming from the fact that our living standards are either falling or stagnant and ready to fall. We all have (relative to Europe) low-tax, low-regulation social democratic states that seem to want to prioritize GDP growth by increasing third-world immigration, protecting our tech industries from regulation, and adding ""flexible"" low-paid temporary work instead of focusing on developing and taxing heavy industry (like Germany or Japan). 

This political arrangement does nothing to allay the material concerns of the working and middle classes. No policies are aimed at improving their lot. The right-wing ""nationalists"" seem just as unsatisfied as the rest of us with the inadequacies of our welfare state, but they insist that all the problems we face stem solely from overgenerous immigration. Despite popular suspicion of banks and big business, even on the right, our right-wing parties still want to flirt with becoming a tax haven and stubbornly insist on discredited trickle down economic theories. Tony Abbott probably embodies this odd populism more than even Trump does. In Canada, we see the absurdity of *Quebec* nationalists--who traditionally loathe Americans--adopting Trump-style populist policies.

For their part, the left-wing seem unusually allied with (and perhaps beholden to) huge monopolies (e.g. Google) that employ very few people given their size, and do not share the left wing parties' traditional interest in improving the lives of working people. Hence, we get (at best) a Corbyn agenda: working class people (who ending up working for Deliveroo and earning a pittance) must permit the diversification of their country, whatever their economic or social anxiety, in return for a halfhearted commitment to social democratic microfixes to the existing welfare state (e.g. Obamacare). To be interested in majoritarian concerns--or even to presume that, beyond sexual, religious, or cultural differences, there even *is* a majority of citizens interested in any particular concern--is to be seen as suspiciously reactionary. 

Both sides seem more interested in playing out the endgame of the American culture wars of the 1960s than in even discussing contemporary challenges to our societies. In Canada, as in the UK (I don't know about Aus or NZ), it doesn't really matter that these issues (e.g. affirmative action/race or gender quotas) were never the focal points of politics in the past--the Americans have exported both sides of the conflict to our political parties, and we fight this fight instead of trying to do something new.

I don't know what the future holds, but I am glad I no longer live in Canada. In ten years it has remade the political landscape in such a way that no policies are possible to benefit average working people (whatever their race or religion). Even if someone were to do so tomorrow, the left would denounce them as a racist (for putting an abstract ""average working person"" ahead of the particular identitarian interests of ""marginalized groups"") and the right would call them a globalist (for conceding that the public interest could and should benefit new immigrants and the poor--at the cost of wealthy, culturally ""acceptable"" Canadians--so long as they work just as everyone else does).

4416,"&gt;  if all tax dodging were just about ""foreign income"", we would see immense amounts of such income be generated in tax havens.

Not really. Suppose I get income from countries A, B, C. 

It naturally makes sense to set up a legal entity in the country with lowest tax rate. Suppose that's C.

So e.g if I have customer in country A, he send money to my bank account in country C. Can country A tax this transaction? Not really, it's an import of a service, and it's not taxed as income.

So if you want to ""fix"" this ""problem"", you'll have to implement a lot of restrictions, e.g. forbid free import of goods and services; disallow people to create legal entities in foreign jurisdictions, etc.

People who have regular jobs see this as some horrible loopholes, but this is just how business works. And you can't really fix this without removing freedoms which existed for centuries.

&gt; Couldn't you just directly state your case as for why tax dodging is ok?

I'm not saying it's OK, I'm saying that this is how international business works.

Do you want to make it possible for people to do business regardless of countries they are citizens of?

If you do, then loopholes will exist.

As far as I can see that's still a small decrease, whereas the UK has experienced an increase. That suggests that the UK is creating more jobs than Norway.

a lot of people back then where crippled for life and denied medical costs also, the protest was peacefully till rioting police arrived and they shot at every person (also under Mariano Rajoy's regime)

then since you lack knowledge how Europe works, there are certain laws to be complied with when joining Europe

you may find this strange because you seem unaware of this but these laws prevent countries like Turkey from joining. without them any European memberstate could turn in to Russia or Turkey for example

Article 6, 7, 10, 14, 17, Protocol 4, 7 have been violated multiple times on multiple occasions the lastest was jailing those 8 ministers without the right to an attorney, also there are still protesters in jail from more then 2 weeks ago without trial or right to an attorney

Resolution 1031 (1994): 7. Persistent failure to honour commitments freely entered into will have consequences however. For this purpose, the Assembly could use the relevant provisions of the Council of Europe's Statute and of its own Rules of Procedure, as well as paragraph 2 of Order No. 488 (1993).

besides all this, Spain already has a long dirty history of not obeying European laws most of those violations where committed under Mariano Rajoy's regime im not only talking about the lastest happenings with Catalonia but the list of violations goes on and on beyond the horizon

I have to say that your judgement is not that all accurate. the ""different treatment"" was given exclusively because he went for full cooperation answering the questions from all the parties, prosecutor, judge and defense attorney. The rest of the people had sent a petition to the suspension of the hearing because they argued that they didn't have time to prepare their defense. That petition arrived the same morning and the judge didn't see it until after the hearing. Still, they could have asked for the suspension right at that moment but didn't. Instead, they chose to only answer the questions of their defense attorneys and hence the difference in treatment.

4541,"&gt; What they were elected to do is unconstitutional so that seems like a moot point to me. I know it's a very legalist argument but Spain is a democracy and has rule of law, and if you allow it to be violated like this then you open a can of worms not just here but across the EU in the future. There has been ample opportunity to demand more competences, to negotiate for more control of finances, but they pushed on illegally into unilateral independence.

What you seem to be forgetting is that in a democracy, the rule of law should derive its power from the peoples consensus. At the moment, it seems that the spanish constitution no longer has the peoples consensus in Catalonia. This should already be an indication that the constitution should be amended (which PSOE and PP kept refusing) in the first place.

&gt;And that government was elected only by about half of Catalans, seems to me like a low number of people to base a unilateral declaration of independence on. Either way, their being elected on independence ideas or not, I don't think it gives them the right to bypass the constitution they're party to and have agreed to abide by.

I personally have the opinion that in an ideal world the UDI would not have been necessary as Spain would have already realized that the constitution no longer holds sufficient public support in Catalonia. If &gt;40% of the population is unhappy with the status quo, that already should be signal that maybe the status quo is untenable in the longer run.

That said, the world isn't ideal and Spain kept and keeps refusing all dialogue, hiding behind the constitution to not have to face the reality that their constitution has insufficient public support in Catalonia in the first place.",,/r/europe/comments/7axelg/excatalan_leader_hands_himself_in_to_police/dpf6i23/,Squalleke123,1509970324

4665,"I am no 100% knowledgeable about Portugal and Spain history but no it was not a colony.

After the defeat of Prussia, the kingdom of Spain was an ally with domestic troubles and opposing  factions at the royal court some being pro-French. The invasion of Portugal was by the way done by both French and Spanish forces.

To be short and to avoid to say too much and increasing the chances to say BS, I will go from the more obvious to the less obvious.

1. Spain is occupied by French forces after the abdication of Charles IV and ensuing unrests against French troops. To keep Spain as an ally, Napoleon's brother Joseph is to be made king of Spain. So Spain is to stay a State albeit part of ""French Continental System"". The real French Empire is rather small most of the territory defeated are turned into more ore less willing *sattelite states*, their foreign policy dependent of the hegemon, France. They had to blockade Britain and support Napoleon's war effort. But they did had to a strong ideological allegiance to the French and in theory could keep in theory full control of its domestic policy. So not a colony.

2. It was nevertheless an invaded kingdom with occupaying forces. Joseph implemented a serie of administratives and legal reforms but the both local insurgencies and the war effort impede his efforts as the french local military authorities and its requirement kept the population unhappy. But did the French or the French king of Spain discriminated the local population? No. Firstly because Spain is *Ancien Regime* society before the French invasion the same way France was before its Revolution. There has been statues with privileges before and (secondly) Jospeh didn't change much of that system of old, mainly becaude he governs Spain with Spanish people who had their insterests in the current situation. 

3. Quid of Catalonia? Jospeh reign last from 1808 to 1813 but in 1812 for routhly one years, Catalonia is annexed by the French Empire aka France. Is it a colony? No because everyone was made French citizen with the same rights and the same duties and the land is turned in departments like in France. They didn't get the same level of services if I may say because the war effort, the lack of ressources  and the lack of time make that most non-French departmement was not always completely reformed. For example, each commune has to get a school for boys and each canton (an administrative level of several communes) a school for girls but it was not the case everywhere.

4. What could have made the kingdom of Spain a French colony? Well several things could have. The most obvious would be to have French settlers exploiting the Spanish land. Then it would be to have the French backed authority if not Napoleon himself implementing a discrimination by giving rights (especially political rights) and freedoms to the french settlers and some local allies and not the rest of the natives who would moslty get duties to fulfill, if the they where not expelled in the first place.

---
As a side note, an interesting specificity of the two French colonial empires is the predominance of colonies of exploitation over the colonies of population (the two kinds of colony in the western colonial empires). France is one if not the most populated country in Europe until Germany unification but has always had troubles to have its population settles overseas. Mostly because unlike Spain, Ireland, Italy, England, France would rarely suffer from starvation or religious persecution during the time of the exploration. It is why today the only former french colony that has French descendants is Canada with Québec and Acadie.

4695,"Lol, I would say it's quite the opposite, they are some of the most corrupt in the world. The differences between corruption in the US and corruption in shitty countries are, mainly:

1. The average income in the US is high enough that most people don't actually feel the impact of corruption in their day to day lives. When you live a reasonably comfortable life, it's easy to not give a shit about politics and the corruption that encompasses it. 

2. The US is a superpower, so it's possible for corrupt politicians and businessmen to enrich themselves by ripping off other countries instead of their own. It's not uncommon to hear about some US company bribing foreign governments to obtain contracts and those companies are more often than not tied to US politicians. Just because you steal more from other people than you steal from your own doesn't make you any less corrupt, if anything, it makes you more corrupt. Politicians in shitty countries, like Romania and Bulgaria, don't have the ability to steal from other countries, so they steal more from their own, which are already poor as fuck, so that's why they *seem* more corrupt than politicians in more powerful countries.

3. Last but not least, is the fact that corruption in the US is much more refined, as it has a history of hundreds of years and even laws designed enable it. In shitty countries corruption is pretty primitive, in the way that it usually involves some shady dude meeting with a politician in some obscure location and giving him a suitcase full of cash. In the US, it's far more advanced, with the bribes being disguised as sponsorships, bearer shares in offshore companies etc. Nevertheless, the result is the same, which is some people enriching themselves at the expense of others.",Romania,/r/europe/comments/7b0pne/a_couple_at_tonights_anticorruption/dpf3nh1/,pulicafranaru,1509963905

If the fund wasn't a consequence of reasonable politics and social culture then Norway would likely be in a similar situation to Venezuela. This doesn't really expand much since I can't really point out which factors are what made Norway so successful at this, but it's a bit of a chicken and the egg situation. Either way, I think Norway would be good at avoiding policies that suppress wages simply because of their culture, not JUST because of the fund (as a reference point those kind of policies are also unpopular in Sweden and Finland, who have no such funds).

4912,"PETERS TOWNSHIP, Pa. — The new Swedish ambassador to the United States was wedged into the back seat of a Honda Civic headed south out of Pittsburgh in search of some true-believing, climate-change-denying, anti-free-trade, “America first” Trump voters.

On one side of Ambassador Karin Olofsdotter sat a former German defense minister and on the other a Washington think-tanker, a former Obama White House official who had organized the Trump country excursion.

Olofsdotter was only a couple of months into her stint as Sweden’s ambassador and still struggling to make sense of a country that seemed as though it had been flipped upside down politically since her last U.S. tour six years ago, when she was the embassy’s second-in-command. From her car window on a late October afternoon, she watched as stately stone houses, built during the steel booms of an earlier era, gave way to the sleepy, well-lit strip malls of Peters Township and the Pittsburgh suburbs.

These were some of the neighborhoods that helped elect President Trump and set off something of a panic on the other side of the Atlantic. For the first time since the end of World War II, European leaders worried whether the United States was willing and capable of leading the West. They fretted over the survival of an American-led order that had generally kept the peace in Europe for more than 70 years and wondered whether Trump and the voters who backed him even knew what they were forsaking.

Many of those fears were summed up this fall in a manifesto written by a dozen former German government officials and foreign policy experts. “German policy now requires something that it did not need before: a U.S. strategy” to manage an increasingly unreliable American president, concluded the essay, published in Die Zeit, a weekly newspaper.

As ambassador, a big part of Olofsdotter’s job is to explain this new America to her fellow Swedes. So when Julie Smith, the think-tanker in the back seat, offered her a chance to talk with Trump voters, Olofsdotter jumped at it. The centerpiece of the two-day visit to western Pennsylvania — and the main attraction for Olofsdotter — was a public discussion at the Peters Township public library, where the Swedish ambassador was promised she would get a chance to meet some typical Americans in a county that had backed Trump with more than 60 percent of the vote.

Much of what Olofsdotter knew about Pittsburgh she had learned from reading its Wikipedia entry on the plane ride from Washington.

“It has 446 bridges,” she said. “Doesn’t that seem a bit odd?”

She picked up some more information in meetings with Pittsburgh leaders and newspaper editors, who described the city’s transformation in recent years from a depressed and dirty manufacturing city into a hub for health-care and technology companies. Wages were rising and unemployment was falling, they told her. The biggest challenge they had was managing growth.

“Do the people who live in the Trump circles work in these high-tech companies?” Olofsdotter asked during her meeting with editors at the Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette.

“It’s a little scary, but a lot of them work in the medical field,” one of the editors replied.

Of Peters Township, where she was currently headed, she knew even less. Olofsdotter gazed out at the well-heeled suburb that was supposed to be home to some of the angry, populist sentiment that had vaulted Trump to the presidency. The sun was setting, the leaves were turning, and the Halloween decorations were out. So far, it didn’t look so angry. 

“Nice asphalt,” Olofsdotter observed of the easy ride over the rolling hills. “Ever since I lived in Russia, I have become an admirer of smooth asphalt.”

The car turned a corner where dozens of simple white crosses had been planted in the ground — an abortion protest that Olofsdotter assumed was part of the town’s Halloween festivities until she was corrected by her American hosts.

“It’s lovely out here,” Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg, the former German defense minister, said.

“Very well kept,” Olofsdotter added.

Soon they came to a stop at the public library, a new, two-story brick building, where the parking lot was full and the librarian was eagerly waiting for them by the front door.

Breaking out of boxes

The idea for the program that took Olofsdotter to Trump country was hatched at the Center for a New American Security (CNAS) in the first weeks after a presidential election that virtually all of Washington’s foreign policy establishment — Republican and Democrat — believed was a total disaster.

On the campaign trail and in office, Trump trashed the alliances that these elites had spent their careers nurturing. “The world is a mess,” Trump said repeatedly, and America’s long-serving foreign policy experts were largely to blame.

Many in that rarefied group of policy thinkers, in turn, wondered how they had fallen so far out of touch with the country they were supposed to be serving.

Last December, Smith, a senior fellow at CNAS, decided it was time for her to reconnect with America. She found a willing partner in the German government, which offered her money to fund a program that would send current and former European officials out into Trump’s America.

“I want to come back with better insights into how we can talk about foreign policy with the general public,” Smith said. “I want to hear their legitimate grievances.”

She sketched out a plan to visit 12 cities over three years.

Her first stop: western Pennsylvania.

Her first big problem: finding some aggrieved Trump supporters who were willing to make time for a discussion. Seven of the eight local Republican district chairman said they were too busy. The local conservative radio station didn’t return her calls. A Christian radio station initially agreed to have Smith and her European guests on, but canceled a few hours before they arrived in Pittsburgh.

“This is so much harder than I realized,” she complained. “Shoot me now.”

That left the Peters Township public library as their best chance for a real conversation with people who might disagree with them. The librarian escorted the three guests past the young adult fiction section, the “lucky day” shelf and a table full of lemonade and cookies decorated with sprinkles in the colors of the Swedish and German flags.

“Do Trump voters go to libraries?” one of Smith’s former Obama administration colleagues, now a University of Pittsburgh professor, had asked her the previous day.

About 120 people were waiting for the program to start — a big crowd for a Thursday. There were about 30 Advanced Placement government and world history students from the local high school; they had been promised extra credit for attending. The rest of the audience consisted of older men and women in khakis, jeans and comfortable shoes. Two policemen lingered attentively by the front desk in case there was any trouble.

“A lot of think-tankers and government officials where I am from sit around and talk to each other,” Smith said, kicking things off. “After a while, you realize you are having the same conversations all the time with the same people.”

She looked up at the crowd, which filled the library’s main atrium and a second-floor balcony, and braced for a blast of frustration, anger and hopefully insight of the sort that she wasn’t hearing in Washington.

“What we don’t do is talk to people like you,” she said.

Is it safe to travel to Sweden?
The two Europeans — Olofsdotter and Guttenberg — spent much of the next 90 minutes answering questions from a crowd that was far more curious than angry.

An Army veteran who had served in Europe asked whether NATO could survive without the United States.

“No,” answered Guttenberg, the former defense minister.

A high school student asked Olofsdotter about a proposed U.S.-European Union trade deal that died in the run-up to last year’s presidential election. Several of the older attendees wondered about the influx of Middle Eastern refugees, their impact on European culture and the recent rise of far-right parties.

Olofsdotter suggested that job-killing robots, not asylum seekers, were the real driver of anxiety on both sides of the Atlantic. This was her fourth time living in the United States. She first spent a year in Egg Harbor Township, N.J., outside Atlantic City, as a high school exchange student in the 1980s. She spent another year as a graduate student at UCLA.

But it was two diplomatic tours — six years ago and today — that drove home to Olofsdotter the confounding nature of the United States and its politics.

In October, she attended Trump’s speech on tax reform at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative Washington think tank. The crowd was almost entirely white, a change from the presidential speeches of her previous tour. The event began with an opening prayer, something that hardly ever occurs in Europe and that she didn’t recall from her earlier stint in Washington. Midway through the post-speech dinner, one of her table mates asked her if it was still safe to travel in Sweden — a remark likely prompted by the president’s suggestion in February that an influx of asylum seekers had triggered a crime wave in the country.

“We’ve got to keep our country safe,” Trump told supporters. “You look at what’s happening in Germany, you look at what’s happening last night in Sweden.”

The remarks were met with ridicule in Sweden and concern at the embassy, which earlier this year commissioned a poll of American attitudes toward the country.

Peters Township offered Olofsdotter the kind of complex snapshot that a poll couldn’t provide. After the discussion, she grabbed a cookie and mingled with the audience. 

“I’m 37 percent Swedish, according to my DNA,” one man said by way of introduction.

A retired ophthalmologist asked her if she was worried that native Swedes were going to be “out-reproduced” by Muslim immigrants and asylum seekers. Swedes were reproducing just fine, she politely replied.

A former schoolteacher pressed her on Russian aggression in the Baltic Sea.

“Every day there is uneasiness,” she said.

At the hotel bar after the speech, Olofsdotter, Smith and Guttenberg tried to guess the percentage of Trump voters in the audience.

“I saw a few grumpy faces,” Guttenberg said.

“No hecklers,” Smith replied.

The discussion turned to particular audience members. The man who had introduced himself to Guttenberg by apologizing for “that idiot who is our president” definitely wasn’t a Trump voter. The ophthalmologist, they guessed, probably backed the president.

What about the librarian who had arranged for the cookies? She could go either way, the three concluded.

‘Another entangling alliance’
The next day Olofsdotter headed to the University of Pittsburgh to meet with some international affairs students, and Smith went to talk with the sole local Republican official who had agreed to make time for her.

Decades earlier, Andy Dlinn had served as a Navy officer and, like Smith, had worked in the office of the defense secretary in the Pentagon. Now he was a financial planner, a member of the ultra-conservative John Birch Society and the Republican chairman for Pittsburgh’s 5th Council District.

“When I say Europe, what comes to mind?” Smith asked.

“It’s another entangling alliance,” Dlinn replied. “It detracts from our sovereignty.”

Soon their talk turned to the threats posed by immigration, refugees and the set of rules governing Islam, known as sharia law. “There are places right now in Detroit and also North Carolina — I am trying to remember the name of the city — where police can’t go because sharia runs the place,” Dlinn said.

“Okay,” Smith replied warily.

“I’ll give you another example,” Dlinn said. “It’s not Muslim. It’s Hispanic.” The National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic advocacy group, was trying to form a breakaway state, stretching from California to Louisiana, he said. He described the Council on Foreign Relations as a “shadow government,” working secretly to impose its globalist, one-world-government vision on an unsuspecting America.

“Well, listen, this is terrific,” Smith said, gently ending the chat. “This is why we came to Pittsburgh.”

She headed toward the airport, still unsure what to make of her final meeting.

“That delivered in spades,” she said as she climbed into her Uber.

“But it can wear you down,” she added a few minutes later as the car raced through traffic.

To Olofsdotter, who was waiting for her at the gate, Smith said simply: “I wish you had heard it. It was out there, but it was important.”

Olofsdotter wondered if Dlinn had always harbored such extreme thoughts or had come to them more recently.

“That’s what I wanted to know,” replied Smith, who was now wishing she had asked.

“Maybe it’s a rude or arrogant question,” Olofsdotter replied.

On the flight home, Smith was still thinking about Dlinn and the next stops on her tour. “How do you engage someone like that?” she asked. “I don’t have the answers after one trip. I might not have them after 12 trips.”

Olofsdotter was wrestling with her own questions from the visit. On one point, she was certain: “The United States is an amazing, frustrating place.”",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/7b2rqn/the_swedish_ambassadors_searches_for_answers_in/dpetbbc/,SeuthesII,1509941730

4918,"You need a better adblocker mate.

&gt; European Union negotiators have started drawing up the outlines of a future trade deal with Britain after receiving signals from the government that it would agree to pay more than €60bn (£53bn) for the “Brexit bill”.

Negotiators in Brussels say Theresa May will be able to claim a victory before Christmas as trade talks get going — but made clear the prime minister has used officials to signal financial concessions.

May’s Brexit adviser, Oliver Robbins, was told last week that EU officials need to see only a “single sentence” in writing to indicate Britain’s acceptance of budget commitments known as reste à liquider (RAL) and the UK’s share of the cost of MEP pensions and aid budgets.

May has already offered to pay €20bn during a two-year transition period. The EU estimates the UK owes €32bn more in RAL and a further €10bn for other liabilities. This would bring the total to some €62bn. The final sum would not be thrashed out until the end of the talks.

“If they [the UK government] are smart, they will use this to claim victory and say trade talks have finally started,” said a senior EU negotiator, adding that “internal preparatory work” on the trade deal was already under way and would accelerate ahead of the December summit.

A senior government source said the Brexit bill would be a small price to pay for a better trade deal. “The value of getting a smoother process of transition and a smoother process of trade in the end game is worth quite a lot. These are sums that make any lubrication of the process look like small change.”

You can have two administrative areas (or 2 digit postcode as it's called there) both showing the same low density. One has an evenly spread out rural population while the other has one large, prosperous city and then an empty wilderness. The first would be truly low density in terms of potential consumption while the second would be more appealing since all the potential consumers are concentrated in one place.  
  
Furthermore, how the boundaries of those areas are defined changes the results considerably, while the underlying reality is the same. Using the example from above, if the town and uninhabited wilderness were separated into two postcode areas, the city might become a small speck of red on the map while the wilderness would remain blue. Polygon maps based on administrative borders are bad in this regard (though easy to produce).  
  
Finally, how the break values of the color scales are defined can significantly change the perception of the map. The 3-color scale exaggerates this because the blue and red colors really jump out. Minor tweaks in the break values can significantly change the spread of red and blue, leading to a different perception, even though the rough outline will be similar.",Iceland,/r/europe/comments/7axrhm/purchasing_power_density_in_europe_2016/dpemti8/,harassercat,1509933816

They were jailed because they were key-figures in the pro-independence movement. That's why they are considered political prisoners. Good luck finding a jurist in Spain that thinks they deserve to be in prison.

They were judged by a Court with no competence (Barcelona Courts are competent), for a crime they didn't commit (sedition), receiving an injunction the Spanish Criminal Law doesn't permit to apply in these cases (provisional prison).

I'm gonna answer for you.

About ""*the Minister that is at home with this family*"". You didn't want to say his name, why is that? Because you know he's a clear example about why this is a political trial. His name = Minister Santi Vila.

You can read the Court order about Santi Vila [here](https://twitter.com/FonsiLoaiza/status/926411947234529280). Since Santi Vila resigned the day after the declaration of independence, because he didn't agree with it, the Spanish judge didn't order prison for him. Whereas all the other Minsiters that stayed and took part at the UDI, are now in jail.

What does it mean? This means the reason they are in jail is because they declared independence. Now, is there a crime in Spanish Criminal Code about it? ""*Declaring independence entitles a prison punishment*"". The answer is a clear NO. Declaring independence is not a crime. And declaring independence is clearly not rebellion nor sedition, which are the 2 crimes the judge used to justify prison. The Spanish Lawmaker himself who wrote the rebellion crime at Spanish Criminal Code, said rebellion crime CAN NOT be applied to this situation: Catalan Ministers declaring independence.

Santi Vila is a perfect proof the Ministers are jailed for their ideas, since they haven't committed any crime, and the only difference is supporting or not supporting UDI.

A scientist wouldn't be so absurdly stupid as to quote something that says 'questionable quality' and then state that that means it is fake.

SCIRP are well known for two reasons:

1) They spam academics trying to get decent papers to fill out their innumerable 'journals'

2) They'll publish pretty much anything regardless of quality if you'll pay a 'fee'.


Nothing in those two things suggests fake, just mercenary and with crappy standards.

I suppose his [published book](https://www.casadellibro.com/libro-la-pasion-secesionista/9788461772186/4865862) on the same subject is fake.

5121,"&gt; It surprises me even more that attempt against the State's integrity isn't more covered by the laws, either penal or organic.

I believe this is a comment misunderstanding. ""Territorial integrity"" is an International Law principle that applies between states. But according to ICJ resolutions, it can't be applied to internal entities. 

In that case, Catalonia declaring independence wouldn't be a violation of Spain's territorial integrity. On the other hand, if France invaded Spain to help Catalonia become independent, then it would be an attack against Spain's territorial integrity.

----

If you mean why declaring independence is not more covered by the laws... usually this type of laws were common during previous centuries (as it happened during Francoist Spain), but they don't seem to make many sense in 21st century Europe. If a group of people want to become independent, jailing their politicians is not a solution to this problem. Political problems demand political resolutions.

This is why the 1995 Spanish lawmaker (he explains it himself), included ""violence"" as a requisite for the rebellion crime. This was a way to protect the people that wanted to defend self-determination and independence in Spain (basically Basques and Catalans), without the threat of prison for defending it.",Catalonia,/r/europe/comments/7atvj9/owen_jones_the_guardian_journalist_at_the_bbc/dpegz7h/,Gerardpb2,1509926921

&gt;David Harland, the former head of UN Civil Affairs in Bosnia, claimed at the trial of General Dragomir Milošević in ICTY, that he was responsible for the creation of the myth that UNPROFOR was unable to determine who had fired the mortar shells that caused the second Markale massacre. The myth that has survived for more than ten years, Harland said, was created because of a “neutral statement” made by General Rupert Smith, the UNPROFOR commander. On the day of the second Markale attack, General Smith stated “it is unclear who fired the shells, although at that time he already had the technical report of UNPROFOR intelligence section, determining beyond reasonable doubt that they were fired from VRS positions at Lukavica”. Harland himself had advised General Smith to make “a neutral statement in order not to alarm the Serbs who would be alerted to the impending NATO air strikes against their positions had he pointed a finger at them”, which would have jeopardized the safety of UN troops in the territory under VRS control or on positions where they might have been vulnerable to retaliatory attacks by Serb forces

5) Who's this woman? Definitely not a politician. But it's actually true that Franco tried to supress Catalan identity by moving there people from other parts of Spain. But he couldn't, precisely because these people were far more respectful to the local culture than the Francoists.

Not even 3 weeks after the ""Nationalratswahl"" (National Council election), one of the candidates, Peter Pilz, stepped back after being accused of sexual assaulting woman in 2 cases.

He was once part of ""Die Grünen"" (a left wing party), but split his ways with them shortly before the election. His own ""party"" now got &gt;5%, while ""Die Grünen"" only got 3.8%.

For instance the British only made real headway against the Ottomans in the Levant in 1917, and Italy only managed to overcome Austria with heavy allied support in 1918.

On purely military terms 1917 was a decent starting point for the Russians; the front with the Austrians and Germans had stabilized after the Great Retreat, allied supplies were coming through in decent numbers, and the Russians had seized most of Turkish Armenia and still held parts of Austrian Galicia. iirc Churchill referred to it as sinking within sight of port.

5299,"I'm not an economist or anything but from googling around and looking into it a bit I found out that one way to calculate the GDP of a country is:

Consumption(goods and services) + Investment + Government spending + (Exports - Imports)

This is the total GDP (gross domestic product) of the country, to get the nominal GDP per capita you divide this by the total population of the country.

In terms of nominal GDP per capita in US dollars, Romania is still behind Turkey and Croatia, as you can see [here](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD?locations=RO-TR-HR).

But GDP is supposed to be a measure of production. Let's say we have 2 countries, if for example goods and/or services are way cheaper in one country than in another, comparing nominal GDP is not really useful to see how much is produced in a country, which is why PPP (purchasing power parity) exists, basically it adjusts prices of goods and services (makes them equal to the ones in the USA, which is why they are the only country where nominal and PPP gdp are the same).

After you adjust for the prices of goods and services in different countries, then you can accurately compare how much they produce.

Adjusted for PPP, the gdp per capita in Romania, Croatia and Turkey [were pretty much the same in 2016](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.PP.CD?locations=RO-TR-HR).",Romania,/r/europe/comments/7axnvy/year_when_gdp_per_capita_of_15000_was_surpassed/dpeb9rq/,bobama123,1509920563

Where did you read that in my post? Never ever crossed my mind, it's bullshit.

What did cross my mind is that Croatia and Slovenia developed in Yugoslavia because they had a large internal market (23.5 million people) where they sold their products for years, protected with high custom taxes against foreign competition. And thanks to the Yugoslavia's role in the non-allied movement they had access to the international markets they cannot dream of today. Not to mention acting as a proxy for western companies on eastern markets (Pliva for Ciba-Geigy for example.) My conclusion is that from the economical point of view, the break up of Yugoslavia was stupid and that the motives were others. And the past 25 years did nothing to make me change my mind.

Well about the last part ,I dont care if they say Alexander was Macedonian maybe he was i havent searched it.But what does it matter?
The man had greek teachers,he spoke greek he united the greeks and he spread the greak civiliazation not the macedonian so in the end he chose to be greek so why build monuments for him? He didnt fight for Macedonia,so i dont understand what we ""stole"".
Look maybe you think we are over dramatic but for a country that lost half of one of its most important islands forty years ago from one neighbour and then sees its northern neighbour claiming a part of its lands too well....lets say it is a big deal for us.Add to that albania  triying to take lands from the greek minority that lives there,Turkey claiming that we still have some of their islands.......not a very pleasant situation really.

What a session. For our allies. Or, if you ask our other allies, our enemies. And enemies' allies. Our diplomacy was complicated for the last 3 weeks.

Anyhow, we took control of most of Denmark, getting all the islands (including bloody Sjaelland this time), and we now control most of the Lubeck node, raking in all the $$$$$.

While we were integrating Danes into our nation, Europe was burning yet again, don't know much about all that since all I did was feed Lubeckian trade money to members of the great Carolingian Alliance, also known as the Insult Squad.

18 provinces with ~260 dev, and a shit ton of trade money, dev pushed Colonialism to bring it to Europe quicker since it spawned in Asia.

The ""small"" difference is that Otegi was an ETA member, and that has been proved in court. He also openly supported ETA, too.

On the other hand, González has always denied his involvement in GAL operations and we only have theories and suspicions.

Now, you are the guy who's treating dubious claims as if they were facts, with the difference that for my argument they were accesory but they are key on yours. Who's judging now?

But more importantly, PSOE as a political party has **never** showed support for GAL. Far from it. Also current PSOE MP Margarita Robles was key on the investigation for finding the corpses of Lasa&amp;Zabala, while Otegi appointed Josu Ternera for the human rights comission in the Basque Parliament.

No he wasn't. Even if he was the first, he himself said that 2/3 of his dictionary is copied from already existing Croatian dictionaries, making Vuk Karadžić proof of nothing. 

But all that is irrelevant because the word is not first recorded by Vuk Karadžić (in 19th century).

Gibanica was recorded by Jakov Mikalja in his dictionary Blago jezika slovinskoga published in 1651. (2 centuries before Vuk). There he compares it to similar dish *prisnac* (typical for Dalmatia). Petar Skok in his etymological dictionary says the word was attested in Croatian in 17th century, and describes it as *»Kuchen aus Mehl, Eiern und Käse«*.

He also notes that the name for dish was borrowed into [Friulian language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friulian_language) as *gubana*, *bubana* or *gubanize*. U insted of i points to that that it was borrowed when old phoneme called [jery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_central_unrounded_vowel) was still pronounced as such (later y gave i) - and that was way way before 18th century. Friulians certainly didn't come all the way to Serbia to hear of the dish and see how it was made.

Skok also notes that the dish is a characteristic of **South Slavic cuisine** and was made (still is) by people from Bulgaria to Slovenia.

5514,"&gt;&gt; It seems like it's an area where the uk has quite a strong hand, not least because ireland is completely surrounded by uk airspace.

&gt; Is it ? I am not sure - the UK and Ireland share an air space block

That's kind of impossible because you can't have more than one authority (and thus responsibility) for any given region of space.  That's not to say that ATCOs from different FIRs don't work together, of course they do, but principal authority is the controller of the FIR in which the a/c is presently located.

Airspaces are divided vertically into FIRs (Flight Information Regions).  See [ICAO's FIR map](http://gis.icao.int/icaoviewernew/#/) and horizontally into different classes of airspace.  See See [NATS' description of how both work](https://www.nats.aero/ae-home/introduction-to-airspace/).

As a practical matter, commercial aviation is all but limited to non-class G airspace (unregulated, own recognisance) because they are (nominally) always [IFR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrument_flight_rules) and therefore under constant ATC supervision and must file flight plans with the relevant authorit(ies).  There are exceptions, but not many, and (I imagine) especially not for pax-carrying a/c.

Cruise altitude is typically Class A, the strictest of airspace rules, so even a/c merely transiting through sovereign or international airspace are subject to the ATC under the authority of that FIR, even if it's technically international airspace.

&gt; - but at least In the western coast of Ireland does not have any British airspace blocking an approach to the country as far as I know.

Shanwick Oceanic FIR to EI's west is UK airspace, or responsibility for it is delegated to the UK by ICAO.  You can see it simplest in the NATS link above, but also in more detail in the FIR map.

Shanwick is westward bounded by longitude 30°W (half way across the Atlantic, where it meets Canada's Gander FIR) and latitudes 45°N to 61°N covering, quoting NATS, some 700,000 square miles of airspace.  It completely encloses Ireland to the west.

&gt; Flights would take much longer then now - but it would not be cut off.

For everywhere other than Ireland, that's true.  But even in Ireland and the UK, non-UK/non-EU carriers and pilots will continue to be able to operate so it'll be business as usual for US and other carriers.  Too bad they won't be able to connect with EU carriers at Heathrow, however (assuming CAA/EASA reciprocity turns into a big row and UK-EU pilots and a/c are forbidden from each other's airspaces). 

There's a good chance that, even absent a formal agreement between the UK and EU, the CAA and EASA will work something out between them, if they are legally able to do so — at least with respect to transiting a/c ie, the First Freedom, in which case most of this is moot.  

UK/EU segments by EU/UK operators may be interrupted until formal arrangements can be put into place, but that will probably be done swiftly because it's in nobody's interests to fool about with this stuff.

&gt; But I think the interesting questions are not in the first 2 freedoms of airtransport. It will start with 3/4.

It's not a problem of the Freedoms under Chicago because there are sufficient non-EU, bilateral ASAs in force (according to ICAO) that should allow for continued operation on *legal* grounds (with most parts of the EU, anyway; ex-communist member states might not have such ASAs in place because Maastricht was concluded only just after the fall of the USSR); the problem is whether there will be sufficient reciprocal recognition (CAA/EASA) of pilot licencing and a/c certifications to allow them to exercise those legal rights in a manner satisfactory to ATC and, just as importantly, insurers.

As u/mrsuaveoi3 mentioned, cabotage rights (Freedoms 8 &amp; 9) will almost certainly disappear which will be a problem for low cost and short-haul airlines, but probably less of a problem for scheduled flagship carriers.

&gt; London is a major hub for transatlantic travel at the moment.

Notably code-shares, which requires that EU and non-EU operators can both get into EGLL.

&gt; What if the EU does not allow that BA / AA / AC and so on sells tickets with connections from the EU via London to the US.

The EU can't legally interfere with those bilateral ASAs because they are agreements between sovereign states and, so far as I know, ASAs are not a competence that the TEU obliges member states to surrender to Brussels.  They can't be, because the relations between different member states and various non-EU countries is too variable and too dependent on other matters for that to work.  Trade's hard enough — and where you don't *need* an agreement to trade, you *do* need an agreement to operate commercial air services between given countries.

The UK is a founder-member of Eurocontrol (ATC, flight plans, routing etc) in its own right since 1960, so our leaving the EU should not affect any of that where our leaving the EU will also mean leaving EASA.

Therefore, if there is any problem, I predict it'll revolve around UK CAA/EASA reciprocity.

&gt; Or denies codeshares which need government approval.

Do they?  I'd have thought code-shares were strictly commercial arrangements.

&gt; Or only allows less flights from London to EU Markets so that London as a transatlantic hub becomes less interesting due to connecting times / availability of flights.

I can't see how the EU can interfere in that manner.  It'll have to be 'all or nothing' based on safety or regulatory matters.  Either an airline is safe or not, either UK pilots' ATPLs are valid in the EU or not.

&gt; And then there are the airlines which have a British / EU AOC - will They be allowed to fly as usual ?

Yes, provided EASA recognises the UK CAA's competence to issue AOCs, licences and similar.  If not, then that's when UK operators and pilots will get banned from EU airspace and vice versa, but non-EU, non-UK carriers and pilots will continue business as usual.

Can you see the EU tolerating that state of affairs for long, putting its own carries at competitive disadvantage to foreign carriers?

&gt; Easyjet moved to Vienna for this reason. Ryanair which does have an EU AOC has 3 of its biggest bases in the UK - which it might not be allowed to service then.

Both are possibilities, though I don't know why if Hungarian Wizz Air can apply for a UK AOC why RYR can't.

&gt; So all in all - it gets damn complicated.

Yup.

Being pro EU does not matter because they are now a separate entity they and would need to renegotiate their membership with ALL EU member countries as EVERY other country had to NO exceptions. Not just that there is a lot of things that would need to be done first resettling their debts, providing provisions for almost half the population which want's to be part of Spain. The uncertainty of the situation, no transition period, no plans or provisions for people, economy or industry. They would face a pretty massive hit to their economy and industry which would directly impact not just Spain but entire EU especially parts which have larger trade/service volume with Catalonia.  

They would most likely have to reapply for EURO unless EU granted them some kind of special status but there is no way for this in EU law except the official way of adoption which would take some time. They would need to renegotiate their relations with all countries, establish embassy network, for the duration they are not in EU they would revert to WTO agreement which would mean high tariffs for any import/export.  

And after all that they would need a YES vote from Spain. Does not matter if they settle all the matters, without Spain saying YES they cannot join EU and good luck with that.

Religion has no place in our modern society but I will not let someone say Christianity is a religion that thinks poor people deserve it. The exact opposite is true and anyone stating otherwise is doing to Christianity what Isis does to Islam. Bending the words to push an agenda.

Extremely religious christians that follow the Bible by heart are often hardcore anti capitalist as they see that everything in the world that goes against their religion is caused by capitalism. They perceive capitalism as an enemy but for different reasons than I do.

5690,"I was too unclear about nationalities maybe. I will not go to deep into it now but I tried to show the exact opposite of what you are saying I said. In short: defining Catalonia or Brittanny as nations would be arbitrary as every other nation. Saying Catalonia is Catalonia because of a natural catalan ethnicity is not rellay precise. Apparently then I was unclear. As you noted, I am not an english native speaker. I advise you to restrain yourself from arguing against people based on their nationalities too. You know nothing about me and you have no bloody idea what is going on with my nationality exept of a flair. If I were you, I would not even go into that territory. You also did that with pole before. You will probably also agree with the notion: ""Not all germans today are nazis"", don't you? So do not suppose stuff based on a flair, would you?




Again: a british person living in GB is mostly concerned about his home being invaded/bombed. At the end of the war, that applied certainly to germans. But not in september 1939 when germany started a horrendous war of aggression. So the idea of resistance is not quite the same, you see? Now it is true that this should apply to the Soviet Union at that point too. Also, when I meant opposition, I really meant when it was still possible and in some cases even done. By that I mean in the first years of the regime, where a euthanasia program was stopped by the fear of the nazi government of popular reject. So resistance was absolutly possible at the beginning. Of course, in 1943, it was another story.



What I try to point out is that it is not the kill count that matters (germans have the lead anyway), but the modus operandi that makes Nazi germany a, although morbidly fascinating, testimony to how low a human being can fall and what happens when all bestiality is set loose to the point of organised, societal bestiality (in the form of the persecution of jews). So in a way, yes, the red army soldier raping and murdering german civilians is a criminal as is a german soldier doing the same and a french soldier as well.



But the very unique dynamic that allowed in a matter of two decades to create such a monstrous society and mindset should be watched closely and not be thrown into a global definition of ""it was just horrible war, as did the allies"". Because no, a drunk amercian soldier shooting an old german in 1945 is not the same as the Einsatzgruppen.


I have also nothing against conservatism. I have indeed something about militant nationalism, obsessession by the purity of the nation (even if concern is the beginning), combined with a vision of the decline, decadence or corruption of his nation mixed with violence and reject of democratic principles. Right wing hate? Not in general. But going into TV and saying you are proud of yur lutheran past is not the same as going, like the AFD does, and bringing out the clean Wehrmacht myth. 



What I mean is: analising exactly WHAT happened is ok. Throwing all of those crimes into the same sack saying ""it was all the same crimes, everyone was bad etc."" is quite frankly, dangerous as it allows a certain dicourse that derives often into revisionism and fascism (and I am not saying it is the same, idk where did you take that from).

5734,"&gt; Did this not get any coverage in Poland?  

Please see this [article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_Constitutional_Court_crisis,_2015) - IMHO it's less biased and trying to describe both sides.  


&gt;The Polish Constitutional Court crisis of 2015 is a political conflict which began in Poland in October 2015 with the appointment of five Constitutional Tribunal judges by the Civic Platform (Platforma Obywatelska, PO) party. These included the replacement of three judges whose terms were not due to expire until after first possible date of meeting of the new parliament and two judges whose terms were not due to expire until after last possible date of meeting of the new parliament. According to Polish law, judges of the Constitutional Tribunal are to be elected by the parliament which is sitting when the terms of the previous judges expire.[1] Civic Platform was predicted to lose the upcoming elections. After the Law and Justice (Prawo i Sprawiedliwość, PiS) party won the parliamentary election, it made its own appointments to the court, arguing that the previous appointments of the five judges by PO were unconstitutional. In December, PiS changed the court's decision-making power by prescribing a two-thirds majority vote and mandatory participation of at least 13 of the 15 judges on the Constitutional Tribunal.   

&gt; the comparison of these two policies is inadequate.

 - Lawyers:  yes.  Most will twist and turn on 100 way to justify whatever opinion pays their salary (no matter if it's right or wrong)

 - Unity/ independence in the world: others should not judge regions which they have no understanding of.  Catalunia has 95 years of history with independence, so it is hardly something Puigdemont recently made up. 

Starting 2006 Spain began taking a harder stance against this, limiting, taking away and banning more and more.....  And all it did was gain more support for independence! 

 - independence means Belgium is a country, and not ""south Holland"",    
 - - ...the USA is no longer under control of the UK, ...Australia,  ...Or all the countries that used to be a part of the USSR! 

 - independence should not be considered a bad thing.   BUT...  A lot of times,  they can be based on hollow words, feeling, and little to no planning!

In Catalunya,  you see a lot of support for independence, but not a lot of plans and thoughts about a viable support system to take over. 

(not entirely the same situation) but take BREXIT. For decades,  the UK wanted to get out from under the ""oppressive control of the EU""  and people like Farage had their entire career fighting for this independence! 

You would think they had a wealth of plans and time to think about what they wanted exactly..
... But today, more than a year after BREXIT, hardly any constructive plans are made on how to use this new and precious independence.

It's worse than that. Norway generates all its own electricity from hydro. Scotland is home to wind farms that are subsidised by UK bill payers, and relies on importing fossil fuel electricity from the rest of the UK when wind speeds are low. 

And the headline is actually wrong. Scotland is on target for generating as much renewable electricity as its total electricity consumption. It will still use a lot of oil for transport, gas for heating etc. In fact, the target is for 30% of Scottish energy to come from renewables by 2020, and they will probably meet that.

I agree there has to be a plan after the exit out of house. If you think you can do it better there's a whole lot of the old you should keep adopted. But you should also be willing to put the hands out of the sleeves when you left that 'house' 

I think Catalonia (or is it Catalunya, geesh excuse me) has a track record of wanting to be independent and that because of the determination they had will do a great deal of good once to go independent. Going independent and reshifting borders doesn't necessarily mean it's bad. Not even 70 years ago this happened through war. Nowadays it happens through word conflicts on reddit forums. YUCK! 

I think we have to progress faster because time won't wait anymore and i'm inpatient to. This time we should be able to shift borders like we are already doing when we move individually and we should be able to do it without being held back whenever we have the after exit plans in hands. I do think this is a necessity before a world union should let a part of the world go independent. Peace and a pact of neutrality should be on that list of necessities.

5878,"The pay gap is not a myth. What some people get confused about is that there is a much bigger pay gap if you don't take into account things like the type of job and hours worked. There is still a pay gap if you take into account such factors. 

Actually the thing I hear feminists ""parroting about"" much more is people in positions of power (no, not just politicians). I really hope you're not going to try and say that one is false too. 

&gt; trivialization of violence v them, same as with sexual assault.

It's interesting that you would pick this, because the rates of sexual assault are famously much higher for women, and that is a metric too. 

&gt; suicide rate

Here's another metric: women actually attempt suicide more. 

Men just happen to be more successful at it, apparently because they care less about how they are found (finding someone who has killed themselves in a violent manner is definitely more traumatic than finding someone who has killed themselves in a way that preserves the body, but violent killing is also more effective.)

&gt; public funding for similar health issues,

Funding for specifically or mostly female health issues on the other hand is usually fairly low. A lot of health issues that mostly affect women - these are sometimes thought to be autoimmune related, because autoimmune issues affect women more - tend to get very little research, we don't even tend to know what really causes them, let alone have a proper treatment/cure. 

Also somewhat related, medical research is usually carried out on men, and we know that women have a different metabolism (and other factors affecting medical outcomes), meaning that treatment is usually finetuned for men rather than women. A woman will be prescribed the same pills - in the same dosage - as a man, even though we already know this is probably not right. 

&gt; Honestly hard pressed to find a statistic in which men are advantaged by society/government over women

I just find this sad to be honest. I am not the type of person to say women are always treated worse, or to see sexism in every little thing, and I definitely think men are disadvantaged in some ways but... to be so convinced that women aren't disadvantaged in other ways too... Jeez.

5969,"I personally think local food isn't special in North-Western Europe and Scandinavia. Only the local fast food and snacks might be interesting.

If I were you I'd focus on trying out the different minority cultures. e.g. in Rotterdam you have a big population of Turks, Surinamese, Chinese, Indonesians, Antileans, Moroccans and Cape Verdians and a growing population of Syrians and Eritreans. Each of these minorities have their unique kitchen and at least one good restaurant. An example is Restaurant Safir (Moroccan) - simply amazing. Or go to the West-Kruiskade for many great Chinese restaurants, but also Uyghur (not that good tho very special), Vietnamese and Japanese. There's a new ramen restaurant there ('Takumi Düsseldorf), the Chinese restaurants are all great (including a hotpot restaurant) and the Vietnamese is okay, somewhat fastfood-ish but still good for variation.

Also, right next to Blaak you have a street with good restaurants too (streets Botersloot and Nieuwemarkt): an Apulian (Italian) restaurant specializing in Apulian street food, a Korean restaurant, and some more Italian/healthy/Chinese/etc. The Witte de withstraat is also recommended. 


For the more Dutch gems in Rotterdam I can suggest:
- Dudok for dessert. Dudok Apple Pie is popular and can be found in many restaurants across Rotterdam. 
- Markthal: Kroketkraam, Peanut Butter bar, Cheese shops, plenty of local and international food. Good for snacks and for lunch. 
- Bazar: slight focus on Turkish food but very popupar with me and my friends.
- Uit Je Eigen Stad: for dinner you can go to the Uit Je Eigen Stad next to Marconiplein. It's a restaurant where all ingredients are made in Rotterdam, mostly next to the restaurant: they grow their own groceries and farm animals.
- Pannenkoekenrestaurants: pancake restaurants. There's some of them. Simply try it! They're all good. 
- Fenix Food Factory: the 'hip' place in Rotterdam for food. Lacks the variation of the Markthal but it's way more cosy and ambient. You can just walk through this place and see if you see anything interesting
- Hotel New York: popular for lunch, slightly expensive. Right next to the Fenix Food Factory.",,/r/europe/comments/7auvfz/long_story_short_i_inherited_some_money_and_will/dpdd4en/,Luc3121,1509870630

That's pretty much what happened, isn't it? I don't think ideology had much influence on who Finland fought. There were plenty of fascists in Finland, and also plenty of communists.

The closest thing we have to Carrefour in Austria is Merkur, a Rewe owned super market chain and some huge SPARs. Bot those are mostly still only half as big as the typical Hypermarche.
