1,"But they aren't following Scandinavian policies. In Scandinavian socialism you have decent state-paid healthcare, free kindergartens, or something like that. Here you have just throwing money to people who would like to vote for them.

For example, around 2 years ago there were massive young doctors protests. They wanted healthcare system reform, one of point of that reform was to put there more money (because, well, with spending around 4,8% of GDP they're underfunded). What did they do? Of course they focused on money only. They used state propaganda machine to blame the protestors. They were constantly showing two photos on TV, one was women on scholarship eating sandwich with caviar (you see, caviar, they have to be rich!) and second was young doctor in the Middle East (they can afford expensive holidays!), but they didn't say that she was volunteer on humanitarian action. In the end, they agreed to „some degree” with that doctor association, but after that they fooled them and used creative accounting. All of that because they wouldn't vote for them, so why to give them money?

500+ policy (currently about \~120 euro benefit for third and next child) were introduced as a measure to rise birth rate. But after a couple of months, years it showed up that it had little to no impact on that indicator. Well, about state budget and amount of their voters – quite opposite.

Not to mention that Poland isn't Norway, there's no oil here.

Although I am not a fan of socialism, that's worse – they aren't enacting their policies to actually mitigate some problems. That's just populism.",,/r/europe/comments/hfj0d8/poland_wiadomości_state_tv_evening_news_publish_a/fw1ub9f/,shinylakes,1593169148

6,"&gt;I completely agree but bringing up MGM in every single post about FGM doesn't help in that topic.

Well, the thing is that FGM naturally also makes people think of MGM because both involve cutting up/off parts of the genitalia of babies or children. It is very common that people signal that there are other related problems if one part of a problem is noticed. 

Stating that MGM can not be brought up ever when people talk about FGM because FGM is just much worse is a bit like claiming that rampant racism by cops in the USA against black women cannot be brought up if the subject is yet another black man getting killed by police. Because according to the same type of oppression-stack logic racism against black women in the USA is not so bad because they don't get killed very often.

For example, in ancient Rome/Greece/Egypt (for example) slaves could have their own property (money, clothes, items), they could buy their own freedom, their children were not slaves and they (sometimes) had free time to do other things. There was an incentive to educate your slaves as they become more valuable that way.

Not that the roman system wasn't brutal (it was), but it is a completely different system than the modern slave trade, where slaves were treated more like animals which you would literally breed and it is completely impossible for them to ever be free (which is also related to the racial part).",,/r/europe/comments/hg155x/how_unique_are_british_attitudes_to_empire/fw1ubr1/,mechanical_fan,1593169160

37,"&gt; It's like when stuff like ""black lives matter"" comes up and people respond with ""all lives matter"" or even worse ""white lives matter"". Yeah all lives matter, but that's not the point of those protests or in that case this article. FGM is a serious topic that needs to be looked at directly. Around 8 million women suffered from FGM type 3 which is even just cruel to think about, and it's still happening.
&gt; 
&gt; These woman and girls are a minority that can't fight against systematic suppression and mutilation. Imagine the thing that happened to that guy and how traumatic it was.
&gt; 
&gt; Now Imagine a young girl not only get's cut of most parts of her vagina they also stitch her up and leave it that way until a man can open it after the wedding... The traumata doesn't end in that case. You fear anything that has to do with that part of your body. And you get constantly reminded about that thing that happened to you. You fear love after something like that has happened to you, since it could open ""that wound"".

You're again arguing about the degree and how women have it worse so forget about men.

It's all bad, it all has to stop, and dividing ourselves into 27 sub-movements with slightly different target groups who all bicker to be in the spotlight at the expense of everyone else is just a waste of time and effort. Abolish *all* mutilation.

&gt;For sure, ""all lives matter"" and ""genital mutilation because of religious reason should be illegal"". But just like ""all lives matter"" shouldn't be put under a BLM article or discussion MGM should not be the main topic to talk about under a FGM Article.

It's a useful point of comparison to see what hurdles await to abolish it. Fundamentally, the fact that similar practices happen to different genders shows that it's not as gender-related as sometimes is implied. It's more a matter of traditionalism and exercising power over children, that is just taking a worse shape for women in some areas (and worse for men in others). So we can arrive at a better insight to the fundamental driver of the problem and join up forces.

The Old Masters, beating up England, the first modern republic. Those are all great achievements along side the social structure embedded in Dutch society, where even the poor were better off than in most countries.

Do I approve of everything that has been done? No, since I'm not an historian I don't feel qualified to evaluate the past in approval or rejection. Do I think it is an important time period to learn  from and be inspired by for modern society and reflection? Yes, very much so.

We still had racism, and sadly still have some of it to this day, but it wasn't and isn't as pronounced.

365,"In 2018, households accounted for 26.1% of final energy consumption in the EU. Most of the EU final energy consumption in the households is covered by natural gas (32.1%) and electricity (24.7%). Renewables account for 19.5%, followed by petroleum products (11.6%) and derived heat (8.7%). A small proportion (3.4%) is still covered by coal products (solid fuels).

Energy consumption in households by type of end-use

In the EU, the main use of energy by households is for heating their homes (63.6% of final energy consumption in the residential sector). Electricity used for lighting and most electrical appliances represents 14.1% (this excludes the use of electricity for powering the main heating, cooling or cooking systems), while the proportion used for water heating is slightly higher, representing 14.8%.

 Main cooking devices require 6.1% of the energy used by households, while space cooling and other end-uses cover 0.4% and 1.0% respectively. The heating of space and water consequently represents 78.4% of the final energy consumed by households.

It's not. South Korea has no need of the US to win a war with North Korea with the exception of a situation where China can justify joining the war. However, China would **never** join the war to support the North if the North attacked us first, as that would lead to international sanctions on them, destroy their economy, and that would lead to citizen revolution that would overthrow the CCP. They're rational actors, and they won't jeopardize their economy to help North Korea win if the North attacks first. South Korea would never attack the North first, so that's simply not a situation that could come up and help justify China supporting the North in a defensive war.

460,"It's nothing to do with downplaying or excusing anything. As you say, they're dead and gone, it's ancient history.

...but the value of history is in being able to learn from it. In knowing what actually happened, so it can be prevented from happening again. Simplifying history makes it useless for learning from, it becomes a shallow fairytale when you boil it down so much. The reality of what happened then is fundamentally the same as reality now: it's complicated. It isn't black and white, it's messy and entirely contextual. Nobody agrees on anything and millions of people were involved at every point, with millions of different viewpoints and ideas going on the whole time.

Ignoring that complexity in favour of simplistic mistruths is what allows history to repeat itself. The Nazis didn't have majority support *and they didn't need it in order to do what they did*. Their methods were insidious and manipulative, they practically wrote the book on manufacturing consent (that is, the idea, not the actual Noam Chomsky book). They played the system right to the very end, and part of their strength was that they could manipulate existing systems to both create the impression of total uniformity and submission, AND to work to make it happen, by killing and suppressing dissenters. Most people didn't support the Nazis at all... but they were definately shit scared of being vanished off to a camp, or hung in the town square for publically dissenting from that piece of shit Hitler.

Hitler was the target of at least 22 assassination attempts that we know of. Those attempts weren't coming from the magical ether, they were actual people trying to stop him. People tried to resist the Nazis the whole time they were in power. The Nazis didn't have majority support, in fact they spent most of their energies in the pre-war years actively stamping out resistance. First they ruled through lies, then they ruled through fear when the lies weren't enough any more.

The reason it's important to remember that is because *it can happen again*. A lot of people (myself included) think it *is* happening again. Therefore, it's important for people to know the Nazis didn't need majority support to sieze control. They were a fringe group who stopped being fringe by killing anyone who stood up to them, and then rigging the system once their opponents were dead, to ensure nobody could stand up to them. 

Reactionary thugs don't ever need majority support to take over, they almost every time are a forcible takeover by a minority of what are basically organised sociopaths, who then consolidate power by selectively eliminating public opposition to their control, typically through violence, but more often in recent years, through coercive control techniques. People forgetting that, in the current geopolitical landscape would be very dangerous for our efforts to stop history repeating itself. We can't learn what lessons we need to learn from a simplified black and white history.

People from her ideological circle which I'm guessing from the article actually very rarely, if ever, claim that *we would be better off if we stopped thinking of humanity as categorized into races because race from a biological standpoint doesn't exist*. On the contrary - they are all about identities and how those identities interact with each other. They treat 'black' and 'white' as one of those identities, as real categories, worthy of discussion and critical inquiries, particularly in the political context.

If she meant what you claim she meant the obvious corollary is that the same what she wrote could have been written about black lives. But you should know well that her ideological circle would crucify anybody who would write that phrase. Justification for that is groups of 'black' (whatever they mean by that) people are perpetually oppressed and racialised which somehow makes their identity more, for lack of better word, 'real'.

""White lives don't matter."" 

If you say ""black lives matter"" as protest against police brutality against blacks, then using a negator means the opposite, meaning that police brutality against whites is okay.

Besides the point. It's a reaction to your claim that she was making her message that way ""to make things more clear and accurate."" Apparently that went entirely the other way then, since she claims to be so misunderstood.

And since it's her job as scientist to formulate unambiguous, falsifiable theses, as an educator to give reliable insights to her students, and as a public service to communicate clearly to the public, I do think that she should be getting a concerned talk about her functioning by her alma mater rather than a promotion, and perhaps should concentrate on her work, where she can doublecheck for gaffes, rather than shooting from the hip on twitter.

That's strange, because you seem to not understand the concept of purchasing a missile from someone who manufactures them, as opposed to leasing them. 

&gt;Imagine believing that.

[Imagine not believing that](https://www.reddit.com/r/Arianespace/comments/6hm5aj/arianespace_valuation_500_million_rocket_lab_1/)

&gt;This is not lost on me, I said it before the UK can launch a strike without the US approval (at least on paper). The UK has no deterrence by itself, it leases its SLBMs so it's not independent. That's it.

Ah, now we've retreated to ""At least on paper"" How many times do I have to explain to you that the US, whilst supplying the equipment *we buy* off them, doesn't have a final say on its useage. We don't even use permissive access codes, the authority comes directly from the PM and all the way down the chain of command. 

&gt;As of today, our nuclear deterrence is entirely French made and operated. The UK's is not. It's not arrogance, it's a fact that hurts your ego, but nonetheless an indisputable fact.

No it isn't, it's in part helped by a multinational in the form of ArianeGroup which constructs the M51 missile. My ego is fine with the French fielding their own nuclear weapons, it's your ego which can't accept that the British can buy a cheaper missile from the US and operate it independently. 

&gt;You cannot and never have.

We've developed rocket technology before, it's not that difficult, it's cheaper to collaborate with the US, just like you do with European partners through the ArianeGroup, but I guess your ego can't handle that admission. 

&gt;Because you don't own the SLBMs, no matter the choice of wording of the UK successive governements. 

But we do own them, hence the *purchase of them for Trident*

&gt;You lease them, and if the US decides to stop leasing them to you you have no deterrence. 

Lease implies you give back the equipment, we don't do that, we purchase the equipment and we have a contract with US manufacturing companies to maintain and service the equipment. The purchasing arrangements are through a mutual defence treaty, so if the US signalled the end of the program or vice versa, it would be done under the pretense of the British shouldering the entire burden of the SLBM programme *beforehand.* 

&gt;Simple as that. It's gonna be funny because if Trump is reelected, he'll still be president when you have to renew the deal. Fun times ahead with trade talks most likely still going on.

[As of 2020, the most recent renewal was on 22 July 2014, extending the treaty to 31 December 2024, with minor changes for the Trident nuclear programme.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1958_US%E2%80%93UK_Mutual_Defence_Agreement)

&gt;Yep, you still don't understand how this all works. Then it's a bit out of your league for someone who didn't know the difference between an engine and a missile (still laughing about this one, sorry but it's so comical to see someone exposing their sheer ignorance all by themselves).

That's ok, it's an honest mistake due to your ""excellent"" Proficiency of the English language, make sure to learn the difference between a lease and a purchase. 

&gt;On that note, have a good day in your fantasy world where the UK is a relevant actor in space industry 

Let me know when France has a £14 billion space industry. 

&gt;and has SLBMs that no one has heard about! 

Never claimed that, I implied we have the ability to initiate a programme if we needed too.

You're right. I don't see a difference. /s

&gt; That's exactly why I don't want to make deals with Nation of Islam supporters.

You are telling me that you don't want to make a deal with Nation of Islam supporters because fascists will abuse you if you make deals with fascists right after you told me want to make deals with fascists ""using the principle of balance of power"". 

""Fascists are bad and will betray you, except the fascists I support""? Is that it?

&gt; ""Talk so much"" literally not a single comment in support of them.

Literally your words:

&gt; I like my culture though, they can be useful in defending it

""fascists can be useful in defending my culture"" is supporting fascists. 

&gt; Okay, then what stops you from using the same wording, but with black?

Nothing stops me. Nothing stops me from quoting Hitler either. But how is this relevant to her? I am a different person.

&gt; At worst, she's actively saying she doesn't want whites to exist.

For the forth time: No, she isn't.

&gt; At best, she's basically saying a very convoluted and shitty version of ""all lives matter"" - something that certain people literally consider hate speech now.

If you cannot decide if she's is saying white lives don't matter or if she's saying all lives matter then what are you even angry about? In fact, you have just argued that the matter is a bit more complicated. This is a great breakthrough.

&gt; Because I believe you don't have brain damage and don't need people to repeat literally 5-word long sentences without forgetting them.

I was asking because you never actually quote her words and because I told you several times that she said more. You think it was just 5 five words which just proves you haven't actually read the article and are not aware of her explanations. There was a reason why I keep saying this:

&gt; You can certainly disagree but you cannot mischaracterize what she said by arguing that she doesn't want white people to live, as people have done in this thread.

You got angry before being fully informed on what happened. Is this a rational approach? You want to cancel her over your own misunderstanding and are willing to align yourself with fucking fascists to achieve that goal.

674,"Dude, I've lived in a bunch of cities in different countries. You're talking to me like I'm some simpleton who never even went to Porto. As a former urban planner I've discussed gentrification multiple times way before The Guardian readers in Porto and Lisbon started using the word in connection with the increase in tourism and short rentals. That's literally not what gentrification is.

""Other options like the whole fucking country"" what, do you spend the night in Rostov when you want to visit Moscow to not upset the locals? Maybe a cheap BnB in Birmingham on your London getaway? I get it, when we love a city so much, we almost want it for ourselves and maybe our close group of friends. But being against ""mass tourism"" is being against, well, less wealthy people being able to enjoy traveling. But it's 2020 and Porto is a global city in a global country in a global continent in a global world. The times when you could rent a 2 bedroom for 300 euros are long gone and will never come back. Because those prices are from a time where young people in the region would rather go study in Braga or Aveiro rather than live in the absolute shithole that was Porto until the mid to late 2000s. A dirty, insecure, depopulating, semi-abandoned town whose only source of entertainment was going to a Porto match - even the goddamn malls were all in the suburbs.

Porto was cheap because, frankly, it sucked. It's a great town these days thanks to gentrification - because artists, entrepreneurs, restaurant and bar owners, cultural agents that were way wealthier than your average city dweller made it great. Then, the second wave of gentrification started with all the yuppies that could afford all these things moving in for their decently paid jobs, making the city more expensive. Then came the tourists, the ""expats"", the real estate agents. That's the third wave of gentrification. You can't blame it for destroying the city because it would never have happened without the first two. And we're all to ""blame"" for that. Airbnb is a just a great scapegoat for that ""identity"" erasure. The word you're looking for is not gentrification, it's globalization.

(Also, if you think it's that hard to find a flat in Porto, try Amsterdam, a city that has put restrictions on short rentals for years and where you can't rent not even a room in your house for more than 90 days a year. You'll abandon that idea that it's Airbnb making a city expensive in less time that it will take you to find a shit room in the suburbs.)",Callaecia/Traiectum,/r/europe/comments/hfm1np/porto_portugal/fw08al9/,leavethecity,1593126555

In Japan more adult diapers are sold than baby diapers. They face a massive problem, especially considering how long their elderly tend to live for. There's also a lot of NEETs in Japan, people who simply cant cope with the extreme work culture.

Japans culture also actively discourage change because you shouldnt protest and you shouldnt go against tradition, so any improvements on this area will take ages. They also basically have a casteless system, the people on the bottom of society in Japan has no way forward. The culture tells them taking any help or in any way be a ""burden"" to the system is shameful, so they just get stuck in perpetual homelessness etc, ignored by the rest of society as they walk around the cities like ghost collecting trash to sell etc.

* doing them during a worldwide pandemic which apparently has already caused a surge in new cases in many places in the USA is dumb; especially considering how the ""I can't breathe"" slogan becomes ironic;
* the widespread violence that came with them is completely unacceptable in my book; I'd expect a lot more civilized behaviour from a developed country.

Defunding the police, however, might have poor results on police work and this could boost crime. The core idea that cops are there to enforce the law and provide security has been forgotten in many of the protests, they've been collectively been made as some kind of a villain.

The problem how police violence is dramatically overblown and people start feeling vindicated about attacking the police is also a problem which has also made it to Europe. In countries where the police is generally very peaceful, like UK or Sweden, several attacks against policemen and police cars have been made and this often by immigrant groups.

However, I'd also make a bold claim that migrants from some regions (e.g. Middle East and Africa) are just so much more problematic that it might be a good idea to avoid taking major number of less educated ones from that region altogether. Let's be honest, you just won't face the same issues with Portuguese, Koreans or Brazilians.

Unfortunately, many Western European countries have had extremely unbalanced immigration policies, doing the exact opposite of what I described, taking masses from MENA region and very little from other countries. This has resulted in radically changing demographics, e.g. city of Brussels being 25% Muslim already.

Pew Research, a mainstream polling and research foundation, has estimated that [Sweden might be 31% Muslim by 2050](https://external-preview.redd.it/1_VV9xhHwtKuN3CzUUWgLiwLuZXxTkzGfDAiuWdWWek.png?width=830&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb2289943ce6d21ca2c8a2ec08cd0a36fbb517ac) (in a high migration scenario), which would likely mean that Stockholm, Malmö and Göteborg would all be majority-Muslim cities, as migrants concentrate mostly in major urban areas. While the likelihood of this is not high, the very fact that such dramatic demographic shifts are now actually discussed as possible scenarios, illustrates quite well that immigration policies in some Western European countries are not just ""bad"", but absolutely shocking disasters.

U.S is a melting pot, especially the coastal cities. Each ethnicity and race have their own culture here. That ain't the topic though.

I don't think you are realizing how biased your opinion sounds bud. It carries the tone of this sub. I don't mean that as an insult to you personally. It's just how it sounds. I'm just pointing it out. It's not my problem if it makes others uncomfortable.

 Greece is not the Roman empire nor the Byzantine empire. Turkey is not the Seljuk nor the Ottoman Empire. That is an extremely toxic way to look at history. It's the reason why you think those two countries are so different. In reality, all those empires included both of those people.

Turkey doesn't have a huge historical baggage the carry.     Nor does Greece. Y'all are too damn poor to cause any real destruction since Ottomans. Except for the time period where Greece got too ambitious and attacked west of Anatolia. All the examples you have given me are from former States. All the displacement of populations are genocides. Whether it was Armenians, Assyrians, Greeks or Turks. Nobody needs to acknowledge these genocides. Millions of people have died. That's enough proof.

Turkey is not trying to be Ottoman Empire. She can't. It's simply not possible. That's nothing but paranoia. Do you say France is bringing French Empire neck when they attack and destroy Libya? No you don't. Do you say about Brits when they took part of destroying Afghanistan and Iraq? No you don't. Those 2 are way more destructive and powerful than Turkey. Look at their economy for God's sake. 

Turkey made a grave mistake again by taking millions refugees again. They did this for Kurds in 90s and it costed them dearly in the long run. Now they are doing it with Arabs. 

I spent way too much time reading and learning about Turkish and Greek history last few days. I spent time in both this and Turkish sub.

897,"&gt;Overall, I've found Europeans, especially the more anti American ones, to be far less intelligent than they think they are. The above quote really shows it.

So because I think that a lot of people, me included, were seeing a romanticized version of America and that, when confronted with the reality it made it feel like the US started getting worse when it most likely never was the perfect thing we were fed, I'm ""far less intelligent than I think I am""? Way to start off your comment man.

&gt;America is better when it comes to racism and treating minorities.

The US does have a more open discussion about race issues. I'm really not competent enough on this subject to judge whether this way of the ""European way"" is better.

&gt; Now I can just hear the keyboards banging ""BUT WE DON'T EXECUTE PEOPLE ON THE STREET"" 

So you really decided to go all in the ""my interlocutor is dumb and/or a dick"" haven't you?

901,"I made the distinction between responding WELL and responding EARLY. European countries like Italy and Spain were late but they ultimately did the right thing by imposing proper lockdowns, and now they are reaping the benefits, because they have all but eliminated the outbreak (it is endemic at a very low controlled rate). They have been cautiously returning to normal for over a month (and hopefully can control it going forward).

In the US, it is the opposite, it has just started spiraling out of control. I believe cases are on the rise in the majority of states now.

It is not the ONLY country to willfully have such a bad response (it can proudly sit next to Brazil), but the response has without a question been worse than European countries. The full consequences haven't even been seen yet, deaths lag by weeks. The UK which is the worst country in Europe currently has less than 1000 cases a day. The US is approaching 40,000 (even if you account for population, that is very bad).

1035,"A few days ago, when even German politicians and regulators could no longer ignore the size of the Wirecard debacle (€1.9 billion or $2.1 billion for now, and still counting ...) the country’s economy minister Peter Altmaier, while expressing shock (shock ...) at the scandal, also voiced his fears about the “reputation of Germany as a banking center.”

To which a reasonable reply would be: What reputation?

The fintech that was once a wonder of the German stock exchange became on Thursday the first company included in the blue-chip DAX index to file for insolvency. That came a few days after its management board (or what remains of it after a couple of resignations, including that of longtime Chief Executive Markus Braun, arrested on Monday by prosecutors and released on €5 million bail) admitted that nearly €2 billion mysteriously declared last week to be “missing” from the company’s bank accounts in fact didn’t exist.

Things happen, and Wirecard is likely to be mentioned in future business management classes as an example of both the promises and dangers lurking in what is now called the fintech industry. But the immediate lesson of the scandal should first be taught in German universities and business schools.

It would point out the benign approach, to say the least, taken by regulators in the long months that preceded Wednesday’s insolvency filing. An unconvincing explanation has been provided, along the lines that German financial regulators considered Wirecard a tech company, and business watchdogs took it for a bank.

But the reality is that Wirecard benefited from the obvious hands-off approach of German regulatory authorities, which prompted the head of the banking watchdog BaFin, Felix Hufeld, to admit this week that “a whole range of public and private entities including [his] own” hadn’t been effective enough.

When the Financial Times began, as far back as 2015, to raise questions about the company’s unusual accounting practices, its reporters were soon met with threats of lawsuits. Three years later, the reaction of BaFin to allegations by the same newspaper of financial improprieties in the company’s Asian office was to investigate the business daily for market manipulation.

Not to be outdone, German regulators also seemed to blame investors for the company’s problems, when they banned short selling Wirecard’s stock for two months last year.

Members of the German Parliament are beginning to lay the groundwork for a thorough investigation into what is already being called “the German Enron.” But the problem may be wider than a company that went bust.

It has been an open secret for years that the banking system is the weakest part of the German economy. It is archaic, based on the retail side on a network of savings banks that support the infamous “Landesbanken,” the regional banks that act as corporate lenders, but are themselves often operating under rules dictated by the close relationship between local politicians and businesses.

Meanwhile, the country’s two largest banks, Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank (as it happens, the company that Wirecard replaced in the DAX index two years ago), seem to be caught in a never-ending doom spiral of restructuring plans that only last until the next ones, strategic rethinks, job cuts, and share prices in free fall. They operate under chief executives who do what they can, but the legacy of years of complacency or failed outsize ambitions abroad is one that is hard to shake.

So Altmaier can be reassured: In terms of banking reputation, there is not much that Germany has to fear. Ideally, Wirecard can now be used as an opportunity to think hard about the type of financial system Germany needs and wants for itself.

Altmaier’s colleague Olaf Scholz, who only last week was still saying against all evidence that “regulators worked very hard and did their job,” has now promised to review rules to allow for better surveillance and regulation. So here’s hoping that Germany won’t waste its latest corporate crisis.",,/r/europe/comments/hfnkz1/wirecard_debacle_shows_financial_flaw_in_germanys/fvykptd/,JackRogers3,1593097305

1077,"I personally decided to move to South Korea. I had a background in linguistics, so getting my foot in the door as an English teacher was super easy. Technically you don't need any linguistics background- just have a four year degree in anything from the US and you'll qualify.

Anyway, I got my paperwork together and started looking for a job on a Tuesday. By that Saturday, I was in South Korea. I taught English for 3 years while teaching myself Korean, then started the Korean Social Integration Program, completed levels 4 and 5 (skipped 1-3 because I tested out), and then passed the Korean Immigration and Naturalization Aptitude Test. I then got my F2-7 long term residency visa. After 3 years, I upgraded to an F5 permanent residency visa. I hear that the F5 may be harder to get now due to income requirements, whereas back in my day it was possible to qualify for it by showing how much you had saved in your bank accounts rather than your yearly income.

But yeah, regardless, at least in South Korea, anyone who isn't a complete teacher tourist can at least get a long term residency visa (the F2-7). All it takes is a general university degree, fluency in Korean and willingness to prove it, plus some volunteer work (I did 150+ hours over a 3 year period, as you needed 50 hours per calendar year, and each year gave you more points towards the F2).

In Korea, once you're on an F visa, you no longer need to waste your time being an English teacher (it's a dead end career unless you can grab a highly competitive university position). You can work as an editor, or at a trade company, or whatever else you're good at. Sure, you have to compete with Koreans, but if you're worthy of immigrating here, that shouldn't be too hard.

What would be OPSEC is in which cave is what stuff (so enemy would know to target the important caves) and also where exactly the caves are. Since there is also thousands more other caves dug to bedrock in Finland. So Opsec would be to reveal what cave entrances lead to FDF caves and not just say to a mining shaft, under ground technical facility like water treatment plant etc.

Heck in main finnish national news there have been in non descript tunnel under Helsinki during exercise and observed stuff like conscripts guarding a pretty non descript metal door behind which is FDF storage Hall. Reporter ask the staff officer leading the unit ""so what you guarding?"" His flat pan answer was ""well could be spare blankets or could be surface to air missiles"". Aka what is in the storage cave is way before most peoples pay grade even inside FDF.

Can't leak what one doesn't know. Hence why FDF is pretty lax with most conscripts talking in net. They are intentionally not told anything specific of war time operations. Since you can't trust 70-80% of the male population to keep their mouths shut. So they aren't told OPSEC stuff.

As for tipping. At a bar it’s slightly different. Say you were just paying cash, you might leave a dollar per order or so. In this case, you might be paying to ensure that the bartender serves you before others at a crowded bar. But you’re also not required to leave a dollar per order at a truly crowded bar, they won’t even know you’re doing it. 

For a purely transactional experience, I’d say $7-$10 tip on $50 bill is fair. Heck, you’d likely get away with $5.

1153,"This is historical revisionism. To the extent that the US is ""a shithole country"" as a few people said, and which I disagree with, it's never been better in the past.

The rate of violent crime in the US has decreased by almost **50%** from the early 1980's to now. All the violence you hear about now - there was twice as much in the vaunted golden age you bring up.

In 1987, according to [Gallup](https://news.gallup.com/poll/1651/gay-lesbian-rights.aspx), 57% of Americans thought homosexual activity should be illegal. Not gay marriage, *sexual activity*. 73% of Americans now agree there should be no such laws. 

In 1990, according to [Pew](https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2017/05/18/2-public-views-on-intermarriage/) 63% of Americans would be very or somewhat opposed to a relative marrying a black person. That number is 14% today. 39% of Americans now assert that interracial marriage is not only acceptable, it positively improves our society compared to intraracial marriage. 

Economic inequality is America is a problem, but median real household income (not mean!) has still increased from 52k in 1984 to 63k in 2018, even as prices for durable household goods and electronics have dropped sharply.
(Medical and college costs have vastly outpaced inflation, but the seeds of those problems were laid in the systems built in the 70s and 80s; they need to be reformed, but the state they are in today is not so much a result of societal degradation, but the inevitable consequences of bad system design.)

According to the [EPA](https://www.epa.gov/air-trends/air-quality-national-summary), since 1980 there has been a 65% decrease in nitrogen dioxide in the air, a 92% decrease in Sulfur Dioxide, and a **98%** reduction in lead pollution. 

The US has a long way to go on reducing carbon emissions, but even there, increased power use efficiency, reductions in coal usage, and increases in renewables have led to a [steady level](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/inventory-us-greenhouse-gas-emissions-and-sinks) of carbon emissions since 1990 despite a doubling of real GDP over that time. Again, the carbon emissions per dollar of economic output were cut *in half* over that period of time. 

The US spends inordinate amounts of money on our military? [In 1985](https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/USA/united-states/military-spending-defense-budget) we spent 6% of our GDP on our military; in 2018 we spent 3.16% on our military. 

I don't want to sound like a cheerleader for the US here. There are inordinate numbers of things that we have gotten wrong, and continue to get wrong. But the trend over my lifetime has been things getting better in almost every measurable metric. We have a bad leader right now, but we've had bad leaders before.

1249,"&gt; Your podcast is ridiculously editorialized.

Well the dude is trying to make the point that it's possible, he's going to try his best to make that point. He opens his podcast with a prelude: a description of a man that wakes up because something was bombed close by by some rebel group. But he isn't too shaken up about it and decides to go to the local grocery store to beat the crowd. He thinks about the time when meat and eggs were still affordable, passes a police checkpoint, and wonders why politicians are still worrying about the 2024 election instead of focusing on what is clearly a civil war.

He then goes on:

*""Did that seem far fetched to you? Outlandish? If so, let me try to show you why the preceding passage might well be reality for millions of Americans startlingly soon if something isn't done. The second American Civil war doesn't sound like a crazy, distant possibility to me, and hasn't for a while.* 

If anything it's great story telling, I really don't do it justice here.

And you realize I would love to be proven wrong right? Message me after a peaceful transfer of power has taken place come January, laugh at me then. In the meanwhile listen to the podcast.

1285,"My comment was a reaction to your statement ""So it was not really an issue up untill 19th century when smaller nations like Estonians also got into National Romanticism"". I wanted to stress, that it indeed _was_ an issue (and your answers elsewhere support it). Furthermore, there was during Swedish times (17th century) active Swedification process and local Baltic-Germans were very much annoyed by it, feeling nationally suppressed. So it is gross simplification to say that such national tensions started at the beginning of the 19th century. Your statement irked me because there is in recent historiography a tendency to say that national differences and tensions did not exist before Enlightenment and you seem to fall into that camp. 

Your second statement ""In medieval ages people were killed and oppresed by religion” is similarly simplification. Church (and pope as its head) itself did not oppress anyone, as they had no army. They had to list secular armies for help and these had their own agendas also, often acting completely against the wishes of the popes or local bishops. During Crusades there developed some military monastic orders (like Teutonic order), who ""killed and oppressed"", but there were constant disputes and arguments within church about these practices and the Order acted very much as a state of its own and its own interests. They often accepted baptism as a form of submission by the natives, but this act was used for the purpose of contract to pay taxes to the Order and cease military activities - this is why the washing away of baptism was practiced by the locals here, as they thus publicly declared that they are not subjects to the Order - it had very little to do with religion. Religion in medieval times is comparable to what today we would call ""western values"", ""democracy"" etc, i.e. some ideological framework that permitted larger groups to work together and understand each others principles. You can not say that „democracy instigates wars”, however you can say that „US has instigated wars” or something along those lines. It just pains me to see that people paint medieval times as some kind of religious backward fanatical period, where people just liked to kill in the name of religion. This comes (here) usually because the teachers and their teachers have been educated during Soviet times where the concealed curriculum of scientific atheism instilled such understanding into the historical narrative. So the complexities of medieval society and the function medieval religion had is totally missed or presented in a much distorted manner. 

But I don’t expect that internet argument will bring some sense into that issue, according to my experience people just tend to entrench further into their positions. There is good recent historical research about these issues, but this does not reach general audience.

Le Pen and the RN/FN whatever they wanna call themselves these days party are a far right party with no actual intention to rule.

Because the people in France that are not voting LePen would vote anyone else to bare this party from getting in power Le Pen. 

Le Pen knows this and doesn't wanna rule they wanna leech off people and stir the shit once in while. But they usually don't really offer any real opposition when it comes to lawmaking.

To this day I'm still convinced she sabotaged her 2nd turn debate to offer Macron victory in 2017 just watch the debate Le Pen have always been able to be a lot more demagogic than that. She was way off her usual game and I'm pretty sure it was intentional

**Highest shares of non-nationals in Luxembourg, lowest in Poland and Romania**

In relative terms, the EU Member State with the highest share of non-nationals was Luxembourg, at 47% of its total population. A high proportion of foreign citizens (10% or more of the resident population) was also observed in Cyprus, Malta, Austria, Estonia, Latvia, Ireland, Belgium, Germany and Spain.

In contrast, non-nationals represented less than 1% of the population in Poland and Romania.

In most EU Member States, the majority of non-nationals were citizens of non-EU countries.

Yep, but excluding the fact that the junta were the ones who did it, it was something that both cypriots and greeks generally wanted. For instance, a referendum (amongst only greek cypriots) in 1950 was 98% for reunification.

&gt; so does Turkey since the Ottoman times

Mehhh, Turkey doesn't really have a connection, Ottomans controlled the island for some time but that's it. At the time of the dispute, Cyprus demographics were not evenly split or anything, only like 10% of the population were Turkish cypriots and most others Greeks.

---
Though, since Greece and Cyprus were both governed by military coups at the time, it was understandable for Turks to intervene to ensure the safety of the turkish minority.

The CDG being the sole aircraft carrier is actually a bullet that has been dodged by the government for about 20 years until last year, as France's doctrine is to have 2 to prevent those issues you've mentioned. 

But at the same time an attack on mainland France wouldnt be much different as to if France has the CDG refueled or not. French Rafales have been taking off from a French airbase to go to Mali for quite some time now, as they have enough range, so an attacking enemy wouldn't care if it was online or not. 

Aircraft carriers are not defensive ships, they are used as a forward base capable of hitting any point on earth. When it's refueling that is the only time when an enemy can sort of keep calm. But at the same time the French share the same CATOBAR system as the Americans and as such can conduct join missions.

Obviously I'm not saying the QE class is bad, it's an excellent ship with highly advanced systems and it's a massive asset to the British Navy. it's just that the CDG still holds its weight compared to them, especially considering the use of a CATOBAR system.

Also I want to make it clear that I'm not trashing on the QE, just that the CDG offers a lot that a VTOL system can't and therefore should still be considered as a pretty significant ship, at least to the same level as the QE class if not more.",,/r/europe/comments/hf3dl6/the_eus_biggest_standing_armies/fvwiqcv/,captaingawax,1593040111

1965,"Thats what I meant about wind turbines, you can improve them, make them more reliable but there is hard limit of how much energy they can generate under perfect condition, its so called: Betz's law.

Betz's law indicates the maximum power that can be extracted from the wind, independent of the design of a wind turbine in open flow. It was published in 1919 by the German physicist Albert Betz. The law is derived from the principles of conservation of mass and momentum of the air stream flowing through an idealized ""actuator disk"" that extracts energy from the wind stream. According to Betz's law, no turbine can capture more than 16/27 (59.3%) of the kinetic energy in wind. The factor 16/27 (0.593) is known as Betz's coefficient. Practical utility-scale wind turbines achieve at peak 75–80% of the Betz limit.

American concepts like white privilege and affirmative action are political non-starters, said [Corinne Narassiguin](https://www.parti-socialiste.fr/les_sn), the No. 2 official in France’s Socialist Party.

In its years in power, the party failed to help integrate nonwhite groups because it had relied exclusively on economic and social policies, said Ms. Narassiguin, who lived in the United States for 13 years and is from Réunion, the French department in the Indian Ocean.

It is necessary, she said, to tackle discrimination and racism directly: for example, by reforming police identity checks that the government has [acknowledged](https://www.defenseurdesdroits.fr/fr/actus/actualites/relations-policepopulation-le-defenseur-des-droits-publie-une-enquete-sur-les) unfairly target black and Arab youths, or by raising awareness in employee training and human resources in the private sector.

Trying to deny that fact simply because the plantation took place before the act of Union is just pedantic. Yes, technically their residence there predates the modern UK, but they were still sent by the English crown.

I understand what you're saying though that at this point they've been here for centuries, and so are Irish. Oh except many of them don't like to be called Irish.

I don't it's fair to say that all Irish nationalism/republicanism is ethnonationalistic. Just look at how prominent Presbyterians and Church of Ireland members were in the 1798 rebellion (Wolfe Tone, McCracken, etc.). Then later an unremarkable guy by the name of Charles Stewart Parnell.

Honestly I think there was just an enormous overlap between the ruling class and Anglo Irish Protestants. And when you have a revolution, who are the first to get scared and run? The wealthy, the aristocracy, the ruling classes. And yes it should be aknowledged that of course there were less well to do Anglo Irish Protestants,  but they were not the majority. Bottom line is the Anglo Irish may have felt uncomfortable in the years after independence, but they were not systematically persecuted. And I think any rational person has to aknowledge the contributions the Anglo Irish have made to republicanism in Ireland.

2075,"You are putting words in my mouth. First of all, some gas plants can be kept for load balancing when there's no hydro but only 1 to 2% of gas electricity production is needed at most. Nobody is talking about Hinkley point in Africa... Solar panels can work there and they don't have the grid to make the best of conventional plants.

&gt;Just one example: Solar-Park Weesow-Willmersdorf in Brandenburg, Germany. 187 MWp and no feed-in tariffs. The only subsidy is the prioritisation over conventional fuels all renewable energy receives on the German energy market.

First of all it isn't built. Then, it's 187 MW powering 50 000 homes... Jesus, you'll need 30 farms like this one (using 50 km² of land !) to replace 1 nuclear plant... Germany would need to build 30 of those each year just to replace the nuclear plants that will close before 2025... 

Like you said, 2 years to build 1/30th of a nuclear plant which will produce during a third of the lifetime of a nuclear plant. So it's similar to a 180 years long nuclear plant project. This isn't efficient at all, it's dangerously low.

No subsidies to build but what's the selling price ? Will it be the spot price or will it be a guaranteed one ?  

&gt;Even in France and the US, countries with extremely well-developed nuclear infrastructure, the few new projects are proving to be extremely expensive, complex and slow (Vogtle, Flamanville). I'm not saying the current level of generation has to be replaced, but can Japan, the US etc. realistically ramp up their electricity generation from nuclear by more than a factor of three or so over the next two-three decades? Doubtful.

Yes, first of line new gen nuclear plants after a 30 year hiatus aren't cheap and are prone to delays, Russia and China don't have this problem. Nuclear plants are supposed to be chain built, that's how it was always done. If you want you can compare their cost with new gen wind power currently being built which is even more expensive than the two plants you mentioned.

&gt;You're committing the mistake of looking at electric costs based on wind/solar prices from twenty years ago. You should look at costs today. And they're dirt cheap. DIRT cheap and fast.

No they simply aren't. What's the price you're basing this on ? Are you including storage, guaranteed prices, grid adjustments, or the cost of keeping back up plants for when they're not producing ?

If they were dirt cheap, why are Danish, German and Spanish electricity prices the highest and rising ? It's like me saying nuclear is dirt cheap, it isn't, this is madness ! Why would we be arguing about getting rid of fossil fuels if the alternative was cheap ? It would already be done. 

&gt;the vitally needed sustainable energy sources

Solar and wind aren't more sustainable than gas or coal or nuclear. What we need is reliable low carbon energy, including renewable ones like concentrated solar, geothermy, biomass and hydro. Even solar and wind have their use, we should take everything but we shouldn't delude ourselves by thinking solar panels and wind farms will power the world or even be a significant source of energy. 

It's physically impossible, and it's the same for nuclear power by the way. So we should use our resources carefully and go for the most efficient energy while advocating for restraint and lower consumption overall. We only have one shot at this, going full solar and wind while betting on a storage miracle is insane when we already have a large scale low emission dispatchable energy requiring little land and material.",France,/r/europe/comments/heg752/recent_research_showed_that_germanys_nuclear/fvvqjgy/,Popolitique,1593026091

Hell, I lived in a 25 square meter studio and was paying around 800 with bills just because it was in a well connected lively area (but far from super desirable, was considered dodgy by many). 

Yeah, you can still get a studio for 450-500 euros with bills included, but it will be 20 mins walk to the nearest ubahn/sbahn station and then another 40 min ride to Mitte.

... Birth deficit means that 6.1 million were expected to be born, but weren't because of the starvation and lack of food, so theres really no point in even counting it as ""death"".. 

So this leaves us with 16.1 million still to be accounted for in the christian persecution, let's see. 
The official number there is 106,300 clergymen.

While there is also a claim for 12 million by James M. Nelson, and separately another claim for 20+million by Todd M. Johnson... 
Both of these men are american theologists and failed to provide any source for their claims in or after publishing their books, they are not historians, and their numbers stand in contradiction with nearly all other sources under the wiki page.

It's akin to me writing a book ""How the Soviet union erradicated itself"" and then state in the book that they've killed 170 million people, and the wiki page would say- ""estimates range between 12 and 170 million""

It's a bit silly they even included them as a source...

Anyway, so 3.9 Holodomor + 106,300 persecution of clergy = 4.006.300 people. Go on with your sources, to catch up with Hitler and Nazi germany, we still need about 16.930.700 to catch up to Nazi Germany in terms of kill count to match their number of 20.946.000 innocent civilians killed.

You just posted 2 of the most common ones, shall i help you wirh a few more ?

Katyn massacre +22.000
Deportation +566.000
Gulag +1.713.000
Great purge +1.200.000
Kulak persecution +600.000

And mind you I've taken the highest legitimate estimates for these 5 events.

So now we are at 8.107.300 innocent people killed by the soviet union in all of it's history vs 20.946.000 innocent people killed by Nazi Germany in 5 years.

You still need to provide me with sources that account for 12.838.700 civilian deaths to catch up to the 3rd reich.

It's quite obvious by now both of these that caused so much death are horrible. But you claimed here that the soviets were bigger killers than the nazis. So keep going, 12.8mil still to go.",,/r/europe/comments/hez2ho/victory_parade_russia_moscow_today/fvuwqkd/,YourLovelyMother,1593011649

Basically, in resume:

The Red Army came. They were stealing everything they saw, animals, money, basically everything.

Then they put a dictatorship. And killed tens of thousands in mass graves, people disappearing, basically a small scale genocide against the ""intelligent"" - teachers, priests, scientists, officers and so on.

Then they gave the power to uneducated and stupid servants of theirs. They gave the power to idiots because they were from the Socialist party.

Then, it was working like that - if you said ANYTHING agains the socialist party you disappear and die. You know North Korea. you were locked inside your country or in the other socialist countries. You were forbidden information, travel, free thinking, free market.

Yeah, you were living in a country ""restored"" with ""growing population"", but if you like living in a country WITHOUT being able to say anything, to write anything, to think anything or to travel and get any information - or otherwise you will DIE - you are okay.

2353,"&gt;That makes no sense. The POC population in the Netherlands entirely postdates slave trade, and they are not descendants of people who have suffered from segregation laws in the Netherlands, which is a completely different situation from the USA.

We currently have around 356 402 immigrants from Suriname and another 7576 from the ABC islands living in The Netherlands. I can safely say that at least 1/3 of them can trace their heritage back to slavery. So the claim that the POC population predates slave trade *entirely* is an underestimation. 

&gt;It's not blackface like blackface in the USA. Please stop projecting practices from Apartheid countries on it. Zwarte Piet is an extremely popular and positive figure which predates the visibility of Africans in the daily life of the Low Countries by centuries. It's an offshoot of religious plays and pre-Christian culture, and his race identity does not play a role in the celebration. It's just a visually distinct characteristic much like the long white beard of Sinterklaas or Santa.

Granted that Zwarte Piet has been seen as a positive role model for a majority of people, there are still a lot of people that find offence in the appearance, and imo honestly so. The background of the appearance is debated and I think you refer to the nordic-pagan tradition of the “Wild Hunt“. Even if so, the curly hair and emphasised lips have no other reference than portraying that of a black person. 

Preferring the appearance of Zwarte Piet as is, is saying that his race identity *does* play a role in the celebration.

2407,"&gt;You just said japan wants to stall and buy time? 


If they desperately wanted a trade deal they would have reached a compromise much earlier and the general terms of the trade agreement would have been worked out. It's not in the spirit of good and equal negotiation to demand your negotiating partner a time frame. It's more like how Trump negotiates either a take it or leave it approach.

Therefore Japan is buying time to see if UK compromises their position to theirs by demanding a time frame. It's a demand from Japanese negotiation team.



&gt;Japan is in TPP though, so if the UK joins then it would replace this deal.. So the UK joining TPP in the future would be very very relevant to this discussion....

But all the TPP mostly have the two other major economies like China and USA as its main trading partner. For Asia Australia, JP and NZ have China or the US as its largest trading partner. For Canada and Mexico, the proportion of trade with the US is even stronger.

UK is a 2.7T ecomomy and in terms of population and scale it is smaller than the Chinese, American and even the Japanese economy. Given Uk's geographic postion and its smaller population and markets, how could UK take advantage of the benefits of TPP when they are essentially competing with China and USA in those economies.",,/r/europe/comments/heogoh/japan_to_uk_weve_got_6_weeks_to_agree_trade_deal/fvu9b0p/,BF5lagsssss,1592996450

2472,"&gt;The solution here is better regulations.

Clemens Tonnies has enough money in his name to build several apartment complexes close to their main meat factory for the sole purpose of reducing overcrowding outside of the workplace. 

This results in profit both ways, you end up with several buildings, and you can wash your hands from your previous mistakes.

He won't do it since Germans don't care about human suffering. The German government doesn't care about human suffering, and consumers of tonnies products (most of that meat is exported) don't know of the human suffering. The media doesn't care about human suffering. 

Clemens Tonnies has amassed 6 billion euros from a 50% participation rate in the company over the years.
His family another 6 billion aswell. 

He could easily afford to make it a world class facility where people can  take pride in working there, yet he doesn't. Why would he? No one cares! And it will get brushed under the rug like all the illegal crap that happens in Germany. 

Everyone probably forgot about the asparagus scams/jobs from 2-3 months ago. 

Tonnies is blacklisted on worker lists, the only eastern european workers that end up there have either:

- got scammed by recruiters. 
- don't know what tonnies is and why it's a shit company. 
- are from some of the poorest regions of Europe.

2474,"&gt; If they desperately wanted a trade deal they would have reached a compromise much earlier 

How much earlier? They only started negotiations half way through this month. 

&gt; It's not in the spirit of good and equal negotiation to demand your negotiating partner a time frame. It's more like how Trump negotiates either a take it or leave it approach.

That’s because this trade deal is being seen as a stopgap to avoid a gap between the UK leaving the EU market and it joining TPP. If negotiations last longer, there’s no point. 

I’m glad you mentioned trump though. Since the US-Japan trade deal also had a very tight initial timeline (which they missed, but still got it under 6 months). Was Japan also steamrolling the US there ?

&gt; UK is a 2.7T ecomomy and in terms of population and scale it is smaller than the Chinese, American and even the Japanese economy. Given Uk's geographic postion and its smaller population and markets, how could UK take advantage of the benefits of TPP when they are essentially competing with China and USA in those economies.

It’s smaller than *even the third largest economy in the world?* Honestly I don’t get it.

A PhD has the know-how and correct identification of information nailed down. I wouldn't comment on issues I am not aware of the info. My thesis on realpolitik and Turkish foreign policy and national security had a lot to do with Ottoman era policies and history. 

&gt; The overwhelming majority of the sources 

Point to the fact that Arvanites came to the Greek mainland from Arvanon (hence the name Arvanite) and retained that name (similar to populations who moved from the same area to Croatia) having nothing to do with modern day Albanians who in contrast refer to themselves as Shqiptar. In fact these migrants don't even recognise as an identification the term Shqiptar (Arvanites today strongly identify as Greek as your own provided article points out). A major part in this migration was played by Peter IV of the Duchy of Athens. 

And here is when you have to delve deep into Albanian history to understand clan and people differences. Modern Albanian national identity is a pretty modern construct having no history prior to the 11th and 15th centuries. Prior to the Meshari there is not even anything concretely written that helps us identify them. What we know for sure though is that migration from that area previously mentioned resulted in various new identifications.

&gt; Why Poroshenko ""and his bros"" should be prisoned? Because his opponent won the election?

More likely because there's actual evidence of corruption (the Ukroboronprom and Leninska Kuznya case is the first thing that comes to mind).

The recent fiasco with paintings (and Poroshenko evading questioning for the billionth time) also seems a bit fishy. If you haven't stolen anything, then why hide from the DBR?

Removing a Prosecutor-General for no other reason than Biden wants it (Poroshenko himself admitted that there was ""no evidence of corruption"" on Shokin's part) seems like heavy corruption, going into treason. Don't tell me that they're faked, because Poroshenko himself admitted that they aren't (instead, he tried to say that ""it was justified"").

&gt;The Russian language has no recognition? How should it be recognized? There's one official language and it's Ukrainian but it doesn't limit anyone from speaking however they want. And please don't tell me about the oppressed Russian language. 

TV quotas. Movies in cinemas can only be ran in Ukrainian, even in majority Russian-speaking regions, as far as I know. 

Schooling in Russian will be cancelled from September of this year, with very few exceptions. Schooling in Hungarian/Romanian/Bulgarian (way less than 10% of the population, combined), however, will be cancelled only in 2023. And this is in a country where tons of people speak Russian in day-to-day life. 

I dunno man, seems like discrimination to me.

Don't get me wrong - it's completely normal to have a state language and have people learn it, but how hard can it be not to discriminate the speakers of other languages? We have 2 state languages in Belarus, and we're doing fantastic.

Here's a tip - completely ignore what a politicians says about corruption. It carries no information whatsoever. Everybody will promise to fight corruption. You can't force them to follow what they promised, and often the politicians that talk the most about justice and fighting corruption are the most corrupt.

Be especially careful when a politician talks about patriotism and blames something on one minority or another. That's almost certain sign he's stealing from you.

Instead of looking at their words simply look at:

 \- their past political activity regarding transparency and corruption. Were they voting for or against laws that are inconvenient for corrupt politicians? If they introduced a law that requires open competition for state officials that's a good sign. If they canceled such a law - that's a bad sign. Were they supporting a law that forces all state contracts to be public? Were they opposing it? What about laws that force politicians to say how much wealth they have, or what are they spending their party money on? Such laws exist in most countries and for example when you want to join EU you have to introduce them. It's a very good chance to see which politicians support it and which don't.

\- their approach to non-government organizations that support transparency, checks and balances - are they propagating conspiracy theories and presenting them as agents of foreign countries? That's a very bad sign - it means they don't want people that they can't control to look at what  they are doing.

 \- their career before they became politicians, how much wealth they have, which media support them and which criticize them, are they friends with oligarchs

2621,"There was the German-American Bund.  I wouldn't say that the country in aggregate was particularly enthusiastic about the Nazi Party.

There was considerable opposition to entry to the war, that much is true.  The US had no alliances or obligations in Europe and had generally ignored European wars.  Washington's Farewell Address when ending his presidency gave two recommendations for the future, and one of those was to stay out of Europe's wars. 

Beyond that, a considerable chunk of that was because the US had entered into World War I, and then many European countries — with the notable exception of Finland — had defaulted on their war debts to the US in a coordinated fashion at the Lausanne Conference.  That led to the creation of the Neutrality Acts, which prohibited, among other things, the extension of credit into the war.  Overcoming that was a major political task for Roosevelt.

Second of all: Sexual education is recomended by WHO at the very young age because for the love of god, young people should know that you shouldn't touch someone else's private parts or show your private parts to anyone. Sexual education is the education about genders and lowers the rape count and lowers the nonwanted pregnacy count. Anyone who have just a little bit of knowledge or read that goddamn book from WHO, understands that sexual education should be adjusted to the kid's mental nad physical age. Noone will talk with 7 year old about abortion or masturbation.

They will talk with him just not to let someone touch their private parts. Just watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XFjrwa8K8k). 

Third of all: He's using the constitution as a tool for his homophobic work. As a president he could change that, but he won't because that would help these people feel welcome. People who can't get married in Poland just move out to different country to get married. So he just doesn't want to help these people feel wanted in this country and he doesn't want them to feel normal here. 

He doesn't think that LGBT people are people as anyone else. He treats them as someone worse and he's saying that LGBT people can't make a good family.

Ofc there are those that believe in a some form of EU who then like to be called European and thos on the right who are still proudly flying the Reichskriegsflagge or the normal flag too.

&gt; Your relationship with your military is damn near 3rd world tier. 

It isn't, we are just not as stupid as the Amis when it comes to how to handel it in civil life.

&gt; With politicians deliberately sabotaging modernization and strengthening efforts because they are afraid of it. 

Or they just see no point in needlessly sinking money into something you probably don't need in the near future. Not to mention that there are also a few coruption scandals.

If by that you mean having victims of it talks in schools and focusing on it in history lessons then yah, we tend to do that. But outside of that barley anyone thinks that they are somehow responsible for it. We just make sure that it doesn't happen again.

&gt; let me remind you that you quite literally let millions of random people into Europe basically as a massive show of repentance.

At one point, the allies were beginning to lose the war since Russia was out. So what do you do if you've lent a shit ton of everything to someone? You see to it that he succeeds so he can then repay you. That's how USA got in the first war. By the time it ended, the financial center of the world moved from London to New York. 

The second war is just the sequal, since the allies still had debt to the USA. Somewhere along the line, this turned into an ideological confruntation led by America which was by that time a superpower with the atomic bomb in its hands and some very good leaders at the top.

It was all interest, otherwise the allies would have also invaded Romania( for example) , which begged for it at the end of the war, so it would not remain in the Russian sphere of influence. You guys only needed to come here and we would have all cheered for you.

So this is how the USA got to have its interests aligned with Europe. But it wasnt some interests, it was all of them, otherwise u guys would have remained neutral.

I would say that by following its interests, America also met some of Europe's.

So you think people being fed by nutrients and liquids through their veins, sleeping on the street, and only ever wearing one tunic is their needs being met? No, people need shelter, especially in a cold, rainy country. They need a variety of food for health. They need frequent changes of clothes for hygiene purposes. Please don't be disingenuous, you know perfectly well what a need is.

&gt; You're kinda right about advertising though, it is a drain on resources and a source of inefficiency in the market, not only on the resources that it directly uses,

But that's not what I wrote. I wrote that companies create wants through advertising, then waste resources and labour in creating product that meet these spurious wants. You can't know in advance what the public will buy, so you produce a glut of products which the public may not want, and the product is therefore simply thrown away, creating pollution. Or you produce a commodity with built-in obsolescence, because the demands of profit require you to sell more product, and the old product is discarded, and creates waste.",Scotland,/r/europe/comments/heg0uk/eu_innovation_scoreboard_2020/fvt08q4/,michaelnoir,1592961481

It is true that the Nazis massively fueled it during their occupation of North Africa with propaganda, but Jews were never very welcome there, just tolerated, most of the time.

In the TV segment which was put in the News, Christian Paul was supposed to be a recognized and respected American Fashion designer (in Poland many from the population think of American things and people as being superior).
The media accounts for this supposed designer (Instagram, Twitter YouTube) were created the same day the segment ran in the News. 

Independent News reports found that the person posing as the American Fashion Designer is an entrepreneur from Warsaw.

The National TV has a history of directly manipulating and fabricating evidence to support the party's narrative, such as by photo shopping LGBT rainbow flag from the President's Rally, or by removing stickers of support to the non-government supported charities from the people interviewed.

Why are we even involoved anymore? 1991 and 2018 became the years where America no longer had a reason for said hegemony. Communism died in 1991. We don't need the oil anymore after 2018. Why do we care about trade, we are an internal consumer based economy, exports never factored into our GDP by any major degree.

3043,"But we're not talking about countries' LGBT treatment here are we. You were discussing a single action by a single man, and you decided that it was all due to the religion you assumed he had. He committed an homophobic crime obviously guided by the principles of his hateful faith.

Yet when you considered that he might be Christian suddenly his religion was on a second place. Now it was homophobia, which obviously must be completely detached from his religion. That's a benefit you didn't give him before. Why is that? Specially when there are thousands of extreme Christians that murder LGBT people every other day in the Caribbean or in Africa guided by their faith?

It's not because there are more LGBT friendly majorly Christian countries that you made that distinction, no. It's not because they kill gays in Iran. And above it all, it's not because you give a damn about LGBT rights. You just wanted to make a point about how the whole Muslim faith is homophobic and therefore how everyone that follows Islam has the seed of hate inside. You used LGBT rights today and tomorrow you'll use something else. If you actually gave a damn about queer folk you'd acknowledge this as an act of hate without the need to minimize and completely erase the struggle of queer Muslims people and activists who are making a change for the better, specially as we still mourn for the loss of Sarah Hegazy.

3094,"&gt; USA made legislation that destroyed unions and the minimum wages are so low in many states the workers are working poor needing two jobs just to buy basic necessities. 

Working multiple jobs isn't a function of low minimum wage.  It's left-wing healthcare policy from Obama that did that.  Full-time employers — where the employee worked more than 30 hours per week — were required to provide healthcare benefits, effectively creating a artifically-high minimum wage for full-time workers, since benefits also had to come with it.

So employers simply refused to hire low wage workers for full time labor.  Result: people working two part-time jobs.

You're claiming that the European colonization or call it conquest of the world was morally reprehensible.

BASHI-BAZOUKS BEFORE A GATEWAY, c.  1887-88.

Oil on panel

46 by 35cm., 18 by 14¾in.
Private collection

&gt;Bashi-bazouks were irregulars in the Ottoman army and hailed from lands across the Ottoman empire, from Egypt to the Balkans. The strain on the Ottoman feudal system caused by the Empire’s wide expanse required heavier reliance on irregular soldiers.

&gt;Paul Joanowits, 1859 – 1957, was born in Vršac, formerly southern Hungary and today Serbia. He studied at the Vienna Academy from 1876 to 1883 under K. L.Müller. From there he sent his first painting to the art society in Budapest, earning him a Hungarian state scholarship. Like his teacher, he painted oriental images, in Vienna and later in Munich. 

&gt;During the late 19th century he painted scenes of the Serbian uprising for King Alexander of Serbia. Back in Vienna, his main interest lay in painting portraits, amongst which is a picture of Emperor Francis Joseph I. Joanovitch exhibited in Vienna, Munich and Berlin and today his works can be found in museums in Belgrade, Budapest, London, Munich and Vienna.",Serbia,/r/europe/comments/hemltq/albanian_warriors_in_ottomanera_egypt_painting_by/fvsaztc/,lukalux3,1592947748

Russia 200% controls Haftar. You think Russian Wagner mercenaries are suddenly in Libya for charity reasons? They are for *de jure* reasons called 'mercenaries', but in reality just the Russian army in disguise.

&gt;Egypt has been a great ally of the West in the battle against islamic terrorism (which Erdogan supports too, by the way).

The same can be said about GNA. But here is the point most people are missing: dictatorships create extremism. For you live is pretty, you can vote away the current government if you dislike. Egyptians can't. They see their loved ones electrocuted or killed when they want the government to change direction. They are left poor and uneduacted, so they see weapons as only solution, because weapons are how dictators came in power in the first place.

Also, it depends who you consider islamic terrorists? If you mean ISIS, then you can't say Turkey supported them. Turkey put Isis on their terrorist list as one of the earliest countries.  ISIS attacked multiple Turkish cities. Burned Turks in their videos. Threatened Turkey in their videos. Turkish soldiers died fighting ISIS in Syria. The GNA cleared ISIS from Sirte, afterwards Haftar took Sirte from GNA.

&gt;Erdogan not only does this too, he has illegaly invaded multiple countries

Not true. When did the Turkish army shot or electruced Turkish civilians? What country did Turkey invade? In Libya, Turkey is there at their request. In Syria and Iraq, it's fighting PKK only because the central government in unable to do it for Turkey. Also they are only at border region of neighbouring countries. Turkey is the last country you can rebuke, when considering the whole world (Western countries + others) from 1000 km far away are also in those countries plus in other countries around the globe.

&gt;millions of migrants into the EU

(1) Look who created these refugees? Mostly Russian and US interventions.(2) Turkey is not the immigrant and refugee dumping ground of EU. Turkey is not going to keep people in Turkey  who wants to leave Turkey. Why would any sane country want to cary all the burden alone?

&gt;Look at Syria, does Turkey back the internationally recognized government there?

No, because the government in Syria lost it's legitimacy by not being able to hold peacefull demonstrations turn into violent. Why did Assad tortured and butchered so many Syrians? Why did so many Syrians opposed Assad in the beginning? How many more people needs to die before you consider it illegitimate too? These are the questions you should ask yourself.

3352,"Well, the area-thing is true, but biomass is still burning stuff. Burning puts all the CO2 that the trees took out of the atmosphere back in there. It takes a long time for a fresh batch of trees to soak that back up, so it's not exactly a global warming solution if we then burn them again. Arguably it's better than putting deep deposits in the air, but not by much.

Cause keep in mind, when burning woodchips - which most bioreactors burn - they're often imported. The Netherlands imports an awful lot of woodchips from the United States. Large areas of forest are cut down by diesel powered heavy machinery, ground up in factories not exactly adorned with windmills, then shipped to port by trucks or trains and loaded onto cargoships which burn a petroleum based fuel that is *incredibly* foul compared to what goes in your car or even airplanes - cause it's cheaper - to then finally be burned here. I'm left wondering how much energy was expended, and how much carbon was emitted, before we ever got any energy out of it.

My energy mantra is simple: If you have to burn shit, don't do it. There's a carbon footprint to making solar panels and windmills as well, I understand, but at least once they're set up you're done for the next twenty years or so.

3415,"&gt;My point is Serbia for example has even worse urban blight. If you ever passed by Kopaonik, you would see what i mean. Even the worst Kosovo city, like Malisheva, looks better

Your point is deflection from the discussion and Whataboutism. I don‘t care about Serbia.

&gt;The diaspora doesnt become suddenly non Albanian. 

I never said otherwise

&gt;Dual cirizenship is a thing. Alot of money is reinvested directly from the diaspora whether by being in kosovo or by sending money. There is no better form of foreign investment

And its really to 90% just sending money to family and relatives still in Kosovo, so they can survive easily. Thats not building up a healthy economy. And they invest in building vacations houses in Kosovo but rarely factories or other businesses.

&gt;Of course. Job defines where you live but they eventually decide to come back. Kosovo is aleays the home of them. Not least because nobody in the west ever considers immigrants their own people, even with citizenship you are always a foreigner.

Rarely anyone comes back. Rarely. Though the rest is the first time in this discussion that i agree with you.

&gt;All that earned money eventually comes back. The problem is creating a better cooperstion with albania and creating a condition where people could be employed locally with european standards in workers rights and qualify of life.

Albania itself is in a bad state. We need to do also a lot of other cooperation with wealthy countries. That will improve Kosovo and Albania.

3436,"Grímsvötn (e. waters/lakes of Grímur or Grímur's lakes/waters) is an volcano under the largest glacier in Iceland, Vatnajökull (e. Waterglacier). It last erupted in 2011, a year after the infamous Eyjafjallajökull (e. Island-mountain-glacier) and it lasted for a week. Flights were affected by the 2011 eruption, about 900 flights were cancelled over the week. The namesake of the volcano is an outlaw named Grímur which is said to have lived there for a time. His story is found in old traditional stories (""folk"" stories) collected by Jón Árnason back in the 19th century. 

Lakagígar (e. craters of Laki or Laki's craters) is located in the same volcanic system as Grímsvötn. It is named after the mountain Laki, which in turn is named after on of the stomachs found in cows (e. omasum), which the mountain is said to look like. When Lakagígar erupted in 1783 it caused a mist which covered big parts of Iceland. For context there were six times more gas released than in the Mount Pinatubo 1991 eruption. To make bad things worse Grímsvötn also erupted at the same time. It caused widespread famine in Iceland which is known as Móðuharðindin (e. the mist hardship) which is estimated to have killed around 25% of Iceland's population. The effects of the eruption were not only found in Iceland but all over the world as the erupton is thought to have caused global temperature drop. The mist also covered parts of western Europe. It is believed that those two eruptions are one of a the causes for increase in poverty in France which ultimatly led to the French Revolution in 1789. 

That said, there are no indications of an eruption of the same scale happening now. This is just a fun fact (or ""not-so-fun"" fact) about the volcano and its system.

3485,"I’ve read some works by Orwell, including 1984, and what you’re doing, as well as what right wing nutjobs are doing when they masquerade their white supremacism behind phrases like “all lives matter” is both Orwellian. Justifying firing someone purely on the basis of him or her saying “all lives matter” is Orwellian because saying “all lives matter” is in itself not a racist or even controversial act. You want him or her to get fired simply because she or he doesn’t adhere to your ideological convictions. 

I agree that many people who say “all lives matter” are likely to harbor racist views and say it to fuel polarisation. I’m also sure, however, that many people who do this do not Harbor racist views. In the end, you can’t be sure what their motivations are and you can’t just fire someone because you’re convinced in advance that they are reactionary hatemongerers simply because they said “all lives matter”. What you do is Orwellian.

The idea is in fact so fucking ridiculous to fire somebody over “all lives matter” that right-wing people (racist or not) will probably use this statement just to undermine left-leaning narratives instead of making a concealed  racist statement And that’s a shame, because many of the ideas behind black lives matter and general left wing policies are essential to improve the societal differences that are often the result of racism. 

Firing people over “all lives matter” and calling for the “defunding of the police” are not helping and are only likely to dissuade Americans from supporting the otherwise righteous cause of fighting racism, inequality and police violence.

&gt;We have a huge high tech sector your acting like they just have a shell company here they use for taxes we have massive EU bases here and manufacturing and product creation 

""The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council (IFAC) warned on Thursday that the country’s economy has become so reliant on taxes paid by multinationals that half of all of corporate taxes paid in the nation come from just 10 global companies.""

&gt;But that talks about diversification of the sector rather than having it coming from a few big tech companies no where in there is it talking about half of the corporate tax coming from tax avoidance of those companies rather that we have massive Google and Facebook based here 

 **the country’s economy has become so reliant on taxes paid by multinationals that half of all of corporate taxes paid in the nation come from just 10 global companies.**

&gt;Look I get it you Google what you wanted to hear and just copy and pasted that without any actual understanding of it..which goes back to my earlier point about ignorance on this 

More ad hominems, I'm not under the impression Ireland doesn't have its own industries or cannot raise its own revenue, just that its *highly* dependant on multinationals encamping themselves in Ireland to sustain its current tax revenue, and a large part of that comes from multinationals doing tax avoidance. 

&gt;Nowhere did I say it's without criticism but your own citation piece undermines your entire point when it states that 12 other eu countries were like yea we don't want to go there when push came to shove. Ireland was an easy target to try recoup some of the tax avoidance their own loopholes caused 

Your entire premise is disingenious, I never said *only* Ireland was guilty of this, just that it *was* a glorified tax haven.

Your counter argument to that, your argument why immigration is a good thing, is that you got to eat some food.

So you're either supporting his argument in a very (unironically) impressive big-brain move of making a *terrible* counter-argument, or you think that those people getting stabbed doesnt even-out the scales of this discussion against the chance to eat Kebabs.

You probably still literally cant understand what I'm saying, because cognitive dissonance is a hell of a thing. So I will make an analogy that is less politically charged:

I think the driveways to hospitals should be non-parking zones. Just the other day, a patient in the back of an ambulance died because the ambulance was blocked from accessing the ER by parked cars.  
Your counter-argument is: I got to look at a beautiful firework in the park yesterday, because I parked in the hospital driveway. There was no other parking space free, for miles!

3558,"“Imagine if on Saturday evening a white neo-Nazi had stabbed three men to death. Imagine, furthermore, if in the wake of the killings it had turned out that all three of the victims were gay. Or ‘members of the LGBT community’, to use the lexicon of the time. And then imagine if two days later nobody in the UK or anywhere else was very interested in any of this. So what if the victims were all gay? Why bother sifting around for motives. What are you trying to say? Bigot.

Well something that might well be analogous to that happened in Reading on Saturday evening and over the days since.

On Saturday evening, Khairi Saadallah went on a stabbing spree in Forbury Gardens, Reading. His victims were three gay men, James Furlong, David Wails and Joe Ritchie-Bennett. It has since emerged that the 25-year old suspect, who is now in police custody, came to the UK from Libya in 2012. He is reported to have come to the attention of MI5 last year as an individual who had the potential to travel overseas for terrorism purposes. The Security Service apparently decided that he was not an immediate risk.

The families of Furlong, Wails and Ritchie-Bennett might beg to differ on that last point. But who knows. So far there has been almost no interest expressed in the possible motives of the attacker. Quite possibly there is a mental health component. In which case I would expect that to be looked into. Quite possibly there will be some drugs-related component. In which case I would expect the usual voices to demand an investigation into that. But anything else to see here? Any other reason why a migrant from Libya who was given asylum in the UK might want to go around stabbing gay men? Well who would even ask such questions? What do you want to find? Bigot.

So far the most analysis there has been has been to inform us all of the wonderfulness of the victims. We can learn that the victims were not just ‘proud gay men’ who attended Reading Pride, but that at least one of them – Furlong – was also ‘a strong advocate for the Black Lives Matter movement.’ Perhaps Saadallah didn’t get that memo. Perhaps if he had known how involved in social activism his victims were then he would have left them alone and stabbed some people who never much bothered with such things, or kept themselves to themselves.

For the BBC – among most other major news outlets – every question that this case throws up remains stubbornly unaddressed and unaddressable. On Monday night’s News at Ten, the BBC managed to talk about the three Reading victims without once saying that the police think they might have been targeted because they were gay. All that there was that nodded to that possibility was a tribute from someone who said that the victims were part of the LBGT community.

Why leave nearly all the analysis out? Of course there were will be a trial, the due process of the law and so on. But if the attacker from Saturday night had been a white skinhead, or a neo-Nazi or had been wearing a big red MAGA hat I am fairly confident that the gay press and all of the mainstream media would be crawling over every angle of this story by now with an unparalleled fury, hurling allegations of ‘adjacency’ against all of their favourite enemies. As it is I am reminded of nothing so much as story after story over recent years. Stories like when Omar Mateen walked into the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida four years ago and gunned down 49 people.

People know after a story like this that it isn’t good. They know that there’s more to say and doubtless more to see here. But they have made a very basic calculation. The calculation is that dead gays aren’t good. But they aren’t as bad – indeed they are a price worth paying – compared to asking any of the questions that sane people would ask after an attack like this. Sure we have a societal piety that is opposed to homophobia. But the societal piety which says that we should not risk ‘othering’ Libyan asylum seekers is stronger. The fear will be that talking about Islamic homophobia as a potential motive in this case might increase prejudice of some other kind. It's a calculation of a very cynical and inept kind.

That is why the media is silent on this. It's why the gay press is so muted. They are willing to take this sort of thing, absorb it and just hope it doesn’t happen too often. It’s a matter of hierarchies. And the gays aren’t as high up this one as people like to think.”",,/r/europe/comments/heedwv/what_isnt_being_said_about_the_reading_attack/fvqnuf5/,ApolloSminthos,1592918177

That's why he wrote: ""semi-official declarations signed by the highest officials of the German state"", which I lazily paraphrased.

&gt;Yes you cannot 100% take the people and the country independently. On the other hand, you cannot say that the country and the people are the same, which is what the author did. 

It's absolutely not what he did, it's what you want to read into it. It is pretty obvious that the author considers the holocaust to be a complex issue and that many actors, individuals, organizations, associations etc. were part of it or enabling it. This should be studied in detail.

Your point appears unnecessarily reductionist and you are basing solely on the quote from the Maas Wirsching article. If anything you should criticize that article for not differentiating between countries, people and ""Völker"". 

Now quoting from that article:
&gt;Geschichte prägt, wer wir sind, als Menschen, aber auch als Nationen. Umso wichtiger ist Aufrichtigkeit im Umgang mit ihr. Die deutsche Vergangenheit zeigt die Gefahr eines Revisionismus, der rationales Denken durch nationale Mythen ersetzt. Deshalb - und nicht etwa aufgrund vermeintlich moralischer Überlegenheit - sind gerade wir Deutschen gefordert, Stellung zu beziehen, wenn Angegriffene zu Angreifern gemacht werden und Opfer zu Tätern. [...] Wer daran Zweifel sät und andere Völker in eine Täterrolle drängt, der fügt den Opfern Unrecht zu. Der instrumentalisiert Geschichte und spaltet Europa.

You're also falling for the fallacy of generalizing data, of which you you don't know the priors. It is true that immigrants make up a larger share of criminals than natives, but that doesn't mean that all immigrants make up a larger share than all subsets of natives.

In a random check, you often can't control for these variables. If you only check the ticket of a person of color on a train, even if that person wears a suite, you're actually negating the priors (wealth in this case) and this shit happens all the time.

Being black doesn't make you more likely to ride the train without a ticket. It makes it more likely that you belong to a group that is more likely to ride the train without a ticket.

I can't speak for Nantes but Bordeaux was wealthy much before the slave trade. There a reason why it was such a hot topic during the Hundred Years War.

&gt;The French republic sees its territories as a unique entity (it is one of the most centralized countries): for e.g Algeria was a department. So the colonies were indeed part of France and such a law must apply in each colonies as for other laws. It was one Kingdom, then one Empire and then one Republic but two class citizens. This is to highlight the double standards used in France.

You're just spouting confused rubbish. Algeria was indeed made of **several** *départements* that became part of the French state. But that's an exception. The vast majority of the colonial empire has **never** been part of the French state but was under a variety of separate legal jurisdictions.

&gt;By the usage of such double standards, France can destroy Libya and continue fighting other colonial wars without any significant debate in the society.

Besides being confused nonsense, it's also completely besides the point and unrelated to thread.

3633,"You misrepresent the author's point. His starting point is not the article by Maas and Wirsching. Rather personal observations and interactions with German historians, as well as the reception of the Goldhagen book in Germany. Both these strains are concerned with the role of the German people. The article by Maas and Wirsching is according to the author ""one clear example that encapsulates the German problem with history"". 

His problem with this article is mostly that it offers other governments an out to claim that their people were only victims themselves and engage in ""historical distortion"" for nationalist purposes. These governments then proceed target independent scholars and historians. 

Furthermore he recognizes the unique (as in special) responsibility of Germany for the war and holocaust: ""There is absolutely no doubt (and I stress it very strongly) that the genocidal project was purely German, but one needs to also stress that this German project found very many willing partners and enablers all across occupied Europe.""

&gt;Yes even Poland (as the example of the country hit worst by WW2) should look at the crimes committed by the collaborators in their midst. Nobody in Germany will prevent them from doing it. But at the same time we won't do it for them.

That's the entire point of the article. German historians should not limit themselves to analysing the role of Germany/ German population in the holocaust. This limitation would not be so bad if it stayed in the academic sector, but as the author describes once the idea that only Germany and Germans are to blame becomes official policy, it can have negative impacts in other countries. Personally, I would argue that such a limitation makes no scientific sense and afaik doesn't exist for any other historic periods or events.

What is your point here? I wouldn't call 90-95% European very multicultural, especially not where the ethnicities present are traditionally seen as part of the national identity. F.e. I don't think it's accurate to call Switzerland or Belgium multicultural simply because there are multiple national ethnicities living there, as multiculturalism is more than just that. Otherwise we come to the strange conclusion that all of human history except for the rather brief period in which nation-states with monocultures were the norm in Europe (barely 200 years), we were 'multicultural'. Because the historical norm is that empires consisted of many different localised cultures and ethnicities until the concept of the nation-state spurred Europeans to teach all of the country one language and one set of national values, cultivating a national identity instead of a localised one. Nor does it seem accurate to call European countries 'multicultural' simply due to historical migrations within Europe. At that point we might as well say that no homogenous nations even exist.

3912,"Addressing a crowd of 200 supporters in a cobbled square near a church in the medieval city of Torun, Robert Biedron, a candidate in next Sunday’s Polish presidential election, held up a Bible in his right hand.
“All the other candidates are running to become Poland’s bishop, not its president,” he shouted to the largely youthful crowd. Then he revealed a copy of the country’s constitution in his other hand, declaring: “For me this is the guide.”
Talk of breaking down the close relationship between church and state is one of the main demands of the 44-year-old leftwinger who last week took his election campaign to the country’s conservative heartland.
Atheist and openly gay, Biedron is anathema to the ruling right-wing Law and Justice Party (PiS).
PiS along with state media and leaders of the Catholic church have long depicted LGBT people as “paedophiles”, a “rainbow plague”, a “threat to the nation”, “sodomites”, “not equal to normal people” and “vampires”. Almost 100 communities and cities have declared themselves “LGBT-free zones”.
Yet for many youngsters in the crowd in Torun, Biedron is the next great hope for Poland after 15 years of conservative rule either by PiS or the more economically liberal Civic Platform, which was led by Donald Tusk before he left for Brussels to become president of the European Council.
“I don’t remember life without either of them,” said Stanislaw, 19. “Change is needed and it is personified by Biedron. His ideas on the economy, marriage equality and the secular state mean he’s the only person I can vote for with a clear conscience.”
Biedron is outspoken, eloquent and passionate. When his party, Wiosna (Spring), was launched at a dazzling event in Warsaw in February last year, it aspired to win at least 10% of votes. Biedron himself drew comparisons to Emmanuel Macron, the French president.
But he is also prone to gaffes, as he showed when twice in his speech he confused Torun with Poznan, 100 miles to the southwest. And his party suffers from the bane of Polish politics — jealousy and leadership squabbles.
Support for Wiosna slumped in the months after it began, and in last October’s parliamentary election it won seats only thanks to an alliance with two other parties under the Lewica (Left) alliance. Together they received 12.6% of the vote; on its own, Wiosna would have struggled to cross the 5% threshold required to enter parliament.
Despite the youthful energy around Biedron, polls suggest he is unlikely to get more than 2%-5% in a crowded field of 11 candidates for president — a post that, although largely ceremonial, gives the incumbent the power to veto laws.
Most likely to go forward to the second round on July 12 are Andrzej Duda, the incumbent president who is backed by PiS, and Rafal Trzaskowski, 48, the centrist, pro-European Warsaw mayor chosen at the last moment as the presidential candidate for Civic Platform.

Biedron hopes to benefit at the polls by pitting himself against attempts by PiS to rally its conservative-minded supporters with calls for traditional family values and opposition to LGBT rights.
Depicting himself as the face of an open-minded, liberal and tolerant Poland, Biedron protested vociferously when Duda recently declared LGBT to be an “ideology” worse than Soviet-era communist indoctrination. “They try to convince us that these are people, but it is simply an ideology,” the outgoing president claimed, inviting accusations — which he denied — that he was dehumanising members of the LGBT community.
Wojciech Klabun, a PiS member of Torun city council, insists the party is not against gays and lesbians. “We just represent and voice the conservative attitude of the majority of the Polish society,” he said. Biedron was unfit to be president, not because of his sexual orientation, but rather because of his “radical left turn, which has negligible supporters and is artificially pumped by some media”, Klabun added.
For critics, the issue is a useful tool for PiS to divert attention from criticism of its handling of the coronavirus crisis, power struggles within its ranks and financial scandals involving leading politicians.
“Due to the lack of a different strategy and skills, they have long spread fear; against migrants, the European Union and later LGBT,” said Mariusz Godlejewski, a chef who is the co-organiser of LGBT Pride in Torun.
Although he is still a supporter of Biedron, Godlejewski doubts the candidate is in a strong enough position to take on PiS. “Too much PR, marketing and strategy have influenced the behaviour of Biedron,” who over the months has seemingly lost his naturalness and charm, he said.
“I doubt if PiS’s attack on LGBTQ will save Biedron,” agreed Michal Syska, co-founder of Wiosna, who left the party last summer due to “the discrepancy between the positive image and undemocratic way of managing based purely on Robert’s will”.
The election will instead, Syska believes, mark the end of Biedron as a political leader, who, he says, surrounds himself with young people who “treat him like a guru”.
Yet, as he demonstrated with his performance in Torun, Biedron does not lack charisma. Supporters reacted with enthusiasm when he urged them to “throw off the shackles of the 15-year rule of the right”— and then, as if he were a pop star, escorted him to a nearby bakery to sample the city’s famous gingerbread.",,/r/europe/comments/he8don/polands_youth_backs_gay_atheist_robert_biedron/fvpr9xz/,casualphilosopher1,1592889650

3995,"The popular myth is actually way overstating T-34\KV superiority. In terms of armor and firepower these vehicles were certainly among the best, but they were less reliable, had subpar radios and observation. Furthermore, short KwK 37 L/24 was much better in direct infantry support than the array of soviet 76\57mm cannons mounted on their tanks. PzKpwf III and IV both were able to take on T-34s with HEAT and APDS rounds, while the Soviets had problems with the quality of their own AP\APHE ammo until late 1943, and especially in 1941-42 (pretty much *all 76mm AP ammo* was below designed factory-standard penetration values). Once IV-F2\G came into the play (with KwK 40 L/43 and L/48), the times became quite sad for T-34 and KV indeed.

Furthermore, in terms of doctrine, PzKpfw III-IV were used primarily in support role (Tank Corps had more infantry than tanks, and was primarily designed around mobile combined arms *kampfgruppen* rather than hordes of tanks as commonly imagined). The primary weapon against soviet tanks were organic Anti-Tank Artillery units of Infantry divisions. PaK 38 was well able to stop Soviet tanks at normal combat ranges, and considering that most T-34s were like blind kittens, especially when cut off their infantry support, they were destroyed very rapidly.

Finally, main tank of the Red Army in June 1941 was neither T-34 nor KV - those were T-26 and BT-7 of Western District armies, which were used to full effect in the [steel triangle of Dubno-Lutsk-Brody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_wZvEDuXsw) (the actual largest tank battle in history, June 23-30 1941), where most of them were destroyed.",The other Galicia,/r/europe/comments/hdpqph/on_this_day_in_1941_began_operation_barbarossa/fvpggli/,Strydwolf,1592882176

4003,""" from the lower classes should be able to afford both higher education and healthcare?""

In many cases they can, also many college aid programs are set up specificly for low income.  

In the US there is diversity and that is a two edged sword.  There are many different possibilities and you need to seek out ones that work for you.  Some people fall thru the cracks but many people live happier more productive lives.  

People from outside the US frequently look at the worst case scenario and assume that is the case for most or all.  Actually it is just that, worst case, many or most people tend to be better off and some are much better off.  

I used to live in Germany and almost everyone had a comfortable standard off living but there are things I can do here that I could not do there.  For example I am just a basic middle class guy but I own a house on a lake and have a boat and can easily hunt and fish and the government largely leaves me alone.  That would be harder to do in Germany although yes I would be comfortable.  

Also we are in a different boat in the sense that people from all over the globe commonly come here and they have been for centuries now.  If Europe is going to continue taking in anyone that shows up from anywhere on the globe you will learn that your minimum looks pretty good to a lot of them.  

Then your productive people will have to work to support many more people at the minimum and you will find that it is not so easy to keep it going.  Then you run into the situation like Stuttgart or Nantes where the first generation might be happy with the minimum since they remember the old country.  However, their kids will look around and want a lot more than the minimum but they may well not have either the ability or work ethic to get it and then you have problems like Nantes and Stuttgart.  

There are billions of people on earth and the population has more than doubled during my lifetime and is if anything accelerating.  You can not take everyone in and have a good social safety net.

That is not what their neighbors and our neighbors think.

"" neither is strong enough to be independent.""
that is my point, if we were imperialistic we could drum up some excuse and invade.  We don't.  As we speak, russia is occupying Ukraine and many smaller countries like Finland is threateed by it.  

China is occupying Tibet and Mongolia.  They are taking small pieces of land from India which is what they are currently fighting over.  china is also occupying small artificial islands in the South China sea to take resources from the Phillipines.  

The US is not doing that to its neighbors.  again they look to us for defense, they do not look to others to help them defend their countries  from us.

Also, the US never tried to invade Canada.  When we fought that was long ago and Canada did not have independence from the UK.  We did invade Mexico but that was a long time ago, before for example Germany unified as a nation.  Things have changed on both sides of the ocean.

However, differences are more visible among people aged 65 and over. In the EU, four in ten women (40%) live alone compared to 19% of men. These people might have been facing particular difficulties in daily life resulting from social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic.

**National elementary education law of 1924. 06. 26.**

 By which people of Romanian origin despite not knowing Romanian had to be educated in Romanian. How someone was determined to have Romanian origin was completely arbitrary. Same law provided land and extra salary for teachers coming from Old Romania to settle in so called ""culture zones"", regions inhabited by non-Romanians in other word.

Speaking of lands, estates of churches which financed national minority education were taken away.

**""Private education law"" of 1928. 05. 15.** forced remaining religious schools to continue education in Romanian.

Tax raise of Transylvanian counties of 1924. That was a raise of 70%, but was higher if the county had a Hungarian majority.

Public signs had to be in Romanian, bilingual signs were banned, Hungarian location names had to be written in Romanian even in the Hungarian press.

**Baccalaurate law of 1925. 03. 07.**. Final exams had to be taken in Romanian. Higher education attendance became barricated by Romanian language knowledge. Besides it was immediately introduced causing non-Romanian pupils to get locked out from education for the up coming years. But not just them, craftsmen also could not work like that.

 Same period, Romania banned pursuit of founding university for national minority education. 

Double taxation for non-Romanian theathers. Discrimination of Hungarian banks.

Laws, administration, juridiction, officiers, state schools,  were only in Romanian.

**Numerus valachicus.** Quotas on universities.

**About the protection of the work of the nation Law of 1934. 06. 16.** Which stated the staff of business companies had to be 80% Romanian, the executives had to be 50% Romanian, and as for the rest they have to have Romanian wife and mutual children.

 1937.05.09. Numerus nullus. Lawyers can be only of Romanian ethnicity.

""population redistribution"", propaganda of ""Hungarianized Romanians"", jailing people for singing, playing the wrong song, closed cities from Hungarians to settle, Hungarian quotas in factories, ""ethnical spreading"" settling higher educated Hungarians into lands of old Romania, selling out Germans from the country and replacing them with Romanians. Settling masses of Romanians into Translyvania from the 1970's, almost never persecuting the Romanian Orthodox church or its figures, while keeping other churches under terror, censorship, requiring classes to have 36 pupils, so that minority schools of small villages had to be closed, Romanianization of surnames, require pupils to specialize in fields, but not providing conditions to specialize using minority language, no teacher for minority language education,""in Romania everyone is Romanian"", replacing historical coats of arms, renaming localities to manipulate perception, cultural isolation policy: blocking distorting Hungarian media, phone calls, censoring mail, prohibiting accomodating ""foreigners"", but not if they had alleged Romanian origin, blocking international travel.

Here is a [lengthy article](https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/when-britain-becomes-majority-minority) he wrote about it in 2010 with various models of when it will happen based on levels of migration. 

Net immigration levels have increased since the article was penned, so it could happen somewhat sooner than expected. According to the Office of National Statistics figures, of live births in 2018 59.5% were white British and that number has been decreasing by approximately 1% each year, so that gives you an idea of the demographic trajectory of the country going into the future. 

It's also worth noting that the average age of the white British population is about 42, considerably past childbearing age while the minority populations are much younger on average. So, as older white Brits die off in 20-40 years and the current non-white youth start raising families our demographics will shift dramatically; which is compounded by the fact that minorities have considerably higher fertility rates.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/hdpdzu/opinion_poll_next_french_presidential_election_le/fvp324u/,Casri_,1592874217

These riots are caused by to a certain degree, by blind fucks who cant sperate reality from outrage induced falsehoods.

What doesnt change is that one can only statisticaly value current life quality compared to historic values of life quality.

They dont even notice it as in all thier rage against the wrong people, they forget what they preach. In the end, its a bunch of unorganized rioters of all generations who simply cant factcheck. Something you get teached in school ffs. These people are the ones who dont, ever, listen. Ever. Its funny, and grim.

You do not know much about European history.  Go visit one of the American cemeteries in Europe and you can see how much if benefited the US.

Look at history, we do not roll into places and take them over like China or Russia do.  If we do militarily take over, we return control to local population as soon as possible.  Look at Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea and for that matter Denmark if you want to know how that works.  That is the way it works everywhere in the Middle East and Africa and South Asia as well and Europe benefits more from stability in those areas than the US does.  Just as one obvious example, would you prefer ISIS to still have its caliphate?  If it did do you think you would be seeing more or fewer new faces on the streets of Denmark?  Do you think you would have more or fewer SJWs coming for opportunities to kill kafirs in Denmark?  The reality is that if the Americans did not come to Europe you would be either a NAZI or a communist right now and you would not be allowed to post your thoughts freely on the internet.  If you want, we can talk about how long Denmark held out, fighting the NAZI's and if you had faced Stalin he would have been stronger still.

As for Ramstein it is primarily a runway.  Just like we shut down Rhein Main we can shut it down and we can find a more reliable ally to put it in.  As for Landstuhl we are there because it was a large Luftwaffe Hospital during WWII.  I have been treated there and it may well be time to build newer facilities in a more stable ally.

If you think the US treats its allies bad, try asking Russia or China's neighbors how they do things.  I live an hour from the Canadian border.  It is the longest undefended border in the world.  Our neighbors look to us for defense instead of to others for defense from us.

I agree that the US facilities serve US interests first and foremost but that does not mean they do not serve yours as much or even far more.  My life would be just fine if the US had never gone to Europe.

4236,"&gt;No healthy economy would ever allow this. Look at China for example. They started producing their own stuff in almost every branch of the economy.

Who told you China is a ""healthy economy""? Serbia is literally a more productive economy than China on a per capita basis already so why should Serbia look up to China? You mistake size for prosperity.

And no they haven't. China is mostly manufacturing, construction, and technology. China is nowhere near a self-sufficient nation. They are the largest food importer in the world. 

&gt;This helps their economy big time because money stays in the state

The economy is not a zero-sum game. The healthiest economies in the world are all industrialized nations with a liberal stance to free trade.

An open world with free trade allows nations to produce their comparative advantage, and a world where every nation does that is a hundred times richer per capita than a world were all countries closed their borders and had to create everything themselves. I'm not saying it isn't good to be self-sufficient in some areas, but fact is that [less than 10% of world population is anymore in extreme poverty thanks to globalism, this is down from 50% just 40 years ago](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rafael_Ale-Ruiz/publication/322288633/figure/fig1/AS:581175596814337@1515574468506/Share-of-the-world-population-living-in-absolute-poverty-1820-2015-Source-Our-World-in.png). Globalism is just as big a deal of positive change as the industrial revolution.

4267,"&gt; Not wanting to be nuked by lunatics because they cannot stand you having freedom of speech in your own country is not extremism

The ""they hate our freedom"" part is almost equally laughable as ""freedom fries"" and ironically both are coined by the same guy who can't pronounce nuclear.   
   
Yes, they hate your freedom to go to their neighborhood, patronize them and start wars, surround their country with a dozen military bases (to defend against ""their aggression"") or arm/support/fund terrorist groups for regime change and threaten their regimes if you don't want them to come to your country and nuke you. I think that's fair. However, had the playing field been level with both sides having the ability to destroy each other instead of just one side (like the US vs Russia), then both sides will show respect to each other (or you get nuked and believe me, these regimes won't mess around - they'll fire because they'll go to heaven if they die fighting for their freedom).  
   
&gt;I never said I that I support Western interventionism; you are simply concocting a straw man here of the ""evil West"" bullying and destroying the entire world.   
   
I'm talking about the Western regimes, or the ""Western liberal order of the past 70 years"" as Rothschild, Agnelli families, Cadbury and Shroder Layton's publication ""[The economist](https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2017/09/21/the-liberal-order-of-the-past-70-years-is-under-threat) calls it. And their proponents.   
   
As long as they think this their world order and try to enforce it with nukes, the opposition should and will have access to them too.   
   
Either that or all sides should be banned from having them so nobody can have them. Isn't that fair for you? So nobody has reason to fear becoming the victim of a genocide by nukes.   
  
&gt;Not wanting to be a victim of a genocide because someone said something that offended someone on the other side of the world is now equal to slavery?   
   
You're obviously buying too much propaganda from your regime and their propaganda arm (mainstream media). But that's good so maybe you'll feel and understand how they feel (of not wanting to be a victim of a genocide) everytime the US/West thinks those countries need ""democracy"". So it's fair they have the bomb too so both sides can understand the feeling and sincerely put an effort to eliminate the nukes so NOBODY has it. It only has to be fair.

4276,"&gt;It was definitely more liberal than what the Soviets had.

It eventually became that way after the Tito/Stalin split. But the split began primarily because Tito wanted to keep fighting after WWII and keep the revolution going. Stalin wanted time to regroup and recover after the war's catastrophic losses, and was worried about not upsetting the percentages agreements he had reached with the Western powers. That is how Hebrang (who was not as hardcore as Tito when it came to regionalization and church-state relations) lost his life. He was thought to be Stalin's choice to replace Tito once he was removed.

See, e.g., Wikipedia on the Tito/Stalin rift:

&gt;The scholar Perović considered the cause to be Stalin's rejection of Tito's plans to absorb the [People's Republic of Albania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Socialist_Republic_of_Albania) and the [Kingdom of Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Greece) in cooperation with the [People's Republic of Bulgaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_Bulgaria), thereby setting up a powerful Eastern European bloc outside Moscow's control which would be known as the [Balkan Federation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkan_Federation).",,/r/europe/comments/hdqt9z/on_this_day_croatia_marks_antifascist_struggle/fvos4fh/,_kasten_,1592867954

Look at US bases in Germany.

They have military hospitals here ... whenever they rescue an American from somewhere, they get first treatment there. It's in a well developed and safe place, and much nearer to their war places (middle east) than the USA. Oh, and for this they have airbases here, too.

They operate a good bunch of their drones with the wedding seeking hellfire missiles from Germany. For their own programme of ""let's rise the next terrorist generation"".

The US EUCOM is based in Germany, they lead and run ""Enduring Freedom"" (supposedly war against terrorism) from there.

Nothing of this is NATO, nothing of this is to ""protect Europe from the commies"". It's here in Germany because it's near to their war theatre, because it's useful, because Germany isn't in the position to say ""No!"" despite almost everyone here hating the USA dealing out death verdicts by missiles from our soil.

The USA now has around 33'000 soldiers in Germany. It's pathetic to assume that such a small number of to protect us against the ""Evil Russian Bear"". They only have this small number here because a) something like EUCOM consists mostly of brass and b) the hellfire terrorism to other countries is highly technic.

4561,"As far as I know Croatians as a people contributed the most to the Anti-Fascist movement in the Former Yugoslavia during WWII. Even Tito himself was half-Croat half Slovene.

I feel the need to comment about this as since the breakup of Yugoslavia there has been a terrible amount of propaganda (mainly generated by Serb Nationalists) that all Croats are blood thirsty monsters because of the actions of the Ustase puppet state.

What they don't mention though is that during WWII Serbia was also a Nazi Puppet state in which Serb collaborationist forces fought side by side with the Germans against Anti-Fascists (in even many of the royalist Chetnik militias allied with the Nazis). Belgrade was also the first city in Europe to be declared Judenfrei.

My own people (Bosniaks) recently have been guilty of spewing the same nonsense as well. Despite the fact that more Bosniaks fought for Nazi collaborationist forces (it's a complicated story but I can elaborate on that later) than for the Partizans. Funny thing is out of all the Ex-Yu countries today the only one's that are true liberal democracies are Slovenia and Croatia.

Bosnia and Serbia on the other-hand are probably amongst the most right-wing xenophobic/homophobic/racist countries on the continent.

I am pretty sure an LGBT person would have a better time living in Croatia than Bosnia or Serbia where wife-beating is almost a national sport. What I am getting at here is that True Anti-Fascism can't just be confined to WWII. It's an everlasting process. I mean nowadays you even have Right wing dictatorships like Russia claiming that Ukraine is a neo-nazi shithole despite the fact that they overwhelmingly elected a Jewish President and had a Jewish prime minister for a long time. What has Russia done since WWII? Oh yeah arrest and torture gay people..

just to clarify I am not trying to say Croatia is an amazing place. But compared to other Ex-Yu countries it has more of it's shit together.

4582,"&gt;CNN poll shows what Black Britons have long known – from policing to politics, their country has failed them  
&gt;  
&gt;London — The outpouring of pent-up frustration about racism in the United Kingdom caught many White people by surprise.  
&gt;  
&gt;Who did not think the country had made big strides towards tolerance and equal opportunity over the past few decades?  
&gt;  
&gt;Who was concerned that statues of slave traders still stood in towns and cities across the union?  
&gt;  
&gt;Who questioned whether Black Lives Matter in Britain?  
&gt;  
&gt;The answer: Many, many Black people, whose views of race and racism in the UK are profoundly different from those of most White people, according to a sweeping and exclusive new CNN/Savanta ComRes poll.  
&gt;  
&gt;Black people are at least twice as likely as White people to say there is discrimination in British policing and media; three times as likely to think the country has done far too little to address historic racial injustice; and significantly more likely to believe that the country’s governing Conservative Party is institutionally racist.  
&gt;  
&gt;CNN and Savanta ComRes surveyed 1,535 British adults aged 18 and up online from June 12-14, including at least 500 Black and other ethnic minority respondents.

Every jailed political figure is a provoked protest action. Even from [controlled media](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/10/russian-papers-join-forces-in-solidarity-with-detained-journalist-ivan-golunov).

Every ""suicide"" of a journalist or politician also provokes a shitstorm not only [inside the country](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-31677506), but also [outside](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/02/24/europe/boris-nemtsov-plaza-russian-embassy-prague-intl/index.html). 

It is much easier to fabricate millions of cases, drag people to the courts and morally pressure them. Force them to spend money on lawyers, spend months in the courts - until they break down and give up their opposition activities. Give instructions to paid journalists to blackpaint images of people on the Internet. State-owned TV channels should completely refuse to discuss oppositionists', so that the elderly electorate does not even know about the existence of individual oppositionists.

The main reason for the large number of prisoners:

* Echo of the nineties. [Ten years ago, the number of prisoners was higher by **a third**. In zero - almost twice as much](https://www.prisonstudies.org/country/russian-federation). Literally millions of people in the 90s lost their sources of income and went into organized crime as a solution to their problems. 

* War on drugs. A quarter of all prisoners are jailed for drug crimes. Most are for consumption, not distribution.

* Economic crimes are also responsible for about a quarter of prisoners. Bribes, bribes, ransoms, fraud. When the whole system is so corrupt that even [IKEA is forced to make ""donations""](https://www.alaco.com/our-insight/intelligence/ikeas-troubled-history-in-russia) to open its store - be sure, the country will be full of economic crimes among the population. And these are small-scale crimes - the damage from them goes for hundreds and, rarely, thousands of dollars. In the EU, such crimes are simply limited to fines. In Russia - a prison term.

* Recidivism. Not as high as the US, but not as low as in the EU. The prison system is still built not on the principle of ""fix and release"", but ""isolate and forget"".",I want an Arkhangelsk' flair,/r/europe/comments/hdsznj/prison_population_rate_in_europe_2018/fvn69sk/,FlairWoW,1592838626

4679,"&gt; If the bar was ""don't do things that Russia doesn't like"", Europe would be a very different place. 

Luckily that isn't the bar. 

There is a difference between things that are imperative to Russia and things that are not liked or strategically problematic for it. It is imperative to Russia to retain a strong presence in the Black Sea, after it has already gradually lost a lot of its influence with every step of NATO extending. I'd consider the Russian strategy in Ukraine as failed - if their strategy was to preserve as much influence in the region as possible while binding Ukraine and other former soviet republics as closely as possible - with the Revolution in 2014, after all allies don't like to pushed around to much (take note US), the annexation of Crimea was the last resort before losing almost all strategic influence in the Black Sea. Now they're trying to hinder Ukraine's development with the proxy-war in Donbas. 

Strategically I don't think that it makes much sense to completely ignore Russias proper interests. There is a small line between admitting to Russias demands and making a fool of yourself and respecting the security priorities Russia has an independent country. Europe should stand with Ukraine, especially with the war in the East but I believe that Crimea is pretty much the top-priority of Russia in the Region and starting with the demand to hand back Crimea won't bring us anywhere.  The West should deploy force in the East - if wanted by Ukraine - but Crimea should be deferred to another time.",,/r/europe/comments/hdjzaa/president_of_ukraine_we_seek_full_membership_of_eu/fvn7isi/,frederiiiiik,1592839290

In contrast, the UK decreed a far milder lockdown on the 23 of march, with over 10.000 cases confirmed in the UK alone.

The country Russia invaded and partially annexed. That violence wasn't because Georgia was scary but because Russia could get away with it.  


&gt;Most of those ""peaceful countries"" you're talking about (provided that we are still talking in context of Europe) sent their troops to Iraq, not to mention the participation of European troops in various conflicts across the world. One must be hard pressed to find a truly peaceful country in Europe (Ireland/Iceland maybe?). Violence can be and is used for geopolitical goals. There is nothing wrong with that, except for those on the receiving end   

Peaceful among themselves, that is the EU and Russia aren't at war with each other. I included Russia in that group by saying among so naturally  I'm not talking about general peacefulness (and some  EU countries are actually quite peaceful).  


&gt;Ukraine is not going to join Russia. Grandpa does not even want Donbass, evidently. They just don't know what to do with the land and the people.   

It's not smooth sailing but yeah I do think grandpa (you mean Putin, right?) does want Ukraine. Not even for himself but just to give the impression before voters that Russia is ""winning"" and growing. That's a classic say to pander to nationalistic feelings and  these kind of annexations have been a staple for Russian foreign policy all the way back to the Russian Empire.   

&gt;Belarus is another matter entirely. I don't think that a forceful takeover of Minsk is gonna be popular with the Russian public. I can only hope that I'm not wrong about that.  

Why not?  This is what nationalists want. It's not even unique to Russia or anything, many countries have a ""Greater X"" dream and Russia is more imperialistic than most. It's not hard to see how joining Belarus would be played as a national success and pride by the media. Plus it's not necessarily about what makes sense it's about what Putin thinks makes sense. He had his ratings jump with the Crimea annexation, he sees Erdogan  getting good reception from his Syria invasion, Bush got a jump initially from the Iraq war, Xi seems to be angling for confrontations with HK, Taiwan and India  to distract  from the weaker economy, so Putin has good reason to think another war would help his ailing popularity. It would take a lot of wars for Russians to get tired of them like Americans have and if Russian media can present them as victories rather than the waste  of lives and money US wars are seen as, voters may not get tired at all. Biggest obstacles in front of Putin IMO is that annexing either Belarus or Ukraine would be difficult even if they are much weaker and would bring Russia harsher sanctions.",Bulgaria,/r/europe/comments/hdjzaa/president_of_ukraine_we_seek_full_membership_of_eu/fvmk754/,ZmeiOtPirin,1592823841

Firs part: It's message rotates around an example of a communist leader in Czechoslovakia, who was executed (along with 13 others) in 1952. [Wiki link](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Sl%C3%A1nsk%C3%BD). His last words were ""I deserve it"". Heavily debated in its meaning over the years. 

My take on that is that it's about enacting change that reeks all too well and familiar of devolving into something worse. (disregarding the unnecessarily dismissive and overly complex rhetoric). ""Game of decreasing"" or ""Decreasing theory"" is kind of a core of its whole argument. I haven't been able to find anything with that name in either languages. The idea being, that to govern and stay in power, you have to get the lowest classes on your side. Populism, anyone? I don't know. Devolution of political discourse and it's quality to make it relatable to them. 

The latter two pages get more into the technicalities of Minneapolis and its goal to completely reshuffle its policing. Lots of statistics, explaining differences between Europe and US, calling the murder ""an absolute excess"".

If one of the author's goals was for the reader audience to understand their message, then I think they failed. It's an interesting article, no doubt but it's very heavy on big words, mixed with poetic language and overall /r/increasinglyverbose feel.

The country with the most km of railway networks per one million people is Sweden, with 1,382. (about 14,000km in total).

Among countries with a railway network:

The country with the least km of railway network per one million people is Monaco, with 44km per one million people (1.7 in total).

Not counting microstates, it is Turkey, with about 125km per one million people (about 10,300km in total).

I don't particularly see any reason for that to happen.  In the short term, Russia has a larger arsenal.  In the long term, the EU has a larger economy.  You have arms races when the balance of power resting upon those arms is at stake.  Ukraine's membership in the EU does not alter the balance of nuclear power.

You may be thinking of Putin talking a while back, about a collection of nuclear weapons that he's theoretically going to build to use against the US.  In that case, Russia is losing her former position in the previous nuclear balance of power between Russia and the US, because the US has replaced her warheads and put out interceptors such that the US may now have first-strike capability against Russia today.

5027,"&gt; These are rather rare cases where private and personal property mix.

Well, I guess you've never been to the Balkans and Eastern Europe.

Also, there are plenty of these ""rare"" cases where the economy is not capitalist &gt; worker related. In a company you can have various TLs, department chiefs, IT staff etc. basically people that have a responsibility over people inside the same company, and the whole ""exploiter&gt;exploited"" narrative of Marx is just an oversimplification of the whole situation.

Yes, there is quite a number of people on entry-level positions (which you can refer to as ""workers"") and you can argue that there is a rather smaller number of people getting only the profit - i.e. the stakeholders - and let's maybe put the CEO there as well since he is not liable to anyone (except for the stakeholders maybe) - for the sake of your theory let's consider them ""the capitalists"".

But the relationship between these people is not a direct one, and maybe these people might not be from the same company anymore.

And how do you determine the right amount of value their work created so you can justify they are not paid properly? What's the amount from the whole profit necessary for rewarding anyone involved in the production process? Does anyone create the same value so you can justify the fact they are overpaid or underpaid?

5109,"&gt; You used distinct specially chosen time frames to advance your view rather than the whole picture. 

No, I used '95-'18 because that's the period that the WB/OECD have complete data for. It's more than enough for this exercise - business cycles are 10-12 years. Indeed the Baltics had a contraction in '99.

&gt; Blanchard may not be a fan of austerity but his research showed it ended up with better results sooner. 

How kind of you to interpret his results for him. You should write to him so he can thank you! Seriously though, it's a single case study of a country responding to a pre-crisis internal policy challenge. Latvia underperforms relative to Estonia, who kept a control of their deficits, and Lithuania, who clearly didn't, both in terms of return to real GDP and paying down their debts.  


&gt; The Greek issue was that they only did 10% of what was asked. It wasn't until 2015 where they were finally forced to implement larger changes. And by 2017 things were actually starting to improve. 

No, the Greek issue was the troika imposed austerity on them while their economy was still contracting. It exacerbated the recession, which is why in 2017, when you think ""things are starting to improve"" they're still at only 75% of their pre-crisis real GDP while the other six are north of 95%, lead by Lithuania on 112% (Latvia is \~100%). And for all that, Greek debt-to-GDP is still higher and pushing Japan-like levels. Even the IMF have admitted that they were wrong to force Greece into austerity.  


If by ""the fiscal four"" you mean ""the frugal four"" - Austria, Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden - they were all running comparably high (by their historical standards and Estonia's) deficit-to-GDP ratios until after they'd recovered to their pre-crisis GDP levels. In Sweden's case 4 years after. So their ""austerity"" looks a bit weak sauce. They all have higher debt-to-GDP ratios than prior to the crisis and haven't paid down as much as Lithuania, as a percentage of the peak. They're not good examples of effective austerity programs.   


Don't get me wrong, you and I agree on the need for the PIGS to get their debt under control in the long term and that it's a moral hazard for them to leverage the Eurozone like this. It's all a question of timing. And Greece clearly demonstrates that time is not in the middle of a recession, a recession that was longer and delayed them paying down their debt further, because of the austerity measures.  


You're throwing out a lot of countries here, trying to find examples of effective austerity programs leading to better recoveries but not many numbers, I notice. Could it be -  


&gt;a pathetic attempt to avoid looking at real world data.

5172,"&gt; No, the Greek issue was the troika imposed austerity on them while their economy was still contracting. It exacerbated the recession, which is why in 2017, when you think ""things are starting to improve"" they're still at only 75% of their pre-crisis real GDP while the other six are north of 95%, lead by Lithuania on 112% (Latvia is ~100%). And for all that, Greek debt-to-GDP is still higher and pushing Japan-like levels. Even the IMF have admitted that they were wrong to force Greece into austerity.

Exactly and if the Greeks had actually got on to the reforms back in 2009 they would have started improving by 2011.

Their delays and obstafication were the problem. Once they actually started to make the reforms things improved. Its nice you think just throwing money at an economy will magically make things better but its being shown time and time again it the basis of the economy not how much you borrow.

The point is that you think throwing money is just the magical fix  Austerity is not just cutting but a path way back to fiscal health. This does not happen by just borrowing more money. Japan shows how that plan fails.

5207,"&gt; IQ is partialy heritable but there's no evidence it's heritability is different in different populations as your framing might suggest.

&gt;If scientific mainstream sees no difference in heritability regarding IQ of different groups but potentialy on individual members

What you wrote here means in English: Group A's cognition is X% heritable, Group B's cognition is Y% heritable, and X ≠ Y. This isn't what I said, however.

My position is that Group A and Group B both have cognition that is X% heritable. In other words, both groups are equally likely to pass the same traits to their kids. However, that doesn't mean that their starting points are necessarily equal. The average IQ of Whites is set at 100, for East Asians it's a bit above, for Jews higher still, whereas for Amerindians, South Asians, and Arabs it's a bit lower, for Sub-Saharan Africans it's lower still, and for Australian Aborigines it's even lower. You can look at it with higher resolution by studying individual countries, regions or ethnic groups, but the trend remains the same, with just small differences among similar groups. Importantly, this aspect is not widely disputed in the scientific literature. What is disputed is the origin, but as I said, the view is starting to form that it's a mix of both genetics and environment because both arguments seem to be right. So, for example, we could (and probably should) devote resources to help Africans, Arabs and so on in Europe and North America integrate into society, help them escape poverty, etc., but it's a fool's errand to expect that their outcomes in terms of salary, education, criminality, etc will reach the same levels as the native population. Even if racism, discrimination and so on could be totally removed (there will probably always be some, but let's say in theory), the gaps would still persist, just not as large as they are now.",Canada (Ethnic European),/r/europe/comments/hd29b4/germany_riots_and_looting_grip_stuttgart/fvlqr2j/,Garlic_Fingering,1592797562

5235,"In 2019, price levels for consumer goods and services differed widely in the European Union of 27 Member States (EU).

Denmark (141% of the EU average) had the highest price level, followed by Ireland (134%), Luxembourg (131%), Finland (127%) and Sweden (121%).

At the opposite end of the scale, the lowest price levels were found in Bulgaria (53%) and Romania (55%). In other words, price levels for consumer goods and services in the EU varied by almost one to three between the cheapest and the most expensive Member State.

**Food price levels highest in Denmark, lowest in Romania**

In 2019, the price level of a comparable basket of food &amp; non-alcoholic beverages across the EU was almost twice as high in the most expensive Member State as in the cheapest one. Price levels ranged from 66% of the EU average in Romania and 70% in Poland, to 129% of the average in Denmark, followed by Luxembourg and Austria (both 124%), Finland (119%), Ireland (116%), France (115%), Sweden (114%), Malta (113%) and Belgium (112%).

**Alcohol &amp; tobacco most expensive in Ireland**

Price levels for alcoholic beverages &amp; tobacco showed significant variations between the EU Member States. The lowest price level in 2019 was registered in Bulgaria (62% of the average), ahead of Poland (74%), Hungary and Romania (both 75%). At the opposite end of the scale, the highest prices were observed in Ireland (188%), followed at a distance by Finland (157%), Sweden (131%), France (126%) and Denmark (119%). It should be noted that this large price variation is mainly due to differences in taxation of these products among Member States.

**Restaurants &amp; hotels more than 3 times more expensive in Denmark than in Bulgaria**

Restaurants &amp; hotels is another category where large differences in price levels were observed. Price levels ranged from 60% or less of the EU average in Bulgaria (45%) and Romania (54%) to 156% in Denmark. 

**Smaller disparities for consumer electronics, personal transport equipment and clothes**

Consumer electronics is a group of products where prices differed less among Member States, ranging from 91% of the average in Poland to 111% in France.

Clothing is another group of products showing a smaller price disparity among Member States, with Bulgaria (79% of the average) cheapest and Denmark (132%) most expensive, followed at a distance by Sweden (118%) and Finland (115%).

With the noticeable exception of Denmark (138% of the average) and the Netherlands (121%), price differences among Member States were also limited for personal transport equipment, from 82% in Slovakia to 114% in Ireland.

5264,"&gt; Friedrich Barbarossa who has always been much more popular in Germany than Friederich II. 'stupor mundi'

Can't let that stand like this.

Friedrich II wasn't called ""stupor mundi"" for naught. He was the original Kyffhäuser until the 17th century.

&gt;Since 1257, the belief in the return of Emperor Friedrich II has been documented and, at the same time, the hope of a new Emperor Friedrich. In San Gimignano notarized bets were made that the Staufer was not dead. [145] The distant grave was decisive for the fact that persons who claimed to be the risen Staufer emperor appeared in Germany up to the end of the 13th century (“false Friedrichs”). The first fraudster of this kind occurred in Sicily near Mount Etna in 1261, perhaps because the people believed that the legendary British King Arthur and the Hohenstaufen emperors were in Etna. The imposter was captured and hanged by Manfred. [146]

&gt;The most successful ""false Friedrich"" was Dietrich Holzschuh (Low German Tile Kolup), who appeared in Cologne around 1283/84. For a year he successfully asserted himself as a Friedrich impersonator. He was received with honor in Neuss. He held court and issued documents with forged imperial seals. Large financial contributions enabled him to surround himself with a court. Kolup justified the long absence of the now supposedly returned Friedrich with a pilgrimage that he had undertaken. The rightful Roman-German King Rudolf of Habsburg had to deploy an army to defeat the imposter. He was burned as a heretic at the gates of the city of Wetzlar. [147]

&gt;In the 13th and 14th centuries, a large number of false friars or other false rulers appeared, which is interpreted by research in response to current social crises by famines, crop failures or inflation. [148] No other ruler of the Middle Ages was imitated as often as Frederick II. [149] The expectation of a return of Friedrich and thus the hope for a better, more peaceful time remained alive in Germany until the years of the Peasant War. [150] The last ""false Friedrich"" appeared in Thuringia on Kyffhäuserberg in 1546. [151]

&gt;According to the Düringian world chronicle of Johannes Rothe, around 1420 in Thuringia it was believed that Friedrich was walking through the ruins of the castle on the Kyffhäuser. Since the 16th century, Friedrich ""Barbarossa"" increasingly replaced his grandson Friedrich II as a memento and in the legend of the rapt emperor. For nationalist-minded German humanists, Frederick II was not a suitable representative of Germany because of his concentration on Italy. [152] In the 17th century it was no longer clear which Friedrich was meant in the Kyffhauser saga. [153] After 1800 ""Barbarossa"" finally displaced his ""non-German"" grandson as a form of memory. “Barbarossa” became a German myth through the legend “Friedrich Rothbart auf dem Kyffhäuser” by the brothers Grimm and Friedrich Rückert's poem; Friedrich II, however, took a back seat to history.

No, they are not just one groups, they consist of many different subgroups as well, with very different backgrounds, beliefs, ideologies and worldviews.

Why can it not be 20% of Jewish billionaires working together with 40% non-Jewish billionaires to further a certain cause (which is almost certainly not world domination, but rather something like reducing taxes or promoting left wing/liberal culture in America etc.)? You are still obsessed with their ethnicity. Do you not think *you* can share more with other Europeans with similar worldviews/beliefs than with some Fins?

&gt;Why are you so obsessed with them?

I just butted in some conversation which I saw someone was being a bit hypocritical. I am not obsessed.

&gt;but so do non-Jewish white billionaires

Yes and that was part of the discussion.

I am not necessarily disagreeing with your other statements either...

But know this too, minorities will shape society differntly than the main population. When Fenno-Swedes were basically the elite in Finland they shaped the country the way the wanted it to be. They also saw the main Finnish speaking people as uneducated and sub-humans (look it up, Svecoman movement). Laestadians (conservative religious group in Finland, over 2% of the population) are also highly overpresented in Finland in politics especially, seen mostly in municipal politics but also in national politics. This is a known fact that some of them are extremely nepotic and dislike the main populance and some don't even let their kids play with them. Previously the movement even told their people who to vote, although that has gone away albeit tradition of voting certain parties is strong still.

I have no reason to believe why some Jews cannot act like this either. I also don't understand why even implying it is seen as anti-semitic, while the previous facts I just listed are common knownledge in Finland and can be said without any hatred or bigotry.",Finland,/r/europe/comments/hd29b4/germany_riots_and_looting_grip_stuttgart/fvlcxtt/,cykaface,1592788579

That is a mostly baseless accusation then. It certainly does not have any more merit than accusing WASPs (white anglo-saxon protestants, usually used in a Northeastern US context) of nepotism.

&gt;Also some are hiding behind their minority status so they aren't ""evil white men"" with money and power

This only shows how unfamiliar you are with American society. Like I said, Jews, are most of the time, simply considered white Americans. Only when it comes to hate crimes/anti-Semitism they are considered a separate group, which makes sense as most hate crimes in the US are committed against Jews.

5319,"&gt;But know this too, minorities will shape society differntly than the main population. When Fenno-Swedes were basically the elite in Finland they shaped the country the way the wanted it to be.

&gt;This is a known fact that some of them are extremely nepotic and dislike the main populance and some don't even let their kids play with them.

Now it makes more sense, but you should be very careful about projecting this knowledge onto the rest of the world.

&gt;I also don't understand why even implying it is seen as anti-semitic, while the previous facts I just listed are common knownledge in Finland and can be said without any hatred or bigotry.

Like I said earlier, it is because the people who say such things most of the time *are* anti-Semites or even fullblown neonazis. You also have to understand that the history of Fenno-Swedes and Laestadians on one hand and Jews on the other hand are likely very different. Fenno-Swedes probably have not been persecuted (including brutally murdered and chased around Europe) for centuries. And any dislike of them is not rooted in the beginnings of the Christian religion (Jewish authorities killing Jesus Christ thousands of years ago). As far as I know, Hitler did not kill Fenno-Swedes either, they were not part of the largest genocide in recent history. There are no conspiracy theories that are believed all around the world about Fenno-Swedes trying to control the entire world, at worst only Finland.

And even when there are no world domination conspiracy theories about a certain group of people that is over-represented in powerful segments of society, hatred can still lead to massacres and persecution. Just read about the ethnic groups that the British used for administration in their colonies and that still (collectively) held a large amount of power after decolonization. Many ethnic Chinese were murdered in Malaysia after independence and ethnic Malays did not want them in their new country, which is why Singapore (majority ethnic Chinese with ethnic Indian and Malay minorities) became a separate country.

Especially now, during times of worldwide crisis, economic collapse and higher tensions between different groups (and anti-Semitism that was already rising even before COVID-19) it is important to remember these things.",USA (from NL),/r/europe/comments/hd29b4/germany_riots_and_looting_grip_stuttgart/fvleorw/,moon89286,1592789694

Operation  Barbarossa, Hitler's  invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, led  to one  of the most brutal  campaigns of World War II: of the estimated  70  million people who died  in World War II, over 30 million died on the   Eastern Front. Although  it has previously been argued that the campaign   was a pre-emptive  strike, in fact, 

&amp;#x200B;

**Hitler had been planning a war of   intervention  against the USSR ever since he came to power in 1933**.  Using   previously  unseen sources, acclaimed military historian Rolf-Dieter   Muller shows  that Hitler and the Wehrmacht had begun to negotiate with   Poland and  had even considered an alliance with Japan soon after taking   power.  Despite the signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, at the   declaration  of war in September 1939, military engagement with the Red   Army was  still a very real and imminent possibility. In this book,   Muller takes  us behind the scenes of the Wehrmacht High Command,   providing a  fascinating insight into an unknown story of World War II.

While that's true I don't believe that it can be blamed on Napoleon but rather the Revolutionary led Legislative Assembly that chose to start that war, Napoleon had not yet become the leader of France at the time. The war of the Second Coalition was a defensive war and the Treaty of Amiens established after its conclusion was broken by Britain and not France. Every subsequent Coalition War was defensive for France. The only conflicts that were started by France at the time were the Peninsular war and the Russian campaign, which were both an attempt to weaken Britain(the aggressor in previous wars), by attacking their allies and trading partners.

5372,"Simply put, the elections were not fair.

There are two main issues:

1. gov uses funds or other illegal ways of bribing people into voting 

2. the space in media is non-existent for opposition parties (here an important thing to note is that still the vast majority of the people get their information from TV or printed newspapers)

The first issue is problematic, but hard to solve since it was so (although to a much smaller extent) forever in Serbian politics. It simply refers to two facts: that public jobs are given based on party loyalty, and that some marginalized/poor people (including Roma) are bribed on election day (sometimes for as low as 15e!).

The second problem causes more issue than the first in terms of votes/popularity (my opinion), and is easier to solve (again, my opinion). It refers to the fact that all printed newspapers are controlled by gov (indirectly). Here is an [example](https://i.redd.it/bu8p8j03vfoy.jpg) of ad's on printed newspapers before the presidential elections (AV is Aleksandar Vucic, the president of SNS party). Second part of this problem is that all TV stations with national frequency (a.k.a. national non-cable broadcasters) are also controlled by gov party. The gov party uses those media to launch smear campaigns at opposition leaders (slander), while glorifying the achievements of the glorious president. Opposition leader are called drug-addicts, traitors, fascists, tycoons, spies, etc etc.. and usually a couple of those things combines.

This all means that opposition has the opportunity to show themselves in different light only on some cable TV's and on internet. And those platforms, while enough to gather some votes, are definitely enough for opposition to have a fighting chance and even a 1% probability of actually wining the election.",,/r/europe/comments/hdd2mg/serbia_parliamentary_election_cesidipsos_exit_poll/fvkzuas/,emr0ne,1592780515

5394,"Well, yeah, get that urban planners agree that it is more efficient to store people in densely populated cities, where people use public system, walk, and bike places.   That is all fine and good, but that is NOT what I want.  That's not what my family wants. 

Here is what I want: I want a 400 square meter house, 4 bedrooms, 4 baths, a living room, kitchen, dining room, family room, a library with built in mahogany shelving and a 2 square meter old-growth mahogany desk, 3 fireplaces, a sun room, a basement with pool table and a pingpong table, a full-sized workshop, a 2 car garage, a backyard with two dozen trees where my kids and I put up a large treehouse, a heated 100 cubic meter 7mx14m pool with a diving board, a slide for my kids and a dozen lounge chairs for me and my friends, a garden to grow vegetables, a fire pit, and a shed for my power equipment.  All of this in a suburbia,  backing into rural area where I can run with my Labrador three times per week.  That's what I want.   

And that is actually what I have (well, except for the outdoor kitchen -- I just have a BBQ).  

I don't want to be biking anywhere or walking anywhere or waiting for a bus; that's just nonsense. If I want to go someplace, day or night, I just jump in my car and go.  And just exactly how would that work when I want to go shopping?  When I shop, I may get 100 kg of groceries, or a trampoline, or several hundred kg of cement -- just how would that work if I am on my bike or walking or on public transport?  Or if I go to a range that is 30 km away, just exactly how do you want me to handle my long firearms?  Or if I want to go to hike or bike in the mountains or the beach or some other far away place, how would I get there without a car?

Don't get me wrong.  I love hiking, I love biking, and I love taking public transport when I travel on vacations.  But for everyday life, I'll stick to driving my car where I want to go.  

So that is what I prefer and that is how I live.  But if you want to live in a 70 sq meter apartment where you share walls with screaming neighbors or crying babies, well, go for it.

5457,"&gt;Wasn't there a law created that barred foreigners from buying land in Serbia?

As a foreign citizen, you couldn't buy agricultural land at all in Serbia, but we signed an agreement with the EU to allow their citizens to own land. There was a lot of opposition to that, so in the last minute before that agreement was supposed to take effect, they placed some additional restrictions. 

The net effect was still loosening of the criteria for land ownership. 

&gt;Specifically targeting some ethnicities?

Not as far as I'm aware. 

&gt;To every Serb I am talked to, they have been very anti refugee or immigrant. Especially also against minorities. 

On the internet? 

I think this is an entirely imported issue. You have a lot of young people consuming Western media and participating in discussions on English speaking internet, coming into contact with right wingers from that part of the world, and they kinda start thinking about the issues Western Europe and the US faces like they're their own. 

I've met a young guy who went on a rant about blacks and Mexicans and whatnot, and I was like: motherfucker, when was the last time you saw a black person? It's basically people living in some internet bubble. 

For the vast majority of people, this issue doesn't factor in at all. Obviously, those who live close to migrant camps or areas that migrants frequent aren't super thrilled about them being there, but most people don't really think about this. 

&gt;I'm not sure how much Vucics SPS reflects on these views though.

Not much, if at all. After all, they allowed the migrants to come here. The government policy on the issue was hands off, they were basically left to their own devices and allowed free movement with some assistance from the authorities.",,/r/europe/comments/hdf5x6/serbia_presidents_party_scores_landslide_in/fvl2eb0/,SadPolicy8,1592782051

5522,"On mobile so I don't have any links right now, but in general the scientific literature says that criminal activity correlates with low IQ, that IQ is an imperfect but certainly not useless metric, that IQ is heritable from one's parents, and that different populations have different average IQs. None of this is disputed among qualified researchers (there might be some person here or there who disagrees, but I mean in general). The origin of IQ differences is still hotly debated and split roughly 50/50, but the consensus is starting to be that it's neither wholly environmental nor wholly genetic. In other words, we can improve the situation to some extent by fighting poverty and discrimination, as well as integrating newcomers, but while doing so might help with this or that individual, it won't completely close the gap on the group level due to inherent biology. It might not be a conclusion to celebrate, but it's seemingly the reality. Of course, the biggest opposition to this is that there's no so-called ""intelligence gene"" isolated yet, but some big dogs in genetics have hinted that it may be coming one of these days, and most see it as a logical outcome. After all, we know that other human traits are genetic despite not having determined which genes contribute to them. While obviously less controversial, no one says ignores that you have your mom's eyes or whatever simply because we don't know yet which genes gave you them.

As for culture, well, I see it as interrelated with genetics. From a Darwinian perspective, culture *is* the environment. Yes, people make and shape the culture, but those born into a culture typically have a better chance of survival and reproduction if they have the right genetics. I suppose that it's cyclical. For example, being born with good genes to be physically strong would have been beneficial in the society of the Spartans, which in turn reinforced the toughness culture, which reinforced the physically strong thriving, etc. I'm not an expert on Greek history, so maybe the super strong Spartans is exaggerated a bit, but I'm sure you get my point. Anyway, nobody would dispute this on a fundamental level. So similarly, while there's not quite a precise term for it, I would argue that certain styles or patterns of cognition would be beneficial for one born in different societies as well. In other words, I'm saying that evolution has shaped the brain as much as any other part of the body. Thinking otherwise is just absurd, I mean why would humans evolve differently for semi-trivial things like looks and significant things like resistance to disease, while the brain stays absolutely identical among every population forever? So, then, the natural world and the culture both contribute to environment in which the body and brain have to function. Thus, when you put people from different populations together, on a group level they will necessarily see some things differently, the newcomers won't always be finely tuned to thrive in the new society (probably more so for more distant peoples), and these differences can't be entirely attributed to culture, poverty and so on.

I'll try to explain why dismantling symbols of tyranny is apparently braindead extremism while blindly sucking off anything remotely resembling ""art"" is apparently high-brow intellectualism.

For the peoples of East Europe, these images are basically what the Nazi Germany would also have left all over the place if they managed to hold on to power for 70+ years, _The Man in the High Castle_ style. Symbols are powerful, and influence generations even after the actual power entity behind them fades. They also influence the language of the art and take up the available cultural space, stifling the growth of new things. Yes, this concerns even unquestionably great works of art. Victorian English or Classical Russian cultural narratives are undoubtedly great. They also displaced and stifled the cultural growth of their colonies by taking up the available space and making it intellectually inappropriate to participate in the silly village narratives of the colonials or write in the underdeveloped, ""rural"" languages of the oppressed.

5687,"The emergence of liberal democracies were at first associated with ideals of liberty and equality and their proponents declared themselves the defenders of the oppressed against the tyranny of majority, yet the modern (also called ""progressive"") liberalism has become the tyranny of identity politics which threatens societies and cultures by inciting hatred, street violence and movements by provoking minorities and other identity groups through hate politics (and ironically accusing their victims of doing so) and giving close air support through their propaganda arm in liberal-owned media. These groups call any opposition ""far right"", ""extremist"", ""bigot"" and try to limit/ban speech with their PC politics while they try to impose their views themselves using or demanding the same speech rights. 
  
These self-declared ""liberal regimes"" operate in other countries (preys) through NGOs (generally funded by non-state individuals who are highly connected with the state or deep-state) who are involved in ""educational programs"" with the purpose of recruiting individuals who can be persuaded by their propaganda and tactics and provoking them into making demands for social change which turn into street events and violence that cause instability in those countries and force those regimes to either submit to external pressure from the predator (liberal) regimes or else, face the possibility of being overthrown either through violent street revolutions (like arab springs, the street violence in Ukraine and Istanbul Gezi Park riots) or by a coup (as it happened in Ukraine and as they tried and failed in Turkey [they had succeeded in 1960 and 1980 - in [confessions of a spy](https://www.amazon.com/Confessions-Spy-Real-Story-Aldrich-ebook/dp/B007SH5A1M) Ames Aldrich describes how he recruited university students in Istanbul by giving them dollars and giving them a hope to get green cards İN THE 70s when there was street anarchy and civil unrest in Turkey before a NATO-led military coup in 1980]).   
  
So, these NGOs are now banned in countries like Russia (a lot of them were mysteriously linked to Soros affiliated organizations which ""liberal"" media conveniently calls ""conspiracy theories"") and more and more countries are taking steps to limit or shut down activities of these NGOs which operate as fronts for foreign intels and terrorism.   
   
Young liberal people in Western countries are brainwashed by the same establishment which now controls the education system, certain mass media (who brands every opposite media or view a conspiracy theorist, propaganda machine or fake news) and other ""opinion leaders"" so their views are taken with a grain of salt.  
  
This guy is right to deny these NGOs operate in his country, those NGOs serve no benefits to their state but only to the benefits of foreign ""liberal"" establishments.

5715,"&gt;The survey should be taken in context. It also found that 93% felt strongly or fairly strongly attached to Britain as their home country;  only 1% favour a ""fully separate Islamic area in Britain, subject to Sharia Law and government""; and 78% support government regulation to prevent extremists from being able to teach in madrassas (Muslim religious schools). 

&gt;Some of the results are open to interpretation. There is a wide variety of opinion on what Sharia law actually involves. Few Muslims believe in limb amputations as a punishment for theft, but many would like the option to have their divorces or non-interest loans governed by religious tenets, the survey shows.  

Kind of relevant, you don't know which aspects of sharia law they're asking for. Same with the hijab thing, they might want their kids to wear it which is silly but hardly fundamentalist, I had friends (and relatives) whose parent's constantly attempted to control their clothing choices because they were catholic going so far as to contact the school, same thing. We push back against THAT not against catholicism in general

Speaking of which I don't doubt for a second that if you ran the same type of survey on church going christians in my country (and others) that you'd get equivalent results, I hate it but I'm not begging to send them ""back where they came from"" or trying to keep any more religious people from coming in.

5718,"Well, nobody's going to get mad for you asking :). There is pretty much no independance movement in Vojvodina. There is a minor party that is for independance but they got around 0,4% of the votes in the previous elections. I'd say it's just because of the demographics. Nearly 2/3 of the population of Vojvodina are Serbs and that percentage has been rising since the end of WW1. Serbs have a great relationship with all the minorities such as Hungarians, Slovaks and Romanians unlike in Kosovo where the relationship with Albanians was sadly one of pure mutual hatred.

Kosovo is the exact opposite of Vojvodina. A historically very poor region with an absolute Albanian majorty od around 80% in the 90s. Since the war in 1999 they are de facto indepentent. Now in the last few years there are huge talks about dividing Kosovo where the majority Serbian parts od it would go to Serbia but where we would need to recognise them as indepentent, but if you ask me I think there will be nothing of that because both the majority of Serbs and Albanians don't want that.

This was in 2018 so the numbers would have inevitably increased by at least one percentile, but likely in the 8% range now. 

So, both the obviously biased stormfront, which was one of the few websites covering this, and wikipedia, which uses statistics from the government, are saying the same thing. I'd like to see the EU statistics if you have them, although I doubt they're as good as the data collected by the Belgian government.

In addition, I actually didn't say anything about Islam. The most common religion in the UK outside of the likely agnostic/irreligious/catholic/Anglican affiliated population is probably Hinduism, if anything, so why would I mention islam? In addition, I don't particularly care what your religion is, because I care for the native British population.

Irish Garda (police) Detective Colm Horkain was shot and killed in the line of duty. 
The suspected killer was arrested by two uniformed, unarmed gardaí who arrived seconds after the attack. The suspect made no effort to flee and is said to have done press-ups after the killing. A number of sources said the man had mental health issues and was regarded as a heavy drinker and cannabis user. 
It is very rare to hear of a garda being killed in the line of duty, only 89 have died since the founding of the Gardi in 1922.

Debates the EU help package, the pm barely got a mandate from the parliament. Since Venstre (liberals) did not support the mandate before she would point out where in the state budget more money to the Eu should come from. 
(Thus breaking a 30 year silent agreement on EU politics between the 2 opposing parties)
The Konservative party then saved her bacon in the last minute by supporting her mandate, against a demand that the European union can never directly tax EU citizens in the future.
And her Mandate is to fight for as much as the package as loans not grants.

Also the population is split on the matter if our former integration minister might have broken the law in 2015 refugee crisis, by breaking up married couples where the one part was a minor.
The debacle comes in the sence that it should be based on individual assessment in each case, and apparently she just ordered alle those people separated because she didn’t like children being married to older guys. 

The split is that half the danes support her,
Cause Child marriage is wrong.
The other half goes “yes it is wrong, but she still cant break the law”

Also the goverment splashed alot of money making alot of public transport Free and alot of museums and ferries cheaper to use during the summer.
All danes can now apply for a “travel pass” making travel in denmark nearly free for the 8 days the pass counts for.

Government is trying to get us to holiday at home this year, and spend money in Denmark.

A few years ago, a city in Southern Germany set up a hotline for male victims of domestic abuse. After one and a half years, they shut it down because almost nobody called in. Which was stunning given that in the same period, there were numerous such incidents. 

Further inquiry into the matter revealed that the main reason why men didn't report in was that those who did file official reports immediately hit rock-bottom because they on top of the abuse itself, they had to suffer through social abuse as well, ranging from not being taken seriously at all to questions like ""*Domestic abuse? Who gave you the harder fight, your wirfe or your daughter?*"", and in one case, the victim was subjected to a criminal investigation because the coppers thought he were covering up an abuse *he* committed.
