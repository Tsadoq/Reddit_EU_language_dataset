21,"&gt;it seems a lot of people simply don¬¥t want it and don¬¥t trust it

Yes.
It's the lack of education and trust in science because we are used to believe whatever the church preaches. That and I don't know how and why but it's also the lack of care about the other. There's no such thing as doing it for the society and wellbeing of everyone in here. 

Orthodox church (which is worse than Catholic) and communism seems to be the only things that made a difference for us. Even though Greece is also orthodox, they seem to perform better in statistics so that's where the comunist past gets in.

Eh, there's one rather prominent European moral authority who may well have been down for a little pederasty:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socrates

&gt;Socrates (/Ààs…íkr…ôtiÀêz/;[1] Ancient Greek: Œ£œâŒ∫œÅŒ¨œÑŒ∑œÇ S≈çkr√°tƒìs [s…îÀêkr√°t…õÀês]; c.‚Äâ470 ‚Äì 399¬†BC) was a Greek philosopher from Athens who is credited as a founder of Western philosophy and the first moral philosopher of the Western ethical tradition of thought.

-

&gt;There exist textual passages suggesting that Socrates had a love affair with Alcibiades and other young males while other texts suggest that Socrates' friendship with young boys sought to improve them and were not sexual. In *Gorgias*, Socrates claims he was a dual lover of Alcibiades and philosophy, and his flirtatiousness is evident in *Protagoras*, *Meno* (76a‚Äìc) and *Phaedrus* (227c‚Äìd). However, the exact nature of the relation is not clear since Socrates was known for his self-restraint, while Alcibiades admits in the *Symposium* that he had tried to seduce Socrates but failed.[149]",üá∫üá∏ üçî United States of America üçî üá∫üá∏,/r/europe/comments/ora3sm/budapest_pride_2021_stop_lgbtq_pedophilia_say/h6juk7l/,duisThias,1627272951

&gt;2. Not all Hadiths are true AND morality is subjective

I will not entertain the notion that the act of raping 9 year old girls or murder can in any way be seen as subjective. This assertion is ridiculous and I think you know it and you are just making this statement to ""defend"" Islam, but in reality you just defend medieval books. Raping 9 year old girls has nothing to do with service to god ( Islam ). Raping 9 year olds is not an act of service to God, it has no place in a religion that claims to be service to God and it has no place in the actions of a prophet that claims to serve God. Either Mohammed as a prophet is false or this book is simply a collection of medieval fantasy stories and myths. There is no other option.

&gt;How am I being a hypocrite, Islam has laws, she violated them full knowing that many people believe in them. What law have I violated that stipulates death for me?

1. She is in the UK - a secular country with its own laws, Islamic laws are irrelevant.

But about the minority. There indeed are (following the 2011 census) about 100.000 Muslims in the Greek Thrace region. It is speculated half of them are Turks and tye other half pomaks and Romani people. These estimates are very roughly based though because Turkish isn't a listed ethnicity in the census. 

This is an example of discrimination for me at least. As the Greek government once also stated is that there is a religious minority and not a Turkish. Actively denying Turks even live there. Besides that I have also been to western Thrace. From what the locals told it is discouraged to speak Turkish in public. (didn't know why though but he was talking about government or something and getting arrested, I think this is a little exaggerated.) But from administration you could see though that Turkish villages get less from governments. Things like asphalt or good drainage not being available, while being available in Greek villages. Also the word ""Turkey"" was forbidden on building names. You can see the places the old signs once covered in the villages. 

Other factors though for me are the local mufti's that are being appointed by the Greek government instead of the people in the villages. And the burning of mosques. Where I live mosques are also being burnt by far right islamophobes. So I don't think nature is targeting mosques. 

But tye absolute worst though is the vandalisation of Turkish graves. Because if the Ottoman Empire there are still many Turkish graves in Thrace. One cemetery got destroyed to an unbelievable point. Gravestones shattered, grass and ground disoriented like someone dug there &amp; the signs used by the golden dawn association. 


Also want to add I met one Turk that has gone to the point of changing his Turkish name to a Greek one because he couldn't find a job.

549,"&gt;And frankly I don't understand why do you have such huge problem with it.

I know you don't, you have found something that always works. Maybe you are not consciously trying to win but you are for sure using tactics that make SURE we never reach a conclusion, there are 100 different debates going on. Specially when your answers are at times ""That isn't always option."" and nothing else. HOW it is not an option? The only way for me to reply to that was to speculate, heavily, which you can then shoot down with ""that is not what i meant"". That is not FAIR, which is why i stopped the actual debate. It was going nowhere, your approach leaves no meaningful way to continue the main discussion. I write something long, try to put some effort in it, try to keep it organized and then you dissect every sentence of it, without really offering me any of the same, deep, organized thoughts. That is not fair, at all. And i can't do the same since you offer SO little in each quote reply.

I did ask you a question: how am i suppose to answer to such a reply? Quote all of your answers, one by one, creating exponentially expansive and chaotic debate. Have you ever thought about how it is on the other side, in what position you are putting me? How can ANYONE answer you comprehensively? Take the KEY points, just a few, focus on those and stop reading SENTENCES. Read paragraphs instead. At least i try to use them thematically..

Now, if i can guess, you have already quoted me 4 times and now arrive here.. Because i believe you don't read any comment to the end before you start replying to them.

And note: i do the same, at times. I am not innocent when it comes to dissection. But, i did notice at some point that when the conversation goes there, it never, ever ends. It is not really useful, not to me, not to you and certainly not for anyone lurking.",Finland,/r/europe/comments/or6rje/right_to_use_a_weapon_in_selfdefence_to_be/h6ioilo/,SquidCap0,1627250008

I am happy you see the first invasion as in favour of Greeks in general. I get why you disagree with the second invasion. I don't support the invasion, but Turkey should externally intervene in Cyprus because of the Turkish Cypriots (because honestly, everyone knows Turks would get discriminated, Turkey only has normal relations with Azerbaijan and Georgia and because of Turkish labour workers Turks also receive much hate in western Europe. So what would you think if it were Turks ruled by Greeks.)

807,"&gt; I don't know

OK then look it up. 

It's a bit of a no brainer than when you know that AZ for some reason is less efficient against Delta, then the countries that used mostly Delta will have much bigger problems with Delta compared to the countries that used only little AZ.

And yes I am comparing the different efficiency regarding Delta as being on the level as who Donald Trump is as the subject has been ENDLESSLY reported on. If you're not aware of that, it means you didn't follow anything about covid for like 5 months. 

&gt;first you talk about sweden being more vaccinated than certain countries, and the moment I say it's less vaccinated than others that are fairing worse by certain metrics you then move the conversation to the types of vaccines and imply anyone who doesn't know that some work better than others is some kind of idiot.

No.

Comparing Sweden to France, it's obviously the vaccination rates.

Comparing Sweden to UK, I don't know for sure but honestly it's logical that UK has a harder time with Delta as they used so much AZ. They vaccinated a lot of people, but the use of it is more limited as they got unlucky and Delta showed up.

Anyway, it can be many different reasons. I just remembered that last summer Sweden also had very low covid level, and a whole army of disinformers were claiming SWEDEN FOR SURE IS HERD IMMUNE :) And then the ""herd immune"" country got smashed by covid during the winter.

And here we are again the summer after with you claiming the thing from last summer lol.

I think a lot of what is heard or talked about is skilled labour. Someone who aim for a carreer and is educated for it is someone that travels more and gets talked about more.

I can totally see office workers in Japan working very long hours while their bus drivers or cashiers work less than in many other countries? And if the skilled/highly skilled workers are talk about majorly but are in fact a minority that could create big differences between perceived workload and average.

I could see the opposite being true for Mexico. Where a stereotype of Latin America makes people think an extra siesta and showing up late, which could partly be true for the skilled workers. But unskilled labour probably requires long days and a lot of work to get by. Agriculture both domestically and in the US is probably something that requires a lot of hours per day and employs a big chunk of people.

872,"Translation:

 Serbian President Aleksandar Vuƒçiƒá assessed on Saturday night that in five months this year, for the first time in history, Serbia will surpass Croatia in terms of the absolute amount of gross domestic product (GDP).

 ""If we count from 1941, when they formed the Independent State of Croatia, and through the republics during the former Yugoslavia, we as Serbia have never had a GDP that could be measured in absolute numbers with theirs,"" Vucic said in an interview with pro-government commercial television Pink.

 He estimated that Serbia will have a GDP worth 51 billion euros by the end of 2021, while Croatia's GDP will be ""slightly less"" than 51 billion euros.

 Vuƒçiƒá stated that, at the time when he led the Government of Serbia, the national GDP was 33 billion euros, while Croatia then had 47 billion euros, and that in the meantime, in seven or eight years, the absolute GDP of Serbia increased ""by more than  50 percent "".

 ""This is the success of Serbia and I understand that someone has the right to be angry,"" Vucic said, implying that he is the subject of a campaign in the region's media because Serbia is becoming more successful.

 ""We want good relations with them (Croats) and much better than they are today. I understand that kind of anger and the need to humiliate Serbia at all times, because it is growing in every sense,"" the Serbian head of state said.

 He says Serbia is convincingly the first in the region
 In a multi-hour interview, he announced that in the circumstances of a favorable state budget and GDP growth in the first half of the year by 8.3 percent, the state will try to stimulate spending with additional financial assistance to citizens and retirees.

 Vuƒçiƒá also assessed that Serbia could be among the leading countries in Europe in terms of subsidies for childbirth and increasing the birth rate, and that a proposal is being prepared for the state to pay a one-time payment of 5,000 euros to parents.

 He pointed out that Serbia is a ""successful country"" and that it will be ""among the first in terms of growth rate in Europe"", which will result in an additional increase in salaries and pensions and a surprise for pensioners over the next year.

 Contrary to good economic and economic indicators, Vucic is convinced that Serbia will be exposed to ""even greater pressure"" because of Kosovo and Republika Srpska.

 ""The great powers never wanted Serbia to be in the region, and Serbia is now convincingly the first and the difference will increase,"" said Vucic, assessing that ""everyone wants to curb Serbia.""",Dalmatia,/r/europe/comments/ore250/vuƒçiƒá_serbian_president_this_year_2021_we_will/h6hglwb/,ManusTheVantablack,1627228641

895,"The ""lockdown"" debate is nonsense.

All countries have a different set of rules. Depending on what you call a lockdown or not, my own country can be set to have never had one or to have had it a lot lol.

The basic fact is just:

The less people meet, the less it spreads. Because people get infected when they like meet other people.

If people meet, outdoors is better than indoors, having some distance between people is better than having people crowded closely together, masks are better than no masks, people talking not so loud is better than singing and so on.

It depends entirely on the country how people behave for which of these things are a problem. If the culture is like, you want to crowd together and talk loudly. you will have a bigger challenge and need more restrictions, than if the culture is to meet not so much and to talk less and lower.

Us Scandinavians have a lot of help just because of our culture that is much less social than like Italy, Brazil, Argentina.

It also matter a lot of people actually follow rules. 

Swedes do - if the governent ask them politely to not invite more than 5 people at home, many will do it. If you ask the French to do that, they will invite even more people just to spite the politicians lol.

So this means that a country like France will need harder restrictions than Denmark or Sweden, simply because fewer people comply.",Denmark,/r/europe/comments/orcr1d/daily_covid_deaths_in_sweden_hit_zero_as_other/h6hgy5w/,Orange-of-Cthulhu,1627228806

The UK is far from the only country enforcing the fact that, no, the Chinese cannot infact build new islands in the ocean, claim they're Chinese territory and that the waters around them are also therefore Chinese.

To frame this as the UK merely doing some chest beating is disingenuous in the extreme and strikes me as just more of the low level anglophobia typical in this sub - if the Chinese are allowed to make their territorial claims without contest, in a few short years we'll be rolling over when they make the next, and the next, until they're claiming other sovereign nations are in fact part of China too.

962,"&gt; The fact ireland had eventually gained independence through violence puts the shits up the British especially in India so rather than face violence from their colonies they started the commonwealth instead as a reason to still have a say in those countries through the soft power rather that the hard power they used to use.

This is a very warped view of the formation of the Commonwealth. Self-government for colonies (which eventually lead to the Commonwealth) was an evolving British policy well before the war of independence. 

Canada had been self-governing in almost all aspects since 1867. The Australian territories gained self government between 1855 and 1890, and Australia as a whole had been self-governing since 1901. New Zealand and Newfoundland were recognised as self-governing Dominions in 1907, and then South Africa in 1910. Irish home rule was already passed into law in 1914 when it was delayed due to WW1.

During WW1 the British set up the Imperial War Cabinet which de facto treated the Dominions as independent states, and in 1919 (with British approval) the Dominions each signed the treaty of Versailles and became members of the new League of Nations separately from the UK.

India also began to slowly be granted aspects of self-government in 1909 and much more so in 1919. The major part of the Indian nationalist movement rejected the British approach, but it's nonetheless important to note that the British were moving towards eventual self-government in India as a matter of policy by this stage.

All of this in the period *before* the war of independence. You can maybe justifiably argue that the war added some fuel to the fire, but characterising events in Ireland as being the direct and singular *cause* of the formation of the Commonwealth is a drastic misrepresentation of events.",Ireland,/r/europe/comments/or6fqa/uk_liberal_campaign_poster_from_1924/h6h2kaj/,Splash_Attack,1627221270

But with them sabotaging nuclear subsidies, trying to make gas green, not trying to get gas also from other place then Russia, Schroder and others being at Gazprom and Merkel/Macron wanting closer cooperation with them... it's all very concerning and reeks of corruption.

1122,"All stable democracies favor conservatism. Across the world, and over ~100 years time span, conservatism is in power about 2/3 of the time. This is almost by design and a sure sign that a society is quite stable: by-and-large, voters would rather not change things. 

Introducing novel ideas, be they socialism, liberalism, or ecology, places the burden of proof on the political movement that introduces them: first showing there's a problem, next, proposing solutions, and finally, demonstrating that those solutions work. So it's natural that those movements are in the opposition most of the time.

Now, fortunately, society evolves, or external circumstances force a change, and liberal ideas get a say to issue major reforms. Finally, after a few decades, the ideas that were novel become mainstream, what used to be progressive is now conservatism, and we have a bout of [""Sinistrisme""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinistrisme), where an ideology that used to be seen as radical is now conservatism. Macron in France is a typical example: his ideological framework is mostly ""Rocardien"", a leftist-socialist movement of the 70's and 80's, but he is perceived as center right, or even  ""the new right"", now that the traditional right has been swiped by the latest elections.",,/r/europe/comments/or6fqa/uk_liberal_campaign_poster_from_1924/h6gjnxt/,thbb,1627206664

The parliamentary system and common law are more or less one and the same and both emerged through a naturally occurring process of compromise between varying stakeholders throughout British history. 

A jurisdiction that has adopted common law, a system of law that arose as a direct act of compromise between Norman law and local customs, would only naturally adopt the same mechanism for societal change on a political level. The parliamentary system was created to facilitate the contradiction of democracy and absolute monarchy. Over time the needle flew from one side to the other and we ended up with what we see in modern 20th century Britain. A complicated system of compromises. 

Compromise does not entail the positive solely but also the negative - obstruction has been a key feature of the system for centuries and will remain so.

1298,"&gt;It is nearly sixty years since the embalmed body of Joseph Stalin was secretly removed from its display case in the mausoleum on Red Square and buried under the Kremlin walls. Yet the Soviet dictator, who was responsible for the deaths of millions of Soviet people, refuses to stay dead and buried.

&gt;In May 2021, 56 percent of Russians polled by the independent Levada Center agreed that Stalin was a ‚Äúgreat leader‚Äù ‚Äî double the figure in 2016, when the Stalinization of mass consciousness had already been a clear trend for several years.

&gt;The trouble is that the pantheon of Soviet gods has been obsolete since before the days of perestroika, but it has not been replaced by any new heroes. There‚Äôs always President Vladimir Putin, of course, but even he has lost half of his appeal as a great historical figure in recent years: back in 2017, 32 percent of Russians polled considered the president the most outstanding figure in Russian history, up there with the poet Alexander Pushkin, and outranked only by Stalin. Now, with 15 percent of the vote, he only just makes the top five, behind Peter the Great and just ahead of Yury Gagarin, the first man in space.

&gt;Attitudes to Stalin in Russia are intrinsically tied to the Soviet Union‚Äôs victory in World War II, over which Stalin presided, and which has become the sacred cornerstone of modern Russian identity. Now the Russian elites are privatizing that victory to shore up the position of the ruling regime. The Russian parliament has passed a new law making it illegal to equate the wartime actions of the Soviets with Nazi Germany. In July 2021, Vladimir Putin signed the document, which also prohibits denying the ‚Äúdecisive role‚Äù of the Soviet people in the victory over fascism.

&gt;To people outside of Russia, it might seem deeply shocking and incomprehensible that Stalin‚Äôs popularity is growing at such a pace. Yet it is an entirely natural consequence of the policy advanced and sponsored by the Russian state of historical amnesia and the literal rewriting of history. Even events that were never the subject of ideological or factual debate are suddenly starting to be contested. And as historical knowledge fails to be passed down among the general public, a new mythology is rapidly taking shape.

&gt;Just a few years ago, the idea of a state-owned news agency questioning well-known facts about the Katyn massacre ‚Äî in which thousands of Polish officers were shot dead by the Soviets ‚Äî would have been impossible: it seemed that the days of blaming the Germans were long over. Yet that is precisely what happened last year. Today, the limits of what is acceptable ‚Äî both ethically and in terms of the treatment of facts ‚Äî are expanding, and red lines are being trampled with impudence and abandon.

&gt;In a different article, the same state-owned news agency described time spent in the notorious Gulag prison camps as a ‚Äúticket to a better life.‚Äù Even in Soviet times, when historical discourse was very limited and being in possession of or distributing Alexander Solzhenitsyn‚Äôs book The Gulag Archipelago could land people in prison, no one in the official media would have dared to make that kind of judgment about the Stalinist meat grinder: there were universal ethical boundaries, invisible though they might have been.

&gt;The results of introducing this simplified version of history into the mass consciousness can best be seen in how Russians perceive the most important event for them in history: World War II.

&gt;The legitimization of the current political regime and the unity of the majority of the nation hang largely on the memory of the war. Putin himself has effectively rehabilitated the secret protocol of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, in which the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany agreed to carve up Eastern Europe between them, so that in the official version, it was nothing less than a ‚Äúdiplomatic triumph for the Soviet Union.‚Äù An episode that was a source of shame for Soviet ideologists and historians, that Soviet leaders including Mikhail Gorbachev denied and attempted to conceal to the last, has now become a matter of pride for the leadership.

&gt;In addition, a widespread idea has taken hold that the Red Army was ‚Äúblindsided‚Äù by the suddenness of the invasion by Nazi Germany, and that the Soviet Union had not prepared for war in order to avoid provoking Germany. In fact, the German attack came as no surprise at all, and the fear of provoking the Nazis was Stalin‚Äôs own paranoia ‚Äî though it did not stop him from preparing for war in his own particular way.

&gt;Indeed, Stalin‚Äôs preparations would prove to be disastrous for the Soviet Union. Back in 2005, 40 percent of a Levada Center poll respondents agreed that the leadership of the Red Army had been decimated by Stalin‚Äôs purges: the mass arrests within the military shortly before war broke out had remained common knowledge since perestroika. In 2021, just 17 percent of respondents agreed with the same statement. Twenty-three percentage points in sixteen years is a staggering degradation in Russians‚Äô knowledge of their history.

&gt;The memory of repression has failed to become the glue of the nation that memory of the war has. For many Russians, it‚Äôs not just a nonessential part of their country‚Äôs history, it‚Äôs an ideologically controversial period. After all, those who work hardest to preserve the memory of the repression ‚Äî the NGO Memorial‚Äîhave been labeled ‚Äúforeign agents‚Äù by the state.

&gt;When asked their opinion about Memorial‚Äôs ‚ÄúLast Address‚Äù project, in which commemorative plaques are put up on the buildings where victims of repression lived, just 17% of Russians polled expressed a negative attitude, but their motivations were symptomatic. The most common reasons given were ‚Äúthey were repressed for a reason,‚Äù along with ‚Äúthe buildings will look like cemeteries,‚Äù ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see the point,‚Äù and ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt need that kind of memory.‚Äù

&gt;As a result, the ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù memory of the war is being pitted against the ‚Äúincorrect,‚Äù supposedly politically motivated memory of the repression, and the increasingly frequent acts of vandalism against the ‚ÄúLast Address‚Äù plaques stand testament to that. In the city of Yekaterinburg in June, unidentified people covered the plaques with stickers depicting symbols of Victory Day, the state-backed, increasingly bombastic public holiday celebrating the wartime victory. This is a literal illustration of the opposition between the two discourses dividing the nation ‚Äî when they should unite it.

&gt;For now, instead, Russians are united by Stalin, whom 56% consider a great leader, and for whom respect is ever growing: from 21% of respondents in 2012 to 45% in 2021, after the controversial raising of the retirement age and the pandemic, which have dented Putin‚Äôs popularity. As disappointment in Putin grows, people return to the familiar figure of the wartime leader.

&gt;Stalin stands in for the lack of modern heroes, and overshadows all the most important historical events of the twentieth century, symbolically compensating for the failures, defeats, and setbacks of more recent years.

1452,"The Battle of Ourique was one of many battles during the Reconquista.

On July 25th 1139, the Christian forces under Afonso Henriques clashed against the Almovarid army led by Ibn Umar (King Ismar in the chronicles).

Outnumbered, the Portuguese forces managed to obtain victory due to the internal division of the Almovarids.

This battle would later be a justification of Portuguese independence, the legend of the ""Miracle of Ourique"", where a ray of light appeared in front of Afonso and showing him the sign of the cross and Christ on a crucifix (if you're thinking ""I heard of that before""... It's basically the same story as Constantine and the Battle of Milvian Bridge). 
This indicated (according to the legend) that Portuguese independence was an act of God.

1455,"In 1698, Emperor Peter I of Russia instituted a beard tax to bring Russian society in line with Western European models. To enforce the ban on beards, the tsar empowered police to forcibly and publicly shave those who refused to pay the tax.

Upon returning from his European travels, Peter the Great launched immediately into the process of ‚ÄúEuropeanizing‚Äù his homeland. The first casualty of the tsar‚Äôs new enthusiasm were the beards of his court nobles, shorn at his welcome-home party. He doubled down at his New Year‚Äôs banquet, at which his razor-wielding jester worked the crowd, giving a box on the ears to anyone who seemed reluctant to shave.  
  
According to Captain John Perry, an English visitor to Russia, the Russians submitted only upon ‚Äúthe Terror of having \[their beards\]‚Ä¶ pull‚Äôd out by the Roots, or sometimes taken so rough off, that some of the Skin went with them.‚Äù

To the pious, the beard tax was a shocking scandal. Rumors circulated that Peter was not the real tsar but a replacement installed by Russia‚Äôs enemies. Anonymous letters accusing the tsar of blasphemy were scattered on the city streets. Nevertheless, the shavings continued.

The beard tax was just one part of a larger project: Peter the Great‚Äôs aesthetic reinvention of Russian culture. The tsar ordered his subjects to replace their familiar long Russian overcoats with French or Hungarian jackets. Mannequins set outside the Moscow city gates illustrated the new fashions for all to see. Tailors who continued to sell Russian styles ran the risk of steep fines, and anyone walking the streets in an old-fashioned robe was liable to have it shorn short by the Tsar‚Äôs inspectors.",Romania,/r/europe/comments/or5h7i/a_beard_token_received_for_paying_peter_the/h6g0anx/,filosoful,1627189865

Yes I am personally attacking you because you responded, matter-of-factly about something you clearly don't know anything about. They way you qualified your statement is how I know. Anyone that has ANY clue about hurricane Harvey knows you don't know what you are talking about. And then you keep doubling down on your ignorance as if somehow, that if you have the last word, you are right.

Since you put all responsibility of proof on me, while you make completely unsubstantiated, moronic claims, then fine, I will qualify my statements since you are too fucking lazy to spend 2 minutes on Google.
(Most likely because you know you are wrong and are just used to having your circle jerk mouth diarrhea substantiated by your equally uninformed friends).

Your first comment was in response to someone stating that the horrific flooding in Germany looks like it was similar to flooding in Texas from Harvey.

Idiot flag 1:

You disagreed and then essentially said that its not similar because Texas did it to itself.
So you disagreed, in a way that doesn't even make sense. Somehow, you think that effects can't look similar from different causes. (The causes ARE the same by the way)


Idiot flag 2:

You imply that it was normal weather that Texas just made bad because ""they'd rather beg for federal money.""

Now if you made an argument that Texas, specifically Houston, should have had better urban planning, and that they allowed development to progress in a way that was unsafe and incredibly irresponsible, then I would have agreed whole heartedly. It definitely made things worse.

But that is not what you said. You wanted to be snarky and arrogant, so you made an idiotic statement that told everyone that you don't Iike Texas and you are willing to look stupid trying to show it.

My comment was that Texas is plenty fucked up, but not being honest about why doesn't help anyone... except people like you who just want to feel like they are superior.

I'm getting increasingly abrasive because you clearly can't take a second to ask yourself if you really know what you are talking about.

Given that even vaccinated people can transmit Covid, particularly the delta variant, I'm having a hard time seeing the benefit of such passes. The Covid pass would only serve to protect those who are unvaccinated from catching a serious version of the disease, which might help the strain on the healthcare system if there are too many old people who are unvaccinated.

1646,"The long history of oppression of Serbs by Croat majority leads to a very hypocritical outlook from Croats when they want to claim Tesla. It's rather obvious that they only want to claim him because he was successful and famous. If he was a normal Croatian Serb, he would have been harassed or outright murdered if he stayed in Croatia (especially considering he lived into the 1940s when the Usta≈°e were put in power).

As form the throwaway Franjo comment, I'm well aware that Tuƒëman was a Partizan. I included the name Franjo as it is a very Croatian name, and there were several clergy with the name Franjo involved with the NDH.

As for Einstein, if Germans start claiming his legacy, many people would be rightfully up in arms about it because Germany chased him away and eradicated or expelled almost all of his people. There's a reason people refer to him as Jewish first and German a distant second. 

As for whether Tesla would have been deemed a ""Croat"", I highly doubt it, because if he stayed in rural Croatia, he never would have succeeded the way he did in the US.

For Ivo Andriƒá, Croats and Bosniaks are welcome to also claim him, but they never do because of his decision to publish his works in ekavski

I don't mind if Croatia claims the achievements of an ethnic Croat, as it is the country that represents Croats, or if it claims the achievements of an ethnic minority born and raised in Croatia who happily claims to be Croatian. Tesla was neither. He left at 18 to Vienna, moved to the US, and never in his life returned to Croatia. The only visit back to the Balkans was to Belgrade later in his life. He ostensibly claimed to be both a Serb and an American, and it stands to reason that both Serbia and the US can claim his legacy, with Croatia having less of a ground to stand on than even Austria.",,/r/europe/comments/oor37i/croatians_picked_their_euro_coins_design_which/h6f7g4z/,Child_of_Peace,1627172320

However, if Armenia decides to leave CSTO, in matter of hours Azerbaijan will invade Syunik by Russias facilitation. Only way for both countries to survive from Russia‚Äôs sphere of influence and join EU society is mutual understanding and trust. Armenia will need to recognise Karabakh as Azeri territory, and of course Azerbaijan will need to give Armenians Hong Kong like autonomy, and assurance that they won‚Äôt be a tool for new possible Russian conflict zone..

&gt;The version of history in the Duan Albanach was long accepted, although it is preceded by the tale of Albanus and Brutus conquering Britain. The presence of Gaelic in Scotland was seen as the result of either a large-scale migration from Ireland, or a takeover by Irish Gaelic elites. However, **this theory is no longer universally accepted**. In his academic paper Were the Scots Irish?, archaeologist Dr Ewan Campbell says that there is **no archaeological or placename evidence of a migration or takeover**. This lack of archaeological evidence was previously noted by Professor Leslie Alcock. Archaeological evidence shows that Argyll was different from Ireland, before and after the supposed migration, but that it also formed part of the Irish Sea province with Ireland, being easily distinguished from the rest of Scotland. Campbell suggests that Argyll and Antrim formed a ""maritime province"", united by the sea and isolated from the rest of Scotland by the mountainous ridge called the Druim Alban. This allowed a shared language to be maintained through the centuries; Argyll remained Gaelic-speaking while the rest of Scotland was either Pictish or Brittonic-speaking. Campbell argues that the medieval accounts were a kind of dynastic propaganda, constructed to bolster a dynasty's claim to the throne and to bolster D√°l Riata claims to territory in Antrim. This view of the medieval accounts is shared by other historians

1757,"&gt;By eleven o‚Äôclock the next day we were well upon our way to the old English capital. Holmes had been buried in the morning papers all the way down, but after we had passed the Hampshire border he threw them down and began to admire the scenery. It was an ideal spring day, a light blue sky, flecked with little fleecy white clouds drifting across from west to east. The sun was shining very brightly, and yet there was an exhilarating nip in the air, which set an edge to a man‚Äôs energy. All over the countryside, away to the rolling hills around Aldershot, the little red and grey roofs of the farm-steadings peeped out from amid the light green of the new foliage.

&gt;‚ÄúAre they not fresh and beautiful?‚Äù I cried with all the enthusiasm of a man fresh from the fogs of Baker Street.

&gt;But Holmes shook his head gravely.

&gt;‚ÄúDo you know, Watson,‚Äù said he, ‚Äúthat it is one of the curses of a mind with a turn like mine that I must look at everything with reference to my own special subject. You look at these scattered houses, and you are impressed by their beauty. I look at them, and the only thought which comes to me is a feeling of their isolation and of the impunity with which crime may be committed there.‚Äù

&gt;‚ÄúGood heavens!‚Äù I cried. ‚ÄúWho would associate crime with these dear old homesteads?‚Äù

&gt;‚ÄúThey always fill me with a certain horror. It is my belief, Watson, founded upon my experience, that the lowest and vilest alleys in London do not present a more dreadful record of sin than does the smiling and beautiful countryside.‚Äù

&gt;‚ÄúYou horrify me!‚Äù

&gt;‚ÄúBut the reason is very obvious. The pressure of public opinion can do in the town what the law cannot accomplish. There is no lane so vile that the scream of a tortured child, or the thud of a drunkard‚Äôs blow, does not beget sympathy and indignation among the neighbours, and then the whole machinery of justice is ever so close that a word of complaint can set it going, and there is but a step between the crime and the dock. But look at these lonely houses, each in its own fields, filled for the most part with poor ignorant folk who know little of the law. Think of the deeds of hellish cruelty, the hidden wickedness which may go on, year in, year out, in such places, and none the wiser.",Denmark (Scotland),/r/europe/comments/oquudd/what_an_atmospheric_photo_wensleydale_yorkshire/h6etkba/,BoredDanishGuy,1627164783

The store basically works as a middleman with some insurance. In the end they will also send the device to Apple for repairs. The main benefit is that they will still be required to replace your device if Apple says the damage is outside warranty. As long as it is within EU warranty.

Also, it's worth mentioning that websites don't usually offer different tiers, so you're usually stuck with a ticket with a carry-on.

I used to work for an European airline and we (me and my colleagues) were more than happy to reschedule flights free of charge or refund passengers (in case it was possible of course, flight cancellation with no option giving or delay superior to 5 hours), since there's really no incentive on our end to not refund a passenger, we don't get bad reviews from superiors and whatnot, but whenever a passenger called with a ticket bought from a third party, we couldn't do jackshit. 

Why? The system simply doesn't allow us to, since we could only refund tickets that our airline had issued (it makes sense, in case I make a mistake I can't cancel the ticket of another company).

The thing is, I think it's more about educating parents (and teachers) about Gender Dysphoria as a medical condition so they can identify it early and do what is best for the child. My issue with the way its being packaged by the LGBT lobby is that its some sort of trendy lifestyle choice with flags and all...its not and in some ways can lead to terrible outcomes for the child.

While I agree that there are some terrible parents out there, we should not use exceptions to define the rules. I would think that the vast majority of parents have some sort of maternal/paternal instinct for their child...they want what is best for the child. 

You use the example of the parents interpreting the child hearing voices as demon possession...could be the case. There was also a case in the UK where a 13 year old girl expressed some confusion about her gender, her parents and doctors immediately started transitioning her and did irreparable damage to her body. When she was of age, she realised she was just a confused teenager and sued the Doctors for allowing her to transition at such a young age...this case led to the law being changed in the UK. The way the LGBT lobby packages the fluidity of Gender can lead to children being confused about their own Gender...they are just kids.

How does the kid know, I knew the first time I met that 5 year old girl that wore boys clothes and hated long hair...she looked like a boy. I called her dude the first time I met her. I could not diagnose her and did not know what Gender Dysphoria was but her parents made a point of researching and understanding why she did not feel comfortable in her own body...he now lifts weights, boxes and started his own business.

Worked in electronic store, customer service, had to listen to this 2 year warranty crap ever day.

There are TWO TYPES of warranty.

Warranty from manufacturer:
This is completely voluntary. A manufacturer is not obliged to give you a warranty for their products.
They can decide the terms and the lenght however they please. They can even give you different warranty periods for different parts on the same device. For instance, smartphones batteries often have a warranty of 6 months, the rest of the device 2 years.
Also, wearing parts are often not covered by warranties. 

Then there is this EU law op talks about:
This basically states, that a device has to be functional for 2 years after the purchase and if there is anything wrong with it, it has to be replaced. BUT this is often times only useful in the first 6 months after purchasing a device, because the burden of proof lies with the vendor. That means the vendor has to proof that the defect was not present at the time of purchase. 
After the first 6 months, the burden of proof shifts to the buyer. They now have to proof, that the device was defective at the time of purchase , which almost never succeeds.",,/r/europe/comments/oqpjpr/amazon_tell_me_i_have_to_purchase_a_new_kindle/h6dzrs3/,MrK0ni,1627149661

1977,"I had a similar experience. Still am, really...

In 2019 I bought a center speaker in the UK. In 2020 I found out that it had a fault, that it had probably always had - I just hadn't noticed / looked into it (I tried multiple amplifiers and cables to identify that the fault indeed was with the speaker).

Anyway, I contacted the store, and after several months of back and forth (mostly because they wanted to contact the manufacturer - not that it should matter) I was instructed to ship it back.

They received it and forwarded it to the manufacturer - who after a month or two replaced the wrong part and sent it back. Of course the issue persisted. The store agreed to send a replacement for the actually broken part and I could swap it out myself. Only, they required that I return the broken part for inspection. 

I got the part, swapped it and everything was great!

I then contacted the store and said that I would happily return the broken part, after they reimbursed me all my shipping expenses. They kindly informed me that since I was on the mainland, they wouldn't cover these expenses, as written in their terms of service.

I replied that of course I hadn't read their terms, but regardless of what they wrote in there (if you don't want to pay for repair related shipping, please don't shop with us) they could not get out of their obligations as per the law.

They replied that if I didn't return the broken part they would invoice me the cost of a replacement. I told them this was absurd, and we didn't get much further.

EU consumer protection enter scene left.

I made a complaint and after a month and a bit of back and forth they agreed to cover the costs of shipping. However, they wouldn't pay the cost of the broken part that I had yet to send until the manufacturer had inspected it and deemed it broken.

So I got the money for shipping the entire speaker.

It's been 6 months since they received the part back and... No money. Every month I get a nice email from the EU entity telling me that they still haven't heard back from the store.

At least I got the bulk of my shipping costs covered, the price of returning the unit being about a third of shipping the entire speaker.",,/r/europe/comments/oqpjpr/amazon_tell_me_i_have_to_purchase_a_new_kindle/h6dzz71/,gjoel,1627149761

2014,"Samsung were an absolute travesty to work with when my ¬£1200 TV bit it after 13 months. Spontaneously shutting off, sporadic and massive colour distortion, and none of the Apps even opened anymore. It was borderline unusable for a ¬£200 TV nevermind ¬£1200. Samsung were ""generous"" for me too and ""repaired it"" for free (which took 6 weeks) only for it to come back in even worse shape. It stopped turning on entirely after about a week.




I called again and they said since it already had a repair I'd have to pay for a service but they'd repair it again. I said absolutely not, for all I can tell your first repair made it worse and I'm covered under the 90 day manufacturer repair warranty. After maybe half an hour of her assuring me my only choice was pay to repair (again) and me saying no this is on you, they eventually agreed to have someone come look at it for free. At this point I just wanted a replacement because 13 months for a ¬£1200 TV is clearly not a good enough lifespan. 





The second time the repairmen brought it back after another 4 weeks and said it can't be fixed, and they'd recommend to Samsung it be replaced. 8 more weeks and almost daily calls from myself for updates in the last 2 weeks of that and they agreed to replace the TV. It took over 4 months to get that clearly non-functional TV replaced, and it would have been much much longer had I not constantly pestered them for any kind of update.

Took a couple of visits by a tech who tried to repair it first, but I eventually got a new one and the person installing it told  me that also had a two year warranty under law (ie the clock reset to the date I got the new one)

- in the past my toddler damaged a no-name kids‚Äô iPad cover by actually pulling a section and tearing it.

Turks ""going into someone's home"" is at least a millenia old. Should we also apologize for conquering your grand grand grand grand grand..... grand fathers' land in fucking 1100 AD? That land is as much as home to you as to us for at least a good 900 years. We are pretty much natives at this point.

Now going back to your ""analogy"". There's a house, in which lives two families, one living there for a thousand years, the other more than a thousand. A family feud happens and one family kicks the other family outside by force. The weather outside is a fkn blizzard and some wild animals are on the loose. Some of the kicked out died by the use of force, some die in cold, some die by the wolves and the survivors goes back to their relatives' home. The police comes and finds the family, who kicked the other out, guilty and major perpetrators are punished with death. Now after 100  years people who survived and went to their relatives' home come back and want the house back, *completely*. The current owners of the house say that the instigators who kicked you out are punished and it's passed 100 years after the event. They say that this is now their home and that they can't give it back to you under no circumstances. They offer you their condolences for your loss but can't do anything more because it would harm *their* livelihood.

A few months later the bridge of the bass collapsed under the string tension for no reason at all, probably because rosewood is not the best material for a bass bridge.

I emailed the retailer and told them what happened and they told me I could ship it to them for a free repair. I replied saying that's ok but I wouldn't pay for the shipment as the EU law said that they needed to cover the shipment costs as the item was still in warranty.

The next mail I received  was a confirmation for a delivery of a brand new acoustic bass to my address, as it was cheaper for them to send a new one than to repair mine and ship it back.

&gt;eems to me they boycotted because they knew they'd lose embarrassingly. 

No, they quite literally said they are boycotting because of unfair election conditions, before any polling or any campaign started.

&gt; Why would the EU say ""yes, stay away from elections""?? 

Because they are well aware of the tactics Vucic uses and how fair the elections are, but oh wait, they don't care because they support him, fully.

&gt;? If democracy is to work then there need to be candidates running for office. Yeah there may be fraud but that's still better than no elections at all.

How about pressuring Vucic to allow more fair and democratic elections? having no elections isn't the only alternative, but it was a better one than the sham elections.","""–°–≤–∏—õ–µ –∑–æ—Ä–∞ –≤–µ—Ä–Ω–æ–º —Å—Ç–∞–¥—É,—Å–ª–æ–≥–∞ –±–∏—õ–µ –ø–æ—Ä–∞–∑ –≤—Ä–∞–≥—É!""",/r/europe/comments/opqic5/arrested_mafia_leader_confesses_he/h6d5zmu/,Helskrim,1627134892

2218,"Government accused of ‚Äòabsurd hypocrisy‚Äô for taking Brussels cash with strings  


The UK government is telling councils to display EU flags across towns and cities in England as a condition for receiving high street Covid recovery cash.  
  
Guidance issued to local authorities by the communities ministry this summer says the blue and yellow symbol of European unity is ""required"" to be displayed around ""every piece of signage, pavement sticker, or temporary public realm adaption"" funded under the scheme.  
  
The requirement, which will see thousands of new EU flags posted on official buildings and in public places across the country, exists because the European Regional Development Fund has given money to the UK to help with the Covid-19 reopening.  
  
Despite Brexit having happened, under the withdrawal agreement the UK is still eligible for certain payments from the fund until the end of 2023 ‚Äì but with strings attached.  
  
The flag rule, imposed from Brussels but enforced from Whitehall, is embarrassing for ministers because they are keen to rid UK public buildings of EU flags, but do not want to turn down the Covid recovery cash.

The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport announced in only March that it was repealing planning rules dating back to 2007 in a bid to make it harder to fly EU flags.  
  
And some Brexiteers have claimed that leaving the EU has made it easier to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic.  
  
Under the Welcome Back Fund, councils have been given ¬£56 million EU cash to ""support the return to high streets safely and to build back better from the pandemic"".

The fund, administered by the government in Westminster, is being spent on adaptions to high streets to ""promote a safe environment for local trade and tourism, particularly in high streets as their economies reopen"".

Examples of aid include street planning, extra seating, green spaces and new signage, flowers, and the removal of graffiti ‚Äì anything that encourages people to return to the high street.  
  
Virtually every local authority in England is getting some of the cash, with the biggest recipient Leave-voting Birmingham, which has landed over ¬£1 million in funding.  
  
Liberal Democrat frontbencher Christine Jardine said: ""This shows the absurd hypocrisy of this Conservative government. They have spent years denouncing EU projects and pulling the UK out of funding schemes like this, and now they have the gall to trumpet a fund made possible by exactly the sort of European cooperation they are turning their backs on.  
  
‚ÄúInstead of worrying about displaying the EU flag, the government should be working hard to support the thousands of struggling high street businesses ‚Äì starting with extending the furlough scheme that‚Äôs due to taper off next week.‚Äù  
  
Naomi Smith, chief executive of campaign group Best for Britain said: ""For a government that measures patriotism by the number of union flags in a BBC report, showing that the EU is helping our highstreets in this particular way will have a bitter taste.""  
  
But she added: ""With parts of the UK like Wales previously receiving ¬£400million every year from the EU but now set to receive a measly ¬£10 million from the government's levelling up fund, this branding is a small reminder of the support that's been lost to the areas of the UK most in need.‚Äù  
  
The government appears so anxious to comply with the rules stipulating that the EU flag is displayed it has told councils that ""copies of all publicity materials, including press releases, marketing activity and posters displayed in venues where activity takes place must be retained to demonstrate proactive activity and the correct use of the EU logo and required text"".

The rules say the flag must be displayed on ""all electronic and print publication materials used for information and communications supported by the fund"" including advertisements, leaflets, project reports, posters, and websites.  
  
It also demands the display of ""at least one poster of minimum A3 size, readily visible to the public (e.g. the entrance area of a public building) at the location of the activities being implemented"" that includes the EU flag and reference to the European Regional Development Fund.

But I will bite. I just can't find it in my good conscience to let the victims of a slaughter just 50 years ago to live under their butchers without any political guarantees (like f.e. the Annan plan proposed or a federalist solution). 

In fact I find it *quite* dishonest of GC to make the TCs believe that they are completely different people now and wouldn't do such a thing again, when the people who turned a blind fucking eye to the atrocities are still alive. They had a chance to be an independent and a multicultural state and they *absolutely* blew it and in my heart of hearts they lost any right to rule over TCs ever again.

I know that GCs like to put the whole blame on ultranationalist groups in Greece, but they gloss over the fact that they have accommodated and embraced these ultranationalist groups letting them police minority areas and even before the coup they have tried to reduce the minority representation in politics even less. They aren't people who should be given another chance to rule over TCs.

In  fact, who would willingly support letting the victims be ruled by their once slaughterers again? Do you think Kosovo could be ruled by Serbia again? Or a more marginal one, do you think Armenians could ever be ruled by us again? My answers to these questions are both ""no"".

This was a core element in the formation of the green party and public pressure forced even the conservative government to step out of nuclear power much faster than planned after Fukushima.

The rejection of nuclear power production because of its large environmental impact, waste and security problem etc. has always been a large driver for implementing regenerative energy sources. And clearly the energy transformation with massive subventions also on the level of the individual household has let to an increase of regenerative energy sources from 3% to 30% of the energy consumption while the gas usage started to go down slowly after a small increase in the early 2000 due to it replacing oil in many uses.
I'm also not a fan of building a gas pipeline in 2021, but because of the way to CO2 neutrality being set by law and each branch of government has to fulfill its goals on a yearly basis, the scenario your depicting can't become true.

I would take anything [The Economist](https://citationsneeded.libsyn.com/episode-98-the-refined-sociopathy-of-the-economist) says with a grain of salt. Highest rate of death by shootings in Europe in the past fifteen years? More than  Ukraine, which had a war? More than ex-Yugoslavian republics, where many of the weapons reputedly come from? More than *Albania?* More than *France,* where [130 people were killed in a single night?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/November_2015_Paris_attacks)

I'd review the methodology, lest this be like the time people called Stockholm the World Capital of Rape when actually it was a case of more people reporting it and of authorities counting each instance of abuse in a prolonged relationship separately instead of as a single count of the crime.

Lots of people have a vested interest in slandering Sweden and their policies, be they on immigration, gender equality, worker power, etc. It happens time and again. I'd take a Malm√∂ suburb over its counterparts in Marseille, Naples, Istanbul, Tbilisi, Grozny, Mitrovica, Talinn, Vilnius...

In fact, if you look at Eurostat, Lithuania is doing *astoundingly poorly* in crime rates, drug addiction, death rates in general, by violet crime, by suicide, by accident...

2519,"Hah!  No true superman stoops to the filthy Asiatic custom of pants!

https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-pants-worn-horse-riders-3000-years-ago

&gt;Two men whose remains were recently excavated from tombs in western China put their pants on one leg at a time, just like the rest of us. But these nomadic herders did so between 3,300 and 3,000 years ago, making their trousers the oldest known examples of this innovative apparel, a new study finds.
&gt;
&gt;With straight-fitting legs and a wide crotch, the ancient wool trousers resemble modern riding pants, says a team led by archaeologists Ulrike Beck and Mayke Wagner of the German Archaeological Institute in Berlin. The discoveries, uncovered in the Yanghai graveyard in China‚Äôs Tarim Basin, support previous work suggesting that nomadic herders in Central Asia invented pants to provide bodily protection and freedom of movement for horseback journeys and mounted warfare, the scientists report May 22 in *Quaternary International*.
&gt;
&gt;‚ÄúThis new paper definitely supports the idea that trousers were invented for horse riding by mobile pastoralists, and that trousers were brought to the Tarim Basin by horse-riding peoples,‚Äù remarks linguist and China authority Victor Mair of the University of Pennsylvania.
&gt;

Increasing tension driven by Islamic fundamentalists. Muslims protesting outside schools because teachers show a picture of Muhammad, for example.

It just so happens that a billion Muslim women around the world are shamed and coerced into covering their bodies.

The 1991 Soviet coup d'√©tat attempt, also known as the August Coup, was a failed attempt made by Communist leaders of the Soviet Union to take control of the country from Mikhail Gorbachev, who was Soviet President and General Secretary of the party. 

The coup leaders were the top military and civilian leaders of the USSR just below Gorbachev. They were hard-line opponents of Gorbachev's reform program, angry at the loss of control over Eastern European states, and fearful of the new union treaty that was about to be signed. 

The treaty decentralized much of the central government's power to the 15 republics. The hard-liners were very poorly organized. They met defeat by a short but effective campaign of civil resistance mainly in Moscow, led by Russian president Boris Yeltsin, who had been both an ally and critic of Gorbachev. 

The coup collapsed in only two days and Gorbachev returned to office, while all the plotters lost office. Yeltsin became the dominant leader and Gorbachev lost much of his influence. 

The failed coup led to both the immediate collapse of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the dissolution of the USSR four months later.",,/r/europe/comments/oqkgok/soviet_rock_fans_attend_a_concert_in_moscow_on/h6c8rj7/,atdoru,1627107772

&gt;
&gt;The latter two announced, this Wednesday morning, their desire to take legal action on this subject. 

I mean, I was surprised that they went to Amnesty International for forensics rather than French counterintelligence.

But I'm even more surprised that the action they'd take would be individual lawsuits.  Like, I cannot but imagine that they were targeted because of their official role.  So I'd expect that the French government would direct any response, and that it would be on behalf of the state.

Not only that, but I'd guess that Morocco probably has a doctrine of [sovereign immunity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_immunity), which I'd think would doom attempts by someone being spied on to sue an intelligence agency.

&gt;*Sovereign immunity*, or *crown immunity*, is a legal doctrine whereby a sovereign or state cannot commit a legal wrong and is immune from civil suit or criminal prosecution, strictly speaking in modern texts in its own courts. A similar, stronger rule as regards foreign courts is named *state immunity*.

2621,"If you are asking what would be South Korean's reaction, I think they would be infuriated.

&amp;#x200B;

1) If you use 'this was a colony of Japan, liberated after WW2'

America loves Japan and doesn't care about Korea!  

&amp;#x200B;

2) If you use some kind of racial stereotype thing 

Maybe a decade ago people wouldn't have cared, but now they think Americans should more sensitive to Asian discrimination if they want to force people to sensitive to black discrimination (same level of sensitiveness, you know).

&amp;#x200B;

3) If they use 'Asian male' kind of racial and sexual stereotype

Radical feminists would love that and especially the young males would hate it. Korea is very sexually divided now, 84% of 20s male and female think they are discriminated in the society.

&amp;#x200B;

4) If they use 'Asian female' kind of racial and sexual stereotype

Radical feminists would love that and especially the young males would hate it.

Are you talking about the [quote](https://deadline.com/2021/07/tokyo-olympics-south-korea-flags-japan-protests-1234795297/) cheering for the athletes that was derived from words written by Admiral Yi Sun-sin, one of the greatest war heroes in Korean history and an individual who was a defender in a war against an invading Japan? Some far right nationalists made a big stink about it, even waving around that attrocious flag of the Japanese Imperial Army in front of the building in protest, and a deal was made (not a straight on ban) where the Korean Olympic Committee would take down the quote and the Japanese Olympic Committee would ensure that flag would not be flown around.

Second of all, they're not telling people that they can't be religious. 

Third of all, this whole thing started with the ban of religious symbols and clothing in primary and secondary schools, back in 2004. Tell me, why should religion be in schools (in other than academic sense that is)? 

It has since evolved to full on ban on headscarves in 2011 in general. Is this fascist? Hardly. Is it odd, to non French yes, it is.

Turkey left the Ottoman Empire? That's interesting news.

&gt; You said Turks in the Balkans were Balkan just because they lived there. 

I don't recall saying just...

&gt; Therefore the Turks in Asia are Asian. Therefore a country that is almost entirely in Asia, and made up mostly of Asian Turks, is Asian.

Eh, it's ""also"" Asian.

&gt; They looked to Russia for aid, as opposed to Austria-Hungary or whoever else

No? Bulgaria went for Germans just after liberation, Croatia didn't opted for Russia either, Bosnia sure did not too. You're referring to Serbia and Bulgaria to some level.

&gt; The Russian Tsar was considered the Defender of Christians in the Ottoman Empire

For some yes, for the rest, no.

&gt; The South Slavs saw Turks as unwelcome foreign overlords, and looked to the Russians as their saviours. Pretty clear who they were closer to. 

Let me give you a secret: that's not something changes whom you're closer culturally while that statement is not true for all cases but as it's irrelevant I'm to skip.

When I used to go to Korea 2x every year during grade school, I remember my Dad suggesting that I go to a Korean public school during summer vacation, because they start later in July. 

I sat in a Korean public HS for a week (I emigrated to the US when I was 9) and that was enough for me. 

Mfers wake up, go to school with 2x bento boxes, take notes during school, go to cram school after school, then eat the 2nd bento box for dinner, then go to another cram school, then some go to self study desks at a study/cram library. After all that's done, I don't even think most HS kids go home till around 9-10pm. Then they go home, eat some momma's cooking, study till like 2am in the morning in their rooms, and finally go to sleep. Rinse and repeat this shit 6/7 days in a week and it's no surprise there's so many kids committing suicide from academic pressure.

This entire debate about Britain /in particular/ returning stuff they ""stole"" is named that because the only reason Brits could get to those sites and allow no one else but them to excavate and get those artifacts and take them to Britain is colonialism.

Artifacts should go back to their home sites. This is my point. This is my /only/ point. Like I said.

3234,"Dumb career politician who tanked the German military and defence industry. She was head of the German MoD and had zero understanding of military matters, and ordered the Germans to abandon the G36 rifle because it had plastic components that melted under sustained fire and accuracy suffered enormously in the Afghan heat (literally airsoft guns were more accurate). There were a few key problems with this:

A) The German MoD was still under contract with the G36 manufacturer H&amp;K. H&amp;K was quite upset because this was a multi-billion Euro contract that the German MoD was breaking without consultancy.

B) There was no replacement small arms rifle available that wasn't horrifically obsolete, not only technically but also strategically and logistically. There are seven different variants of the G36 - each specially designed for specific operational conditions - and over 150,000 in use.

C) The overheating and accuracy issue was caused by a batch of dodgy ammunition--it was not relevant to the weapon system and was actually solved before Shotgun Urschi tried to divorce the G36.

D) The polymer components that failed were easily replaceable without an armourer, indeed spare components were issued in each soldier's field kit. They were failing before they were meant to, but that was fixed quite quickly. Still, it's not what you want to happen in a firefight so this was a big issue at the time.

E) You're not meant to fire the G36 that fast anyway. Every firearms weapon system ever developed has one big obstacle: friction. Friction from mechanical operation and the bullet to the receiver and barrel will eventually ruin the firearm, but this is easily prevented by regular maintenance and repetitive fire. You fire an ""assault"" rifle in bursts of 1-3, you fire a machine gun in bursts of 5-7, you do not hold down the trigger, dumping the entire magazine, reload, again and again, which was exactly the conditions the G36 failed in. For reference to other firearms in the same conditions, the Russian AK-74M catches fire, the British L86A3 will weld a spent cartridge casing into battery (ie it gets stuck in the chamber and permanently ruins the gun), and the American M4 carbine/M16 rifle will incinerate the lubricant and the moving parts will weld together. Comparatively, a replaceable plastic component melting isn't a big problem.

However Ursula didn't care. She didn't care that the G36 failed in unrealistic conditions during tests which explicitly exist to see just how far beyond operational conditions a weapon system can be pushed, she didn't care that it was a batch of dodgy ammunition which caused the accuracy issues, she didn't care that there was absolutely nothing wrong with the G36 other than some fundamental design methodology issues (excessive use of these plastic components to save weight and the weapon simply wasn't suitable to the conditions of Afghan; good thing the Germans spent most of the war with their feet up in Camp Bastion), she went ahead and without asking H&amp;K if they could fix some of these issues she decided that the German military was going to stop using this weapon system immediately.

And now this woman is in charge of the European Commission and she was appointed for the ‚Ç¨300,000 per annum job because the EU Governments couldn't decide between two different candidates. It is important to note that the sole country that abstained from this decision was Germany.",Albion Est Imperare Orbi Universo,/r/europe/comments/opwh9r/germanys_patriotism_paradox_new_polling_shows/h69f75e/,VivaciousPie,1627055699

3308,"&gt;Try me back when you can find a Morocco that is continuum of Umayyad Iberia. Lmao indeed. And no, Moroccons hadn't inhabited Europe for centuries within a continuum unlike Turks - they ruled over and then left.

Iberia had more Moroccans than the Balkans had Turks. And yes for centuries lol.

&gt;Only it was not. Mainland was Balkans for Ottomans and that was where empire was structured and Balkan Muslims and Constantinople were thers. Anatolia was a backwater and a discarded territory that was no different than an internal colony. Let me remind you that, unlike you assume, for Ottomans it was Muslims that mattered, not Turks: and Balkan Muslims were the core, whether Turk or non-Turk.

Constantinople was majority Christian until like 1900. The Balkans were also vastly more Christian than Muslim. 

Also you're contradicting yourself here. On the one hand, Turkey is a continuation of the Ottoman Empire, but on the other hand you're saying the Ottoman Empire wasn't a Turkish empire. 

Fact of the matter is that Anatolia was where pretty much all the Turks actually lived, so the Ottomans controlling the Balkans doesn't make the Turks Balkan.

&gt;Ehm, Indo-European is spoken more in Asia, sorry.

All the Slavic languages are spoken in Europe and the Russian language developed in Europe. Turkish developed in Asia, all the other Turkic languages are in Asia, and the vast majority of its speakers today live in Asia.

&gt;Turks also do share more cultural ties with South Slavs than Russians if you're at it. So not sure what you're onto.

First of all, it might be relevant to note that this was not just ""some court"", but the Bundesverfassungsgericht, which is the highest existing court in Germany.

And second, the exact verdict was not the CO2 saving goals being too low. Instead, the court ruled that emission levels have to be set all the way to zero. Before, CDU/CSU and SPD only defined levels until 2030, so they were extended to 2045.

Except Turks can speak to Turkmens, so not really, also the vast majority of Turkey and Turks aren't in Europe, so again, just no.

&gt;If you're the argue that Ottomans and the Turks and other European Muslims under them were less in contact and relation with the rest of Europe or Ottoman Empire as a Balkan Empire hadn't been in Europe, then you're being ignorant.

I never said that lmao. Nice strawman. The Moroccans also interacted with Europeans a lot. I guess they're European?

&gt;Lol, you claim that Turks were in less contact with the rest of the Europe than Russia and calling me ignorant now? Again, rest of Europe is what you said and what's being said, lol.

I never said that. Once again, beating another strawman you've made rather than addressing any of my points.

&gt;And I have news for you: Turkics and Turks are two different things. Turkomans came from wherever but got into Europe and got Europeanised, both genetically (as you seem to care about these) and culturally. Ottoman Empire was simply a Balkan Empire. 

Turks and Turkmen can literally speak to each other(with trouble) so don't pretend they're nothing alike lmao.

Also a Balkan Empire with the vast majority of its landmass outside of the Balkans???

&gt;It's simply, Turkey since Ottoman times are in Europe and you not liking is tied to you acting like a weirdo. Is it racist? More like it's ignorant.

Turkey is literally the first place ever to be called ""Asia"", but yeah totally a European country because... why, exactly? They come from Central Asia, speak a language from Central Asia, have their cultural brethren in Central Asia, live in Asia, etc.

3476,"&gt; Eastern Roman influences have nothing whatsoever to do with Turks who regard or regarded the Eastern Romans as conquered, foreign peoples and regularly insulted them. It's schizophrenic to call Rums infidels and then attempt to appropriate their culture and influence.

""MuH culTuRaL appropiation""
Christ, American libs have invaded this place too?

I'll tell you a little secret: How you view another group, often has little to do with cultural influence. I know it's hard to get with a black&amp;white worldview, though.

Catholic Spain *detested* Moors. That doesn't stop Spanish people from still using instruments invented by Moors, and eating dishes that are originally Moorish. Nor does it stop Portuguese people from using ship designs that date back to Al-Andalus.

Nazis saw Poles as subhuman vermin who needed to be exterminated. That did not stop thousands of Germans from having surnames of Polish origin, or eating Polish dishes, or naming their villages after Polish places.

It's true that the Ottomans treated Greeks as second-class citizens. That didn't stop the Ottoman palace from enjoying Eastern Roman music, or starting to use Eastern Roman recipes, or so on. Gee, I wonder why Turks eat dolma, I also wonder why the Ottomans inherited the timariot system from Rome.

Cultures influence and get influenced by each other. If they didn't, nobody would have anything in common with each other. It's as schizophrenic as Spanish people eating paella.

That's not schizophrenic. That's how history works. And if you think Turkish culture has ""nothing to do with Eastern Rome"", then can you tell me why Turkish culture shares a lot with Greek and Bulgarian and other Balkan cultures?

Well, you can't. Because it is much easier to simplify history to ""muh ebul barbar-I mean, Turks, killed eberyone reeeeeeeeeeeeee"", amirite?",Turkish Constitutional Monarchist,/r/europe/comments/opui17/european_countries_that_never_recorded_30c_or_less/h68mdww/,ArcherTheBoi,1627041660

There was actually a pretty big case to ban an actual extremist rightwing party we have here that see themselves as spiritual succesors of the nsdap, but they werent banned even though they were working against the constitution because they were too small and dont actually cause any harm. So the idea was basically to not turn them into martyrs so they couldnt use the oppressed by state narrative when they form a new party.

3492,"&gt;After he was forced to resign by Wilhelm II, Germany took on a far more aggressive approach to enlarge it's place in the sun, including by entering in an aggressive naval arms race with Britain

Du don't that's the old British propaganda.
Why should Germany(the second strongest economy in the world not have a big fleet)?
Why should Britain have a monopoly on a big fleet?
We saw what happened when Britain had a better fleet, it was the fanine in WW1, because of the British blockade where over 100 000 innocents died. 
Why is it against peace?

It seems just like Britain didn't want a rival to its empire.

Not because it is incorrect ( even though to make that argument one must use a really flexible definition of sovereignty ), but because I had notice that if you start arguing in a negative form and particularly suggesting without the EU their country would be small and insignificant people became really defensive. Is not a good way to argue because it pushes your listener to do the opposite than listen to you, they immediately get upset and become really defensive, and whatever you say after that, even if it makes sense, it's disregarded.

3610,"It depends on what you mean by sovereignty.

A lot of small, independent countries can make their own rules and even be isolationist. This is the case now and it will be the case going forward. However, just like European (and worldwide) culture has been heavily shaped by the US since the end of WWII, there are cultural, economic and political developments ahead of us, which will shape our world going forward. Small, independent countries will not significantly shape these developments but will simply have to internally adapt to the global environment. If Europe wants to have any say in the future development of global norms and values, it needs to act united. In the end, this may end up letting us keep more of our own national identities than a future in which we have more internal sovereignty but need to adapt to a world entirely shaped by China and the US.",Berlin (Germany),/r/europe/comments/opwh9r/germanys_patriotism_paradox_new_polling_shows/h684i8f/,ViciousNakedMoleRat,1627026690

Why waste massive amount of money in their wages? It brings nothing.

And lastly. Just like you say how many of that stuff can be paid for by Russia or Benelux and who gets more value.

In details : [source](http://lix100.alwaysdata.net/minifusees/spip.php?article15)  
A little history: it all began with Pierre-Georges Lat√©co√®re. He came to Toulouse to create railroad cars, but was eventually commissioned to develop airplanes for the government at the beginning of World War I. In 1927, Lat√©co√®re created l'A√©ropostale. Since war planes were no longer needed, he decided to set up air links to Casablanca and Dakar from Toulouse and even dreamed of flying to South America. This dream was realized by Jean Mermoz, who succeeded in making the first crossing of the South Atlantic by plane. Many pilots succeeded one another at l'A√©ropostale between 1920 and 1933, including the famous Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry, but also Daurat and, as you have understood, Mermoz. Since then, the State has continuously supported the aerospace industry in Toulouse.

wiki [A√©ronautique et espace](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89conomie_de_Toulouse)  

The town has a long history of aviation, as well before the First World War, Cl√©ment Ader (from Muret, south of Toulouse) invented several planes in 1890: the √âole (Avion), the Z√©phyr (Avion II) and the Aquilon (Avion III). With these inventions, he is considered the father of modern aviation. With the First World War, aeronautical activities were relocated to Toulouse, as the city was considered to be far enough from the front lines.

On 31 July 1963, the State took an important and decisive decision for the Toulouse region, in its policy of decentralisation, Toulouse was confirmed in its central role as the capital of aeronautics, by decentralising the National Centre for Space Studies (CNES) to Rangueil (south of the city). Moreover, thanks to the establishment of the CNES, many major engineering schools and laboratories are being set up in Toulouse, such as Sup'A√©ro, CERT, ENAC, ENSICA and LAAS, which provide the CNES with highly qualified researchers. On the Palays site in the south-east of the city, a subsidiary of the Lagard√®re-Matra group, which has now become Airbus Defence and Space, is established. The latter company, linked to the Airbus Group (Airbus' parent company), is a leader in the field of observation satellites and has a strong involvement in Spot and its military version, Helios. Airbus Defence and Space is also involved in ERS, which monitors our planet's environment, and the SoHO programme, which is trying to reveal the secrets of the sun. The electronic brain of Ariane is also produced in Toulouse.

3850,"&gt; When ASML was about to bankrupt few years ago, Intel, Samsung and TSMC are the ones who bailed them out, not the EU.       
              
I'm not sure where you heard that because it's just wrong, ASML wasn't ""bankrupt"" when Intel (mainly) invested to accelerate EUV development in 2012, their traditional photolithography system business was very profitable at that time. You can look up their [2012 financial results](https://www.asml.com/en/investors/annual-report/2012) since they're a public company, FY 2012 net income was at ‚Ç¨1.3 billion.          
ASML had issues in 2008 when the entire semiconductor industry took a hit for obvious reasons, but at that time the company mainly relied on relief from the Dutch government.          
                      
Also ASML has been a big beneficiary of EU research programs over the years, of note is the [EUCLIDES project](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/28160/results) which among other outcomes helped determine EUV lithography feasibility. You can search on CORDIS for ASML, they've been part of many other publicly funded research projects, other examples: [SeNaTe](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/662338), [TAKE5](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/692522/reporting), [IT2](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/875999), etc.",Romania,/r/europe/comments/oph35i/eu_wants_a_bigger_share_of_the_microchips_market/h67njlb/,Candriu,1627013898

3885,"**Context**: 

With Serbia already much aggrandized by the two Balkan Wars (1912‚Äì13, 1913), Serbian nationalists turned their attention back to the idea of ‚Äúliberating‚Äù the South Slavs of Austria-Hungary. Colonel Dragutin Dimitrijeviƒá, head of Serbia‚Äôs military intelligence, was also, under the alias ‚ÄúApis,‚Äù head of the secret society Union or Death, pledged to the pursuit of this pan-Serbian ambition. Believing that the Serbs‚Äô cause would be served by the death of the Austrian archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir presumptive to the Austrian emperor Franz Joseph, and learning that the Archduke was about to visit Bosnia on a tour of military inspection, Apis plotted his assassination. Nikola Pa≈°iƒá, the Serbian prime minister and an enemy of Apis, heard of the plot and warned the Austrian government of it, but his message was too cautiously worded to be understood.

At 11:15 AM on June 28, 1914, in the Bosnian capital, Sarajevo, Franz Ferdinand and his morganatic wife, Sophie, duchess of Hohenberg, were shot dead by a Bosnian Serb, Gavrilo Princip. The chief of the Austro-Hungarian general staff, Franz, Graf (count) Conrad von H√∂tzendorf, and the foreign minister, Leopold, Graf von Berchtold, saw the crime as the occasion for measures to humiliate Serbia and so to enhance Austria-Hungary‚Äôs prestige in the Balkans. Conrad had already (October 1913) been assured by William II of Germany‚Äôs support if Austria-Hungary should start a preventive war against Serbia. This assurance was confirmed in the week following the assassination, before William, on July 6, set off upon his annual cruise to the North Cape, off Norway.

The Austrians decided to present an unacceptable ultimatum to Serbia and then to declare war, relying on Germany to deter Russia from intervention. Though the terms of the ultimatum were finally approved on July 19, its delivery was postponed to the evening of July 23, since by that time the French president, Raymond Poincar√©, and his premier, Ren√© Viviani, who had set off on a state visit to Russia on July 15, would be on their way home and therefore unable to concert an immediate reaction with their Russian allies. When the delivery was announced, on July 24, Russia declared that Austria-Hungary must not be allowed to crush Serbia.

Serbia replied to the ultimatum on July 25, accepting most of its demands but protesting against two of them‚Äînamely, that Serbian officials (unnamed) should be dismissed at Austria-Hungary‚Äôs behest and that Austro-Hungarian officials should take part, on Serbian soil, in proceedings against organizations hostile to Austria-Hungary. Though Serbia offered to submit the issue to international arbitration, Austria-Hungary promptly severed diplomatic relations and ordered partial mobilization.

War was in fact declared on July 28, and Austro-Hungarian artillery began to bombard Belgrade the next day.",Romania,/r/europe/comments/opuvge/23_july_1914_austriahungary_issues_a_series_of/h67p53f/,filosoful,1627014898

3923,"The divide between higher and lower income countries will probably be even more significant this year, as less of the athletes from richer countries will have had Covid in the past year (which reduces performance due to lost practice time and occasionally lung damage) thanks to better public health systems and greater/earlier vaccine availability.

The same team that was regularly winning gold in the 4x100m and performing well in the 4x400m will likely not be able to field eligible teams this year as so many of their athletes have seen their performances dip this year due to covid infection and inability to practice properly during lockdown.

4011,"Serbian partisans fought Chetniks not because they disagreed with Serbian Chetniks/national socialists on the fate of other ethnicities in a Serb-dominated state but because they disagreed with monarchism and wished Bolshevism to be the ruling ideology of an essentially Serb state. Unsurprisingly, non-Serbs of the time took very little interest in what was a war among Serbs who considered them enemies. The few Bosniaks in the partisans fought under Serbian nom de guerres and religious ones (ie. all of them) were barred from serving in the partisans at all, a convenient way of discriminating against them institutionally. Tito's state did not even extend recognition to Bosniaks until the 60s, yet brag about its multiethnic credentials.

Foca circa 1941 and 1942 is one of the hot spots where the completely fabricated ""antifascist"" historiography falls apart. During the offensives in January and February by the NDH against joint partisan and Chetnik bandits, who were supposedly fighting each other, the partisan elements fled en massed to Italian fascist controlled territory and exchanged star-bearing cockades for skulls and daggers where they were fully recruited into Chetnik units.

The ""antifa"" narrative of ""Yugoslavs"" with cockade berets of all ""ethnicities"" charging into battle against German ""occupiers"" and their fascist ""puppets"" holding three striped flags is mythological, completely invented, a fairytale, just like every one of the nonexistent, fabricated ""Seven Enemy Offensives"" fought off by the semi-literate Tito.",,/r/europe/comments/mmqpwu/croatia_to_ban_ustashe_fascist_nazi_and_chetnik/h66tau1/,Dull_Impression_9831,1626998024

4036,"&gt; Actually there very much is a single unified Orthodox church.

[That's an oversimplification.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oriental_Orthodox_Churches)

&gt; Patriarchs are nothing more than administrators and janitors. 

Which is exactly what the Bishop of Rome was in originally: The Patriarch of the Latin Church, nothing more.

As for the title of Pope, it was used to refer to any senior bishop during the late antiquity and it's first recorded use being in relationship to Patriarch Heraclas of Alexandria in 248. It only became the official title for the bishop of Rome in the 11th century.

And even then, the Bishop of Rome only became more than ""just"" the Patriarch of the Latin church over the course of many centuries... For instance, the doctrine of papal infallibility in matters of church doctrine only started to be argued for in the 13th century, and only become accepted Church dogma in the XIX century.

&gt; Greek Orthodox, Romanian Orthodox, etc only tells you what country the church is from and what language to expect during service. That's it. Aside minor local customs, like people dressing in a certain way or men and women standing in certain parts of the church, that's the entire amount of difference between the churches.

Up until 1962, Catholic services where performed in Latin... Because, again, the Catholic Church was the Latin Church.

Where people stood in church, the overall structure of the rituals and how the priests and parish stood and  how they dressed was also fairly uniform all throughout the Catholic world up until 1962, AFAIK... Because, again, it was all the same Latin Church lead by the same Patriarch of Rome.

Where I'm trying to get at, is that you seem to be comparing the Orthodox Church to the Catholic Church and highlighting their similarities, when in reality what similarities exist today between the Catholic Church and the various Orthodox Churches... them being one of unity in doctrine with tolerance for divergent customs an practices... are all fairly recent radical departure from how the Catholic Church operated throughout most of it's history, and much more in line with the spirit of ecumenical council found in the Orthodox Churches.

&gt; Moreover the Orthodox Church is forbidden to support any form of offensive military action whatsoever and in the one and only instance where 2 orthodox countries were ever at war with each other (the second Balkan war) the church was not allowed to support it at all.

Same as in the Latin Christianity, in theory.

4080,"Veljko Belivuk, the head of a criminal group suspected of several brutal liquidations, denied that he was a murderer at the hearing in the prosecutor's office two weeks ago, but spoke about his alleged relationship with Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic and other people from the top of the Serbian Progressive Party. As he said, Vuƒçiƒá and his associates asked him for more services - to control that the Partizan tribunes do not chant against the president, to intimidate those who organized protests against the government, to ensure peace at the Pride Parade, but also to influence taxi drivers to cancel protests against the application for transport ""CarGo"", it is written in the transcript of Belivuk's interrogation, which was obtained by KRIK.
  
Writes: Milica Vojinoviƒá
  

  
At the beginning of August, the Prosecutor's Office for Organized Crime is expected to file an indictment against Veljko Belivuk aka Velja Nevolja, the leader of the hooligan-criminal group ""Principi"", which worked within the Montenegrin Kavac clan.
  

  
Belivuk is suspected of being behind five brutal murders, one torture and drug dealing, and photos of the decapitated and butchered bodies of his victims have been published by government officials on several occasions . The Belivuk clan is considered one of the most brutal in the region.
  

  
It is also characteristic of this criminal group that they have had strong contacts in the country for years - primarily in the police and politics, which KRIK and other media have previously written about.
  

  
KRIK journalists have now obtained a transcript of Belivuk's hearing in the prosecution on July 5, which may deepen this story. He first briefly said that he was not a criminal but a ""fan leader"" and that he was not responsible for the murders, kidnappings and drug trafficking, but he did not want to answer the prosecutor's questions about that. On his own initiative, however, he started talking about relations with people in power. 
  

  
""I decided to say everything nicely about my relationship with the President of Serbia, Aleksandar Vuƒçiƒá, the Minister of Police, Aleksandar Vulin, Vuƒçiƒá's brother, friends, godparents and all other politicians who asked us for services, and now pretend not to know each other and wash their hands of us, ""Belivuk told the prosecutor.
  

  

  
Miljkovic and Belivuk (photo: screenshot)
  
During the almost half-hour interrogation, he listed the various services he allegedly performed for the president and his people, and listed the names of the SNS members he met. He said that he maintained contact with President Vuƒçiƒá mostly through the hooligan Aleksandar Vidojeviƒá, better known as Aca Ro≈°avi, who is a friend of the president's son , but also that he allegedly saw Vuƒçiƒá several times in person.
  

  
He also threatened to tell more details in the future ""if certain people do not come to their senses.""
  

  
Although it is difficult to assess what is true and what is not from what Belivuk said, some details coincide with what was previously assumed - that his group had a role in suppressing the protests, as well as relations with people in power. In his statement, however, Belivuk did not mention all the people from the police and the ruling party that journalists had previously revealed were close to him.
  

  
KRIK called on President Vuƒçiƒá for comment, and his media advisor Suzana Vasiljeviƒá told us that he would not give statements about this while the investigation is ongoing. We invited others that Belivuk mentioned, but none of them wanted to comment.
  

  
""The boss has a big problem""
  

  
Belivuk told the prosecutor that he had been a member of the Serbian Progressive Party since 2011.
  

  
He explained that his arrest in 2016, due to suspicion that he participated in the murder in the center of Belgrade, led to politicians losing control over the Partizan tribune. He was later acquitted in this case under mysterious circumstances - some evidence was compromised, and the expert suddenly changed his statement. 
  

  
Belivuk said that the hooligan Aleksandar Vidojevic, better known as Aca Roshavi, told him in 2017 that he would be his connection with the President of Serbia.
  

  
""Vidojevic told me that the Chief, as we called Vucic, has a big problem at the Partizan tribune, which arose as a result of my going into custody in 2016. That Andrej, Aleksandrov's brother, has control over the 'Alcatraz' fan group, but that they don't have the strength to bring anything out, that he also controls a part of the fans' tribune called 'Kimijevci', but that they only spend money and contribute nothing, and yes they actually have no control. The idea was to create a new fan faction that would unite all that so that the situation would be like at Zvezda's stadium. (‚Ä¶) We did it. ‚Äù
  

  

  
Belivuk (far left) and Vidojevic (far right) photo: Facebook
  
After some time, Belivuk, as he says, lost confidence in Vidojevic.
  

  
""We have begun to suspect that Roshavi is not passing on everything to the Chief as he is, that is, that he attributes more credit to himself for some solved tasks.""
  

  
Belivuk claims that he then complained to Darko Glisic, the president's godfather and one of the key people of the SNS, when he says that he is his 'longtime friend'. 
  

  
""He invited me to Ub with him, since he is the president of the municipality there. Marko Miljkoviƒá (Belivuk's right hand) and I went there, we had a constructive meeting where he explained to me how he heard from the Boss, how the Boss confirmed that Ro≈°avi, Acko as they call him, is a direct connection, that I don't need to we see each other directly (with Vuƒçiƒá) so as not to endanger the whole situation. ""
  

  

  
Darko Glisic (photo: opstinaub.org.rs)
  
At the same meeting, he claims, Gli≈°iƒá complained about the problems he had with Dijana Hrkaloviƒá , then one of the key people in the police.
  

  
""Diana had against me, I don't know what, she stripped (our) women naked at every search. He said that they also have a big problem, that Diana is a great enemy of the Vuƒçiƒá family and that they do not know how to solve it. ""
  

  
At one of the next meetings, he told the prosecutor, Glisic said at Belivuk's insistence that he would personally organize a meeting with Vucic.
  

  
""He gave me contact with members of the BIA with whom I should talk, and they will tell me when and where we see each other.""
  

  
According to Belivuk, the meeting with Vuƒçiƒá was held in a private apartment in Zvezdara. Allegedly, the president's security was waiting in front - while Vuƒçiƒá himself talked to Belivuk and Miljkoviƒá in the apartment.
  

  
""There were various topics and there were a couple more of those meetings. At the first meeting, he told us that our vision would be reduced as much as possible, as much as possible, so that we would not endanger him or ourselves due to the political situation. ""
  

  
""Services""
  

  
Belivuk claims that at those meetings, Vuƒçiƒá asked him for different things.
  

  
One of the specific services that Belivuk describes in his defense is that he allegedly contributed to the failure of one of the scheduled protests of taxi drivers who rebelled against the competitive application for transport ""CarGo"".
  

  
""He asked me to influence the taxi drivers not to hold a (protest), because 'CarGo' is a friendly company. I asked: 'How can Ustashas, ‚Äã‚ÄãCroats in translation, be friends?', Since it was in the newspapers that it was their company. He said that I do not talk nonsense when I do not know, that the brother of Prime Minister Ana Brnabiƒá participated in the development of that program and that we must help Ana because she does a lot for the family and the country itself, which we did, the strike was not held. ‚Äú
  

  
He mentioned several other services that his group allegedly did for Vuƒçiƒá.
  

  
""We made it possible for him, his family members, his friends not to sing, not to raise slogans, not to come (hooligans) to gay parades, to appear at (SNS) rallies in order to make the rally popular.""
  

  
Belivuk says that they also used it to intimidate those who are protesting against Vuƒçiƒá.
  

  
""They used our names in threats when there were counter-rallies - that Marko and I would do everything for them if they showed up, and that definitely worked because many of those rallies were canceled and interrupted.""
  

  
Vuƒçiƒá allegedly asked Belivuk to prevent the raising of an insulting banner against the daughter of the director of the football club ""Red Star"", Zvezdan Terziƒá, which the fans planned to do in the stands during the match.
  

  
""I said that there were four hours until the start of the game, that it was physically impossible to stop, to which I was told as if from a cannon that the Chief was telling me that he knew I could do it, the only question was whether I would. In such a situation, you are not left with much choice. After about two hours, before the start of the match, our lawyer Dejan Lazareviƒá came with the same request, but he was called by Zvezdan Terziƒá. We did it. After two days, Marko Miljkoviƒá, me and Lazareviƒá met Terziƒá, where he thanked us unconditionally and asked how much the service cost. We said that it was done as a service and that it can't cost anything for friends. """,,/r/europe/comments/opqic5/arrested_mafia_leader_confesses_he/h66vd2v/,stella_rossa,1626999118

May never understood the problem of her smart border. The main flaw they all have is that you need to find a way to deal with rogue traders. In fact, if you only have honest traders, you don't even need a border. Everyone simply pinky swears and does a declaration online. But then how do you

\- stop companies from cheating the system (ex Tesco truck for Belfast Tesco is ok, but that truck is not allowed to drive to Dublin)

\- or the actual smuglers. They are not going to fill in electronic declarations. 

So you need some way to inspect vehicles. Spot checks to check whether the regular traders don't abuse the system, and to filter out smugglers. That means either surveillance or physical checks. Neither will be tolerated by the Irish/NI.

So remind yourself: everytime someone utters the word ""smart border""or ""electronic border""see if their system actually covers the rogue elements. Because otherwise its simply more admin for honest traders.

It was the son of Iranian asylum seekers, yes?

No, you did try to hide it. Turns out his thoughts about his place in society and his heritage played a huge part in the crime.

4227,"&gt;The EU exists because the previous arrangement was worse. In this question the current arrangement is, for those countries, better. It's cheaper and their ally in the deal is far more capable.

The same applies here. Even when just asking a contribution equal to the GDP percentage of the lowest military budget in the EU, and even if the resulting force is strictly limited to defense of the EU territory, it would still be added value compared to the current situation.

&gt;Why does Belgium give it higher support than anywhere in Eastern Europe? Because, as with anything else, the top-level infrastructure would inevitably be in Belgium.

On the contrary, because Belgium is already well endowed with EU institutions (and SHAPE) the central command would be elsewhere, if only to make it harder to do a decapitating strike. I assume Czechia, because of its central position, as far as possible from any coasts, and because it's a Western Eastern European country which should satisfy all sensitivities. And there probably is a mountain that can be hollowed out.

4306,"&gt; ublic sector spending in Romania is already obscenely obese.

https://www.statista.com/statistics/263220/public-spending-ratio-in-eu-countries/

Romania has the **THIRD LOWEST PUBLIC IN THE EU**. 

&gt; The public administration is hugely oversized and wasteful, because it's used to channel public funds to politicians' relatives and sympathizers, by employing them in redundant positions with juicy salaries and pensions.

Wtf are you even talking about? No fucking public money goes to politician's relatives (or if it does it's minimal). Bribes are not from friggin public money. 

Public spending by and large in all European countries are dominated by social spending, health care, education and maybe a lil bit infrastructure.

https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/infographs/cofog/

Romania spends jack shit on social spending (average pension is 100 euros), health care again nothing (20 people died the past year in 4 hospital fires), education spending ... that again isn't happening teachers are paid a pittance, infrastructure ... again no.

4335,"He has demanded a lot of stuff, and a few things have been granted to him, most of these things in order to make running the prison around him easier. 

Due to the very substantial risk that another inmate would kill him without hesitation, the absolute majority of his time is in solitary confinement in his cell. He is allowed yard-time apart from the other inmates. He has access to a ""gym cell"" (threadmill and an exercise bike) because it is easier than to have him access the gym when not in use by the general population. He has access to library supplies, because it is easier than to have him access the library when not in use by the general population. He gets visitations from someone appointed by the state (a priest I believe, although I can't remember the details) once a week. That is his only contact with other people, apart from prison staff, and whoever might be his attorney at this time. 

And he will be spending the next indefinite amount of years this way. Some time, perhaps in 2041 or 2046 or 2051, a court will consider psychiatric evaluations, and declare him to no longer be a threat to society, and decide to not extend his confinement any further. 

This will allow his release from the prison system. And some people will ask whether that is ""justice served"". Failing to consider that he will most likely have changed his name to allow him anonymity. He will most likely be living under what today is called a ""Code 6 strictly confidential address"" meaning that apart from law enforcement and public health services, nobody in the world will have anything a PO-box address for correspondence.

By then he will be a man in his sixties or seventies with no skills allowing employment. He will have had next to no lifelong income, and will eventually be granted a minimum pension by the welfare system. He will most likely live out the rest of his life in a very cheap rented apartment, as some old, grey antisocial being who nobody really knows who is. 

If he ever leaves prison alive, he will literally have to become nobody. Because once he is out of the prison system, he can never admit who he is, because there will always be the risk that someone out there will still be carrying a grudge over what he did to someone close to them.",Norway,/r/europe/comments/op8cxr/today_marks_10_years_since_the_july_22nd_attacks/h65ibb6/,Niqulaz,1626976518

No, but now we have Amazon having a gargantum ""GDP"", paying tiny amount of taxes, and people struggling to pay their rent and maintain their infrastructure, so now folks end up wanting them to pay more, liking left-wing populism, or even identifying as communist.

They oppressed and killed millions of people.

That has nothing to do with what I said at all. It's no surprise that they killed the nazi's because they were at war.

The power to control Russian exports of energy. I have said this multiple time. Are you illiterate?

&gt;The only bargaining power versus Russia they has is because they get gas from the EU networks, which is imported from Russia anyway.

aka. you don't know what the fuck you are talking about.

&gt;Quite hypocritical that Poland is complaining about Germany building more import capacity while they are using that capacity themselves, and are more depedent than Germany on Russian import.

Lmao, Poland is buying more and more of it's gas from Norway each year. As it's LNG terminal expansion opens, it will get more from Norway and America.

If you're speaking militarily; then Chiang should not have stabbed the communists in the back during the Northern Expedition and later again in the Second Sino-Japanese War. That move led to alienating half the country and the Soviets backed CCP and gave them Manchuria and all the equipment there to win the Chinese Civil War.

The thing about [The Three Principles of the Peoples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Principles_of_the_People) is to first unite the country, second, teach the people about democracy, third, establish welfare for the people.

Both KMT &amp; CCP is said to be alligned by the 'Three Principles of the People'.

And of course to end the one-party-rule and establish democratic elections, which took Taiwan waaay to long(1996).

5022,"I feel like you are focusing on a later part of history than I would like. Isn't it true that there was a wealth disparity between east and west even in the middle ages? Given this, discussion of the Americas is unnecessary, because that could be be seen as those countries pressing their advantage, but the essential question is where the advantage originates. 



Thanks for mentioning the wars of religion, I think that's definitely a big part of it which I hadn't thought about. The enlightenment is a pretty airy-fairy reason surely, because it could be seen as a symptom of increased wealth and learning rather than a cause of it, and I don't know of any reason preventing it from spreading east. Likewise, the plague surely would have had a universal impact.


Do you know if serfdom was present in eastern Europe, or just exclusive to Russia? I think that's a significant question. Surely, another factor that strengthened serfdom was the large Russian plain, with nowhere to escape to from the army if the serfs rebelled, as well as the hostile winters perhaps. I don't disagree with your points on this of course.



The high German population density (as opposed to pure population) is what I'm saying was a big factor. I find it hard to agree that the Ruhr played much of a role or pre-coal, and anyway, German states were pretty much independent in the middle ages, but mostly prospered nonetheless. So my theory is that they prospered due to proximity to the wealthier and more advanced West, as well as their population densities, with common culture filling in the cracks of the wealth spread. 



Finally, it's also possible that the fragmented nature but ultimate unity of the holy Roman empire led to lots of internal competition without it turning into total war, thus providing both stability as well as competition and innovation. This has got to do with my theory (not claiming this is original, just that I haven't seen it mentioned) that the fragmented nature of Europe is what led to it's technological and societal development.",,/r/europe/comments/onad2x/death_toll_of_wwii_in_europe/h639wue/,aghicantthinkofaname,1626927563

5035,"&gt;embargo with what navy? 

 Fair enough on that one, although constructing one isn't out of the realm of possibility when you would influence the entire globe  

&gt;Besides, 85% of our GDP is produced internally.  

Just casually losing nearly 3.5 trillion dollars while your enemy grows to unimaginable strength, nothing to worry about ofc. 


&gt;Im advocating for the *exact opposite * of taking on the globe. The globe should take care of its own business. China becoming too powerful? Fucking do something about it. The entire globe can‚Äôt take on a country built on debt with no natural resources, a baby bomb ready to go off in a decade and a half ass untrained navy to secure resources? You need mommy America to take care of you? 

What? Describe to me exactly what you mean by ""fucking do something about it"" the globe isn't a singular entity or country.

Also calling china a country with no recourse is probably the funniest thing I've heard in this thread, (not even mentioning the fact that China has major influence is all of Africa already, so even if it where true, it wouldn't matter)

You seem to think that the only way china can influence the world is through war, and while it can work with they're ludicrous population, economy and Russian ally, it's by no means their only option, in reality they make other countries be dependent on them, and unlike others, some countries can't afford a 3.5 trillion dollar hit to their GDP so they side with them out of necessity.

&gt;Fuck off all I hear from Europeans is how we‚Äôre this 3rd world Fascist blight consuming the world with violence and instability. So go ahead and take our job, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll do great.

5039,"&gt;BMI fucking sucks.

On that we can agree. I'm 1.86 and like the gym, so perma-overweight BMI for me. Useless measure unless you have eyes on the person.

I keep updating that site and I'm seeing some really mixed signals; still not convinced they're not outright lying about one parameter or the other in many cases.

&gt;With size36 **I was doing mild excercise in the form of light weights (35kg) and light excercise twice a week. I wasn't a gym rat at all and it knocked me down 2 sizes** without a difference in weight. 

Please make this clear to everyone you meet. Losing fat/weight is the opposite of hard and can be done on your livingroom floor. 

Back in 2009 I weighed 100kg in fat due to an accident where I couldn't do much for a year in terms of training, yet still retained the appetite of a gym-rat. It took me 3-4 months on a bike to reduce it to 75 while having a lot of fun.

Japan came out of centuries long isolation from the rest of the world at the end of the 19th century, got some Modernization with the Meiji Restoration, and along came the civil war in China, which Japan and their aspirations of becoming a superpower became a war powerhouse that couldn't be stopped in China's weak state.

This attracted the eyes of the WORLD, this small little island taking on CHINA, and winning at that! But then the US said if Japan were to extend past Indo-China, trade embargos would be in effect. Meanwhile Japanese AMBASSADORS are in Washington D.C. discussing the Washington Naval treaty and the Japanese Military just about had it with America and sent planes over to Pearl Harbor.

Not to say Pear Harbor was a case of the US overstepping their authority, as it often does happen that way, but looking back at the Second Sino-Japanese war, it was the right call.

5199,"Bantry Basketball Club announced today that actress and model Emily Ratajkowski has sponsored the club for the upcoming season.

Ratajkowski, who has starred in films such as Gone Girl and has had a very successful modelling career, has sponsored the Bantry team through her clothing brand, inamorata.


The announcement isn't out of nowhere - Ratajkowski has long had a gr√° for the Rebel County.

The American model spent her childhood summers at her parents' holiday home in Bantry, and has regularly returned over the past few years since gaining widespread fame. You only need to scroll through her Instagram feed to find old photos of nature trails and the like from County Cork.



This isn't Ratajkowski's first interaction with basketball in Bantry either. In 2018, she sent a tweet out that surely confused most of her American followers, congratulating Colaiste Pobail Bheanntra√≠ on winning the All-Ireland Senior Boys basketball championship.


Ratajkowski has also spoken before about her Irish ancestry, and even a simple Wikipedia search reveals her middle name to be ""O'Hara"". She appeared on the Late Late Show in 2014, where she revealed she knew one word in Irish - ""ci√∫nas"" - which her friend had taught her because she ""talks too much"".


The sponsorship deal covers Bantry's U15/U16 boys' team. The amateur club at Bantry run several underage teams, as well as their senior sides, who recently returned to training.



Ratajowski's 1.5m Twitter followers and 27.9m Instagram will surely bring a fair amount of exposure to Bantry Basketball Club if any acknowledgment of the deal comes from her official accounts.

We've seen some iconic sponsors on jerseys in the past, but we think it will be hard to trump Emily Ratajkowski's clothing brand appearing on Bantry Basketball's vests. Time will tell whether it will bring them luck in the coming months.

TLDR: there is a team of very happy under 16s in Bantry.",,/r/europe/comments/op21w0/ireland_emily_ratajkowski_is_the_new_sponsor_of/h62ensw/,thatbigballonthen7,1626911477

5209,"&gt;It's you who doesn't understand. Heritage is an amalgamation of many things. Buildings, culture and much more. This part you understand. But what you miss is that taking away one of these things can already drastically change that heritage. Not destroy or wipe out, but change. And that change, if significant enough, is enough to warrant revoking the UNESCO heritage status. Especially considering UNESCO heritage is by definition exceptional and thus a fragile status when it comes to changes.

It's an amalgamation as you say, based on multiple differing areas and yet you are the one making the argument that one specific dock out of the many that are still kept in good condition in their original manner is enough to significantly change the culture and heritage of a city.

The idea that Liverpool has multiple docks that all are in good standing and kept in their historical conditions and yet building a stadium in one of the docks most people even in the city don't know exists in a redevelopment that will actually renovate two really old buildings which people have never been able to visit and yet the argument is being made this one development which actually gives people far greater access to the cities culture and history to the likes we haven't seen before is being made in a manner that detracts from the cities heritage, it just doesn't make sense.

&gt;If the central point of your heritage application is that it was a highly important historic port, and you then proceed to add new buildings in such a way that the defining factor of the area starts to shift to the modern buildings, you lose a central argument for the area's heritage status. It's not just about a mix of modern and historical, it's about how prominent the heritage buildings are.  
&gt;  
&gt;The precedent that this decision sets is that if there's no thought put into exactly what kind of modern building can be placed in a heritage site while keeping the focus of the area on the historical buildings, you eventually get to a point where you lose the heritage status. A perfectly reasonable point of view, if you ask me.

The problem with your argument is that the primary landmarks on that waterfront the ones that are defining over the area aren't the large buildings in the backdrop but actually the smaller and more imposing buildings right on the water front like the Port Authority Building the Albert Docks and the Liver Building, again referring again to my previous comment the Liver Building is a reason we got a heritage status and yet if these rules and the organisation existed back then we'd of never had many of these buildings which got us the status in the first place.

If you don't see an issue with the fact that the system which is used to judge whether you have a heritage in the first place would of blocked the buildings which actually won you the heritage status then there isn't much I can do to help you with that, but it's clearly a flawed system.

&gt;Again, the heritage status was based on the history of Liverpool as an important trading port, as well as architectural influences. I don't even think I have to explain why the prominence of the actual port buildings is important to preserve this status.

Again, take a look at the pictures of Liverpool and try and make that argument - there are far more listed historical buildings in view than modern buildings and your going to tell me that if you find a picture the dominating buildings aren't the Liver Building, Port Authority Building and The Cunard Building because if you are it's quite clear your simply ignoring those buildings.",,/r/europe/comments/oonve2/liverpool_stripped_of_unesco_world_heritage/h62f423/,BenJ308,1626911704

5258,"&gt;The deal is clearly not working as intended 

The goal of the deal was to keep Northern Ireland in the EU market to avoid a border with the Republic. Doing this means that there will have to be customs checks between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, which inevitably leads to longer processing times and complicates commerce, that is what a customs border means, that is what we have on the English channel and what is happening on the Irish sea. All of this wasn't just foreseeable, it was obvious, so, yes, the protocol is working as intended. 

What I see is a few supermarket chains that don't seem to have planned for this and just assumed they could keep things running with no changes, a problem that has possibly been exacerbated by a lack of preparation from British customs (though the second part is uncertain).

But, ... they did. Even the Atlantistes who want to cooperate with the US often think that slightly under 50% of the US is a lost cause. In fact, the US's soft power took a beating under Trump and even supporters of authoritarian regimes like to use him as a comparison.

Right or wrong, this is one case where there isn't a double standard. If anything, I don't recall a lot who tried to clarify that it's not the whole US who supported Trump.

5361,"Maybe in hospitals, sure. But there aren't many areas in which it really is *that* important in the sense of every single employee needing to be vaccinated... As long as enough people are protected against the virus, forcing everyone to do it is completely and utterly unnecessary. In a hospital you're in direct contact with vulnerable patients, making it a much more serious necessity to be vaccinated than anywhere else. For comparable situations (think of elderly homes) I could get behind a special need for vaccinations, but beyond that... no. In principle it is everyone's personal choice unless there is a specially pressing reason to overrule that human right.

In almost every single country, the minimum required amount of vaccinations to achieve group immunity will be reached with the normal vaccine campaign. Society is then sufficiently protected. Only in countries with exceptional anti-vaccer presence will this not be reached. Then you're faced with the difficult situation of choosing between forcing vaccinations or respecting everyone's bodily autonomy. I doubt any western country will actually be facing such a choice to begin with. Forcing vaccinations on people when the minimum vaccination percentage for group immunity is likely to be reached anyway is even worse. We don't need to be overzealous with this. Human rights like bodily autonomy may only infringed upon if this is necessary. And if group protection can be reached through a regular vaccination campaign, then it is absolutely not necessary to force it upon people!

Also, not wanting to be vaccinated is not equivalent to ""spreading a virus willingly"", that's a charged way of defining it...

turkey never had a vote, that wanted a theocracy. You don't know shit, and still spitting bs. Do you think that every US citizen that voted for Trump was a racist bigot? Do you think that everyone who votes for Biden is a SJW?  The lack of alternatives is the main issue in turkey. 

conservative party (AKP=) 

nationalistic party (MHP)

Kemalistic party (CHP) 

Kurdish communistic party (HDP)  


there is some history between these kind of parties and their voters.   
Most kurds would't vote for the MHP or the CHP, because the Kemalist opressed the kurds, the MHP are nationalistic and don't like the kurdish autonomic desire.

the religous people have bad history with the kemalsit, so they wouldn't vote for the CHP. The Kemalist wouldn't vote for the AKP or the HDP.. and so on. 

The result is, there are not much alternatives for these people. Beside that that, the first half of Erdogans reign wasn't that bad.. Kurds got more rights from Erdogans party, than any other party have given them before. More people got ""freeish"" healthcare. Older people got better pensions and stuff. Infrastructure in less developt regions of turkey got better.. 

So there are some good thinks people still remember.

Apologies for defining it based on a relgiion, but since we divide religious art and architecture based on religion it is only natural that I used the different religions to explain why it's so significant. There aren't that many buildings that have this unique history. The Cathedral of Cordoba is another exmpla of a WHS that embodies this unique history of swapping religions. If we don't recognize how different religions come wtih unique artistic and architectural developments then we lose the reasons why the building was constructed in the first place.

5655,"U.S.-German Deal on Russia‚Äôs Nord Stream 2 Pipeline Expected Soon

The U.S. and Germany have reached an agreement allowing completion of the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline, officials from both countries say

The U.S. and Germany have reached an agreement allowing the completion of a¬†controversial Russian natural-gas pipeline, according to officials from Berlin and Washington, who expect to announce the deal as soon as Wednesday, bringing an end to years of tension between the two allies.

The Biden administration will effectively waive Washington‚Äôs longstanding opposition to the pipeline, Nord Stream 2, a change in the U.S. stance, ending years of speculation over the fate of the project, which has come to dominate European energy-sector forecasts. Germany under the agreement will agree to assist Ukraine in energy-related projects and diplomacy.

U.S. officials under the¬†previous two presidential administrations¬†opposed Nord Stream 2, out of fears it would heighten Moscow‚Äôs economic and political sway across Europe. The pipeline would allow the Kremlin to increase European dependence on its natural gas, then use it to blackmail U.S. allies, critics have said, charges Russia has dismissed.

President Biden, seeking closer ties with Europe and with Berlin in particular,¬†waived U.S. sanctions¬†against the Swiss-registered Russian pipeline firm, Nord Stream 2 AG, and its chief executive in May, signaling a change in the U.S. stance.

Mr. Biden continues to oppose the pipeline and views it as a Kremlin move to expand its influence over others, officials said Tuesday, but considers a united group of allies to be the most effective way to counter Moscow.

For Russia, the U.S.-Germany deal means it will be able to double the volume of natural gas exported directly to Germany via the pipeline beneath the Baltic Sea, while bypassing an existing route through Ukraine.

One person familiar with the talks said the deal was close to conclusion and expected in coming days. Another person familiar with the talks said the deal could be announced as early as Wednesday.

Under the four-point agreement, Germany and the U.S. would invest $50 million in Ukrainian green-tech infrastructure, encompassing renewable energy and related industries. Germany also would support energy talks in the Three Seas Initiative, a Central European diplomatic forum.

Berlin and Washington as well would try to ensure that Ukraine continues to receive roughly $3 billion in annual transit fees that Russia pays under its current agreement with Kyiv, which runs through 2024. Officials didn‚Äôt explain how to ensure that Russia continues to make the payments.

The U.S. also would retain the prerogative of levying future pipeline sanctions in the case of actions deemed to represent Russian energy coercion, officials in Washington said.

State Department spokesman Ned Price on Tuesday noted that Mr. Biden told German Chancellor Angela Merkel during a White House visit last week that ‚Äúwe continue to oppose the Nord Stream 2 pipeline,‚Äù while adding that the project was 90% complete when Mr. Biden took office and that officials didn‚Äôt think it could be stopped through sanctions.

German officials said they rejected a U.S. demand to include a so-called kill-switch clause in the pipeline‚Äôs operating rules. This would have enabled Berlin to suspend gas flows if Russia were to make aggressive moves toward its neighbors or Western allies. German negotiators argued that such state interference in a privately owned project could be the target of a legal challenge.

Berlin agreed instead not to reject future sanctions against the Russian energy sector, officials said.

The agreement between the Biden administration and Germany was described by officials in Berlin and Washington and by a congressional official familiar with the issue. Details of the agreement began circulating Monday evening, following a Reuters report on a possible deal.

Kyiv sees the existing gas-transit network in Ukraine and the revenue it brings as a check against Russia, especially after Moscow seized the Ukrainian region of Crimea and fomented rebellion in the country‚Äôs east in 2014. U.S. supporters of Ukraine have opposed any agreement permitting the construction of the pipeline.

‚ÄúAny deal that allows for the completion of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline is badly flawed,‚Äù said Pat Toomey (R., Pa.), the ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee. Mr. Toomey urged the administration to impose sanctions ‚Äúto halt Moscow‚Äôs efforts to weaponize the supply of gas in Europe.‚Äù

A focus of the forthcoming deal is the promotion of Ukrainian energy independence, said one of the people familiar with the talks, adding that the agreement ensures that Russia ‚Äúcannot use energy as a coercive tool against Ukraine or any nation.‚Äù

Despite the U.S. sanctions waiver in May, this person said the U.S. would continue to examine entities involved in the project and will make clear ‚Äúcompanies risk sanctions if they are involved in Nord Stream 2.‚Äù

Derek Chollet, a senior State Department policy adviser, is in Kyiv this week along with a German counterpart to inform Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky of the agreement‚Äôs details. Mr. Chollet is scheduled for a similar trip to Poland, which has vehemently opposed the pipeline.

Word of the deal has rankled Ukrainian officials, who view the existing pipeline network in their country as a rare point of leverage against Russia in the two countries‚Äô seven-year-old conflict. Last week, Mr. Putin delivered another in a series of polemics challenging Ukrainian sovereignty. Rendering the existing pipeline superfluous could offer Russia a freer military hand on Ukrainian territory, Ukraine advocates fear.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Tuesday that Mr. Biden told Ms. Merkel last week ‚Äúthat we have ongoing concerns about how the project threatens European energy security, undermines Ukraine‚Äôs security and the security of our‚Ä¶allies and partners.‚Äù

Ms. Psaki said Mr. Biden directed staffers to work jointly with German counterparts to complete an agreement.

An announcement of the deal was delayed to avoid eclipsing Ms. Merkel‚Äôs farewell visit to the White House, according to officials close to the negotiations. Ms. Merkel has made the completion of the pipeline, which could occur later this year, a signal achievement marking the close of her political career, people familiar with her thinking said.",,/r/europe/comments/oorx9g/germany_and_the_us_would_invest_50_million_in/h60l9ns/,TheLatis,1626883011

The Sahrawi towns of Guelmim, terfaya, Tan Tan, Assa and zag, just north of Western Sahara, have all joined Morocco upon its independence in 1956 with no problems. The Ifni region, home to the Ait Baamrane tribal confedearation which includes Sahrawi tribes, was reclaimed by Morocco in 1969 without any issues.  


All the founders of Polisario went to school in Rabat, Morocco and learned about marxism-leninism there, of course with the hatered of the pro-West imperialist Moroccan regime at the heart of what they learnt from their **fellow** Moroccan marxist students.  


The first people they approached for help with their nacent revolution were Moroccan leftist parties.   


We have recorded and written speeches by their mythical leader Mustappha el Wali, and none of them talk about an independent state in Western Sahara. They had the usual leftist ramblings and talked about fighting the spainish **occupation**, and then after Spain left, they talked about fighting the Moroccan and Mauritanian **imperialism.**   


If Polisario founders were given the choice between a united communist Morocco, and an independent Western Sahara, they would've taken the first choice, 100%, and if you believe otherwise you're wrong.  


They fought Morocco because it espoused the wrong ideology, no more no less.
