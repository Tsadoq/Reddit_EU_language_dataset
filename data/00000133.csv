15,"Slaves are homogenous.  Awesomeness is specialized.  Don't be a slave.  Inclusivity is a general filter that empowers organizations that know how to utilize it.  Not just for ""including the inclusive"", but as a means of sorting through massive populations to find the ones that are fit for purpose.  A lot of ""fit for purpose"" individuals live on the edge-cases.

For instance, blind people have advanced spacial processing abilities.  That doesn't get a lot of notice.  They have to be good at estimating speeds and distances in order to make their way through daily life.  The reward of accommodating blind people then becomes accommodating people who have a capacity for advanced spacial reasoning... and it has *all* its favorable correlates.

Disabled individuals have another superpower, too.  They passively prove the honesty and trustworthiness of your society.  If they can go through life without great suffering, they demonstrate every day which ways people are voluntarily not messing with them.  The people who are trivially easily messed with prove the resilience of their society whenever people don't mess with them.

Foreigners provide some of that superpower if society treats them well and works to integrate them.  They do acclimate eventually, so their ability to demonstrate the trustworthiness of society is temporary.  That isn't the end of the reward for tolerating them, as foreigners provide another superpower: they're another stream of sortable populations from which people fit for special purposes can be discovered.

Since inclusivity is a highly generic empowerment source, when utilized as a power source it tends to eventually magnify all the differences between organizations.  Perhaps the starkest example of this is that corrupt organizations need to find the most effectively corrupt people, while honest organizations need to find the most effectively honest people.  If both are highly inclusive, they'll sort between each other until one of them is *spectacularly* corrupt, and the other is *spectacularly* honest.  This is not going to make these organizations like and trust each other.  In this way, inclusivity can also be a dangerous fuel of conflict, when it is sorting populations for strongly opposed traits.

One of the only sane arguments for a homogenous society is that these splits occur all across the *interior* of a society, and can therefore magnify forces of internal contradiction within a society, leading to radical instabilities.  The counterargument here is: one of the ways you can benchmark societies against each other is in their ability to withstand internal contradiction created via inclusivity.  The more interior resilience that the society has, the more it can utilize the general filtration potential of inclusivity to empower itself before it cracks because of internal contradiction.

Internal contradiction is the basic destruction of all societies, largely because the efficacy of inclusivity leads to inclusivity expanding over time until it exceeds the resilience of the society utilizing it.  The alternative is not efficacious - incomplete specialization and a will to reject unexpected talents leads to a bland society with a tendency to lose capabilities over time, as well as leading to the likely accumulation of internal contradictions... as people inappropriately excluded tend to give their efficacy to black markets, criminal organizations, or dissident movements instead of lawful authorities!  This is a basic ""no win"" problem of human governance, though over time it has tended to create an ""arrow of progress"" which favors diversity as societies break entropically into forms that achieve tolerance.

The value of diversity is generally considered in a form that also increases society's capacity to withstand diversity, and it is thus a potentially coherent ideology.

One of the common sources of interior resistance is tolerance for highly divergent points of view, and thus societies with the power to placidly disagree with each other can survive much higher levels of inclusivity.  People who abuse others are generally contraindicated by diversity, which produces a subtler example of a powerful advantage that it provides...  You see, abusive people tend to redline tolerance factors, and thus remain acceptable only if their internal contradiction factors are very low.  Abusive people do not generally *have* low internal contradiction factors.  An ideology that relies on high interior resilience struggles to find any use for such people.  Inclusivity provides the filtration power to work past them even as it provides an ideological justification to do so.  This has created another less coherent ""arrow of progress"" as societies tend over time to gain quality in the way they treat each other, although this one admits more backsliding than the other arrow, and occasionally societies gain fanaticism instead should it happen that the local nasties *aren't* extensively contradictory to society or each other.",,/r/europe/comments/dp5icu/is_it_racist_to_want_your_country_to_stay/f5sn1fz/,ShengjiYay,1572437260

Or they said treat we'd sing a little spooky song or something.  Either way you'd be rewarded with some sweets.

Although It may have been on Halloween night after trick or treating was done and the younger kids had gone home, but I'm not sure.

Citroën purchased Maserati in 1968 with the intention of harnessing Maserati's high-performance engine technology to produce a true Gran Turismo car, combining the sophisticated Citroën suspension with a Maserati V6.
...
One SM had a Maserati V8 motor - this was a heavily used test bed developed by Maserati for the 1974 Maserati Quattroporte II.
...
After the 1974 bankruptcy of Citroën, Peugeot took ownership of the company and in May 1975, divested Maserati. Peugeot decided to stop building the SM, as sales were just 115 units that year.

The old-age dependency ratio was a little lower (33%), representing the ratio of the number of elderly people (aged 65 and over) compared to the number of people of working age.

At city level, Brussels is the youngest capital city in the EU with a young-age dependency ratio of over 40%, closely followed by Paris and Dublin (39%). In contrast, Lisbon, with an old-age-dependency ratio of over 41%, is the capital city with oldest citizens, ahead of Rome (36%) and Valletta (34%).

Youngest cities are in France and the United Kingdom

Young-age dependency ratios were highest in a large number of cities in France and the United Kingdom. The Communauté d’agglomération Val de France, near Paris (France), recorded the highest ratio (58%, 2014 data).

Germany and Romania – many cities with low shares of young people

The young-age dependency ratio in cities was below the EU average (35%) in Germany, Cyprus (2011 data), Lithuania, Luxembourg (2011 data), Malta, Austria, Poland (2014 data), Romania, Slovenia (2016 data) and Slovakia. Around two thirds of the 19 cities with the lowest ratios (below 25%) were in Romania or Germany.

&gt;**AMERICAN VISITORS TO Vienna are typically struck by the absence of homeless people on the streets.** And if they ventured around the city, they’d discover that there are no neighborhoods comparable to the distressed ghettos in America’s cities, where high concentrations of poor people live in areas characterized by high levels of crime, inadequate public services, and a paucity of grocery stores, banks, and other retail outlets.

&gt;Since the 1920s, **Vienna has made large investments in social housing** owned or financed by the government. But **unlike public housing in the United States, Vienna’s social housing serves the middle class as well as the poor, and has thus avoided the stigma of being either vertical ghettos or housing of last resort**. Every country in Western Europe has some version of social housing, but Vienna’s is by far the largest and most successful. It is typically ranked as one of the world’s most livable cities.",,/r/europe/comments/doufbx/homelessness_as_a_percentage_of_total_population/f5s8zxz/,lookatthesource,1572417209

&gt; Few people would place the Armenian genocide on their top ten -- or even top 1,000 -- list of the day's pressing issues. In fact, many Americans would likely be at a loss to explain who or what the Armenians are, much less what happened to them 90 years ago. Not so in Washington. For the past several years, U.S. representatives, lobbyists, and foreign emissaries have been locked in a vicious struggle over a resolution in Congress that would officially deemas genocide the massacre of up to 1.5 million ethnic Armenians in the Ottoman Empire. The Turkish government has fought this effor twith the zeal of Ataturk -- enlisting a multimillion-dollar brigade f former congressmen and slick flacks, as well as a coterie of American Jews surprisingly willing to downplay talk of genocide.  But the Armenian-American community has impressive political clout-- enough that a majority of House members have now co-sponsored the resolution. And that means a ferocious final showdown is looming, one so charged that this arcane historical dispute could even interfere with the war in Iraq.

-

&gt;The truth, as the Turks see it, is simple: There was no genocide.The Armenian death toll is exaggerated, and most died from exposure or rogue marauders during mass relocations. (One Turkish activist even cheerily assured me that, after the relocations, ""everyone was invited back."") The Turks say that the G-word implies an intent that can't be proved. This stance is more than just a matter of fierce national pride. The Turks are terrified at the prospect of huge financial and territorial reparations for the Armenians.(""[C]ash,"" drools one Armenian nationalist blogger, ""lots of cash."")
&gt;
&gt; So, instead of doling out lots of cash to the Armenians, Turkey showers Washington with political operators more than happy to argue their case -- for the right price. Few niches of Washington lobbying are as lucrative as the foreign racket, which explains why more than 1,800 lobbyists are currently registered to represent more than 660 overseas clients. Thus the Turks have found no shortage of willing pitchmen. Turkey currently maintains expensive contracts with at least four different Washington lobbying and p.r. firms. The result is that unsuspecting congressmen and staffers frequently find themselves badgered by well-heeled Turkish emissaries.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/doynf3/us_house_recognises_armenian_genocide/f5s9pta/,duisThias,1572418261

&gt;Soon after stepping down as chancellor, Schröder accepted Gazprom's nomination for the post of the head of the shareholders' committee of Nord Stream AG, raising questions about a potential conflict of interest.
&gt;
&gt; German opposition parties expressed concern over the issue, as did the governments of countries over whose territory gas is currently pumped.[75] In an editorial entitled *Gerhard Schroeder's Sellout*, the American newspaper The Washington Post also expressed sharp criticism, reflecting widening international ramifications of Schröder's new post.[76] Democrat Tom Lantos, chairman of the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs, likened Schröder to a ""political prostitute"" for his recent behaviour.[77] In January 2009, the Wall Street Journal reported that Schröder would join the board of the oil company TNK-BP, a joint venture between oil major BP and Russian partners.[78]
&gt;
&gt; In 2016, Schröder switched to become manager of Nord Stream 2, an expansion of the original pipeline in which Gazprom is sole shareholder.[79]
&gt;
&gt; In 2017, Russia nominated Schröder to also serve as an independent director of the board of its biggest oil producer Rosneft.[80] At the time, Rosneft was under Western sanctions over Russia’s role in the Ukraine crisis.[81] Schröder told Blick that he would be paid about $350,000 annually for the part-time post.[82] His decision caused an outcry in Germany and abroad, especially in a climate of fear about any potential Russian interference in the 2017 German elections.[83] German Chancellor Angela Merkel criticized her predecessor, saying ""I do not think what Mr Schröder is doing is okay"".[84]",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/dourx9/juncker_gets_farewell_present_from_serbian/f5s1o4b/,duisThias,1572408800

I've heard people talk about Chinese real estate purchases, but while they're often complaining about it (purchases in Vancouver particularly has affected the real-estate market enough to piss off a number of Canadians and result in legislation aimed specifically at quashing it), at least the way I've heard it put is not particularly nefarious.

China is undergoing rapid urbanization, and a lot of people made a lot of money by buying and building urban properties to accomodate that.  Problem is, people rammed prices up to levels where there wasn't much room for a return (I remember one article a few years back pointing out that the average price of a Beijing apartment had reached thirty years average wages in Beijing).  So...find some places other than China with real estate to put money in.

Sounds pretty expensive to me and I don’t know if there are laws which would allow constant surveillance. I get your point, though. They might come back on their own terms without police/intelligence agencies noticing. It’s a complicated matter, I see your points and mine. 

Some might fight back because of said approach. They might find other ways to communicate or will use media to say: I’m being oppressed since I’ve come back. Might appear in talkshows, media will have their headlines and quote laws and so on and on. A politician who’s overseeing this resort might have to step down.

[Wikipedia: List of Canada-United States border crossings: Closed land ports of entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Canada%E2%80%93United_States_border_crossings#Closed_land_ports_of_entry)

&gt; The Canadian port of entry operated until the late 1950s and the building is now a private residence. The US never had a border station at this location. This crossing has been barricaded since the 1970s. In recent years, thousands of migrants have made unauthorized entry into Canada on foot at this location so they can request asylum.[18] RCMP has established temporary facilities at this crossing to aid in processing the surge in asylum seekers.[19]

Seems like it'd be easier to go to an unstaffed, open crossing and just disregard the reporting requirements so that you don't have to hoof it.

555,"&gt; Oh and why stop there, i'm also an evil nazi and every historian who doesn't ascribe to your beliefs is also an evil nazi.  

Well, I am not the one throwing Nazi racial terms around and defending Nazi German soldiers.

But yeah. Many people in Germany during WW2 were Nazis or supported the Nazis. That is just historical fact. And the Nazis were evil. And that is not just me saying that. Good and evil are relative, and people rarely agree on them, but the vast majority of the human race can agree on one thing: That the Nazis were really pretty damn evil. 

From that, it logically follows that many Germans during the war were wrong. Even if they may not all have been ""evil Nazis"" themselves, they at least supported or did not resist the most despicable regime in human history. And that is indeed wrong, and which is something that the vast majority of Germans and the German state have acknowledged and made amends for.

But you instead appear to lack the either the historic knowledge or the empathy and human decency to place yourself back in those times in the place of the countless millions of victims of the Nazi German regime (like the little boy pictured in the OP). What kind of person would defend the monsters that caused such human suffering? A person like you apparently.

647,"This is the third post I have seen today, tastelessly disparaging Germans in general about something three or more generations ago and frankly, it's starting to irritate me. Should I simply write you off as a thief of Volkswagens? You are Polish, after all.

I am American. My great-great uncle was a P-51 pilot in what was then the Army Air Corps. He fought over North Africa and later over Europe. Undoubtedly, he killed a lot of Germans. He was shot down by the Luftwaffe somewhere in Austria, and was first held in a pilot prisoner camp near Sagan (now Zagan, Poland), and later in a makeshift prisoner camp in Langwasser, Nuremberg. He volunteered to fight in Europe's war because he believed it was the right thing to do. I think I would agree. I think this may have been the last time, or maybe the only time that the USA fought a war as the clear-cut ""good guy"". Even our own revolution is a mixed bag.

I went to Nuremberg a few months ago, to visit some people who have become good friends of mine.  I stood in the place where my relative was held captive in 1945 (Near the intersection of Breslauer Strasse and Gleiwitzer Strasse). It is now a residential neighborhood. I walked the streets of this ancient city,  with almost none of the original structures still standing after absolute annihilation from Allied bombing raids, and I saw people. They were normal people, living normal lives. They weren't savages or barbarians or boogeymen. They were humans, like all of us. 

It made me think about what it must have been like to live as a German under the Third Reich. For every diehard, anti-Semitic, genocidal fanatic; how many were caught in the middle of a government gone mad? How many were mothers? How many were children? How many were 18 or 19 years old, and found themselves drafted into a suicide mission to capture Stalingrad? How many saw reality for what it was and knew their own government had doomed them to die in a fire bombing?

In Nuremberg, there is a museum documenting the activities of the NSDAP in Nuremberg specifically, as well as Europe in general. It is built inside the former party rally grounds. Inside, one will find the typical stuff everyone has seen: the Nazi propaganda, the pictures of Stalingrad, the JU 87 formations ominously passing through a black-and-white sky. But one will also see the lesser known items, particularly the Anti-nazi materials of the 1930s. A lot of people saw it coming and tried their best to stop it. They knew what evil hid behind it. 

My point is simple: It's only after you dehumanize a group that people can be convinced to take part in something like the holocaust. We would be wise to remember that all of us are human, and any group could become the next Nazi Party under the right circumstances. It's easy to say that all of us would choose to do the right thing, to stand up to corruption or evil, but the fact is nobody knows what they would do if forced to make decisions at gunpoint, until it happens.

So yes, in the 1930s and 1940s it was the Germans committing atrocities. Before that, it was the British locking the Dutch boers into concentration camps. Before that, it was the Americans packing slaves into ships. Before that, it was the Spanish completely destroying mesoamerican cultures. This logic of Germans being somehow inherently bad or undeserving of human mercy simply does not stand, unless you apply it to every human.

729,"&gt; No matter the personal opinion on it, it certainly would be unique in Europe - no other country in the EU allows non-citizens to vote in general elections (local elections, sure, but GEs?

(imagine e.g. that British elders in Spain&amp;Portugal would try to use that to be allowed to vote in the Spanish/Portuguese general elections - that would cause quite a mess).

I would actually like the EU to take up something on this front. A system where if a citizen of EU country A is a long term resident of EU country B, they can choose to forfeit their voting rights in country A and instead vote in elections in B.

750,"Wagenknecht is in the minority with that position in her party. Ramelow and the Thuringian Left were not voted in by anti immigrants, on the contrary. Immigration no longer seems to be a hot button issue for now, instead the election was all about the rise of the far right on the one side, and anti climate protection policies on the other.

The Left won, because it absorbed votes from the minor centrist parties. The same thing benefited the parties of the ministers in the other two East German states that held the previous elections, CDU and SPD respectively. Both Parties outperformed the polls, because tactical voters wanted to prevent the AFD from becoming the majority party.

One difference to the other states is that The Left actually made gains compared to the previous election. I think this is simply because Ramelow is so popular in his state, similar to the Green's Kretschmann in Baden-Wuerttemberg (south west Germany). The CDU actually won the most direct mandates by far, but the statewide polls were won by a almost 10 percentage point margin by The Left.

The CDU did a bad job distancing itself from the AFD, so a lot of older voters switched to The Left. The Left for ideological reasons alone will never cooperate with the far right, and the far right's whole stick was to ""repeat the 89 revolution"" as all others parties are seen as SED like rulig class to overthrow or something, basically Trumpist anti establishmentism. I think that drove a lot of previously inactive voters to The Left as some sort of boomerang effect.

821,"I can give you my example. I don't know Lisbon enough to compare and may be it is easier (transport wise) there.

I live about 15 kms (straight line) to Porto center where most jobs are here. I pay 950 euros for a 2 bedroom apartment that has two buses only as public transportation to Porto. If by car it takes me about 50 minutes to get there during commute. I can also drive to Matosinhos and then take the metro, but timeframes will be similar.

I have been looking at apartments as my lease if coming up. A decent two bedroom apartment within 45-60 minute travel time runs at minimum for 600 euros, but I would say on average is 750-800 for a decent area [0]. You can find it for cheaper of course when you know someone close that is renting, etc, I'm going through online sites only here. I grew up on a known city for people to live that has nothing interesting to do, and people were paying 350-400 euros 10 years ago, now the same places are almost double.

And I don't think its is fair to compare to Stockholm. Let's do some very quick math. Average after taxes in Stockholm is 2450 euros, in Lisbon is 930 euros (I did the math with 14 months + the 'food allowance', for Stockholm I used google as I don't know how taxes work there).

if we use the 50% after tax for housing, while a Swedish person will pay more in total (1225 vs 465 euros), they will also have almost three times the disposable income after rent, and cost of living in Stockholm is not 3 times that in Lisbon, specially for necessities. I can compare to London, Birmingham, Amsterdam and South of Spain only, but I can say I never spent more than 10-15% on my day to day on bills + food in those places then I did in Portugal. 

And here is the other issue, and that a lot of people don't understand, for that 930 after tax, it costs the company €1,424.43 euros. Then on top of that, there is mandatory insurance, space, computers, etc, and you can easily see the money a company spends with an employee to be double what they take home (source, I have my own company and I see how much it costs to employ people when you take all the little taxes and things you have to pay for). All political parties have had the chance to make sure this money the companies pay are told to the employees in their receipts, but all of them fought to not do so (as it is easier to fool people how much the government really takes from you and doesn't want you to know)

836,"&gt; As of 1 January 2020, the Ministry of Defence will become the permission authority.

&gt; Finland is showing another symptom of its fear of foreigners.

&gt; A few months ago, the Government announced a new law to prohibit the access of citizens with dual nationality to officer posts in the Armed Forces. Now, authorities say they will require people from outside the European Union (EU) and the European Economic Area (EEA) a special permit if they want to buy real estate in the country.

&gt; Winter war syndrome? The fact that it is the Ministry of Defence (and not that of Finance or Economic Affairs), the department promoting the decision, confirms that this is not handled as an economic issue, but as a matter of national security.

&gt; The Ministry of Defence said on Monday that ""a comprehensive package of legislation will enter into force at the beginning of 2020, they key element of which is that buyers outside the EU and EEA need a permission to buy real estate in Finland"".

&gt; Furthermore, the new law allows the state ""to intervene if necessary, in the procurement of real estate when this is considered to be a threat to national security"".

&gt; As formulated in the previous sentence, it might seem that permits would be only necessary when acquiring real estate in security sensitive places, for example in border areas. But no, the Ministry of Defence specifies that non-Europeans will need permits to buy real estate in any case throughout Finland, with the exception of the Åland archipelago, which already has its own land acquisition legislation.

&gt; THE PERMISSION AUTHORITY

&gt; As of 1 January 2020, ""the Ministry of Defence will become the permission authority. It will process permission applications and make decisions on permissions in entire Finland with the exception of Åland Islands"", says the Government's release.

&gt; Buyers from outside the European Union and the EEA will have to apply for a permission before a real estate transaction or within two months after it. In the initial phase, buyers will need a form to submit their applications. Later, an electronic service system will be launched, the Ministry of Defence says.

&gt; Applications will also be subject to payment of an upfront processing fee, the amount of which will be confirmed at the end of 2019. The fee will be charged irrespective of the outcome of the application and will not be refunded if the permission is refused.

&gt; OBLIGED TO SPECIFY THE USE

&gt; Applicants shall indicate in their applications the intended use of the real estate. The Ministry of Defence will be entitled to request further information from the applicant if considers it necessary. Appeals against negative decisions may be made to and administrative court.

&gt; People with dual nationality will not need to obtain a permission if one of the nationalities is an EU or EEA country.

&gt; The Finnish Ministry of Defence has compiled the key information on this reform witch is available at the moment on its website.",,/r/europe/comments/dovg2o/noneu_citizens_will_need_permission_to_buy_real/f5qnqpa/,quixotic_cynic,1572380058

&gt;Your business shouldn't rely on government assistance to exist, cuz you know, people that get low wages barely pay taxes, and end up depending on poverty combating programs to get by, as well as, using any other public service!

You've completely missed the point, and ignored the final part of my previous post. The fact that we can tax some people to provide for others *does not bear* on the fact that people are only willing to pay so much for a particular product.

&gt;As a manager you might want to innovate - create a new product with a decent profit margin or improve production processes to reduce costs.

Or, you could just not impose an arbitrary price floor. Price floors are one of the few things that economists across the spectrum broadly agree are bad.

&gt;You make the assumption an increase in prices is always followed by a proportional decrease in sales, which is far from true, otherwise no one would ever raise prices. If you're providing a good service people WILL pay for it. But if it's shit...

Except that competition drives profit margins to zero, and causes people to innovate to reduce prices, as you already said. If my coffee is too expensive, and so is everyone elses, it will just incentivize more people to buy coffee machines and make coffee at home, or switch to alternative drinks. You can't just raise with no impact.

&gt;Also I want people to have dignity and basic needs met, while they find a job or come up with a decent business plan.

Amazingly, you'd rather have a person make $0/hr, and be provided with $15/hr in welfare, than have them make $10/hr doing something useful to the economy, and get $5/hr in gov assistance. You think it's more dignified to have it be illegal for you to work? OK then.

Again - go start a business. I bet you'll change your mind very quickly.",,/r/europe/comments/domt6i/portugal_plans_25_increase_of_minimum_wage/f5qpdt8/,SANcapITY,1572380799
900,"&gt; This is such a long discussion. Regarding capital controls, regarding defaulting on specific loans, how feasible the default is.

Yeah it is. That's kinda my point, that the situation is way more complex than people think and everything's a dead end.   


I think my strongest argument is this: Greece borrowed massively and got massive growth as a result. If it was possible to do that and not ""pay"" for it then everybody would be doing it all the time.

904,"&gt; 1.	⁠I do not know where you live, but it seems you're from a country with high % of home ownership. Some countries subsidise home ownership. Germany does not to the same degree i believe.

You are right that I live in a country with high % of home ownership, over 90% actually. You are wrong about homeowners being subsidized, at least in my country (Romania) banks are comparable to fucking loan sharks, with interest rates of more than 5-6% and fixed rate interest rates being basically non-existant, all interest rates being in the form of x% (fixed, offered by the bank) + IRCC (variable depending on economic conditions) which ensures that whatever happens in the economy, the bank is covered and you are as exposed as on a nudist beach with no sun lotion. However despite all this people still buy homes, because they have this mentality, and in the long run it’s almost always better than renting (you need to have real bad luck to end up worse with buying vs renting). 

&gt; 2.	⁠Rent have their own benefits. Flexibility, less of an risk and in some cases aint that much more expensive than buying.

You have flexibility with buying too. You want to move, just rent it out to some sucker who thinks he’s being “flexible”. You can even hire a property manager to not have to worry about it and I promise it will still cover your mortgage. Also renting is much more expensive than buying in almost all cases. If the rent is €1000 and mortgage payment is also €1000 it doesn’t mean it’s the same. When you rent, you just burn the €1000, but when you buy, you are only burning the part that is the interest, the rest is still your money, it’s just that it isn’t liquid anymore. 

&gt; 3.	⁠Commuting is more than just distance, belonging to an area is an very important part of many people culture. France is an excellent example.

That’s just bullshit. Adapting to a new community takes time, but only a few years at worst. However, commuting is just wasted time and money for the entire period. I don’t know anyone who enjoys driving two hours or more on the same fucking road every single day. 

&gt; 4.	⁠People have hobbies... i think playing the lottery is a stupid idea, much like smoking and drinking. It's expensive (atleast in the Nordic countries) and it's basically tossing cash out the window.

I have hobbies too, just not hobbies that would make me poor. 

&gt;5.	⁠''Vacations'', my sister has a saying, live well while you're young and while it will matter for the kids. Money in the bank wont give them the experiences they gain from vacation, hobbies and spending money. My dad told me about a friend of his, who said that her family was poor while his was rich when they were kids. In reality her dad earned more, but he had one goal, paying down his debt as fast as possible.

You can have fun and adventurous vacations for €500, you don’t have to blow €5000. Also, if you really want to visit some exotic place, you can do it like once, you don’t have to do it every single year. 

Also, I grew up being poor as fuck and I can’t say I had a bad childhood. By the time I was 16, I had left my home town maybe 10 times, 5 of which were were school trips. Also, by “leaving my home town” I mean like 300 km at most.",,/r/europe/comments/do5pym/wealth_per_adult_in_europe_2019/f5q4ko1/,crocodilau,1572372448

It's the Turks, Muslims, extension of it is Arabs, a cultural group being alienated, othered by the Europeans. It's widespread racism, phobia.

It isn't about Erdogan or about muslims. It's about the extreme nationalistic Turkish posters here on reddit that whitewash anything Turkey does, including the current invasion of Syria.

939,"&gt; There are a lot of Turks out there who are not like this, however I would argue that mostly they remain silent, because of social pressures and fears of repercussions in Turkey. Let's not forget that the state has targeted social media users several times already. Those who live outside can also become disenfranchised with Turkish internal affairs, depending on where they live and for how long. 

I fully understand that not all Turks are like that but the Turkish public in general seems to be like that, since that's how Turkish state is educating their people. At least from what I see from Reddit, an anti-Erdogan, secular Turk usually becomes an extreme nationalist that starts writing disgusting stuff as soon as some 'hot' topics are brought up.

1000,"&gt; In the heart of central Europe, in the middle of a deep, dark forest, lies a mountain range that changed the world. It’s smaller than the Alps, less dramatic than the Dolomites, and far less romantic than the Carpathians. And yet, its place in modern European history is so vast, so great, that its reputation could dwarf even the Himalayas.
Known as the Sudetes, this borderland between the forests of Germany and the hills of the Czech Republic may not be famous. But the region around it is.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;In 1938, the Sudetenland helped plunge Europe into war.  An ancient meeting place where the Germanic peoples of Central Europe mingled with the
Slavic peoples of the east, the Sudetenland was for centuries a world of cooperation, multiculturalism, and harmony.  Yet in the 20th Century, its residents embraced Nazi nationalism, with horrific consequences for everyone.  Shrouded by mist, stained by violence, and still sprawling across one of Europe’s deepest
fault lines, this is the story of the Sudetenland: the birthplace of WWII.
&gt;
&gt;**Here Come the Germans!**
&gt;
&gt; If you were a European king in the Early Middle Ages – and, if you were, congratulations on surviving this long – there was nothing you wanted more than a kingdom surrounded by deep, impenetrable forest.  This was because deep, impenetrable forests were exactly the sort of thing that kept marauding armies at bay.  So it’s no surprise the early Czech kings of Bohemia set up shop near the Sudetenland, a region of deep forests and rugged mountains that acted as the Early Middle Ages equivalent of an actual border.
&gt;
&gt; But Otakar II had a problem.  He wasn’t a king in the Early Middle Ages.  He was a king in the High Middle Ages.  And, in the High Middle Ages, deep impenetrable forests were very out of vogue. In vogue was having enough subjects to set up skilled industries and pay taxes. So, what’s a king with too few subjects and a great, semi-useless stretch of impenetrable forest to do?
&gt;
&gt;Easy.
&gt;
&gt;Otakar II invited German speakers from all across the Holy Roman Empire to come populate
his Sudetenland.
&gt;
&gt; If you’re expecting to hear the arrival of hordes of beer stein wielding Germans upset the Czech residents of Bohemia, well, you’d be wrong.  Otakar’s new German subjects were skilled craftsmen, tradespeople, rich merchants.  In short, they were a welcome minority.  But events were about to unfold which meant the Germans wouldn’t be a minority for long.
&gt;
&gt; In 1526, the Bohemian crown passed to a guy called Ferdinand I.  A member of the Austrian Habsburgs, Ferdinand was a hands-off sort of ruler.  He allowed the Czech nobles in Bohemia to do their own thing.  But the rest of his family was another matter.  The Habsburgs were generally German-speaking diehard Catholics, while the Czech nobility was generally… not. This was all fine so long as a bunch of riled up Czech protestant nobles didn’t get it into their heads to hurl two Catholics out a Prague castle window into a gigantic pile of manure.
&gt;
&gt;Not much of an ask, was it?
&gt;
&gt; The 1618 Defenestration of Prague didn’t just end with two Catholics in a pile of dung, it ended with the Thirty Years War, a titanic conflict that devastated Central Europe. For the purposes of our story, it also ended with the Czech Protestants rising up against their Catholic overlords, an uprising that went very badly for the Czechs.  On November 8, 1620, the Habsburg armies faced off against the Winter King at the Battle of White Mountain.  While that probably sounds like the sort of epic battle you used to see on Game of Thrones, the reality was it was pretty one-sided.  The Habsburgs crushed the Czechs.  They crushed them like the Incredible Hulk belly flopping onto a stack of fine china.
&gt;
&gt; In the aftermath, the Czech nobility were given the boot.  The Habsburgs tightened their grip on power, and the Germans went from a minority to the
guys calling the shots.  Come the 18th Century, Czech was only spoken by villagers and field workers.  While not everyone who spoke German was ethnically German, this did make the proper Germans in the Sudetenland feel important, powerful, like this was the way the world worked.  It was a feeling only enhanced when the brand new Austrian Empire absorbed Bohemia at the beginning of the 19th Century.  But those comfortable Sudeten Germans would soon be in for a rude awakening.
&gt;
&gt;**Lines in the Sand**
&gt;
&gt; If you’ve ever read a book on 19th Century European history, you’ll know that everything keeps coming back to one year: 1848.  That’s because 1848 is the year Europe exploded.  The actual ins and outs are far too complex for us to go into here.  The super-abridged version is that a revolution in France in February ignited a similar revolution
in Austria, which caused the whole of the continent to pick up pitchforks and overthrow the system.
&gt;
&gt; In Bohemia, the sight of Austria paralyzed by revolts sent Czech nationalism nuclear.  Under a guy called František Palacký, the Czech National Movement swept through Prague, demanding autonomy for Bohemia, and equal rights for the fading Czech language.  Did you notice that?  Palacký was calling for equal rights, not the complete replacement of the widely-spoken German language.  Palacký even invited Sudeten German delegates to his Prague National Congress so they could all hammer out an agreement on what their autonomous Bohemia should look like.  In any other year, it could have been a tale of brotherhood and cooperation.  Unfortunately, 1848 wasn’t “any other year”.
&gt;
&gt; It was the year Europe caught fire.
&gt;
&gt; And Germany was burning too.
&gt;
&gt; To the north of Bohemia, the German-speaking lands had spent the last few decades as a loose confederation of 39 states imaginatively called the German Confederation.
But with kings falling and the waft of gunpowder in Europe’s streets, the Confederation decided 1848 would be the perfect time for uniting into a single nation called Germany.  This Germany would include all lands where German was spoken, a utopia for Germans everywhere.  There was just one teeny, tiny problem.
&gt;
&gt; Bohemia was one of those lands.
&gt;
&gt; When Palacký got the invite to join the German National Congress, he was all like “ha, ha, ha… oh wait, you’re serious.  Um, no.”  But joining the Congress was exactly what the Sudeten Germans wanted.  So they sent delegates on Bohemia’s behalf.  You could almost call this the First Sudeten Crisis.  In Prague, the Czechs were meeting to establish a new Bohemia with Slavic peoples at the heart of it.  In Frankfurt, the Sudeten Germans were meeting to try and drag Bohemia into a country called Germany.  The only reason these competing revolutions didn’t erupt into civil war was that Prince Windischgratz got there first.  Prince Windischgratz was Bohemian by birth and German by origin.  But by temperament he was a fanatically loyal Habsburg army officer.  And the Habsburgs weren’t about to let Bohemia fall to the Czechs or the Germans.  In June, 1848, Windischgratz surrounded Prague and bombed the city into submission. Under the constant shelling, the Czechs were forced to discard their dreams of a Slavic Bohemia.  Not long after, the Sudeten Germans were forced to discard their hopes, too.
&gt;
&gt; Although the 1848 revolutions ended with Bohemia still under the Austrians, things had changed.  No longer could anyone pretend Czechs and Germans were living happily together.  The competing Congresses had drawn ethnic lines in the sand, separating neighbors.  As the 19th Century rumbled on and the Czech language experienced a revival, separate schools and universities started to appear.  People started to see each other as separate.  Almost as rivals.  So long as the Austrian-Empire – now reorganized into the Austro-Hungarian Empire – remained standing, there would always be another Windischgratz to bomb everyone into line.  But the winds of change were blowing across Europe.  And soon the Empire would come crashing down.

pulsions were halted in 1947, that number had been reduced to a mere 170,000.
&gt;
&gt; The final death toll of the expulsion of the Sudeten Germans was 6,000 murdered, 6,000 suicides, and between 25,000 and 30,000 killed by exhaustion, disease, or exposure.  Over 3 million people had been turned into refugees, dumped in war-shattered Germany.  The few Sudeten Germans who did remain were those who could prove they’d fought against the Nazis, or those who had the good fortune to be married to Czechs.  It wasn’t the worst atrocity in Central European history.  When neighboring Poland expelled their Germans, it’s thought 430,000 died.  Even this number pales in comparison to Nazi atrocities.  Still, the expulsion of the Germans from Czechoslovakia had consequences.  The most immediate was the death of the Sudetenland.  From a unique microculture with a tradition stretching back centuries, the Sudetenland became just another Czech region in Bohemia.  Sure, the region itself remained, complete with its mountains and deep, impenetrable forests.  But the thing that had made it a region worth knowing about; the glue that had held its unique culture together had gone.
&gt;
&gt; Today, there are barely 40,000 descendants of the Sudeten Germans living in the Czech Republic.  While the ghosts of the past still haunt towns like Cheb or Zatec in the form of Germanic architecture, most traces of the millions of Germans who once lived out their lives here are long gone.  All their hopes and fears, all their families and businesses, all are nothing but dust.  Footnotes, if they’re lucky, on some small plaque that no-one ever reads.
&gt;
&gt; Yet, for better or worse, the Sudetenland’s place in history is assured.  It was here that the first rumblings were felt of a war that would shatter the world.  Here that decisions were taken that would set Hitler on a path of conquest.  It’s by no means a happy history.  It’s not something you learn about to comfort yourself before falling asleep at night.  But the Sudetenland’s past is a vital history, one that deserves to be remembered.  In its own small way, that vitality ensures those who once lived here – whether they were Czech, German, or Jewish – will never be forgotten.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/doq6od/the_sudetenland_the_trigger_for_ww2/f5pq1qa/,duisThias,1572365216

That Europeans think they hold all the cards whilst in reality we hold absolutely none.

&gt;You are saying that everyone should just keep obeying Erdogan or else things will escalate?

Europe offered Turkey financial aid in return for Turkey closing it's border, and keeping Syrians in. Financial aid we have barely paid and amounts to peanuts in comparison to the cost. Then we paint Erdogan as some frothing at the mouth dictator when he becomes sick of our double-game. 

&gt;Turkey has invaded Syria and is persecuting and replacing the local Kurdish population.

Yeah, I respectfully disagree.

Not quite as bad as when we (often clandestinely) propped up an internationally recognised terrorist group on their Syrian border.

&gt;All that while they stockpile weapons like pre ww2 germany and have an all controlling dictator.

&gt; **Left Out in the Cold**
&gt;
&gt; There’s a classic question kids like to ask: how many people could you kill with a single bullet?  The answer: not as many as Gavrilo Princip.
&gt;
&gt; On 28 June, 1914, Princip was stood on a street corner in Sarajevo, Bosnia, waiting to meet royalty.  It was now decades since the upheavals of 1848, and much had changed.
750 kilometers away, in Bohemia, the revival of the Czech language had become a frenzy.  As villagers poured into the cities, German and Germans were once again relegated to minorities.  But Princip wasn’t thinking about that.  He was thinking about how the Habsburgs had just annexed Bosnia into the Austro-Hungarian Empire.  How this was an act of piracy that required vengeance.  And Princip was the man to deliver it.
&gt;
&gt; That hot day, the heir to the Austrian throne, Franz Ferdinand, was in Sarajevo on a visit.  As his motorcade drove past Princip, the young man raised his pistol…
…and fired the shot that would kill millions.  The assassination of Franz Ferdinand was the shove that toppled the precarious house of cards called Europe.  The collapse of those cards is better known as World War One, and it killed 20 million.  It also killed the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
&gt;
&gt; By 1918, the forces of nationalism unleashed by 1848 hadn’t gone away.  When it became clear the Empire was losing WWI, all its many minorities made a break for freedom.
The first split happened right back in Bohemia.  On October 28, 1918, the Czechs in Prague unilaterally declared independence from Austria.  Within 24 hours, other parts of the disintegrating empire were breaking off.  Among them were the Slovaks, who wound up joining the Czechs in something called Czechoslovakia.  But there were others trying to shape a different future.  On October 30, a group of German speakers in Austria declared the creation of another  new nation: German-Austria.  Comprising all of the German-speaking regions of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, it included  Austria proper, but also the Sudetenland.
&gt;
&gt; NOTE FOR EDITORS: Useful map if needed: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_German-Austria#/media/File:GermanAustriaMap.png
&gt;
&gt; At that time, the Sudetenland was home to over 3 million Germans.  In some regions, over 90% of locals were German.  But across the Sudetenland as a whole, that figure fell to only a little over 25%.  The rest were a mix of Czechs, Slovaks, Poles, and Jews.  So when German-Austria tried to claim the Sudetenland, the Czech army said “Nu-uh”.
The Czech occupation of the Sudetenland caused uproar among Bohemia’s Germans.  They demanded the right to self-determination, to be absorbed into German-Austria or Germany
itself.  When German-Austria held its first elections on March 1, 1919, the Sudeten Germans protested to be allowed to take part.  The Czech authorities responded with bullets.  Finally, in September, 1919, the Allies settled the issue with the Treaty of Saint-Germain.  The treaty annulled all Austrian claims to the Sudetenland.  Just like that, the region became part of Czechoslovakia.
&gt;
&gt; For those who lived there, it was a painful blow.  From a favored minority in a Germanic empire, the Sudeten Germans suddenly went to outsiders in a land of Czechs and Slovaks.  That outsider status was confirmed when an official Czechoslovak assembly was called in February, 1920 to write the new constitution.  Only Czechs and Slovaks were invited.  Locked out in the cold, the Sudeten Germans could only shiver and rage at this injustice.  In this new Czechoslovakia, Slovaks made up 16% of the population, Czechs 50%.  The Germans made up 22.3%.  They were the second largest grouping!  And yet here they were, unable to even help craft the constitution.  It was deeply unfair.  It was also something the Czechoslovaks would soon come to regret.
&gt;
&gt;**Unfinished Business**
&gt;
&gt; The early history of the First Czechoslovak Republic is one of compromises and promises unkept.  The president, Tomáš Masaryk, initially envisaged a Swiss style federal system that would allow each ethnic group a degree of autonomy.  Instead, the Republic wound up a highly centralized state governed from Prague.  For the Germans, this was yet another slap in the face.  Across the Sudetenland, it became policy to treat the government in Prague as illegitimate.  Yet, we’d be lying if we said Czechoslovakia’s Germans were treated badly.  Yes, they’d been barred from drawing up the constitution.  But the constitution that emerged had been respectful of German rights.  Nor was every German living in Czechoslovakia jumping at the bit to secede.  In cities like Brno, Germans, Czechs, and Jews all lived side-by-side as peacefully as they had for centuries.
&gt;
&gt; By 1925, there were even signs that wider cooperation might be possible.  That year, the Pact of Locarno formalized relations between Germany and Czechoslovakia.  In the Sudetenland, political leaders began softening their separatist stances.  When the November election returned a divided parliament, two German parties even officially joined the Czechoslovak government.  In another universe, this could have been the start of something.  A journey that would end with the Sudeten Germans fully integrating into Czechoslovakia.  But, sadly, we don’t live in another universe.  And, in this universe, the 1920s ended with a catastrophe that destroyed all hopes of integration.
&gt;
&gt; The Wall Street Crash was the miserable herald of a miserable and hungry decade.  In Czechoslovakia, that misery and hunger was concentrated mostly in the Sudetenland’s
industrial cities.  While the government in Prague initiated a program of unemployment relief, it didn’t do nearly enough for the stricken German towns.  The unfortunate result was that the Germans felt the Czechoslovak government was helping Czechs and Slovaks at the expense of the drowning Sudetenland.  It was a feeling that gave birth to resentment, that in turn gave birth to a monster. That monster’s name was Konrad Henlein.  A former gymnastics coach, Henlein was the Sudetenland’s #1 fanboy of Adolf Hitler.
&gt;
&gt; In 1933, Henlein decided to bring the Sudetenland its own fascist party, one that could capitalize on all this misery and resentment.  That May, the Sudeten German Homeland movement was born.  A bunch of SS wannabees, the Homeland movement was brash.  Anti-Semitic.  Openly fascist.  And very violent.  As Henlein’s power grew over the Sudetenland’s disaffected Germans, so to did violence against moderates.
&gt;
&gt; Before long, refusing to express support for Henlein in the Sudetenland was the quickest route you could take to having your head caved in by a bunch of Aryan nutjobs.  By the time Henlein’s now-renamed Sudeten German Party contested the 1935 elections, he held the region in an iron grip.  The returns were a wake-up call to Prague.  Henlein pulled down two thirds of the German vote, around 1.2 million people.  No other party in the whole of Czechoslovakia did so well.  It was only thanks to the way seats were distributed that Henlein didn’t win outright, instead netting 44 seats to the Agrarian party’s 45.  For Henlein, it was all the mandate he needed.  In the Sudetenland, the Party took over the levers of power, effectively killing democracy.  While Czechoslovakia itself was still democratic, it now carried a fascist tumor that poisoned its politics, made it sick.
&gt;
&gt; In three short years, that tumor would kill Czechoslovakia entirely.  The Sudeten Crisis On November 5, 1937, Adolf Hitler informed his generals of his plan to annex the Sudetenland.  Just two weeks later, Konrad Henlein traveled to Germany and met with Hitler in private. If the *Fuhrer* wanted to conquer the Sudetenland, then Henlein would help him do it. It was a momentous meeting, but it was also inevitable. Since 1936, the German intelligence agency, the *Abwehr*, had been meddling in the Sudetenland.  Nazi propaganda was being smuggled into the region.  Meanwhile, Henlein’s goons had snuffed out the last vestiges of opposition.  The Czechoslovaks could see the conflagration coming.  Prague was in firefighting mode, offering concessions to the Sudetenland that no other regions were allowed.
&gt;
&gt; But it was too little, too late.  In March, 1938, Nazi tanks rolled into Austria, annexing it into Germany proper.  For Henlein, it was the propaganda coup he needed.  Seeing the peaceful Anschluss bring the Austrians into a Germany that was economically booming and feared on the world stage sent the Sudetenland into a frenzy.  Henlein began making Hitler-esque speeches, demanding full autonomy within Czechoslovakia.  When local elections were held a month later, his fascist party pulled down 90% of the German
vote.  Standing on the sidelines, Britain and France watched the crisis unfolding with visible discomfort.  Both countries liked to style themselves the adults of Europe, the ones who were there to stop bullyboys like Germany from beating on the smaller nations.  But now the moment to act had come, they were simply too scared.  Their hesitation only made the Sudeten Crisis worse.

Also, your conspiracy theory ignores the fact that banks actually had to accept a 50% loss on that debt, Greece received a 50% haircut of its debt held by private banks.

1068,"The Dutch contribution to the long-term budget of the European Union threatens to rise sharply in the coming years, reports the Ministry of Finance after previous reports from Het Financieele Dagblad (FD). If the European Commission gets its way, the annual gross contribution to the EU budget will increase by 62.5 percent over the next seven years to around 13 billion euros.

The EU works with a multi-year budget. The current budget will expire next year, so there is a lot of negotiation about the size and implementation of the new budget for the period from 2021 to 2027.

The European Commission wants the budget to be increased to 1.11 percent of the European gross domestic product (GDP). The Netherlands and Germany indicated earlier this month that they are sticking to a maximum of 1 percent of European GDP, and even now the government has indicated that the increase of 62.5 percent is ""unacceptable"".

EU countries must unanimously agree with this new multi-year budget. It is therefore far from saying that the European Commission will get its way.

'EU remittance from Germany more than doubles'
Not only the Netherlands sees the payment rise. Germany will also pay considerably more. According to Financial Times (FT), the German contribution to the European multi-year budget will even double.

1136,"The point i made was not where the debt came from, but why harsh cuts were necessary now.

That so much was spent on the military was bad, but it is what it is. And that budget had been reduced to normal levels already. And it is ok to overspend so much in a sector for a time, but only while the debt-to-gdp levels are way below 100%.

But during the last decade before the crisis (2000-2010) the pensions went so through the roof that they were a problem that had to be tackled. And unlike the military, where you can cut back rather quickly, a mistake with pensions will have 2-3 decades of repercussions that you won't instantly notice. And worse, any cut to pension will be felt, harshly.

Here's a great publication with many different charts just to show how much of a problem pensions were and still are:  [http://www.lse.ac.uk/Hellenic-Observatory/Assets/Documents/Publications/Books/2015-17/greece-expenditure-on-social-protection-and-pensions.pdf](http://www.lse.ac.uk/Hellenic-Observatory/Assets/Documents/Publications/Books/2015-17/greece-expenditure-on-social-protection-and-pensions.pdf) 

One little quote about the part where i believe the EU could have acted way better:

&gt; The aforementioned decline would have been even larger if it wasn’t undermined by extensive grandfathering of previous early retirement options, which led to a massive wave of early retirement to take advantage of the previous more generous rules (IMF, January 2017) 

This was the one area where i really do fault Germany etc. We should have funded social security/welfare options so that older people didn't have to enter into early retirement just so that they get at least some money. Such a massive wasted opportunity, especially because it directly made the problem of overarching pension spending even worse.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/dokdt9/european_stability_mechanism_approves_athens/f5pfw4p/,Alcobob,1572358359

At the same time, the harsh winter (lake IJssel froze) and a German ban on transport licenses as a reprisal statuary the railway strikes made any transport at all incredibly tough. This meant that the situation had already grown precarious in the winter of '44. By early '45 the Allies had effectively taken the rest of the country, leaving the west cut off.  Then the Germans started flooding large amounts of farm land as a scorched earth tactic, depriving the western provinces of the capability of producing enough food themselves.

When I was young there was quite an argumnet as to whether newspapers should even publish opinion polls, because they were thought to be unscientific and probably too easy to skew. Now newspapers commission expensive opinion polls usually in concert with a television or broadcasting organisation. Commission their own polls and then print their own findings as news on the front page when they've got nothing else to do. This is a parody of democracy. It's not even populism really. It's pseudo-science for one thing and it's anti-democratic for another. 

Pollster originally meant huckster. Basically somebody making a living out of something that's vaguely fraudulent. It used to be that newspapers would wonder if they should print opinion poll results at all, let along commission them. Now they commission them and wonder if they should use them for their own background information or whether they should themselves print them.

1275,"&gt; People thinking that a worker, who will do the same job for less, making them jobless, without money and not being able to survive are called paranoid?

The circumstances under what this happens are totally different to what actually happens.  
Those pesky foreigners coming to your country and taking away your jobs don't exist. That's the irrational fear.  
What does happen is that the owners of a company closes the factory and moves production to a cheaper country altogether. But that's not the fault of the foreigners. 

&gt; If the skillset they have is minimal and someone can replace them, then the person has a right to feel scared about their position, no matter if they are replaced by a local or a foreigner.

Look at the UK. Because of the looming Brexit there is a shortage of workers from the EU that pick the fruit. The harvest is rotting in the orchards. Since those EU workers supposedly take away the jobs from the UK workers. You'd expect that now there are open jobs for this work that lots of British unemployed workers rejoice and go work in the fields. Nope. Looks like the poor unskilled worker whose job was replaced by foreigners doesn't exist.

As of right now 3,9%. That's pretty top in terms of Europe.

Romania has a labour participation rate, currently, of 53,4%. Down from 54% last year. That's just two points of from Poland and 4 points above Croatia. We're definitely not great but not bad either. Croatia had a disastrous youth unemployment rate at one point compared to our very good one (not sure if that's still the case) + lower labour participation rate.

Norway is a tiny oil state they have very special conditions that lead to  high income but there are regions inside the US with population of 10 mil+ that are more prosperous that Norway without natural resources being a source of that wealth.California has the same gdp/c while it has population of 40 million people NY has 20 million people with gdp of 85k.

Norway Sweden and Denmark contain just 20 million people and are average gdp/c in that group is around 57k that is under US average sitting at 62 and that is the richest region of the EU.

US is just simply more prosperous than the EU similarity to how Denmark is to Spain or Spain to Estonia.Poverty rate in the US is similar to Western Europe and the poverty threshold is much higher in the US because it is based on % of median income in each nation.

This leaves Putin with the question of how and whether at all the increasingly costly intervention in Syria answers Russia’s own national interests

What we need is to be able to stop such a trend and developments by force. Reality is, we allready have countries like China that are an exact replica of nazi germany in the years before the war. Over 3 Million people in concetration camps, massive state police, high investments in military, no respect for human rights, and more aggresive on the world stage, year to year.
But Europe has no means to stop war. The only thing they can do is to make a press release. They can't even stop Erdogan from killing our allies in the fight against ISIS. Europe can not rely on itselfe. It always relies on the UN (that has no power what so ever) and the US which demand more and more from Europe for ensuring it's security.

1404,"&gt; Every country has a list of controlled substances. It's not a cultural thing that has developed in some countries, because of the beliefs of random people. Scientific committees decide which substances will be in those lists.


This isn't really true. A lot of these were controlled due to purely political motivations with deeply religious overtones. See marijuana and the textile industry with the added layers of racim, or prohibition and the temperance movement. Also, that benzodiazapene argument is a bit of a strawman, but I'll address it. As a physician, I can tell you that benzodiazapenes are abused to no end despite their controlled status, and it is extremely difficult to ween someone off long term benzo use even knowing that benzos don't have any indication of use over 3 months. If you try, most patients will go seek out another provider to get their prescription, and they usually get it because you can't stop them abruptly. Benzo use is a perfect example of a failed drug policy. Most people are completely unaware of their dangers thinking a medication a doctor prescribes is inherently safe when it totally is not, and education has totally failed. 
I think people have autonomy to decide what they do with their bodies and their lives, and that most people are sensible and listen to reason. We don't have any right to impose our will on people even if we (think we) know best. It's a tennant of modern medicine. I think drug policy is best employed by education and not banning substances which mostly only serves to delay addiction help.

Activision apparently thought it was a good idea to run a promotional campaign over here and enlist a number of local streamers, 12 or so, I believe. Out of these 12, Maddyson (an old guard local streamer) dropped the game the day before his first scheduled stream, trashing the campaign on the social media and swearing he hadn't seen single player before signing his contract. At least one other contracted streamer dropped the game on air. As far as I know, the entire promotion is now cancelled.

It's not like Activision didn't know this was going to happen, either. They even tried to sidestep the problems by painting white helmets green in the localization and renaming Russian army to ""general &lt;name&gt;'s people"", if gaming news is to be believed.

1448,"&gt;So the Party was banned, sunk to record low support, then got unbanned and rose again?

that's an extremely simplistic way of looking at it. the ""record low support"" was mainly because the party was a complete shambles during Hitler's time in prison and hadn't really reorganized until 1928

&gt;Hitler was literally appointed Chancellor, he didn’t even win any election.

sure, but the Nazis won a plurality in multiple elections, so to just write it off as a decision made by hindenburg on a whim is a bit ahistoric

&gt;His rise to power was 100% due to the system and status quo that enabled him, the conservatives, centrists and centre-leftists who preferred a Fascist over a potential Communist government.

this is completely false. his ""rise to power"" was due to the immense support given to the party by a broad section of the german populace, without that, hitler is a footnote. 

his ascension to power, i.e. his appointment to chancellor, had nothing to do with the ""centre-left"". in fact, the SPD were at all times anti-NSDAP, whereas the communists were willing to work with the nazis were their interests aligned (there were several strikes in 1930, 1931, and even 1932 were the KPD and NSDAP were working together)",,/r/europe/comments/dof6t7/germany_should_ban_neonazi_parties_says_world/f5owzg3/,ihadcorrectopinions,1572337021

The Kremlin grew upset regarding how the United States and Turkey seemed to take on exclusive management of the new escalation of the Syrian crisis even as the widely reported-on six-hour bargaining session in Sochi cemented Russia’s role as a major owner of this violent debacle (Kommersant, October 23). Now, Russian experts and officials have begun to more soberly assess the costs and risks of the new commitment, and the surge of joy over yet again having demonstrated Russia’s “Great Power” status is turning into deepening worry. Putin seemingly has always wanted to achieve victory in Syria on the cheap, and he repeatedly announced intentions to withdraw the bulk of Russian forces engaged in the protracted intervention (see EDM, March 17, 21, 2016 and November 27, 2017).

We don't tell if two languages are related based on whether their words sound similar; we see if they have regular patterns of change, then compare and reconstruct from there.

[This](https://www.quora.com/What-two-words-are-related-but-sound-nothing-alike/answer/Oscar-Tay-1) is another good example: ""wheel"", ""cycle"", and ""chakra"" sound nothing alike, but we know from looking at other words that there's a regular pattern that a ""kw"" sound in Proto-Indo-European turns into a ""ku"" sound in Greek (spelled ""cy"" here), a ""wh"" in English, and a ""ch"" in Sanskrit, so we can tell that they're related.

The Greeks say the same.

My grandfather faught in Albania. He lead a small squad of about 20 guys with two heavy water-cooled machine guns (leftovers from WWI). At some point they captured a single Italian soldier. They had nothing to do with him, so they kept him as an assistant (carrying stuff). I don't think he was even tied up as there was no where for him to go. 

Near the end of the war they got reinforced and the fresh Greeks wanted to kill the prisoner. The new commander was a blood thirsty bastard and wanted to give him a field trial and hang him for the crimes of Mussolini. But my grandfather insisted the guy was ""his Italian"" who my grandfather captured fair and square. He told the new commander to go to the front and find his own Italian if he wants to kill one so badly. 

The Italian guy survived actually looked my grandfather up in the 1960s. I believe they were pen pals for years after that. I'm ashamed to have forgotten his name.",Earth,/r/europe/comments/do4gzb/on_this_day_in_1940_italian_troops_invaded/f5oh218/,Ut_Prosim,1572317943

1775,"&gt; An organic Greek olive oil won first place recently in the World Ranking of EVOO (or Extra-Virgin Olive Oils), garnering this accolade for the second consecutive year.
&gt; 
&gt; The extra virgin olive oil “Gemstone Blend Evoo” from Sakellaropoulos’ organic olive groves  in Lakonia was declared the very best olive oil in the entire world in the category “Best Condiment Olive Oil.”
&gt; 
&gt; A total of 12,092 samples of olive oils from 34 countries and olive oil producers took part in the competition.
&gt; 
&gt; “The Gemstone Blend Evoo was produced for the first time in 2019 after many years of experimentation, in order to reach the very high level of taste and quality” stated Nikos Sakellaropoulos, the co-owner of the organic olive groves.
&gt; 
&gt; Sakellaropoulosm, who is also a chemist, spoke about his company’s experience at the competition with the Athens-Macedonian News Agency.
&gt; 
&gt; The olive oil rankings are issued every year by the World Association of Writers and Journalists of Wines and Spirits, a group which judges all the olive oils which have received distinction in international blind tasting competitions for their quality and their taste.
&gt; 
&gt; It is noted that this is the first time that Greek olive oil, and a Greek company that produces it, has won in this specific category for two consecutive years.

1780,"&gt; The European Stability Mechanism (ESM) on Monday approved an early partial repayment of Greece’s outstanding loans to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
&gt; 
&gt; At the same time it will waive Greece’s obligation to simultaneously repay the same proportion of outstanding loans from the ESM and European Financial Stability Facility.
&gt; 
&gt; Greece had proposed the early repayment of the more expensive portion of its IMF loans, amounting to 2.7 billion euros, but the equivalent proportion of its ESM/EFSF loans, which without the waiver would then immediately become due, amounted to 52.2 billion euros.
&gt; 
&gt; ”Greece’s early partial repayment to the IMF will be beneficial for both Greece and the ESM. It will generate savings as Greece can now finance itself on the market at a lower cost compared to the cost of servicing the tranche to be repaid to the IMF,” the ESM noted in a statement on Monday.
&gt; 
&gt; Commenting on the decision, Greek Finance Minister Christos Staikouras stated that Greece’s early partial repayment of its outstanding IMF loans will increase the nation’s financial credibility and secure immediate gains for the public sector.
&gt; 
&gt; “This move, which was a target proclaimed by the Prime Minister and the Finance Ministry, is of exceptional importance for the country and the Greek economy. The Finance Ministry continues to work, methodically and in a well-established manner, for the step-by-step return of the country’s economy to full normality,” Staikouras added.",Greece,/r/europe/comments/dokdt9/european_stability_mechanism_approves_athens/f5okb5p/,ThallassaGreece,1572320612

1821,"I’m sorry, but the fact that your median wealth is much lower than most developed countries is nobody’s fault but your own. Almost all the Germans I’ve met completely suck at managing their personal finances and worse still they don’t even seem to care:

- The vast majority of Germans rent their homes instead of buying them, which is the most idiotic thing possible. The cost of renting or buying a home is relatively similar, but the difference it has on your wealth is huge. When you buy a home, with every mortagage payment your net worth increases, while when you pay rent you are just burning money. 

- even though they rent, which is already bad enough, many Germans commute 150+ km every day by car to work. This is absolutely moronic, if you are renting your home because this supposedly gives you mobility, the why the fuck wouldn’t you try to find something closer to your workplace. And I’ve heard many Germans say, “well the rent is cheaper there”, well guess what, if you are saving €200 in rent but blowing €400 more on your car because you have to commute over long distances you are an idiot!

- They treat cars like fucking smartphones. So you guys buy a brand new car, like €40.000, drive it for 3-4 years, then give that perfectly good car back to the dealer in exchange for a shit discount on the newer model, even though you could either drive that car for at least 5-7 years more with no major problems or simply not sell it to a private buyer and get a lot more money than what the dealer would offer you, like a few thousand Euros more. 

- They blow waaay too much money on vacations.

1854,"&gt; Okay, so I'm still not sure whether it's acceptable or not to use self-reported data: on one hand you keep rejecting them, on the other you keep using them when it suits you.
&gt; 
&gt; If you're giving them some kind of credibility, then the census data from 2015 is just as valid as the 1980 data, and it shows at best a tie, and potentially a slight predominance of German if the ""American"" group isn't infered to only be ""English"", which is the most probable and realistic hypothese in my opinion.
&gt; 
&gt; If you're not giving them some kind of credibility, then again, it's on you to provide evidences that the data are wrong.

This argument is so ridiculously fallacious that I don't know where to begin. For someone who claims to be all about evidence you sure lack a background in research methods. For example:

&gt;If you're giving them some kind of credibility, then the census data from 2015 is just as valid as the 1980 data

Can you see this statement is ridiculous? Do you think it literally impossible for each data set to have differing levels of validity? Just on the basis of some categorical similarity? Do you realise why that is terrible reasoning?

1. Each individual data set has some level of validity in terms of indicating dominant ancestry. 

2. We can't be exactly sure how much.

3. The change between the 1980 and 2000 data is entirely impossible if we assume that self-reported data is a strong indicator of dominant ancestry. (we could calculate exactly how improbable the change was with enough effort)

4. The question we are concerned with is the ancestry and not the census data.

5. Point 3 is strong grounds to believe that self-reported heritage is a poor indicator of actual ancestry. 

6. Point 5 does not entail that the any of the data sets have no validity whatsoever. 

7. Given the causality of the change between 1980 - 2000 is clear, the addition of ""American"" as a possible choice of answer. An answer that is clearly no indicator of ancestry whatsoever (especially as Indigenous American is available as a choice), it is strong grounds to suggest that the data set prior to this change is a better indicator of dominant ancestry as it was before before this null response was added.

8. It is reasonably likely that the 1980 data is better indicator of ancestry than the 2000 data.

9. We still don't know how valid any of the data sets are in terms of reflecting ancestry. 2000 is obviously worse than 1980 (how you can contest this boggles the mind), but 1980 could also be so inaccurate as to be useless.
 
Now let me speak plainly. It is generally accepted that British is the largest ancestry group of Caucasians in the USA. The census data is a poor indicator of ancestry. If you want to dig out a real genealogical study that supports the widely held belief that British is the largest group. Go ahead. I've made my points. 

Now stop acting as if this topic has never been researched. Go do your own research and don't attack me with some absurd argument based on the notion that the census data is the only evidence because it's the only thing mentioned in this thread as if Reddit were the entire universe and I must source every claim I make.

Almost all the claims for German being the most prevalent dominant ancestry are based on the 2000 (and maybe 1990) census. We can agree that's poor evidence I hope (of dominant ancestry, not of what people identify with which is a separate question). Just because it's the only evidence we've discussed here, doesn't make my argument irrational and self-serving. My only arguments have been that the change between 1980 and 2000 is a strong argument that the data is a poor indicator and a weak argument that British was really the prevalent ancestry prior to the addition of a null response (weak because we know self-reported heritage is a poor indicator of dominant ancestry). The rest I leave up to the general consensus that UK ancestry is prevalent (a matter itself confused by Irish independence). Have fun researching the topic yourself and stop this childish, pointless, unproductive Reddit debating.

Most parts of Poland, Toruń among them, stayed normal. Some parts really went insane, with the prices. The effects are comical. The Polish Post Office recently said it will diversify salaries.

1959,"&gt;Could you see any of the last year happening the way it did? 

Yes to be honest, was clear enough once May's deal failed that we were not going to get a deal, so then it was a matter of getting something or anything done, the politicians don't want a second vote as they think they'll lose their seats (and every time they have tried such a resolution, it failed). Enough of the British public don't support it (based on current polling) and it won't resolve anything, particularly if remain then wins. Farage said back in 2016 a 52/48 for remain wouldn't be accepted by leave, can you imagine this going on for the next 5 years if there was a second vote and remain won 52/48? Do we then need a third?

&gt;In terms of the practical realities, we don't know how this week will go, but if Boris does bring another vote on his deal, the Lib Dems will undoubtedly attach a people's vote amendment. I think it could very well win the backing of enough Labour MPs to pass.

Boris' deal has already passed, just not on the timetable he initially proposed. Doing it for 3 months of debate and it'll probably get through.

BXP will depend on what the Tories do - in Labour seats in the leave voting areas, if Tories didn't run, a marginal seat could swing enough particularly if Corbyn isn't committing to anything.

SNP lost lots of seats in 2017, there are plenty of people in Scotland awake to the failure of a government they have been and they're still banging on about independence rather than trying to tun the country.

Labour could lose enough votes in marginals to lose control to the Tories if the Tories are running on a leave platform and no-one knows what Corbyn stands for.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/do6hmp/eu_agrees_to_brexit_extension_to_31_january/f5nk8o1/,Tuarangi,1572301040

2003,"I carry the same thoughts as you but arrive at the opposite conclusion. I feel that there has been misinformation, that the outcome of a brexit would be no where near as dire as we are being led to believe; i will acknowledge that it wouldn’t be rosey either for quite sometime afterward. It can be said that is it always darkest before the light as the new normal sets in. I certainly understand the the argument of the difficulty of readmission but i am unconvinced. brexit has certainly been made difficult as well, so what, carry on. Readmission is difficult, so what, carry on.

I absolutely agree that parliament is holding the nation hostage and needs to get on with it, one way or the other. I disagree with a second referendum as its something that school children do when they don’t get the outcome they like. It sets horrible precedent, one of the likes of the Soviets or Maoist China, but with the flavor of a tyrannical majority similar to Nazi Germany. 

Which leads me to an interesting thing you stated, “a small majority” which makes little sense. The referendum was a true binary, stay or go. Im not certain how a majority could be the smaller of two. One argument is that the voting bloc has changed, so what? Parliament abdicated that power, something they shouldn’t have done, but they did and need to in good faith execute the will of a democratic vote. The die has been cast, the nation has crosses the Rubicon.

Instead Hitler wasted time, resources, pilots, planes, landing craft, etc. on beating Britain in the air and then hoping to invade Britain.

After the board setup, the French players would explain the single, double, sometimes triple meanings of the words and I'd write them down into a notebook.

The ""renting is more expensive than buying"" argument also completely ignores the opportunity costs of tying a lot of capital and a large chunk of your free cash flow over the next decades up in one investment. A standard 60/40 portfolio of stocks and bonds will most likely outperform (inflation-adjusted) real estate over the long run. It also has the benefit of being much more liquid and better diversified. 

So, if you invest the money that would otherwise go towards buying a house, you will probably be better off in the end. The problem in Germany is though that few people do that, because the level of financial literacy is extremely low.

* Tories will try to call an election today under FTPA, which will fail because Labour won't get its 'no deal never' idea written into law (remember when they said they'll accept an election only when no deal will be averted on October 31st?)
* SNP and LibDems will try to call an election tomorrow under one-line bill, which will fail because Tories will claim that because the House has voted against an election and Brexit deal went through second reading, then it means the deal has to be passed through
* Tories will try to pass a Brexit deal, which will fail because there's no actual majority for it and it will still be 20 days before Brexit deadline, so there's still time to ask for an extension
* the French will block another extension because the British are f*cking around, which god knows if it will succeed or fail

And that is not considering a situation where Number 10 decides not to accept an extension, because ""it's the Parliament who asked for extension, so we won't accept it"", which then means either Vote of No Confidence or High Court - all within a single day, because I don't think they'll show their cards until the last moment.",Warsaw,/r/europe/comments/do6hmp/eu_agrees_to_brexit_extension_to_31_january/f5l09bu/,uelkamewrybady,1572272277

Also why are you so offended by an observation? Turkish does share words with Farsi which Kurdish is close to linguistically speaking, but as history shows cultures that share closer geographic ties tend to borrow lingo. Kurdish culture is physically closer to Turkish culture that formed in Anatolia, that has an effect on both people. Look at Turkish pop songs that are just translations of old Kurdish folk music, it’s really visible in modern Turkish wedding music even. Why don’t we see the same impact of Persian culture on Turkish culture the way we see with Kurdish culture has impacted it? It’s literally as simple as geography. 

Lastly the reason I brought this up is because modern Turkish culture is heavily influenced by its surroundings and the people that migrated to the region after the fall of the Ottoman Empire. That’s a fact. I bring up “modernization” of Turkey bc it literally creates what we have as “Turkishness”. I know you don’t like being told about “your culture” and “your language” but that’s a reality. The ottomans spoke a language that is different from the Turkish that you and I speak, and this change happened in less than 50 years after the fall.

2520,"Don't you know that debt at the level of national monetary policy is exactly the same as a debt at the level of personal finance, and moreover, nobody can actively manage even a small amount debt at the level of personal finance anyway because humans are inherently irresponsible and incapable of managing money: every single person who ever got a credit card massively overspending and ending up bankrupt and destitute?

Debt is evil and bad because contravenes the natural of the universe that states you are only entitled to what you earned, and any deviation from the true path leads to decadence and moral decay in society, okay?

For example, despite the fact that Germany has been an economic powerhouse for the last decade, and the fact that most of the profits have done nothing but go into the pockets of big German corporations, who have prudently saved it rather than invest in retaining or expanding their competitive edge, and despite the fact that the last few decades have seen the largest shift of German wealth from households to corporations, it totally wouldn't moral or right for Germany to avoid the coming recession with a policy of economic stimulus that might put greater wealth into the hands of ordinary German people such that demand rises and recession is averted. 

The coming German recession must be tackled in the proper manner, by the collective tightening the belts of society with the inevitable job losses and decreases in avg. household spending that will entail. It is only right and proper given that Germany clearly hasn't earned anything better than poverty and the coming recession is totally the fault of the German people and nothing to do with China's industrial slowdown. 

Moreover, it's not like fiscal conservatism is a right wing policy that has been supported by every bourgeois ruling class throughout history on the basis that they want their large amounts of savings to retain their wealth without having to reinvest them back into the society in which they participate. Remember, right wing politics do no exist in Germany, and the current massive popular support for austerity is all about protecting Oma's pension and not at all good for the extremely wealthy. 

It's not as if a reasonable amount of borrowing at the level of the nation state is sign of confidence in future economic performance. And even if it were, it would be totally wrong to do so because the future is black with no possibility of anything but social and economic decline. Just look at climate change, ecological breakdown, dwindling oil reserves etc. It's not like the only way to mitigate these problems to any extent would be to confidently invest in tackling them now rather than waiting until it's too late because we haven't yet earned those things. 

So remember, debt is bad and shameful! The best policy is always balancing the books. Consolidation of wealth is exactly what we need in these times of radical social and technological change.

2525,"I was probably not clear enough why I pointed to the Labour example and what I was trying to get at, since I do not think your response here argues against what I was trying to say. It doesn't matter whether it should be worrying or not, if Labour has the support of these people because of a perceived anti-semitic stance. I do of course agree that this is indeed a worrying development, but it is certainly not a new one in far-left circles to have open anti-semitism.

The point I was trying to make is only, that it is possible for there to be one main issue where there is overlap between, in the case of Labour, the far-left of a left-wing party and some far-right figures, which leads to those far-right figures to genuinely prefer the left-wing politicians over any other candidates with realistic chances to win. So there is no way to know from your comment, if the endorsement by the NPD you mentioned did or did not follow a similar idea of being only a one issue endorsement.

To maybe get away from the hypothetical, that is indeed how I read the endorsement, if the one by Thorsten Heise is the one you are referencing. From what I read after a quick google search he said, that to get the immigrants out of Germany he reluctantly supports voting for the AfD, since he considers that the best chance to reach that goal. You are more than welcome to educate me here on the specifics of the issue, since I really just looked it up for a minute on google.

To reiterate again, to my knowledge the AfD is indeed part of the far-right populist movements, which popped up all over the West in the last years and I agree, that they are very much dangerous and it is a worrying sign to see them with such a large share of the votes in this local election. 

My worry and why I pointed out the issue I have with your original comment is, that I fear them doing more harm than good. I can see people reading your comment and go 'that doesn't make any sense', because of a similar thought process. And if they do not have any further knowledge of the AfD, it validates to some extent the idea of the victim complex a lot of far-right media on the internet spreads: They are all against us and discrediting us with invalid Nazi comparisons, come here for the real news!",,/r/europe/comments/dnwg4c/germany_thuringia_regional_election_exit_poll/f5k86m2/,c5k9,1572257390

That said, while I personally believe that conservative values towards marriage/partners most likely improve the stability of an household, I also think that these generally suppress both men and women in a harmful manner.         

""Liberal"" societies having more violence towards female spouses may be the result of how women feel more self-empowered resulting in more clashes between partners.

2713,"In 2018, about 3.2 million first residence permits were issued in the European Union (EU) to non-EU citizens. The number increased by 0.4% (or 13 000) compared with 2017, continuing the upward trend observed in each of the three previous years. Family reasons accounted for almost 28% of all first residence permits issued in the EU in 2018, employment reasons for 27%, education reasons for 20%, while other reasons, including international protection, accounted for 24%.

The increase in the total number of first residence permits in 2018 in comparison with 2017 was mainly due to the increasing number of first permits issued for education reasons (up by 110 000, or 21%) and family reasons (up by 83 000, or 10%), whereas the number of first permits issued for employment reasons decreased by 124 000 (-12%) and for other reasons by 56 000 (-7%).

Highest number of first residence permits issued in Poland, Germany and the United Kingdom 

In 2018, one out of five first residence permits was issued in Poland (635 000, or 20% of total permits issued in the EU), followed by Germany (544 000, or 17%), the United Kingdom (451 000, or 14%), France (265 000, or 8%), Spain (260 000, also 8%), Italy (239 000, or 7%) and Sweden (125 000, or 4%). Compared to the population of each Member State, the highest rates of first resident permits issued in 2018 were recorded in Malta (35 permits issued per thousand population), Cyprus (24), Poland (17), Slovenia (14) and Luxembourg (13). For the EU as a whole in 2018, 6 first residence permits were issued per thousand population. For employment in Poland, for education in the United Kingdom Poland with 328 000 permits (or 37% of all permits issued for employment reasons in the EU in 2018) was the top country for employment related permits. The United Kingdom with 190 000 permits (or 30%) was the top country in the EU for education related reasons. With 100 000 or more permits each, Germany (191 000, or 21%), Spain (134 000, or 15%), Italy (122 000, or 13%) and the United Kingdom (101 000, or 11%) were the four Member States with the highest number of permits issued for family reasons in 2018. Germany was also the top country in the EU for other reasons with 219 000 permits (28%), issued in 2018, of which the majority were for refugee status and subsidiary protection (185 000) and protection for humanitarian reasons (23 000). 

About half of residence permits granted to ten citizenships 

In 2018, citizens of Ukraine (527 000 beneficiaries, of which almost 78% in Poland) continued to receive the highest number of permits in the EU, ahead of citizens of China (206 000, of which almost half in the United Kingdom), India (197 000, of which 38% in the United Kingdom), Syria (174 000, of which 71% in Germany), Belarus (138 000, of which 92% in Poland), Morocco (127 000, of which 45% in Spain), the United States (120 000, of which 36% in the United Kingdom), Brazil (88 000, of which 32% in Portugal), Turkey (80 000, of which 29% in Germany) and Russia (75 000, of which 18% in Germany).

&gt;So this is not ""small business"" as used as a very broad term by you. You make it sound like any blog or website falls under this. It doesn't. Which is why I asked you multiple times if you even know the scope of the directive, because it sure doesn't sound like you do.

WTF you think I was talking about? A mom &amp; pop store? Of course any business, small or large, falls under article 13. If you offer a forum service, you fall under this regulation.

&gt;Which means that even if you fall under the scope of the directive, you will only be liable if there are suitable and effective means which your business can afford are not used. This also means that your hypothetical ""small business"" does not fall under it, since those measures are expensive and thus only needed for the large platforms that make a lot of money.

Don't put the cart before the horse. You still have to ask for authorization. Potentially billions of copyright holders, in theory. You have to make a best effort - basically to contact every one of them. Only then do we get to the upload paragraph. 

Then you will have to do ""something"", because nothing won't cut it. And as soon as anyone offers an upload filter for cheap, in exchange for ads, or even for free (Google, Facebook etc), you will have to implement it. Which means: upload filters for everyone.

&gt;You are the one not even looking into the scope of the matter you are discussing and you seem to not even grasp that people making things deserve compensation for that. Yet you complain that I am not ""very bright"".

Yourself.

&gt;Then I ask again, do you work for free? If you are against any type of copyright, then you think that people creating things like books, music, movies, news articles, etc, do not deserve a living of their work and everyone should just be allowed to consume it for free.

Rudyard Kipling's If is very popular, as is Ulysses by Tennyson and Invictus by William Ernest Henley. I may be a biased source though, as these poems are very male orientated and I am a man. For something that has a bit of a broader appeal, I expect the poem ""And did those feet in ancient time"" by William Blake might be the best one to suggest. It's primarily known nowadays as a church hymn set to music (by Sir Hubert Parry - video below): 

And did those feet in ancient time,
Walk upon Englands mountains green:
And was the holy Lamb of God,
On Englands pleasant pastures seen!

And did the Countenance Divine,
Shine forth upon our clouded hills?
And was Jerusalem builded here,
Among these dark Satanic Mills?

Bring me my Bow of burning gold:
Bring me my Arrows of desire:
Bring me my Spear: O clouds unfold:
Bring me my Chariot of fire!

I will not cease from Mental Fight,
Nor shall my Sword sleep in my hand:
Till we have built Jerusalem,
In Englands green &amp; pleasant Land.

For all the talk of great writers of epics and stories that you all speak of for your homes, Shakespeare is our most celebrated and I think most beautiful wordsmith, even if his talents do not lie in verse. But you already knew that! :D
Unfortunately I wouldn't call him our most popular - though he is celebrated I would gauge him to be horribly underread, as the English is a little hard to understand.

2883,"In 2018, industry was still the largest economic activity in the European Union (EU) in terms of output generated. It accounted for 19.1% of EU total [gross value added](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Glossary:Gross_value_added)[ ](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Glossary:Gross_value_added)(GVA), immediately ahead of the economic activities ""Wholesale and retail trade, transport, accommodation and food services"" (19.0%) and ""Public administration, defence, education, human health and social work activities"" (18.6%). ""Professional, scientific and technical activities"" (11.5%) and ""Real estate activities"" (11.2%) also accounted for a significant share of EU total gross value added. 

The respective shares of these economic activities have, however, followed diverging trends over the last 20 years. The percentage of gross value added that was generated grew in ""Professional, scientific and technical activities"" (from 9.2% in 1998 to 11.5% in 2018, or +2.3 percentage points (pp)), ""Public administration, defence, education, human health and social work activities"" (+1.1 pp), ""Real estate activities"" (+0.7 pp) as well as in ""Information and communication"" (+0.6 pp).

It remained fairly stable in “Arts, entertainment &amp; recreation; other services” and “Financial &amp; insurance activities” (both +0.1 pp) as well as in “Construction” (-0.2 pp) and ""Wholesale and retail trade, transport, accommodation and food services"" (-0.3%).

In contrast, the share of gross value added that was generated in “Industry” decreased significantly (from 22.6% in 1998 to 19.1% in 2018, or -3.5 pp) as did that of “Agriculture, forestry and fishing” (-0.8 pp).

In 8 EU Member States, ""Industry"" came first, whilst it accounted for at least a quarter of gross value added generated in these EU Member States: Ireland (36.5%), Czechia (30.2%), followed by Slovenia (26.9%), Romania (26.1%), Slovakia (25.7%), Germany (25.4%), Poland (25.0%, although it was not the largest economic activity in Poland) and Hungary (24.8%).

2888,"CDU/CSU had long had the motto ""to the right of us there's only the wall"". So they wouldn't accept any more right wing party than themselves. This changed a bit after the Schröder years, because Schröder was able to build a majority for SPD and Greens, with CDU and FDP to their right and PDS (predecessor of Die Linke) to their left. Quite a shock for CDU/CSU after 16 years of Kohl, 16 years of a clear CDU/CSU+FDP majority.

This forced them to move a bit more to the center and give up some of their ideas that now had a clear majority aginst them. That's the key of Merkel's policy. Still conservative, but ""pragmatic"" in the way that she didn't try to conserve old values and ideas that the vast majority of the population had already left behind. That's the space that AfD took over, promoting ideas that the majority of the population opposes today. They're also clearly ""against the system"", while CDU/CSU is ""the system"", so that's another major difference.

Trying to fit anything ""in between"" the CDU and AfD has an additional complication. The CDU is a normal part of the political spectrum. The AfD isn't. The AfD is essentially outside of the spectrum, doing its own thing, hating everybody else and being hated by everybody else. Their voters largely live inside of their own bubble. You can compare it to the US, where there are the Republicans living in one world and the Democrats living in another. They use different sources of information, get completely different suggestions from social media, etc. The difference is that in the US, this division is roughly 50:50 while in Germany it's more 80:20. CDU/CSU, SPD, FDP, Greens, and Left are all still much more similar to each other, and willing to work with one another, than AfD.

I always like [this](https://www.insa-consulere.de/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MT_21-10-2019_Potentialanalyse-page-001.jpg) poll presentation. It shows not only who people would want vote for (solid color), but also voters of other parties who might consider voting for a party (lighter shade), and voters who are fundamentally opposed to a party (brown). So yes, nationally 15% of people would vote for the AfD, but just 5% of the people would consider voting for them but aren't already, and 70% of the population are fundamentally opposed to them.

All other parties have a lot more people who would consider voting for them, but don't. This is because a CDU voter may also like FDP or SPD a bit, or a Die Linke voter might also like the Greens, etc. But only AfD voters like AfD, and they like no other party except AfD. In fact, once I even saw one where they looked at where those ""brown bars"" represent, and it's no surprise that for all other parties, a large part of those roughly 25% who are fundamentally opposed to them were AfD voters.

The poll also shows how many of them are already certain how they will vote, and for AfD, that's 11%, which is more than ⅔ of AfD voters. So any new right wing party would probably fail to attract any of the 11% hardcore AfD voters, but if they are not clearly, strongly, and openly opposed to AfD, they will fail to attract any of the 70% of the population who are fundamentally opposed to AfD. So I have no idea who would even vote for them. BTW, the AfD has already broken apart twice. Whenever the party leadership has changed, the old party leader has started their own party. Lucke did with LKR and Petry did with ""the blue party"". Both are complete failures.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/dnwg4c/germany_thuringia_regional_election_exit_poll/f5juvpj/,muehsam,1572241966

Barbaric is just the word, a roman concept of an abject group of people, inferior, savage. I guarantee you the goths, visigoths and ostrogoths and many others did not think of themselves that way. To think in this way is to be as rationally limited as the romans were in their proud and foolish ways. There is no absolute right and wrong, only the accepted practices and culture of the many societies. Of course, it's important to try to find a sensible path, not to reject all pre established conceptions of right and wrong. I for one would never cannibalize anyone, but neither would I do as many of the men in my country did, to go into an indian camp, kill them with muskets, rape their women, and take many of them into slavery, and to think it justified as they were stopping the ""evils"" of cannibalism (through rituals filled with significance, so much so the captured warriors accepted their fate, they were never bound, if they wished they could've simply escaped). To be able to properly tell right from wrong, I think it's important to be able to recognize these established, ""absolute"" rights and wrongs, and then to form a character of strong moral fiber resulting from this understanding, an independent but sensible stance, and maybe most important of all, come to respect other people's culture even with differences sometimes irreconcilable with yours (Which is definitely the case for me personally with many things like FGM, hijabs, and anthropophagy)

The fist thing to take into account about the different police behaviour is that this march was planned and authorized by the government, which means it really did not need riot gear. On Saturday there was a planned demonstration of independentists and the police were equipped in a similar manner (there were more policeman but that was probably because the independentists demonstration was larger)

As for the fascism, the only thing I can say is that these kind of pro Spain demonstration attract such people , but by no means they are the majority.

You are correct in saying however that there is an upsurge of fascists in spain, with the main culprit being the backlash against the Catalan independence movement making their views seem less extreme.

2971,"&gt; So, Poland should consider itself lucky to be so large.

No it shouldn't, because it was it was larger before. 

&gt;Poles were not historically a majority, and that based on Polish ethnic majority alone, Poland would be smaller as a nation

Because ""Poles"" back then didn't always peak Polish and language wasn't tied to nationality like it was after the 20th century. In fact, i remember reading that nobles from GDL actually spoke better Polish than those from crown lands who often used Latin and probably German since they dealt with German mercenaries a lot.  The explanation the book gave for this was that with Polonisation being mostly for the nobility, they wanted to distinguish them selves from there Ruthenian subjects. I can find the quote from the book if you would like but I got to search. 

What people tend to forget that Poland used to be very much an immigrant country like today's America, its just that they were all white so many do not realize this.  You can see this is Polish peoples DNA, it is approximately 1/4 Germanic, this is from all the immigrants that moved to the kingdom.",,/r/europe/comments/dnr58r/ethnic_layout_in_central_europe_on_the_eve_of/f5jme01/,anon086421,1572232702

3012,"Half Life 2's plot is friendly to new players, and will give you a basic recap of what's happened. You can jump right in and play. It's not absolutely necessary, but I would recommend playing Half Life 1 first it to get a better understanding of the overall story.  HL2 will make little references/easter eggs to HL1 you'll appreciate more otherwise. I actually finished HL2 before going back to HL1, and didn't have any problems. 

The original HL1 may be a bit dated by today's standards, but I found it still quite playable. If you would prefer a more updated version, you could play the fan made Black Mesa, which has updated graphics and controls, although it is missing the final boss level to Xen (I'm not sure if they made an update to that, it's been quite some time since I played it.) 

HL2 also has an additional smaller sequels called Episode 1 and 2, which continue on from the plot of HL2. These are much shorter and can be beaten in a couple of hours. Valve at the time made the decision to release in this format for faster releases, but they haven't made anything since then (Thus the infamous HL3 confirmed memes) 

There's also 2 spinoffs from HL1 called Blue Shift and Opposing Force. These are totally optional and you don't need to play these, but if you find you enjoy the game and want to get more in depth, you could try these after the main games.

////
So recommended playthrough: HL1, HL2, HL2 Episode 1, HL2 Episode 2

Alternate playthrough: HL2, HL1,HL2 Episode 1, HL2 Episode 2

Optional: HL1 Blue Shift, HL1 Opposing (Order doesn't matter)
////

As always, don't burn out playing the games and pace yourself. the story and gameplay are well worth it, and you'll be in for the ride of a lifetime. I'm actually jealous that you're about to experience Half Life for the first time.

 There really isn't any other game that comes close its unique atmosphere. HL1 has a feeling of claustrophobic isolation and survival, while HL2 is more guerilla type sneaking around outdoors (Without too much spoilers)

tl;dr: Doesn't really matter, but lore wise it would make sense to go by chronological order. Also has 2 very optional spinoffs.",,/r/europe/comments/dnqolk/norilsk_russia/f5j69im/,BangedTheKeyboard,1572221851

3186,"So at the same time you get a bit offended when you think I accuse you of stealing. And then the next moment you say copyright is a made up thing you are against anyway. I mean... what do you get from your text here, that you are someone who minds infringing on copyright?

&gt;This is just again an emotional argument, not based on facts.

Your whole argument right now comes down to you not liking copyright and therefore any laws around it. That to me sounds way more emotional.

&gt;I have copied the relevant section of the directive for you:  
&gt;  
&gt;\[..\]  
&gt;  
&gt;Thus, your company is only exempt from this regulation if both apply. If your company is older than 3 years, well shit, you have to comply. So much for targeting only large companies.

That is nice, but not the relevant section we are talking about. Let's look at the scope first:

&gt;Member States shall provide that an online content sharing service provider performs an act of communication to the public or an act of making available to the public for the purposes of this Directive when it gives the public access to copyright protected works or other protected subject matter uploaded by its users.

So this is not ""small business"" as used as a very broad term by you. You make it sound like any blog or website falls under this. It doesn't. Which is why I asked you multiple times if you even know the scope of the directive, because it sure doesn't sound like you do.

Then let's look when such a company will be liable:

&gt;In determining whether the service provider has complied with its obligations under paragraph 4, and in light of the principle of proportionality, the following elements, among others, shall be taken into account:  
&gt;  
&gt;(a) the type, the audience and the size of the service and the type of works or other subject matter uploaded by the users of the service; and  
&gt;  
&gt;(b) **the availability of suitable and effective means and their cost for service providers.**

Which means that even if you fall under the scope of the directive, you will only be liable if there are suitable and effective means which your business can afford are not used. This also means that your hypothetical ""small business"" does not fall under it, since those measures are expensive and thus only needed for the large platforms that make a lot of money.

&gt;I use simple examples to make you understand. you don't seem very bright, that's on you.

You are the one not even looking into the scope of the matter you are discussing and you seem to not even grasp that people making things deserve compensation for that. Yet you complain that I am not ""very bright"".

&gt;I stand against the general idea of intellectual property, the specific implementation of the law is not relevant for that matter.

Then I ask again, do you work for free? If you are against any type of copyright, then you think that people creating things like books, music, movies, news articles, etc, do not deserve a living of their work and everyone should just be allowed to consume it for free.

They get the money from the search ads around content they index, then on the websites they get money from the ads there since it runs through their exchanges, on Youtube they get money from the content placed there that uses things made by other people, they bump up pages that run AMP in which they set the rules on how ads are done, these days they scrape content and just straight up push it into their results taking away incentives to go to a website.

3346,"Just meters away from the glitter of the cafes of Via Veneto, the church of Santa Maria della Concezione stands near Piazza Barberini, with Bernini's fountain of Triton and the Palazzo Barberini.

After the church was finished in 1631, Cardinal Antonio Marcello Barberini, who was a member of the Capuchin friars, ordered that the remains of the members of his order be moved from the cemetery to the church’s crypt.

The bones were to be placed on the walls in a specific way, creating different motifs and designs full of religious symbolism, a site were the friars would come to reflect and pray.    

The crypt is divided into six pocket-sized chapels, decorated with the bones of 4,000 Capuchin friars who died between 1528 and 1870. The effect is as shocking as it is macabre.

As well as the walls covered in individual bones, the chapels also house truely chilling whole skeletons dressed with the Capuchin brown habit. 

Despite what it might seem, the ossuary is an imaginative cult for the dead, which only seeks to demonstrate that the body merely contains the soul.

The Marquis de Sade noted that he found his 1775 journey to the crypt was worth the effort, and Nathaniel Hawthorne noted its grotesque nature in his 1860 novel The Marble Faun.

As of 1851, the crypt was only opened to the public, in exchange for an admittance fee, for the week following All Souls Day.",Südtirol best Tirol,/r/europe/comments/dnx7c5/spooktober_in_europe_the_crypt_of_the_capuchins/f5h3pmh/,standy85,1572200065

3355,"Short answer: Yes, of course.

Ready for some information overload for the long answer?

The long form is Nationalsozialist (national socialist). ""Nation"" is a loanword from Latin and for some reason (I'm sure someone here can explain why exactly) Latin loanwords ending in -tio or -tion came to be pronounced -tsio(n) in German just like they are pronounced -sho(n) in English.

So the word is spoken ""natsionalsotsialist"", and ""Nazi"" was a sarcastic joke pun because it sounded like the beginning of the word and at the same time was a nickname for the given name Ignaz (Ignatius, pronounced ""Eegnahts""), a stereotypically country bumpkin name. As somebody once wrote, it was as if you'd call KKK folks ""Cleetuses"" except with a pun.

3497,"&gt;So now you agree they aren't tech savvy? Before you seemed to want to argue otherwise. Of course I agree they should still make laws and rely on experts. However if I saw them writing as complex a directive about how farmers can or can't plant that causes more problems and does little to solve the intended problem, I would complain that they have far overstepped their understanding just like I am here.

Depends on the lawmaker. But it is not necessary to be tech savvy to make a law around the issue. Just like in the examples I named. And yes, we have a ton of laws around things like farming that farmers think of: these people don't understand it at all! Yet we have them for various reasons.

&gt;As to you questioning if these companies should exist at all I am of course in strong disagreement. Many new technologies threaten the livelihood of a small number of people while having diffuse and hard to quantify benefits for the population as a whole. Just because the small disadvantages are more easy to see and quantify does not make me (or the benefitting majority) willing to give it up nor do I feel morally obligated to.

This is why I put ""in their current form"" there. I think we should place these kind of limitations and responsibilities on them, because otherwise it will do more and more damage. Does that mean the current regulations are perfect? Probably not, but it is better then doing nothing.

You say that new technologies threaten livelihoods. But that we should basically just deal with it. Then why are we not telling Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc, to just deal with the regulations we make for them? I always see this as such a double standard. We apparently just need to deal with the damage they do, but putting limitations on them is somehow bad because it is damaging to their business model.

3503,"[Mining began in the Norilsk area in the 1920s. The Soviet government created the ""Norilsk Combine"" in 1935 and passed control to the NKVD. In 1943 Norilsk produced 4,000 tons of refined nickel and in 1945 hit the target figure of 10,000 tons. Mining and metal production continued first with Gulag forced labour, later with much volunteer labour owing to the comparatively good wages offered. In 1993 after the fall of the Soviet Union a joint-stock company was created, RAO Norilsk Nickel. Two years afterwards control over the deeply indebted company, which was bleeding cash at a rate of about $2m a day amid falling nickel prices, was given to a private company Interros. By the time the privatization was completed in 1997, the company became profitable and the workers were paid. Nowadays average pay is over $1,000 per month and workers enjoy two to three months of vacations; nevertheless, working and living conditions in Norilsk remain harsh. ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nornickel)",,/r/europe/comments/dnqolk/norilsk_russia/f5fphot/,thehousebehind,1572185303

3529,"&gt;The upload filter concentrate a lot of power in the hands of already powerful companies

Sounds to me like you want an independent organization to take over the checking of content. Right now Google and Facebook already set rules for their platforms on what is allowed or not. Is that then also too much power for them?

You seem to see these services as a public service, yet they are run by companies without the regulation in place to ensure they are working for the public good. Facebook tomorrow can say: we do not allow any videos from videogames anymore, because it upsets our advertisers. And there is nothing you can do about it, that is their right as a private company at the moment.

So if they are to be seen as public services, do we then also need to implement regulations to make sure they follow the rules society makes for them?

&gt;For all we know, it could be a reasonably small issue that could be fixed by using other means, but the EU decided it is more appropriate to use a hammer. I, as well as many other people, assume there will be huge number of false positives, leading to a strong restriction of the freedom of the internet.

At the same time you say the EU has not looked enough at the scope, you make assumptions about the range of content that will be blocked without those studies also.

&gt;Also, this power is almost certain to be destined for abuse. For example, once the technology is up and running, China will certainly be pleased with this kind of ability to restrict content distribution. It's not to say, that it wouldn't happen without article 13, but this certainly accelerates the process. Google wouldn't even be able to tell the Chinese government that they are not able to do it. The EU will force Google to be able to monitor content uploads basically in real time.

That is up to Google to decide whether they want to be active in the Chinese market under those conditions though. I always find the arguments around China such nonsense, as if their government is looking at the EU for what they should do in their own country.

&gt;joint invasion

Germany invaded 1th september, USSR - 17, when goverment was already gone, and UK-France couldn't declare war on USSR too (as Polish ally). Though phoney war wasn't scary, as we saw.

&gt;was far better to be in Lviv than in UkSSR when USSR starved out millions of Ukrainians to force collectivization upon them

What documents have you read about collectivization and famine 32-33? None, just ""Holodomor"" propaganda? Like you did about GULag?

And, what's even more funny, there was hunger in Poland, and exactly in Lvov, exactly same years.

&gt;Ah yes when USSR annexes Bessarabia it is justified similarly when they execute thousands or millions of people it is justified.

See, you fail to answer, because nobody recognized this little rat invasions after WW1 on the ruins of Russian Empire.

And you'll fail again to bring evidence about millions of executed - you know why? Because you don't know anything, still pretend to, chatterbox.

3630,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_views_of_Adolf_Hitler

&gt;Adolf Hitler's religious beliefs have been a matter of debate; the wide consensus of historians consider him to have been irreligious, anti-Christian, anti-clerical and scientistic.[1] In light of evidence such as his fierce criticism and vocal rejection of the tenets of Christianity,[2] numerous private statements to confidants denouncing Christianity as a harmful superstition,[1] and his strenuous efforts to reduce the influence and independence of Christianity in Germany after he came to power, Hitler's major academic biographers conclude that he was irreligious and an opponent of Christianity.[1] Historian Laurence Rees found no evidence that ""Hitler, in his personal life, ever expressed belief in the basic tenets of the Christian church"".[3] Ernst Hanfstaengl, a friend from his early days in politics, says Hitler ""was to all intents and purposes an atheist by the time I got to know him"". However, historians such as Richard Weikart and Alan Bullock doubt the assessment that he was a true atheist, suggesting that despite his dislike of Christianity he still clung to a form of spiritual belief.[4]
&gt;
&gt;Hitler was born to a practicing Catholic mother, and was baptized in the Roman Catholic Church. From a young age, he expressed disbelief and hostility to Christianity.[5] But in 1904, acquiescing to his mother's wish, he was confirmed at the Roman Catholic Cathedral in Linz, Austria, where the family lived.[6] According to John Willard Toland, witnesses indicate that Hitler's confirmation sponsor had to ""drag the words out of him ... almost as though the whole confirmation was repugnant to him"".[7] Rissmann notes that, according to several witnesses who lived with Hitler in a men's home in Vienna, Hitler never again attended Mass or received the sacraments after leaving home.[8] Several eyewitnesses who lived with Hitler while he was in his late teens and early-to-mid 20s in Vienna state that he never attended church after leaving home at 18.[8]
&gt;
&gt;In Hitler's early political statements, he attempted to express himself to the German public as a Christian.[9] In his book Mein Kampf and in public speeches prior to and in the early years of his rule, he described himself as a Christian.[10][11] Hitler and the Nazi party promoted ""Positive Christianity"",[12] a movement which rejected most traditional Christian doctrines such as the divinity of Jesus, as well as Jewish elements such as the Old Testament.[13][14] In one widely quoted remark, he described Jesus as an ""Aryan fighter"" who struggled against ""the power and pretensions of the corrupt Pharisees""[15] and Jewish materialism.[16]
&gt;
&gt;While a small minority of historians accept these publicly stated views as genuine expressions of his spirituality,[9] the vast majority believe that Hitler was skeptical of religion and anti-Christian, but recognized that he could only be elected and preserve his political power if he feigned a commitment to and belief in Christianity, which the overwhelming majority of Germans believed in.[17] Privately, Hitler repeatedly deprecated Christianity, and told confidants that his reluctance to make public attacks on the Church was not a matter of principle, but a pragmatic political move.[18] In his private diaries, Goebbels wrote in April 1941 that though Hitler was ""a fierce opponent"" of the Vatican and Christianity, ""he forbids me to leave the church. For tactical reasons.""[19] Hitler's remarks to confidants, as described in the Goebbels Diaries, the memoirs of Albert Speer, and transcripts of Hitler's private conversations recorded by Martin Bormann in Hitler's Table Talk, are further evidence of his irreligious and anti-Christian beliefs;[1] these sources record a number of private remarks in which Hitler ridicules Christian doctrine as absurd, contrary to scientific advancement, and socially destructive.[1][20]
&gt;
&gt;Once in office, Hitler and his regime sought to reduce the influence of Christianity on society.[21] From the mid-1930s, his government was increasingly dominated by militant anti-church proponents like Goebbels, Bormann, Himmler, Rosenberg and Heydrich whom Hitler appointed to key posts.[22] These anti-church radicals were generally permitted or encouraged to perpetrate the Nazi persecutions of the churches.[23] The regime launched an effort toward coordination of German Protestants under a unified Protestant Reich Church (but this was resisted by the Confessing Church), and moved early to eliminate political Catholicism.[24] Hitler agreed to the Reich concordat with the Vatican, but then routinely ignored it, and permitted persecutions of the Catholic Church.[25] Smaller religious minorities faced harsher repression, with the Jews of Germany expelled for extermination on the grounds of Nazi racial ideology. Jehovah's Witnesses were ruthlessly persecuted for refusing both military service and allegiance to Hitler's movement. Hitler said he anticipated a coming collapse of Christianity in the wake of scientific advances, and that Nazism and religion could not co-exist long term.[1] Although he was prepared to delay conflicts for political reasons, historians conclude that he ultimately intended the destruction of Christianity in Germany, or at least its distortion or subjugation to a Nazi outlook.[26]",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/dnilk2/percentage_of_nazi_votes_in_1932_vs_religious/f5f4w18/,duisThias,1572178306

3735,"Second time I read today praise for Kipling, curious thing.

For the Netherlands it could be Memory of Holland (Herinnering aan Holland) by Hendrik Marsman:

Thinking about Holland,	

I see wide-flowing rivers	

slowly traversing	

infinite plains,	

inconceivably	

rarefied poplars	

like lofty plumes	

on the skyline in lanes;	

and submerged in the vastness	

of unbounded spaces,	

the farm houses	

strewn over the land,	

tree clumps, villages,	

truncated towers,	

churches and elm trees	

all wondrously planned	

the sky hangs low	

and slowly the sun by	

mists of all colours	

is stifled and greyed	

and in all the regions	

the voice of the water	

with its endless disasters	

is feared and obeyed.

Translation by [Paul Vincent](http://www.vlinder-01.dds.nl/cdr/poetry/memory_of_holland.htm).

I think it is pretty obvious what it tells about our country. He wrote it on vacation in the Mediterranean sea. It is representative of Marsman's later style where he moved from an expressionistic style to a more naturalistic/realistic style. The rivers he is referring to are the many rivers in the region in and around the Betuwe or Rivierenland where you'd find a view like [this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6f/Acquoy_in_de_verte..jpg). One of the most fertile regions in the Netherlands, where the Meuse and Rhine river come very close. It talks about the typical idyllic Dutch landscape. And of course our ethernal struggle against the water.  Don't know if it is the most influential but it is I think the most representative. It is certainly one of those poems you dissect in high school.

The most famous are probably the poems in Multatuli's Max Havelaar. That is a work of prose, but it has a few poems in it. It is often regarded as the No. 1 Dutch book. The book features a character, Droogstoppel, who dislikes poetry and thinks it is unchristian and full of lies. The themes of the book are very anti-colonialist, which was very progressive since it was published in 1860. It brought to light the oppression that we did in Indonesia, which Multatuli, pseudonym of Eduard Douwes Dekker, had witnessed first hand. It is a complex book but one of the stories he uses is the story of Saïdjah en Adinda. You should really read the [full excerpt](https://www.berfrois.com/2012/12/max-havelaar-multatuli/)(or the whole book, it has been translated in a lot of languages), but it ends with a heartbreaking poem:

I know not where I will die.

I saw the great sea on the South shore, where I was with my father to make salt.

If I die at sea, my body will be thrown in the deep water, and there will be sharks.

They shall swim around my body and ask: who will devour the body that sinks there in the water?

I shall not hear it.

I know not where I will die.

I saw the burning house of Pa-ansoe, which he had set ablaze himself, because he was mata-glap.

If I die in a burning house, glowing pieces of wood will fall on my body.

And outside people will shout and throw water to kill the fire.

I shall not hear it.

I know not where I will die.

I saw little Si-oenah who fell from a klappa tree, when he picked a klappa for his mother.

If I fall from a klappa tree, I will be dead on the ground, in the bushes, like Si-oenah.

My mother shall not weep, for she is dead. But others will shout with loud voices: Behold there is Saïdjah!

I shall not hear it.

I know not where I will die.

I saw the body of Pa-lisoe, who died of age, for his hair was white.

If I die of age, with white hair, wailing women will stand around my body.

And they shall weep, just like the wailing women at Pa-lisoe’s body.

And the little children will weep, very loud.

I shall not hear it.

we drink it and drink it

we spade out a grave in the air there it won't feel so tight

A man lives at home who plays with the vipers he writes

he writes in the German-born nightfall

the gold of your hair Margarete

he writes it and steps out of doors and the stars are aglitter he whistles his hounds out

he whistles his Jews off has them spade out a grave in the ground

he orders us play up for the dance

 

Black milk of daybreak we drink you come night

we drink you come midday come morning we drink you come evening

we drink you and drink you

A man lives at home who plays with the vipers he writes

he writes in the German-born nightfall the gold of your hair Margarete

the ash of your hair Shulamith we spade out a grave in the air there it won't feel so tight

 

He yells you there dig deeper and you there sing and play

He grabs the nightstick at his belt and swings it his eyes are so blue

You there dig deeper and you there play loud for the dance

 

Black milk of daybreak we drink you come night

We drink you come midday come morning we drink you come evening

We drink you and drink you

a man lives at home the gold of your hair Margarete

the ash of your hair Shulamith he plays with the vipers

he yells play sweeter for death Death is a German-born master

yells scrape the strings darker you'll rise through the air like smoke

and have a grave in the clouds there it won't feel so tight

 

Black milk of daybreak we drink you come night

we drink you come midday Death is a German-born master

We drink you come evening come morning we drink you and drink you

Death is a German-born master his eye is so blue

He shoots with lead bullets he shoots you his aim is so true

a man lives at home the gold of your hair Margarete

he lets his hounds loose on us grants us a grave in the air

he plays with his vipers and dreams a dream Death is a German-born master

 

The gold of your hair Margarete

The ash of your hair Shulamith

3868,"Some will say Iliad or Odyssey by Homer, but I dont think they reflect anything that has to do with modern Greece. They are pretty much known worldwide though. Especially Odyssey for its universal appeal and messege. 

However, the poem that captures the Greek ""torment"", the lives of Greek people from the independence up until now, but especially the times of WWII is Romiosini by Yiannis Ritsos. Ritsos was a communist, a deal breaker for many, but he was a great poet. He won the Lenin Prize for Peace since because of his beliefs he could not a win the Nobel prize for Literature. 

Romiosini says the story of Greeks fighting. Fighting to have one load of bread on their table, fighting against external forces , fighting against themselves, fighting against memory, fighting against time etc and everything comes to an end when the ""hero"" of the story comes back to his village. In my opinion it captures the essence of Greece and will always be the best poem (collection) by a Greek poet. It certainly gains influance from many others before him ( for example homer) but it is done in a whole other way. The hero is not like Odysseys, it's pretty much the reality of what would happen. 

When the poem ends it just leaves you with a bittersweet taste, the best taste in my opinion. You are getting all teary reading it and at the same time proud, in a sense. These poems also became songs by Miki Theodorakis, and they are pretty much well known in Greece. 

However my favourite version is a recording where Yiannis Ritsos himself reads the poem accompanied by the Mayroudis in guitar.

But maybe it doesn't matter for you. Since even Krakow had german majority in medieval times....

&gt; Doesn't matter, this dynasty was already germanized and most of Wrocław's population, especially merchants, were of German origin. And obviously they borrowed architectural patterns from Germany.

Visually, there is nothing closer to silesian gothic than gothic from Małopolska (except those few cathedrals made out of stone).  

&gt; Only in Poland choosing an architectural style was such an important political declaration.

I think neo-gothic style in Germany had pretty big ideological baggage. And if I'm not mistaken Czechs also chose neo-gothic as their national style for all those reason as Poles - as opposition to colorful Habsburg baroque.

https://time.com/4084301/hitler-grand-mufi-1941/

&gt; This week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sparked a wave of backlash when he argued that the Holocaust was the brainchild of the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Haj Amin al-Husseini, who, Netanyahu claimed, suggested killing the Jews (rather than merely expelling them) to Hitler during a 1941 visit to Berlin. As it happens, the full German record of the meeting between al-Husseini and Hitler, on Nov. 28, 1941, was published half a century ago, and is readily available online. It is a fascinating and important document. Not only does it make clear that Netanyahu’s accusation is false, but it also sheds light on the true origins of the Holocaust, and why Hitler undertook it when he did.

Yes, we don’t need GM foods. We also don’t need tractors or fertiliser to feed people either. We could use medieval farming techniques, if we really wanted, and employ like 80% of the population in the agrarian sector.

Tractors, fertilisers, pesticides, and GM crops, are all just tools we have to make farming more efficient. If you’re fine with banning GM crops, then you have to be fine with the consequences.   The consequences in this case are a lot of blind kids.

4060,"It's surprisingly hard to find something in English on the quick. Essentially how this worked was: You needed permission/license to recruit mercenaries in the cantons and at least officially any Swiss man needed permission to serve abroad. It was also attractive, especially for poor farmer sons, for the usual reasons: Survive, spoils of war, return home rich. It usually didn't work out. To give permission the canton governments (parliaments, statesmen, cardinals, majors etc.) were effectively bribed with so called pensions. Military service in militias was also mandatory and entire regiments of those would go into foreign service.

When a period is contemporary to you, you are exposed to the whole range of quality of work within that period. When you look back at works created before the period that is contemporary to you, the poorer works tend to be forgotten and the greatest works are what are remembered and documented, so it is very easy to fall into the trap of ""most things today suck compared to what came before"". 

Music is a prime example, pick any decade and you will find a range of people holding up that decade as the pinnacle of music, and claim everything current is terrible by comparison, but people only remember the hits of that decade and hold everything created now against the best of that decade,as they dont remember the mediocre songs that came and went unmarked.",,/r/europe/comments/dnicho/the_lion_of_lucerne/f5cvglw/,monkeyinnamonkeysuit,1572142425

On the other hand Gdansk was built mostly during the Renaissance and that has more to do with the Dutch architects that held the position as city architects more than German influence.  

Brick architecture in Poland has existed since the 12th century.  The specific red brick Gothic architecture you are thinking of, it is true it was popularized in northern Europe by the Hansiatic league because the northern European plane lacks enough stone and the Baltic sea made it convenient to ship the brick thought, but was actually already introduced in Poland by Dominicans and Franciscans in the 13th century.  It just want popular yet until the German Knights in Poland started building everything out it of. Its original origin is Northern Italy.

It's interesting you don't mention the pagan elements of the Völkisch movement, or the pagan occultism of such Nazi luminaries as Himmler - who also happened to be inspired by the Jesuit order's focus on obedience when founding the SS.

The reality is that Muslims were often the victims of Nazi slaughter and Arabs were viewed as a vastly inferior race.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#Nazi_Germany

&gt; Nazi ideology considered ethnic groups associated with Islam to be “racially inferior”, particularly Arabs.[165]

&gt; During the Invasion of France thousands of Muslims, both Arabs and sub-Saharan Africans, that were serving in French colonial units were captured by the Germans. Massacres of these men were widespread, most notably Moroccans in the fighting around Cambrai against Waffen SS troops, who were killed in mass after being driven from the outskirts of the city and surrendering.[166] Another major massacre against captured Muslim Senegalese troops took place at Erquinvillers by both Wehrmacht and Waffen SS troops.[167]

&gt; During Operation Barbarossa the Einsatzgruppen engaged in the mass execution of over 140,000 Soviet POWs,[168] many of whom were killed for being Muslim or having “Asiatic features”.[169][170] Civilian Muslim men were often mistaken for Jews due to being circumsized and killed.[171]",,/r/europe/comments/dnilk2/percentage_of_nazi_votes_in_1932_vs_religious/f5cx4br/,the_benighted_states,1572143758

by that logic, i can say that if you did not let eoka rise to power, your island wouldnt be divided today. actions that happened decades ago does not justify killing innocents.

As for the rest, I believe we're saying the same thing essentially. That Turks are savages whose main characteristic is expensionism and warfare is their natural state of being. War is the only thing we can be inferior at compared to Turks and I'll take that as something to be proud of. 
There's a bit of a difference with Alexander the Great. In lots of the places he conquered people greeted as a liberator and he actually improved the living conditions of the people. His wars were not meant to subjucate people and certainly not to eradicate them, but rather to elevate them. You can't even compare the Greek culture at the time, which was the most advanced of its time to Turkish culture at any point of its history. I don't even think Turks had a writing system, no written speech, literature or sciences, just savagery. Warfare is the spark and the basis of your civilization, even today. For us it's the opposite. Of course we have engaged in warfare and expansion as well, we were not exactly saints, but those were far from our greatest achievements. Romans conquered us through war also. And we ""conquered"" with our civilization. Ad we did with so many others. Turks like to point out how many turkish words modern greeks use, but they conveniently forget that one, there's always an additional greek word for every turkish word used in modern greek and second, turkish has a lot more greek words in its vocabulary and words for higher things, like scientific terms, philosophical ideas, etc.",,/r/europe/comments/dnaj3p/this_day_in_1912_thessaloniki_was_liberated_from/f5bzsa7/,katjepogrom,1572128239

I like to think about brutalism as the kind of aesthetic one tends to see in futuristic films like the old blade runner.

It’s cheaper to buy tickets in advance, but if you must pay on the day than the price to see just Neuschwanstein alone is about 2/3 therestoration cost of a combination ticket to see all three with car park costing €7.

These tours last only 35 minutes, and whilst you get taken through about 7 rooms including throne, hall and bed chamber they do provide a lot of interesting information about the life and times of Ludvig II.

It’s worth remembering that the castle is currently undergoing extensive restoration and so covered in scaffolding, scheduled to be finished in 2021. The castle itself was never completed before the death of Ludwig either, so certain elements like the throne itself are missing.

I don’t regret going, it’s a fantastic building with some great history, but it’s not like rolling up to Disney Castle if you have kids.

Yeah, no. That's not how German works. The whole point of the Umlaut is that it is the a change in the vowel sound that generally also conveys a semantic change.

Apples to oranges. You're comparing the 35 years of Korea under foreign rule to those of the Balkans under 500 years of foreign rule and the subsequent socio-economic recoveries that followed.

Ofc there are other differences as well; like the gigantic investment to the economy of South Korea by the west (I.e. USA) or the level of divide and rule tactics employed in the Balkan peninsula by the Ottomans (Hapsburgs and Russians too) that didn't exist (to the same extent) as in Korea or the importance that the Korean peninsula had/has between the three superpowers/great powers (USSR/Russia, USA, PRC), and thats just skimming the surface.

That's old trick.

There was no pact that agreed that, and Piłsudski  was dead by then. 

These 2 Villages were taken by Czechoslovakia from Poland during Polish-Soviet war. Sadly that made our countries hostile to eachother and instead of alliance against Hitler and Stalin we were fighting eachother. Fortunatly these days Poland, Czech and Slovaks are friendly towards eachother. 

Poland did not allow Hitler to take Czechoslovakia because simply he never asked and noone cared what we would say anyways. It was decided by Germany France Great Britian and Italy.

5135,"&gt;But the word sovranismo, a neologism that entered the common political discourse in the past couple of years, denotes something more radical than nationalism. It comes from the word sovrano, which means superior, as well as ruler, and speaks not just of the preservation and pride of a nation within itself, but of its superiority. Without getting into the nuances of political theory, it is easy for Italians to grasp the core notion of what sovranismo is about: the promise of Italian supremacy.

It is the same word as sovereign, and likely entered Italian political lexicon through the French ""souverainisme."" The word is associated with ruler, yes, because a monarch is sovereign, not just *a* sovereign. Same as how Parliament in your country is sovereign. It's primary meaning relates to independence, not superiority. Sovereignty politics revolve exclusively around independence from foreign interference from NGOs, supranational organizations, and international law. The premise that it is related to supremacy and superiority is completely erroneous.

5140,"They tick basically every property of fascism as Umberto Eco described it:

""The Cult of Tradition"", characterized by cultural syncretism, even at the risk of internal contradiction. When all truth has already been revealed by Tradition, no new learning can occur, only further interpretation and refinement.
""The Rejection of modernism"", which views the rationalistic development of Western culture since the Enlightenment as a descent into depravity. Eco distinguishes this from a rejection of superficial technological advancement, as many fascist regimes cite their industrial potency as proof of the vitality of their system.
""The Cult of Action for Action's Sake"", which dictates that action is of value in itself, and should be taken without intellectual reflection. This, says Eco, is connected with anti-intellectualism and irrationalism, and often manifests in attacks on modern culture and science.
""Disagreement Is Treason"" – Fascism devalues intellectual discourse and critical reasoning as barriers to action, as well as out of fear that such analysis will expose the contradictions embodied in a syncretistic faith.
""Fear of Difference"", which fascism seeks to exploit and exacerbate, often in the form of racism or an appeal against foreigners and immigrants.
""Appeal to a Frustrated Middle Class"", fearing economic pressure from the demands and aspirations of lower social groups.
""Obsession with a Plot"" and the hyping-up of an enemy threat. This often combines an appeal to xenophobia with a fear of disloyalty and sabotage from marginalized groups living within the society (such as the German elite's 'fear' of the 1930s Jewish populace's businesses and well-doings; see also anti-Semitism). Eco also cites Pat Robertson's book The New World Order as a prominent example of a plot obsession.
Fascist societies rhetorically cast their enemies as ""at the same time too strong and too weak."" On the one hand, fascists play up the power of certain disfavored elites to encourage in their followers a sense of grievance and humiliation. On the other hand, fascist leaders point to the decadence of those elites as proof of their ultimate feebleness in the face of an overwhelming popular will.
""Pacifism is Trafficking with the Enemy"" because ""Life is Permanent Warfare"" – there must always be an enemy to fight. Both fascist Germany under Hitler and Italy under Mussolini worked first to organize and clean up their respective countries and then build the war machines that they later intended to and did use, despite Germany being under restrictions of the Versailles treaty to NOT build a military force. This principle leads to a fundamental contradiction within fascism: the incompatibility of ultimate triumph with perpetual war.
""Contempt for the Weak"", which is uncomfortably married to a chauvinistic popular elitism, in which every member of society is superior to outsiders by virtue of belonging to the in-group. Eco sees in these attitudes the root of a deep tension in the fundamentally hierarchical structure of fascist polities, as they encourage leaders to despise their underlings, up to the ultimate Leader who holds the whole country in contempt for having allowed him to overtake it by force.
""Everybody is Educated to Become a Hero"", which leads to the embrace of a cult of death. As Eco observes, ""[t]he Ur-Fascist hero is impatient to die. In his impatience, he more frequently sends other people to death.""
""Machismo"", which sublimates the difficult work of permanent war and heroism into the sexual sphere. Fascists thus hold ""both disdain for women and intolerance and condemnation of nonstandard sexual habits, from chastity to homosexuality.""
""Selective Populism"" – The People, conceived monolithically, have a Common Will, distinct from and superior to the viewpoint of any individual. As no mass of people can ever be truly unanimous, the Leader holds himself out as the interpreter of the popular will (though truly he dictates it). Fascists use this concept to delegitimize democratic institutions they accuse of ""no longer represent[ing] the Voice of the People.""
""Newspeak"" – Fascism employs and promotes an impoverished vocabulary in order to limit critical reasoning.",,/r/europe/comments/dn2gaa/poll_of_polls_spanish_election_seat_projection/f595lfu/,grmmrnz,1572072050
5141,"Armor.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chobham_armour#Heavy_metal_modules

&gt;The armour configuration of the first western tanks using Chobham armour was optimised to defeat shaped charges as guided missiles were seen as the greatest threat. In the eighties however they began to face the improved Soviet 3BM-32, then 3BM-42 kinetic energy penetrators which the ceramic layer was not particularly effective against: the original ceramics had a resistance against penetrators of about a third compared to that against HEAT rounds; for the newest composites it is about one-tenth. A typical example, the 3BM-42 is a segmented projectile which frontal segments are sacrificed in expanding the NERA plates in the front of the armour array, leaving a hole for the rear segment to strike the ceramic with full efficiency. For this reason many modern designs include additional layers of heavy metals to add more density to the overall armour package.
&gt;
&gt;The introduction of more effective ceramic composite materials allows for a larger width of these metal layers within the armour shell: given a certain protection level provided by the composite matrix, it can be thinner. Because these metal layers are denser than the rest of the composite array, increasing their thickness requires reducing the armour thickness in non-critical areas of the vehicle.[13] They typically form an inner layer placed below the much more expensive matrix,[14] to prevent extensive damage to it should the metal layer strongly deform but not defeat a penetrator. They can also be used as the backing plate for the matrix itself, but this compromises the modularity and thus tactical adaptability of the armour system: ceramic and metal modules can then no longer be replaced independently. Furthermore, due to their extreme hardness, they deform insufficiently and would reflect too much of the impact energy, and in a too wide cone, to the ceramic tile, damaging it even further. Metals used include a tungsten alloy for the Challenger 2[15] or, in the case of the M1A1HA (Heavy Armor) and later American tank variants, a depleted uranium alloy.

Ammunition.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depleted_uranium#Ammunition

&gt;Most military use of depleted uranium has been as 30 mm ordnance, primarily the 30 mm PGU-14/B armour-piercing incendiary round from the GAU-8 Avenger cannon of the A-10 Thunderbolt II used by the United States Air Force. 25 mm DU rounds have been used in the M242 gun mounted on the U.S. Army's Bradley Fighting Vehicle and the Marine Corps's LAV-25.
&gt;
&gt;The U.S. Marine Corps uses DU in the 25 mm PGU-20 round fired by the GAU-12 Equalizer cannon of the AV-8B Harrier, and also in the 20 mm M197 gun mounted on AH-1 Cobra helicopter gunships. The United States Navy's Phalanx CIWS's M61 Vulcan Gatling gun used 20 mm armor-piercing penetrator rounds with discarding plastic sabots and a core made using depleted uranium, later changed to tungsten. 
&gt;
&gt;Another use of depleted uranium is in kinetic energy penetrators, anti-armor rounds such as the 120 mm sabot rounds fired from the British Challenger 1, Challenger 2,[34] M1A1 and M1A2 Abrams.[35] Kinetic energy penetrator rounds consist of a long, relatively thin penetrator surrounded by a discarding sabot. Staballoys are metal alloys of depleted uranium with a very small proportion of other metals, usually titanium or molybdenum. One formulation has a composition of 99.25% by mass of depleted uranium and 0.75% by mass of titanium. Staballoys are approximately 1.67 times as dense as lead and are designed for use in kinetic energy penetrator armor-piercing ammunition. The US Army uses DU in an alloy with around 3.5% titanium.
&gt;
&gt;Depleted uranium is favored for the penetrator because it is self-sharpening[36] and flammable.[32] On impact with a hard target, such as an armored vehicle, the nose of the rod fractures in such a way that it remains sharp.[36] The impact and subsequent release of heat energy causes it to ignite.[32] When a DU penetrator reaches the interior of an armored vehicle, it catches fire, often igniting ammunition and fuel, killing the crew and possibly causing the vehicle to explode. DU is used by the U.S. Army in 120 mm or 105 mm cannons employed on the M1 Abrams tank. The Russian military has used DU ammunition in tank main gun ammunition since the late 1970s, mostly for the 115 mm guns in the T-62 tank and the 125 mm guns in the T-64, T-72, T-80, and T-90 tanks.
&gt;
&gt;The DU content in various ammunition is 180 g in 20 mm projectiles, 200 g in 25 mm ones, 280 g in 30 mm, 3.5 kg in 105 mm, and 4.5 kg in 120 mm penetrators. DU was used during the mid-1990s in the U.S. to make hand grenades, and land mines, but those applications have been discontinued, according to Alliant Techsystems.[citation needed] The US Navy used DU in its 20 mm Phalanx CIWS guns, but switched in the late 1990s to armor-piercing tungsten.
&gt;
&gt;Only the US and the UK have acknowledged using DU weapons.[37] 782,414 DU rounds were fired during the 1991 war in Iraq, mostly by US forces.[38] According to an international legal team preparing a lawsuit against NATO, 10–15 tons of depleted uranium was used during the 1999 bombing of Yugoslavia.[39] In a three-week period of conflict in Iraq during 2003, it was estimated that over 1000 tons of depleted uranium munitions were used.[40] More than 300,000 DU rounds were fired during the 2003 war, the vast majority by US troops.[38]",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/dn57iz/germany_shipping_depleted_uranium_to_russia/f595lpd/,duisThias,1572072059

Yes.  Though this does happen in politics, and some of politics has to be dealing with that.

&gt; “David Cameron asked me not to intervene in the referendum campaign because he said the European Commission is even less popular on the islands than on the continent ... That was a major mistake: I should have intervened, because nobody was denying, contesting the lies Boris Johnson and others were spreading around.”

I suspect that David Cameron is more-in-touch with what works in British politics than Juncker.

Remember when Cameron asked Obama -- representing the US, who is a third party in this -- to come over and give a speech where he advised the UK to remain in the EU, and [wrote a article supporting Remain in *The Telegraph*](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/04/21/as-your-friend-let-me-tell-you-that-the-eu-makes-britain-even-gr/)?  I remember reading /r/ukpolitics around then.  He got called the most anti-British US President ever, people talked about him not having Churchill's bust in the Oval Office, etc.  And it does not seem to have helped Remain.

Juncker has proposed before that he could have personally convinced the British public if he had jumped in, and /r/ukpolitics was pretty dubious, and I kinda agree with them.  If Obama generated that much angry backlash and had that little effect, I am suspicious that Juncker would be even worse-placed to personally sell people who were in many cases specifically grouchy about *him*.

&gt; But the commission president denied that it was the EU’s fault that the campaign had been lost, instead pointing the finger at the British press, in which the prime minister once worked as a Brussels correspondent.

I don't think that it was so much Juncker's personal fault -- he came into office right when things were being lit on fire -- though I do think that if the EU didn't take into account long-run public image of the EU, maybe that represents a flawed structure in the EU.  Certainly the EU *monitored* public impression via Eurobarometer, considered it important, knew public positions, but nothing happened during those many years of press criticism.

&gt; He added that Brexit was “a shame” and would not serve the interests of either the UK or EU.

I suspect that he is correct.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/dn574k/eu_president_juncker_says_boris_johnson_lied/f58tind/,duisThias,1572063696

* a lot of people here seem to have kids without being married. There’s just less emphasis on the role of marriage in starting a family. The downside is - more single mothers.

I’m from the UK and out of my friends group (I’m 26) I don’t know anyone who has a kid.

I think it’s interesting, because it points to a lot of social and economic factors. People in the UK my age are a bit fucked right now - barely anyone can’t afford a house in their 20s, rent is expensive, the job market is in a bubble and actually far worse than it is so people are putting off having kids on the earlier side of things.

5203,"It's a combination of industrialism and agricultural innovations.

In an agrarian society population always depends on how much food can be grown. Typicly 90% of the population was involved in the growing of food and the vast majority of economic value created was agricultural. There were some exceptions (for example Rome during the roman era and some mining regions) where food imports could supply a slightly higher surplus population due to the wealth created by the mines but populations tended to be dependant on local food production.

Four things changed that. 1. The industrial revolution allowed for the industrial production of goods. Value that could be used to support food imports in greater numbers. 2. Innovations in drainage and plows allowed for previously low-productive areas with muddy soil to produce much more. 3. Synthetic fertilizers (first primarily from bat guano, then from fosfate mining) allowed for much greater harvests. 4. Innovations in infrastructure, such as trains and canalbuilding allowed for more effective transport. While previously it hadn't been economicly feasible to export grain from central Ukraine, Scania or from the plains around the great lakes it suddenly was.

Germany was in many ways in an ideal position to capitalize on these innovations, and by 1900 they had 50 million inhabitants, 20 million more than Italy. Italys starter advantage in having very fertile soils and a long growing season didn't matter as much anymore.

5210,"&gt;Serbia’s Defence Ministry is using this year’s Belgrade Book Fair to promote a book by a former Yugoslav Army general who was convicted of war crimes and host an event featuring two other war criminals.

&gt;The Serbian Defence Ministry organised an event at the Belgrade Book Fair on Friday to promote a new book by former senior Yugoslav Army officer Nebojsa Pavkovic, who is currently serving a prison sentence for war crimes in Kosovo.

&gt;It is also holding a debate at the Book Fair on Friday about the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, with participants including two other men who have been convicted of war crimes, Vladimir Lazarevic and Vinko Pandurevic.

&gt;The ministry said that it was “proud” to promote Pavkovic’s book and host the two other war criminals, arguing that “they have the right to express their views on the historic events in which they participated”, Beta news agency reported.

&gt;The Hague Tribunal ruled in January 2014 that Pavkovic and Lazarevic, along with former Yugoslav deputy prime minister Nikola Sainovic and former Serbian police general Sreten Lukic, were guilty of the murder, deportation and inhumane treatment of Kosovo Albanians in 1999.

&gt;Pavkovic is still serving his 22-year sentence in Finland.

5257,"The more controversial Salvini’s actions, the more Italians like him and his political philosophy, which has been labeled “sovranismo” (souverainism). It is essentially a strand of nationalism that opposes international organizations, which its adherents see as an obstacle to an individual nation’s power. Much like Trump’s, this ideology is carried forward through a hate of immigrants alongside a distrust of global institutions.

But the word sovranismo, a neologism that entered the common political discourse in the past couple of years, denotes something more radical than nationalism. It comes from the word sovrano, which means superior, as well as ruler, and speaks not just of the preservation and pride of a nation within itself, but of its superiority. Without getting into the nuances of political theory, it is easy for Italians to grasp the core notion of what sovranismo is about: the promise of Italian supremacy.

This is not new. It is similar to Benito Mussolini’s promise to return Italy to a long-lost moment of greatness and power. Bringing back the imagery and language of the Roman empire was key to the success of fascism. Even without open references to Rome, the idea that (white, Christian) Italians deserve to be superior—are superior—has a strong pull over Salvini’s many supporters.

&gt;Germany has all those things already. Spain is already poor and can’t afford to leave the EU because they need it even more. Beggars can’t be choosers. There’s no pain in the ass for Germany. Writing gigantic checks to subsidize Southern Europe would be a huge pain in the ass to Germany.

Those are fairly shit solutions in that they also impose costs on the sending state, but they *do* make it harder for people to leave.  My point is that as long as the system is structured such that members who are sources of migration get screwed for doing so, and members who are destinations of migration benefit, the EU creates misincentives to adopt such shit solutions.

The economically-efficient ideal is that the EU have a mobile labor force that can move to wherever it's required.  If that's in the EU's benefit, then the EU wants to structure things such that this is also in the benefit of EU members.

While the US and Canada do have a limited form of freedom of movement of labor in the form of NAFTA TN visas, they are much less-permissive than the situation in the EU, and the scale of population movement between the two is vastly smaller than within Canada or within the US.

5488,"&gt; Some of the porn peaces out there come close to raping. Especially young girls will get lured by promises of big money and then they get abused. 

You realize that the genre you're talking about the (""casting"" genre) are all scripted, right?

&gt; The harder the better as the more extreme something is the more clicks it generates.

You're gonna have to provide some numbers for that.  Things like BDSM are actually niche and the REALLY hard BDSM is even more niche.

&gt;Some time ago 50% of the internet links were connected to porn. Do you think every single actor (be it a female/male) is happy in the industry?

Another citation needed, here.

&gt; Do you think every single actor (be it a female/male) is happy in the industry?

In no industry in the world is every worker happy.

&gt;And I've watched recently a porn documentation were a group did sell a service to random guys. They were allowed to fuck with a ""porno actress"" and even take the video with them. The girls thought they would film a ""promotional video"" that would be shown to big companies (you will make 1000€ a day when they hire you, look this this and this porn star is made big by us). They couldn't speak the language and did get nothing (some even paid for it).

Name of the documentary?  This is exactly the plot of ""casting"" porn that is totally scripted.

&gt; Both (the guy and the girl) had to sign a adhesion contract and even with a lawyer couldn't do anything afterwards.

At least in the US, a contract cannot enforce something that is otherwise illegal.

&gt; It's easy to put the spotlight on the bride side of things but it's not a representation of the norm especially not for all 700 pron stars from the Czech Republic (and the way higher dark number).

And ""rock star"" careers aren't representative of the thousands of musicians who only make a few hundred on weekends.  Doesn't mean they're unhappy.",,/r/europe/comments/dmtdy9/pornstars_per_million_inhabitants_in_europe/f57qboj/,YT-Deliveries,1572041618

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_capitalism

&gt;The role of Dutch-speaking lands, especially present-day Flanders and the Netherlands (in particular modern-day North Holland and South Holland), in the history of capitalism has been a much discussed and researched subject.[26][27][28][29][30][31][32][33] Capitalism began to develop into its modern form during the Early Modern period in the Protestant countries of North-Western Europe, especially the Netherlands (Dutch Republic)[34][35][36][37][38][39] and England: traders in Amsterdam and London created the first chartered joint-stock companies driving up commerce and trade, and the first stock exchanges and banking and insurance institutions were established.[40][41][42][43][44] The world's earliest recorded speculative bubbles and stock market crashes occurred in 17th-century Holland. The Dutch Republic was also an early industrialized nation-state in its Golden Age. Seventeenth-century Dutch mechanical innovations such as wind-powered sawmills and Hollander beaters helped revolutionize shipbuilding[45][46] and paper industries. The Dutch also played a pioneering role in the rise of the capitalist world-system.[47] World-systems theorists (including Immanuel Wallerstein and Giovanni Arrighi) often consider the economic and financial supremacy of the 17th-century Dutch Republic[48] to be the first historical model of capitalist hegemony.[49][50][51][52][53][54][55]",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/dmurn0/norway_wealth_fund_hits_record_10_trillion_crowns/f57co1n/,duisThias,1572034347

You’re making retarded comparisons.

Lmao, what kind of fucked up logic is that. That’s not how free market works at all. Capital doesn’t give a crap about that kind of stuff - it doesn’t matter whether you’re Polish, German, black, white.. the only color that matters is green. You’re being some weird nationalistic protectionist. But the reality is, nationality doesn’t matter at all in the free market.

Word is that Boris Johnson and Emmanuel Macron have been talking and texting to agree a strategy for a short extension to force the pressure back on parliament once again.

&gt;  although Kosovo is a perfect subject for diversions, so I don't know.

Yeah that's one very strong reason why I don't think he wants relations to be resolved. Also his track record. Between sending Serbia is Kosovo trains and bribing/lobbying countries to un-recognise it, Vucic has   triggered Kosovo tariffs and in general made relations worse than before.     

There's also the question of why Russia supports him. Russia absolutely wants to stop countries from joining the EU. To this end they have invaded and torn apart countries to make them ineligible, supported coups, pitted nationalists from one country against the nationalists from their neighbours and so on. And what have they done in regards to Serbia? Nothing? Oh, but they have given Vucic, a quasi-dictator who supposedly wants to get Serbia in the EU, an Order of Friendship? Hmm...     


Well he has been very slow in implementing reforms, worsened relations with Kosovo and as far as I have seen has not used the media he has control of to promote the EU. In stead he promotes China and to a lesser extent Russia. His actions as well as the motivations I can think of do not point to him wanting to get Serbia in the EU.

It could mean all sorts of thing, not just blocking some EU statement on Chinese human right violations like Portugal or Hungary may do.

And if you want to complain about the attitudes of small EU members states towards China, maybe have a look at the big ones first. They were the ones enjoying that given their size, China always gave them strong political and economic attention. They profitted from that and continue to do so. They never provided any guidance and strong backing of confrontational policy towards China, hence indirectly encouraged smaller countries to try to take a slice of that cake too.
