You have to differentiate between spiritual believes and being dogmatic about your religion/worldview. And this is an especially worrysome case exactly because traditionalist islam is still  an oppressive culture for woman.

75,"[Relevant Article:](https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2018/07/elin-erssons-citizen-activism-comes-at-a-heavy-price/amp/?__twitter_impression=true)

&gt;	Last week, a 22-year old Swede called Elin Ersson made headlines around the world for her ‘citizen-activism’. Learning that a failed asylum seeker from Afghanistan was to be deported from her country, she bought a seat on the plane that was due to take him part of the way back home (as far as Turkey). Once she was on board the plane Ersson refused to sit down. Filming the whole thing on her mobile phone (natch) Ms Ersson insisted that to send the failed asylum-seeker to his home country would be consigning him to ‘death’ because Afghanistan is ‘hell’. After about 15 minutes of this Ms Ersson got her way. The Afghan migrant was taken off the flight. Some passengers applauded. Ms Ersson cried. And soon she was being lauded as the Millennials’ answer to Rosa Parks.

&gt;	The self-appointed leaders of the sisterhood were especially vocal. A writer at the website that used to be the Independent told us that Ms Ersson has shown us ‘how effective individual action can be.’ Britain’s Shadow Home Secretary, Diane Abbott, applauded the ‘brave action by this young student’. And Caroline Lucas MP – joint leader of Britain’s Green Party – tweeted out motivationally ‘If ever you think one person can’t make a difference, then watch this! Huge respect to Elin Ersson, a student at Gothenburg university, for – literally – standing up for what she believes in. A true inspiration.’

&gt;	Of course anyone with any knowledge of the facts could tell you that the real headline story here should have been ‘Sweden actually deports failed asylum-seeker’. In the last few years alone, Sweden has taken in around a hundred thousand people who the country itself recognises have no right to be there. For in 2015, Sweden, like Germany, opened up its borders to the world and only after the world had come did the Swedish authorities ask who in the world was there.

&gt; They barely lost men, but they had no strategic reserve

they had enough strategic reserve to launch an attack on stalingrad. nearly succeeded too. people forget the in the initial stages, the Germans wiped out 4 armies in the prelude to stalingrad.

&gt;It was by no means the deciding factor nor necessary.

sure, lets hear from Zhukov and Stalin.

directly from **Stalin**.

&gt;Without American production the United Nations [the Allies] could never have won the war.

from the memories of **Nikita Krushchev**

&gt;I would like to express my candid opinion about Stalin’s views on whether the Red Army and the Soviet Union could have coped with Nazi Germany and survived the war without aid from the United States and Britain. First, I would like to tell about some remarks Stalin made and repeated several times when we were ""discussing freely"" among ourselves. He stated bluntly that if the United States had not helped us, we would not have won the war. If we had had to fight Nazi Germany one on one, we could not have stood up against Germany's pressure, and we would have lost the war. No one ever discussed this subject officially, and I don't think Stalin left any written evidence of his opinion, but I will state here that several times in conversations with me he noted that these were the actual circumstances. He never made a special point of holding a conversation on the subject, but when we were engaged in some kind of relaxed conversation, going over international questions of the past and present, and when we would return to the subject of the path we had traveled during the war, that is what he said.

&gt;Today [1963] some say the Allies didn’t really help us… But listen, one cannot deny that the Americans shipped over to us material without which we could not have equipped our armies held in reserve or been able to continue the war.


here's a pretty good answer from askhistorians on how critical lend lease was.

https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3pa76y/i_often_hear_people_say_that_the_united_states/cw4yywc/

&gt;Soviets had superior (soviet made) tanks.

During the Battle of Moscow. Lend lease tanks from Britain represented 25-35% of the medium tanks. All those Soviet tanks? Produced with American steel and aluminium. Why are you ignoring the American contribution to  Kursk? By then lend lease was in full force.

&gt;American support was vital in ending the war by 1945, sure.

Heres Russian historian Boris Sokolov discussing it.

&gt;""On the whole the following conclusion can be drawn: that without these Western shipments under Lend-Lease the Soviet Union not only would not have been able to win the Great Patriotic War, it would not have been able even to oppose the German invaders, since it could not itself produce sufficient quantities of arms and military equipment or adequate supplies of fuel and ammunition. The Soviet authorities were well aware of this dependency on Lend-Lease. Thus, Stalin told Harry Hopkins [FDR's emissary to Moscow in July 1941] that the U.S.S.R. could not match Germany's might as an occupier of Europe and its resources. ""


People forget, but the Nazis occupied nearly all the important parts of Russia specifically their raw resources and grain baskets. They also had a vast portion of the population in occupied territory. Also their economy was going to tank without American support. Lend lease was 0% interest basically 95% write off. Free money. It significantly contributed to the mechanization of the Soviet army. Providing over 30% of the best Soviet trucks. 93% of the locomotives produced in WW2 used by the Soviets was lend lease.

Think, without USA there's no D-day possibility. Germany can shift many divisons from the West compared to history. No USA, Japan can put more pressure on the Soviets as well. Stalins biggest fear was a two front war. ",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/93f4gv/what_do_you_know_about_the_soviet_union/e3gj5c3/,historybuffamerican,1533189523

The US is quite unlikely to reverse a grant of political asylum for any reason, as it would damage its ability to extend asylum in the future.  IIRC, extending asylum to Gulen was controversial and heavily-debated in the US prior to happening, but once it happened, that was it.  Turkey isn't going to change the US position on the matter by using US citizens as hostages, as it would set a godawful precedent: the US has an extensive history of hardline positions against people holding US citizens hostage.

205,"The Warsaw Pact countries were not reliable allies. Soviets until 1968 were not stationed in Czechoslovakia, thus they were depended on East German territory to stage an attack on West Germany. Around 1961, Khrushchev approached the Czechoslovak president Novotny with an idea that they should host Soviet bases with nuclear warheads, which was immediately rejected by the Czechoslovaks. Novotny argued with the Soviets, that in case of war with the West, Czechoslovak army would operate along side with the Red Army using Soviet advisors, but will not allow Soviets to be stationed there permanently. Khrushchev and later Brezhnev pressured Novotny several times, but were not successful. It is estimated that the Soviets planned invasion of Czechoslovakia as early as 1966 and replace Novotny with Soviet groomed Dubcek (he lived in USSR for many years). When Warsaw Pact invaded Czechoslovakia, they could establish bases in Bohemia just across Bavaria. However, it was very clear that neither Czechoslovak, Hungarian, or Romanian armies are eager to fight on the behalf of the USSR while Albania withdrew from the pact. Also, Yugoslavia was a military headache for the Warsaw Pact because 1968 gave Tito a reason to prepare for a war with the Warsaw Pact and thus preventing a repeating Prague or Budapest scenario.

228,"&gt;I disagree, especially for Germany. Calling the CDU ""right"", when it has given up almost all of its former right-Wing positions in the last years towards a (former) left-Wing stance, is simply wrong, imo. 

Name one.


&gt;At least in Germany, a lot of what is called ""far right"" today was dead center CDU 10-15 years ago. Today's AfD would have not raised any eyebrows in this past CDU.

Schimpff raised a lot of eyebrows 15 years ago, even in his own party, and he's not even close to the afd

-Sit down immediately if you feel dizzy or like you are about to throw up. It hits you faster and stronger than you think. 

-If you‘re outdoors for a long amount of time don‘t just rely on the water you drank half an hour ago. Always have at least one bottle of water in your hand so you can sip from it at least once every minute or two. 
- If possible get one of these handheld mini-ventilators that run on batteries and can be carried around. I know it looks ridiculous to hold them in public but they literally saved me from passing out a third time.

267,"This is a lot less exciting than it sounds — the title is quite clickbaity, as it strongly implies that the UK has elevated sharia law to having some form of legal status.

It's saying that if you get married in an Islamic ceremony but don't have a civil ceremony done, the UK will still treat you as being married.  Some woman was trying to divorce (and, I assume, obtain some chunk of shared assets) and the guy was saying that they weren't married in the eyes of the UK, so she couldn't, and the British court system said that they were, in fact, married, so she could.

This article doesn't give the legal details, but my guess is that the court made the unsurprising ruling that an Islamic ceremony and marriage met the requirements of a common-law marriage, and thus that this was a form of *common-law* marriage, an institution that exists in the ex-British Empire:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common-law_marriage

&gt;Common-law marriage, also known as *sui iuris* marriage, informal marriage, marriage by habit and repute, or marriage in fact, is a legal framework in a limited number of jurisdictions where a couple is legally considered married, without that couple having formally registered their relation as a civil or religious marriage. The original concept of a ""common-law marriage"" is a marriage that is considered valid by both partners, but has not been formally recorded with a state or religious registry, or celebrated in a formal religious service. In effect, the act of the couple representing themselves to others as being married, and organizing their relation as if they were married, acts as the evidence that they are married. 

This is probably good for Islamic women married to wealthy Islamic men living in the UK, since they enjoy a more-favorable legal position.  Suddenly, the woman who married Prince Someone-or-other can dig up a divorce lawyer and soak him for a substantial chunk of his net wealth.  Not so good for wealthy Islamic men, though.

EDIT: I take back the specifics — hadn't bothered to read the details, and had assumed that England *was* one of the places where common law marriage existed.  According to Wikipedia, it is *not*, aside from some specific exception related to American soldiers.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-42134722

&gt;Millions of unmarried couples who live together could be unaware of their rights if the relationship breaks down, a family law group has warned.
&gt;
&gt;Resolution carried out a survey which found two-thirds of cohabiting couples wrongly believe ""common-law marriage"" laws exist when dividing up finances.
&gt;
&gt;The number of unmarried couples living together has more than doubled from 1.5 million in 1996 to 3.3 million in 2017.
&gt;
&gt;Resolution chairman Nigel Shepherd said current laws were ""behind the times"".

Huh.

Well, it's still going to be largely a matter of legal detail as to what counts as legally committing to regular old civil British marriage, rather than some sort of elevation of sharia law to the status of British law.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/93umhm/british_court_recognises_sharia_law_in_landmark/e3g7exl/,vokegaf,1533174089

340,"&gt; So pretty much just the Gulf War? Other than that a couple of drones in 5 years, what an ""extensive combat service"" for an anti-missiles system.

Gulf war, Iraq war, Israel, Saudi with Yemen. I don't think you can point to any other active system of that category with comparable service except Russia's S-400.

&gt; If this is a successful story you are brainwashed. And again many says that their actual success rate is close to 0.I have linked you many sources, you give me a wikipedia list that actually proves my point. Funny, I will never understand how reddit works.

Dude, you cited a blogger from Foreign Policy. I'm simply asking you to provide me with *countries who have done better*, and you haven't been able to do so.

&gt; Again, that's not the point.

It kind of is the point. If France and Italy are having a high success rate in combat and other nations are buying their equipment in mass compared to US technology you'd have a point. Instead you are using an armchair persona claiming how bad US technology is when Italy/France haven't even fully modernized their anti-ballistic systems and they haven't even seen combat service, nor do we have any good record of their controlled trials.

&gt; The experience that required even a Congressional hearing on their failure rate? And why SA has to blatantly lie on their success if they ""work""? The problem is that actual combat experience has proven that they don't really work, I don't know why I am being downed for saying what is obvious and backed up by multiple sources.

Again, I don't know why you are saying they don't really work. Israel [just recently](https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/syria/israel-shoots-down-syrian-fighter-jet-penetrating-israeli-airspace-1.6311928) shot down a syrian fighter with this system.

&gt; Sure, of course they ""get pissed off""...

416,"&gt;	Probably because you are making undue assumptions.

I am not making any assumptions, I have linked an article that questions the validity of the Patriot System.


There is little evidence to prove that the Patriot hit more than a few Scud missiles launched by Iraq during the Gulf War,” a summary of the investigations concluded dryly, “and there are some doubts about even these engagements.”

&gt;	Intercepting a ballistic missile is very hard, something like a 50% success rate is fairly good.

The 50% estimate is form the US itself, they might be a little biased . Considering they started saying it was 95%, then 50% and then saying they were very confident of 25%.

From 95% to 25%... and they were old SCUD missiles.

And again in Saudi Arabia it seems it’s 0%, while of course Saudi Arabia said it was 100%. 

&gt;	The PATRIOT system has had extensive combat service from a variety of nations

No not really, the extensive combat service was basically only the Gulf war. And again 50% (or more probably  25% or less) is not that great, considering that Trump boasts a 97%....

&gt;	I don't know of any European equivalent with that much combat experience or success rate. Has the Italian/French system seen combat service?

I wasn’t saying others do better, just that the Patriot is quite shit and surely not as good as advertised. 

I mean the point maybe is: does Sweden need to buy this very expensive shit? I don’t think Russians are going to be scared by something that has probably a chance of success ranging from 0 to 50%.

450,"Disclaimer: I know how this reads, like capitalist propaganda and sure, I know I'm biased a fuck. There are many, deep issues with capitalism, social capitalism in the EU to be more specific but fuck me if anyone asserts that the two are even comparable. 

The whole devolving economic system, it's just fascinating. Food shortages, lack of supply of goods and services. Political trials, lack of freedom of speech. But like, not hate speech. Just speech. 

In the satellite states women have joined the labor force early to create two income households. Not as a societal achievement of equality but because they had to work too, to be able afford to raise a family. Ironically, in some of those countries it led to higher standards of social equality in comparison to the West. Clearly not talking about Russia but central Europe. What it meant though was that everyone was equally fucked. 

It was so unbelievably dysfunctional, it reminds me of today's state of journalism. The internet came and raped it so hard that we're all still sitting in the corner of the shower trying to make sense of it.

From absurd bureaucracy to the overt spying on citizens so they don't leave the country but everything is so fucking peaches and cream so why would you want to leave the socialist utopia we're all living in? Ah, you must be a spy from the west who wants to drag us down and destroy what we've built(lol, Stalin monuments, anyone?).

The more east you went the worse it got. Yugoslavia had it ""ok"", until the crazy fuck Tito died. We all know what the happened there in the 90s though.

I talked to everyone I know who is at least a generation older and had lived through much more of it. The common thread is that freedom is a great and an expensive luxury. Also that there's a different perception of the resilience of a democratic system in comparison to western societies. There's much more cynicism about the extreme pressures a democracy can withstand.

Then there's the means of production seizing idea. In practice, the government took all ownership of the land you had previously owned and said fuck you buddy. You work for the people now. 

Oh and pay us a part of whatever the fuck you make every month or you just might find yourself not to be able to do what you've been doing until now. Refuse to do that? You're fucked already. Like, the fucking nazis weren't this fucked up in some more remote parts of Eastern Europe during the second war. 

If you joined the party (communist party) then we might just let you work. Oh but by the way (hihi) being unemployed is illegal and we won't employ you cause your stupid ass wasn't cooperating by wanting to share enough (there's a difference between that and collaborating, see them STASI cunts et al.). In practice this would often mean to lie and hide some produce to be able to make it through the winter. 

Anyway, in some scenarios, you're not cooperating enough? To jail you fucking go. Are you a Roma (Gipsy) person, well we've got shortcuts for you. Did I mention it was illegal to not work? Right. In prison you were forced to do basically slave labor. Building crooked ass rabbit cage type housing for the proletariat. Or work in mines. Because fuck you that's why.

&amp;nbsp;

Here are some things we can consider though:

* Erdoğan's offer to release the pastor in exchange for the U.S. extraditing a political dissident.

* How the prosecution's charges rely on statements by unidentified supposed witnesses.

* That one piece of 'evidence' that Branson is a member of a terrorist organization is video of food... because a lot of people in that terrorist organization enjoy that kind of food.

* The trial has barely proceeded despite almost 2 years passing.

* The indictment includes blatant falsehoods, such as that a single organization directs *all* Christian churches, the CIA/FBI/NSA are known as 'the Mormon Gang' in the U.S., and that Christianity is inherently a threat to the Turkish nation, despite Turkey being a secular country.

&amp;nbsp;

All in all, that makes it look like the case against Branson is *extremely* flimsy, and this is yet another incident of Erdoğan's government abusing the Turkish justice system.

534,"The rail networks in th US and the UK worked very well for the time they were built. Back then the rail industry had a monopoly on fast travel so it had a lot more money coming in so many operators had enough money to build their own rail networks that allowed for competition between network operators for thw business from the train operators. This allowed for a very efficient train network.

This all changed in WW1 when the train networks were nationalized to allow for cost saving  while also providing priority to minitary cargo trains (before it was so that if the someone wanted priority for their cargo they had to pay extra, like in any business model). The idea was that theyd nationalize the firms employees making them state workers which allowed them to cut out the price difference that came from the companies need for profit, thus decreasing cost. This works in the short term as the culture of high productivity and need for innovation deteriorates in the long term because of the lack of competition. Later after WW2 when the US and the UK (a little less for the UK) decided to privatize the market again, the weakened, uncompetitive and old train network was released back into the private sector at the same time as automobiles were comming out and getting affordable for the average consumer; those factors combined allowed for the auto industry to be more competitive and thus dominate the market, killing train operators.

Nowadays with all transport options being in competition makes private rail lines unrealistic because the upfront costs would be too high and the prices they would later have to charge would render them uncompetitive against other transport options like the car.

I agree that the actual rail *networks* should be in public hands but i would say that the train operators should be private because competition would allow for better conditions for consumers. The government would also have to ensure network operator efficiency by out-sourcing the service of traffic managment to private firms (kinda like theyre the consumer).

Tdlr: IMO the government should be a service taker and not an operator themselves.",Armenion citizen,/r/europe/comments/93mnom/germanys_china_city_how_duisburg_became_xi/e3fh0nc/,Maakolo,1533150242

&gt;Educate (in schools, social centres etc.), give flyers, blue line etc., shelters if they end without living. Tell these women that if they are victims, state will **help** them.

Totally agree. We should heavily invest in education and support. But no reasonable amount of support might be enough... consider:

&gt;""If you are doing it on your own, fine. If not, we will help you"".

Consider that even women that are punched in the face and raped, hesitate to seek help.

Consider that, since being forced to wear some clothes is not that bad, therefore they will essentially never leave their families and their whole live support in favor of living a very poor live of being alone and living on just a miserable government support. It's just an easy decision to make. Yes, they would prefer to have the freedom to not wear burqas and hijabs. Yes, they would like to be free to talk to whoever they want, to date, to make friends with people outside of the Islamic community.

638,"First, I think it’s shaky as a means to ban niqabs, as the law excludes worthy purposes, which according to our constitution includes religion. It’s arguable, but the fact that it’s arguable is problematic.

Second, I find it contradictory. To prevent women from being told what to wear, we are telling them what to wear. I understand not tolerating intolerance, but fighting fire with fire like this doesn’t sit well with me. 

Third, I think it’s treating a symptom. Like putting a bandaid on it and pretending that fixes anything, while the problem is much deeper. I am convinced thee must be other ways to handle this issue.

Fourth, I don’t like living in a country that tells me what to wear or not to wear. I’m okay with some exceptions like exposing yourself to others and hanging around a bank with ski mask, but those should be just that, exceptions. A few weeks ago it was not a problem for me to cover my mouth with my scarf when biking to keep from swallowing insects. Now I live in a country where I need to trust that the police agrees with me that this is a worthy purpose.

Fifth, the most common reason I see given by supporters I’ve talked with is that they get nervous when they see women wearing niqabs. The same argument has been made for banning beards on Muslim looking persons in hospitals. I don’t think that this should be a basis for law making.

Sixth, I really don’t like how this law came about. The way this law is written, it is not a niqab ban (because that would be against our constitutional freedom of religion), but a general ban that just happens to include basically only niqabs. It is blindingly obvious to everyone that this is a circumvention meant to target niqabs, and I don’t like that. I have a great deal of respect for the constitution, both in word and in spirit, and I think this violates the spirit, if not the word.

This is all fairly subjective, and I’ll change my opinion in light of new information, but these are my reasons at the moment for opposing this law.",,/r/europe/comments/93ne8z/danish_burqa_ban_comes_into_effect_amid_protests/e3f81fz/,zeldn,1533143148

677,"I have my reservations around China's Belt and Road project, and their aspirations for becoming a superpower. 

They have a massive demographic problem they'll be running into over these next few decades, as the working population shrinks and the elderly population grows. Newer, smaller generations won't be able to support such a massive population. There are also many more men than women in China. Not only that, but the two groups have been effectively segregated between administrative divisions.

Investment is also starting to move away from China and towards other countries. The minimum wage there has increased during its economic boom, hurting a lot of companies that moved production there to curb labor costs. We're already starting to see GDP growth begin to slow, and their government might still be buffing the figures.

They're also drowning in debt. A lot of money was dumped into these amazing, large-scale infrastructure projects meant to increase production and efficiency. Because of the nature of their economy, they're having a lot of issues to settle these debts.

China is also too reliant on global maritime trade. This is why they're expanding their navy and trying to build this Silk Road II. Virtually all of their oil from the Middle East passes through Indonesia. Any country that can effectively blockade that point puts China in a kind of choke-hold. This is why they're imperialistic regard the South China Sea, because if the US or Japan can hold the region, they can dominate the Chinese economy.

All of that, topped off with an oppressive communist government, growing ethnic tensions between regions, practical occupations in Tibet and Manchuria, and an authoritarian leader. Is that superpower material?

Dying as a lumberjack is just an accident, unfortunate as it may be, it wasn't done in the name of your country or it's people. It was done for work. 


Perhaps it's because of what they're dying for. As a to be electrician, if I were to die due to an electric accident, I won't be dying in the name of Sweden or it's people. I'll be number, a statistic of electrical accidents in the current year. Whereas those who die in the military explicitly do it in service of their country. 


I don't think we can equate the death of a soldier to the death of a Lumberjack or electrician. One is an accident (or result of stupidity) &amp; the other is the result of you fighting the countries enemy who's intent is to kill you. 


Furthermore: The way they die. As an electrician getting 3 amps in you isn't nearly as terrifying as getting nailed by a mortar, or having your HUMMVE drive on a mine.

774,"Not sure that's the case right now.

Essentially we have two parties who are both split on what to do about brexit.

The Eurosceptics in both parties want us to leave but for different reasons.

In the Tory governing party these are mostly backbench ministers with no direct power but are strong enough to be influencing policy and threaten the PM. They want to withdraw from the EU for mostly sovereignty reasons and not be dictated to by Brussels. However brexit, especially a hard brexit is not favoured by business and the governing party is, in normal circumstances, very much pro business. May, the PM, is not in favour of a hard Brexit bit is trying to get as good a deal as possible.

The Labour party in opposition is similarly split. The remainers want as soft a brexit as possible to safeguard jobs or ideally have a second referendum to call brexit off entirely. However Corbyn, the leader of the opposition, would probably prefer us to leave the EU so he can enact protectionist measures to boost industry in the UK regions where the Labour party traditionally draws a lot of support. The issue is compounded by the fact that they are not being clear on what policy they have on brexit. Right now to make matters worse the opposition is also mired in a huge anti-Semitism scandal and are doing a terrible job managing it.

Tl;dr this isn't a two party issue. Brexit isn't split along party lines. Both left and right want to leave for wildly different reasons.",,/r/europe/comments/93nkk7/boris_johnson_emerges_as_favourite_to_replace/e3eza2v/,Sturmgheist,1533136238

848,"Essentially everything you say is taken straight out of the revisionist propaganda that aims to wrap a narrative around cherry-picked facts. The goal is to mythologize the pre-war Polish military and authorities and reverse anything that cane be construed as factual from the communist side, even if it is correct.

I did not accuse you of being a nationalist-populist revisionist but now I do have suspicions that you have an agenda because of how and what you say.

My grandfather's brother was in the Home Army. He told us how absolutely and utterly unprepared and badly managed the structures were and how there was a very strong drive toward the uprising among portion of the command in Poland. Not just the soldiers. The commanders. 

There were plenty of things they could do to stop the uprising or at least successfully de-fuse it if they wanted it.  It doesn't take a lot especially if many of them are kids. But the command in Poland *didn't*. They wanted the uprising and they only complained that the allies weren't willing to sacrifice everything to help them. When it started they still thought that through fait accompli they would force action on the allies.

Some people did oppose it and went along only when it was obvious that the rest did all they could to start it. But that's not the same as blaming the masses and taking all the responsibility from the command. That's precisely the propaganda I am talking about.

Also it was interesting to see who veterans of WW2 were making up their stories over time. They said one thing in the 50s, another in the 70s, another in the 90s. And depending on where they stood politically after 1991 their stories changed. Sometimes overnight. My family served both in the east, in the country and in the west. I got enough perspectives. 

&gt;Look I went to ""Batalion Zośka"" gymnasium and ""Powstańcy Warszawy"" high school before I studied history at Warsaw University.

I went to an elementary school that was named after one of the commanders of the communist forces. So what? Every government has its own propaganda that it will push to legitimize itself and delegitimize its predecessors.

The problem is that you bark it out mindlessly and don't see the problems I am trying to point out. One of which is that it is a propagandized version of history that is glorifying a dreadful mistake that the pre-war government had a hand in.

It's all political. It's all for contemporary politics' sake

&gt;Was allied planes allowed to land on soviet airfields?

*were 
*Soviet

If this is how you were taught English in ""Batalion Zośka"" gymnasium ad ""Powstańcy Warszawy"" high school then I wouldn't brag about your knowledge of history. It might be just as bad.

No they weren't.  Because if they were Soviets would have to divert precious service time and fuel. I think that for all the great history that you were taught in your wonderful schools nobody told you who did what during WW2. Because then you might actually learn about materiel shortages in the Red Army and how despite having all the natural resources at their disposals fuel and raw materials still were coming from America in convoys.  How do you think that would work? Planes would have to first carry service crews across the frontlines so that the regular airlift and bombing runs would have proper service. And what would they achieve? Soviets would not give them their weapons. They would have to carry payload from Britain. At the same time there was intense fighting on the Western Front. Even if Stalin was an actual Good Uncle Joe nobody would throw away precious resources to help in an operation that had a chance of success smaller than some theoretical victory in 1939.

You are confusing a political charade which the allies played against each other  - including the drops - with actual possible military assistance.  The Allies and Stalin fought for control of Poland and both sides used their Poles instrumentally. But every now and then when you use someone else's soldiers they do something you don't want them to do.

That's what happened in Warsaw. That's what happened with the soldiers from the 1st Army who crossed Vistula.
Both acted against the orders and recommendations of their respective command.

1041,"That's not what I'm saying. You're saying Poles are moving back. That's only the case for a minority. More Poles are moving towards the Netherlands than Poles moving back. That's my main point. 

And what you're bringing up now - that's a whole different discussion. Poles and other Eastern Europeans do cause quite some problems. A few weeks ago the supermarket where my boyfriend works got attacked by a group of drunk Poles and a week ago there was a knife attack by a Latvian about 2 km from where I live. Poles aren't allowed in many nightclubs because the security knows 'they will almost certainly cause problems'. Yesterday I almost got run over by a bus with a Polish car plate. Looking away from problems Polish immigrants cause is not a bright idea. It's the same as in the 90s with muslims. Some politicians do talk about it in the open, e.g. Geert Wilders who launched a 'Poles checkpoint' where you can report misbehaviours committed specifically by Poles. Discriminatory, yes, but most Poles would support such a thing if it were done for Muslims, no? Looking away from these problems is exactly what caused Brexit. Nobody in the EU even thought of it negatively before the borders were opened for nearly a hundred million people from 13 poor Eastern European countries. 

I don't see any adaption or assimilation either, only for the kids. Almost all Poles speak no Dutch, even those working in their 'sklep' (why Poles need a seperate supermarket just for themselves is beyond me) and many of them just drink all day with their other Polish friends.

Regarding it being ""Soros bullshit"", I urge you to dig deeper. What the foundation is doing in Eastern Europe, is far from bullshit. Sure, they have charitable causes, such as helping students to get education, but that's a common tactic. If you want to expand your operations, own a foundation, run a few charities and over time you will have enough political capital to influence decisions. This is what's happening in Eastern Europe.

At the end of the day, like it or not, it's all about the ideology of the majority. Right now people are getting more nationalistic by the day. There will be a clash and news articles/opinion pieces such as this one are to be expected.

If you have the time, please go though my posts. I've written a few where I outline common tactics in propaganda.

The one just mentioned which Euclid and Ptolemy supported and the intromission theory supported by Aristotle. Ibn Haytham combined those with Galens anatomy of the eye to create the most accurate theory regarding light at the time. 

Euclid did provide a theorem for cosines but his theorem was proven through geometry. If you read the rest of the wiki page you would have read the bit where he didn't prove it through trigonometry and algebra. You would also read the bit which says that it was Al-Kashi who discovered the law of cosines. And yes he based his ideas of Euclids but that's how science works. We build upon others ideas. Euclids ideas already existed and were already proven before him, but he presented them in a logically coherent manner with mathematical proofs, which is why we attribute those works to him. It's why we also attribute the law of cosines to Al-Kashi.

This is something I already said. I said that the EU has a regulation that says an asylum seeker cannot seek asylum of his application has already been rejected by another EU country. However, I also stated that it doesn't say they must apply for asylum in the first safe country. Your source also doesn't say that. 

This is the issue I mentioned at the beginning of my previous comment. People talk about the Dublin regulation but don't actually know what it says.

1323,"Lol.. Muslim 'thinkers' were often silenced. You accrediting them to the Muslim faith, is rediculous.

The arab world had a lot more contributions, before mohammed when it was polytheistic and not governed by a single truth.

Like I mentioned.. Numbers themselves are ARABIC.

Here is a piece on why the arabic world TURNED AWAY FROM SCIENCE:

&gt; Contemporary Islam is not known for its engagement in the modern scientific project. But it is heir to a legendary “Golden Age” of Arabic science frequently invoked by commentators hoping to make Muslims and Westerners more respectful and understanding of each other. 

Again... Islam put chains, on what was a GOLDEN AGE. Islam, slowly worked its way into scientific progression and MUTED it. From a blossoming place.

&gt; To anyone familiar with this Golden Age, roughly spanning the eighth through the thirteenth centuries a.d., the disparity between the intellectual achievements of the Middle East then and now — particularly relative to the rest of the world — is staggering indeed.

____________________________________
&gt; Today, however, the spirit of science in the Muslim world is as dry as the desert. Pakistani physicist Pervez Amirali Hoodbhoy laid out the grim statistics in a 2007 Physics Today article: Muslim countries have nine scientists, engineers, and technicians per thousand people, compared with a world average of forty-one. In these nations, there are approximately 1,800 universities, but only 312 of those universities have scholars who have published journal articles. Of the fifty most-published of these universities, twenty-six are in Turkey, nine are in Iran, three each are in Malaysia and Egypt, Pakistan has two, and Uganda, the U.A.E., Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Kuwait, Jordan, and Azerbaijan each have one.
______________________________________
&gt; There are roughly 1.6 billion Muslims in the world, but only two scientists from Muslim countries have won Nobel Prizes in science (one for physics in 1979, the other for chemistry in 1999). Forty-six Muslim countries combined contribute just 1 percent of the world’s scientific literature; Spain and India each contribute more of the world’s scientific literature than those countries taken together. In fact, although Spain is hardly an intellectual superpower, it translates more books in a single year than the entire Arab world has in the past thousand years. “Though there are talented scientists of Muslim origin working productively in the West,” Nobel laureate physicist Steven Weinberg has observed, “for forty years I have not seen a single paper by a physicist or astronomer working in a Muslim country that was worth reading.”
_________________________________________
&gt; Comparative metrics on the Arab world tell the same story. Arabs comprise 5 percent of the world’s population, but publish just 1.1 percent of its books, according to the U.N.’s 2003 Arab Human Development Report. Between 1980 and 2000, Korea granted 16,328 patents, while nine Arab countries, including Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the U.A.E., granted a combined total of only 370, many of them registered by foreigners. A study in 1989 found that in one year, the United States published 10,481 scientific papers that were frequently cited, while the entire Arab world published only four. This may sound like the punch line of a bad joke, but when Nature magazine published a sketch of science in the Arab world in 2002, its reporter identified just three scientific areas in which Islamic countries excel: desalination, falconry, and camel reproduction. The recent push to establish new research and science institutions in the Arab world — described in these pages by Waleed Al-Shobakky (see “Petrodollar Science,” Fall 2008) — clearly still has a long way to go.

But christians all the times, like to cut out the pieces they dont like and claim Jesus, preached compassion. Fundamentally they are somewhat wrong.. But again.. The bible is not well written, and they do as they like. 

The Quran is however the ACTUAL word of allah. It is more militant. Fundamentalism will always exist. It takes a lot of verbal gymnastics to try convince people away from the extremist message.

We need the proper economic environment, and the proper culture. We don't want to live a society that is wealthy but dying off, nor do we want to live in a society that is expanding in population but impoverished and miserable.

It'll happen one way or another. Either liberal-minded people will return to their roots and rediscover family values, or they won't have children and their family lines will die off and be replaced by more conservative family lines. There are still segments of Western populations who are pious Christians, who choose to separate themselves from modern culture, who believe in being fruitful and multiplying!

&gt;How do you that without coercing people?

By doing what we're doing right now, talking about it! Spread the word!

&gt;This is getting too authoritarian for my liking.

The power to influence culture exists whether we like it or not. It's a question of who possesses that power. Should it be people who promote hedonism and criminality? Or should it be people who promote virtue?

&gt;Have a nice day, fellow human.

""Human"" is a meaningless designation if you're not talking about medicine or biology. There are all sorts of different humans who think, feel and do all sorts of different things.

1485,"Francisco Franco ran Spain with an iron fist for decades—and created myths about his rule that are only now starting to come undone.


Last month, within days of taking office, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez announced his government’s intention to exhume the remains of Francisco Franco, the strongman who ruled Spain from the end of the Spanish Civil War in 1939 until his death of natural causes in 1975. Expected to take place before the end of the summer, the exhumation plan calls for transferring Franco’s remains to a location yet to be determined. Just as controversial is Sánchez’s proposal to transform the remains’ current resting place, the Valle de los Caídos (the Valley of the Fallen), into a memorial for the victims of the Civil War and Franco’s dictatorship.


El Valle, one of Europe’s largest and most imposing public monuments (the entire complex, often derided for its fascist theatricality, includes a basilica, a Benedictine abbey, and a cross rising some 500 feet that is visible from over 30 miles away), was inaugurated by Franco himself in 1959 to mark the 20th anniversary of his victory in the Civil War. Virtually untouched since Franco’s embalmed body was interred there, the monument is a veritable shrine to Francoism and an obligatory pilgrimage for Franco’s defenders. In recent weeks, the most devout of these defenders have taken to the streets of Madrid chanting, “El Valle no se toca” (Don’t touch the valley).


To outside observers, the news of Franco’s exhumation and the controversy around it give rise to obvious questions: Why was Franco spared the popular infamy at home accorded to fellow fascist leaders Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini? And why is the status quo about how Franco has been memorialized since his death getting upended now? Answering these questions requires delving into the peculiarities of how Spain became a democracy in the late 1970s and the unusual choices about the country’s dark and painful history made by the politicians and the public as part of the democratic transition.


Much about Franco’s fate, both materially and figuratively, in the period after his death is due to the fact that the transition to democracy in Spain left very little room for justice and accountability toward the old regime. Unlike its sister dictatorship in Portugal—the António de Oliveira Salazar regime—which was uprooted by a popular uprising, the Franco regime was reinvented from the inside out as a democracy by a process of political reform spearheaded by a young King Juan Carlos. Although the king had promised Franco to carry on with “Francoism without Franco,” after the death of the dictator—and responding to the popular clamoring for democracy—he went back on his word and put Spain on the path to democracy by calling for free elections in 1977.


The democratic reinvention of the Franco regime meant that the losing side of the Civil War—the Republicans, a mostly leftist coalition of liberals, communists, socialists, and anarchists that resisted Franco’s assault on the popularly elected Second Republic—never got the chance to make Franco pay for his political sins. In what historians have referred to as the “Spanish Holocaust,” as many as 200,000 political dissidents were executed by Franco’s militias; an additional 400,000 were imprisoned in jails and concentration camps established by Franco after the end of the Civil War, where many died of malnutrition and starvation. An unknown number of prisoners were forced into virtual slavery to aid in the postwar reconstruction effort, including building El Valle. Some 500,000 people fled Spain as political refugees.


As part of the political negotiations that allowed for a swift and orderly transition to democracy, politicians from across the ideological spectrum agreed to a “pact of forgetting” that was institutionalized with a broad amnesty law, enacted just before the 1977 elections. This was “amnesty for everyone” as one politician put it, since it included anyone who had ever committed a political offense prior to 1977. Despite bearing the brunt of Franco’s repression, the left was eager to support this pact. It helped conceal the left’s political sins, especially the so-called Red Terror, the wave of killings that left anywhere from 20,000 to 70,000 Francoist supporters dead, including some 2,000 clergy, many of them later beatified by the Pope as Civil War martyrs.


An important reason why the politicians were able to let bygones be bygones was the complicity of the public. At the heart of this complicity is the ambivalence that many Spaniards feel toward the Franco regime. Polling data gathered in 2008 by Madrid’s Center for Sociological Research, a government research center, showed that a majority of the public acknowledged that Franco did “both good and bad things.” This data also showed the public opposed to the prosecution of former Franco officials and lukewarm about a truth commission to assign responsibility for the Civil War. And no national organization demanding accountability against the old regime emerged until the movement for the recovery of the historical memory began to gain steam in the early 2000s.


Spanish society’s complicity in silencing the past did not develop in a vacuum. In the wake of Franco’s death, fears of another civil conflict and another dictatorship were widespread. Less apparent is the intense process of political socialization that the public endured under the dictatorship. The Franco regime encouraged silence about the Civil War, which accounts for why Spaniards who lived through the war have very few recollections of this event being discussed at home, in schools, or in the workplace. After the end of the Civil War, Franco and his allies also began to promote numerous myths about the war and the regime—aided by a vast propaganda machine, including press reports, films and documentaries, and school textbooks—that in the post-transition period have done wonders to discourage any revisiting of the past.


Among the popular myths of the Civil War is that of shared responsibility, which holds both sides of the conflict equally at fault. It conveniently overlooks the fact that in 1936, Franco overthrew a popularly elected government. Another popular myth is “collective madness,” which absurdly theorizes that Spaniards lost their minds and began killing each other for no logical reason. Yet another popular narrative is to blame foreign ideological influences, especially anarchism. In this view, Spain is cast as a victim of outside forces. Nothing, however, trumps the salvation theory, the view that Franco’s uprising in 1936 saved Spain from the chaos and violence of the Second Republic. This outrageously cynical reading of history ignores both the chaos and violence that Franco inflicted on Spain, and that whatever degree of peace Franco was able to bring to the country was purchased with the lives of close to 1 million people.


The salvation theory was boosted by the political stability that Spain enjoyed after 1959—after all those in opposition to Franco had been either killed or forced into exile—and by an economic “miracle” that began to unfold in the early 1960s and lifted millions of Spaniards from abject poverty to the ranks of the middle class. Paradoxically, this very success undermined the salvation theory by blurring the memory of the Civil War and the misery of the postwar years. Thus, by the 1960s, the notion of the Franco dictatorship as a modernizing regime was born, with socioeconomic progress as the regime’s new rationale for its existence. In the post-transition era, this last regime reinvention has allowed Franco’s defenders to claim that the dictatorship paved the way for the successful democracy that Spain is today.


It was not until 2007, with the enacting of the Historical Memory Law by the Socialist administration of José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, that the Civil War myths promoted by the Franco regime began to be seriously questioned. The law declared the Franco government illegitimate; called for the removal from public view of public monuments honoring the Franco regime, save for those with historical significance; provided financial compensation to those victimized by the Franco regime; restored Spanish citizenship to the Republican exile community; and created a center for the study of the Civil War in the city of Salamanca. Propelling the law was a new generation of Spaniards curious about the Civil War and no longer traumatized by the memories of the past, including Zapatero, the grandson of a military captain executed by a Francoist brigade for refusing to join the rebellion against the Republican government.",Catalan Republic,/r/europe/comments/93kshz/spains_dictator_is_dead_but_his_popularity_lives/e3e0bfv/,Toc_a_Somaten,1533089178

1515,"I never said the opposite. In fact, precisely because Spain unemployment is that high (above 10% almost permanently) since the end of the dictatorship and still has grown with such speed is why I saying that. 

The real problem with Spain in 2008 was not the unemployment itself but a perfect storm of events and circumstances. Including a SECOND recession in 2011-2013. That is why it was so devastating.

I don't think the events are aligning on the same way now, that is why I believe that Spain will carry on through the next crisis better than in 2008.

Why does everyone immediately jump to immigration? There is no reason that the Spanish government cannot subsidize Spaniards to get married, create a stable family environment, and have children of their own. This ""WE NEED WORKERS NOW THROW OPEN THE BORDERS NOW"" mentality needs to keel over and die already. The verdict has been out for years now: it's a bad idea.

Here's the solution to population decline in Western countries: stop prioritizing GDP growth over your own citizens' well-being! Make sure they actually have INCENTIVES to get married and raise children! Stop promoting this idea that life is just a big party, and it's all about riding one high into the next! It turns out that ""traditional values"" became values in the first place because they are... valuable. Because they form the basis for a stable society.

Anarchists believe the state is inherently bad since it has a monopoly on violence, hence they believe socialism should be implemented bottom up rather than top down, so through worker's councils, trade unions, communes etc. that cooperate with each other as confederations.

remember, that only means something if its in a per capita context.
if thats the case, well, thats great, and i applaud that.

&gt; The problem is(many times brought up here) that before 1945, no one would ever call Czechia, Hungary or Poland as Eastern Europe. This terms ignore 1000 years of history and focus only on last 50, identyfing us with Russians, which is not only wrong from a historical perspective, but also humilating.

then again, there really is no consensus on the precise area of EE i think.

i think there are multiple definitions as to what constitutes ''eastern europe''

either culturally, socially or geographically.
i think the west does view countries such as Poland as eastern simply because the culture/values seems foreign to say Belgians for example, and more on par with Russia or the Ukraine.
even if that may be false.

i think the mistake people make when they DO think about Europe is that they envision Amsterdam, Paris and London first and foremost.
that also reinforces the ''eastern europe'' stereotype i think.

you could very well argue that Poland is in the same position as Turkey somewhat, i think.

1654,"&gt;Soviet scientific output being heavily overestimated in popular consciousness is true. Why is saying something true uncalled, hostile and unreasonable?

Depends on the field. In space, hardly overestimated.

&gt; It's not a hard measurement of science output, but it can measure public consciousness that I believe most people would be extremely surprised to know the distribution of science Nobel prizes by countries. Here it is - were you surprised?

It's not a measurement of anything, and no I'm not surprised. See, apart from the western countries, nobody really cares for Nobel Prizes. And despite trying to be ""unbiased"" they are very biased in their selections, especially during the cold war.

I mean the amount of controversies involving the nobel prizes for physics for example is ridiculous. 

&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize_controversies#Physics

Not to mention that the amount of nobel prizes is no indication of scientific output of a country. It's not really an indication of anything at all.

For example 

&gt;The 2006 prize was won by John C. Mather and George F. Smoot (leaders of the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) satellite experiment) for ""discovery of the blackbody form and anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR).""

Which soviets did back in 1983, but no prize for them

&gt; However, in July 1983 an experiment[125] launched aboard the Prognoz 9[126] satellite, studied CMBR via a single frequency. In January 1992, Andrei A. Brukhanov presented a seminar at Sternberg Astronomical Institute in Moscow, where he first reported on the discovery.

1737,"&gt; Perhaps because, unlike Armenia, Ukraine is a country deeply divided between a pro-Russia East and a pro-EU West.

If it's as extreme as you state then President Yanukovych should not have agreed to EU AA nor the EEA customs union. It's interesting how you blame the EU for the EU-Ukraine AA but your criticism (or lack of) towards Russia for telling Ukraine to join the EEA customs union is telling.

&gt; Furthermore, you're conveniently disregarding the fact that the legitimately elected government was unconstitutionally ousted after the president expressed his willingness to join the Eurasian customs union.

No, after he fled the country and ignored the provisions of the Agreement on settlement of political crisis in Ukraine, a treaty which he signed.

&gt; Why did he flee?

Beats me he had signed Agreement on settlement of political crisis in Ukraine which means there would be new elections in the same year and restore the previous Ukrainian constitution. My guess is he knew Russia was going to annex Crimea and fled the country.

&gt; It looks like you have trouble with the law of cause and effect. 

That's because the decision to annex Crimea was made before President Yanukovych fled the country. In order words there is no law of cause and effect at play here.

&gt;  And, again, the annexation is not OK but the bloody coup is?

1745,"I partially agree with the sentiment. But this discussion tends to be almost infantile in nature, with everyone talking about a generic ""immigration from Africa"",  as if all immigration were alike, legal or illegal, and as if Africa were some big uniform continent where everything and everyone is the same. And that's ridiculous. Central African Republic, Libya, Cape Verde and Angola are all very different realities.  

Portugal has a very close relationship with the PALOPs (Portuguese Speaking African Countries). The Portuguese Minister of Foreign affairs went as far as referring to Angola and Portugal as [siamese twins](https://www.dn.pt/portugal/entrevista/interior/angola-e-portugal-sao-gemeos-siameses-nao-vale-a-pena-alguem-amuar-8623473.html), to describe how intertwined both countries are at all levels (social, cultural, economic...). 

The relationship between Portugal and the PALOPs is rather good. The social context of each country varies a lot, but in all of them there's large numbers of people whose integration is trivial, and it should be easy to define policies that facilitate mobility and sustainable legal migration. And indeed [mobility](https://www.rtp.pt/noticias/mundo/cplp-mobilidade-de-cidadaos-sobre-a-mesa-da-cimeira-de-cabo-verde_n1087923) was in fact one of main focus of the latest CPLP (Community of Portuguese Speaking Countries)  summit, and will be the focus of the new Presidency of the organisation.

1748,"&gt; I feel that your argument boils down to, 1. Ukraine should just accept Russian hegemony and control, due to proximity and Russia's interest - either with nice words if they work (trading energy and industrial goods) or with power. 2. Since the outcome is the same either way - heeding to Russia - Ukraine is no longer is in negotiating power. 3. Ukraine can never ever choose its own allies, trade associations and orientation, because it's lucky to be bordered by Russia, who is more powerful. Corollary, if Ukraine doesn't stand up for itself, then it can remain in neglect (as history shows); if it does, it'll be suppressed (as recent history shows). 

My point was that US is the one who fucks shit up in close proximity to Russia.

&gt; Meanwhile, for example, Germany and the Netherlands can share a border peacefully, despite Germany being larger and more powerful. They don't control the Netherlands and don't enforce conditions onto them that has unilateral benefit. If the Netherlands doesn't want to be in the NATO or in the EU, they can quit if they want, just as no tanks were sent to Britain after the Brexit vote. 

Germany is a bad example as after WWII everyone made sure that they will never be able to do anything to anyone. Brexit also a bad example as it will damage UK. No one will allow anyone to leave EU or NATO as it makes existence of this organizations less formidable and put them at the point of collapse. UK will never get the good deal for Brexit as EU will surely make example of punishing this who want to abandob their ship.

&gt; I wish that Russia, Belarus and Ukraine can be just normal countries, who (specifically Russia) get along with their neighbors. 

Then i guess Europe and US shouldn't supported pro-west revolutions that brought to power anti-russian nationalists in Ukraine. Belarus isn't independent country either.

&gt;  Western Europe is living proof that violence and coercion aren't the only means. 

Western  Europe use sanctions to beat the shit out of each other, not only that but you had war even in modern times in Yugoslavia and later Serbia. You continue to support military inteventions in Middle East for resources. You just moved from infight to invading not like you stoped violence.

&gt; I always have to laugh when someone's argument is that ""Russia feels threatened"". It's not a child, Russian people have strong personalities, they can't just feel threatened.  Think about what Baltic states can feel if you think that Russia, with dozens of times the population, thousand times the land, and infinite times the nukes ""feels threatened"". 

Europe have NATO and US as their ally, but still feels threatened by Russia who economically weaker than them. Why Russia shouldn't be feel threatned by millitary alliance that unite half of the continent and have super power as their ally? Because it have nukes? Anyone still believes that someone will use them if they were attacked? I'm pretty sure that you need to be brain dead that actually use them, because it would be mutal destruction and not a victory.

Baltic states propaganded by their own nationalistic elites to be afraid of Russia, Pentagon prints articles how Russia can conquer Baltic in 72 hours.

1779,"Machine learning directed towards extrapolation is one of the single best uses for it, especially with data sets that can be fed in containing minute by minute data spanning years upon years.

We use machine learning in VFX for example to make renders less noisy by training software using the same renders of a particular image with progressively less and less noise. As in, you do a 5 minute render, a 15 minute render, a 1 hour render, and finally a 10 hour render to train the algorithms for what patterns emerge in the 5/15/60 minute jobs and then what the final result should look like in the 600 minute job.

Weather is an identical problem. You can train the software by showing it 1 year ago, 1 month ago, 1 week ago, 1 day ago, and then what the final result ended up being at the 00:00 mark, with points between all of those that are only a few minutes apart.

However the biggest snag in all of this is that really you'd need to study the entire planet as a whole to get the most accurate training. In VFX, neighboring pixels have no effect on the end result of the pixel 10 units away from them, while in weather of course it's this massive swimming data set.

I think it's a bit of both but with a caveat: there's no conspiracy regarding the child free life as it would be too complex to implement much akin to the ""global Jewish cabal"" or whatever weird conspiracy is in fashion these days.

They tried being subsequently allied with Russia, it didn't work either. In the meantime, comparable East European states such as Poland and Romania have been succeeding, with consistent growth.

speeding law does not target any specific group explicitly - everyone gets speeding tickets.

I used to work in an industry (textiles) dying for very similar reason - there's factories, lucrative contracts and demand for the quality of work the companies established over decades... And the workforce is 55-65 year old on average. Without immigrants from either Ukraine or Belarus the industry will choke because: there's nobody to teach in the trade schools, little desire to go to them among youths and those that finish them - end up leaving the industry very quickly

And that's the real reason why I'm positively giggly about prospect of Brits having to confront what really happens to jobs like this in a country with 4% unemployment. The jobs don't magically start generating more value, the industry moves out and switches to importing.   

And I'm just happy that British nationalists have decided to bite the bullet and serve as example for other countries.   
**Because what you've said is true** - we have the same shitheads here, repeating same bullshit. My favourite example:. An acquaintance was recently lamenting that our town is being overrun by Ukrainians, taking jobs from hard working Poles, supposedly an effect of some German conspiracy.  Reality check: he's a Pole working in Germany for that same company Ukrainians come to work for here. And the only conspiracy relating to Ukrainians is so they don't catch on that they could be earning x2 the wage if they drove 200 km further, to Czechia. X4 if they drove 500 km further to Saxony.

Among those suicidals I count the most of the German and French politicians, a mod here and a few other posters.

What Europe CAN do is try to help with the Green Green Wall, but Africans themselves should be less suicidal. The current situation, despite the claims of idiots, is fully of the Africans own doing. You see a couple of countries whom thrive in Africa, but those generally kept the legacy of Western colonist powers by keeping an well-balanced political structure and taking the advice to heart on how to run a country. On the other hand, there are massive failures like Zimbabwe and South Africa, which have gone full racist by seeking to disown or even kill all white people, which are or are becoming complete failures. Then there are some which allowed dictators to seize power, but came back from it, and whom are somewhat recovering like Namibia.

2001,"Paywalled:

Imagine that Canada or Japan came to the EU with the following proposal: “We are very pleased with our free trade agreement. But we want to go further than eliminating tariffs. Let us remove any need for border checks on trade. To make this possible, we are prepared to join a customs union with you. And we will adopt all your rules and regulations on goods — including any future changes you make. We understand this means giving up some autonomy. You are bigger than us so it will be your rules and trade policy we follow. But having frictionless trade with you is worth some rule-taking. Will you accept ending border checks on goods traded with us in return?”

I am describing a fantasy. But if it were for real, how should the EU respond? That is what the leaders of Europe will soon have to determine in their negotiations with the UK.

Not before time, the British government has adopted a policy on Brexit. The fundamental idea of Prime Minister Theresa May’s Chequers white paper is to create an area within which goods circulate freely — as they do today — without any border checks. This is a bold ambition. It is also politically courageous. Whatever her former red lines, Mrs May is plainly now proposing a model of pooled sovereignty.

The white paper does not yet amount to what I have imagined above. The EU rightly insists that Britain’s “taking back control” over its affairs cannot mean EU members losing control over theirs. The question is whether some form of a free movement zone for goods can be found that respects this.

The answer is yes — provided some extra work is done to disarm possible threats to the “integrity” of the EU’s single market and legal order, which the bloc’s leaders have vowed to defend. Integrity, here, is an obfuscating term. Its vagueness does not help in communicating the EU position to the public (nobody goes around worrying if there is enough integrity in the single market) or to the UK. Worse, it threatens to muddle the EU’s own thinking about what it wants. At worst it becomes a mantra for stalling because it is never clear what is or is not covered by “integrity”. 

So we must disentangle what precisely is required to protect the EU’s legal-economic order.

First, the same rules for all. The EU is a combined regulatory and customs union, which in turn necessitates a common regulatory and customs border to the outside. Conversely, one can only dispense with border checks against countries that both apply the EU’s regulatory and customs rules and enforce them on their own external borders.

Britain’s willingness to accept a “common rule book” (which means the EU’s) is a big step towards recognising this reality. But not big enough. The Chequers plan still draws the scope of the rule book too narrowly (excluding labelling rules, for instance). It continues to resist the common external tariff and trade policy, clinging to confused schemes to enforce two tariffs at once. 

Second, integrity refers to common jurisdiction and enforcement: the same rights must include the exact same obligations. It is not true that the EU cannot trust third countries to do this. It trusts European Economic Area members and should accept the same governance arrangement for the UK. I mean this literally: the European Free Trade Association court is the ideal mechanism for enforcing EU rules on goods. It already does this well.

From both these perspectives, the UK’s current proposal is insufficient but technically straightforward to complete. To avoid freeriding and incoherence, the UK must accept a customs union (even if it calls it something else) and a fuller rule book, adjudicated by an international court. If (or when) it does this, the imaginary scenario outlined above becomes real. Until then, EU leaders can skirt the argument over whether the very idea of a free movement area for goods only undermines the whole European construct.

They have said they think it does. But many of their arguments are weak: Michel Barnier makes a point of how goods are often bundled with services, but this is just as true in conventional trade deals, and is never used as an argument against them. In any case the EU can reserve the right to regulate or deny the trade in bundled services.

Then there is the idea that extending the free movement area for goods only beyond the full single market makes the latter politically unstable. But note that the EEA does something similar: services and people move freely, whereas goods remain subject to customs checks. An improved UK proposal would respect the integrity of the internal market better than the EEA does by removing all border frictions for goods.

Free movement of goods would mean the extension of full EU authority for goods beyond its territory; a codification of the “Brussels effect” where other countries freely follow EU decisions. For any other third country, this would surely be seen as a triumph of the EU’s legal-economic order, rather than a threat to it. The answer to the proposal I outlined above would surely be “yes”.

The EU promises to treat the UK as a third country after Brexit. So it should, by standing ready to accept an improved Chequers offer and declaring a resounding victory. ",Europe,/r/europe/comments/93e9ev/theresa_mays_chequers_proposal_is_best_route_to/e3cj42j/,MrrPooooopybutthole,1533042020

A group of people (University students iirc) were asked whether they would support a measure that wouldn't impact the US economy but shrink Japan's by, say, five per cent, or another one where Japan's economy would shrink by 10% and the US's by 5%.

The problem with a lot of foreign aid is that it ruins the local economy, in turn making the people dependent on the aid. If the aid stops, there is nothing to pick up the supply.

Take clothes for example. I refuse to donate clothes to charities that send them to developing nations. I'd rather burn them. Because what's the result? Millions of tshirts are sent to Africa yearly to be given to 'people in need'. When they arrive there, they aren't given away, they're sold for pennies (can't blame the locals for doing so). As a result, locals that make their own traditional clothing or try to start up a local clothing factory can't compete with the influx of cheap/free western clothes and go out of business.

I see people around me running circles around this problem: how to prevent politicians from becoming corrupt? I say: we should start thinking of ways of not having politicians at all.

2154,"Well deficit is not necessarily a bad thing. Especially when it comes to countries.

There are two ways to approach deficit: one is a bad one that everybody knows - borrowing money to pay for subsidies, pay off debt, paying for general spendings. That results in Greece.

But when talking about deficit every forgets about the good part. Let’s say your budget allows you to cover all the spendings 100%. That’s great, keep it up, that is the whole point of it.

But when you are an entity of a size of a country, that is bit lazy thinking. If your economy and spendings are covered, you should start investing. And the best way to invest proper is to borrow money, as borrowed capital is actually cheaper, than your own one.

Let’s take a simple example. You have 100 millions to invest. You can make an investment that will altogether give you 150 million in return (imaginary numbers). And that’s okay. 50 mil profit for future budget/investments.

But when you do not need to worry about your back line - like a country you can do something better. Why make one investment? Borrow another 100 mil and make two investments. Split 50/50. Now you have altogether 300 mil in return. Minus 100 of your own capital, minus (let’s say) 110 mil in money and interest for the lender. And you are left with 90 mil, from 100 mil investment from your own capital. That is a nice boost for both economy and future budget. 0% deficit is lazy and inefficient.

Now that is nice eh? And as a country with stable economy you can get some real nice rates, as lender feels safe and for him it is basically free money in the future. Also this way you also hedge your investments. If one of those flops, than you still have another one. So instead of for example plain losing 100 mil, you end up with 0.

Like I mentioned before.. Its a partriarchial society. To really understand the oppression of women. You need to see the perspective of someone chained to the Religion who escaped it. Arranged marriage, the family pressure.. To be threatened with her life with a note, on the dead body of a co-producer because she was an apostate.

Ayaan Hirsi Ali on Islam
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe_cuzsmmHU

Listen to this woman carefully if you have the time. Its an entire culture with a precept on patriarchial society. It is in the Quran indeed that those who support and cloath you and raise you have dominion over you. And you should be subservient as a woman. Their role is to provide. Yours is to obey. And in by not doing so, you are not a good muslim woman.

&gt; Muslim Arranged Marriages in India

&gt; Firstly if the daughter remains unmarried  she is considered a spinster, who brings shame upon her family, and she is considered a burden. A woman also suffers this fate if she is separated or single past 24 years old (Stein)
_________________________
&gt; In the Muslim faith, it is the responsibility of the parents to provide for the education and the marriage of their children. The parent’s duties are not considered complete unless their daughter is happily married (Ahmad 53).  Marriage is a sunna, an obligation from the parent to the child that must be fulfilled because the female is viewed as a par gaheri, a person made for someone else’s house (53). In this custom, it is the responsibility of the groom’s parents to make the initial move toward marriage: seeking eligible females and insuring their son is marketable. Once a female has been selected, the father of the male sends a letter to the perspective bride’s father, through a maulvi, a liaison between the families, asking the father if his daughter can marry his son. If the female’s father accepts by letter, then a formal ceremony is held at the female’s house, where the father of the groom asks the girl’s father if his daughter can marry. A feast and perhaps the giving of gifts, depending on the region of the exchange, follow the “asking” ceremony. During the feast, the respective parents set a time to solemnize the marriage, “usually during the summer season (garmiyan) because it allows more time for people to attend” (98). The date of the actual marriage ceremony depends on the age of the individuals, which ranges from four years to eight years after the “asking” ceremony (97).

The hindu faith, in contrast has a lot less religious pressure on women and parents with regard to be 'failures' in their faith. If a Hindu does similar actions like the article above... I can see how your sentiment of being 'prideful' could apply. However, the Muslim faith, is more religiously aggressive in seeing both the family and daughter as failures unto god.

Secondly the limited air strikes to protect the Libiyan rebels from genocide by Gadaffis forces were called by France and the UK with the US providing support.

The fact that there were what were essentially multiple civil wars against the remaining dictators in the Middle East is something that hopefully the Arab people will remember as what happens when you tolerate dictators for so long.

It was not so long ago that the whole of Europe kicked out their dictators as well (They were called Kings) and established democracies after long and brutal civil wars.

There is little difference with what is happening in the middle east and north africa other than the fact that  - unbelievably - there has not been a single ""invasion"" on the ground from any of the Western powers you described since 2003. Which everyone collectively recognizes as a giant mistake.

There is a crisis because there is a crisis.

2325,"You're not wrong in your first statement ... but historical doesn't really matter too much, seeing as how global warming became a major issue in the past 5 decades, and in that time the US has been one of the lowest performing nations - especially if you factor in sheer size of economy.

Essentially, because the US is, and was, such a monumental economy they should have done more. It's kind of like comparing a child to an adult, and then saying that the adult performed adequate work because he lifted as much in 1 hour as the child did in 1 day - it's true, but the adult was still lazy as fuck.

&gt;Also, it's simply not true that the US is the only large country with high per capita emissions.

I said the US was the only super large economic area with a per capita emission in the obscene levels.

I'd argue EU, US, and China are super large economic areas.

&gt;First of all, large countries in general have higher emission rates because they tend to be more sparsely organized, so transporting yourself from point A to B generally requires more fuel.

I constantly hear this from Americans, and it's such a laughably dumb argument.

Do you yourself, or do you think that a majority of Americans, move themselves thousands of miles a day? No? Then why on earth do you think the size matters?

Last I read Americans actually only transport themselves, and their goods, around 20% longer distances than their European brethren.

France is decently sized, and they have emissions 1/3 of the US. Would you argue that you transport yourselves 3 times as far as French people?

Do you really think that people in New York, LA, Miami, Houston and all other big cities in the US leave those cities on a daily commute? No right?

You know why those 3 nations you mentioned all have very high per capita emissions? Because they all refused to do anything about climate change 30 years ago.

I'm not saying size doesn't factor in, but you seem to have some fantasy that the US population is spread evenly throughout the entire nation - while in reality the vast majority lives tightly packed along the coasts, or towards the southern border.

In fact, [80.7% of Americans live in Urban areas](https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-cities-population/more-americans-move-to-cities-in-past-decade-census-idUSL2E8EQ5AJ20120326), and the vast majority of them work in those same urban areas.

The reality is simply that the US refused to implement a carbon tax, so using carbon fuels is cheap - this of course means more people use them.

Electricity is cheap, so people aren't looking at saving as much as they do if it was expensive. This is why people leave the A/C on 24/7 and often wear sweaters inside ... while the A/C is on. This is why a lot of lighting in the US is still happening with traditional bulbs.

It's also why the most popular car in the country is a huge pickup truck that has insanely high emission levels: because gasoline is so cheap.

I hope the US does more, but with Trump in charge it's looking like many places will do a lot less. Thankfully some states actually care - but those that don't have a free pass now.",,/r/europe/comments/932r7t/sweden_to_reach_its_2030_renewable_energy_target/e3c6y0z/,upvotesthenrages,1533020834

&gt; ""You don't feel like a normal Russian citizen here. You feel like a soldier, maybe even in another country and on a secret mission. It's totally different from normal life,"" says Nikita. Though the occasional child is sent to learn discipline at the camp, the organizers say for many of the participants this is an ""initial taste of military life."" The eyes of one 14-year old in the group brighten as he fantasizes about the future. ""Maybe I'll even become a mercenary,"" he says, before being hushed up on the subject by those around him.

This is just not normal. Let the children grow up to be normal citizens before influencing them into being soldiers. The fact that a country that is invading their neighbors is doing this just makes it worse, but I don't think you'll agree with me here.

2377,"&gt;Some asked why there was no mention of Jews selling out their neighbors to various enemies over the centuries. Others questioned whether Poles were really involved in a notorious World War II massacre. Anti-Semitism, it seemed, was acceptable again.

Yeah, asking questions is now antisemitism...

&gt;Poland’s Jewish community—Europe’s largest, numbering 3 million, or almost 10 percent of the country in 1933—was decimated by the Nazis. Its number has dwindled to about 10,000 from the 250,000 who remained after World War II. After a March 1968 purge by Poland’s communist authorities, the Jewish population dropped to as low as 5,700 in the late 1970s.

If I din't know history, I would had left with the impression Polish government killed hundreds of thousands of Jews after reading this paragraph. But what really happened was that hundreds  of thousands had emigrated to newly formed Israel. Which even considering the constant war with neighbors was still so much better than Soviet Poland many Poles tried to fake Jewish heritage to join the emigration.

&gt;Even Mick Jagger warned Poland...

And this is relevant how?

For that time period, it was quite 'centralized'. The Emperor was way more powerful than during later stage of the HRE. Although, it's hard to really be centralized at that time...

The Carolingian Empire (wasn't called the HRE) was strong because the Emperor pretty much had all the power and was taking the decisions. Marches and vassal states didn't have much of a say. The nobility (barely existent, at the time) could argue and present their opinion to the Emperor, but in no way could oppose him (wasn't also in their interest).

And coming back to the dissolution of the HRE, by the time it happened, it was almost inefficient.

&gt; [wives] should not commit any open indecency (fāḥishah). If they do, then God permits you to shut them in separate rooms and to beat them

Bringing such cultural beliefs... Hurts the western principles, even if they do not have the 'legal' framework to enact them.

From Muslim websites.

As for 'forced marriage'....

&gt; Yes, it is a duty on the father to keep his children chaste by arranging their marriages, and spending on them and clothing them, if he is able to do so. If he is not able to, but the mother, grandfather or grandmother is able, it becomes that person’s duty to arrange the marriage


&gt;  As stated in the fatwa of Shaykh Ibn Ibraaheem mentioned above, some of the scholars have stated that if a women shows that she accepts her marriage to someone to whom she was married by force, then she forfeits the right to seek annulment of the marriage. If she forfeits the right to seek annulment, then the man becomes a legitimate husband to her. If that is the case, then it is not permissible for you to take contraceptive pills without his knowledge, if there is a need for that.

Boy, are you fine? I openly called it an occupation and not even used the word aid in anywhere. Are you sleepy or something?

Are you really claiming there wasn't a coup d'état? Like seriously? Seriously seriously? Good that you've edited that away. 

&gt; This notion or 'propaganda' that Cypriots were killing and targeting Turkish cypriots is stupid.

You mean Greek Cypriot elements targeting Turkish Cypriots? I'm not sure how something is propaganda when there are literally mass graves and massacred villages. Let's call it a fact and move on.

&gt; The Junta was agressive to anyone who supported the actual democratically elected Cypriot government. Greek Cypriots were just as much a target as Turkish Cypriots.

I'm nor sure how this changes the reality that there was a fascist coup d'état, it was backed by Greece, Greek forces on island were actively behind that and Greece was trying to annex Cyprus. That provided the reason and the legal frame for Turkey to invade. Not saying Turkey did that for the greater good of the island, nor the second operation was great or outcome was something good. Although these aren't changing how the invasion was enabled.

&gt; If you want to blame Greece for this... Do so.. Fine.. But that does NOT depose or excuse the larger war crimes/deaths/instability/long standing occupation of Turkey.

Greece and fascists who came up with a coup d'état on the island were to blame. Nobody is excusing things you're saying either.

&gt; But Cyprus holds no blame for the actions of the Junta and the far right backing they had by a minority, or the Turkish OVER-REACTION.

There wasn't an over-reaction. Turkish Cypriots were under oppression that started with a planned terror wave but nothing had been done even during that period. When Greek Junta attempted to practically invade the island and take it over for good, that was a reaction that Turkey was enabled, even without the fascist and extreme elements who have came up with the coup thanks to Greece backing them started to mass massacre Turkish Cypriots. You may say that Turkey screwed up, wasn't with the finest intentions, brought instability, used the situation for its own interests and I'd agree with that. But that's not changing how and why the military invasion was enabled and was legal at least for the first invasion.

Now we're calling names? Turkey was enabled and that enabling was due to Greek Junta and the failed Cypriot junta they came up with. I don't see where the hell Turkey is responsible for Greece trying to take over the island, using its forces and Greek Cypriot fascist elements and take over the rule on the island.

&gt; The Junta fell in Greece in 1974.... FFS... The same year Cyprus was occupied.... The Junta and the right wingers had nothing.

Greek Junta fell after the first invasion of Turkey, and fell due to that very reason.

Greek Junta and the failed fascist coup in Cyprus led by the far right elements had everthing to do with each other as well.

&gt; Cyprus would have been fine without a Turkish intervention.

We'd never know but I don't see Cyprus being fine without the coup failing and Greek Junta being a thing. I also don't see Turkish Cypriots being good or even being existing on the island under a fascist junta led by far right and controlled by Greece, or after a Greek annexation. I'm sure ones that has been put in mass graves weren't fine either.

&gt; Could have helped the PM who was ousted... Instead they took over half the island, and created inhumanitarian death count, and mass refugees. An illegal occupation of an island that stands till this day..

True. Yet again, it doesn't change how the invasion was enabled, and how the reason was and blame was on Greece and the far right elements first. Turkey and its actions was enabled by those, and these were the cause and beginning for things you happen to be listing like if I'm saying something else.

&gt; You are trying to defer blame, to a dictatorship, that does not even exist anymore... For something Turkey is ACTIVELY doing.

I'm pointing out the blame to what have happened and the parties to blame. Occupation and the following actions of Turkey are **after** those, and made possible thanks to those. We were arguing about how the first invasion turn out to be a thing, how it was enabled and why it was within the legal frame and so on, right?

The shifting of manufacturing jobs from Europe/NA to China/India etc has put a lot a pressure on the Europeans/Americans and their families/communities. That's why you have this career focus in the developed world (instinctively you know that a job is not granted and you could loose it at any time). It's a great weight placed on our shoulders and not sure if our governments are willing to take a step back (without a fight) and allow (let's say) the Chinese to take the lead. A focus on career leads to a regimented life which leads to less children. 

This is true of all developed world as Japan, Korea are part the Western system of values too.

So if the UK does Brexit is that the EU's cue to invade?

You conveniently forget, that the Greek Cypriots in the last official Census, were 80% of the population. Im not saying I agreed with enosis, or that most of the population did either.. But a vote to do so is reasonable.

There is your 'casus belli' to invade again.

2774,"&gt;The woman was taken to Bangladesh with other family members for what they had been told was a holiday.

&gt;But the parents had made extensive plans for her wedding to a **first cousin**.

Cousin marriage is hideous for the genetic defects it causes. This article refers to Bangladesh, but among Pakistanis in Britain, where the practice is very common, it leads to huge problems.

[British Pakistanis account for 3% of child births but 30% of British children born with a genetic illness.](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/mother-tongue/4014743/Warning-over-births-to-first-cousin-marriages.html) And this is old data - the thing with cousin marriage is that it necessarily gets worse over time genetically as you increase the likelihood of passing on two of the same lethal/debilitating recessive genes.

People often say things like ""well what does cultural diversity cost you, how does it stop you living your life""? Well here's a concrete example, a culture of cousin marriage saps my tax money for the NHS to deal with genetic defects. A culture of forced marriages saps my tax money to the court systems.

These things are normal in Pakistan/Bangladesh, they should never become normal here.

Edit:

&gt;While only 15 per cent of the population in Bradford is of Pakistani origin, an estimated 55 per cent are married to their first cousins.

This is an issue about having all UK citizens to be expected to respect western UK laws and basic human rights. And in my opinion, UK laws (and European and American) need to be stricter on 'religions and cultures' that oppose human rights and western values.

I am for an anti-family marriage law. And pro aboloshing these cultural norms through law. For the sake of human rights, and protecting all citizens. Even changing this 'cultural' norm amongst bangladeshis and so on.

The fact is that they are UK, citizens, and need to behave as such. And if not, prison and the courts should be ready to intervene.

Politically because it's easier for you to throw money at a program than to justify cultural change and massive assimilation costs.

Culturally because you don't have to deal with endless distractions from debate between multicultural fanatics and nationalists and you don't have boiling tensions.

Militarily because your military will be relying on Spaniards and not on drawing from a pool of culturally foreign people, many of which do not support your foreign policy, who may not even fight for you and might join your enemies.

Most of his work originates from the time of the industrial revolution , a time in which workers lived in conditions that are incomprehensible by todays standards. I think it is also important to separate theory and what other people chose to do or justify with it.

[Second] (https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/8hqbco/protest_in_favour_of_the_karl_marx_statue_in/?sort=top) thread the top 2 comments were pretty of topic but here's the 3rd one : Marx is one of the most influencial philosophers of the 19th century and of Germany. You can agree or disagree with his observations and especially his conclusions.

[Third] (https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/8hqbot/protest_against_the_karl_marx_statue_in_trier/?sort=top) thread top comment:  Marxism lays the ideological foundation to a large extent social democracy as well.

Most of the worker rights movements in the world were inspired by Marxism. The biggest advances in worker rights have been due to worker movements.

Marx's analysis on a lot of things was completely accurate. Many of his theories were too. He was a great academic with a lot of good analysis. There are a lot of accurate criticisms of him as well.

He is responsible for zero of the crimes or atrocities committed by states.

Nowhere did I say anything like that. 

&gt; but I'm pretty sure those people working there still needed to be paid.

Again: You keep lighting up that strawman, makes me wonder what that poor guy ever did to you.

&gt; Why don't the employees go work elsewhere? 

Because there is no ""elsewhere"", maybe you've missed it but jobs don't grow on trees and average productivity went through the roof, thanks due to automation, in these past decades. Yet at the same time, we've got more and more people who are all supposed to have a job.

That same automation will also be responsible for seeing more and more traditional jobs replaced. You know the tale of the horseshoers at the advent of the first combustion-powered cars?

Imagine this with the service sector, and then you will have a picture of how many ""jobs"" will actually be required in the future. But when those warehouse workers will be redundant, due to automation, you will still put all the blame on them for not being ""qualified"", they should have learned something useful like being a hedge-fund manager or try their luck at the code-monkey lottery, the modern day digital equivalent of a talent gold rush.

&gt; You don't need connections to get a loan from a bank or the bank to invest in your endeavor.

Nothing of note happens in Silicon Valley without private venture capital being involved in some way or another.
But to anybody in the vicinity to that tech bubble, it only makes their lives miserable and more expensive.

2901,"&gt; There's a difference between factual reporting, which is what both The Guardian and Reuters are doing in their articles, and spitting out opinions, which the Guardian also does indeed.

You left the third option. Put certain news on the megaphone and suppress others.

&gt; But not in this particular article.

They put on a megaphone that a black woman got attacked and they hype it like some national emergency. How many times did they put out all the instances of Italians attacked by black people? How come this is not newsworthy? I'm sure the opposition also had certain things to say about those attacks (in fact Salvini did comment on such attacks when he was in opposition). Was that newsworthy at the time? Are black people some kind of untouchable royalty according to the media since their injuries are much more newsworthy comparing to the injuries that whites suffer when blacks are perpetrators?

It's just reporting huh. 

&gt; I'll ask you the same question I asked the other guy. What should we read instead?

Read news from both sides. If you only read the mainstream then you'll miss out tons of stories that don't align with the narrative. I've seen you too many times to find the most biased story out of the MSM and run with it like is some kinda of gospel. This tells me you're stuck in bubble and you need to broaden your horizon. Yes, read even Breitbart or 'Voice of Europe'. Of course all news have certain bias, but you're not going to see it if you never venture out. Read left and right. Read even reactionaries and communists. More different sources you read, easier it will become to notice the bias, which will in turn allow you to weed out the bs (and there is alot of it) and get the picture that at least resembles something closer to the truth.

Non-EU born men have lower employment rate in many EU countries, not only women. In Germany, non-EU men have 71.5% emloyment rate while native-born men have 84.7% employment rate. In France, it is 66.9% against 75.7%. In Netherlands: 68.8% / 85.1%. Sweden is another case with 71.5% / 86.5%.

On the other hand, in the UK both groups have comparable results 82.6% / 82.8%. And  in the Czech republic, non-EU born males have employment rate of whooping 90.3% compared with native men´s 86.2%.

There results are rather result of lower education level of non-EU immigrants in some EU countries (like France or Sweden) compared to natives. That makes them outsiders on job market.

Accordingly, it is best that, where fossil fuels are extracted, they are extracted in poor countries, making those countries wealthier. Rich countries like Norway (and Ireland, though our resources are modest) should leave their fossil fuels in the ground. That way, the fossil fuels that are tapped bring money to poor, not rich countries. ",Ireland,/r/europe/comments/932r7t/sweden_to_reach_its_2030_renewable_energy_target/e3b1xme/,ciarogeile,1532977936
2953,"I think its mostly related to the Made in China 2025. 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Made_in_China_2025

Its an interesting read and explains why the West has become increasingly suspicious of China lately (and it actually makes you realise the whole deal of Trumps trade war). A big reason why the West has ""tolerated"" China is because they believed they would eventually democratize and adopt a system similar to the West and their partners when they slowly joined the world stage like what happened to India. That didnt happen, given that you know, they are still ruled by a communist one party regime and they have no intention to change that.

 
Its funny, the West thought that economic growth and prosperity would make the Chinese people less supportive of the regime and more supportive of democratic parties. What essentialy happened was that the Chinese regime took credit for the economic growth that the country has experienced in the past decades and used it to legitimize their rule. Most Chinese people, when asked about their system, points towards all the progress and wealth the Chinese people have gained and dont seem to care about anything else. They know their system has a lot of mistakes and is quite corrupt, but why should they care when they went from litterally peasants to middle class in one lifetime?",Norway,/r/europe/comments/9357rv/germany_expected_to_block_chinese_purchase_of/e3b1y7r/,Pleasedont__,1532977951

2961,"No, ""rescue"" literally means ""to save (someone) from a dangerous or difficult situation."" which given the death toll of this kind of trip, it certainly is.

In any case, rescued migrants are not just given free citizenships as they land. They are sent to detention centers which in the best case scenario will have the necessary infrastructure to guarantee acceptable living conditions while they wait (but which unfortunaly isn't often the case due to limited resources). They have a right to ask for asylum, but in the vast majority of cases they will be sent back to their origin countries.

About the xenophobic right, I think it will not rise in Spain as it did elsewhere, not because of a lack of survival instinct, but because the majority of our society doesn't see this kind of migration (which has been ongoing for decades before the current crisis struck other European countries) as a threat to our survival.

3158,"&gt;So there's no room for dissenting opinions in your society? Isn't there a  forum where ideas could meet and be exchanged? How would this society  improve itself?

Like I said earlier, the workers collectives serve as a way to voice your concerns and collaborate on solutions. If your dissent means oppressing others, imposing your authority over others or removing peoples ability to freely associate with others then it is believed that people would choose to not associate with you.

If your dissenting opinion is on, to continue my earlier example, how to manufacture or design shoes, then of course you would be free to do so. If your opinion has any merit, others will choose to collaborate with you and the result would be better shoes. Everyone benefits.

&gt;What if you make the best shoes and everybody wants your shoes? What about the other shoemakers?

Then I share my knowledge with them. I cannot create shoes for everyone myself, can I? I will need to have skilled labor. And the hope is that if I freely share my knowledge others will contribute to it and further improve upon it. This is how, for example, the modern Open Source community works!

&gt;I  think the essential problem with utopias is that they are based on the idea that we can reach perfection. This is a very unnatural idea, there  is no such thing as perfection. We are continuously evolving and  improving. Any society should allow for means of self-improvement and  yours doesn't seem to do that.

At what point did I present this as an utopia? Of course our society does need to evolve and improve! The main point of Anarcho-Syndicalism is just to move the drive for improvement away from direct competition towards mutually beneficial cooperation. I don't claim to hold all of the answers. I just believe that capitalism has and is continuing to fail to uphold its promise, and the millions of people dying from preventable disease and hunger, the constant warring in third world countries to uphold military industrial profits, etc are a testament to that.

&gt;Don't you think it's a bit arrogant to think you have the recipe for success in terms of societies, despite all experiments based on similar ideas failing miserably before?

Don't you think it is a bit arrogant to believe that capitalism is the ""end state"" of human society? Should we stop trying just because we failed? Or should we examine **why** the earlier experiments failed and continue trying?

Also, many of the failures of socialism can, at least partially, be attributed to capitalist interventionism by the US and its allies.

including japan and australia, whom have stated that the UK will be at the back of the line.

a soft brexit means nothing changes, the UK leaves yes, but it still adheres to the 4 freedoms and continues on paying for the perks, including the common market.

Plus as the demand for wood fuel goes up, there is more potential for illigal or non-renewable deforestation globally.

&gt;What's you take on European cultures in general?

Don’t get me wrong. I love Europe. Have been there a dozen times and all over. I think the diversity in culture is a lot more distinct and in some ways more diverse than *just* the Arabs specifically. Europe definitely has a common history and religious identity that contributed a lot to the previous and current social structures. European powers have definitely influenced each other, and all of them have definitely been influenced culturally by the Roman Empire. But unlike the Arabs there wasn’t really a set unifying factor until recently (I’d say human rights is what does it for the EU now). 

&gt;Do you think my take on it is more correct than simply saying there isn't an 'european identity'

Definitely. I was a little out of it. There is definitely an identity to being European, I just don’t think it’s as cohessive or as specific as being an Arab. There’s just more that unifies the Arab identity, and significantly much less ethnic nationalism that separates the Arab states unlike Europe.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/92y8b7/if_gdp_growth_prediction_is_right_for_2018_poland/e3ad9w7/,TheOneManFromIran,1532955992

Nuclear and hydro have the advantage to provide a constant stable stream. Solar and wind on the other hand are quite *erratic* and require the same amount of fossil power plants as backup.

Even though solar and wind power generation capacity are [steadily expanded](https://www.energy-charts.de/power_inst.htm), we haven't been able to cut down on fossil. And without large scale power storage its impossible.

3356,"&gt;PPP has nothing to do with 'quantity' and everything to do with 'worth'.

No,its specifically the exact opposite way around. The value of a good on the international market is in nominal expressed in a unitary value (usually dollar), so you know what the products and services generated are 'worth' in international comparison, this obviously distorts the actual amount of goods and services because of the currency exchange rate between the two different countries.

PPP eliminates the currency exchange, or attempts to do so, as a factor in this comparison so you know how much was produced, rather than how much value was generated.

Imagine two countries produce the same amount of goods in a year. Their GDP would be the same. Now imagine they have two different currencies, and they have a exchange rate is 1:2. Now it would look as if one has double the production of the other country, which is obviously not true. So if you eliminate the currency exchange rate (which is what PPP does), and now you know how much they actually produced. Obviously GDP is not just production but it applies to all other values as well.

GDP (PPP) gauges more accurately a countries production in quantity.

&gt;In contemporary macroeconomics, **gross domestic product (GDP)** refers to **the total monetary value** of the goods and services produced within one country.

&gt; The actual purchasing power of any currency is the quantity of that currency needed to buy a specified unit of a good or a basket of common goods and services.

Edit: In short, GDP nominal is for comparing the value of two countries on the world market. GDP PPP is for estimating a countries domestic market i.e. the size of it with disregard to the value of it.
Basically if I turn all the money of a country into dollar, How much shit can I buy. I Can buy more stuff with all the money in China than I could with all the money in the US.

Or for this comparison, Poland produces more stuff, but its stuff has less value because of inefficencies etc. so its GDP PPP is much higher, but its nominal is slightly lower because its stuff has less value on the world market.",,/r/europe/comments/92y8b7/if_gdp_growth_prediction_is_right_for_2018_poland/e3a8j60/,[deleted],1532949007

This boils down to a relatively small fraction of the city's population that somehow manages to never leave the city (or only leave it to go abroad or to other big cities, or just far away).

3474,"No no no. What you need to understand is that the vast vast majority of fortunes don't last long. For example, only about half of the people in the top 1% today will still be there in just 1 year. Also, 70% of generational wealth (wealth passed from one generation to the next) disapears by the second generation. And, more than 11% or Americans will be in the top 1% for at least a year of their life. This all means that wealth turn over is very high among the rich making it hard for many individuals to truly consolidate much power.

""The rich will have everything while the poor have nothing"". This just makes no sense. The poor will always have power over the rich. For example, Elon musk is a multi billionaire according to his ""wealth"" however the vast majority of this wealth isnt sitting in his bank account, it is locked up in the value of his companies. Meaning he must ensure the success of his companies in order to maintain this extreme wealth. His companies' success is entirely at the mency of his employees. For this reason the rich can never become a monolith of power. They are almost always completely reliant of their (comparatively) poor employees who have serious power over them.

Also, in regards to your ""rich owning everything"" statement the rich don't go around buying everything they see for fun. Nor can they. The rich can only buy what others (including the poor) are willing to sell. As for the things they can buy: If you are worried about, let's say, the rich owning all the land, you shouldn't be. People only buy things if they serve a purpose and the rich don't go around buying land just for the sake of owning lots of land. The only reason a rich person would buy land is to exploit it's natural resources (which is good for the consumer), develop it and later sell it or parts of it (Which is good for the consumer looking for a house let's say), or for personal use which is a comparatively tiny amount of land. Wealth doesn't instantly translate into things. Most wealth as I've said is tied up in the value of their companies and can disapear very quickly.

3502,"&gt; Identifying Arab people aren't as simple as it might sound, yes people in the Middle East and North Africa might largely identify as arabs today but historically speaking Arabs are only from the Arabian peninsula

Well this is just wrong. Arabs have intermingled across the levant, Persia and Egypt for a long time. And for those that weren’t, they’ve been Arabicized. Hell, the first mention kf Arabs was in 900 BCE as a nomadic tribe in Syria.

&gt;in fact people slowly started to self-identify as Arabic after centuries of caliphate rule. 

This was well over a thousand years ago. People began to self identify as Arabs because there was virtually no literary culture and very weak identity in these territories. 

&gt;Arabs outside the Arab peninsula are as much Arabic as they're Syrian, Iraqi, Lebanese, Egyptian..

Arguing genealogy doesn’t really change the fact that Arab culture and Arab identity is much more cohessive than the continent of Europes which is made up of many distinct ethnic groups and encompasses a much bigger diversity of languages and even language families.

&gt;I'm by no mean an expert but your argument makes no sense when we use Arabs as an example.

Thankfully I am an expert on ME anthropology, and specifically linguistics, and I don’t see anything that negates the truth that culturally Arabs are significantly more homogenous than Europeans. 

&gt;It's like saying a Brittish, Chinese and Mexican live together and now they they all should be identified as Chinese..

Well, I have the perfect example for you. Mexicans, Chinese and Brits moved to America over hundreds of years and now *identify* as Americans. Identity is at the center of culture and ethicity. There is no such thing as being ethnically european. At least, not yet.

&gt;Arabs are as much of an ethnic group as 'European'. Arabs is more a cultural term than anything.

You’ve repeated this a lot, but Arabs at least share a language, literary culture, ethnic and religous customs/traditions, social structures etc. Europeans may share some things in common, no one is denying that, but it’s just not nearly as unifying (or not yet at least) as it has been for Arabs.

For me, this session was extremely eventful.
It started with me finishing the independence war my splendid enemy Delhi ""This is not enjoyable!"" has put me in. With the help of Uzbek I won pretty handily and managed to annex Afghanistan and Khorosan. As such, Transoxiana was my only vassal left to integrate.

After this long and devastating war I had to slay almost 60k seperatists that rose up during the war. I spend the next few years following that restabilizing and repaying almost 1000 ducats in loans.

At the end of the (half-)session I managed to squeeze out a war against Ajam and retook most of my cores, which further strenghened me.

And unfortunately, it is quite possible to oppose Apartheid in South Africa while being racist. For example, there are black South Africans who are racist against whites and who just wanted to turn the tables. It is possible that Corbyn is being discriminatory by being more lenient towards Muslims than towards atheists and Christians and Jews, or more lenient towards people of non-Jewish middle eastern descent (and blacks) than towards whites and Jews.

If Corbyn feels like he personally needs to engage in affirmative action to correct for social injustice, then all the above would require is him to overestimate the amount that is appropriate.

So, for this to be 'Corbyn's Labour', Corbyn needs to be supportive of too strong affirmative action within (and outside) Labour.

In that regard, your description of these parties policies is kinda cliched and tbh flat out wrong.

Both parties are very economically liberal and appeal to ""too much government interference in the market is bad"" mentalities. See: ""[Weniger Staat, mehr Freiheit und Selbstverantwortung](https://www.afd.de/steuern-finanzen-wirtschaft-arbeit/)""

Both parties want to get rid of the Soli by 2019.

FDP and AfD share extremely similar positions on issues like taxes. With both opposing property taxes and inheritance tax increases, especially for companies. 

Just like they have very similar positions on ""qualified refugees"".


This isn't about if you agree or disagree with these positions or what's happening, I'm just pointing out similarities that people are quick to overlook in favor of simplifying the situation as ""Only authoritarian neo-Nazi idiots vote AfD"", which is also a contributing factor to people voting AfD in the first place.

&gt;Trump’s tax relief ...is a classical example of the rich for the rich.  

Claire McCaskill used almost the exact same words, and was given two Pinocchios by the Washington Post. The rich benefit in terms of absolute dollars, sure, but only because our tax system is tremendously lopsided against them. The top 10% paid 80% of all taxes. And the top 0.1% paid an insane 25%. So yeah, they benefit because they’re paying all the bills, but on a percentage basis the middle and lower class did much better.

Why would I want the economy of say, London, if it comes directly at the cost of any semblance of a community, shared values/identity and leads to massive over congestion and housing shortage?

We in the UK have sold our social capital for supposed economic gain through incredibly high levels of immigration. I don't have a problem with migrants, one of my grandparents is French, but the scale we have had over the past 25 years from especially third world countries makes parts of England no longer feel British to me as a Scot. This is as a consequence of British governments (primarily Blair), not the EU, but an increasingly federal EU would have no interest in this slow erasure of the Britain I knew in lieu of some forced multicultural dystopia.

Why would I want this kind of fractured country for myself or my children?

3889,"&gt;You are bringing up Turkey when all I referred to was citizens of Greece. Unless you are asserting that the treaty binds individual citizens of Greece, my point holds. Lausanne doesn't make it illegal for **individuals to associate as Turks in Greece**, politically or otherwise.

You're being disingenuous, and I already addressed your claim. ANY individual in Greece can identify and associate with WHOMEVER they choose. You somehow think that means the Greek state must recognize any corporation (non-profit or otherwise) with *any name someone chooses*. That is not how it works, nor is it a violation of individual civil rights.

And of course I have every right to call you out on the treatments of minorities in Turkey. It is your government that is making this an issue (as it has irredentist claims) when they in turn have an abysmal human rights record.

&gt;Lausanne does not oblige the Greek state to deny members of its ""muslim"" minority the ability to associate on other dimensions. It is illegal to associate as Turks.

Again you are being disingenuous. Provide one example of members of the minority not being able to associate with others in their community. FFS, the Turkish members of the minority had even created a political party that still elects representatives ([Party of Friendship, Equality and Peace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_of_Friendship,_Equality_and_Peace)). So there you have it, political parties, schools, mosques, media, Sharia law, and everything else that most people in Turkey (Turks and minorities alike) cannot enjoy.

Now, let's compare these rights to those of the Greeks. Better yet, let's compare it to the rights of the sizable minority of Kurds.

&gt;I never said that they weren't.

Wow... that's your response to ethnic cleansing, treaty violations, civil rights abuses, and other deprivations against the Greeks in Turkey? And yet you're here complaining about what **NAME** the Greek government recognizes for otherwise legal corporations?

&gt;They can not associate as a given ethnic group, especially in a politically active manner.

You're just FLAT OUT LYING. More than a few members (including elected representatives) have stood in public (and some next to Turkish politicians) proclaiming ""*happy is he who calls himself a Turk***""** (the motto of butcher Kemal). You're free to point out any prosecutions against members of the minority for stating/associating with any particular ethnic group. 

Back to Greek minority in Turkey. Why does the Turkish government restrict the Patriarch from calling himself ""ecumenical""? Why is the school in Halki still closed? Why are the properties of the community confiscated and/or not allowed to be maintained? Why isn't Imbros and Tenedos administered autonomously by the original Greek inhabitants (per the Treaty of Lausanne)? Why is there a massive Turkish military based on Imbros (on confiscated land of local Greeks) which is against the treaty?",,/r/europe/comments/92kbu6/the_greeks_of_constantinople_welcome_the_entente/e39o253/,GeorgePapadopoulos,1532916014

You just want to make the situation worse with your erratic actions. You don't want there to be peace there, you just want more conflict there, it's clear from this reaction. How about forcing both sides to sit at a table, no concessions beforehand, and make them hash out a peace deal? Except this wouldn't work because the Palestinian governments (PA &amp; Hamas) won't work together. Then force Hamas to lay down their arms and have the PA actually become the government of all the Palestinian people so they can negotiate for their people, and not just the West Bank. 

There were great opportunities for peace from 2000-2008, the Palestinians flushed them down the toilet with the second intifada and the 2008 Gaza war. Those 2 actions made the Israeli parties that attempted peace so unpopular that they're irrelevant today. What do you think happens to the public perception that only extremists don't want peace when you have 5 years of very regular terrorist attacks and then a war declared by a party that won the democratic vote by plurality in Gaza? People stop believing that fairy tale and start voting for bibi. This situation would've been avoided had they accepted a peace deal in 2000, 2001 or before the Gaza war.

But Jews don't claim every territory where Jews live or have lived, only Israel, the ancestral, native land of the Jewish people. Also you do realize that Celts aren't a monolyth? Scots, Welsh and Bretons are Celts too yet they don't identify with Ireland. That's like saying Russia should have the right to claim all slavic countries from Bulgaria to Poland.

With this statement you showed your true colors btw. Because your concern isn't about the Israeli settlements, you are opposed to Israel as a state, you want it destroyed and its existence ceased. You accuse Israel of committing ethnic cleansing yet you're fully aware that if Israel would cease to exist, the first thing the Arabs and Palestinians would is to start massacring and ethnically cleansing every Jewish city, town and village.",Serbia,/r/europe/comments/92u1x6/irish_senate_passes_israeli_settlement_boycott/e397piq/,Petique,1532898382

4046,"&gt;Speaking to the UN General Assembly in September 1960, Nasser had stated that ""The only solution to Palestine is that matters should return to the condition prevailing before the error was committed — i.e., the annulment of Israel's existence."" In 1964 he said, ""We swear to God that we shall not rest until we restore the Arab nation to Palestine and Palestine to the Arab nation. There is no room for imperialism and there is no room for Britain in our country, just as there is no room for Israel within the Arab nation."" In 1965 he asserted, ""We shall not enter Palestine with its soil covered in sand, we shall enter it with its soil saturated in blood.""[46]

I can get you quotes from Arab leaders urging Zionist Europeans not to create a Jewish state in heart of Palestine against the locals wishes and that it would only lead to war and even suggesting autonomy for Jewish areas your literally cherry picking quotes without context. If they wanted to commit genocide against Jews they had every opportunity to for centuries. They’re won’t be one single Jew alive in the Arab world  for that whole time. Just recently a Israeli Minister said he would blow up Lebanon back to the Stone Age dosent that mean Israel wants to commit genocide against Lebanese?

Does that sound like they're there to plant the seeds of peace and prosperity? This was the leader of Egypt at the time.
In May 1967, Hafez al-Assad, then Syria's Defense Minister declared: ""Our forces are now entirely ready not only to repulse the aggression, but to initiate the act of liberation itself, and to explode the Zionist presence in the Arab homeland. The Syrian Army, with its finger on the trigger, is united... I, as a military man, believe that the time has come to enter into a battle of annihilation.""[186]
Then how about this? Is this not genocidal enough?

Except they’re talking about Israel as a state who they viewed as colonial state that should be destroyed not as Jews a whole. Like I said before Jews had lived under Arab rule in Syria and elsewhere for centuries they could have committed genocide of they wanted but they didn’t.

&gt;President Abdul Rahman Arif of Iraq said that ""the existence of Israel is an error which must be rectified. This is an opportunity to wipe out the ignominy which has been with us since 1948"".[185] The Iraqi Prime Minister predicted that ""there will be practically no Jewish survivors"".
Then this? When do they become genocidal enough for you to believe they wanted to commit genocide?


Except Iraq was hardly even involved. And most Arab leaders where talking about the European Zionist settlers and distinguished between the local native Jewish populations.

4058,"You're absolutely and completely out of your mind if you think there is no risk of electrocution in this situation. You don't know the chemical contamination within this water that could make it more conductive. There's a metric fuckload of factors that could cause someone to be electrocuted in this situation, I'm not saying it's likely, but saying ""you cannot get electrocuted in this situation"" is a dangerously ignorant thing to spread to the masses.  If you spent even two minutes doing a bit of research you would see this is absolutely not true, and while it may not be incredibly likely to happen, it absolutely can

And not to mention the fact that not only are they just in the water, they are potentially submerging a significant portion of their body incresing the surface area and the potential for electrocution. And the fact they are bringing their heads close to the water, their hair is obviously wet meaning the water has made contact with the heads at some point. It's not exactly a stretch to think they might accidently ingest something here. 

The general rule is if it's above waist deep, it's significantly more dangerous in terms of electricity, If they were simply walking through like the other people I might be more inclined to agree with you, there's minimal potential for electricity to go through them, and there's pretty much zero chance of water entering their bodies, but this isn't the case. They are submerging themselves here, taking relatively shallow water and vastly increasing the contact area around their bodies.

I don't know about you, but when it comes to completely unnecessary risk of death because of doing something you have absolutely no good reason to do, I absolutely wouldn't risk it, and would never advise someone to do so

And for the whole ""you need to drink the water"" thing, it's not exactly a stretch to accidently ingest water while swimming.. and yet another case of well if you don't have to, why would you? There's an actual risk here that you're willingly taking just for a picture and some stupid internet likes/points

You're trying to talk down the risk in this situation, like it's not a big deal.. when the reality is there is still a very real risk of these things happening, and these people are putting themselves into a potentially dangerous situation for absolutely no good reason.

There's absolutely no reason anyone should be entering flood Waters, especially when they are contained indoors, unless they absolutely need to. And spreading the idea that it's not that big of a deal or whatever is just ridiculous. You have no idea what these Waters contain, you don't know the electrical layout of the facility, and you have no good reason to be entering that water, especially in this situation for a picture, I will never promote willfully endangering yourself over a picture in an obvious uncontained situation of which you have no idea what dangers lie within. 

Will they probably be fine? Sure. 

Is there a real risk of a needless injury or death by doing it? Absolutely..

4132,"&gt; No, it really is. See how non-productive this gets when you don't cite a treaty/law or your reasoning?

I have. You are bringing up Turkey when all I referred to was citizens of Greece. Unless you are asserting that the treaty binds individual citizens of Greece, my point holds.

Lausanne doesn't make it illegal for individuals to associate as Turks in Greece, politically or otherwise.

&gt; Since an association/corporation requires state recognition, it is in Greece's discretion to do so (as it needs to comply with constitutional, legal, and treaty obligations). As I pointed out, INDIVIDUALS in Greece have unrestricted civil rights and may identify as they please (ethnic, religious, sexual orientation, etc.)

They do not. They can't use their right of association to associate freely, which is not restricted by the treaty. Lausanne does not oblige the Greek state to deny members of its ""muslim"" minority the ability to associate on other dimensions. It is illegal to associate as Turks. There is a real ethnic minority in Greece, which the treaty does not deny. The treaty simply outlines a described minority group, it does not prevent people associating among subgroups or other groups.

This would be like Turkey going full islamist and calling Kurds muslims and forbidding them to associate as Kurds because they're muslims. It makes no sense.

&gt; You have to be kidding? There are Turkish language schools and mosques, publications, a Turkish consulate, unrestricted travel to Turkey, frequent visits by Turkish government representatives... what the heel do you mean they ""can't associate as an ethnic Turk""?

Can't use their right to association and form an association for ethnic Turks. Can make no demands for or as ethnic Turks openly.

&gt; Now do yourself a favor and read the Treaty of Lausanne about the status of Imbros and Tenedos. The Greeks there (mind you, that is how the treaty identifies them) are supposed to be self-governing. Instead they have been ethnically cleansed. Their schools have been closed (in contrast to those in Western Thrace). Their properties confiscated (again, do the comparison). Do you really have a leg to stand on?

I never said that they weren't. You on the other hand claimed: ""On an individual level any citizen of Greece can identify with whatever ethnic or religious group he or she chooses.""

They can not associate as a given ethnic group, especially in a politically active manner. The Greek state makes it illegal. Unless you mean ""individual level"" like this statement is also true: ""On an individual level any citizen of Turkey can identify with whatever ethnic or religious group he or she chooses.""

4135,"&gt; Lmao the only thing Trump does is ask to pay fair share,

No it's not the ""only thing he does"". One of the things he does is lying about NATO agreements in order to attacks his allies. 

The Wales Summit declaration (2014) the 2% expenditure characterises the 2% expenditure as a ""guideline"". Also, the declaration determines that for those under the 2% guideline the target date is 2024. This is the compromise. So Trump is cherry picking and decontextualising bits of information to pretend there is a commitment that does not exist.  

Furthermore Trump concludes that, because Europeans supposedly ""aren't paying their share"" the USA is being ""ripped off"". However that's nonsensical. The 2% guideline is not about ""paying a share"". This isn't some joint NATO budget. The 2% refers to  each nation's own defence budget. Increasing Europe's budget doesn't necessarily imply reducing USA's budget, nor that money will flow to the USA. 

Trump as also openly questioned the usefulness of NATO, and generally behaved in a manner that raises questions about his level of commitment to the organisation. Commitment, more than finances, are critical to the organisation's strength. It's biggest asset is art. 5 and the trust that it will be taken seriously.

All the land that you see I will give to you and your offspring forever. I will make your offspring like the dust of the earth, so that if anyone could count the dust, then your offspring could be counted. Go, walk through the length and breadth of the land, for I am giving it to you.”

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_of_Israel

&gt;The Land of Israel (Hebrew: אֶרֶץ יִשְׂרָאֵל‬, Modern Eretz Yisrael, Tiberian ʼÉreṣ Yiśrāʼēl) is the traditional Jewish name for an area of indefinite geographical extension in the Southern Levant. Related biblical, religious and historical English terms include the Land of Canaan, the Promised Land, the Holy Land, and Palestine (see also Israel (disambiguation)). The definitions of the limits of this territory vary between passages in the Hebrew Bible, with specific mentions in Genesis 15, Exodus 23, Numbers 34 and Ezekiel 47. Nine times elsewhere in the Bible, the settled land is referred as ""from Dan to Beersheba, and three times it is referred as ""from the entrance of Hamath unto the brook of Egypt” (1 Kings 8:65, 1 Chronicles 13:5 and 2 Chronicles 7:8).
&gt;
&gt;These biblical limits for the land differ from the borders of established historical Israelite and later Jewish kingdoms; over time these have included the United Kingdom of Israel, the two separated kingdoms of Israel (Samaria) and Judah, the Hasmonean Kingdom, and the Herodian Kingdom, which at their heights ruled lands with similar but not identical boundaries.
&gt;
&gt;The Jewish religious belief defining the land as where Jewish religious law prevailed and excluding territory where it was not applied,[1] holds that the area is a God-given inheritance of the Jewish people based on the Torah, particularly the books of Genesis and Exodus, as well as on the later Prophets.[2] According to the Book of Genesis, the land was first promised by God to the descendants of Abram; the text is explicit that this is a covenant between God and Abram for his descendants.[3] Abram's name was later changed to Abraham, with the promise refined to pass through his son Isaac and to the Israelites, descendants of Jacob, Abraham's grandson. This belief is not shared by most adherents of replacement theology (or supersessionism), who hold the view that the Old Testament prophecies were superseded by the coming of Jesus,[4] a view often repudiated by Christian Zionists as a theological error.[5] Evangelical Zionists variously claim that Israel has title to the land by divine right,[6] or by a theological, historical and moral grounding of attachment to the land unique to Jews (James Parkes),[7] The idea that ancient religious texts can be warrant or divine right for a modern claim has often been challenged,[8][9] and Israeli courts have rejected land claims based on religious motivations.[10]
&gt;
&gt;During the mandatory period (1920-1948) the term ""Eretz Yisrael"" or the ""Land of Israel"" was part of the official Hebrew name of Mandatory Palestine. Official Hebrew documents used the Hebrew transliteration of the word “Palestine” פלשתינה (Palestina) followed always by the two initial letters of ""Eretz Yisrael"", א״י Aleph-Yod.[11][12]
&gt;
&gt;The Land of Israel concept has been evoked by the founders of the State of Israel. It often surfaces in political debates on the status of the West Bank, which is referred to in official Israeli discourse as Judea and Samaria, from the names of the two historical Jewish kingdoms.[13]",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/92u1x6/irish_senate_passes_israeli_settlement_boycott/e38nf6m/,vokegaf,1532877658

If it's the prerequisite for being officially recognized as a ""couple"" by the local government, then preventing others from it is a pretty big limitation to their freedom. It's not like they are hurting anybody or somebody else loses out when they marry, so why the opposition?

&gt; They're widespread throughout Europe anyway, and have been for centuries.

And for centuries it's been the basis for the persecution of ""other believers"", ""sinners"", ""witches"" and whatnot if you really think that's a good example to follow, just because ""that's the way it's always been"", then I'm not sure what to tell you, except for that I truly pity you.

Perhaps not entirely subscribed to the rhetoric, but certainly supportive of the ideology to a degree. Not to mention that anti-semitism also plays a big role, in which Hungary is unfortunately the forerunner as well. 

In general Orbán gains support through a lot of means and tricks, such as the free money for all older supporters last election (if I remember this correctly) and the gigantic classic media presence as well as shifting the narrative through statements like the above. 

&gt;Also, sometimes I get the feeling that Orbán has supporters everwhere. I met Danes, Poles, Austrians, Italians, French who support him, and I even met a Swedish guy in the Netherlands who is a true fanboy.

I mean, you'll meet people like that for every leader of a political side. You'll meet plenty of western Europeans and Americans supporting Assad or even Phillipino dictator Duterte.

Landing on the Moon - Direct TV transmission

Apollo 11 - 20./21. July 1969

When April 12, 1961, Yuri Alexeyevich Gagarin, as the first person in the Earth to fly our planet, we watched his flight with astonishment from the radio reportage. Only a few years later we learned that Gagarin was already back on Earth at the time of the report. In the then Soviet Union it was doing so. Information on space flights in Moscow was published only when they were certain that the flight had succeeded. The Americans did not keep their attempts. Rocket launch reports were released even though the start failed and ended in an explosion. Soviet propaganda used it to its advantage and pointed to the unreliability of American technology.

Apollo flights were then closely monitored in Czechoslovakia. The political situation after the entry of Warsaw Pact troops into Czechoslovakia caused people to turn their attention and favor to America rather than to Moscow propaganda. The first human landing on the Moon was thus carefully monitored and tension expected.

On Czechoslovak television, however, there were people who, by their passivity, could make it impossible to broadcast live broadcasts from this event. The transfer was not ordered, nor did it count 1) . Nevertheless, the general satisfaction of the audience and the commentators who had to come to the studio unplanned 2) . How did that happen?

It was Sunday, July 20, 1969. The evening broadcast of the television program came to its conclusion. The audience learned that the expected landing on the Moon should take place in the late hours of the night ( 3), and that more detailed information on how that happened would be given the next day.

At the time, I was 29 years old and worked on the main radio station in Strahov. All the TV channels from abroad were led here. I have been the head of the operational shift. I also closely watched Apollo flights. I had the opportunity to watch the broadcasts of foreign televisions practically all day long. That day came to us pictures from Houston even when they were not broadcast here. Televisions in neighboring countries were also about to end their broadcasts. Apollo was regularly informed about the program, but such enthusiasm and interest of spectators, as it was in Czechoslovakia at the time, was not with neighbors.

The night service ended in the morning, so I watched foreign broadcasts to show something interesting. From Germany, we only received their monoscope, but pictures from the USA were coming from Vienna, where images of Apollo 11 were also coming to land on the Moon. I was determined to look at this transmission even though it will not be broadcast (or maybe because of that). Only a picture came without sound. That would be enough. I called in the Mestanske beseda to my colleagues at the linking station whether they were interested in watching at least a picture from the moon. They had interest and I have connected them to them. After a while, they began to search for the soundtrack. I did not have that. The broadcasting of our television ended, and most of the work went home. After a few minutes, my colleagues asked me to try to get the sound that someone from the editorial staff wanted him to watch.

I tried to call Nuremberg, where we usually received transmissions from the Eurovision network. But there they left me for nothing to link me because we have not ordered any transfer.

I was afraid to call in Vienna so that I could not get a picture. I tried to call my colleagues at Kamzík near Bratislava. Somehow they did it, and only the sound to transmit from Apollo was sent. They just asked me not to connect him anywhere, so they would not be in trouble. Thus, the picture and the sound were given to the Messenská beseda. Our transmitters have already been switched off. They had to switch on until the next morning before the broadcast.

Although the transfer from Apollo was not secured and was in fact stolen, the editor-in-chief, who was present at random, called the Doubek editor and other people into the studio. I thought they would just watch the transmission. Around 2 pm, he asked me if the TV transmitter could be switched on. The transmitter dispatcher first asked me the question if I did not go mad. When I explained the situation to him, he promised help and started calling on the transmitters to start the extraordinary broadcast out of schedule. Also, radio broadcasting was given information that the television will broadcast an extraordinary transmission from Apollo 11 landing to the moon.

And so this unscheduled transmission has just taken place. Today it is said to be legendary. For the entire thirty-five years, many memories have been remembered by him, and no one has ever come to see the circumstances of what he actually did. He probably did not appear in the international transport reports and no one paid a crown for him either. Officially, this transmission has never been done. The date is 20 July, but this transmission actually took place at the time when our country was already July 21, 1969, and it was already Monday 3) .

This year, there have been several programs in which this historic event of worldwide significance has been remembered. There was no interest in the circumstances of television broadcasting.

As a direct participant I realized that even this event had entered history and should not fall into oblivion.

July 2004

Ing. Zdeněk Bezouška

Notes A. Vítka

1 This is not true. Transmissions were scheduled, but during Apollo 11 there were time changes that made things more complicated. While it is true that some of the leaders were too ""cautious"" and ""alibistic"", it was then in TV News that there was enthusiasm and fervor to bring people of Czechoslovakia closer to Apollo 11. We did not have to come back, in the editorial office we spent practically all the three days Apollo 11 operated near the moon. Here Ing. Bez och's mistakes. As one of the commentators on the course of Apollo 11 on Czechoslovak Television, I must point out that the transfer from my own landing took place during the normal operation of the television, on Sunday, July 20, evening  
2 (The Eagle landed on the surface of the Moon on July 20, 1969 at 20:17:43 UT, ie 21:17:43 CET, and in 1969 there was no summer time - it was reintroduced in Czechoslovakia only in 1979). On the screen, images of the Houston Control Center alternated with us in the studio, and we had many times during a 20-minute broadcast during the descent to alert the audience with an outrageous call to television that for a technical motif they were broadcasting television for technical reasons the flight can not be possible until after the landing of astronauts to the moon's surface. When it is, we did not know; the original flight timetable assumes that astronauts will land first after the landing and the necessary checks, and then they will step out, which means early in the morning of Central European time. At that time, direct transmission was also negotiated.  
3 It was us, ing Jan Kolář and me. So far, we have watched TV News in the Čs. television in Vladislavova street, the preparation of the preparations, on the one hand, according to the agency news coming from the telex, and then also from the English broadcast of the Voice of America, and we knew that the timing had changed and that Armstrong and Aldrin were in the place of preparation for sleep. We announced this before the end of normal TV broadcast, and then editor Doubek also called Cs. radio, trying to get some direct transmission. How, it was still in the stars because it was ordered until the morning.  
4 Direct transmission from the exit to the surface of the Moon did not take place until Monday morning. The preparations were extended for about an hour against the first news, but thanks to Mr. Bezoušek, a monoscope was broadcast and if I remember, we were able to assure the spectators several times that preparations for the moon continue and that the transmission will be. Armstrong stepped out of the Eagle module at 02:39:36 UT (03:39:36 CET) and returned to it at 05:09:33 UT (06:09:33 CET). The interest in this transmission was so great, and despite the fact that a lot of people were not sleeping and having lasted all the time with the televisions, that it was broadcast from the record all the time again, I suspect in the afternoon on July 21, and in the evening television news that day was from Several longer edited shots have been repeated.

The ultimate value of Liberalism is to uphold the freedom of the individual against interference by the state, unless that interference is necessary to protect the freedom of other individuals. All the different flavours of liberalism, from libertarianism to neoliberalism to socio-liberalism, disagree mainly on three points: (1) which are those freedoms, (2) when does an individual infringe on the freedoms of others and (3) what are the tools that the state is justified in using to protect those freedoms.

On the other hand, the ultimate value of Democracy is to put power in the hands of the people. How differences of opinion are handled, how the people exercise their power, or how is it limited is down to the details.

Orban and Erdoǧan ostensibly stand for the idea that if the people vote that certain lifestyles, religions, or national identities should be suppressed, then their democratic mandate should be upheld. On the other hand, in ""the West"" we tend to believe certain individual freedoms are more important than allowing the people (or the state in their name) to collectively infringe upon them.

4534,"&gt;the public accepted Tayyip to go authoritarian because we were not good enough for the EU

Nonsense. AKP sabotaged the EU association talks and moves continously, together with their political partner, the UK who merely supported them for political gains (funny enough, this worked out for a while for both Labour and Tories). 

Austria's opposition should never have been particularly surprising, but is also insignificant. Especially Germany was instrumental in opening talks between 2002 and 2005 in the first place, the only thing that Germany then failed to do, was use their influence within the talks to push through - something that, like I pointed out before, happened due to not wanting to bet on the wrong horse with the AKP and self-sabotaging. 

Of course Erdogan and his party used such a dissapointment strategically in the political sphere. But if you follow the timeline, the illiberal approach of Erdogan as well as AKP's general shift in policy already began way before it became apparent that none of the talks would ever lead to fruitition.

I am outraged, this EU is for solidarity, we have always been net contributors, and we are surrounded by enemies. I am just astonished, I do not know what we did to deserve this contempt, but it is nothing short of astonishing. 

At least as far as I am concerned, yeah I suppose the rest of Europe has declared a 21st century style war on us, and are actually committed to our destruction. We give you structural funds, you refuse to take immigrants which i can sort of sympoathise with, and I suppose there's guys like Orban who know that NGOs and Soros exist...

I dont understand why you Easterners resent the German-French multiculti bullshit, see that we in Italy and maybe Greece do not want the migrants the German-French with LowCountries Scands are forcing onto us, and all you do is sneer! You think its funny apparently. Yet all of you expect Italy to join you in a war with Russia and to enjoy sanctioning Russia when we have had no problem with them, yet you do fundamentally expect us to participate in a war you want with them?

I don't know where I got the idea that the Easterners would be allies. I was deeply mistaken. I'm older than many of your countries, yet you already think you can pull rank? For real? 

I would have thought the East and South could have encircled the Northerners and end this migrant issue for good, meaning the EU and ECJ and others get the fuck out of our way and our territorial waters and contribute ships, money, chartered planes and manpower for the sole purpose of assuming some liability with us to deport these migrants from all over the continent and force their home countries to take their citizens back.

Instead you are fine with us being prohibited from refusing migrants, from sending them to Libya, from sending them to 'unsafe' countries, from sending them to Europe unless they are doctors or engineers while paying the entire cost of rescue and housing out of pocket while simultaneously tightening our state spending? This is a clear plan for the destruction of a society. We have marxists who did some shippng, but most migrants came from European NGOs and European naval vessels. 

Just as Saudi and Qatar are responsible for ISIS and AL Qaeda, and everyone knows it despite there not being official written contracts, the North Europeans are responsible for the migrant crisis since 2011 and they shipped most of these migrants to Italy expecting Italy to take them all. 

In 2011 the EU made a coup in Italy and we had appointed prime ministers all ex-EU commissioners and leftists who were forced by the French and Germans to take migrants, look at Macron's outrage when we finally refused, the French are particularly interested in Italy's destruction, but it seems all of you are on board.

4681,"I understand todays buildings have a better isolation, more efficient windows, roofs etc and everyone want to build for as little money as possible so we are trying to mass producing those things from the same source. The same style is nowadays being built in Europe, America, Asia, India and even Africa.

Our ancestors did not lived in front of computers and television, they lived outside, they cared about how buildings and surroundings looked like. They were proud of their culture and part of the reason why everything was so pretty was because there was competition between nations. Nowadays is everything only about money.

Most arguments for multiculturalism and diversity is that it ""enriches"" our own culture, so what is the goal ? That everything on this planet will become the perfectly same at some point ? What will be even the point of living ? Why explore and travel the world if there is nothing different anymore, living with the fact, that you cannot make a difference anywhere, that you are just insignificant useless nothing in the massive grey world. People need purpose, people need feeling that their lives have some meaning, every human need to feel special in order to be happy with himself.

Yes, nationalism have very negative sides if its pushed into extremes but it is not like feel of belonging somewhere and competition is something unnatural for humans.

Honestly, the idea of spending our short lives in some globalistic sterile future full of censorship and predefined expectations everywhere just to not hurt anyone feelings is quite displeasing for me. We are not some robots, we are human beings.

We are trying to outsmart ourselves, creating progress by some flawed rules and regulations based on current mood in society in order to function, because we need progress in order to function. But we are forgetting who we are.

What do you want, a failed state there?  Occupying it?  I mean, hell, I'm not happy with assassinations and threats and sporadic invasions and occupations and annexations of parts of (non-NATO) countries in the region.  But in the wake of the collapse, the primary US concern was nuclear civil war among the ex-members.  That was avoided.  Whatever the problems today, I assert that the outcome now is better than that; and why one of the top priorities was in reducing the number of countries running around with nukes to just Russia.

Sure, in retrospect, it's easy to feel safe and comfortable.  But at the time, the US government was moving from estatic over concessions to quite concerned about the *extent* of the collapse.

The situation was rapidly moving and quite unpredictable.  US intelligence first expected the USSR to hold together, then started worrying about collapse of nuclear weapons control.

https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/books-and-monographs/at-cold-wars-end-us-intelligence-on-the-soviet-union-and-eastern-europe-1989-1991/art-1.html

&gt;NIE 11-18-91 outlined four possible scenarios--chronic crisis; system change (with Gorbachev holding power in a more pluralistic and voluntary union of the republics); ""chaotic and violent"" fragmentation into many separate states; and regression (a coup)--without assigning probabilities. The authors did, however, agree that scenarios two and three were the most likely and that most propitious scenario for the West would be ""system change."" Fragmentation and repression would pose challenges to efforts to the end the Cold War, either because the United States would have to deal with several new states and a new kind of nuclear proliferation or because the ascendancy of hard-liners who would put the brakes on arms control and negotiations.
&gt;
&gt;The August coup in the Soviet Union and the disintegration of the center posed new problems for the US Intelligence Community. 81 The first post-coup assessment was SNIE 11-18.2-91, The Republics of the Former USSR: The Outlook for the Next Year, September 1991 (Document 10). It concluded that the ""USSR and its communist system are dead. What ultimately replaces them will not be known within the next year, but several trends are evident"" [emphasis in original]. The SNIE then spelled out three possible scenarios for the post-Soviet future, including:
&gt;
&gt;* One: Political and economic ""confederation"" in which the republics would coordinate economic, defense, and foreign policies, while continuing to pursue economic reform. Control over nuclear weapons would remain centralized, and the West could continue pursuing improved relations and arms control with the successor republics.
&gt;* Two: A ""loose association"" in which several key republics would break away but maintain a common market. Russia and several others would attempt to coordinate foreign and military policies, although a tendency to go it alone and pursue independent policies would prevail.
&gt;* Three: ""Disintegration"" and collapse of the center. Rising nationalism and continuing economic problems would pave the way for authoritarian governments in some republics. Republics would fight over operational control of nuclear weapons, and the threat of such weapons falling into terrorist hands would increase.
&gt;
&gt;The SNIE concluded that the second scenario was the most likely and the third the least likely over the coming year--three months before the final breakup. It was right and wrong at the same time. Its authors did not envision the death of the USSR and the birth of 15 new countries, although it did project that Russia would play the leading role in whatever happened next and that--if Ukraine went its own way--it would change the equation even more. One reason the drafters may not have seen what was coming was their tendency to overestimate the impact of economic problems and underestimate the impact of resurgent nationalism. It also overlooked the Yel'tsin-Gorbachev duel as a factor motivating the Russian leader to finish off his rival by finishing off the USSR, Gorbachev's last power base.

-

&gt;The good news, according to the Estimate drafters, was still the CFE Treaty, which, by reducing the risk of war in Europe, reduced the risk of nuclear war growing out of a conflict between the United States and the USSR. The Estimate nonetheless took a clear-eyed view of the new and disturbing nuclear realities in an empire facing implosion. The wild card was separatism. The center might lose control over nuclear-weapons production, R&amp;D facilities, and test sites. The rebellious republics were withholding or reducing payments to Moscow, which portended problems affecting deployment and operation of strategic forces. Ballistic missile early warning was another issue: five of the eight early-warning radar sites were located outside the Russian Republic--one of the most important was in Latvia. Then there was the looming problem of central civilian control to prevent unauthorized use by renegade military officers or nationalists. NIE 11-3/8-91 gave Soviet security measures high marks, while adding that, in the event of a military coup, collapse of the central government, or civil war, all bets were off.
&gt;
&gt;In September, President Bush announced his decision to remove or destroy all tactical nuclear weapons deployed in Europe and Asia and on US warships. He also canceled plans to deploy the mobile MX and Midgetman missiles. US bombers and missiles that were scheduled for destruction under START were taken off 24-hour alert status. 87 The President also called on the USSR to adopt additional arms control measures, including elimination of all land-based ICBMs with multiple warheads.
&gt;
&gt;Gorbachev responded by announcing his intention to dismantle all tactical nuclear weapons. (See Soviet Tactical Nuclear Forces and Gorbachev's Nuclear Pledges: Impact, Motivations, and Next Steps, November 1991 (Document 15.) He described this as ""racing downhill"" with the United States in arms control. But it also was a race against time. As President Bush noted, the international security situation had changed for the better--especially with the elimination of the threat of surprise attack in Europe--and it was time to ""seize the opportunity"" to reduce nuclear weapons further and stabilize US and Soviet forces at lower levels. 88 But the subtext, on both sides, was the looming possibility of Soviet imperial implosion and the chance that terrorists or renegade military officers might seize nuclear, particularly tactical nuclear, weapons for use in local conflicts or civil wars. (The administration's worst fear was ""Yugoslavia with nukes,"" a Soviet empire torn apart by civil war and descending into regionalism and warlordism. 89) The United States (and Gorbachev and his supporters in the USSR) wanted to reach binding agreements while there was still a central political authority in the Kremlin.
&gt;
&gt;The fate of the Soviet Union can be traced out in the title and content of NIE 11-18.3-91, November 1991 (Document 7), Civil Disorder in the Former USSR: Can It Be Managed This Winter? Some of the dire predictions had come true, and now the US Intelligence Community was rushing to assess the consequences--rather than the causes--of perestroika's failure. The impending death of the Soviet empire was raising a host of problems that exceeded the old imperial arrangements in their capacity for threatening to disrupt regional and international stability. Those problems--fragmentation of the armed forces, control over nuclear weapons and technology, ethnic tensions and open conflicts, food and fuel shortages, economic stagnation, and the high potential for domestic strife and even civil war--made some nostalgic for the empire. Nightmare scenarios, such as a clash between Russia and Ukraine, were considered. The pessimistic prediction of the ""most significant civil disorder in the former USSR since the Bolsheviks consolidated power"" fortunately did not happen.

&gt;IN THEORY slavery was completely abolished in 1981, when Mauritania became the last country to outlaw forced labour. In practice, however, it persists in many forms, some of them surprisingly blatant. In November CNN broadcast a grainy video depicting the auction of 12 migrant Nigerian men for farm work. When human trafficking and less extreme forms of coercion are included, slavery-like practices remain disturbingly common.

&gt;Modern slavery is often seen as a problem that is limited to poor countries. However, forced labour in the developing world feeds into supply chains that lead to the West. In its 2018 report on global slavery, the Walk Free Foundation, a campaign group, examined supply chains in the G20 group of large economies. Its aim was to work out which countries use which policies against exploitation. The G20 accounts for three-quarters of global trade. However, only seven of its members have rules to lower the risk that goods and services are sourced from forced labour.

4829,"&gt;whataboutism

You sound like the type of simpleton that the crony Μεταπολίτευση has created in Greece. The ""whataboutism"" is you bringing up something that has nothing to do with this topic - the period immediately after WW1. Go back to SYRIZA camp for lessons on debating.

&gt;a special event where the country had two governments.

WTF is a ""special event"" that somehow justifies inviting foreign powers to partition the country, blockade and bomb your own capital, and use them to overthrow the democratically elected government? To anyone but the brainwashed, it's called treason and not a ""special event"".

&gt;I thank God that the Entente powers toppled the stupid royalists and brought us on the right side for country for rational reasons

So you're siding with foreign countries over the elected government of Greece. And who exactly? The foreign countries that demanded Greece send troops to Ukraine to fight the Bolsheviks, and then back-stabbed Greece in Asia Minor (by signing peace treaties once they secured what they were looking for). So get on the record thanking them and that traitorous Venizelos who destroyed 5000 years of Hellenism in Asia Minor. Μπράβο πιστό παιδί της μεταπολίτευσης. Τόση μόρφωση σου έδωσαν.

&gt;A Russian turning Bolshevik doesn't strip his ethnicity, it was (mostly) Russian Bolsheviks that helped Kemal.

Now you're just pulling ""facts"" out your ass. By that time Lenin was seriously ill and Stalin (an ethnic Georgian) was running the country. FFS, he's the one the named the country USSR. Since you know about the subject, tell me who Gregory Zinoviev, Lev Kamenev, or Leon Trotsky were (as full members of the politburo at the time).

4855,"* The businesses need to be pulling down a lot of money as a prerequisite to pay that.  The article says, for example, that they need workers in construction.  I have no doubt that Polish construction companies could in theory pay that — Poland could pass a law mandating that construction wages be at least X PLN.  But the money has to come from somewhere.  That means houses costing more, stores costing more (and so prices rising to pay for that), and so on, with all these resources needing to go to attract and hold people in construction.

* No matter what, Poland still gets into long-term issues if the population declines rapidly.  Poland clearly has preference in where to pull people from.  If Poland wants to draw from the Ukrainian population rather thn the Eritrean population, fine by me, if that makes 'em happy.  Problem is, Ukraine's got her *own* serious demographic problems, and this is just kinda adding to them.  Unlike Ukraine, the Philippines are still seeing healthy growth: they can comfortably send people abroad without problems as long as that holds true.  [They had a TFR of 3.02 in 2017, and at 100 million strong, are large enough to sustain sending people over without clobbering themselves.](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2127.html)  If Poland's happy with a lot of Roman Catholics showing up and a lot of Filipinos are happy to not be off enjoying Duterte's anti-drug death squad stuff, sounds like a win-win situation.

Trust and credibility is probably the most important thing for a political union.

&gt;Europe just proceeded to sign some of the largest trade deals in history while Ukraine is still fighting.

None of which make a single difference if the populace of the political union do not trust the actual political union. You can sign trade deals with every damn country in the world, but if some countries in the union are against the union or think that it doesn't care about its interests then the union doesn't work.

&gt;And your comparison with Poland is stupid, Europe has everything to lose if Russia did something similar there.

Alright, Russia occupies a county in Estonia. Tell me what the EU loses by not going to war to Russia over losing 2 small cities compared to the Ukraine situation. The answer: trust and credibility, but according to you those don't matter at all.

4895,"&gt;Targeting ethnic minorities in the pursuit of national interests is certainly not a new phenomenon. Similar panic-mongering narratives have already emerged within the Euro-Atlantic community. However, the Hungarian government’s direct, deliberate involvement in stoking xenophobia on a national scale is not only unprecedented among European and NATO member states in the 21st century but also showcases the fragility of democratic institutions in a complex media environment that is ripe for politically motivated exploitation.

4923,"I don't know enough about EU regulations to say whether-or-not an actual violition occurred.  But I can believe that it did, or — importantly, not the same thing, as a company can reasonably be expected to push up to the limit of what regulations do permit on the matter — that if EU regulations do *not* exist, that it could make legitimate economic sense for them to do so.

The fundamental rationale for antitrust law is that market failure can occur where a monopoly exists, and that this can be limited by restricting how a company that controls a monopoly seeks to leverage that power.

If Google can substantially determine the terms on which a consumer can obtain a smartphone — not *merely* the terms on which an Android smartphone may be obtained — then it can compel the consumer to accept other things that they would not have accepted in a competitive market.

Dominance of one platform — smartphone OSes — may thus not be extended to control of browsers or search engines.  I have an Android phone, and I'm comfortable saying that Google makes it actively annoying to treat a non-Google search engine on Android as comparable, or to remove the search engine entirely.

&gt;Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai warned that Android may not remain free as a result of the EU ruling or it may shift to a tightly controlled distribution model like rival Apple Inc.

I don't see that as being a credible threat.  

(Note that I am generally much happier with Google than Apple and consider them to be a refreshingly-open company that makes quite good products.  But nobody's standard for antitrust is ""refreshingly-open"".)

First, Apple avoids penalties here, true.  But that is not because they are highly restrictive.  It is because they have limited market share (though perhaps some of Google's market share is *because* they are more-open.)  Google becoming more restrictive would do nothing to improve its legal situation today.

Second, ""bundling OS and browser producing EU antitrust complaints"" should not be a surprise as a risk, since Microsoft went through this *same* OS-browser penalty and unbundling process in the EU.

Third, Google ""closing up"" the way Apple does may *expose* it to additional penalties because of the higher bar that they must meet, as the overwhelmingly-dominant player.  For example, Google permits third party app stores; Apple does not.  Apple has actively used its control over its app store to block ability of application vendors to produce competing products to Apple apps.  It's a good bet that Google doing the same thing would get Google in trouble.

Note here that I actually think that there might be room for creation of an entirely new form of law, an extension of antitrust law: additional higher standards for avoiding anti-competitive behavior where lock-in exists.

The idea behind a monopoly player seeing antitrust restrictions is that they can substantially determine the terms on which a consumer may obtain a product.

In the case of smartphones, both Apple and Google have worked hard to ""lock"" a user into their ecosystem.  Every dollar that a user spends further locks them into the Apple or Google ecosystem, since all that software goes away if a user attempts to switch. Further, all of their years of interface familiarity with software goes away.  What really exists now is two *separate* markets, each controlled by a single monopoly.  There is not a single market in which one may easily switch.  And on top of that, app stores act as *services* with non-transferrable goods, which allows them to effectively defeat the [first-sale doctrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-sale_doctrine).  That means I can't even sell back what I've purchased to recoup some of my losses on now-unusable products if I switch.

Such is the prize for becoming a platform provider.  Everyone wants to be a platform provider.

This is not specific to tech companies — it is a widespread issue in many markets.  If I make a product with attachments and accessories that I sell separately and use patents (nobody else can make exactly this sort of farm equipment coupling) or trade secrets or access to services to inhibit competition and place a competitor on anything other than a level playing field in purchasing interoperable products, then I am creating many such ""tiny markets"", and in each of them, I am a monopoly provider.

I believe that there is still policy work to be done here to produce more-efficient markets.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/92qzxy/dont_really_see_eus_argument_over_google/e37wqr6/,vokegaf,1532833825

Says a guy that is praising Venizelos. But alas, keep proving what a parrot the education system of Greece has created.

And then you miss the obvious in the content you decided to quote:

The positions that follow (ΠτΔ, Πρωθυπουργό, την Κυβέρνηση ή τη Βουλή) are those that exercise (ασκεί) the powers that stem from the decision of the people. The act of treason is against the democratic system (and thus the country &amp; constitution), not the government in place.

And you said (just to remind you):

&gt;Anyone who attempts to topple a government is a traitor to that government, **Venizelos was a traitor to Athenian Constantinist government**

No, he was simply a traitor (and not only did he overthrow the government, he used foreign forces to do so). And yet the ""democrats"" in Athens praise him.

4934,"GMO are not the revolution you are thinking of, I've read the studies on the Monsanto website (so presumably the ones put them in the best light), they say it provides a maximum of 5% productivity increase (sometimes less depending of the type of crops).


Food is already incredibly cheap after decades of industrialisation. Even if this cost saving is fully past onto customers, that's going to be a maximum of 5% of that 10% budget, so around 5€/month saving for a minimum salary, probably around 3€/month in reality accounting for other types of crops and market deficiencies.

How much is it worth to put for a marketing campaign to save people 3€/month? Is it not worth putting this money to solve the housing crisis? Any change in that area is a massive change for the minimum salary.


The marketing campaign in the EU to change the perspective would easily cost billions. The public opinion is extremely negative and Monsanto PR is about the same as the Nazis (I'm serious).

So to conclude, I don't think there's any scenario where GMO are worth it in the EU, at best you are going to spend billions on it on PR and won't be worth it, at worst it will threaten the entire union (and it's certainly not worth taking that risk).",Lorraine (France),/r/europe/comments/92fvji/europe_applies_strict_regulations_to_crispr_crops/e37x0al/,realusername42,1532834151

When he ousted Venizelos in 1915 [he telegraphed to Wilhelm](https://youtu.be/TgcqCNlbRGs?t=1342), ""I got rid of Venizelos"". Stupid royals being stupid royals as always, bringing misery to the countries.

I said that yes, by definition that is treachery but I consider it a nation saving ""treachery"", same ""treachery"" as if foreign powers helped topple the stupid military junta of 1967.

4992,"&gt; GMO are not the revolution you are thinking of, I've read the studies on the Monsanto website (so presumably the ones put them in the best light), they say it provides a maximum of 5% productivity increase (sometimes less depending of the type of crops).

Monsanto is not the end-all-and-be-all of genetic engineering.  They are simply an early player that sell some seeds that have disease resistance and pesiticide resistance — it's like reducing, say, use of electricity to replacing gas lighting with electric lighting, which is what early companies in the electrical field did.  Not that that's bad, but it's a very small portion of what access to electrical power has done in society, and it's not what I expect genetic engineering to do.

But as each development is produced, that gap grows; it becomes no smaller.

The [Green Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Revolution) depended in good part on just a small change from Norman Borlaug — using artifical selection to induce dwarfism in wheat, which permitted yields to rise by 60%.  That is a very primitive change.  Do you believe this exceeds anything else that can be done?

What if I produce a single plant form factor that is easy to automatically harvest and then cause all foods to be grown in that factor, attacking the automated food harvesting problem on the biological rather than robotic side?  What if I produce bruise-resistant skins for things like pineapple guavas, making them amenable to long-distance sale?  What if I ake plants that can distribute water themselves feom a central point via runners, avoiding the need to build and maintain irrigation systems. There's no technical reason why any of this cannot be done, and I expect it to happen at some point.

And what I'm talking about isn't the direct cost of choosing to use or not use genetically-engineered crops.  That, after all, can be relatively-easily changed.  Just flip the law if the gap becomes large enough, and I expect producers to rapidly respond.  Maybe it's not a good idea to resteict GMOs there, but any harm caused can be easily cut off.

Rather, it's the cost of not developing the biotechnology sector, being someone who creates rather than simply uses the created organisms.  It's been a common complaint that Silicon Valley is ""sticky"", hard to replicate elsewhere (including in the US, mind).  Inertia creates industrial centers for finance, for movie-making, for software, and if one *doesn't* have one, it can take some doing to create one.  Why is London the financial center that it is?  Why isn't, say, some other city, town, or village in the UK?  After all, finance is a [tertiary sector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_sector_of_the_economy) industry.  I can, in theory, operate it anywhere.  Because, I'd say, there's something of a self-perpetuating ecosystem among the support industries and in industries that use it that cannot be moved overnight.  Businesses go there because they have a skilled workforce; skilled workers go there because they have a large pool of employers.  Obviously, given sufficient pressure, it *can* be overcome.  But…I think that I would try to *encourage* this sort of thing when it's still embryonic, not discourage it.

&gt; So to conclude, I don't think there's any scenario where GMO are worth it in the EU, at best you are going to spend billions on it on PR and won't be worth it, at worst it will threaten the entire union (and it's certainly not worth taking that risk).

Well, certainly the cost of the EU breaking up would be considerable.  I'm a bit dubious that it cannot be achieved without serious risk of that, but I suppose that giving great weight to that is important.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/92fvji/europe_applies_strict_regulations_to_crispr_crops/e3802sq/,vokegaf,1532838084

That sentence means that soy beans is a part of what I'm talking about, it's still included. I used soy beans as a spring board to relate it to a more general statement.

It's also not because Europe is ""unscientific"", as you clearly believe, but because of lacking scientific research on the impacts of eating GMO soy beans. There hasn't been done extensive enough research on the topic to know exactly what these genetically altered soy beans will do to humans, if they consume them, especially not long term effects.

Furthermore, these GMO soy beans have proven to demand about as much pesticide, and the pesticides are quite often unique versions that were created specifically for a specific GMO product, and these unique pesticides are once again not as known or tested.

So this isn't just ""unscientific"" lunacy in Europe that is the reason that GMO soy beans are illegal for human consumption, but the fact that they is a general lack of knowledge regarding the effects on humans, scientifically speaking.

5059,"&gt; Because Germany was in a worse state than they were, even without US troops. 

Lol, no. Germany had superior numbers, superior demographics, secured favorable peace with the Russians and managed to win last major offensive that didn't have large American involvement on the ground. Which part of that makes you think it was a worse position than the Allies that were desperately running out of people who could hold a weapon. 

&gt;They would become a big deal. The war wouldn't be over in 1917, it would certainly last as long as did in our time, possibly more.

It took 2 million of American troops to break the stalemate despite food shortages. Ask yourself a question, what makes a bigger difference - 2 million strong army joining one of the sides, or the fact that the other side occasionally had a lighter breakfast.

&gt;Not really.

Yes really.

&gt;You're comparing two countries. Germany had AH, the Ottomans and Bulgaria on it's side, France also had Britain, and its colonial empire, Serbia, Italy, Greece, Romania, the Arabs in revolt.

I'm comparing the numbers available on the front that tied up most of the forces. Once France collapses - and it would - there's a 200 German and AH divisions available to crush anyone else left standing.  

&gt;Again, no. This was a war that was in going against the CP's from the very start

At no point until Americans joined the war was going against the Central Powers. Central Powers won in the Eastern Front, while no enemy soldier as much as set a foot on German land on the Western front and while Turks bled Allies dry at Gallipoli. Your ignorance is simply monumental. 

&gt;Again no, more so the other way around. Again no, more so the other way around. But hey, if you wanna believe that good ole Murica saved Europe once more feel free to.

Constantly repeating your misinformed opinions won't make them magically make sense, pal. The Allies were hopeless. The Americans saved them from certain defeat. That's all there is to it.

5061,"Well, I suppose that it's really a marketing question: just like affecting consumer preference on anything else.  If it can be done with [diamond wedding rings as a tradition](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1982/02/have-you-ever-tried-to-sell-a-diamond/304575/), then it can probably be done with anything.

If the EU produces an estimate of what this will cost the EU over a given time period, they know how much it's worth spending on marketing efforts.  And then it's just a matter of working out arrangements with Publicis Groupe or some other marketing agency.  They have to go figure out what it is that inhibits concerns and work up a campaign that will work in different environments.

I'm unlikely to be able to suggest anything specific there, as I'm not n expert in marketing, and in any event, it probably depends a good deal on understanding of local concerns.

When I first became aware of the EU split on GMOs, I did what I think many Americans do: assumed that it was the result of protectionist marketing campaigns driven not by the biotech industry, but by *farmers groups* looking for a way to block foreign competition.  You can see this sort of thing in the US over workers upset about foreign manufacturing (""Don't buy cheap Japanese junk"" decades back, later becoming ""Don't buy cheap Chinese junk"").

Then I read [a CFR paper](https://www.cfr.org/report/regulation-gmos-europe-and-united-states) that looked at this as resulting from government policy unique to the EU states coming together (multiple parallel regulatory systems with access to one market) combined with a very unfortunate timing of several food scandals (mad cow disease, in particular, occurring despite government assurances of safety) just before before GMOs became visible to the public eye.  It also examined the positions of European food producer associations and found that, in fact, they generally were fine with GMOs, and did not see a financial benefit, from their restriction, discounting the protectionist theory.  This is a good fifteen years old now, and there may be more-recent work on the matter (and this may not even be the most comprehensive work on the matter; it was of interest to me because it provided a view accessible to an American audience).  However, it's the best starting point that I can name off-the-cuff.

Finally, GMO/organic labeling efforts, at least here in the US, are predominantly a [marketing exercise by industry to permit selling a higher-premium form of the food](http://www.hoards.com/sites/default/files/Academics-Review_Organic-Marketing-Report.pdf).  That cannot be the same thing as GMO bans in the EU, as they produce an incompatible economic effect.  *Certification*, as in the US, permits for [market segmentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_segmentation).  If I can make use of [price discrimination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_discrimination) via product versioning, I can transform [consumer surplus into producer surplus](https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/glossary/consumer-surplus/).  This transfers wealth from the consumer to the producer.  But that only works if both versions of the product (""organic"" *and* genetically-engineered) can be made available.  That does not work if there is a blanket ban, as in the EU.  I don't know the business rationale for industry in the EU that lobbies against permitting GMOs.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/92fvji/europe_applies_strict_regulations_to_crispr_crops/e37s64y/,vokegaf,1532828467

Since we got Rouhani there was a massive push for moderation, but Israel is actively working against this and turning Iranians on each other by targeting the economy, the moderates are losing ground to the hardliners because of Israel and Trump, this will only make matters worse for everyone.


We will rid ourselves of the ayatollah eventually, but this change has to come from within, not from the outside or Iran and all the neighboring ME will end up being a mass grave.


&amp;nbsp;




&gt;you act like MEK doesn’t have support from regular Iranians though, which is wrong, I’ve personally met lots of them that support MEK and rightly so honestly

The only supporters are the communists who allied themselves with the ayatollah to push out the shah and then found themselves hanged by the ayatollah when they were no longer needed.

They are nothing but opportunistic scum, they sided with Saddam during the war for fuck's sake.

&gt;Europe, that’s where alot of people tend to flee to yes, I also have to mention here that most European governments support the US militarily through the coalition and all that, not a reason to suffer from refugees ofcourse, no country should, but it happens

And in the long term this will be their undoing, they are losing to the anti-EU propagandists because of the refugees , which are a consequence of their poorly placed support for the US... and the Saudi $$$$$$.

They could, it would just take weeks. They would have to be mobilised and then shipped out in force.

And thats assuming russia would be doing everyone the favour of actually attacking Poland first, which obviously wouldn't happen. They'd attack Estonia first.

5156,"&gt;I see no killings of civilians or military by Italians, do you? sorties could be scouting, refueling, and recon. We are allies after all, even if you are absolute shit at being allies.

I do. And you were telling me I lack comprehensive reading :). This is about strike sorties. In other words: bombing runs or strikes with the aim of bombing. No ""patrols/scouting/refueling"".

I'll repeat what I said previously:

So... finally enough to get you to admit you guys weren't saints either?

&gt;If we're not allowed to deport people, and we're not allowed to decide who comes in or not, of course some people get citizenship

Some? 40% is some? Pfft.... look at yourself for a second. Anyway, the point you are conveniently ignoring here is that Italy clearly doesn't mind accepting migrants as much as you pretend it does. It could have declined each, and it is an Italian decision not to.

You are allowed to deport/decide who comes just as much as any other European country as we are all signed to the same treaties (made post WW2 in response to German migration streams). Nobody made those treaties in order to fuck over Italy 60 years later or they'd be literal prophets.

The idea of processing asylum claims in the country of arrival is a sound and logical one in my opinion, but only if the distribution that follows is mandatory and fair. You can blame Eastern Europe for the failure, most people here were for it till we realised it meant *everyone* would come here rather than a fair distribution and steps to counter people who move after being assigned a country.

&gt;If we reject their claim its illegal to deport them, so they stay and go north, until they get caught and sent back.

No? It's just impossible. Those fuckers threw away their passport and pretend they are gay/criminals which means they'd be killed/tortured if they were sent back. It's impossible due to UN rules and everyone hates those for that reason. We have the same exact problem with sending rejected fuckheads back. Once again: it's not anti-Italy specifically. It's not all about you guys. Takes months to expel them following proper procedure and if we don't you get shit and fines with the UN.

For the last time: I'm not arguing the migration system is good or fair. I'm arguing it isn't anti-Italian but anti-European. You are directing your anger at the wrong things by blaming ""Northwestern Europe"".

&gt;I hope the Russians roll over all of you, all I will do is laugh.

I noticed. It's amusing how you state I am betraying Italy even though I want the amount of migrants in Italy as low as possible and have zero desire to see it suffer. Meanwhile you are wishing for the destruction of my country and relish the though. Wonder who the traitor here is. Maybe some ""Belgian marxists"" are, but you are just the same.

&amp;nbsp;



Yes, Russia and Iran are on the opposing side of the ME conflict but the entire refugee crisis is to blame on the USA SA Israel triangle. Yet it is the Europeans that are taking in the refugees.


&amp;nbsp;



Two times in recent history Netanyahu convinced the world that it will be a better place if they topple a regime. Once with Iraq and again with Libya. Weapons of mass destruction never found and the damaged caused created the perfect conditions for spawning Isis and the migrant crisis through Libya.


&amp;nbsp;



Now Bibi is doing the same thing with Iran. He convinced Trump to back out of the deal and are trying to escalate a conflict by any means. This has caused immense political pressure against Rouhani and his moderates in Iran.

USA is literally planning to support MEK(islamic marxists) against the current government. They don't care about the people of Iran, all they want is infighting to weaken the country so they can have dominance over the ME along with Israel and their Saudi masters.

1: The US elects a fascist that decides to take over the world.

2: The EU combines and elects a fascist that tries to take over the world.

3: Russia decides to take over the world.

4: China decides to take over the world.

Threat #2 is the most unlikelist, #2 and #4 wouldn't invade Canada until much later, #3 is much more likely to go for Canada last, and - most importantly - all but #1 would be potentially beatable. In contrast, if the US turns rogue, it'd *immediately* go for Canada and Canada wouldn't stand a chance.

And the argument against it is, what, that it'd be unlikely that the ""That couldn't happen here"" talk is actually wrong?

5291,"&gt; the EU is NOT an actor which independently decides to do things such as cutting the budget or spending more money.

Of course, that has to be agreed upon by the Council (presumably by unanimity in this instance).

&gt; the EU [..] is [..] a set of rules and a machinery of government

Yes, and those rules include the latitude for the Council to decide to revise the MFF mid term should exigent need arise.  I'll restate MFFR Art. 17 ¶5, this time by quoting it:

&gt;&gt;&gt; Any revision of the MFF in accordance with paragraph 1 shall maintain an appropriate relationship between commitments and payments.

There is an explicit obligation upon the Council to live within its means when exercising Art. 17 and therefore (IMO) an implicit obligation to invoke Art. 17 should the situation materially and substantially change from when the MFF was approved.

&gt; These general purposes of the European Union were mostly decided at its start and defined in the Treaty of Rome of 1957.

That's true in part and arguable in part.  [Rome](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:12002E/TXT&amp;from=EN) never said anything about political union.  (That's the Nice consolidated version, but the [original text](http://www.hri.org/docs/Rome57/Rome57.txt) is the same in this respect but less well formatted.)  The word 'closer' appears exactly twice in the whole text, once in the recitals:

&gt;&gt;&gt; DETERMINED to lay the foundations of an ever closer union among the peoples of Europe,

which is aspirational rather than law, and once in Art. 99(3) (Art. 103(3) in the original):

&gt;&gt;&gt; 3\. In order to ensure closer coordination of economic policies and sustained convergence of the economic performances of the Member States

with repeated emphasis on 'economic'.  In context, it's arguable that the UK signed up for anything other than *economic* relations, viz. trade, but Maastricht and Lisbon in particular centralised powers well outside the scope of trade relations including domestic and foreign affairs.  The EU didn't even become a legal entity in its own right until Lisbon came into effect in 2009.

&gt; All of these were then also what the UK and consciously signed up for in 1973 (if the UK had thought maintaining its own agricultural policy was so important, it shouldn’t have joined the EU).

It didn't.  It joined the EEC which became the EU in '93.  Arguably, the UK should not have ratified Maastricht, and I'm inclined to agree in retrospect if only because the € proved to be a terrible idea.  We should have stayed in what would become the EEA in '94.

Regardless, the CAP was not part of Rome and came into being in '62 (yes, predating the UK's accession) which is how Thatcher negotiated the rebate in the '80s.  Had the UK been part of the EEC then, it would probably have vetoed the CAP.

&gt; To achieve these purposes, the member states created a number of supranational institutions designed to fulfil particular functions

That elides quite a lot of history and development, and it implies that the UK acceded to the EEC with those institutions in place and with the remit they now have, which is not true.  The ECB which you mentioned, for instance, didn't exist until '98.  Moreover, the process of decision making used to be almost exclusively by unanimity, and national veto was gradually eroded over time.

&gt; the long term budget (MFF) is codified into law through a regulation [...] which to become law requires the initiative of the Commission which submits the initial proposal, and approval of the European Parliament and the member states as represented in the Council.

The MFF itself is a Council regulation (see the title of the regulation I linked earlier and also [the Council's description](http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/multiannual-financial-framework/)) that did not exist prior to 2007.  It does not come from the Commission and therefore doesn't follow the usual EU legislative process (although the MFF does require EP's consent, but by a different procedural path from Commission regulation and directives).

&gt; The MFF is therefore agreed in a process involving the Commission

Doubtless the Commission has input, but it doesn't formally involve the Commission (according to the Council).

&gt; The yearly budgetary procedure

Annual budgets aren't the problem here, the MFF is.

&gt; within the ceilings set by the MFF

Note that ceilings aren't commitments or minima.

&gt; it is a quasi-governmental institution which does not have to obey the laws of the market

Try telling the sovereign bond markets that governments don't have to obey emergent market laws!  The EU can get away with ignoring the markets because it does not (cannot, yet) itself borrow by issuing bonds.  Instead, it relies on member states to raise the money on its behalf.

You've missed my point: member state governments and businesses alike can't spend precisely as they please.  The constraints involved are not the same, but they are both constrained nevertheless.  If member states must impose austerity budgets, why should the Council not cut the MFF in what can only be described as extraordinary and unprecedented circumstances?

What privileges the institutions of the EU which, as you say, (supposedly) represent the interests of its member states not to have regard for its income when setting annual budgets?  In what way does failing to adapt serve member states' interests if it means raising budget contributions?

How does attempting to coerce extra money out of a *current* but soon-to-be-ex member state represent member states' interests in the long term?  Who'll be next to take one for the collective?  And if the UK ceases to benefit from EU membership or be included amongst those interests the EU nominally represents, why should the EU continue to expect budget contributions?

The solution would seem to be simple enough: either extend membership benefits and obligations (primarily but not exclusively the single market) for as long as it wants budget contributions, or revise the MFF if it does not wish to extend membership benefits.

The Council had a choice, but that choice does not include the *expectation* that the UK contributes after it has left the Union unless negotiated otherwise.  But negotiation means getting something in return which is why Raab is now saying that the exit cheque is contingent on conclusion of a withdrawal agreement.  (Raab goes further than perhaps is warranted, but I interpret that as negotiation rhetoric.)

&gt; but only the law as written in the Treaties and any of the laws flowing from that.

Part of governance is doing what is prudent and responsible, not merely what the law allows it to.

&gt; (one of these economic realities is that the UK is going to be well and truly fucked for quite a while if it leaves the EU without a deal).

Perhaps so, but the EU itself doesn't create the single market, the member states do.  The EU *regulates* that single market, but it doesn't create demand.  Businesses and consumers do that.  You credit the EU with a bit too much power by suggesting that economic realities are created by the EU itself.  If that were so, the ECB wouldn't have had to bend a great many rules in order to put the brakes on the 2009 crisis.

&gt; But ultimately, if the EU enters into a situation where it has less income, the way to address it should not be decided by some convenient economic theory that says the EU should ‘live within its means’ or something like that, but through a democratic decision

Here's where it boils down to a matter of perspective, much as conventional left vs right politics as played out in its various forms across the world: some believe that the state should be fiscally prudent, others believe that the state can and should borrow and tax to fund political objectives.

The problem is that politicians and demos are not the only actors involved: there is also the market which (though it makes no more sense to refer to it in the singular any more than it does the EU) also has an opinion on such matters.  For a time, states can borrow profligately but, sooner or later, markets will decide that the risk is too great and states that are economically irresponsible soon find themselves in deep, deep trouble.

I don't have the slide to hand but Greece's borrowing going into the 2009 crisis was actually fairly flat.  What made things turn sour was Greece's inability to service its debt followed by austerity policy that shrank the economy, increasing Greece's debt:GDP and decreasing its ability to service that debt even further.

&gt; Whether the outcome of that process ( or indeed that process not happening at all because member states think existing commitments should be abided by) is convenient or not for the UK can have no bearing on its outcome.

If the MFF is purely a political matter and the EU's spending plans are not subject to economic or market forces then, convenient or not for the EU, the EU can solve its own budgetary challenges without the UK.  Indeed, by that reasoning, the UK *cannot* have any significant influence on those challenges.

There is no question that the UK would pay its budget contributions up until it leaves the EU but, as has been pointed out before, obligations come with rights and if the UK has no rights vis-à-vis the EU or SM then it has no reciprocal obligations.

It is not good enough to say that the UK's failure to veto the current MFF in 2013 obliges the UK to fund that decision past the point where it would benefit from it, especially not when the EU had the means and opportunity to amend its spending plans well long before its income reduced.

If there were no such mechanism in the rules, then I actually could see an argument that there is some obligation.  But that is not the case, not any more than the fiction that the EU is somehow decoupled from the actual economic or political realities of Europe true.

Basically, Atatürk and his party were very concerned about the overly independent Non-Muslim Private schools and finally bound them into the Ministry of Education, how do you think Greek nationalist doctrine gained so much popularity?)

On equality, by this time; they were completely equal. What could the Turks do that Greeks couldn't? Even jizya was abolished by this time, which Sharia law requires. One side gives up the requirement of their religion for the other side, what is this if not a huge compromise in favor of an equal state? Like I've said, it's pretty much a given at this point that Christian minorities (with the exception of Armenians) were at a better position than Turks. It's mostly because Turks were stereotypically uneducated and poor. This causes hate against Greeks too but Ottomans' economic structure favored the rich.

And primacy is not anyone or any group deserves. Primacy would of course belong to the Turks because they are the majority, what do you expect? Even in Greek majority towns, the Vilayet was majority Turkish. İstanbul was definitely majority Turkish. As was İzmir. Greeks had no right to throw out the majority. 

Also, history doesn't matter here. I reject to use history for nationalist purposes. I reject to justify any action for whatever some people did 400 years prior. I did not do that, you weren't affected by that; it's irrelevant. Besides, if they had not happened; you and I would most likely not be born as butterfly effect. So we have no right to justify actions based on them. ""Your grandfathers raped my grandfathers, so you're to blame"" how Neanderthal does that sound? Yes, my grandfathers did not give rights to your grandfathers but I'll give them to you. Not to even things out for the past but because I want a sustainable and moral society. ""But historically your grandfathers were evil"" is not a counter argument to that! 

And I must respond to another issue, conquest was a completely legal way of obtaining land. Anatolia and İstanbul were legally and justly Ottoman soil from an international law perspective. If we're going to argue about 1400s, we must descend to the mindset of a regular person from 1400s and those people thought conquest was legal and justified. As a matter of fact, conquest stopped being internationally acceptable with the establishment of UN (1949). Otherwise we would have to discuss how wrong the Roman conquests were and literally nobody does that. Everybody tried their hand on conquest from the beginning until 1949 (Nazis, Napoleon, Soviets, Brits, Austro-Hungarians, Papacy, Alexander, U.S. etc.). Even states today try it- see Crimea and Cyprus. It's not relevant to today unless it happened directly to Greeks. 

We're mainly judging those times according to our values but I'm doing this because this kind of nationalism is prevalent even now. Some idiots in Turkey were happy about the fires in Greece because ""They invaded us 100 years ago"" see how stupid this sounds?


&gt;It was forbidden for Christians to ride horses for centuries, to own land that casts shade on a Muslim's house, forbidden from building and rebuilding churches, and a ton of other weird laws. Besides the fact that in Sharia a Christian's word doesn't count? There was something about actual trials I cbf to look up right now.

These arguments should die out. I mean, okay, it makes sense if you're a nationalist Greek in those times but rationally thinking, it makes no sense because of the things I've mentioned above. They **used** to be second class is literally my entire argument.

5478,"That is not entirely true. 

But short story is Norway was hit hard by the plague and it somehow ended up as the weak price that Sweden and Denmark fought over. And boy did they fight. A state of never ending war interrupted by peace existed between Denmark and Sweden for 350 years. The trouble is population, food production and resources. In the beginning the strong central powers of these nations had an advance over more divided territories of Europe, but as European nations coalesced to stronger units the low population countries up north struggled. The cost of military put a large strain on the economy and they sort of crashed into backwater forgotten neglected no one wants this kingdoms.

That is except for Denmark. It was a lot smaller, and had a strategic choke point location. Problem was it was geographically indefensible and there was no resources worth stealing. So to the greater powers of Europe a weak independent Denmark posed no threat and bothered no one. But if it was conquered by a stronger power the others would have to react. 

So tl dr. 

In the 18 hundreds a low population and not enough food plus losing the race for dominance cost Norway Sweden (mass emigration to USA followed)

Denmark small, protected by stronger powers, enough food and somehow being left alone for decades meant agricultural reforms had time to be enforced and a stable society emerge.

This line mantle of civilisation thinking where there is an concept of ""Eternal West"" which produces, which is ever-projecting and which is never-influenced that which has been always have been in forefront of progress hasn't been relevant for a while now. 

The concept of ""West"" today has been built in exclusion, where the aspects of what's West has been drawn as an outlier to what could be considered ""all else"". For example Levant has been a huge influence of concept of European philosophy or Achaemenid Empire which has been also basis for a lot of concepts of state-structure in Europe, as well as all those that influenced Ancient Greece in Eastern Mediterranean and in turn were influenced by Greece were erased in this thought. They were excluded in effect, while their ""contributions"" has been absorbed as ""inherently west"".

So Eternal West as a concept is infallible, because it's all that is positive of progress in Western Eurasia, while also rejecting and excluding all that it has interacted from having an impact on it. It's at once all what's now considered positive of Europe, and all what's considered negative projected outside. 

What you argue for moreover is rejected by Western enlightenment thinkers themselves, who looked to other countries for various concepts of progress, such as Voltaire's argument for religious tolerance and showing Ottoman Empire as an example, again despite being against Islam. 

In other fronts Western thinkers wrote of Ottoman Empire for example in such: Fanny Janet Blunt, who lived for twenty years in the Ottoman Empire, wrote that “should a lady possess any property the husband cannot assume any right over it, nor over any of the rest of her belongings. The wisdom and generosity of this ... cannot be too highly commended”.

Either way, to me it looks as if that's the mosque as seen from about North-East (i.e., looking towards about 240°-245°). That would be from the other side of the shore, somewhere south of Kız Kulesi / Maiden's Tower.

It was evidence given to the committee in person by [Francisco de Borja Lasheras](https://borjalasheras.com/sobre-mi/), a Spanish academic. He doesn't provide any evidence but refers to an ""ongoing discussion"". [The exchange was:](http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evidencedocument/digital-culture-media-and-sport-committee/fake-news/oral/74926.html)

&gt;**Paul Farrelly:**  I understand the capabilities out there; I am just trying to make a  distinction. It is out there, but to what extent do the actions of the  main protagonists actually fuel that? What effect do the actions of  Sputnik and these people have compared with—I was talking about a  comparator—the content shared as news around the world by the BBC? That  is my point. Should we get a balance between the real-world effects—even  though they are close and personal to you—of what these people are  doing compared with the actions that give rise to what they are  exaggerating? I will stop there. I was in Catalonia in the summer and in  Languedoc on the other side, and I am no supporter of Catalonian  independence.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Chair:**  I think Paul’s point is clear. The witnesses were trying to make the  point that we are potentially comparing real news, whether you agree with it or not, and fake news that is being created to spread  disinformation deliberately. Did you have a point on that?  
&gt;  
&gt;***Francisco de Borja Lasheras:***  Yes, the question of impact is something we are trying to learn about.  It is not only limited to Spain. What I will say tentatively is that in  encounters where you see such a multifaceted crisis with different and  nasty things, these operations help to further polarise a discussion  that is already polarised. External actors were not needed to polarise  the discussion, but they contribute by further polarising it.   
&gt;  
&gt;You  mentioned the BBC, but there is an ongoing discussion—I am not a  journalist, but I work with journalists—about the fulfilment of  journalistic standards and the use of quotes without attribution. **There  was talk of 900 people injured in Catalonia, but that never happened.**   
&gt;  
&gt;I  take your point. I think this is something that we are still learning,  but the disinformation campaigns further polarise and further strengthen  the different echo chambers. In Catalonia, there are different echo  chambers with competing narratives on who is democratic. You see that  they are perhaps replicated elsewhere in Europe in politically active  segments of society. I am talking about not only public opinion, but  people with views who, in a way, see those views confirmed or  strengthened and are not provided with a more pluralistic view where  there is no black and white. Those sectors tend to be the target of this  disinformation operation—not just the average, public opinion folk.   
&gt;  
&gt;In  my country there are fringe parties in the European Parliament, and  also mainstream parties, that borrow their opinions of course from the  BBC, but also from RT. Do you know what I mean? I think it does further  polarise. The actions of the different actors were open to criticism  from different sources, and it makes things even more complicated  because it fans the embers of conflicts and then internationally you  have the ongoing geo-political conflict, but domestically we have very  serious issues in our societies.

I'm no Putin lover but this is an incredibly absurd claim.

They can use Spanish which, I'm told, is widely spoken in Catalonia.

And they can use English as well. Because the claim of ""meddling"" is never made exclusive to the region. It also implies spreading misinformation *elsewhere* with the intent to create perceptions on the issue in places other than Catalonia. It can target non-Catalan Spaniards, as well as other European citizens.

What language was the ""help Catalonia"" video filmed in anyway?: English. Why?: because politics, and propaganda don't necessarily always target the local population.

In time, we will see how far reaching the Russian influence was. So far we have little to go by; the claim is that:

5684,"While you're generally right, I think you're looking at the whole ordeal too technical. You shouldn't think of Greeks as people solely identifying with their Greek roots. These are people, at its core. Their best friends, business partners are Turkish. Do not make the mistake of thinking politics decided personal lives back then. Because we tend to think like that since we live in mostly homogenous societies. 

If you dig into public life what you see will show you that Turks and Greeks, Armenians, Jews lived together in big cities with mutual acquaintances. How would you feel if your best friend flew invading colors?  

Like I've said, Atatürk was from Thessaloniki, he is probably one of the most heartbroken people about this. In occasions he said that Greeks were always wealthy in Ottoman Empire, they had freedom to practice their religion (talking about recent history of course, post 1821- and don't forget I'm talking in the context of late 1910s and early 1920s) and speak their language. They had their private schools even, Atatürk tells that they taught Ottoman Greeks Greek nationalism in these schools, even. These private schools on occasions did not even teach Ottoman history. He argues that the Empire was their homeland. Not Greece. They were wealthy in the Empire, they had freedom with the latest developments in the Empire such as the ""Imperial Reform Edict"" of 1856. They were in the parliament. Yes, more should have been done but their lives were not absolute shit and it was in fact generally better than Turks. Despite all this, they did not feel like they were part of the Empire. Until of course the national movement of Turks.

This whole thing was an expansionist dream for Greeks and Greeks to this day regret all they have done in the process of 1919-1922. ",Subhuman,/r/europe/comments/92kbu6/the_greeks_of_constantinople_welcome_the_entente/e36mx2l/,creamyrecep,1532783705
5685,"Europe wasn't that rich or powerful prior to the late 18th century. Like Europeans of the day even commented on this, Adam Smith talked about how vastly more wealth China contained than any single European nation. Prior to industrialization, national wealth was determined by a fairly simple set of criteria. Most people lived only somewhat about subsistence. The formula for having a lot of national wealth was to have a lot of people, a lot of land, stable government, low amounts of crime and banditry, low amounts of warfare, and the ability to either produce a variety of goods or trade for them. Hence the wealthiest nations of the era were large, multi-ethnic agrarian empire encompassing a number of major trading urban centers and able to quell the military threat of traditionally nomadic peoples on the margins of empire (which was accomplished in large part because the ruling families of the day largely came from such peoples, as is the case with the Ottomans, Mughals, and Qing.)  


Anyway, prior to Industrialization, Europe was really only able to colonize the Americas, and that largely because the vast majority of the indigenous peoples died off from disease. But that also meant there wasn't an economic base to exploit, so European nations had to just import their own from their own excess populations, a very slow and tedious process. Note that this is not what European Imperialism looks like in the Industrial Age, where native peoples are subjugated to be exploited for their labor, a much more efficient way to generate large quantities of wealth. Yeah there were some cash cows that could make the kings of Spain or France etc. individually rich, silver mines and Caribbean sugar and indigo plantations etc..  But that doesn't actually increase national wealth very much. Introducing a lot of specie in particular just ends up producing inflation- amethysts for instance went from being considered a precious gem equivalent to emeralds or rubies or diamonds, to being almost worthless after the discovery of Brazil. The price of luxury goods like sugar and tobacco and indigo dropped as production increased. Because these things didn't fundamentally increase baseline production of wealth any.

5702,"the majority of merchants and traders were orthodox Greeks. Life for the common folk was bad either you were a muslim or a christian. In the Ottoman empire, as a rule of thumb, official positions and goverment offices were held almost exclusively by Muslims and the money were in Greek, mainly orthodox hands. Many of those Greeks ended up either converting to Islam to save their fortunes AND stay on their homeland (all of them spoke fluent Turkish anyway), while others took their gold, jewelry and money left for Greece after the pop-exchange.

I can cite a first-hand example of my Great-grandfathers from Pontus (won't say from where exactly cause this ain't a throwaway). Two of them left for Greece, one stayed back, fortune divided threeway among them. All three were Orthodox Greeks, billingual in Pontic and Turkish. The one that stayed, I do not know how's he doing sadly, hope he is well. If he converted he probably is fine, if not he probably died.

Please stop this ""Greeks were slaves for 400 years"" bullshit. I cringe so hard when I see it. Our people proudly were part of the Ottoman empire and flourished under it, those who mattered at least. Now the peasants had it bad whether they served under a Greek Basileus or a Turkish Padishah. And let's not speak about the devshirme drafting. If not for religion, I 'd rather see my son as a Jannisary or a vizier in the palace rather than living in shit, if I was a poor farmer from the Balkans.

Plus, the child-abduction happened in the Balkans. In the BALKANS. Yeah, it sucks for the slavs living there but the Greeks lived in Anatolia and Thrace mainly so they were impacted less. Economically important cities were excluded from it, so Thessalonike that was a Greek stronghold in the Balkans suffered not. First sons of carpenters, blacksmiths, etc. were excluded also. In the end the only two regions that Greeks really suffered were Thessaly and Epirus and there were not many of them.

Shit was fine for Greeks (and most other ethnicities) until the young Turks movement happened and those fuckers in Peloponese were persuaded by the UK to declare independence. Then the slight discrimination started happening and the Turkish-Greek relations inside the empire went downhill and shit hit the fan after the Greco-Turkish war following WWI which by the way the Greek goverment fucking blew.

&gt; [...]

&gt; Fundamentally this system is very undemocratic, yes EU needs to evolve and have a direction but this should be choosen by people in EU not by countries that are strongest economically.

This is because of the European Council. Countries (in particular ruled by dudes like Orban) do not want to remove power from the Council. But more powerful countries have a larger sway on geopolitics, it has always been like this everywhere in the world. The only thing that prevents this are supranational institutions like there are in the European Union. The power of the Council means countries as individual entities still decide a lot of what EU does, so whoever weights most still has more clout than whoever weights less. European institutions make it more fair to smaller countries, but initiative more readily comes from larger countries.

They simply don't like other people. They never did, but now they don't have a problem anymore to admit it in public.

It stabilized in some countries already though (including mine), and in other countries, there's a counter-reaction starting to take place.

Can't remember a US politician getting this close to being a presidential candidate while calling himself a socialist.

And guess what? He's (one of) the most popular politician(s) in the US and his support is only growing.

The nations are very similar true, but there are differences which would never be agreed on. That's why the Nordic countries aren't a federal state, but they are in a Union with each-other, and vote the same on many polices to support each-other.

But Sweden's immigration polices, Finland and Sweden's neutrality (or Norway and Denmark's ""non-neutrality""), Norway's Defense policies and Norway's opposition to the EU means such a union would never happen.",Norway,/r/europe/comments/92aex4/almost_half_of_swedes_and_danes_would_prefer/e36cv34/,Flavvy_,1532763381

It's in order to stop women from having sex out of pleasure, so they don't practice infidelity. Also to make sure that the woman didn't have any sex when she gets married to her new husband, because the first time they have sex the stitches open and you can clearly see the difference afterwards,  But the last part is a bit of a farce since the women just get it performed on them again if they had sex/got raped before marriage.",German in Romania,/r/europe/comments/92c5o4/somali_mother_first_to_be_sentenced_under_new_law/e36cw3t/,FramserSpanser,1532763437
