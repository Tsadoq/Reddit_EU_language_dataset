4,"&gt; Dude come the fuck on, you guys never shut up when Leftists try explain to you in-depth the economic and political complexity of nations that are regularly accused to be functioning as socialist, and all the ways in which they didn’t function as socialist.

What political and economic complexity? I'm right here, willing to hear you out. Explain it to me. What part of it doesn't mean stealing and brutalizing, even murdering, in the name of jealously? That's how I see it right now. I'm willing to hear you out on specific examples but defining socialism to be ""when it works"" is completely unfair. Do you see that?

&gt; Yet I can see a mile away that you’re about to try and split hairs so you can make a “Not real Capitalism” argument.

""Not real _____""? That's usually an argument made by socialists. Why invoke it for a different ideology here?

&gt; Killing people for resources, as a means of capital gain, is a pursuit of Capitalism, an economic structure in which capital is priority, however you want to divide the nuances in application from country to country, that primary rule remains the same.

44,"&gt; If every couple would have 1 or 2 children then we wouldn't have this issue so it's not about smaller families per se. The problem is that many women have no children at all (for the record I'm not blaming women, this is merely a factual observation). Why is it a problem, you may ask? Well, what will be the future of our countries without new generations? When we become old and sick, who will work and keep the country running?

Luckily reduced fertillity correlates heavily with longer life expectancy and better health in old age as well as increased automation and talks about universal basic income.

Those countries can manage. I was talking to a relative about this yesterday who's 65 and does not remotely look like it how we both look cosniderably younger than we are and note that everyone seems to look younger than they are as if each generation looks younger than the last at the same age due to better health and longer life. They'e 65 and recently retired but are as fit as someone in prime of their lives and look like someone who is 30-40 which is increasingly common these days..

People get healither and healthier at older ages; they can handle it. The retirement age should just go up because 65 is laughable nowadays. 65 year old people are well capable of stil working nowadays due to increased good health.

Edit: In fact thinking about it I think retirement age as a concept should just be abolished; there already are and should be state-support for those who are too sick to work; whether that is due to old age, accident, or genetic muscle diseases should not matter. If a doctor rules that you are too stick to work or to work fully the state should step in, naturally older people eventually become incapable of work and at that moment rather than a hard age should they enter ""retirement"" which is the normal law regarding ""too sick to work"".

It also ties into that I think a flat retirement age is wrong and that people who do back-breaking construction work should probably retire earlier and that happens here; they damage their body and thus become too sick to work earlier.",Ende Zyne prostaat voelde dat het ghoedt was.,/r/europe/comments/9vm0zb/remarkable_decline_in_fertility_rates/e9elzji/,dat_heet_een_vulva,1541827422

62,"&gt; Out of interest what are the opinions that believe a referendum could be held without violating the constitution?

These opinions come from: 

* The Spanish Constitutional Court resolutions.

* The former Spanish Constitutional Court attorney Joaquín Urias. He explains it [here](https://youtu.be/pZ3wNTrFILI?t=383) (in Spanish): *I believe that the Spanish government could call a referendum in Catalonia where anything could be asked in this referendum. The Spanish Constitutional Court had a sentence in which it said that the right to decide can exist and that a referendum is possible, if authorized by the Spanish government. But over time, the Court has backtracked a little, and right now there are Court rulings that would come to prohibit asking people in a referendum if they want to separate from Spain. This seems problematic to me and I don't share it. I think this isn't democratic. But it seems that it is the position that the Constitutional Court is now following.*

* Garbiñe Biurrun, president of the High Court of Justice of the Basque Country, explains [here](http://mp4-high-dwn.media.tv3.cat/2/1/1499025396312.mp4) (in Catalan and Spanish): *A consultation could be held with all legal guarantees, even if it isn't supported by the State. The Constitution says nothing against it, but it has been the Constitutional Court that has determined that it isn't possible. However I understand that there may be and should be other interpretations of the Constitution, because the Constitution in this issue is silent.*

The legal argument is based on the fact that the Constitution doesn't prohibit asking in a referendum about whatever you want. The article 2 of the Constitution, that you have mentioned, affirms that ""The Constitution is based on the indissoluble unity of the Spanish Nation"". What means that an independence is theoretically prohibited. But it doesn't prohibit you from asking about it (without carrying it out, just asking for opinion). It is not necessary to reform the Constitution for this referendum to take place. The Spanish government could organize a referendum of independence in Catalonia to get the opinion of the Catalans, without it being unconstitutional. This opens the door to many options; being the first and most obvious to finally know the real opinion of the Catalans on this subject. And from there, look forward to other solutions. Just asking is already part of the solution. 

A more radical (and better) option would be the following: to reach an agreement between the Spanish and Catalan governments so that a referendum of independence is held, and that if the yes vote wins, the Spanish parties commit themselves to adopt the necessary constitutional reform to make the result effective. But if the no wins, nothing is reformed and everything remains the same. That is, the commitment that after the referendum, the Constitution will be reformed so that the result is adopted. In this way, the moment of the constitutional reform is transferred to after the referendum, and making it depend on the result, instead of before it.

Regarding the four main Spanish political parties, only one included the independence referendum in Catalonia within its electoral program: Podemos (the third most voted in the last elections). The party leader [Pablo Iglesias](https://www.lasexta.com/programas/el-objetivo/noticias/pablo-iglesias-el-referendum-en-cataluna-tiene-que-ser-juridicamente-vinculante_20170129588e66da0cf2d32115ffb472.html): *The political conflict in Catalonia must be resolved through dialogue and through democratic means. The referendum in Catalonia has to be legally binding.*

---------

The above represents the most important opinions. There are minority opinions that are based on the interpretation of Article 2 of the Constitution. For example, those who understand that the Spain Nation doesn't include the other ""nations"". Of the 19 regions that make up Spain, some of them are legally considered ""nationalities"" by Spain. And some of them, historically three (Basque Country, Catalonia and Galicia) have defined themselves as nations (not recognized by Spain). So the indissoluble unity would only affect the Spanish Nation (Madrid, Castile, Cantabria, etc.), but not those regions that are considered nations. This is an interpretation that probably would never accept the Spanish Constitutional Court.


-----

Finally you have the opinion coming from the international law. Here the support from experts has been quite important. It's affirmed that Spain can not use the excuse of the Constitution eternally to block a democratic solution, and that international law prevails over internal constitutional law. In the same sense as many other independences, such as that of Kosovo that violates Serbian constitutional law, they have been recognized on the basis of international law. International Law experts like French professor Guillaume Tusseau and American professor Paul Williams have said [this](https://i.imgur.com/ugCfPyX.png) about Catalonia's right to self-determination.

Here you also have the opinion from International Law professor Marc Weller at University of Cambridge: *Having reviewed the recent practice and international judgments on Kosovo, we fully conclude that there is no prohibition on the unilateral declaration of independence in the Catalan case. If the central government represses or prohibits the referendum, this will only increase its legitimacy.*

Another opinion, from Richard A. Falk, American professor emeritus of international law at Princeton University: *Catalonia is winning the battle of legitimacy, which is one of the elements that are studied when discussing recognition of the right to self-determination of a territory, as it has acted in a peaceful way and seeking agreement within the democratic institutions, while the Spanish state responded with repression, intimidation and trying to cause some episode of violence. International law chooses the side that has acted more legitimately and rejects the unreasonable methods of the central government.*

&gt; The only possibility I've heard of before is that ""Title X"" which sets the insanely high barrier for changes to certain parts of the constitution does not protect itself with that same barrier. So theoretically you could change Title X much more easily and lower the barrier that way. A bit of a sneaky loophole which still requires the cooperation of the Spanish Government but less impossible than the alternative.

This is totally true. I wonder why this option is not talked about. Did you find it yourself? It's kind of a loophole, yes, but it still is valid and constitutional. And you could also connect it with what I said at the beginning: the referendum is made first, without reform, and then the reform of Title X is made to allow an easier reform. The problem is that if a minority of deputies did not agree, they could easily request a constitutional referendum to approve the change.

TL;DR: This is more a political issue, than a legal one. With political will, this issue would have been already resolved. But unfortunately, for the important Spanish parties, the unity of Spain is something ""sacred"" that is above anything else. So they block any political solution or dialogue. Nor does the Constitutional Court help, whose members are appointed by Spanish politicians (PP and PSOE) and who impose their vision of the Constitution.",Catalonia,/r/europe/comments/9vanxl/why_does_there_seem_to_be_more_sympathy_for_a/e9eml5p/,JosepFontana,1541828274

The populist Five Star Movement put a fabricated video on their Facebook page some days ago, claiming that the former President of the Eurogroup (Dijsselbloem) had a plan to bankrupt Italy by raising interest rates.

They made it look like he was planning to do all that, but his words were twisted and Dijsselbloem never said any of those things at all. Quite the opposite.

And now they find it weird that no one (apart from their own constituents) takes them seriously? And now they start crying that no one has faith in them and their budget?

My main point is that this map is largely bullshit because you can pick almost any country in europe and half the continent would be coloured red. That's just what empires did.

218,"&gt;You mean that when women are getting more educated, have a career and can make their own decisions, more of them choose to have smaller families?

If every couple would have 1 or 2 children then we wouldn't have this issue so it's not about smaller families per se. The problem is that many women have no children at all (for the record I'm not blaming women, this is merely a factual observation). Why is it a problem, you may ask? Well, what will be the future of our countries without new generations? When we become old and sick, who will work and keep the country running? 

&gt;Now add to that simply no time or money to raise kids for the people who do want that, and this is the result.

I'm not sure that money is the main issue, if that would be the case then poor countries would be the ones with low fertility rates. Also with all respect, I find it hard to believe that women for example in Sweden or Germany - with all the welfare benefits, have no money to raise 1-2 children. I believe that social standards and life priorities play a much bigger role than pure financial reasons because if people don't have money to raise children in Germany or Sweden then really, is there any country in the world that would be ideal for raising children?

&gt;It's not even bad. We can do with less people on this planet.

I agree but the issue is that the population globally isn't decreasing, it's still rising, which means that there is a sharp asymmetry in demographics between Europe and the rest of the world.

250,"In Corleone, ground zero for the Cosa Nostra and the source of the name for The Godfather’s Don Vito, Salvatore Riina’s old house is now the base for a 150-hectare organic tomato and legume farm employing former drug addicts, people with learning and behavioural problems and refugees. Through the Campi della Legalita programme, the co-operative hosts sixth-formers who volunteer for two weeks on the farm.

Its founder, Calogero Parisi, has flowing black hair and a cigarette almost permanently attached to his bottom lip. He tells me he was drawn into activism in the 1990s after taking part in the anti-Mafia caravan, a convoy of trucks that tours Sicily every summer. The Riina family farm that the co-operative took over in 2001 has faced many attacks from the Mob.

Land represents the power of the person, Parisi explains. “You can say ‘All this land is mine,’ ” he says. He recalls how first their vines were burnt, then a field of lentils. “Then,” he chuckles, as if talking about a mischievous child, “we planted a wood, but they sent their sheep to graze there all the time so the plants never grew.”

The original owner of the land was Riina’s nephew, Giovanni Grizzaffi. He was released from prison last year after more than 20 years and Parisi says it is awkward, to say the least, to see him around town. “Let’s say we are not on speaking terms.”

In April, two of the co-operative’s tractors, two trailers and a truck worth €70,000 were stolen, forcing Parisi to obtain a loan that will take five years to pay off. Since then he has been thinking more seriously about giving up. “We have to work so hard with an organic farm and we make so many sacrifices. We even sowed crops on Christmas Day. Sometimes you wonder if it is worth it.”

The final link of the food chain is restaurants and eateries, which provide the principal channel for money laundering. An estimated 5,000 restaurants in Italy are in the hands of the Mob, according to the Observatory. In Rome and Milan, clans are estimated to own one in five.

'We flyered a whole neighbourhood with leaftets saying ""A people that pays 'pizzo' [protection money] is a people without dignity,'"" Daniele Marannano of Addiopizzo © Valentino Bellini In Palermo, a group of graduates who wanted to open a pub were shocked to learn they would be expected to pay protection money, or pizzo. In defiance they founded Addiopizzo (goodbye pizzo), an organisation that supports businesses resisting extortion threats. Activist Daniele Marannano says: “We flyered a whole neighbourhood with leaflets saying ‘A people that pays pizzo is a people without dignity.’ ”

The softly spoken Marannano, 33, remembers the day in 1992 when prosecutor Paolo Borsellino was murdered by a car bomb in Palermo. “I was eight years old and coming back from the beach with my father. We saw my cousin in the street and he threw himself across the car to tell us. I will never forget it. I think, for those of us who lived through this at that age, it had more impact.”",,/r/europe/comments/9vq0sw/how_the_mafia_got_to_our_food/e9e77cr/,gravitronK,1541810989

253,"At Addiopizzo’s headquarters, Marannano points to a map delineating the borders of Mafia families’ territory in the city. Many businesses who pay are not driven by fear but by habit and convenience, he says. “If I am a butcher and another butcher opens in my area with competitive prices, that’s annoying to me. If I’ve paid my pizzo, the Mafia will go to them and explain, ‘Amico, this is the price.’ ”

Natale Giunta, a well-known chef in Palermo, received such a visit when he opened a new restaurant in 2012. “There were three of them, including one person I knew, who made the introductions,” he recalls. “They said I had not asked permission and demanded €2,000 a month, plus double at Christmas and Easter.” Giunta refused to pay. But after the visit, he received bullets in the post. Then one of his catering vans was set on fire, causing €100,000 worth of damage. Giunta now has police protection.

Marannano says that when Addiopizzo started in 2004, those who dared to report extortion to the police could be counted on one hand: “Now I can say that people have a choice.” The bravery of those who resist, and the existence of grass-roots anti-Mafia movements that would have been unthinkable a generation ago, is heartening.

On its own, though, it is unlikely to force the clans to loosen their grip on the land. Aside from a special law brought in to protect Italian olive oil in 2013, current legislation against agricultural crimes is extraordinarily lenient, creating little risk for perpetrators.

A new law that would create several new crimes has been proposed by Elena Fattori, a Five Star Movement MP. It would seek to punish “public-health catastrophes”, the poisoning or contaminating of food or water, and “agropiracy”, the sale of counterfeit food. “In Italy, we have a lot of checks on food but no consequences,” says Fattori. “The risk is too low: the perpetrators just pay a fine and carry on. To protect public health and [protect] against the destruction of honest work we need to do much more.” The time frame for such a law is unclear: Fattori’s proposal is not part of Five Star’s agreed government programme with its rightwing coalition partners the League.

Beyond legislation, consumers can try to buy products with a transparent, ethical provenance. But Governale at the DIA believes the long-term solution is better governance. In deprived areas where the state doesn’t guarantee basic rights or services — from hospital beds, to transport for farm workers — people are more likely to turn to Mob bosses than to institutions for loans or protection, he says. “At the end, the population become almost supportive of those that suffocate them . . . 

“Since 1992, on the investigative level, we [law and order] have been at the cutting edge. But to win definitively, it’s not enough to investigate, we need to improve the level of society.” Otherwise, the Mafia becomes insidious in every sector. “In agriculture, its grip is parasitical,” he says. “The Mafia is fundamentally a weed and you need strong weed killer to kill it.”",,/r/europe/comments/9vq0sw/how_the_mafia_got_to_our_food/e9e783i/,gravitronK,1541811011

478,"&gt; So if it is destroying competition why should the state hand out subsidies at all?

Because in some fields it's either way too important for the citizens or it's one of the power exclusive to the state. The point is that it's forbidden and that the existing subsidized projects are an exceptions.

&gt; It is not illegal to be subsidized by the state.

it is. I don't know if you think that repeating nonsense will make it true but let me help you, it won't. State aid are a rarity nowadays and if it impacts the free market you are in for some fines. In this case Ryan Air tried to profit of the state money and an EU court judge it illegal. If you want to know why go look up the decision but the point remain that France had nothing to do with the decision. here to help you with this notion http://ec.europa.eu/competition/state_aid/overview/index_en.html

&gt; Im only interested in the subsidized part, also why shouldnt RyanAir be allowed to use appeals?

They were allowed to use appeals as the rule of law give them the opportunity. The problem is that they used every single one existing and when came the moment to pay, they simply waited in silence, not answering to the request. Ostrich is stupid.

&gt; Also why should they be allowed to seize an asset worth 50-80 times of the actual fine in the first case?

Well as i said the law gave you an order to pay you refuse to follow the order, the court decides that since you won't pay the entity that you own the money has a right to get money through every asset you own.
If Ryan Air had refused to pay after the plane was seized the airport could have sold it and take 500K out of the sell and give Ryan Air the 97,5M left.

Plus, the less you build for cars, the less you force people into cars. Poznan has a 1.4 million people metro area, if everyone is forced to drive - imagine 1.4 million cars on those roads. So those who like driving benefit also, since you have more room on roads and less congested roads.

It takes me almost exactly 60 minutes to get to my university if I take public transportation (which I usually do) and 15 minutes if I would go by car. The problem is if a person, such as my self, doesn't live near a trainstation (pendeltåg/tunnelbana). The busses don't get you far so you have to take the bus to the nearest terminal (bus/train terminal) and from there connect to where ever you're going. 

This is not efficient for say full time workers or students, spending too much time on ""simple"" things like buying groceries because there is no grocery store within walking distance away from your house.

747,"&gt;Of course they're not happy to fund much of anything with the profits of load-following as load-following low CO2 sources are particularly under-valued in the market. We don't pay much if anything for no CO2 emissions and the money available to pay for dispatchability is suppressed by the legacy fossil generators still on the grid. 

There's an international electricity market in Europe. They can sell out their load following internationally, and yet they don't. Hell, don't even look further than France: still 8,35% fossil fuels and 12% hydro power to balance it out. Furthermore, the nuclear plants that do operate in load following mode in France get internally subsidized by the fulltime operating plants. Fact is that nuclear power that doesn't have the luxury of the grid being built around it is going to have worse efficiency statistics than those typically used to support nuclear power and compare it with other sources.

&gt;If Germany had to unplug it's coal and pay a market rate for power on a still overcast day we'd start to see Nuclear be happier about the price they're getting.

[Germany exported 13.7 TWh more to France than it imported.](https://www.renewable-ei.org/en/activities/column/20180302.html) Clearly France isn't having that much slack either.

&gt;You wouldn't halve the up-time necessarily as there's a number of ways to smooth out the short peak, all the storage methods become a lot more relevant when you're only expected to manage the peak of demand ( no more the 20% of the load ) over a short period of time. Indeed some of the thermal solar techniques for storing energy overnight would be very useful hooked up to a nuclear plant to provide some over-producion during the peak.

Better storage and better international interconnections would be useful for both nuclear and renewables, so that's not the problem, should happen anyway.",Limburg,/r/europe/comments/9uf5x5/frances_nuclear_clean_energy_is_over_three_times/e9cz6oe/,silverionmox,1541774388

769,"&gt; Nuclear weaponry =/= nuclear power
&gt;The Manhattan project was the development of the nuclear bomb. Whether or not the USA was ever interested in developing nuclear power, they still would have made the bomb. So, it's not correct to put it as a subsidy for nuclear. Similarly, it would also be stupid to add the development cost of semiconductors to the cost of solar power. Semi conductors are an essential technology for Solar PV, but we developped it for other reasons.

That funding was instrumental in identifying and locating the fuel resources, to exploit and refine a large amount of them, setting up the entire production chain. Later, the military interest was a major factor why countries chose nuclear energy: having a nuclear industry around kept open the option to turn it into weapons, just in case. Military intersts have always been a driving force behind the industry.

&gt;Yeah, megatons to megawatts was a thing, but I don't think that supply is still a thing. The program itself ended in 2015, so the reserves will depleted soon-ish.

Sure, but it gives a false sense of resource security, and it's still a direct subsidy through military budgets by providing free fuel.

806,"&gt;**Black plastic, which cannot be recycled, to be phased out by end of month**  
&gt;  
&gt; [Lidl](https://www.theguardian.com/business/lidl) UK says it will remove black plastic from its entire fruit and vegetable range by the end of the month.  
&gt;  
&gt;Black plastic packaging is not recyclable in the UK, as it cannot be detected by the sorting systems used for plastic recycling, and the supermarket chain says its move will save an estimated 50 tonnes of black plastic waste a year.  
&gt;  
&gt;It also plans to remove black plastic from its fresh meat, fish and poultry range by August next year, it announced on Friday.  
&gt;  
&gt;The moves are part of its plans to make 100% of its own-label packaging – which it says will only be used where necessary – widely recyclable, reusable or refillable.  
&gt;  
&gt;Black plastic packaging will be replaced by alternatives, which Lidl says will be fully recyclable, but which could include clear plastic.  
&gt;  
&gt;Julian Kirby, plastics campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “Getting rid of black plastic is a positive first step. It seems ridiculous that so much plastic is still being produced which can’t even be recycled.  
&gt;  
&gt;“But let’s not just switch one plastic for another. Our fruit and vegetables don’t need to come smothered in a plastic jacket.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Ultimately, to end the scourge of plastic pollution clogging up our oceans, we need to get rid of most plastic altogether.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Louise Edge, senior oceans campaigner for Greenpeace UK, was less qualified in her praise. She said Lidl’s action was a clear signal to the government and major retailers that speedy action was possible.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Supermarkets are the place where a lot of the throwaway plastic filling up our homes comes from, so it’s good to see more of them are responding to the public’s concern by taking action,” she said. “Black plastic is one of the most problematic forms of plastic you can find on supermarket shelves, and Lidl are doing the right thing by phasing it out as quickly as possible.”  
&gt;  
&gt;[Not all clear plastic is recyclable](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/aug/04/only-a-third-of-plastic-food-packaging-can-be-recycled-councils-say) and what types can be recycled can also vary by area.  
&gt;  
&gt;Ryan McDonnell, Lidl’s commercial board director, said the “significant move away from black plastic demonstrates our dedication to tackling this important topic”.

834,"&gt;mainly because mamy historians find it wrong to do so

You mean because **some** historians find it wrong to do so. Futhermore, almost no historian experienced in the topic would not consider the Empire after the 7th Century to still be the Roman Empire. Even Ostrogorsky acknowledges that the Empire is still the Roman Empire, he merely comes to the conclusion that a different term is needed to reference what he percieves as the more Greek character the Empire gained during the 7th-8th Century.

Other historians, like for example Anthony Kaldellis do not subscribe to Ostrogorsky's thesis at all, and while they acknowledge that the 7th Century brought on major changes, they focus more on the continuity of the state institutions and culture.

&gt;Also after Heraklios we're not talking anymore about Augustus of the eastern Roman Empire

Yes we are, actually. Basileus became the new primary title for the Emperor, yes that is true. However Augustus did not fall out of use, it was still very much used to refer to the Emperor. As someone who is currently reading through the Book of Ceremonies I can tell you that Augustus is used almost as much much as Basileus when referring to the Emperor, in the 10th Century no less.

While on the other hand, for the Empress, Augusta was almost exclusively the preferred term. The femenine form of Basileus, ""Basilissa"" is used extremely rarely in the sources I've read. 

Infact Augustus was used all the way until the 15th Century, as can be seen [in this miniature](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1d/Manuel_II_Helena_sons.JPG) where Manuel II Palaiologos is referred to as ""Always Augustus"".

Furthermore, it is funny you use the loss of Augustus as the primary title as the point where continuity is broken, when Augustus itself had also replaced Caesar a few centuries before. Why is continuity broken when Basileus replaced Augustus, but not when Augustus replaced Caesar? Caesar was still used all the way until the 15th Century too, but its meaning completely changed, unlike Augustus.

&gt;among his other reforms like adopting Greek language

There's no evidence Heraclius ""adopted the Greek language"", Latin continued to be used on coins, chants and titles well after his reign. Likewise, Greek had already been used extensively for Justinian's legal code. Heraclius' reign did not see any major changes in the state language, which was a gradual process.

It's the opposite here though, in that our specialized institutions with university status: KI (medicine), KTH, CTH (engineering) and HHS (economics/business) are all high in the rankings.

Nevertheless, the Times Higher Education rankings has a long tradition of being an unfair ranking for in smaller, non-English speaking countries. Maybe they fixed it a bit, because we didn't have as many universities ranked before. (the UK still seems over-represented though) Because, while ranking stuff on the basis of stuff like how often the research gets cited works fine on the natural science end, it is misleading for more local subjects like law and the humanities, which have less international impact in smaller countries with less-spoken languages. e.g. There are probably more scholars of Shakespeare alone out there than for all Scandinavian literature combined.

There is a stereotype that people from Transylvania are a little “slow”, so maybe that is transposed in the way that we drive. :)
 
From the beginning I imagined that the difference between the regions cannot be that high, so I searched for the source. I don’t know what formula they used, with the data they got [here](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Transport_statistics_at_regional_level), because there is no reference the “Number of fatal road accidents”. But by using „Fatal victims in road accidents in the region in 2016” raported to „Total population in the region in 2016”, i got the following numbers.


* Bucuresti-Ilfov 58.11
* Nord West 90.81
* Centre 99.33
* West 99.07
* South-Muntenia 100.28
* North East 105.64
* South West-Oltenia 105.83
* South East 111.74. 

The value for Romania is  96,81.

So what i’ve got is: „Number of fatal victims in road accidents relative to population size, for 2016” (per million inhabitants). 

There are a few differences between the regions but they are not that major with the exception of the capital and the North West region.

When, before WWII, Luftwaffe Flugkapitän Erich Warsitz (the first man in aviation history to fly a jet) also became the first man to fly a (He 176) rocket-plane, Von Braun exclaimed: ""Later we will fly to the moon with you at the helm!"". But Germany fell and Von Braun worked for the US (Warsitz  refused to work for the USSR and was imprisoned for war crimes).

In any case, it was Germany's Wernher von Braun who sent chimps to space and Americans to the moon. It was Germany's scientists that did everything truly innovative and interesting at NASA or the analogous Soviet space program. When they  retired/died, well, ... the quality of NASA projects sunk, despite its *relatively* (by European standards) huge budget. 

It's as if NASA went into slow motion.  It seemed to settle to the level of innovative thinking you might expect  from an extremely well financed remedial high school, not to say one for the mildly mentally challenged. The Shuttle program for example is fascinating as a display of stupidity ... from its very conception. And so, never mind the expected *2001 Space Odyssey* kind of stuff,  after a while NASA found itself unable to send '*Astronauts*' ('*Sailors to the stars*' no less :/) even to low earth orbit.

The culture that founded the Roman Empire was the Latin one, yes. But being Roman did not at any point equate being Latin after the Social War which kind of put that idea in the trash bin.

Furthermore your last example literally makes no sense. The United States literally declared independence from Britain and waged a War of Independence against their former overlord. The Greek speaking part of the Roman Empire never did this, they never declared independence (aside from the failed Palmyrene Empire which did not go anywhere), and they still saw themselves as Romans.

You have nothing to back that up.

COMPLETELY DIFFERENT TOPIC than 'does it work' vs ' not enough time on teh market to make investment decisions.'

You have a serious problem with bringing up shit that I didnt argue for or against and act like do or should care.

You dont say... power plants require maintenance.  NO ONE FUCKING SAID ZERO maintenance on MSR.

You are literally arguing against a strawman.  None of the shit you are replying with is anything the fuck to do with anything I said.

Does the technology work? Yes.  Does it need more testing? Sure.  Is it new and therefore scary to investors? Yes, and no fucking shit.

Does that mean we should say ' it isn't viable?' Fuck no.  Do we say it doesnt work? No, because that would be false.

&gt;The risks are minors in a lab, they are what kill a plant even at the project stage.

thats fine, no one said it would easy, but suggesting it doesnt work is not the same as 'there COULD be issues building a power plant.'

These are completely different things.  Does the reaction work? Yes.  Is the system passive? Yes.  Is the system under extra pressure? No.

Are there MSR companies right now working on this? Yes.

So what is your point exactly?  It's was defunded not because it didnt work, but out of laziness and taking the easy road.


But there is far more thorium in the ground than there is uranium. Finding a way to burn nickle instead of platinum that has proven to work and just needs time and love could change the planet.

1019,"&gt; Euro tailored for german economy hurts the southern europe a lot, thus endangering the whole EU project.

Here's the bit you guys don't get: The Euro doesn't need to be tailored for Germany for it to have this effect. Because there are countries which don't try to export massively like Germany, the Euro will always be valued lower than what a reinstated Deutsche Mark would be. The very Euro system fuels divergence by structurally encouraging exports for exporters and easy borrowing for importers (there are many steps in between but this is the barebones version). As a result, the only long-term winning strategy is trying to become a net exporter _as long as too many countries don't try the same_ because you don't have enough consumption in the world to absorb that kind of export value. Currently the winners are Eastern Europe, they're doing exactly this while the west can't compete, except for Germany which integrated its supply chain with the east.

and then I ask you for an ""opposing argument"" to my well researched Welsh history narrative and receiving none I would consider you ""a bit of a dick""

P.S: We could do the same with places like the Chzech republic never having been independent before 1993 becaue there had never been a ""Kingdom of the Chzech Republic"", it was only a minor *province* or *region* of Austria which some rich assholes wanted to convince the world they were a nation. I would know because I checked the Catalan wikipedia and Europa Universalis 4 and I've seen no ""Kingdom of the Chzech Republic"" thus confirming my theory.

* Nowadays everyone has the possibility to buy a cheap but old car, hence all kind of problems with the quality of the cars and the level of driving skill of the drivers.

* The poor state and undersized level of the road infrastructure. There are a lot of auto vehicles on the road and the infrastructure existing today can hardly take all the traffic.
* And then again, comes in play the human mentality-culture-civilized factor.

1211,"I think your view well represents the consensus here so I'd like to counter it.


Firstly Northern Ireland is unique and so not a great comparison for other independence movements in Europe. The Good Friday Agreement gives Northern Ireland an almost special status of being within the UK while obligating the UK to hold a referendum should it look like there is majority support for unification with Ireland. It also protects people's rights to identify as Irish or British or both within Northern Ireland. This is very different from Catalonia and Scotland, one because neither of them have this unique arrangement and two because the issue in Northern Ireland is whether to be part of ROI or the UK which is fundamentally different from seeking independence.


As for Scotland, you say it has a legal right to leave the UK. This isn't actually true. The only body in the UK with the ability to authorise a legally binding referendum on Scottish Independence is the British Parliament. There is nothing in UK law to say that Scotland has the right to independence or doesn't have the right to independence. We've seen this already, in 2014 the UK Parliament played ball and authorised the legally binding referendum, but just years later after the Brexit result the Scottish Parliament requested a second independence referendum but the British Government simply refused, saying that the issue of Scottish independence should be addressed post-Brexit. This obviously disgruntled many in Scotland but it wasn't a ""no, never again"" it was a ""now is not the time"" which effectively put the issue to bed for a while.


What makes Catalonia so different is that Spain does have a constitution and in that constitution independence for the regions is specifically prohibited. This means that any simple legally binding referendum would first require a constitutional change which is such an insanely high barrier it's impossible. This would be the process:


&gt;two-thirds of each House of the Spanish Parliament approve the amendment, elections are called immediately thereafter, two-thirds of each new House approves the amendment, and the amendment is approved by the people across the whole of Spain in a referendum.

So as you can see, that would be virtually impossible to achieve even with the support of the Spanish Government of the day. And literally impossible without the support of the Spanish Government.


This means that legal and democratic means are **not available to Catalonia** in the same way they are available to Scotland thanks to the lack of a constitutional barrier and a sensible British Government that doesn't act in an overly possessive manner and is willing to authorise a referendum in some cases.


I hope this helps clarify how cliched the general stance of this sub is. I think most people genuinely do not realise that Catalonia has no clear legal or democratic path to pursue which is why after decades of trying to bring Spain to the negotiating table Catalonia finally took the route of a unilateral independence referendum and declaration. It was not because they want to flaunt due process, it is because no due process is available to them.",Scotland,/r/europe/comments/9vanxl/why_does_there_seem_to_be_more_sympathy_for_a/e9c8hn5/,somescott,1541738226

This, very much. 

Nowadays the preferred option for all is a referendum agreed between the Spanish government and the Catalan government. Something that has been denied for years, despite the fact that 80% of Catalans currently demand that this referendum be carried out.^1 Alternatives that would have been accepted by Catalans were also denied in the past, such as granting them more autonomy (denied in 2010).

If a solution is not offered after years, it isn't strange that a unilateral path is chosen. Nor is it something that Catalans have invented: [examples of unilateral declarations of independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateral_declaration_of_independence#Examples).

1294,"&gt; Firstly, the region trying to achieve independence is not going to want that restriction,

We are talking about region being quite split when it comes to opinions. Supporters of independence are not the single voice of the region in question. And they should try to find good consensus with their opponents.

And I assume, actually I hope, that most people are not so much radicalized to demand independence just to become independent state where, say, 49 % of citizens are actually loyal to neighboring state, the legitimacy of said vote as representing true will of the people is going to be disputed over and over (as we see now with Brexit through claims of Russian influence) and so on.

Gaining support wide enough so the will of people is obvious even without any referendum and the referendum is just a formality is a far better way to go than to have demands just because the minority (or so-so present majority) is vocal enough.

1323,"&gt; Not too sure on NI and their history, but at least for Scotland you're right. Scotland was an actual independent country ""absorbed"" into UK so that's not at all comparable to Catalonia. Catalonia is a region and not a country so that's way more comparable to Sussex or whatever declaring independence from England than to Scotland declaring independence from the UK.

Being absorbed by Spain is exactly what happened to us in the 18th century... I'm afraid you have no knowledge of the history of Catalonia. I can explain you a little, although in Wikipedia you will find more information.

The [Catalan counties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_counties), under the rule of the [County of Barcelona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_of_Barcelona) (801–1162), united to form the **[Principality of Catalonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principality_of_Catalonia)**, a medieval state that existed from the 12th century to 1714, with its own institutions and laws. The [Catalan Courts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_Courts) were the parliamentary body. The [Catalan constitutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_constitutions) were the laws, etc. All this, many centuries before Spain even existed.

The Principality of Catalonia and the Kingdom of Aragon were the founders of a confederation called the [Crown of Aragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_of_Aragon), that expanded throughout the Mediterranean. But each state of the confederation maintained its independence, with its own institutions, laws and languages. The 3 main states were the Kingdom of Aragon (Aragonese Corts), the Principality of Catalonia (Catalan Corts) and the Kingdom of Valencia (Valencian Corts).

Everything ended in 1714, when our independence, laws, institutions and even language were eliminated by unilateral decision of Spain, due to the [Nueva Planta decrees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nueva_Planta_decrees). From Wikipedia: After the surrender of Barcelona in 1714, the king Philip V of Bourbon, inspired by the model of France imposed the abolutism and a unifying administration across Spain, and enacted the Nueva Planta decrees, which supressed the main Catalan political institutions and rights and merged them into the Crown of Castile as provinces.

You might also take a look at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_Republic_(1641), and the other [Catalan Republics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_Republic).

You cant alter a constitution with 50+1, but Cameron decided to do it with Scotland and Brexit. Canada established the Clarity Act to deal with these circumstances in Quebec. It not only deals with vote percentage, but also turnout.

The Venice commission recommends that there should be no super-majority requirements in such referendums, something few seemed to have any issues with when all the countries joined the EU without any such requirements (which Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Austria, Croatia etc. got away with too).

You talk of some treaty, as if Greece had any choice, after being enslaved by Turkey for 400 years, then the eventual Illegal occupation of Cyprus. And frankly, Greece probably never even signed:

&gt; The original text of the treaty is in French.[3] It was the result of a second attempt at peace after the failed Treaty of Sèvres, which was signed by all previous parties, except the Kingdom of Greece, but later rejected by the Turkish national movement who fought against the previous terms and significant loss of territory. The Treaty of Lausanne ended the conflict and defined the borders of the modern Turkish Republic. In the treaty, Turkey gave up all claims to the remainder of the Ottoman Empire and in return the Allies recognized Turkish sovereignty within its new borders

As can be seen, No treaty was accepted by Greece. And further more, it holds no value, in UN law. And it is the Turks breaking with it, anyways.

TBH  nobody even knows what treaty this is. We can only speculate, because he does not even reference it.

Also you are the one being lied to by Turkey. 

Also the fact that you are also Australian, you should be able to see what Turkey is doing. Because China is doing the exact same thing in your region, by pushing into the waters of the surrounding islands. China at least is making fake man made islands. Turkey does what the fuck it wants, without even bothering to make fake islands. But its no secret, Turkey has threatened to invade Greek Islands many times.

Honestly thank god for the Americans... Because they keep sending war ships into the areas china and turkey are claiming for themselves despite UN law.

1450,"No, not really. The county of Barcelona and other territories were in an union with the kingdom of Aragon and formed the Crown of Aragon. However, saying that Catalonia was an indepent country is an anacronism:

""""With the agreement of Barbastro in August 1137, the dynastic crisis closed and the institution we call the Crown of Aragon made its way, of which, with all evidence, originality has been exaggerated -states composed of a single royal lineage are usual in Europe in the Middle Ages and the opposite phenomenon is rare- and many anachronistic perspectives have been oversized. Among them, the frequent expression ""Catalan-Aragonese Confederation"" reflects well a point of view that makes territories, nations, nations, states; and states, abstract autonomous entities that function alien to the dominant groups and their interests, as a manifestation of the spirit of the people. It makes little sense to repeat - it has been said ad nauseam - that the identitarian images that dominate current discourses hardly date back to the 19th century and that, without doubt, one can find precursor signs of them long before, even in the late medieval period, but they are perfectly foreign to 12th century societies.""

Gives bad aftertaste right? Morally grey, right?

1549,"&gt;But like many regions in Spain, Catalonia has their own culture, language and in a way their own history. To dismiss that isn't going to help anyone.

Nobody's dismissing anything. The Catalan language and Catalan culture are very well protected in Spain, they're not in any danger of disappearing. If anything, they're more and more prominent each day.

But let's get into the details. Many independentists claim that a nation something similar to ""a large body of people united by common descent, history, culture, or language, inhabiting a particular state or territory"", which is the definition a fellow independentist redditor gives [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/9v882s/catalan_police_capture_a_far_right_lone_wolf/e9ac3eb/).

This concept of ""nation"" is what is called ""ethnic nation"" and comes from German Idealism from the 1800s, especially, Fichte. What many Catalan independentists argue is that all ethnic nations are stateless nations and that they should become nation-states if they willingly decide to do so. The path would be ethnic nation -&gt; self-determination -&gt; nation state. Therefore, Catalonia is an ethnic nation that should become a nation state.

This sounds cool, but it's stupid. According to this definition of ""ethnic nation"", Chinatown, NYC, would be an ethnic nation. Molenbeek, Brussels, would be an ethnic nation. All the gipsy communities would be nations. And, therefore, all those nations, Chinatown, Molenbeek or the gipsy peoples spread around Europe should have the right to become nation-states.

However, funnily enough, Catalan independentist never answer this question: ""Does [Tabarnia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabarnia) have the right to self-determination?""

Edit: And a little anecdote about the Catalan language in Catalonia. Some days ago the Spanish-speaking fomer mayor of Medellín, Colombia, went to the Catalan public (paid with taxpayer's money) TV, called TV3. The host of the show rejected to speak Spanish to him, even when he was making clear he didn't understand the question (the interpretation wasn't working) and it was the Barcelona mayor who had to help him and talk to him in Spanish. You can see the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOrAY6_1a0M). It's important to note that Spanish is an official language in Catalonia and that all 3 people in that show spoke Spanish. Please, someone explain to me how the Catalan language and cultures are in danger.",,/r/europe/comments/9vanxl/why_does_there_seem_to_be_more_sympathy_for_a/e9bkbvf/,heheheNEIN,1541716650

Stalinist state? The coalition of left parties won the elections 5 months before the coup.

Just sucks? We are the second country in the world in forced dissapearance behind Camboya.

Something telling is the 2005 EU Constitution referendum.

1660,"When talking big cosmopolitan cities like Barcelona, they're all sort of alike, so that doesn't really show much there.

Currently, there's little in Barcelona that has to do with Catalan culture. The only relevant thing that comes to mind is architecture, as in Gaudí or Puig i Cadafalch, whom were Catalan nationalists (Puig i Cadafalch became President even), where their work it's praised and all, but the political background of their figures is ignored for the sake of the Spanish narrative.

The only thing most of Spain sees a proper of them is when it's in for their interests, successful or about the ""Spanish Catalonia"". Whenever someone successful arises from a Catalan background, and it's someone who feels equally about Spain and Catalonia, or more for Spain, then that is a super promoted figure. But if you have a similar or better figure that is more on the Catalan side, they will be ignored. 

This shows a lot in sports too. Mind that, unlike in the UK, we don't even have official National Teams here, so sportsman are forced to compete under Spain. People like Marc Márquez (5 times MotoGP champion) are obviously catalans and catalanists, arguably independentists, but are appropiated as Spaniards; but whenever shit happens with any of them, then they'll be referred to with the Catalan demonym. And players like Piqué have had to leave the National Team for even suggesting that maybe we should vote —no one competing in any field can't really bring up freely their political feelings, as they'd be shunned and their career would end.

I always give this example: When David Villa scored with the National Team when they won the World Cup, broadcasters would sing Asturias national hymn. But when [Carles Puyol](https://www.mundodeportivo.com/r/GODO/MD/p2/Polideportivo/Imagenes/2014/03/04/Recortada/MD_20140304_MAS_DEPORTE_D_54402010715-570x762@MundoDeportivo-Web.jpg) scored the winner in the semi finals, the same broadcaster chanted an official Spanish chant —would never bring up any reference to the Catalan hymn, as it's seen as anti-Spanish.

I was thinking chefs too. One of the most prestigious restaurants in the world (actual 2nd or 3rd place I believe) is lead by Catalans who are catalanists, and they were boycotted for even participating with something regarding the political prisoners.

Anyway.

They see the rest with contempt, as things that are folkloric, ridiculous, rural or alien to them. Atm, the main opposition party in the Catalan Parliament doesn't chant the hymn —but they claim to love Catalonia (?).

1738,"The police said that it’s true that the effects of the strike are there but just that she didn’t contact them. The Warsaw police is also pro-government.

&gt;So who did they invite this year and what hate speech messages were they going to propagate?

In this translated excerpt from a post you have all the examples you need :3

“Mateusz Marzoch - Vice President of the Association, Head of the Independence March Guard; spokesman for the All-Polish Youth. In one of his last posts on TT he writes about political opponents per ""Citizens of the People's Republic of Poland"". This is by the way the march, which is supposed to unite all Polish patriots, regardless of their options and beliefs. \[1\] Apart from that, Mr. Marzoch was the president of the assembly at the Presidential Palace on 5 February 2018, where the slogans ""Remove the yarmulke, sign the law"", ""The end of the wedding - go back to Israel"" or ""I am not sorry for Jedwabne"" were proclaimed \[2\].

The organizations represented by these gentlemen do not need to be introduced to anyone. We have all heard of their activists' repeated anti-Semitic, xenophobic or homophobic speeches about their use of symbols such as the Falanga or the Celtic Cross. In order not to write down too much, it is only worth recalling such examples of events with their participation as:

\- Publishing by the All-Polish Youth a graphic with Lech Kaczyński with the caption ""We remember the faces of traitors"" \[3\].

\- conviction of three members of the ONR for performing the Roman salute \[4\]

\- displaying images of MEPs on gallows by activists of the Supervisory Board, the National Defence Agency and the Ministry of the Interior and Administration \[5\].

Additionally, the guests of the event. On November 11th, representatives of organizations openly referring to fascism will come to Warsaw (they have already participated in the editions of the Ministry of National Remembrance in previous years). These include, among others:

\- Laszlo Toroczkai, former vice-president of Jobbik and founder of Our Home Hungary party. Known for his participation in the ceremonies in honour of the fallen Wehrmacht soldiers, contacts with Anders Breivik and incitement to hatred against the Roma.

\- representatives of the Italian neo-fascist organization ""New Force"" (Forza Nuova) headed by Roberto Fiore, sentenced by an Italian court for being a member of a criminal group responsible for carrying out more than 30 bloody terrorist attacks.

\- nationalists from the People's Party Our Slovakia, referring directly to the tradition of Fr. Tiso, who ruled Slovakia when it was the satellite state of Nazi Germany and was executed for war crimes \[6\]; known, among other things, for denying the Holocaust.

&amp;#x200B;

These guests do not need an invitation to come to the MN - they come of their own free will. However, they have been doing this for years, and instead of being condemned by the organizers, it is a source of boast for them and is also explained by the cooperation between nationalist organizations from different countries. A clear proof of the friendship between these radicals and the organizers of the March is the fact that foreign ""guests"" have had to speak many times during previous marches \[7\].

&amp;#x200B;

2. The march is not a nationalist event, but a patriotic one. It is used exclusively to manifest love for the Homeland and to celebrate the national holiday.

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone probably heard about racist banners (how ""Europe will be white or not at all"") and shouts at the March \[8\], but many believe that in spite of all this, the majority of participants are ordinary Poles who love their country and collective responsibility should not be applied here. These are the famous FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN

Of course, I agree with the thesis that many MN participants (I guess most of them) go there with good, pure intentions. It is also not their role to fight against such extremes, because this task belongs to the organizers. In point 1. I have already shown, however, that such a fight on the part of the organizers should not be counted on, because the organizations represented by them, more or less openly, sympathize with these slogans - hence their consent to their presence. Even if hateful shouts and banners are a small percentage of the general public, the general public with its presence at the March and the acquisition of statistics legitimizes their activity and gives scope for propaganda, according to which the attendance at the Ministry of National Remembrance can be used as a proof of support for the above mentioned slogans in the society.”",Poland,/r/europe/comments/9v068x/warsaw_bans_nationalist_march_marking_polish/e9b2c48/,LordParsifal,1541702421

1752,"I was hoping for my shortbread metaphore to be sufficient. I have failed.   
233Pa is an intermediate state between what you get in nature (232Th) and what you want (233U). If you leave 233Pa in the core (or anywhere exposed to the neutron flux), it will capture some of those neutrons and ""lose the opportunity"" to decay into ""the good stuff"".    
I assume you are familiar with the concept of chain reaction: one neutron get captured, lead to fission, that release some neutrons, some of them are losts (they escape the core, or are captured in the structures), but enough are captured to lead to enough fission to keep the number of neutrons constant, rince, repeat.    
The neutrons are precious, you want to avoid ""spending"" them on things that won't give you more neutrons back (that's why 233U is the good stuff, it your ""neutron multiplier"").    
So, of course you can put your Th in, spend neutrons to convert it to 233Pa, spend more neutrons on Pa, and never get anything back. The same way you can put Nickel or Copper in your core, get exposed to neutron to their fill; but you would'nt call that an Nickel or Copper reactor, would you.    
It's like of course you can put some milk in the tank of your car, it will follow the fuel in the engine, get whatever reaction there, but if it doesn't burn and expanse and push those cylinders, you wouldn't call that a milk engine, would you?      


Is that any clearer?    


You will notice how I tried to link as much as possible to the math and numbers I'm using. I want to avoid as much as possible the ""Trust me"" argument. A first year physics student, or a high school science teacher should be able to check my math. And I'm happy to help clarify any point.   
I am quite openly pro-nuclear, although my post was raising some important issues about Thorium. I let you judge if that counts as being anti-nuclear or pro.   

Why are you accusing me of being condescending and needing more ""education""? Where in my post did I suggested anything like that?    
Look at all the math and numbers and metaphores (good or bad) and explanations (clear or not) I've tried to put up in a wall of text, in a quite generic, non specialist subreddit; does that look like ""only argument boils down to scolding and faith in you""?       
I've clearly tried to explain step by step (whether I succeeded or not), precisely to avoid sticking with ""math no one but experts can understand"".    
Not everybody can understand it, but anybody willing to put in the effort can. Forgive me, but it's still nuclear physics we're talking about, it's not my fault if it take some head scratching to grasp.   

If you're willing to put in the effort, I'll be happy to clarify the complexity. But then, you'll have to put some level of trust in me, and take the risk of me pulling a mentalist show on you.    
I'd be also happy with you bringing my post to someone you're more willing to trust. Like I said, medium math/physics skills should be enough to proof read me.   
A health physicist will also have a clear understanding of what a 27 days half life mean in terms of activity, and will be able to translate that in dose rate for you.

&gt; aircraft carriers 

You have to look at them as a mobile military base.  Lets say the Russians attacked and China stayed neutral but supplied Russia with equipment.   The aircraft carrier could be used to disrupt supplies on the Russia/Chinese border.  US carriers can produce 200,000 gallons of fresh drinking water a day.  They are good for disaster relief. 

&gt; F-whatever  

 The United States principally funds the F-35 JSF development, with additional funding from partners. The partner nations are either [NATO members](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_members) or close U.S. allies. The United Kingdom, Italy, Australia, Canada, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Turkey are part of the active development program.  The F-35 is the most advanced aircraft currently available.  The reason for its success is that so many countries were involved.  This is the concept that Europe must use in order to be successful.  You can't have 1 country fund all of the development and supply all of the brainpower.   

If European countries can just set aside their differences and work together this would work.  The biggest obstacle is going to be to convince them to provide the money needed to get it started.

True, but in the same way that lead is ""dirty"". 

&gt; Anti-tank and armor piercing projectiles include ""shells"" i.e. ""bombshells"" i.e. exploding munitions

False. Shells is a catch-all for anything fired from heavy weaponry. It's not 18th century anymore, the linguistic origin no longer applies. The only rounds using depleted uranium are:

 *  [Armor piercing sabots](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-00ca42ed748dd4f6966eaafd8530fb50-c): **no explosives**. 
 *  [Armor piercing autocannon rounds](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-009fbe004eaa7d522f4857ba36283053-c): **no explosives**. 

They are not big round black orbs with a wicker fuse that you seem to think they are. 

&gt;  Hence ""dirty bombs""

**None** of these are fucking explosive, and they certainly aren't bombs in any stretch of the word. 

Here is the definition of a ""dirty bomb"": 
&gt; A dirty bomb or radiological dispersal device (RDD) is a speculative radiological weapon that combines radioactive material with conventional explosives. The purpose of the weapon is to contaminate the area around the dispersal agent/conventional explosion with radioactive material, serving primarily as an area denial device against civilians. It is, however, not to be confused with a nuclear explosion, such as a fission bomb, which by releasing nuclear energy produces blast effects far in excess of what is achievable by the use of conventional explosives.

Depleted uranium rounds are (1) not radio-logical weapons, but kinetic ones, (2) are not designed to contaminate anything, but to achieve better penetration, (3) are not area denial weapons against civilians, but designed to destroy fortifications or armored vehicles (4) are not explosive.

1846,"&gt; If it wasn't nuclear it would probably be coal how is that better...

That's an assumption. People didn't switch to nuclear for nothing, coal is dirty even if you ignore the climate changing effect, and peopel would have kept looking for replacements/consumption reductions if nuclear didn't take that place.

&gt;You have to look at the energy production that is what he are talking about. I see: France: 45k, Germany: 332k. Germany is a bigger country but still is far from comparable.

The point is that despite being presented as a silver bullet for climate change, France apparently slacked off on gg footprint efforts. That's something to take into account: the false feeling of security by using nuclear.

&gt;There is a distance between not being a silver bullet and saying that it cannot be part of the solution as many want to.

There's room for compromise in between. But what I see is that the nuclear fanclub concentrates its efforts on dissing renewables, rather than pushing for the electrification of transport for example. Besides, that's what a compromise is made of: two positions that are exclusive if they are taken as a given. I'm open to include nuclear energy in that compromise, but only with hard guarantees that renewables won't be delegated to a cosmetic extra. So I'm not going to approve of funding a nuclear buildout campaign ""and we'll see about the rest later"".

&gt;I meant developing countries as Brazil, China, India. They surely are doing Nuclear.

Those are hardly developing, and they're using everything they can get their hands on. Hardly an example. In fact, most actually developing countries in places like Africa use solar panels because it's locally controlled and not dependent on a strong central government capable of providing the necessary stability to invest in a nuclear plant and run a national grid. It's a competive advantage of renewables.

I personally think that's common sense, and find it strange that this is a taboo and controversial subject in 2018, but whatever.

1) We know that gender identity is something that is stored in the brain and appears to be fairly rigid from birth. Age obviously isn't, as it changes during one's lifetime

2) There's some neurological evidence showing that brain structure of trans people aligns more with that of their gender identity than their physical sex.

With that in mind, and with evidence showing transitioning actually works to resolve issues with transgender, why focus rigidly on DNA? 

We know it can screw up, and it often does. Why is it unbelievable that in these cases, it screwed up when forming the brain.

1885,"&gt; some people have two heads

Unless we're counting Zaphod Beeblebrox, I'd argue they don't.

The only situation where you could say someone had ""two heads"" is when you have conjoined twins that are conjoined below the neck. And a list of these instances shows that in these cases [they are usually counted as two people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycephaly#Humans).

What OP's implication seems to be is that each body is counted as a person. Personhood is a fairly nebulous term, but realistically, two heads are two separate people, regardless of bodily conjoining. IMO, counting bodies not heads as people sounds a bit odd, and possibly even a bit insulting to those conjoined twins.

Now, if one of the twins died, for example, I'd say that it might be a point, but realistically, if one twin dies, either the head is going to be removed, the other is going to die, or both. The organ system seems unlikely to survive the death of one of the heads.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/9v8106/area_required_if_everyone_in_france_lived_as/e9at8hj/,CreatorRunning,1541695473

Do you think that the same didn't happen in Navarre?


Navarre wasn't allied with Castile, it was *conquered* by it (and Aragon), following orders from the king of Aragon.

But aside from that, bad laws will happen, perfection is not something that can reasonably be achieved out of the gate.

1938,"&gt;What make you say the French are worn out ? Or that the other nations are not combat ready? 

In order to be combat ready you need to have a least 2/3 of your military operational.

Just like the US military right now, the French military has not had much down time to perform routine maintenance.  F16 along with the Eurofighter need to have a frame up inspection after so many flight hours.  This has not been happening lately with all of the deployments causing both countries to only field 50% of our aircraft.  Vehicles are breaking down and soldiers are getting tired.

Germany does not have any operational submarines which are important in controlling the Baltic sea, only 40% of its tanks are operational, and the are having to use civilian helicopters for training.  

The UK has another 2 years before its aircraft carrier is ready.

The military across all countries need a 1 time infusion of money to get everything fixed.

&gt;What could really been improved is a common command and joint operation as well as uniformity in materials (preferably EU for obvious reasons) 

I know you don't want to hear this, but use the F-35 as an example of what can be accomplished with all countries working together.  I think this would be a good example of how it should move forward.  Depending on how much they put into R&amp;D determines how much of the manufacturing the country will receive.

1947,"You’ve got it twisted my friend - your own words give you away.

Negative National stereotypes come with the positives you can’t have one without the other - that’s not racist.

Grouping people on race and believing in racist negative stereotypes (stereotypes based not on fact but rather on the opinion of a race from the view of a racist) is a whole different cup of tea.

It wasn’t an equivalent analogy and the fact you think it was is worrying. To make that as clear as possible I gave equivalent analogies and explained why yours was not equivalent. Feel free to re-read them.

If you insist on having an equivalent analogy that specifically mentions race instead of nationality - my game of “spot the American” would be the equivalent of looking at a black guy and thinking “he’s black”.

You can most definitely use behaviours and apply them to real life as long as the behaviours you hold to be true  for a given group of people aren’t racist as fuck. And especially if it stops at identifying a black person.",,/r/europe/comments/9v4bm4/macron_stokes_anger_by_calling_petain_great_wwi/e9ak1kn/,BoringOldPaul,1541687973
1948,"&gt; And you neglect the fact that the one major reason for declining birth  rates in eastern europe is due to their young adults moving to western  europe and having kids there instead.  

*That still harms Eastern Europe's growth potential, driving up the costs of labor, and reducing their consumer base.* Furthermore even with inter-European economic migration, Western Europe, save for France have horrible demographics.

&gt; That aside, the whole western world is showing declining birth rates. In  fact industrialized nations all across the world show declining birth  rates, including those in asia. 

While true there is a vast difference in the ranges of declining birthrates. Just saying this masks just how bad the situation is:

[Portugal](https://www.indexmundi.com/graphs/population-pyramids/portugal-population-pyramid-2016.gif)

[France](https://www.indexmundi.com/graphs/population-pyramids/france-population-pyramid-2016.gif) is the only golden beacon of European Demographics, but alas just under 70 million people cannot support the entire 341 Million of the Eurozone.

Now compare that to the [US](https://www.indexmundi.com/graphs/population-pyramids/united-states-population-pyramid-2016.gif). Demographics won't be a problem. The US has a long future of being the largest consumer base with plenty of young people to consume.

Considering that Eastern Europe is **worse** then you have a colossal problem at hand. Such demographics inflate labor costs, reduces your potential consumer base, and increases the tax burden of welfare beneficiaries as there is a flood of retirees. In such an environment your high productive young professionals will flee as their effective costs of living skyrocket. We've seen this in Eastern Europe already. We'll next see it happen to the entire Eurozone.

Exports already account for ~47% of Germany GDP. With less young consumers, even with enormous amounts of automation the export reliance will increase. After all robots don't consume products. With the rest of Europe looking very similar you're going to find that an overwhelming amount of the future European economy will be reliant on exports.

That gives a lot of power to consumer economies.

For the record it's not just Europe, [China is in a similar pickle right now.](https://www.indexmundi.com/graphs/population-pyramids/china-population-pyramid-2016.gif) But China is far more incentivized as the CCP's very existence is dependent on them keeping their economy growing.

1967,"&gt; look, as long as we have this conversation in r/europe

Ad hominem. As if that is a sentiment only seen in this specific subreddit, also not addressing the point.

&gt; and I said that there can be degrees, yes, but that the situation is not the same as the UK/Scotland, I mantain spain/different nations are not mutually inclusive, even though degrees may exist.

You can't say they are mutually exclusive and then say there are varying degrees of self-identification with both at the same time. Then, another bunch of irrelevant stuff that doesn't address the point of people being able to identify as both.

&gt; using El Mundo as a source on spanish identities

Genetic fallacy. Not only is El Mundo not the source, just the one repeating it, I used it because it was literally the first result on Google Images.

&gt; and talking about ""peripheral"" and ""central"" nationalisms does seem to advocate for an identity line, precisely.

Strawman. Not my words and not words I'd have used, but they are pretty neutral. That also doesn't address the point.

&gt; I also gave you a source and you didn't comment on it, and it was much more recent and specific than yours.

Just a straight lie. I did comment on it.

&gt; and you don't get to tell me what I may or may not comment on.

Strawman. I didn't. I'm not trying to enforce what others may or may not feel, unlike you.

&gt; How do you know there are no Singaporeans who consider Singapore as their nation?

Strawman. I never said that.

&gt; Didn't you speak about degrees and that not everything is black and white??

I did. Again, not addressing the point or agreeing with me.

&gt; Has nigeria enforced an exclusive national identity in its history? has been this exclusivity a huge part on their state building? Because in spain it has, I mean until recently the royal house webpage was not even in Catalan, Basque or Galician, Spain has not make any movement to make Catalan an official language in the EU (somehting which the spanish government has to ask for) and spain does not allow for the national selection of the ""nationalities"" to participate in international sports events, something that other countries do. It is because it promotes an ""exclusive"" identity, not an inclusive one as in the UK. Then this creates problems and contradictions inside spain proper and the issues we are discussing about.

More irrelevant stuff. None of that addresses the point that people can identify as both Catalan and Spanish at the same time (not to mention there are bunch of lies there, but this is getting tiresome).

&gt; well in fact I get to say wathever I feel like saying on this topic, regarldess of your opinion.

2013,"&gt; And against them in the first, second, and third Carlist wars?

Against one side of the bourbons, so? BTW Catalonia was also in the wars, on the Carlista side too, and in some Cases, almost alone (Guerra dels Matiners), and we had the same goals as the Navarrese and supported Carlos for mostly the same reasons. 

&gt; Sure, but Navarre was one for longer, so claiming that Navarre had more to do with the Spanish empire than Catalonia is dumb.

Yeah, they went on longer because Navarre was **allied** with Castille, Catalonia and Navarre were at war in the 1702-1715, Navarre allied with France and Castile, we with England/UK, the Netherlands and Austria. It existed longer because it was a close ally of Castille for most of its history, that has nothing to do with the identity of the navarrese, or the language or anyting. 

Explorers, soldiers, administrators, colonists of all sorts, there was a big implication of Navarrese in the Empire, as navarrese from their own kingdom, not as Castillians. Catalonia did not participate in any of the empire wars (except in defense of its own territory) as its laws (Princeps Namque) excempted Catalans from fighting foreign wars and the people wasn't interested in joining the armies. 

How many people of navarrese and basque descent can you find in the excolonies of spain? The basque communities in the americas and the contacts with the local governments have been very important for the basque national liberation movement.

2025,"&gt; Giving benefits to only migrants would be discrimination so its a nice idea, but racist and illegal.

I'm sure i did not say a single word about that. I said we need to prevent Ghettos. That's not necessarily about benefits. Its about not to put all social living space into a few housing blocks but instead about spreading it across the country to prevent them from living all in the same spot.

&gt; Not just me, the immigrants know they are stuck at the bottom of the social ladder. Very proud and honorable cultures doomed to be at the ass-end of society, making little progress over multiple generations.

In my experience that's not true. But i cannot proof this through statistics. But I also don't see those ""20-30 years"" in your picture. I just see an snapshot of their average income, not their development over time. I also see that there are more ""Westers"" in the lowest income group then people from Morocco and Turkey.

&gt; All the migrants are at the bottom of society, and yes, your hypothetical white drugdealer does exist, he is a social outlier, whereas poor MENA immigrants are the norm, and the socioeconomic problems that come from that, and are the cause of native people moving away from those areas, making them worse and stuck in a vicious circle.

He is not hypothetical, trust me. :P 

As i said: i think the solution is to not concentrate social and cheap living space into one big house or area. Spread it out. I live in a neighborhood with around 10% Turks, 20% Poles, 20% from the Balkan region, some greeks and i'd say 40% germans. It's far from a ghetto and very lively.

Many want to see him super far on the right, but that's also not completely true: The biggest problem with him was the authoritarianism coupled with the racial theories, which back then weren't isolated to one particular side of the left-right spectrum.  


That's why it ain't as easy as simply locating the Nazis in the far right, conflating the modern far right with neo-Nazism. These are groups and views that at times overlap, but they still disagree on many different issues from economic to social.

&gt; do you consider those who identify themselves as both Catalans and Spaniards as being less Catalans than you?

That would not be the question, the question would be wether they consider Catalonia to be a nation, independently of what they think about spain (wether spain is a nation or not i mean). If someone lives in Catalonia and don't consider Catalonia a nation but a province or region of spain (legally speaking it would be wrong since, unlike say, murcia, Catalonia is a ""nationality/nation"", not a *region*) then off course he is not a Catalan but a spaniard living in Catalonia and I'm sur the person in question thinks the same as I.

Can we settle this by considering that for me (and milions of Catalans) there is a difference between nationality and citizenship? My citizenship is spanish (by now) since I have a spanish passport, my nationality is Catalan though. If I went to live to South Korea permanently and did all the process I could acquire a Korean passport, and if I decided to renounce to the spanish one, I would be a person with korean citizenship and catalan nationality. 

If Catalonia gets independence then my citizenship and my nationality will be the same. Hope that is clear",Catalan Republic,/r/europe/comments/9v882s/catalan_police_capture_a_far_right_lone_wolf/e9ad56y/,Toc_a_Somaten,1541680667

2100,"1) I am not sure I understand how your history gets eradicated? The deal only had clauses for ancient Macedonian history not modern. I don't remember reading anything about what you said but perhaps I'm wrong. Do you have any sources? Even modern far right parties in Greece don't care about that part of your history. It's the ancient history they are worried about (as if they have a claim anyway....bunch of uneducated dictatorsahip lovers anyway). 

2) ""deal defines our people as being exclusively linked to this land"" -&gt; since you are not the only Macedonians why is that wrong? The modern definition of Macedonia includes areas from Greece, North Macedonia, Bulgaria and Albania and the citizens if these countries are not associated with your people. Bulgarian Macedonians feel Bulgarian, Greek Macedonians feel Greek etc. Besides, there are minorities everywhere in the Balkans including in your country. There are lots of Greeks in Bitola for example who fled there during the Greek civil war. I even have relatives in Skopje. It's very difficult to find who is right and who is wrong when it comes to situations like this. Within a united Europe though such problems cease to exist. 

3) From the top of my head I remember that your language and everything is described as ""Macedonian"" in the deal. Perhaps when describing something to a foreigner it's better to add a geographical term to help them understand the difference between the regions. For example, if I talk about Greek Macedonian dances I might refer to them as ""South Macedonian"". Remember, you are not the only ones to reside in the region of Macedonia. 

4) Free speech censorship when it comes to such agreements is a very complex thing to decide. Yes you can still call yourselves whatever you want and trust me you won't be jailed or tried. The issue was that your country chose to do so ignoring the fact that there are other Macedonians in the region that do not wish to be associated with or have their identities replaced by yours. Your government tried to monopolise the term ""Macedonian"" when the region belongs to 4 different countries with 4 distinct macedonian identities. We could sit down and argue who is right and wrong all day about ""national identity"" when it is in fact a term invented in the last 200 years. What will we gain from it? Nothing. At least this deal allows you to be called ""Macedonians from North Macedonia"" which is technically correct since you live there and I'm pretty sure a linguist who can't differentiate between the languages and dialects spoken in the region of Macedonia should be jailed. Greek, Bulgarian, Turkish and Albanian have been spoken in Macedonia for centuries. Are they not ""Macedonian"" too?

5) As for the bribes and jailing I agree with you. In general I think the main issue with the Greeks was the ""ancient history"" part. As long as your government disassociate from these no one cares what you call yourselves. The statues in Skopje though was a PR disaster from your side. Sadly your government played directly into the hands of the Greeks who for years said that ""FYROM had irredentist plans for the region"" which foreign powers denied. After the statues North Macedonia lost its moral standpoint and basically proved the Greeks right giving them the upper hand in negotiations hence the americans' direct involvement in the referendum. This deal however is arguably the best both sides could get. Its fair for all in my opinion. ",,/r/europe/comments/9pntpt/macedonian_parliament_approves_countrys_name/e9a8oj6/,coditaly,1541673052

But yes, you're right, we would need to ask him nonetheless. Let him explain. If he considers himself a Catalan —which is a big if—, what's that about in his mind.

You know how these people usually go ""yes I'm a Catalan and a Spaniard"" or vice versa. But then when you ask them what's their Catalan identity about, and it can just go: ""That's just the territory I live in"" or ""Catalonia as part of Spain"". They have no link, appreciation or respect whatsoever to the Catalan culture, identity or territory, they show contempt for the language (which they may refuse to speak even after a lifetime of living here), and while they love their Spanish nationalism, they may call Catalans ""nationalists"" by default. They're basically catalanophobes.

This is also present with the Basque identities, but (imo) it's smaller because there's less dissonance with the mainstream Spanish imaginary. Basque traditions, imagery, and character is closer to that of Spaniards, so a Spaniard over there will be more prone to accept them as their own, and call themselves proudly a Basque and be able to explain to you all the good things they enjoy of the Basque culture and territory.

Over here, however, the same person will get away from anything Catalan like it's cancer —because in many things, Catalan and Castillian identities aren't that compatible. The national dissonance is over the top.

Anyway, this comes as an insult to people like me, personally, that someone who holds no respect for the Catalan culture or language appropiates themselves of the same demonym as me. Honestly feels like colonisation.

Now, there is no doubt that Russia did cause the attack, especially since the suspects were confirmed Russian military much later, and European leaders did the right thing backing them despite the own goal, but to be honest siding with Russia on anything even if the British had zero evidence would have been unthinkable anyway.

The hilarious part in this article is that the Russian FSB is now trying to spin this as a successfull British missinformation coup using the one great british trait: their arrogance. The british media have taken to calling the attack ""laughable"" and ""incompetent"" despite British inteligence being caught with their pants down and only medical technology and competence saving the day. And, tabloid media being what it is, the stories do become a bit manic as they obsessivly revisit the incident.

Scotland is a nation, it is not a *sovereign* nation, it cannot decide what it does without the permission from the UK government. 

The second article of the spanish constitution makes the point of marking the difference between a *region* and a *nationality*

The statute of autonomy of Catalonia (an organic law second only to the spanish constitution) further clarifies that Catalonia is a *nation*, and this point was not axed from the reform of 2006. 

&gt; Scotland and England are two clearly distinct entities

and Catalonia is also a distinct entity, and the Basque Country and Navarre are distinct entities, so what? What do you mean by ""distinct entity""? Are you gonna get into a historical tirade? 

With the law in hand, all scots and all the english have the same passport, there is no dedicated Scottish or Welsh passports, the UK is **not** a federal state, just like spain, the difference being in the nomenclature and protocolary treatement (and transfered competences) but the differences are less than the commonalities in the status of Scotland within the UK and Catalonia within spain. 

Then you can go by how people identify identity wise, which would be the most important factor in a nation without state and without sovereignity, which is the case of Catalonia *and* Scotland. In this case, the latest official poll from CEO says that 64% of Catalans identify as Catalans living in Catalonia or Catalans living in spain, then less than a third identify themselves as a somewhat dual Catalan/Spanish identity and then you have a small minority of around 6.4% who think of themselves as ""spaniards living in spain"".

You really need to take a step back and reexaminate your beliefs when you literally think that people with opinions  you don't like are insane.

When you think people with opinions you dislike are insane, mistreating them is not that far away: it is for their own good after all.

Society is the problem, not transgenderism, and when people blame transgenderism to justify further stigmatisation they create a self-fulfilling prophecy.

If you look back several decades, a lot of LGB people struggled with a similar illness to gender dysphoria, and many LGB people committed suicide. That very rarely happens anymore, because LGB people do not face the level of social stigma and discrimination they used to.

2305,"&gt; no. not liking a religion is not an excuse for trying to prevent it from existing. we're not in the 13th century (or the 1940s!) anymore.

Obviously that's just your opinion.  A silly one, but there you go.

Not liking a religion is a great reason to oppose its spread.

&gt; the number of radical extremists is just a very, very small percentage of the total number of Muslims in the world

I really wonder why you consider to be a radical extremist.

&gt; as long as they aren't attempting (or planning to) to kill anyone, they're not radical.

Ah, so wanting atheists to be killed isn't radical in your mind?

Well that certainly explains why you think most Muslims aren't radical extremist!

&gt; you can't just go out there assuming stuff.

It was a question of **you** consider to be radical.  But you answered it.  Wanting apostates killed is not radical in your warped ind.

&gt; stop treating Muslims like products. you don't ""import"" them, they're people, too. 

You know the UK literally did import them?  As in, literally went out there, put them on planes and flew them in?

&gt; you have no reason whatsoever to hate Muslims, yet you do. why?

Because unlike you, I think wanting apostates killed is an extreme idea that we should oppose.

Only in case of Crimea there is an interpretation of Russia “invading” a country, which is debatable. I perosonally see it as an infriendly act against Ukraine, rather than act of war, that is, recognizing independence and soveranity of another country territory.

In case of Chechnya we talk about an internal matter, in both Chechen wars Russian army presence was justified: during first Chechen war to prevent a genocide of non-Chechen population, during second to repeal and prevent further attacks after Chechen forces invaded Dagestan.

While in Moldova and Georgia acts of Russian military should be considered as acting in enforcement of the International Law and were much more substantieted than for example, NATO involvement in Yugoslavia.

He prooved there are simple tools to enforce the Europen law and protect the outside borders so the inner ones can stay open which is the point of schengen area. Half million of them marched through us in 3 months, we barely see a dozen these days on our borders. That means stopped, not redirected. Why? Because it is written in the schengen law to protect outside borders, and if every outside border country would act according to the law they signed up for, there would be no hole for them to be redirected to. 

It's not his responsibility or in Hungary's in general to help solve the issues that were caused by countries who held colonies in Africa and intervened in the past decades too by aiding several wars, removing the leaders of countries that held back extremeists and terrorists so something like ISIS could never have become as strong as murdering hundreds of thousands of people. Yet Orbán wants to send help, and been doing so for the 3 past years since the migration started, precisely to stop people risking their lives, their children's lives, give up their fate and wealth to smugglers to get a shitty boat and hope not to die on the way.

We don't believe he stopped it, he stopped them coming to us. Going through us. Trashing the highway and fields, robbing old people and raping women on the way so they have a good fuck before they attack the next truck to hide in. We had half million of them pass through Hungary, and this is what they did. If you deny it, you disrespect the real innocent victims, period. He put a stop to THAT. They don't come to us anymore, because they can't pass the border illegally anymore, there is a fence and soldiers behind it waiting for them to enforce they pass through the legal gates, where they require to show their documents or get identified otherwise, as it is the EUROPEAN LAW. A law France and Germany keep shitting on and inviting people to themselves, just to then send them away back to other European countries, based on who they like and who they don't like. That is what causing the conflict between V4+Austria and the liberalist western politicans. You want to invite them in? Fine, but you KEEP THEM. You don't have the right to tell us it is our duty to live with them once you decided you don't want this family or that family, because they are uneducated and/or violent. That is what France and Germany does and tries to use the eastern EU countries as a dumpster. Fuck that, and fuck them. What Hungary does is keep offering help for border protection to all outside border countries and trying to raise a funds fairly shared by all countries to send help where HELP IS NEEDED, where they are migrating FROM, instead of importing the problems the core of that society holds that lead to the situation.

You know they kind of problems like a christian woman voicing his opinion that he dislikes islam, so she is on deathrow for 8 years now, and there are tens of thousands of these ""all separated cases, peaceful people"" marching on the street, protesting to get her executed after the judge said she is to be spared. Yeah, thanks, you can keep them if you want those people in your homes, don't send them to us. 

Our share in sharing this burden is paid by none other by the hungarian tax payers who get precisely 0 support from the EU for border protection, while the costs of that went above 400 million euros already for us, a country that pays 4-5x times less for the same jobs compared to Germany if you want to get the idea just how much work Hungary puts into stopping them. If the schengen border countries would all do the same - and thank god the new leadership of Itality for example came to it's senses - we can stop the migration by making it impossible to come in ILLEGALLY.

As long as Merkel and Macron says, ""oh sure come in without your documents, the authorities have to believe what you say, and the doctors are forbidden from telling your age so might aswell lie yourself a minor while you are closer to 30 than 20"", that is an INVITATION. Orbán fights in EU politics so people like them stop sending out that message, yet all they do is try to legalize illegal immigration. They speak of border management, not border protection.

2455,"TRANSLATION

&amp;#x200B;

Even in the first half of the 21st century, Poland will become the main force in the region - writes George Friedman, an American political scientist, founder and president of Geopolitical Futures.

To understand the future, one must begin by understanding the past. Poland lies on the North European Plain, which extends from France through Germany far into Russia. This plain is extensive, flat and - with the exception of some rivers - has no natural borders that could provide protection for individual countries. It is therefore an area of ​​wars and related national victories and defeats.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The reunification of Germany in 1871 severely disturbed the balance of forces on the plain. The Germans were strong economically, but unstable in military terms, so they could not survive a simultaneous and coordinated attack from Russia and France. To avoid such a situation, they had to trigger a war, hoping to defeat France or Russia, and then enter into a deal with the other of these countries. Both in the first and the second world wars, this strategy failed, which led the Russians to penetrate the West, deeper into Germany, far more than ever before, while the Americans began to play a permanent role in Europe, blocking the Soviets on the great plain.

&amp;#x200B;

In the twentieth century, Poland became the battlefield between Germany and the Russians. In the twentieth century, it was a sovereign state only about 30 years. It survived as a nation, but it did not have statehood, and a nation without a state is a nation that has no choice. It happened that Poland was a power on the Northern European Plain and subjugated the fate of other nations. It also happened that her fate was dependent on others. In this sense, the fate of Poland depended on the strength of other nations. Victory or the fall of others marked the victory or fall of Poland.

&amp;#x200B;

GERMANY: POWER AND WEAKNESS

Today, in the immediate field of interest of contemporary Poland, there are two nations: Germany and Russia. The most important not only for Poland, but also for the whole of Europe, and in a sense for the whole world, is for these two forces to be weakened. After reunification, Germany became an economically strong state, but weak in military terms. This may sound strange to a state whose forces have been effective and ruthless, and at one point they have dominated the area from France to the Volga. It should be remembered, however, that in both wars they have launched, the Germans have been ruthlessly defeated. Their defeat had two reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

First of all, the plain in Russia is vast, and the German troops lacked the strength to defeat it. Secondly, intervention from outside Europe proved decisive in both wars. Today, Germany is in a very dangerous situation: rich, but weak. This weakness consists of two elements. On the one hand, the Germans do not have enough military capabilities to defend themselves, so they base their national security on the assumption that nobody will attack them. This is a dubious assumption when it comes to the North European Plain. On the other hand, the German economy is based on export, and all exporters are hostages of their clients. If customers can not buy, Germany will not be able to sell, and if Germany can not sell, they will be ruined. The Germans emerged from both wars with great prosperity and with great weakness. The weakness that other countries will definitely use.

&amp;#x200B;

RUSSIA: LOST SPACE

Russia's military potential has been weakened in strategic terms. Russia has always defended itself through strategic space. She did not have - as the Germans - serious problems with a double front. A large part of this space has been disassembled. The Baltic countries belong to NATO and are allies of the USA. Ukraine is ruled by anti-Russian forces. Only Belarus balances between Russia and its opponents. Russia has lost its greatest military strengths - space and time - and now has to compensate them with direct military force.

&amp;#x200B;

An obstacle in creating military potential is the economy. During the cold war, the Russians did not manage to build a modern economy that could support the military. The need to finance defense spending combined with the drop in oil prices has become the main factor in the breakup of the Soviet Union. Also, after 1992 in Russia nothing has changed in this respect - the economy retains the characteristics of the Third World, based mainly on the export of raw materials, especially oil, at prices that the Russians are unable to control. Since 1945, they have not seized the opportunity to build a modern economy twice, and now they have to face the loss of their satellites, in addition with the military strength they can afford economically.

&amp;#x200B;

EUROPE UNDER THE USA CURLET

This disproportion of economic and military potentials - elements that lie at the very heart of the nation state - affects both Polish neighbors. One of them has a strong economy (but with very weak points), but does not have an effective defense. The second is economically weak, but it must maintain military potential disproportionately high in relation to the economic condition.

&amp;#x200B;

The shortcomings of Poland's greatest antagonists, which undermine their strength, make it a historic moment for the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. It is not only a national state in the full sense of the word, but in addition its interests coincide with the interests of the world power, the United States.

&amp;#x200B;

It would seem that the US does not have a clearly outlined foreign strategy. But that's not true - US foreign policy since 1900 is strictly focused on two goals. First of all, North America is an island. The United States must control the Northwest Atlantic and the Eastern Pacific. After the Second World War, the Americans gained control over the Atlantic, Pacific and other waters. Second, the US's goal is to prevent a power from gaining control over both the European continent and Russia. American domination at sea became possible due to the lack of an enemy fleet, and the best way to avoid confrontation at sea is not to flee. Meanwhile, the consolidation of Europe under one leadership would open the door to its creation.

&amp;#x200B;

The United States intervened during the First World War several weeks after the Tsar's abdication. They understood that German troops would be thrown into the fight against France, and the Anglo-French forces could be defeated. In 1917 and 1918, the United States sent a million soldiers to prevent a German victory. Similarly, during the Second World War, after the defeat of France, the US helped the Soviet Union to block and weaken Germany, then invaded Northern France and the North European Plain to help defeat the Third Reich. During the Cold War, the US focused on preventing the Soviet Union from invading Western Europe. For more than 40 years they have been a counterbalance to the Russian forces in Germany and elsewhere.

&amp;#x200B;

This approach worked well after 2008 and the Russo-Georgian war, slowly transforming into a strategy that became established after 2014, when the US deployed its troops in Poland and Romania. Compared with the Cold War period, these forces were relatively few, but - just like American tactics - effective at any given time. Currently, Russia is relatively weak, and the neighboring countries are no longer under its control. However, the policy continued since 1900 is still in use - when there is a threat from hegemon in Europe, the US reacts.

&amp;#x200B;

Currently, the idea of ​​Międzymorze is created by marshal Józef Piłsudski, which was created in opposition to both Germany and Russia. Location on the North European Plain is a constant threat to Poland, which is why extending the alliance to the south gives it new strategic opportunities. The deployment of US soldiers in Poland and Romania provides Poland with not only military security but also free space for developing regional relations and for its own economy.

&amp;#x200B;

UNCERTAIN FUTURE OF THE UNION

Germany is not the whole EU, but it plays a leading role in it, and the EU becomes an incoherent institution. It is fighting hard against Great Britain. It is the second largest economy in Europe, and therefore the absence of trade agreements with the EU may cause at least as much damage to the EU as to the United Kingdom. And the free trade agreement with Great Britain will meet with little opposition in the USA. The Union is conducting these talks with a strange emphasis on intimidation. It uses this tactic not only towards Great Britain, but also against Italy, Hungary, Poland and even Switzerland, which is not part of the European customs union. At the same time, the EU is isolating the US, constantly imposing legal sanctions on US technology companies, which may be aimed at preserving the European market for German companies.

&amp;#x200B;

This should be seen as a fundamental and insoluble problem for the EU. Promising prosperity, it does not provide it to Southern Europe because it does not even have such opportunities. The national interests of individual European countries prevail over international commitments that are unclear. Importantly, after 2008, the Union could not solve problems with banks (German banks are exceptionally weak compared to others) or social problems.

&amp;#x200B;

In this situation, it is not only the future of the Union that is unclear, but also how the Germans will cope with the weakness of exports, instability of domestic politics or the role of a leader in Europe. Since NATO is no longer an effective military alliance, since most of its members do not have military capabilities, the trans-European institutions are in crisis. Most countries assume that they will overcome difficulties. Considering that they have not been resolved over the last ten years, it seems reasonable to doubt they would do so in the next decade.

&amp;#x200B;

EXAMPLES FROM HISTORY

Therefore, Poland has no choice but to take its fate into its own hands. It is a national state, fully sovereign, with social stability, which is lacking in other areas, where Brussels claims to have the right to interfere in the sovereignty of member countries. In addition, there are economic reasons for the relations between Poland and the USA.

&amp;#x200B;

It is worth mentioning the economic success of Japan, Germany and South Korea thanks to the fact that these countries were strategically important for the USA. The development of these countries was supported and supported, as they formed a major part of the American national strategy. In 1950, at the beginning of the Korean War, 500 trucks were urgently needed and there was no time to bring them back from the United States. A small Japanese car company was able to fulfill this order. Her name was Toyota, the rest was history.

&amp;#x200B;

In all cases, the economies of these countries were in disarray, in all cases they were needed by the United States, in all cases they became global economic powers. Starting from buying local goods and hiring local employees, through joint ventures, technology transfers and preferential access to the US market - thanks to this, these three countries have revived. Strategic military relations with the United States have obvious benefits. We can see that this is happening and this phenomenon will get stronger.

&amp;#x200B;

OLD AND NEW ESTABLISHMENTS

In military terms, Germany does not exist, they are economically strong, but they also face serious problems. Russia relies on the export of raw materials, and the condition of its armed forces disproportionately exceeds the state of the economy. Both countries lost their position twice in the 20th century and to some extent regained their strength. None of them, however, is able to build on the hitherto achievements, and the strategy to protect what has already been achieved, rather will not allow them to maintain their position.

&amp;#x200B;

Inconsistent EU is seriously threatening the German economy. It also threatens other European countries, but Germany can feel it most painfully, while countries such as Poland - predicting problems and deftly seeking solutions - can cope with these difficulties. Russia did not solve the basic problem that led to the overthrow of tsarism, during the Second World War it almost destroyed the Soviet Union, and in 1992 led to its collapse. Russia lacks the institutional possibilities to create a modern economy on a global scale, but it must have a modern, world-class army.

&amp;#x200B;

Poland is finally a national state, has its place on the North European Plain and a powerful strategic partner, and Russia and Germany are weakened. Poland found itself in a unique situation. It should also be remembered that to maintain stability, it must have an economic and military ally. The United States can play a role here, but it is not decisive. And here comes the idea of ​​Międzymorze (Intermarium), the initiative of the Tri-Sea or some other structure. However, this must be an alliance of nation states that decide to join it, because it suits their interests and each of them wants to bear burdens without losing his sovereignty.

&amp;#x200B;

THE PROCESS HAS ALREADY STARTED

When such a group is created and the EU is defined anew, Poland will be the greatest strength due to the size and awareness of its role. Safe on the North European Plain, it will become the main player in the alliance of the two seas (Baltic and Black), and perhaps also the third (Adriatic).

&amp;#x200B;

Even in the first half of the 21st century, Poland will become the main force in the region. Its impact will extend north to the Baltic States and to the Black Sea to the south. This does not mean any structure that will be under the control of Warsaw - they will be independent states whose interests will be in line with Polish ones. It will be a sphere of influence rather than an empire.

&amp;#x200B;

Being a significant player on the plain and a powerful force in the north and south as well as the country with the largest population and the strongest economy, Poland will have huge influence in the region. Other forces, such as Turkey, will also strengthen, and the Balkans will come to known conflicts, but Poland will be able to control them.

&amp;#x200B;

For a state that has not been sovereign for most of its existence, this perspective seems absurd. One of the certainties of geopolitics, however, is that the superpowers arise and fall. In the twentieth century, we saw how the United Kingdom lost its empire and became a secondary force; we have seen the United States change from a distant and marginal player into a dominant world power, and China is moving away from imperial domination and civil war and becoming the homogeneous force they currently have. We have seen Russia become a powerful world power and shrinks to its present state. If in 1980 I said that Poland would become independent from Russia and become a significant member of NATO, everyone would laugh at it, as now many may laugh at the above predictions.

&amp;#x200B;

The constant victories and falls of states are, however, an inseparable part of universal history and they are constantly surprising everyone. And they should not, because the only constant is that there is nothing constant. The expectation that Poland will still be a vassal of Russia was thoroughly wrong. The expectation that it will still remain between weakened Germany and Russia is also unlikely. It is difficult to discern in detail the nature of this process. But the fact that this is already happening is not an obviousness, but a real reality

2461,"As I said depleted uranium also decays into lead so some of the toxic effects of it can also be attributed to the toxicity of lead. There is no amount of lead nor of ionizing radiation which are not harmful to human health. Effects vary and increase in severity by the amount, kind and duration of exposure. You've made it clear that you don't really care about the effects that warfare has on people in the short and long-term, so I don't expect you to know much about nor take toxicology, epidemiology and medical developmental science seriously.
 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_poisoning

Reproductive system

Lead affects both the male and female reproductive systems. In men, when blood lead levels exceed 40 μg/dL, sperm count is reduced and changes occur in volume of sperm, their motility, and their morphology.[61] A pregnant woman's elevated blood lead level can lead to miscarriage, prematurity, low birth weight, and problems with development during childhood.[62] Lead is able to pass through the placenta and into breast milk, and blood lead levels in mothers and infants are usually similar.[24] A fetus may be poisoned in utero if lead from the mother's bones is subsequently mobilized by the changes in metabolism due to pregnancy; increased calcium intake in pregnancy may help mitigate this phenomenon.[63]

Nervous system

Lead affects the peripheral nervous system (especially motor nerves) and the central nervous system.[24] Peripheral nervous system effects are more prominent in adults and central nervous system effects are more prominent in children.[29] Lead causes the axons of nerve cells to degenerate and lose their myelin coats.[24]

Lead exposure in young children has been linked to learning disabilities,[65] and children with blood lead concentrations greater than 10 μg/dL are in danger of developmental disabilities.[32] Increased blood lead level in children has been correlated with decreases in intelligence, nonverbal reasoning, short-term memory, attention, reading and arithmetic ability, fine motor skills, emotional regulation, and social engagement.[62]

The effect of lead on children's cognitive abilities takes place at very low levels.[43][62][66] There is apparently no lower threshold to the dose-response relationship (unlike other heavy metals such as mercury).[67] Reduced academic performance has been associated with lead exposure even at blood lead levels lower than 5 μg/dL.[68][69] Blood lead levels below 10 μg/dL have been reported to be associated with lower IQ and behavior problems such as aggression, in proportion with blood lead levels.[12] Between the blood lead levels of 5 and 35 μg/dL, an IQ decrease of 2–4 points for each μg/dL increase is reported in children.[32] However, studies that show associations between low-level lead exposure and health effects in children may be affected by confounding and overestimate the effects of low-level lead exposure.[70]

High blood lead levels in adults are also associated with decreases in cognitive performance and with psychiatric symptoms such as depression and anxiety.[71] It was found in a large group of current and former inorganic lead workers in Korea that blood lead levels in the range of 20–50 μg/dL were correlated with neuro-cognitive defects.[72] Increases in blood lead levels from about 50 to about 100 μg/dL in adults have been found to be associated with persistent, and possibly permanent, impairment of central nervous system function.[53]

Lead exposure in children is also correlated with neuropsychiatric disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and anti-social behaviour.[66] Elevated lead levels in children are correlated with higher scores on aggression and delinquency measures.[5] A correlation has also been found between prenatal and early childhood lead exposure and violent crime in adulthood.[62] Countries with the highest air lead levels have also been found to have the highest murder rates, after adjusting for confounding factors.[5] A May 2000 study by economic consultant Rick Nevin theorizes that lead exposure explains 65% to 90% of the variation in violent crime rates in the US.[73][74] A 2007 paper by the same author claims to show a strong association between preschool blood lead and subsequent crime rate trends over several decades across nine countries.[75][76] Lead exposure in childhood appears to increase school suspensions and juvenile detention among boys.[77] It is believed that the U.S. ban on lead paint in buildings in the late 1970s, as well as the phaseout of leaded gasoline in the 1970s and 1980s, partially helped contribute to the decline of violent crime in the United States since the early 1990s.[76] ",,/r/europe/comments/9um6qs/with_nuclear_instead_of_renewables_california/e99y6h8/,[deleted],1541654728

&gt;  
&gt;Just over an hour later, all the people who were aboard the frigate evacuated. None of them should be seriously injured.

&gt;  
&gt;He says there are very many boats in the area that contribute in the rescue operation.

Nationalism means belief in the existence of nations and being proud of your own. Nationalism is not chauvinism! It's not about saying ""Poland is better than Germany"". It's about saying ""Poland is great"".

In 1918 Poland regained independence and at the helm there was the Sanation movement. A SOCIALIST movement.

Where have you gotten the part about superiority? It's not about superiority. Lies spread by the political elite and media. It's about being proud of being Polish. You can be proud about being Norwegian. And I can see you are since you like the way you do things. You have an appreciation for how you run things in Norway. You are proud that you celebrate in ""Norwegian way"". 

And the only thing you want to do is to play the role of the man who knows better how Poles want to live in Poland and how Poles should celebrate. You also seem to know better how the Independence March looked like. From media. Instead from people who actually go there.

I have no problem with the way you run your country and how you celebrate. That's great!

But kindly fuck off from our celebrations, thank you.

Because Islam is terrible and shitty religion, at a time when we want the country to become secular.

And many people don't want to be a minority in their town.

&gt; is it just plain islamophobia

We should be afraid of Islam.

&gt; minority of them is radicalized

Have you seen the polls of british muslim beliefs?

&gt; in the past, the Catholic Church literally traveled around the world (including to my country) imposing their religion and killing or enslaving everyone that refused to be converted,

On the plus side, they actually opposed Islam.  For all its many many faults, I would prefer Catholism over Islam.

&gt; and that the Catholic Church is less violent than other religions

Glad you agree - so why would you want to spread an even worse religion?

&gt; I'm actually atheist

Now what do you think Muslims believe about atheists?  How are atheists treated in Muslim countries?

Answer me this:

Would you prefer to be openly atheist today in a Muslim country or a Christian country?

&gt; the number of radicalized Muslims is just a small percentage of the total number of Muslims

That contradicts your statement ""the Catholic Church is less violent than other religions"", or do you think that being less violent doesn't make it better?

But either way, even if they are all equally bad (which is pretty ridiculous), do you think Islam is equally as bad as atheism?  If not, then that alone is an argument against spreading Islam in Europe.

&gt; why? sounds exactly like plain islamophobia to me.

You agree that it's shitty and terrible, but don't agree that we should be afraid of it's spread?  How does that work?

&gt; no. what's wrong with the polls of British Muslims?

&gt; did the polls explicitly asked the Muslims wether they were radical or not? I'm sure it didn't

If a Muslim said that they think homosexuality should be illegal, or that apostates should be killed, would you say that they are radical?

Or do you think the only way to determine if a Muslim is radical is by asking if they are radical, and believing them if they say they are not?

2582,"&gt; For the avoidance of doubt, I did not intend my post to come across be some fingerwagging anti European rant OK :) although yes I am a Brit, and yes I acknowledge that we Brits are certainly not immune to defence related procurement screwups - we have had plenty.

Mostly made the reference to the Type 45 to show that even when a project is only done by a single nation for its own military, the delays and race to the bottom in terms of numbers ordered still exist. 

&gt;The real issue with the Bombardier dispute is that the US-Canadian strategic partnership is simply not as strong as the relationship between US politicians, Boeing and US Workers. As has been seen - in a contest between Boeing and Canada Boeing always comes first, and as we have seen US aerospace markets are anything but free and open. Just like what happened with Concorde all over again...

That depends on how bad it really gets. For now the partnership is strained but not unfixable and I am more than confident that, should the next US administration be more 'reasonable', things will return to normal very quickly. 

&gt;Sweden is going to need 6th generation fighters eventually for credible home defence, just like the UK eventually will. A 4.5 gen fighter will simply not a credible deterrent in a world of 5th and 6th generation aircraft.

Their requirements are not the same however. Sweden is very happy to have an agile, single-engine defense fighter while the UK requires a twin-engine long-range strike aircraft and air superiority fighter. Those two are very different requirements which can not be combined into one, unfortunately. 

&gt;I am aware yes that BAE are building the new warships in Australia - but they are ultimately based (at least partially) upon a UK design, so that's definitely a win for the UK and a vote of confidence in UK shipbuilding especially since the first type 26 has not yet been launched.

Since the only two other competitors were Italy and Spain, it is not entirely unsurprising that Australia would choose BAE (and with it, the UK) due to the global infrastructure and the fact that BAE is always happy to build wherever it is needed - something that might not have been as feasible for the spanish and italian equivalents. 

&gt;Its really unfortunate for the german naval shipbuilders (Siemens??) i know they've had some horrendous issues with the latest subs for the Kriegsmarine as I understand it having some pretty serious sounding design flaws.

Well, it hasn't been called 'Kriegsmarine' for almost 80 years now - regardless, the submarines are fine and some of the best non-nuclear subs (if not the best) in the world. The only issue being that, as with everything, someone decided to stop ordering replacement parts which took forever to get from the industry on custom order. 

&gt;I also heard the SU-57 has partially exposed engine fan blades, which if true suggests that it's hardly a proper stealth jet at all.

Thats a relatively minor fix. The make-or-break will be whether Russia is willing to share the plans and blueprints of the SU-57 with India in the end. If not, then there will likely be no deal.

2609,"De Gaulle would leave to England and call for men to join him. A few hundreds at first, he was alone and most of the squattered remnant of the Army would go back to France to their families, as the battle was lost and De Gaulle was merely an obscure colonel that had a few success on the field and was recently appointed general. In 1940 he is virtually alone, the colonial empire and the traditional minded Navy followed the new Vichy State and it would take time to rally some parts of the Empire to his cause.

The first resistants are mostly nationalists which makes sense. Some may think ""far right may likes far right"". Well, most of the French, nationalists even more, who grew up between the 1870 and 1920 got the idea the German was France's enemy and WWI didn't help much. At the time French Nationalism means German as enemy and impossible collaboration.

De Gaulle would need months to gather different resistance networks into one and to gather forces and colonial institutions under his authority and even until 1943 it would be disputed by the American and other high ranking French military officiers. So from the few hundreds with him in London in 1940 to the 1,4 million army in 1945, he and others had to expand the pseudo army in northern Africa under Leclerc, through the fact that the British bombed the French Fleet in Mers El Kebir giving credit to Pétain, to the campaign  of Egypt, Italy, Corsica and Dragoon until Tassigny in Germany commanding French and US troops... there was a world to cross.",,/r/europe/comments/9v4j4x/emmanuel_macron_under_fire_for_calling_nazi/e99geio/,Simpledream91,1541637229

2711,"&gt;you would be a liar if you were to state that there isnt any (bigotry) towards Muslims here on this sub.

Indeed I would be. I do have eyes.

&gt;my problem is with the generalisations, instead of picking the actual problems.

I believe there to be an actual problem with a rather large portion of the muslim community, not just its most violent members. It is great me and the muslim folks I know share a hatred for ISIS. It is however an enormous problem that they do see a problem with being gay and put being muslim before being a citizen. It isn't my duty nor plan to compromise on those topics. 

Feel free to call out simplistic black-white thinking. But the nuanced reality is still bad enough that many people will demand more from muslims than just to have a job. Pretty much any statistic comparing the social views of muslims and non-muslims is worrying. You know it and I do.

The situation is quite different across the different plants of Fukushima. They have different camera, some being [hanged](http://www.fukuleaks.org/web/?p=15095), other more rigid through a [pipe](http://www.fukushima-blog.com/2017/02/du-nouveau-au-reacteur-2-de-fukushima-daiichi.html) (yeh, in French, because I'm lazy, but you get plenty pf pictures), or mobile like the youtube video.    

There are several questions, but they basically boil down to ""where is what?"". How did the pressure vessel reacted; where did the fuel go; where did other component went; what are the dose rate, where; what is the chemical form of everything; how easily will it be to remove them, etc.    

I'm not sure if ""beauty"" is the world I would use.   
Being a nuclear engineer, I'm like a surgeon doing surgery on lung cancer patients: you don't want to have to deal with me more than you really need to. I wouldn't talk about the ""beauty"" of lung surgery.    

If you're interested, I guess those who would best find something to your taste are the [Nuclear Institute Young Generation Network](https://www.nuclearinst.com/Communities/NI-Young-Generation-Network). Or drop an email to the nuclear engineering department of your closest university.   

I hope that my initial post has also convinced you to remain critical. You will easily find on the Internet stories that will be pleasing to your ears, how your favorite pet technology is the silver bullet that everybody else fail  to see. Be even more suspicious of the story you like. Go check the data, do the math, show it around and never fear of having someone else redo it, or present you with other data.

Or learn from history (a few countries were able to build large amounts of nuclear back in the 70s and 80s)? Maybe we need to change regulations? Priorities have to be made. Huge subsidies are probably needed. We need something similar to a new Apollo program. Right now there's simply no technological answer to how we're supposed to handle intermittent nature of renewable energy and we need to use technology that is available today. The fear of nuclear power is largely irrational and has to go away. Just as the right wing has to drop the skepticism towards climate change, the left wing has to drop its irrational fears about nuclear power. In it's latest report, the IPCC suggest that the amount of nuclear should increase between 98% and 501%.

2864,"&gt;but when we talk about ""in general"" we're not talking about these areas, we're talking about the overall picture.

If there are areas where there are a lot of arab shops, the city in general got more arab. Thats how it works, generally. You sure can pick your parts of the city with &lt;5 of foreigners, but thats as little the general city as the one with &gt;40%.

&gt;The claim that the amount of arabic shops has exploded is simply false

No its simply not. Just because they exploded, so a lot of growth in a short time, doesnt mean that growth has to show in every single fucking street in the city. If one whole city district would be purely arab, it would be a huge growth, even though there are none in other districts. Just as an example.

2877,"&gt; Why the lower class for the longer blades?

Longer blades catch more wind, blades catching more wind get more force on them, more force equals greater structural loads. A wind turbine with a rotor diameter of 150 m will experience greater forces than a smaller turbine with a rotor diameter of 90 m at the same wind speeds.

&gt;I vaguely remember that the kW/km2 was about constant because you can either put a few big ones or a lot of small ones, but that was quite some time ago. You seem to say otherwise.

I'm not sure what you're really getting at. Bigger seems to be better for wind turbines since the swept area increases non-linearly with blade length. After all, A=r²π. A single 90 m rotor diameter wind turbine will have as much swept area as four 45 m rotor diameter wind turbines.

&gt;Although Hydrogen, and power to gas will have some level of leakage that may defeat the purpose, from a GHG point of view.

Hm, [just checked](http://ec.europa.eu/environment/integration/research/newsalert/pdf/39na1_en.pdf). It looks like hydrogen is an indirect greenhouse gas but its effect is but a tiny fraction compared to the fossil fuels it replaces.

&gt;France divided its CO2/kWh by 10 in 15 years in the 80s, while Denmark only managed to divide by 2-3 in the 90s thanks to wind. So far, its the big and fast record holder.

2885,"The problem with the name deal isn't the addition of North. It's many other things:

1. It eradicates our history - no, not talking about Alexander the Great. I'm talking about parts of our history that happened in Greece's region of Macedonia. Examples: our most famous revolutionary organization was founded there, it's the birthplace of famous revolutionaries like Goce Delcev or reformators like Misirkov (eho first officialized our language), and  many revolutions against Ottoman rule happened there. According to the name deal, all of that will most likely get deleted, or modified as to not even resemble fact anymore. Why? Because Greece feels threatened by the fact that our people live and used to live there, so anything stating that fact gets wiped. A clear demonstration of this are the constitutional changes being made at the moment. In them, the constitutional decisions made by ASNOM, a gathering which founded us as a separate country after WW2 are deleted, and instead replaced with a call to arms to fight the nazis in WW2.

2. Macedonian minorities get deleted - the deal defines our people as being exclusively linked to this land we presently have. Again because of Greek fears of our minority in Greece. So any indications towards it's existance are wiped out. Again, look at the constitutional changes we're making. In them, care for minorites, has been transformed into care for international expats and diaspora. Which isn't the same at all.

3. No name for national institutions - this is alright in the case of, let's say, the government or parliament, but not when the deal involves even cultural institutions such as the national theater, or folk groups, who now won't be able to call themselves ""macedonian"" now. They'll just be ""of North Macedonia"". Which is a de facto deletion of the very fact that we exist as an ethnicity. I would have preferred ""northmacedonian"" to no name at all.

4. Free speech censorship - anything going against this narrative can be fined or otherwise sanctioned. Even scientific work. For example a linguist studying the macedonian dialect in Greece's Macedonia, could be fined, jailed, or otherwise punished.

In old China,  that ""the rule of law and considering loyalty to the state above that of the family"" is similar, that is ascribed to minister Shang Yang of Qin.

2998,"&gt;Crusades were declared to save Byzantines from Turks

True, and then the Crusaders went on to almost immediatly betray the Empire in favour of their own interests. Bohemond outright refused to swear an oath to Alexios, and then later declared his own kingdom out of territory they were supposed to give to the Empire. 

The other Crusaders also followed suit following the Siege of Antioch, after some pretty shady scheming by Bohemond in which he falsely claimed that the Crusaders were trying to kill a Roman general (Tatikios).

So pretty much from the get-go the Crusaders would betray the Empire they were trying to defend

Sure they were supposed to defend the Empire originally, but it didn't really turn out that way at all. The Crusaders went their own way pretty quickly into the First Crusade.

The answer to historical questions like this are pretty complicated and multi-layered. If the answer was as simple as ""Turks were just better and crushed them like flies"", then there wouldn't be literal books written trying to discuss the reasons the Empire fell.

In rural areas it's often hugely impractical to drive to anything other than one particular superstore for a big shop, and you're utterly roped into social dependency on family and friends if you can't drive. The food supply chain in modern Europe is owned by companies, but if you showed shops and customers on a map, it's just a slightly fuzzier-bordered version of feudalism.

3067,"&gt; Russia went from the most backwards illiterate absolutist monarchist shithole in europe 

The most backwards illiterate absolutist monarchist shithole was a state that competed with most powerful countries of its time (UK &amp; France) in some spheres, in some spheres like literacy with more backward countries like Italy, and in some even with the third echelon like Spain or Portugal. Yeah, it definitely wasn't a heaven and had its minuses. In other words it was a normal regular European power plus-minus something.  


&gt; a global superpower capable of fighting off Germany in the three decades after the revolution. 

A global superpower was definitely a hell built to produce maximum of suffering. For example, it managed to win over Germany in 1940s. Germany was a country destroyed during the great war. Then some miracle happened and it became the roaring powerhouse of doom. Or something. Well, I am a sane man and don't believe in miracles, so my sight of view on it is simpler: Germany was a destroyed country that was inflated through a straw in the ass to play a whipping boy. And the USSR managed to beat this enemy destined to be beaten with maximal efforts and at the edge of catastrophe losing almost as much people as all participants of the war together. Because the USSR was itself an ass-inflated whipping boy. They do not typically talk about it because of their reasons: Americans are for example are used to see Russia as its enemy so they forgot about how they pumped the USSR in 1930s to prepare it to war with Germany. But no, no miracles happened.  


Miracles is the main entity in the inner cosmos of stalinists (or their trotskist brothers). It answers a lot of questions. For example, a degenerative robber became the leader of the largest country in the world. How it happened and why? Oh, the miracle happened, the degenerative robber suddenly revealed himself as a supergenius ideal Machiavellian ruler. Or it's known that by Stalin's orders scientists were killed, shot, frozen to death, sunk in shit sometimes. Then Russia became the scientific superpower that easily collected almost all achievements in the competition with the largest and most powerful country of its time. How exactly did it happen? Does it mean killing scientists help scientific progress? Oh, you see, the miracle happened. On the Kursk railroad station a bunch of supergenial scientists was found by the supergenius ideal Machiavellian ruler.  


As Ramzan Kadyrov says when asked to explain the budget of Chechen republic and how exactly this beggar region without economics manages to build skyscrapers and stadiums he smiles and says: ""Allah gives money"". Kadyrov and Stalin are both supergenius ideal Machiavellian rulers and both have their Allah Vladimirovich.

3082,"I completely disagree with your statement, and would argue that people refuse to join in movements/cults/groups all the time- that's how counterculture exists without all becoming the mainstream.

While consumerists have co-opted many subcultural names and aesthetics, movements like vegetarianism, veganism, socialism, femenism, punk, seapunk, fascism, conservativism, communism, anarchism, randianism, hell, even sports team affiliations or popular musicians all have associated behaviours (like going to games or gigs) and aesthetic choices, and other people quite often just... Reject them. For various reasons and in various ways, people do not just blindly mimic. We have biases and bigotries, a perspective and attitudes, moods and reasoning, so we certainly cannot say something so blanketing as your claim. 

We need major political change at every level if we're going to turn this sinking ship around, and that requires social movements and dismantling of the tools the wealthy use to entrench their ownership of the economy. The problem is that regular people have no power to make meaningful change just by making ecological decisions in their everyday lives- our daily lives are fundamentally anti-ecological because of the way the system has ended up.

3135,"&gt; Did you know that Karl Marx never intended communism for countries like Russia. He originally invented the communist ideology for and wrote the communist manifesto with nations like the UK and Germany in mind(ie advanced, developed, 1st world, civilised countries). And infact iirc he didnt think very highly of Russia or Russians, he saw them &amp; the country as backward, stupid, uncivilised, feudal peasants, not suitable for and or not the ideal place for communism. But the Russians had other ideas to Karl, and the rest as they is history.

This is a wild distortion of reality. First of all, Marx did not 'invent' communism, his theories simply tried to explain the contradictions within capitalism and how they would eventually lead to the end of capitalism and the beginning of the workers' rule. Socialist and communist movement, albeit in its infancy and somewhat different than Marxist movements, existed before Marx. 

Marx said that revolution would likely happen in the advanced capitalist societies of Western Europe, since the productive forces, as well as the working class would be advanced enough to carry out  a revolution. Yet this does not mean that he saw Russians as uncivilised. He praised some peasant communities of Russia for their communalism and saw them as an important example. He also couldn't have predicted the complete breakdown of the Russian Empire, which allowed the socialists to define the common sense at the time.","Turkey, Ankara",/r/europe/comments/9uxond/today_101_years_ago_the_bolsheviks_led_an_armed/e9871en/,Liathbeanna,1541601386

OK? What do they think the impact on a nuclear plant will be from a drone exactly? After 9/11 this stuff was looked at also and the conclusion is the risk are very low. It is not easy to 1) grab a Boeing 747 and 2) aim it directly at the reactor at such an angle it might do damage to it.

Umm...


&gt;Taking public transportation more often and changing to a more sustainable diet would do literally fuck all, even if every single person in the US did it.

Are you thinking consumption just means driving/eating..?

&gt;Trying to turn this into a person ""doing your part"" moral thing is the worst strategy as it's only going to alienate people and convince everyone it's hopeless. The only way we get out of this, if we do, is a massive technological breakthrough in clean energy and battery technology 

You certainly seem to be...

* Fast fashion

* new cel phone every year

* new bigger tv every couple years, 4k even if you watch nothing actually in4k

* automobiles considered old at 5 years and intentionally falling apart at 10 years

* every food you ate today was individually packaged

* it is more profitable to throw away anything lightly damaged than to discount it

* meat is no longer a luxury food but an expected staple of every meal

* using computing power to act as unnecessary middle-man in digital transaction

* cheap furniture built to ship efficiently, NOT to last decades

* as a business owner, almost any place where wastefulness and profitability meet, it's more profitable to be wasteful. Same for quality vs profitability. Better to spend $1 on a part that may fail in under a year than $3 on a part that will last several years... because that'd take the COG from $2 to $4 but may not even meaningfully increase the price we can charge

The idea that consumption is excessive and is the problem is ABSOLUTELY CORRECT. People ar consuming more than ever, and consuming more wasteful products than ever

What's wrong is the idea that curbing consumption means.... consuming less at the pump and the dinner table. The problem is systemic.

Hell, even the cargo ships... why do you think they're so massive, why do you think there are so many and they're constantly back and forth moving goods? Excessive consumption of low-quality disposable BS. And those cargo ships are actually a marvel of efficiency. They aren't wasteful at all... they're just enabling more wastefulness

&gt; convince everyone it's hopeless. The only way we get out of this, if we do, is a massive technological breakthrough in clean energy and battery technology

This is where much disagreement arises; I would say that in the immediate aftermath of just about any armed revolution, there cannot be anything *but* violence, because the new order is fragile. And the communist ideals required violence, too, because the upper class as a whole never gives up its privileges peacefully. Insofar as the violence was of the latter kind, I personally don't completely disavow it. Insofar as it was senseless, indiscriminate and avoidable, I do.


But I'm not ready to say that because of this innate necessity of violence, the idea of revolution per se is evil.

&gt;The ""faking"" of the A400M controls

&gt;Some in France call this a ""trick"". What exactly are we talking about? Orders when signing a cooperative contract. For example, for the A400M, Germany ordered 73 aircraft when the contract was signed in 2001, bearing in mind that the distribution of the workload between nations must take into account the number of orders placed. In this context, it obtains the main fuselage (Bremen) and military equipment (Ulm). As usual, Berlin overestimated its capacity requirement as it had already done for the Transall (from 110 to 60). In 2003, it reduced its order to 60 A400M, then to 53 in 2011.

Which had nothing to do with Germany ""overestimating"" the need for the machines. Italy and Portugal dropped out of the program entirely, which prompted Germany, the UK and Turkey to reduce the ordered numbers due to costs - South Africa dropped out entirely due to costs.

3276,"&gt; But since you know a bit more about it than I do, could they really get something from data like a text send in an app or a comment on the reddit application? 

That depends on the app or website. If the transmission isn't encrypted (like with https) absolutely, there are ready made tools available for it and we don't even need to go into the illegal areas for it. Wireshark, a great debug tool for network admins, captures all data it receives on an interface which includes cookies that often contain unencrypted login details (usernames and passwords). Thankfully more and more website and apps use encryption so it becomes less of a problem.

&gt; Accepting the terms is for liability, but do we really know if without it our data wouldn't be misused? With what proof are we going to come. 

Correct, it's just for liability. But it's useless either way as we just reduce the possible vectors of liability (if it's not copyright infringement, it might be somebody posted a slanderous message about somebody on a message board)

Then we might need to prove that somebody accepted the TOS at all which would require us to collect data and thus we might need to also include a statement about data collection.

And then comes the last issue, the legal letter we receive that might request we tell them who was responsible for the illegal act will most likely not contain the information we would require to identify the person. (Like what port was used, because all users share the same IP behind a NAT anyway) But even it contains that data, we would then need to log all connections made by everybody, which data protection laws prohibit.

So by logging nothing and providing the service without even a TOS (after all, just because there isn't a TOS doesn't give somebody the right to break laws anyway) we are keeping our liability to a minimum even though we know that we might have to defend against lawsuits that we would win because we are acting under immunity like ISPs do.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/9uy4m3/wifi4eu_free_wifi_for_europeans/e980l4u/,Alcobob,1541594447

Corporate Germany was both promoted and used by the state. Using resources of conquered people is the most capitalist thing you can do. 

I just got this from wikipedia (I know, I know, check out the sources yourself if you don't believe this): 

&gt; Nazi ideology held entrepreneurship in high regard, and “private property was considered a precondition to developing the creativity of members of the German race in the best interest of the people. [50] The Nazi leadership believed that “private property itself provided important incentives to achieve greater cost consciousness, efficiency gains, and technical progress.” [51] Adolf Hitler used Social Darwinist arguments to support this stance, cautioning against “bureaucratic managing of the economy” that would preserve the weak and “represent a burden to the higher ability, industry and value.” [52] 

Fascism and capitalism are on the same side of the political spectrum and share significant overlap. They do not contradict each other, in fact they go together pretty well. ",,/r/europe/comments/9uxond/today_101_years_ago_the_bolsheviks_led_an_armed/e980n70/,ThinningTheFog,1541594523

3353,"&gt; No its very much a real problem. The issue being is that they modeled the entire of europe and realised that you need a wind farm about 3x the size of europe to power europe because of how weather systems work.

That seems to be incorrect. https://www.businessinsider.com/how-many-wind-turbines-would-it-take-to-power-the-world-2016-10?international=true&amp;r=US&amp;IR=T

&gt;Which is exactly where you want the power....

A mere distance of less than a kilometer suffices to avoid that. You're not going to get many transmission losses on that distance. Besides, nuclear energy is worse in that regard: even a precautionary alarm for a minor release of radioactive material would cause the evacuation of the entire city or industry zone they were built next to - that's a lot more damage, not even a serious meltdown needed.

&gt;You mis understand. A wind turbine needs to be a minimum 400m downwind of the previous wind turbine or the turbulance upsets them because of the rotor wash.

The point was that the space in between can still just be used for normal surface activities like farming, transport or industry.

&gt;Do some basic maths and think about it. You can't use wind turbines to heat 10,000 tons of steel for example. Or drive a bus the length of a country. It simple does not meet the energy requirments to be used in many industry. So it is not capable of replacing around 80%+ of our actual energy use because it does not work!

Nuclear energy suffers from the same problem.

Besides, we can electrolyze water for our heavy heating duties. That will also conveniently take care of the excess energy during production peaks.

We don't need many of them, our *average* electrical demand is ~13GW and that (as 'nameplate') is about reached in 2023 with wind/solar, the 'peak' demand is probably ~20GW.    

To make a profit it needs to run ~90%-ish, with extra capacity to stagger the multi-plant *design* is already down to 75% (break even), meaning the retail ct/kWh has to go up to be profitable again, and Hinckley's wholesale 10ct/kWh CfD already looks lousy compared to the 5ct/kWh wholesale.     
*And if the weather gods are benevolent they can close the shop and go home.*    

I'll vote my 5ct/kWh difference for (too much) wind/solar + batteries, not in the least because I like competition to prevent the Australian monopoly AUD13000/MWh peaks during (artificial) shortages.

Essentially, what you are doing is more or less comparing Nazi Germany to relatively peaceful liberal economies and claiming that it's not going well because it's not a relatively peaceful liberal economy.

Us swedes and Scandinavians are extra salty cause we were always aligned with the brits in the EU, and now we’ve lost our biggest partner to actually uphold rights for countries not embracing the euro and are in the EU for the trade and the vast geopolitical power it wields. 

Personally I see the EU as more important for defence than NATO could ever be. The combined economic might rivals that of the US, and that actually makes us an actual equal counterpart to the US and China, and the superior in any other negotiation.

# Shell (projectile)

&amp;#x200B;

A **shell** is a payload-carrying [projectile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projectile) that, as opposed to [shot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round_shot), **contains an explosive or other filling**, though modern usage sometimes includes large solid projectiles properly termed **shot**.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(projectile)#cite_note-1)\[[*not verified in body*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)\] Solid shot may contain a pyrotechnic compound if a [tracer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracer_ammunition)  or spotting charge is used. **Originally, it was called a ""bombshell"",  but ""shell"" has come to be unambiguous in a military context.**

All explosive- and incendiary-filled projectiles, particularly for [mortars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortar_(weapon)), were originally called *grenades*,  derived from the pomegranate, so called because the many-seeded fruit  suggested the powder-filled, fragmenting bomb, or from the similarity of  shape. Words cognate with *grenade* are still used for an artillery or mortar projectile in some European languages.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(projectile)#cite_note-2)

**Shells are usually large-caliber projectiles fired by** [**artillery**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artillery)**,** [**combat vehicles**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combat_vehicle) **(including** [**tanks**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tank)**), and** [**warships**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warship)**.**

**Shells usually have the shape of a** [**cylinder**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylinder_(geometry)) **topped by an** [**ogive**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogive)**-shaped  nose for good aerodynamic performance, possibly with a tapering base  (boat-tail); but some specialized types are quite different.**",,/r/europe/comments/9um6qs/with_nuclear_instead_of_renewables_california/e97mave/,[deleted],1541569923

Iraq seems pacified at the moment. You are right about Afghanistan though the skirmish in Afghanistan is only stationing a few thousand troops.

This is a stretch. Compared to past wars the US has committed smaller numbers of troops. I read that US generals wanted twice the manpower for Vietnam for example but the politicians were reluctant.

&gt; failed to defeat the North-Vietnamese

Definitely. It is worth mentioning that it is hard to defeat an army if rules of engagement dictate you can't go up north and actually invade them and can only sit your army at the southern part of the country.

Really I just wish the proper research was put into fission, it's so side shelfed it's hard to make any really nifty stuff with it. 

Even modern nuclear power is only available because of the research into weaponization. If not for that we'd have a lot of people like you telling us any power production of any kind is never going to happen with nuclear. Took 40 years of dedicated effort before payoff and now it's the cheapest and cleanest energy we have but Chernobyl happened and scared the shit out of everyone. 

Not trying to call you out, those are still very real problems, but for the amount of cost to energy production for nuclear is still a lot better than essentially any other alternative, and even if there are some hurdles I'm sure we can still figure out a way to make it work, at least to the point it's more feasible than coal, solar, and wind.

3821,"&gt; You've insinuated several times that you do know the cost of the robots. So, tell me. Pass your knowledge on.

I cannot reasonably pass on the information that I have and I haven't researched publicly available information.  There is [this](https://prod.sandia.gov/techlib-noauth/access-control.cgi/1997/972405.pdf) source that goes into the many costs.  It's a bit old, but the costs haven't changed dramatically.

&gt; It's for space radiation which I realize is a much lower dosage than a power plant though. 

That's an understatement of the century.  Space radiation is so much lower, it's laughably not comparable.  For example, Apollo 14 experienced 1.14 rad and that's with going all the way to the moon and leaving the protective sphere of the Earth.  Designing for a nuclear plant means designing for 10-100 Mrad, which is 7 to 8 orders of magnitude more than Apollo 14.  It's laughably not comparable.

And even though space radiation is many orders of magnitude less, the numbers that you cite are already in the millions.  So imagine how much it would cost to deal with nuclear radiation.

&gt; What you're asking for seems like you're trying to trap me into a wrong answer.

I'm not trying to trap you into anything.  You made claims about being able to make robots cheaply.  If you're going to make claims, you need to be able to back them up.  Asking for the claims to be backed up isn't a trap but a reasonable expectation for the person making a claim.

3869,"&gt;But I think that joining the US in their strategy to isolate and contain Russia by levying sanctions is not only economically harmful but more importantly heightens tensions and risks creating a situation in EU-Russia relations where trade barriers and a general feeling of distrust and suspicion become the new normal. One can argue that this has already happened.

You are full of it. It has happened for a reason. Sanctions are a reaction to what they did.   
First of all, boohoo, all the damage economically that could have been done, has been done. At this point it wont get any worse for EU. At this point all the companies got used to to shitshow Russia-EU trade situation is.   
Second of all, why US strategy? We have our own. Sanctions are not some evil american imperialistic ploy. They are result of a dialogue between involved parties. 

&gt;We should never accept their territorial gains.

Hmm, maybe we should react to them then. Armed conflict would be reckless. I wish there was a way how to use soft power to pressure some country. Some kind of economic thing, like sanctions. 

&gt;Only Russia is to blame for their own actions.

They are, yes. We are rule based society. You brake rules, you get punished. 

&gt;And as for these hacking and campaign meddling allegations: China and the US do this to us, too. 

What about... what about this other person that broke rules as well oWo. - your logic  
We do not have enough muscles to mess with those two and they do not do it on such a massive invasive scale to warrant a reaction. You can tell by the way how our reaction to Russian actions is more severe than to the other twos. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, can we just acknowledge also how Russia does not even do a lot of shady stuff, but it is not even decent enough to do it properly? Like their spies get caught all the time, their emails get leaked, their assassins get captured. Say what you want, but US at least has the decency to train their people well.

3881,"It is absolutely a fair, and in fact **neccessary** (and standard) thing to do if you want to compare between countries, or get an accurate assessment of population density.

I mean, take the Marshall Islands for instance, 99% of that country's area consists of the water in between the islands. If you include that in the calculation, you arrive at a completely useless and artificially low figure for its density. 

In the case of the Marshall Islands, that would be a mere 4.49/km2. [This](https://static.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/first-google-result-image-capital-city-82-5938143953378__880.jpg) is what most of the Marshall Islands looks like. Do you really think that 4.49/km2 gives you an accurate impression of reality? 

If you properly account for this and only look at the landmass (which again, is pretty standard in statistics), you get 293km/2, which is the correct figure, and which is actually useful both to get a sense of how dense the country is as well as to compare it to other countries.

&gt; There are these things called 'hills'.

Because that isn't unclean and doesn't contribute to climate change.

It doesn't pollute the environment or changes the climate. It means fish who swim close to it are more likely to get cancer and eaten by bigger fish but the bigger fish would've eaten another fish and ionizing radiation does not propagate so it's completely safe to eat a fish that got cancer from nuclear waste; that's the difference with other toxins in the environment which accumilate.

The political climate was different back then than nowadays, political violence and disruptions at rallies gatherings or speeches was common. The SA was outnumbering the military 10 times, many in military weren't entirely in opposition to NSDAP either. The removal of ''unlimited freedom'' was essential for the NSDAP to have its core ideology be functional. The state comes before individual freedom. 

However when NSDAP just took power they didn't have much support, the brownshirts from SA were operating as a gang of socialist thugs taking and attacking property from those perceived against them. Rohm was pleading for a second revolution where he wanted to confiscate property from the elites and put men from SA in leading positions of society. SA gained a terrible reputation in society, due to this the night of long knifes got a lot of support from the population. The claim was made that Hitler did it to prevent ruin to Germany and the people went along with that due to how hated the SA had become. From there on out economic recovery happened and societal unrest faded.

3906,"Well *that* actually makes sense considering there's a **state** named Georgia, lol. It also doesn't help with the wacky placement of the Civil War being next to Rome in many books (which, again, makes sense contextually if you're going to teach about Roman political influence on the constitutions).

So then you hear a Ukrainian say they're from Ukraine. ""Where is that?"" ""Oh, it borders the country of *Georgia.*"" ""Haha, silly furrener hasn't figured out the difference yet."" So standard Yankee is still thinking in terms of city-states and nations by then when introduced to *Georgia*, the word.

I can think of no reason past Stalin for mentioning Georgia, and his being from Georgia is rarely brought up either... But if anything, with how the texts are set up, that would be even *more* confusing. ""Wait, the biggest com-yu-nest dicktater was *also* American?!?"" The state also shares many road &amp; place (red bridge, vale, gori/Gore, java) names with its ""older brother"" up until the civil rights movement. It's all pure chance, too, not immigration related. (Named for King George, the most shared names have vaguely similar sounds, or are like red bridge and Vale purely descriptive, Java was full of coffee plantations, Poti and Sarpi are *also* Injun words, etc.) Really, half of American geography fails are easily attributable to unimaginative British settlers.

3929,"Well, most arguments against abortion are actually not religious but scientific. Human life objectively starts at conception, the only question is if the child has value. Many atheists are also pro life for this reason.

I think if we consider that all human life has value, then that would include the unborn. They certainly can't think but they are persons who have a right to live. I don't think awareness makes anyone more or less a person. I think rape is a terrible thing but an abortion would not solve the pain, it just kills a baby. Some people are born out of horrible circumstances. I also think something like an ectopic pregnancy could be allowed an ""abortion"" (really it is just removing the fallopian tube where the child has implanted on to, to let the child die on her/his own). Most abortions are not done to save the life of the mother, but rather because she feels like she will be tied down or can't care for a child out of this time while adoption is available.

Poland has struggled enormously since WW2. In 1991 we (finally) gained independence from psychotic-communist Russia. In 1991 !!!! 

So it's not really 100 years ago if the problem is still current &amp; relevant.

Without German invasion, Poland's economy today would be similar to that of England, Holland, France &amp; Germany.

The reason why Polish people mass migrate to other countries is because WW2 fucked us up so bad we still haven't recovered financially.

If Germany was really fair play, and had peaceful intentions, they would have made sure that Poland is as economically strong as it could &amp; should be.

The issue of Germany invading Poland is very very current and affects millions of Poles to this day - in a negative way.

That's my opinion and no one has to agree with me but I do feel that if, as you claim, Germany is in it's peaceful phase, then they should be doing a lot more to fix the mess they created.

Consider the 40+ year old Polish people alive today, they had to grow up in a broken and isolated Poland, governed by communist mad men. So it's not really fair to brush it off as, it happened 100 years ago, when the aftermath deeply affected those alive today.

4067,"&gt; than constantly producing permanent waste than could fuel nuclear bombs

Are you suggesting that Thorium does not produce radioactive waste or bomb grade matrerial?   
The thing is, it does both.    
It is true that Th/233U produces less minor actinide (the waste that remain radioactive for millions of year), but still produce some, and fast Pu reactors can reduce them even more.   
As for bomb material, Th/233U is even worse than U/Pu, because, with U/Pu, your 239Pu that you want for the bomb is always contaminated with other Pu and you have to separate it and it is diffcult and costly; whereas, as I explained, for Th, you need to isolate 233Pa to have it decay to 233U, when doing so, you get pure 233U, perfect to make a [bomb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Teapot#MET). [Here](http://www.efn-uk.org/l-street/nuc-lib/thorium-reports/index_files/THrisks.pdf) is a good sumary of the proliferation risk from Thorium.

What usually happens is that if loanwords are present long enough in the vocabulary of a language, they eventually get respelled using the ""native"" alphabet of the language, or the letter/phoneme becomes naturalized and least a few new ""native"" words appear that use the letter. Lithuanian may be somewhat special in that respect.

I have looked up an analysis of Lithuanian letter frequency. It seems that ""f"" and ""h"" have been naturalized—they are used with a frequency comparable to ""z"" and ""ę"", which indicates they have become naturalized. I will update the map (remove ""f"" and ""h"" and leave only ""q w x"" there, which are not used natively and only appear in proper names).",Europe,/r/europe/comments/9umqbi/special_charactersdiacritics_used_in_european/e96a36j/,jakubmarian,1541529154

4116,"&gt; In February 2012, President Sarkozy decided to extend the life of existing nuclear reactors beyond 40 years, following the Court of Audit decision that this is the best option as new nuclear capacity or other forms of energy would be more costly and available too late. Within ten years 22 out of the 58 reactors will have been operating for over 40 years. The court expects EDF's projected investment programme in existing plant, including post Fukushima safety improvements, will add between 9.5% and 14.5% to generation costs, taking costs to between 37.9 and 54.2 EUR/MWh. Generation costs from the new Flamanville EPR reactor are estimated to be at least in the 70 to 90 EUR/MWh range, depending on construction outcome. Academics at Paris Dauphine University forecast that domestic electricity prices will rise by about 30% by 2020.

Before said battle, the Kievans burned Minsk (then called Mensk) to the ground. Nice founding date, isn't it?  
* Minsk only got Magdeburg rights in 1499, way later than other cities in the territory of modern Belarus (Brest was the first in 1390)  
* Like many other towns in Belarus, it was repeatedly sacked by invading foreign armies in 17th-18th centuries. Such is life in Eastern Europe.  
* Apparently, the first congress of a certain [Russian Social Democratic Labour Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Social_Democratic_Labour_Party) took place in Minsk. Back in the Soviet times, there was a museum dedicated specifically to that - I have no idea if it exists today.  
* Minsk was the capital of the self-proclaimed Belarusian National Republic, a failed attempt by nationalist intelligentsia to create a non-Communist Belarusian state in 1918. A noble idea it was, although completely unrealistic in the political conditions of that time.  
* Due to Minsk's close location to the Polish border in the interwar period, Soviet authorities wanted to move the capital of the Byelorussian SSR to Mogilev in the late 1930s. It didn't happen, but Mogilev stil got a supersized administration building originally intended for the republican government.  
* Minsk got trashed twice during WW2, first by massive Nazi air bombardment in 1941, then by Soviet artillery bombardment in 1944. There wasn't much left after the war.
* [The Minsk Ghetto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minsk_Ghetto).
* After WW2, the whole centre of the city was rebuilt in grand Stalinist style. [It looks very nice](https://i.imgur.com/MKIouLU.jpg), especially compared with the later Soviet-era districts.  
* Many rural residents were moved into Minsk in the 1960s and 70s to work in factories. Some say it was also done by the local government to artificially inflate the population and thus attract funds and approval for prestige projects like the Minsk Metro. As a result, Minsk has a lot of sprawling faceless commieblock districts. Some people from other cities like to complain about how residents of Minsk are all pretentious hicks.  
* Minsk will host [the 2019 European Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_European_Games), whatever the hell they are.  
* Local architecture fans like to complain about new ugly business centres and residential highrises spoiling the skyline. In my opinion, there should be more of these highrises, because Minsk is so ugly outside the Stalinist city centre, you can't make it worse anyway.  
* [Minsk has this epic thing!](https://i.imgur.com/9fVCo00.jpg) Reportedly it's on at least one list of the ugliest buildings in the world. Still looks better than most of the city. 
* Minsk is the only place in the country top foreign musicians go to, and the ticket prices are ridiculously expensive.

4259,"Let me share some former comm-bloc lore about what may define an informant, because situation might be similar now. In most of Warsaw Pact countries **every single person**  going abroad (read: west) was ""invited"" for a talk with intelligence employee. It was usually talk about citizen's obligations toward fatherland's safety, listening to warnings about foreign intell attempts to recruit and signing a paper that said many things but usually meant almost nothing (as most people aren't useful for intell). Signed paper = informant. Back home: answering questions regarding being recruited (or not, usually) by foreign agency and general talk about where have you been, what have you been doing etc. Since most people obviously didn't visit super-high-tech facilities, it was a formality. I think similar process is going on here.


Yes, purpose is obviously gathering intell. Or rather preliminary survey intended to find potential points of interes. Every person interviewed in such manner was considered an informant (numbers look good in reports!), regardless of aquired information or lack thereof.

No its very much a real problem. The issue being is that they modeled the entire of europe and realised that you need a wind farm about 3x the size of europe to power europe because of how weather systems work.

&gt; Which can easily be categorized as ""freak accident"" unless you place them in the middle of a residential area of course.

Which is exactly where you want the power....

&gt; It's not like they take up 400 m. They just have their socket, they're very space efficient.

You mis understand. A wind turbine needs to be a minimum 400m downwind of the previous wind turbine or the turbulance upsets them because of the rotor wash.

&gt; How does that even come close to answering ""why is wind power not green""?

Do some basic maths and think about it. You can't use wind turbines to heat 10,000 tons of steel for example. Or drive a bus the length of a country. It simple does not meet the energy requirments to be used in many industry. So it is not capable of replacing around 80%+ of our actual energy use because it does not work!

4286,"Nukes (especially PWRs) can do some load following (like a day/night cycle), and all must do Frequency Sensitive Mode.   
Also, remember that nuclear reactor are also used on ships and submarines and they certainly don't run at constant speed in straight lines for days on end.    
The limits on flexibility is actually on the claims put on the fuel clad. Interestingly, new fuel being developed with [accident tolerance](https://www.nei.org/news/2018/nuclear-industry-accident-tolerant-fuels) in mind add margins for more load following.  


Agreed, it's not the ""what about if there's no wind"" as much as ""what if there's wind everywhere on a sunny day"" that worries me.   

Am I true to read this as renewable taking the grid hostage: ""We are rocking the boat, deal with it"".   

Do you have example of renewables doing load following (other than ""too much wind, let's shut for the day"" and blade angle/rotor speed adjustment?   

Funny how you suggest diverting overproduction to Hydrogen production only for renewable, why couldn't you do it with ""anything extra"" from the nukes too?    
Or storing heat in [molten salt](http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2015/ph240/dodaro2/docs/6339782.pdf).   

The true test will be how do you survive a cold January without sun nor wind? Do you not use your car because you need the power in the battery for your heating?   
The 'distributed' storage implies also interesting relationship: if your car now offer storage to the grid, does that mean that you could have a morning a message ""sorry, you can't start your car because we are expecting a lot of wind and will need the capacity"", or ""sorry, your battery didn't charged because we needed the power for something else""? If not, how can the producers be sure to have storage available?   

I'm also sure that neighbouring countries are happy to buy excess power on the cheap; until they themselves will have power to get rid of (which is what we are heading towards).

&gt;“Nordic countries tend to do more of their child care in the marketplace because child care is a government job. As Sherwin Rosen (1997, 82) described Sweden, “a large fraction of women work in the public sector to take care of the children of other women who work in the public sector to care for the parents of the women who are looking after their children. If Swedish women take care of each other’s parents in exchange for taking care of each other’s children, how much additional real output comes of it?””

First of all, child care is not a government job in Sweden - it’s subsidised though. How can anyone blatantly avoid seeing any value added with women in the work force? To make the argument that one teacher per child is more effective is just ludicrous. The whole point is to have less caregivers per caretakers and freeing up resources and opportunities. 

Looking at the fact that the average American spends 8700 USD on healthcare per year, and the average swede spends 4900 USD with the result of having a substantially higher life expectancy and still not finding any virtues in a single payer system is mind boggling.

4333,"You are referring to the [INES scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Nuclear_Event_Scale), and yes, if you add the entire 50 years, you'll certainly get many incidents.   

This has indeed lead to upgrade of existing plants, and additional design provision in new ones. To a cost.    
However, when considering that even the ""cheap+crappy"" can run for 40-[60](https://www.reuters.com/article/finland-power-nuclear/finnish-reactors-meet-preconditions-for-life-extension-energy-chief-idUSL5N1T84SA) or even [80years](https://www.nei.org/news/2018/turkey-point-second-license-renewal-application), even those costs are not that much when you can churn out TWh at a capacity factor above 90%.     
Additionally, not every country and not every time is [comparable](https://thebreakthrough.org/images/nuclear_construction_graphic_1.jpeg). One thing that you will find in common for cheap project across countries and era is the strong political will and support.    
The thing that cost much more today than yesterday is ... money.   
Consider this: no Total refinery got closed after the BP Horizon fire; no Exon oil rig project get cancelled after a Japanese tanker oil spill.     
But a tsunami in Japan killed German power plants, and Three Miles Island killed nuclear power in the West for decades. And that's without talking about local and national oppositions to projects.   
When you are banker about to lend billions, that is a big risk. You may be willing to take the risk, but only if there is a big reward at the end. For Hinkley, the reward starts at [20%](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/energy/10704516/EDFs-Hinkley-Point-returns-substantially-higher-than-other-projects.html).   

So, considering this, is it a surprise that strong, centralised governments (France of the 70s, or todays Russia and China) could/can deliver cheap and fast nuclear power plant?   
France definitely lost a good chink of its knowhow by stop building plants for two generations of engineers, they are re-learning, and not with the simplest design.   
China and Russia never stopped.   

We are soon about to learn the subtle nuance between cost and price.   
Cost is what the producer has to pay to get 1kWh to the grid. Price is what the consumer has to pay to get 1kWh out of the grid, preferably when and where he needs it.   
Sure, wind and solar cost is tumbling down; would that equate to price tumbling down too? Look at electricity prices in Europe, does Germany and Denmark fare that well?    


Sure, solar and wind are intermittent, and nukes don't like that. You know who does? Fossil plants. They can follow much easily, plus their cost is fuel driven not capital driven (a nuclear power plant cost roughly the same no matter how much you produce, while gas/coal dont cost much if they dont produce). That's why Big Gas loves renewable, they add instability to the grid, that only they can manage. You get your big headlines in the media about all those wind turbine, you get your 30-40% renewable, and they know they'll be the one to fill the rest.    
Denmark is the case study of this.   

Note that your graph warns about overgeneration risk. Already now, negative prices are happening in Europe with only few 10% of renewable. Imagine when everybody overproduce at the same time and push to send power away to protect their grid.    
Whether the grid reinforcement, or the grid scale battery storage (build but used only few hours per year) are included into the ~€30/MWh or not, they will be included into the price.

I was not talking about price of power originally. It is inconsequential when it comes to climate change and usability. We need a carbon-free power source, and price is but a part of it. A very small part, honestly. Nobody here seems to be claiming nuclear is bad because it's expensive; so let's not pretend this is the issue here. It is you who is hung up on the price narrative, forcing it on everything... so yeah. Your ass. Which seems to be doing the thinking.

A ""basic fact"" sponsored by the pro-Nuclear lobby. I heard smoking tobacco is also a great way to deal with anxiety and improve digestion, maybe we should all start smoking?

What do you reckon is gonna happen once we massively expand nuclear usage? You do realize these outputs ain't static and with every additional reactor, the probability for an accident rises?

Because in reality accidents still happen, there is no such thing as ""perfect"". All this BS talk about ""super perfect new designs that could never pollute anything"" is just that: Cheap PR talk.

Even in countries that haven't been shy about nuclear at all, like France, most of the reactor fleet running is outdated and they gonna have extreme problems decommissioning them as French energy companies [didn't put enough money aside for that](https://www.powerengineeringint.com/articles/2016/04/france-underestimating-costs-of-nuclear-decommissioning.html).

That's actually the big problem in nuclear energy today.

Consider that ionizing radiation is well understood and there are plenty of ways to deal with it. That safety precautions have had decades to develop and that the technology itself has improved. For the next 50-100 years we can rely on nuclear power while at the same time steadily building up our wind and solar energy infrastructure. After that we can stop using nuclear.

It depends on whether the infrastructure lends itself to having a large number of actors or not. It's great for fiber optic Internet for example, because you can squeeze so much bandwidth into the cables and it can be routed so many different ways once it leaves the local loop. I've got 20 different ISP's to choose from, prioritizing different things like low cost, or high performance, or personal integrity etc.   

Long-distance bus routes can also easily be privatized, because there's room for many buses, even if some drive the same routes and compete for the same passengers. City bus routes on the other hand, can't really be privatized, because there's not enough room on the inner city roads for several different bus companies driving the same routes, competing for passengers. The municipality can of course hire several different bus companies, but the outwards facing infrastructure like tickets and fares needs to be unified in order to utilize the limited road capacity efficiently. The same is true for trains. With such limited capacity, it's horribly inefficient if some passengers can't use certain trains because they don't have the right ticket.

I wasn't comparing nuclear to renewables. I'm arguing that, with current technology, 100% renewable is impossible, mainly due to the fact that we can't control renewables and our technology to store energy is very limited.

&gt;Are you against protests in general? 

No, only those held on the same day with the purpose to himder or confront another, whoever is doing that.

Everybody can protest or show support for something but opposing groups looking for a confrontation or silencing of another group is dangerous and/or democratic. I am a democrat first and foremost.

&gt;Or are you just supporting and whitewashing the far right? No, it doesn't have any purpose at all. All it does is preach and commit violence; in the 90s they were beating up and killing foreigners, now they pretend to be politicians. 

Didnt happen in this area. In fact the only recent political murder was that our a right Dutch PM elect by a far left radical and our last domestic terror group was communist in origin (CCC)

No violence recorded here from the right that compares.

&gt; Do you know who really mentioned the ""risk"" you mention? The CSU and the Freie Wähler. Surprisingly I don't see any support from you lot for these parties.  Even worse: you pretend the brown politicians are just ""conservative"". This is of course far from the truth. Marching against that lie has nothing to do with intolerance.

Again, different country and different history. I mention conservatives because our national conservative party faces the same ""tolerance to intolerance"" line despite disavowing the far right themselves, which made it lose all value really. Especially after unions showed their disrespect for the democratic process by many strikes against our first gov in 25y without socialists.

I guess I support a Belgian CSU version though, not Trump or AfD or VB. But hey, you have already made a wrong judgement call with partial knowledge, what else is new? Lumping me in with the far right because I critiqued the left, nice.

4526,"&gt; Just starting with making a wind turbine requires quite a lot of energy. In fact it consumes approx 1000 tons of coal. Which is the same as around 1 years output of the wind turbine. Wind turbines normally are built for 25 years. So that isn't such a big deal... Just take off 4-5% already.

That goes for any form of infrastructure, including nuclear and the large amounts of materials that have to be processed into the exotic metals for the plants, and the fuel of course. All with fossil-fueled machinery, and energy-intensive processing.

&gt;But.. Most wind turbines don't put out anything close to what they are actually rated for. They always give maximums to ""sell it better"".

Only a moron would ignore the fact that you need wind to make the turbine turn.

&gt;Wind turbines also have a problem where they don't produce the power reliably it basically produces more / less power. [...]
&gt;They also have problem when there is no wind. They don't produce any power obviously. So you have to build the rest of the infrastructure to deal with this anyway and power stations coal, gas, nuclear don't ramp up / down quickly so you have to keep them mostly on no matter how much wind power your getting.

That's a problem that can be mitigated with larger networks, demand management, and various forms of storage. For now we can steadily build up the renewable capacity because we'll still have flexible gas plants no matter what. We would also have to use those to supplement the non-flexible nuclear.

&gt;Unless we have a way of storing this energy and get it back but even with that you need to build 2-3x (closer to 5x) the number of turbines than there is demand.

That's a non-problem.

&gt; Its also produced in areas where is not used and typically suffers from large transmission losses.

Same goes for nuclear plants. By definition they produce everthing concentrated in one area. At least wind energy is distributed over the country, reducing transmission losses.

&gt;They also have to turn them off when there is too much wind.

That is not harmful in any way.

&gt;They have been known to kill people because of the icing problem. Wind turbines are capable of throwing ice 50-100 meters or so from the blades.

Which can easily be categorized as ""freak accident"" unless you place them in the middle of a residential area of course.

&gt;They also use a massive amount of space. They need built a minimum of 400 meters apart.

It's not like they take up 400 m. They just have their socket, they're very space efficient. They can easily be placed along highways or industrial zones, without having to dedicate extra space.

&gt;No all places are suitable locations.

Well duh. The same goes for every energy facility.

&gt;So once you figure out that out of a wind turbines life cycle you only get about 30-50% of whats its rated output is because of the above reasons. 

Again, only a moron would forget to account for the wind on the spot where they place the turbine.

&gt;Then you suddenly look at the bigger picture and notice that electricity generation is only about 30% of the problem in the first place mostly because people think that electricity is industry because of what they see and use everyday. They forget about planes, cars, trucks, ships and the rest of industry that doesn't use any electric for its serious power consumption eg steel production, oil refineries. So often when people say. Wind produced 20% of all power this weekend. What they actually mean is it produced 20% of 20% of what is actually used which is closer to 5%.
Currently in the world renewable energy by wind + solar is 2% of demand. Hydro beats is really easy with 7%.

How does that even come close to answering ""why is wind power not green""?

4529,"I'm not missing the point.

The article is written by a pro-nuclear lobby group claiming nuclear is clean. It really isn't if you expand the boundaries beyond immediate operation. Our solution to deal with the waste is to bury it.

What's being suggested is that we ramp up nuclear capacity - this is a huge, long-term investment and commitment to a technology that we don't currently have a solution to the waste for. Nuclear power plants take a long time to plan, design, construct and commission whilst being very capitally intense. As far as I know there are currently no operation Gen IV designs, if the plan is to use these extend that timescale even further.

Alternatively, we could continue to invest in renewables, continue to reduce coal usage (the UK will have no coal at all in the coming years, expect a similar trend across to continue across Europe) and limit the use of other fossil fuels (natural gas and oil). We can continue to invest in carbon capture and storage/utilisation. We do have technologies for carbon capture -they're just expensive. The solution is similar - bury it. The difference is a leak of CO2 is less likely to be a problem than a leak of radioactive material.

We can continue along the Energy 2050 plan to reduce emissions

I'm not saying nuclear doesn't have a place in the future, but to pretend it's unquestionably the way to go is facile - hence the policy decisions made by DG Clima, DG Grow and the rest of the European Commission.

This shows the priorities of the Polish people. Nationalism is important to them. Even a few thousand Middle Eastern refugees cannot be helped by the Polish people.

4776,"&gt; Are they also not likely to investigate/prosecute people who are in the current government or connected with the government?

You have misunderstood me. Judges sided with former government/current opposition. This side is treated very lightly, police and prosecutors do their job (for example against people who disrupt peaceful demonstrations) and then judges acquit these people. Looks like prosecutors are mostly fine as I see the same faces over and over again and no negative comments from anybody so I assume that there is consensus from both sides that they are ok. Regarding police, as I said corruption has declined considerably.

&gt; do you think the main rotten part are only the judges?

It is not even that. Judges in general are ok, it gets bad when they are involved in high profile stuff. They are very politically active and they shouldn't + tribal mentality. They defend each other regardless of facts. Disciplinary chamber is farce. Few judges drive drunk or steal but they are almost always defended by peers so that opinion is associated with whole community. They are arrogant, call themselves ""special caste"" while performing actions which do not accord with the seriousness of the office, in the same time.

Why wouldn't it be relevant? It's much more relevant than specific ages. The most obvious effect is that it means the ""experimenting with alcohol"" phase happens when there is zero danger of drunk driving. And I would say driving in that phase is the most dangerous part of it.

From my experience, Americans learn drinking responsibly relatively late, and even in their 20s quite a few of them see ""getting drunk"" as something exciting. They also take being able to drive much more for granted, since they start doing it so early.

&gt; The point was that we knew for a fact that raising the drinking age would save lives

4785,"Wow, that article sure likes to ignore the small issue that it's only cheap because the plants are old and France only has enough to barely supply it's own population during most winters.

But not all winters! [https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-france-election-power-analysis/france-likely-a-frequent-power-importer-in-years-to-come-idUKKBN16K1CX](https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-france-election-power-analysis/france-likely-a-frequent-power-importer-in-years-to-come-idUKKBN16K1CX)

It physically did not have enough reserve production capacity left to supply it's own demand if it weren't for imports! Which were produced with our favorite type of fuel here in Germany, lignite.

So sorry, but no. To claim that something is good just because it's cheap is quite frankly insane when it can't do it's job (to supply enough energy) in the first place.

So simply build more nuclear plants? Well then you increase the average price of electricity with it, as a nuclear power plant running at 50% capacity will double the price of the energy created. (Since the largest costs is not in fuel, but in the construction and decommissioning).

And what does a modern nuclear power plant cost? Well Hinkley Point C will cost more than 20 billion and produced energy for more that 0,1 € per kWh.

And just to be sure, i'm not against nuclear energy on principle. We should here in Germany kept out plants running longer. But constructing new ones is just from a business perspective a gamble on if there's any profit to be made.

But again the primary goal of your energy generation facilities is to supply your population even during peak demand, and in this way the french energy mix of most nuclear power plants fails. And worse yet, because it can supply energy so cheap, installing spare capacity via gas turbines (or whatever) that only run during peak demand is an economic no go.

Let's say that you have two countries: Individuland and Sociland.  In Individuland, there are no pensions or social security.  Workers put money into a retirement account every year and when they retire, they spend the money in the account.  In Sociland, the government takes a portion of workers' income and guarantees workers that they'll have income in their retirement.  In Sociland, someone just about to retire might have nearly zero savings and still be in a reasonable position.  After all, when they stop getting paid by their employer, the government will be paying them.  They don't need wealth.  By contrast, someone in Individuland might have $500,000 in savings which makes them seem wealthy on paper, but that money is really just the income they're going to have in retirement.  In a simplistic zero-interest/gains scenario, that $500,000 would offer $25,000 per year for 20 years.

Is the person in Individuland really wealthier than the person in Sociland?  I'd argue they're not, assuming that the Sociland pension will give them an equivalent income in retirement.  However, they do have more wealth on paper.

I don't know enough about the retirement systems of various countries, but wealth will really vary based on what government does.  If the government takes 2% of your income to put into unemployment, that's not wealth for when you don't have a job.  If the government provides no unemployment benefit and you put away 4% of your salary into a bank account in case you lose your job, that is wealth.  However, if you lose your job, the 4% of your income that you put away might not cover expenses as well as the 2% the government has put away from everyone to spread the risk over more people.  So, is the second person really wealthier?  Frankly, it will depend on one's judgement of the risk of being jobless, one's politics, etc.",,/r/europe/comments/9ujt07/household_net_financial_wealthexcluding_real/e955nuh/,commentsOnPizza,1541480148

If I take the whole continent as a closed system, tell me how decentralization and microgrids make it more efficient. Transmission lines have losses, but how do you achieve substantially shorter length in total? So the losses are smaller and also voltage &amp; conductors' cross area can be tweaked to hit the even a better sweet spot, provided you aren't changing the height of transmission pylons.

This isn't what happened at Yalta. Yalta was a conference (not a treaty), negotiated between Roosevelt, Stalin, and Churchill. Roosevelt actually did not distrust Stalin. Under Yalta, Stalin agreed to have democratic elections in all of these countries and Roosevelt literally believed that Stalin was telling the truth. Roosevelt then died in April of 1945 right before the war ended. 

&amp;#x200B;

The US and the USSR were both allies at the time and nobody in the Roosevelt government was thinking that the Soviet were trying to take over all of Europe. The only thing anyone was thinking about at Yalta was defeating Germany (and Japan for the US). The Cold War hadn't started yet.

The US also pays for pensions. The average government pension from the mandatory social security system is $1,400/month in the US, which is basically the exact same as the average €1,263.15/month payment in Germany. But almost everyone people also save and invest money on top of that.

Oh definitely. One of the biggest disadvantages of a big government is the inefficiency and the wide political connections, a lot of them self serving. You will see something similar when your government grows some day if progressives get into power a few consecutive terms. (which is not an endorsement of Trump, I have to be careful nowadays lol)

But yea, it is what it is and it makes these savings seem like a far fetched, impossible dream. Getting by and saving some money to one day be able to afford a home loan deposit rather than investing in stocks is the way to go unfortunately: it's much harder for a young well educated (Ma) European today than it was for a young American teacher in the 60 or 70s to save that way.

4969,"There was a time period when tax rates kept on going up an up in the US throughout the 20th century up to like 70% in the 1950s. Then Republicans started just saying ""no more"" and made an all out war on taxation (which cause the Republicans to win lots of middle class votes when they cut taxes). The the Democrats adopted that same low-tax attitude for middle class taxes and only wanted to raise tax on rich people. (When they say 1%, they mean they literally just want to raise taxes on the top 1%)

&amp;#x200B;

It's easy to tax rich people in the US because the US imposes taxes on worldwide income. Rich people in the US cannot just move 100km away to escape US taxation. The only way to escape US taxes is to actually renounce your American citizenship and move abroad. If I move to France, I'd still have to file a US tax return. But then again, it wouldn't make any sense for rich people in the US to move to France just to pay higher tax rates in France. If I moved to France, I'd still have to pay capital gains tax on all my stocks and assets in the US, and rich people in the US aren't allowed to move their US assets abroad without paying gains taxes. 

&amp;#x200B;

Right now, prospects for most people are increasing in the US because the economy is doing really well and the unemployment rate is really low, which is driving wage increases. I think we'd be fine if we just raised tax rates on the top 1-5% of earners because that would encourage companies to pay even more money to lower and medium workers and raising capital gain rates since there'd be less after-tax incentive to pay out to the higher earners.

What about ferries? some are private like P&amp;O ferries and ferries at busy crossings, others are taxpayer subsidized for more remote areas. Waterways are not the same as railways, it is similar to having a private train line run from London to Manchester but a tax payer subsidized train from tadcaster to Wakefield.

Broadband is very easy to switch between and I am generally not locked into one because I live in a certain area. So apples to oranges.

By Xander Snyder

When outgoing Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Kotzias announced last month that Greece intended to expand its territorial waters from six nautical miles off the coast to 12 nautical miles, it reignited a dispute that had been simmering for decades. It may seem like a minor change at first glance, but Greece has thousands of islands scattered throughout the Aegean and Ionian seas, so expanding its territorial limits will have outsize effects on the region. According to Kotzias, the first planned extension will be to Greek territory in and along the Ionian Sea – from the island of Othonoi to the island of Antikythera. Then, Greece plans to expand the extension to its east coast, from Antikythera to the Saronic Gulf and then through the Pagasitikos Gulf in the Aegean Sea. This is where it has run into opposition, namely from Turkey, which has major ports along the Aegean and depends on free passage through this sea to access the Mediterranean.

Grounds for War

Turkey has long been at odds with Greece over control of the Aegean, and predictably responded with stern warnings. It summoned Greece’s ambassador to Ankara and released a statement reminding Athens of a 1995 declaration by the Turkish parliament that Greek expansion of territorial boundaries beyond six nautical miles would be considered “casus belli,” or grounds for war. In response, Greece has decided to refer the matter to parliament, instead of passing the change through presidential decree as originally intended.

Greece has argued that it has a right under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea to extend its maritime borders to 12 nautical miles, the maximum allowed by the treaty. (Turkey is one of few countries, along with the U.S., that hasn’t ratified UNCLOS, which has more than 160 signatories.) Since 1936, however, Greece has claimed sovereignty over only six nautical miles from its shores. (Prior to this time, it had control over only three nautical miles.) Turkey wants to keep it that way, claiming that the Aegean is a special case given the proximity of Greek islands to the Turkish coast. According to the Turks, UNCLOS shouldn’t apply there and the issue must be settled through bilateral talks.

Turkey has effectively drawn a red line in the Aegean Sea, and it’s not hard to understand why. If Greece were to extend its territorial control to 12 nautical miles, it would create a potential chokepoint in Turkey’s access to the Mediterranean, forcing Turkish vessels departing from, say, the Bosporus (arguably Turkey’s most valuable strategic asset) or even Izmir (a major port on the Aegean) to navigate through Greek-controlled waters. The extension would increase Greek jurisdiction over the surface area of the Aegean from 43 percent to 71 percent, and reduce international waters from 49 percent to 19.7 percent. It would also increase Turkish claims over the sea, from 7.5 percent to 8.8 percent, but navigation through these waters could still be hampered for the Turks by its historical adversary, an unacceptable proposition for Ankara.

While UNCLOS does allow for “innocent passage” through sovereign territorial waters, there are restrictions. For example, states are prohibited from carrying out military exercises that involve any sort of weapons, and submarines that travel through the waters must remain above the surface. There are also restrictions on loading or unloading any commodities in violation of the laws and regulations of the coastal state and conducting research or survey activities, which Turkey needs to do if it’s to secure access to natural gas supplies in the Eastern Mediterranean.

Enforcement measures for UNCLOS are notoriously weak, but the European Union has backed Greece’s right to extend its territorial control. It’s undoubtedly a worrying development for Turkey, which has increasingly squared off against European countries over drilling rights in the Eastern Mediterranean. And if Greece does extend its territorial boundaries, Turkey may not be able to carry out military exercises in these waters to intimidate other countries competing for natural resources there or block European vessels from accessing drilling rigs, at least not without violating UNCLOS, which could draw an EU response.

Extending the maritime boundary by six nautical miles won’t really change much in the balance of power between Greece and Turkey. The balance of power between two states is defined not by what either side says it controls but by the military hardware and forces it has to back up its claims. Still, it’s a good litmus test for Greek power. If Greece can extend control by six nautical miles without a Turkish challenge, it would demonstrate that Greece is more powerful than it previously was and than many believed it to be. Conversely, if Turkey can push back, it’ll be a sign of the limits of Greek power.

Cyprus Heats Up

Why is Greece making this move now? One possible reason is that it’s looking for ways to push back against Turkey’s recent moves around Cyprus and to test how far Turkey is willing to go there.

The long-standing dispute between Greece and Turkey over Cyprus – an island split between a majority Greek Cypriot population in the south and a minority Turkish Cypriot population in the north – has remained relatively calm for decades but has intensified this year. In February, Turkey blocked an Italian ship contracted by energy firm Eni en route to explore for natural gas in Cyprus’ exclusive economic zone, claiming that Cyprus had given access to a portion of its EEZ that actually belonged to the breakaway Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, a state recognized only by Ankara. In October, the Turkish navy blocked a Greek frigate that Turkey claimed was trying to obstruct a Turkish energy exploration ship operating in the region. And on Wednesday, Turkey announced its own deep-sea drilling vessel, the Fatih, had begun drilling off Turkey’s southern coast, near Cyprus.

For Turkey, having access to natural gas reserves off Cyprus is about more than money. Turkey is highly dependent on imported natural gas to meet its growing energy needs. Natural gas accounts for roughly 27 percent of Turkey’s energy consumption, and about 99 percent of its supply is imported. In 2017, its natural gas consumption reached a record high – 53.5 billion cubic meters – and over 50 percent of this supply came from Russia. Its second-largest supplier, Iran, supplied 17 percent. So long as Turkey remains dependent on these countries for natural gas, its strategic flexibility will be limited.

For Greece, Turkey’s assertiveness in the Eastern Mediterranean is concerning because it demonstrates a willingness to use force in pursuit of economic interests. To that end, Turkey may be willing to establish a greater military presence closer to Greek shores. In any case, Athens has been suspicious of Turkey’s intentions for many years. Greece’s move this week to end its diplomatic spat with Russia over Moscow’s alleged undermining of the deal on the Macedonia name dispute may be a hint that Greece wants more allies in its corner should any conflict with Turkey erupt.

Although it’s unlikely that Turkey would want direct confrontation with Greece, given that it’s already engaged in northern Syria, it can’t be ruled out completely. After all, Turkey invaded Cyprus in 1974 following a Greek-backed military coup on the island, even though both countries were already NATO members at the time. They almost went to war again in 1987 and 1996 over similar issues.

That the Greek prime minister is turning the decision on maritime borders in the Ionian Sea over to parliament indicates he’s not willing to press the issue, at least not for now. (Though he may also be looking for parliamentary approval so he can avoid blame if the move ignites a conflict with Turkey.) The real test would come if the Greek parliament decided to move ahead. At that point, the Greek government would be faced with a tough decision: back down or risk possible confrontation with a NATO ally, however unlikely. If it chooses the latter, the Turks would then have to decide how to respond. If a conflict were to break out, there would be consequences beyond Greece and Turkey. A war between two NATO allies could substantially weaken the alliance or even lead to Turkey’s expulsion. When they confronted each other in 1974, the Soviet Union was still a considerable threat, and Turkey was a key part of the containment line, which limited how widely the conflict could spread. Today, Russia poses nowhere near the danger the Soviets once did, and thus the alliance isn’t as secure as it once was. Still, so long as Turkey is unable to independently defend itself from Russia, it needs NATO as a shield, and it’s therefore unlikely to challenge a NATO ally and risk incurring the consequences.",,/r/europe/comments/9uiijf/greece_and_turkey_hit_rough_waters_in_the_aegean/e94hvi3/,SkinnyNerd,1541458120

No. The basic problem still remains: There are lines that just are unprofitable to run, but these lines are important, because they feed the major, profitable lines.

It doesn't matter if the state owns the network if the company that uses the network is private and decides to shut down the lines that aren't turning in a profit.

Privatizing the railway system makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. Its a public service, it shouldn't be in private hands, because its just not meant to be profitable.

5262,"&gt; What do you think happens when dam breaks? And they ruin the area for us, not for everyone. Nature is doing OK near Chernobyl for example.

Plenty of dams have broken and caused catastrophic damage to human settlements but the effect can be reversed within years. Most dam breaks are not overly violent affairs  anyway (as the risk is known beforehand).

&gt; Just like switching to solar 100% is also not achievable. And that is the problem, there is a lack of will for nuclear since people have been scared by nonsense. That is why we should change that and start building.

This is beyond the scope of the argument I was responding to. There exists a significant risk that more unstable countries would have plant failures, not to mention other security considerations.

&gt; Your idea is than basically: whatever, let's continue to use coal. Meanwhile, that is ruining our planet and killing millions of people, while nuclear does neither. If we can get 50% of the world on nuclear in 50 years, that is at least a start! Make the other 50% solar, wind, hydro. But we need to get off coal asap.

Gas is already displacing coal due to cost, availability and other market pressures. To get rid of coal, you don't have to do anything.

For CO2, I'm willing to make the bet that we'll have better choices within these next 50 years.

We don't negotiate collectively for surgical procedures or drugs here in the states which is the biggest problem.  An MRI costs thousands of dollars in the states but in Japan a doctors association has determined that price to be around 90 dollars and that's what the government pays for it. What's worse is we actually have tons of government spending in healthcare in both social programs and because health insurance through companies is super subsidized ( about 60% of the cost is written off their taxes) so we spend more public money on healthcare in the us than countries with socialized health care in top of the private costs. ,,/r/europe/comments/9u79ad/how_i_see_healthcare_in_the_us_after_living_in/e948uyv/,misanthropik1,1541450853

As someone who's done some compliance-related de-identification and data analysis (and knows a little tech), that sentence scares the hell out of me.

Identifying someone indirectly is pretty easy, if you can combine enough datasets together.

If a site logs an IP address and a timestamp, along with ANY other piece of information, and that dataset is sold to a third party collecting such datasets from multiple sites, it's computationally intensive but entirely possible to build a full online profile of someone. (IP addresses used on multiple sites within a similar timeframe - and then aggregate any data associated with that combination on each site. It'll be a little messy, but doable.)

But since IP addresses are mutable, the original sites do not necessarily have a way of knowing what 'data subject' is requesting deletion, without getting the full dataset from the third party aggregator. (even that dataset is a 'best guess'.)

So let's say I visit 4chan at 8AM, and leave a comment with my IP address and timestamp (both of those are publicly visible on 4chan), and I visit reddit at 8:01AM, and it logs my username and IP address and a timestamp, and someone scrapes 4chan and buys my data from reddit, putting together the fact that these are associated (probably) with the same person, then I request 4chan deletes all my posts, since many of them contain 'the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity' of me as a 'natural person'.

4chan can't do that reliably, since all it has is IP addresses and timestamps, and my IP address has changed countless times over the years I've been there. But the information it has is still, under the language of this law, 'personal data'.

Better yet, let's say I also hit pornhub at 8:02AM, under the same IP address, and have to give an age to verify I'm old enough to wank. All pornhub has is my IP address, a timestamp, and an age. And they sell it to the same aggregator. Then I ask pornhub to delete all my 'personal data'.

They don't have the information to do that, unless they get access to the aggregator's dataset/analysis which is a guess at what IP addresses are associated with me as a natural person during which timeframes.

What if I sometimes use a VPN? It's still my comments and the my age, but 4chan and pornhub don't have the records to determine it's really mine, even if it can be used to indirectly identify me.",,/r/europe/comments/9ubzzu/the_worldwide_web_everybody/e93gsoa/,SomeOtherTroper,1541428378

5575,"I agree with you on the fact that throwing money down the drain to governments that wouldn't sensibly improve their economy is completely stupid: I'm not a fan at all of the current Italian government project in spending more just to appease its electorate base (such as spend more to offer a better pension to people that are already living better than the ones working). That's dangerous and counterproductive. However, if these spendings were meant more to improve your competitivity, reduce unemployment through effective measures suh as less taxing the work but instead the (wealthy) retired ones, then I'm all for it. This is partly what Macron is actually intending to do in France (even if he's not really perfectly doing it and his communication is totally awful), and I think this is a more appropriate choice, but a risky political move because basically you're against a huge chunck of your electorate base: the pensioners.

That's why the populists in charge in Italy are trying to seduce the retired ones (forming the essential part of the Italian voters) even if it's jeopardizing their economy.

So, we are basically trapped in a dead end... If we help this government it will basically end up like Orban or in Romania: awful politicians benefiting from EU funds, and at the same time attacking the EU openly and each time increasing its voting base with popular measures but not necessarily doing the right thing to have your economy on track or in the Romanian case, worsening corruption and feeding a political elite instead of the people. And if we don't help them, then it will nevertheless increase their support because the populist parties will keep saying it's EU's fault for not doing anything and not showing solidarity etc.

What I believe, but I may be wrong, is we just lost a good opportunity in the past, because Italian economic problems are not new at all, and previous governments were which were favourable to the EU and in favour of reforms were left alone were they needed support, mainly due to Merkel intransigence, total focus on austerity, lack of courage in improving EU cohesion and financial integration.

Forced austerity in that period was clearly a bad move, and if greater EU funds for the 2009-2017 period had been sent to Italy when they had sensible governments which would have been ok to make reforms in exchange of more funds (basically a conditional transfer of money could have been implemented in exchange of needed reforms which would have bolstered the need to make this reforms), we wouldn't have the current Italian situation with populists in charge and endangering the whole EU project.

Although it is quite interesting to compare 2017 and 2006 revisions to see their projected numbers for 2050. For example 2017 revision ""added"" around 400M people to projected amount of people for ""medium level"".

*That's the fucking point.* The minimum wage is to low to seriously live on, especially in more expensive regions. Someone on minimum wage is forced to live a very ""modest"" lifestyle and then can rejoice if they manage to pay their standard expenses without slipping farther into the red. That's bullshit, a proper minimum wage should make sure that everybody working can properly live their life!

Even dumber, there are literally hundreds of thousands of people working full-time *being subsidised by Hartz4 anyway* ***because they don't earn enough to live***.

No because there haven't been any GDPR cases and there is no precedence. The paragraph you linked is sufficiently vague that the person you're replying to could be subject to extremely strict interpretations without such things.

The problem with just dismissively saying something isn't personal data is that you truly have no idea if that's correct or not. You don't know their database structure, their server logs, what their internal metrics are...and trust me it's entirely possible that the business doesn't know those things either. Is that a problem that they need to fix? Yes, for sure but those things cost money and resources they may value more than their European market. GDPR will put pressure on them to do so.

 GDPR is a good thing that is poorly written and implemented. It is far too vague and the penalties are so severe that they could outright kill a business who fails compliance.

5738,"The German one is kinda about that, although it first had some other stuff in there as well. The three stanzas as used originally, paraphrased:

1. Let's have one Germany, not fifty, because everyone who speaks German is a brother of mine. Also, here are some rough borders of where the people I'm talking about live.
2. We're cool dudes, our girls are hot and we party hard and that's what we should be known for.
3. When we do get our country it should be all about unity, peace and freedom because those are the foundation of a good life for everyone.

Unfortunately, starting with the first World War* and especially during the second one, the first stanza was repurposed as ""rah rah Germany #1"" and ""let's own half of Europe"" while the second was interpreted as ""all culture that isn't ours is kinda shitty"". The third one was too wholesome to corrupt.

In typical post-WW2 German fashion we first kept all three stanzas but decided that only the third one should be sung, because that makes sense. Meanwhile the GDR made its own anthem and then banned the lyrics in 1977 for being too subversive. When we reunified in 1991 we realized that it was silly that both German states had national anthems with lyrics that you weren't supposed to sing so we settled on just the third stanza as our national anthem.

Since then our anthem *is* about being excellent to each other – within the context of Germany.

5802,"Eastern Europe is fucked is every single aspect of it's being. I've lived here for almost 30 years and everything has gone from bad to worse, a constant decline. The economy is generally shit and the money generally goes to a few people, but at least for me, that's not the biggest issue in the game, well at least it's not the buying power of the individual. We're slowly turning into some off-shoot IT job dump and  most people are switching careers into programming and in a way this is good. The wages are low sure, but we can spend more and have a much more decent life. Problem is, there's not much *to* buy. Local goods importers buy shit tier items(clothes, tech you name it) from all over Europe and sell it here as high quality products. 
Amazon, aliexpress and others open up a much larger table of options but internet shopping is still very clunky on our end. Terrible post service etc. 
On the other hand, since corruption is through the roof and most of the money goes to a few people, on top of insane levels of nepotism and political favoritism when employing for state jobs every other realm suffers greatly. 


Education is just garbage. The best Uni in the country has fallen down some 2.5k spots in world ranking over the past 10 years. Constantly changing programs and curriculum, bad disengaged teachers/professors, bad teaching practices, terrible general idea of  low funding and you have trash system producing trash that perpetuates itself in a state of constant decay.

Industry has been dead ever since Yugoslavia fell apart and it will stay dead because we sold everything that we could into an industry. Literally no more than ten people became millionaires over night like this.  Not much else to say here.

Infrastructure is dwindling. Roads *are* getting repaired but they're doing a terrible job out of it so they quickly get damaged because of shit materials and bad work practice. Water supply systems are... old. Very old. And very bad. Pollution in the capital city is skyrocketing with no respite or real plans how to fix it.

Regarding healthcare, I'll dare say that good professionals do get produced by our education but the good ones bail out for the same reasons as everyone else. We get left with the shitty ones, who have to use second hand equipment that's been donated by another country.  Workers rights are a distant dream in here. And by this I mean most of the time don't bother dreaming you'll get paid for overtime, have an ethical workplace, employers who honor contracts, or God forbid have it easy with vacation days.

It's... just a mess. Please send someone who can fix it. We can't. 


edit: Culture is pretty much the most buried aspect of at least my country. We literally don't produce almost any, and the state finances only a few select of their own minions and they use this ""industry"" mostly to launder money. The artists that for some unbeknown to me reason *do* choose to pursuit a career usually don't get much to show for it. We don't like paying foreign artists for their work as well so concerts are out of the question 99% of the time as well.

I disagree. He went to the office of the FSB. Kind of like if Latvian/other Eastern European partisans went on a suicide bombing mission to a KGB office.

This guy did not target civilians, he specifically targeted an office of the FSB. That's the crux of the issue why I find it so morally grey - this was not a killer of innocents. The FSB as an institution is just not innocent. The question then remains - is indiscriminate targeting of FSB (or CIA, or KGB, or Gestapo) members okay?

I just genuinely do not know how to feel about this. You say that not to feel empathy is not right, but, again, had this been the Soviet KGB I would have cheered the hell out of the man for attacking tyrants.

That goes for practically all of France, you know, including Paris.

If Germany would pay any money now, it would be equal to a collective punishment of the German people, a thing that is prohibited in the Fourth Geneva Convention. In effect by demanding collective punishment, you tread on the very human rights that were established because of WW2 and what people fought for.

And don't come up with the stupid argument that Germany is the successor to Nazi Germany and therefore liable, the money would still come from the German people including me. 

So here's a challenge to you: Explain to me how I am in any way responsible for WW2 just because by pure chance i was born in Germany. And just to give you more information, my 1st grandfather who fought in the war was a so called Flak-Helfer up in Norway (conscripted at a young age late in the war) and my 2nd grandfather wasn't old enough to be conscripted. Yet my second-grandfather was deported from his home when the land was annexed by Poland and my grandmother from the same region was raped by members of the red-army.

So try it, bring up any reason why i should pay, yet i shouldn't be able to demand more (in money / assets) back because of what happened to my family.

Whatever your position is, you should be able to see the faulty reasoning of this logic. Or rather, the unethical consequences of it.

""Immigrants are here to fill empty jobs, not to compete with the locals"" could easily be used to justify firing an immigrant for the sake of hiring an unemployed local. Would you be okay with this?

&amp;nbsp;

5964,"Here, I'll provide a summary of the entire 15 stanza long song.

1: I am a man of the people, always faithful to the King.

2: I'm doing God's work, that's why I've been betrayed.

3: My people, pray that I may have strength, God will not forsake you.

4: As my brothers have shown, I have not forsaken you.

5: I have fought for my noble blood.

6: I am a servant of God, may he help me drive out tyranny.

7: May my oppressors not kill me, innocent servant of God.

8: As David fled the tyrant Saul, God made him a Kingdom.

9: May God grant me that I may die a hero of an eternal realm.

10: Nothing hurts me more than to see the King's lands suffer.

11: My armies have fought valiantly under my leadership.

12: It is the will of God that I vanquish this Tempest.

13: I have prayed to God, Christian as I am, to save my cause.

14: My sheep, your shepherd will not sleep until God has healed you.

15: God will see that I have never hated the King, but that I have obeyed Him, the highest authority.

So to summarize further: I am a faithful Christian and noble man of your people, I have obeyed His authority above the King, who is a tyrant that has made my people suffer, may God grant me that I vanquish this Tempest, found an eternal realm and die a hero.
