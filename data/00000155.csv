All of the times when the Bible talks about homosexuality being ""wrong"" have actually originally been orders for the Jews (orders most of which Christians generally don't follow), and referring to shrine prostitution and whatever, or meant something entirely else before translation.


For example, the 1 Corinthians thing about homosexuals not going to Heaven. There, the original word used was ""arsenokoites"", and *nobody knows for sure what was meant with it.* Looking at other instances when it was used in texts of that time, the actual meaning seems to be *sexual activity between a man and a boy* (pedophilia, if you need that clarification), and/or *violent, economic oppression*

While this is happening, that our industry is payng us less to remain competitive, at the same time our internal market is shrinking because of low wage, making export even more necessary to oir industry to survive.  
Basicaly we export because our economy is to shit to survive on our own and we need to sell our manufactured product to Germany because we are to poor to buy it.  
  

About the centralized money currency, it is true that actualy we have the Ecb performing the Qe and that it is partialy benefitting us, but it is also true that they are missing most of their objective like the inflation one that every year is lower than expected.  Even the way the Qe is managed is flawed. They are pushing easy money in banks with the hope that they put that money in circle but that is happening at a lower rate than expected and so the beneficial effect of the Qe are lowered. 
There are many other way to reich this objective but the point is that the Qe is the compromise between the Ecb and other country that are not that entusiast about this politics.

136,"""a statement issued yesterday by the Permanent Commission on Historical Memory of the Council of the President of the Russian Federation. It’s worth translating this in full:""

&gt;We have heard that monuments to I.V. Stalin are being constructed in towns in Russia.

&gt;Those of our fellow citizens and those political forces, who are prepared to forget and even justify the death and deprivation of freedom of millions of our compatriots, incite both bitterness and sympathy. Those who were victims of political repression, the deportation of peoples, collectivization, and the Holodomor, were often the best in the country. These repressions are firmly connected to the name of I.V. Stalin.

&gt;And those who erect monuments voluntarily or involuntarily justify these repressions. These fellow citizens of ours are also victims of that regime: they’ve lost their sense of sympathy for our deeply suffering country.

&gt;We do not call for the establishment of monuments to I.V. Stalin on private plots of land to be banned. But civil servants of all levels must know that it is impermissible to allow state or municipal land or buildings to be used for this purpose. Such acts not only contradict morality and respect for our deceased, innocently suffering predecessors, but also contradict official state policy.

&gt;As is noted in the Concept of State Policy on the Immortalization of the Memory of Victims of Political Repression, confirmed by the Government of Russia on 15 August 2015, ‘Attempts to justify the repressions by the particular circumstances of the time or generally to deny them as a fact of our history are impermissible.’

&gt;In his speech at the opening in the centre of Moscow of the grandiose ‘Wall of Grief’ – a memorial to the victims of political repression, our head of state V.V. Putin said that, ‘When talking about the repressions, death and suffering of millions of people, there can be no justifications of these crimes.’

&gt;We believe that our children and grandchildren, through dialogue and joint interpretation will reach a common assessment of an era which was tragic for Russia, and for all the peoples of the 20th Century Soviet Union – an era of revolutions, wars, repressions, but also heroic accomplishments of the people, the most important of which was victory in the Great Patriotic War. In the meantime, we cannot allow the desecration of the memory of the victims of the past century.",Montenegro,/r/europe/comments/cck4f8/rehabilitating_stalin_russian_government/etnf1i6/,Glideer,1562985254

And truth be told, a lot of Britons never really got over winning the second world war. In fact, among Brexiteers there's a current trend where they imagine themselves as heroes of the second world war, it's an absurd, distorted fantasy, of course which has a nationalistic make-up ""hurr durr, we won ww2"". No, you fucken' didn't, you didn't do shite, and actually [Britain's ww2 generation is almost as pro-remain as the millennials are](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/brexit/2019/04/05/britains-wartime-generation-are-almost-as-pro-eu-as-millennials/).  
Oh and of course, it is the brexiteer politicians who compare brexit to winning the 2nd world war against the nazis and fascists. If that's not a brain-worms-level insane fantasy, then I don't know what is, mate.   

Going back to the imperialistic nuances of Brexit, they're incredibly obvious, from the brexit campaign using trumpesque slogans like ""Let's put Great in Great Britain again"" to their foreign secretary (at that time, now maybe future Prime Minister Boris Johnson) espousing pro-empire poetry during his visit in Myanmar.   
And let's not forget how brexiteers cried gleefully about the commonwealth, about going back to it, that surely their long time ""friends"" will welcome the with open arms and listen and obey to whatever the UK has to say, only to be met with succinct, brutal refusals by everyone in the commonwealth. To their surprise, the commonwealth didn't want British rule again, but imagine this, these countries wanted to take advantage of the situation for their own well-being.  
Britain has forgotten in what conditions it was upon entering the EU, the sheer state of decline it was experiencing before ascending to the Union, to the point that it was known as ""the sick man of Europe"".  
They see the numbers and think of themselves as the 5th or 6th strongest countries in the world. But that's not true, that's a lie by omission, in fact the cold truth is that they're the 5th or 6th strongest countries in the world ***as members of the European Union.***  
Brexit will lead to Britain's self-destruct. The desire for independence from the British union grows stronger and stronger both in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Even fucking Wales wants independence https://twitter.com/EuropeElects/status/1142462197701984256?s=19

234,"&gt;Now just so Estonian dont play the surprised pikachu card, creating stateless people is very, very poorly seen. I'm actually surprise that did not prevent you from joining the EU.

It's not fully honest to claim that Estonia created them. Republic of Estonia was restored in 1991 and Estonian citizenship continued to be passed on through generations. Technically, Estonia didn't take or give citizenships, it merely restored the old ones and because citizenship is based on *ius sanguinis* (citizenship is passed on from parents to children), most people just got it because their parents had it. This included almost all of Estonians but also some Russians who live here before WWII, but excluded Soviet migrants, which majority of Russians (and Ukrainians, Belarusians) were.

There were now Soviet citizens (minority) and Estonian citizens in Estonia, but Republic of Estonia was an independent country, so the former were technically foreign citizens in Estonia. Because Soviet Union itself collapsed soon after, Soviet citizenship had no meaning, and they became stateless. So now the question is, who is responsible. From Estonian perspective, Soviet Union was an illegal occupation regime and Russia is the successor state of it, so... Russia. From Russian perspective, these were people living in Estonia and because it sees current states as successors to respective USSR republics (a view categorically rejected by Baltics), obviously Estonia.

Now in practice, of course Estonia could have given all permanent residents citizenship from day one, as Lithuania did. This was not done to:

* delegitimize Soviet authority and enforce the legal continuation of Republic of Estonia
* encourage integration by making it mandatory to know the state language in order to acquire citizenship
* roll back at least some of the mass immigration which had put Estonians onto trend of becoming a minority in their own native lands

You could argue whether these points would outweigh the problems, but Estonia decided they would.

&gt;Most of the planet dont know about it, nor care. But If someday it comes to the attention of the masse in EU. You will be in trouble.

I don't think so. Russia likes to overdramatize the issue in order to score domestic points in favour of the authority and show how evil its neighbours are, how Russians are mistreated abroad and how you should totally fully support us because otherwise these fascists will come and kill/oppress you.

The stateless people are issued travel documents and can freely travel in the EU and Russia. This is actually one of the primary reasons majority of them have not bothered to acquire neither Estonian nor Russian passport. The secondary reason is that they avoid also conscription in both countries. They have all the basic rights and are pretty much like foreign citizens residing in Estonia. Yes, there's a problem that essentially no state backs them up, but... it's up to these people to change that.

The thing is that language-based integration is a core value in this country and we completely reject the model other ex-USSR countries have ended up in where Russian language remains *language of interethnic communication*. Here, it's the local language alone that has that role. So if you are unwilling to leave your Russian-speaking world, you can always choose another country to live (such as Russia) or live here as a foreigner. But if you don't bother to learn our language, you don't have a say in our country's future. It's simple as that and I find it really reasonable.",Eesti,/r/europe/comments/cb64jr/eu_population_by_citizenship_2018/etn26zs/,toreon,1562974670
235,"There's no communistic state that was a succes or is a succes...

Communism requiers an all or nothing engagement and elected hierarchy (every one votes his above leader) and can't work with dissidents..

Because the worker ""class"" (guess what, your classless society if you actually bother to read Marx has leaders that are simply another class) won't matter that much when deciding who leads but his leader does.. 

As such, instead of what we now have as election promises to the masses there everyone would just make them to the ones below them to be elected (simplified example: president to county leaders to factory leaders to workers).

349,"&gt;Do you think capitalist countries don't have resource scarcity ever?

Having resource scarcity is not the same as creating resource scarcity by terrible policy decisions. The Soviet Union normally didn't have food scarcity but because of Stalin's forced industrialization and forced urbanization policies, a lot of arable land was abandoned because the peasants were forcefully moved to live in cities and work in factories. In some extreme cases such as Ukraine, this lead to the starvation of millions.

&gt;Most of those who lived in east germany think there was more good than bad. 

That's indicative of whether or not the country was actually doing well economically. People's perception of the past tend to be heavily biased especially old people who tend to look back to their younger days with fondness (although that's not true for my grandfather who pretty much  despised the communist regime from day 1).

A lot of the policies that communists governments in Eastern Europe enacted sounded good on paper (free housing, redistribution of land, free healthcare, free education) but the problem is that those policies were unsustainable (Yugoslavia for example was insanely overspending its money and by the 1980s it was one of the most indebted countries in the world and similar problems occurred in East Germany, Hungary and Romania too). Also the other issue is that these post ww2 socialist regimes demonstrated that the state is extremely inefficient and incompetent at managing economic assets. Like sure it was nice that during socialist Yugoslavia my hometown had more than 4 factories and everyone had a job but those factories were extremely unprofitable and had to be propped up by the state which of course led to the state burrowing more and more loans while pretending that everything is fine and socialism works.",Serbia,/r/europe/comments/ccf0hj/portugal_three_months_before_the_general_election/etmrutd/,Petique,1562967017

If it's wrestling or something she'll have problems no matter what she does if he's reasonably in shape and fit.

Trans women can qualify for quite a lot of things simply because of their advantage as a biological males. The skill/strength/speed gap between men and women in sports is usually quite big after all.

He's not a world class professional weightlifter or whatever, he's just a guy who likes going to the gym and lift weights.

They only seem to care about drownings. Don't you think that's a weird version of philanthropy?

If they really cared they should support ways of immigration that don't involve traffickers. But these ways of immigration would make NGOs useless, so gang rapes and slavery is fine as long as migrants turn up to the Mediterranean as customers.

&gt; As for maternal leave being supported by biology: believe it or not, pregnancy and labour take a toll on woman's body, of course every woman is different, but generally bodies need some time to recover, and this time is provided by maternity leave. 

And during the time she's suffering that toll, she could use some care and support from her man. Paternal leave would be great for that!

This is a lie.

Germany stationed its patriot batteries in Turkey for **three years**. The Netherlands stationed them for **two years**. The US also for **two years**. And Spain for **three years**.

Nobody stationed them for just a couple of months.

&gt; the war has been going on for over 7 years.

Another lie. The first western patriot batteries arrived in Turkey in January of 2013. The Syrian civil war started in March of 2011. That's not 7 years.

&gt; US refused to station patriots in Turkey

Another lie. As I pointed out above, the US stationed patriots in Turkey for a full two years.

&gt; The senate has blocked Turkey from buying Patriots 3 times in the past (over a period of 30+ years).

Again, a lie. First of all, the Patriot-3 hasn't even existed for that long, so it is simply not possible for the US to have blocked its sale to Turkey for over 30 years.

Secondly, the US has in fact offered to sell the Patriot to Turkey on multiple occasions; Turkey has rejected these offers because of their demand that the sale include the transfer of technology. The US of course, has the full right *not* to transfer said technology as part of the deal.

&gt;  The tech transfer deal is only offered by Russia

593,"&gt; A junta overthrew the goverment and started to massacre turks, with the goal of joining greece, which was forbidden :):):). And we were a guarantor. **We used it.** 

Being a guarantor allowed you to intervene, not to occupy 40% of the country. I agree that Turkey had a right to intervene but the reality (that you never mention) is that you did way more, aka violating the ceasefire AFTER the massacres had stopped and AFTER the junta had been overthrown, you occupied a much larger are when you had no right to, and you brought settlers in from mainland Turkey (why would you do that if your plan wasn't to occupy the country in the first place?). You *used* (as you said) that as an excuse to do what you blame Greece of trying to do and everyone agrees it's illegal.

&gt; It was so fucking legal that in comparison, rest of the world became illegal for a while, just due to the stark contrast opposed to how extremely fucking legal our invasion was. 

That sentense is so fucked up i almost got an aneurysm. In case you missed it, INTERVENING, was legal. OCCUPYING and bringing in settlers was not. There were two invasions in Cyprus. The second one was plain illegal. Prove me wrong if you can. You're literally defending something that's forbidden by the Geneva Convention. Talk about high horses eh?

&gt; Afterwards when you and your boys in cyprus, showed little to none sign for any kind of good-will , desire for peace or a common solution that we just said ""fuck it"" 

Again, what are you talking about? What good will? Our junta was overthrown and you showed no sign of leaving the island. You didn't say ""fuck it"" and stayed there against your will. You were more than happy with your extra land.

&gt; Annan plan. Were you punks ? were EU and US punks ? Are you that fucking dense that you can't block a last minute addition ? No you were fine with it, everyone was fine with it, I was not, but my country was fine with it. South simply didn't want it. Just like south simply doesn't recognize north, nor unify with north.  

What punks are you talking about? We can't block an addition. Each side can make an addition whenever it wants, and the other side can reject it. That's literally what happened. The plan was drafted and Turkey brought EXTRA terms on the table 2 days before it was over, and that's when the Greek side rejected the deal. 

For the record i will state again that literally no country in the world other than Turkey recognizes the TRNC. It's not just Greece. There's a good reason for it you know.

&gt; Also no you don't have the support of 168 countries. You have the support of 3, Israel, egypt and southern cyprus. The rest don't get to have a say in that. 

Huh? Every country so far agrees that this is Cyprus's EEZ. The fact that you choose to ignore other countries doesn't say anything. Even the ones you mentioned are 3 more countries than Turkey has support from (which is 0). You're literally the only country in the worldc thinking you're right in this. I'm not sure why you can't grasp it.

&gt; If not, well we can always annex it. 

What were you saying about my glorious perspective and feeling like Leonidas? :') You're free to try to annex it. As if you weren't wrong enough already lol.

&gt;  One thing that won't happen is it won't get solved with threats, bullying, propaganda and refusing to accept simple concerns  

Literally it only takes the Turkish (and Greek) army to withdraw and it will be much, much simpler. Greece already suggested that both armies leave the island. Turkey rejected it. We all know why.

&gt; Maybe that island thats smaller than my neighbourhood which I can swim to in 10 minutes shouldn't be yours if it commands literally the quarter of the fucking eastern mediterrenean ? 

Maybe you shouldn't have lost that island if you want it? By the same mentality, i can also swim to the Turkish shores in 10 minutes from our islands. Maybe the Turkish shores should be ours? Whoever told you that proximity is a legit factor of owning land, is a retard. Eastern Thrace is closer to Greece than it is with most of Turkey. Perhaps it should be ours? Is that how it goes? Nope. 

&gt; Because turkey would claim that island before hacing to accept any restrictions by that treaty. Maybe we should and then ratify it. Now, did you realize how aggressive and outrageous this sounded ? Thats what you are doing and have been doing in Aegean ever since 70s. 

The big difference is that Turkey has already signed and ratified a treaty renouncing claoms on all island other than the ones that are within 3 n.m of its shores. If you can make Greece have an agreement giving you the islands and you sign and ratify it, good for you. Until then the islands are Greek per international treaties. Your access in the Mediterranean isn't our concern. You can still sail through those waters under the Law of Innocent Passage. It's not written anywhere that Turkey SHOULD have access in the Aegean. You lost the islands, too bad. We lost Istanbul, too bad. It's not a 50/50 split. 

&gt; No one will get no where with unilaterally imposing and pressuring each other. 

Turkey is the only one unilaterally doing anything, cause it's alone in its claims. If you want to send a ship in your waters, do you ask permission from Greece to do it? No, you just do it cause it's your right to do it. You do it unilaterally cause you have the right to. Likewise, Greece has the right to those waters and everyone else agrees with that. 

&gt; Thats what I mean by spoiled. Its sad tbh, arguably the most accomplished and respected nation on the planet is reduced its ethos to a simple anti-turk chauvanism that moves forward only with russian and western half-pity half-imperialistic pushes every now and then. Very sad. 

Dude don't go there, it's sad. Turkey is just as spoilled, you keep getting away with things simply because people let you have the Bosporus. You have been bailed out countless times because of your location and you've been the USA's lapdog for decades. Just.. don't, lol.

&gt;&gt; What report
&gt;
&gt;A little googling : https://www.foi.se/rest-api/report/FOI-R--4651--SE
&gt;
&gt;tldr; ""The S-400 air defence system is often claimed to have a 400-km range, but FOI’s technical experts estimate that the effective range against maneuvering targets at low altitude is much less, even down to 20 km for smaller targets hugging the terrain. Russian specialists have estimated the effective range of the S-400 against old and un-stealthy Tomahawk cruise missiles to be 24–36 km in mixed terrain.""

Of course, that does for ever air defense system, and it has nothing to do with the Russians oversstating their capabilities. 

Manufacturers tend to give one number which is some maximum practical range. For Aster it's 100 or so km, but that doesn't mean they can hit a low flying tomahawk at that range.


&gt;Because it seems they are the one who publicly studied the most the S-400

That report isn't even close to what I'd describe as a study of S-400, there's very little information about the system itself.

If anything, the report is a brief overview of Russian air defense, anti naval and ground strike capabilities, with myth busting of the perceptions influenced by sensationalism in the popular media.",Rep.

Well that's gold coming from a country that keeps giving us trouble about the islands and is occupying half of Cyprus 45 years later. It's not like we're obsessed with you for no reason.

It goes both ways ;)

714,"&gt;The issue you place to much weight on that and too little on the last 200 years or so which included cultural reformation with the goal of uniting the region, plus Yugoslavia itself too. The fact that one side was under the Austrian boot and the other under a Turkish one matters little after all that thanks to a shared culture, which is still here today. The pop-culture scene, from music, to movies, to shit like YouTube and memes is still one. 

&gt;And again, all this left a lesser impact than those 70 years of Yugoslavia. What difference does that make nowadays that all speak the same language, listen to the same music, watch the same movies, interact together all the time, etc. Sure, that's left some differences, but little ones. Despite being under different influence historically, today you can find people from Belgrade and Zagreb listening to the same music, by a guy from Sarajevo, or any other combination.

&gt;I rarely see anyone separate those two, especially not Croatia, since again, the ex-Yu is culturally so closely tied together. You again underestimate the impact of Yugoslavia and overestimate the impact of times before there were even any cultural movements.

OK, what you need to understand is that grouping by historical, cultural and religious criteria is not something I adhere to just for the hell of it, it is the default academic standard and has been since the Great Schism split Christian Europe in two, it is literally the starting point of any ""Divisions of Europe"" map:

&gt; Europeans have traditionally viewed Europe and the Mediterranean as having an East/West cultural split. Cultures associated with the historical Iberians, Goths, Franks, Hungarians, Lithuanians, Celts, West Slavs and the historical Roman Catholic Church (Central and Western Europe) have traditionally been considered *Western*; these cultures adopted Latin as their lingua franca in the Middle Ages. 

&gt;Cultures associated with the Byzantine and Russian Empires (Greeks, Orthodox Slavs (East and South Slavs), Romanians and to a lesser extent Albanians) have traditionally been considered *Eastern*; these cultures all used Greek or Old Church Slavonic as a lingua franca during the early Middle Ages. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_East_and_Latin_West

I can't simply disregard these ^ long-established cartography standards, if we applied the ""listen to the same music, watch the same movies"" grouping criteria to regionalize the rest of Europe what kind of borders would we end up with? That kind of arbitrary social grouping criteria is fine for meme-tier ""Potato Europe/Tomato Europe"" mapping but its simply not going to pass muster in a formal, academic context, which is what I'm aiming for with my map.

In any case, I'm fine with agreeing to disagree. :)

&gt;Maybe I should only started Italy's south from the point it becomes a peninsula and left the Alpine region as central. 

I initially put all of Italy under Southern Europe but the distinctly more Germanic character of the northern tip simply necessitated a shift to Central Europe. 

&gt;Didn't think too much of the French coast, but you could include it, which would give you an uninterupted south Europe from the Atlantic coast to the Bosphorus.

Well, yeah, the French Rivieria is textbook Med and distinct enough from the north to justify shifting it out of Western Europe. No Frenchies have complained about it so far!

&gt;I'm torn on the UK as I seen it listed as both Western and Northern. So I though, maybe just include the northern part as, well, northern? Though thinking back it could all go as western.

UK and Ireland are a package deal because both comprise the British Isles, if you put the Irish into Northern i.e. Protestant Europe shit would hit the fan real fast. :D Just leave em both in Western, it doesn't generate any historical or cultural contradictions.

&gt;Latvia and Lithuania are definitely eastern.

Don't let them hear you say that!

&gt;Another is, where is the center of Europe? Looking at this map you'd think at first glance, maybe Hungary or Slovakia. But then you realize Europe stretches to the Urals, and just how huge Russia is, and that it also stretches to the north of Scandinavia, and if you count islands, even Iceland or even the Arctic islands. So, where is the center? The claims all over the place, from the Ruhr, to the Dresden, Slovekia, Western Ukraine, Poland and even Lithuania. So, maybe Lithuania is actually central Europe, and with it all the Balts, and a bit of Russia to, and Belarus. And Germany is entirely WE. The Panonian basin would then be SE. Or maybe it really is Poland, which again would make it definitely CE. Or maybe it's in Belarus? It's complicated.

The geographic center of Europe? Depends on what you consider Europe's outer borders, since where you measure from changes the location. But of course there's a Wikipedia article for just that:

Now... because i just disputed Istanbul's sovereignty, i expect you not to conduct any business in Istanbul.   
\^\^ Does the above sentence make any sense to you? If Greece arbitrarily claimed something Turkish, without any support and asked Turkey not to exploit that area because it's ""disputed"", would Turkey follow suit? No, it'd completely ignore it. The fact that Turkey doesn't want to go by the international law doesn't mean it's right about it. 

&gt; Turkey was open and eager to talk these through. It was your side that unilaterally declared disputed territories as your EEZ's. 

We didn't do it unilaterally. We're backed by 168 countries. Everyone agrees it's our right to have that EEZ. The very concept of the EEZ exists because of UNCLOS. Turkey was very eager to bargain about something it had no right over. For example, I'm extremelly eager to bargain about your house. Let's sit and talk how we're going to split your house and how much of it i'm going to take. Are you willing to do that? If not why are you the bad guy for not wanting to bargain about something that's rightfully yours? No matter how much of it i unilaterally claim, if my claim is not supported by anyone, you will ignore it and rightfully so.

&gt; See we are drilling too. 

Yes, except everyone agrees that Cyprus (not ""we"", Greece isn't drilling) can drill in its own EEZ and everyone says that you can't. [Even Russia](http://www.ekathimerini.com/242404/article/ekathimerini/news/athens-paris-moscow-and-cairo-urge-ankara-not-to-violate-cyprus-sovereignty) is telling you that you're not right in this. You know you've fucked up when the USA, the EU AND RUSSIA agree that you're wrong, lol. You can whistle indifferently but don't try to claim that you're right and everyone else is wrong.

&gt;It was the south not the north that refused the referandum that UN,US,Turkey,EU agreed to. You are refusing to unify and refusing to recognize north at the same time. 

Wrong, the ""south"" was agreeing to the reunification, until Turkey pushed Annan to make additions to the plan in the last moment, adding ridiculous terms to the deal, and the others went with it because they wanted to get the whole thing over with. That's when the South and Greece rejected it of course. 

Turkey recently rejected another reunification attempt even though Greece offered that both countries remove their armed forces from the island and Turkey refused. There can be no reunification with foreign forces there. Turkey is trying to hold the island a hostage with its troops there. 

And no, it's not us that refuse to recognize the north. Literally every country there is, except for Turkey, doesn't recognize the pseudostate. Mostly because you sent settlers there illegally. 

&gt; Refusing to let north side has its share, refusing to negotiate a co-operation in this matter by basically bribing oil companies of powerful states and you act shocked when Turkey intervenes on North's behalf. 

Lmao implying that Turkey wants those resources for the TRNC and not itself. The northern part is not a sovereign country, it's not recognized by anyone. As long as Turkey keeps its army there illegally, its denying those people their share. Cyprus is a recognized country and it has an EEZ. The Northern part doesn't. Turkey is illegal in its actions any way you look at it. You're occupying the island illegally, you don't have any legal foothold in this. You can bully the island but don't complain that people call you out for it.

&gt; Its amazing how all of you lads think you are right at. every. single. little. issue. 

I mean... when everyone agrees with us... maybe you just so happen to be wrong? You're literally defending an illegal occupation  that no one else in the world recognizesand you think that you deserve a share of another country's reserves AFTER you've been holding 40% of their lands for 45 years, and you're trying to claim a moral high ground and blame us for victimization attempts?

One of the saddest parts of German anti-Semitism in the early 20^th century (i.e. before the Nazis seized power) was that the Jewish community in Germany was integrated and assimilated into society almost to the point of unrecognisability.

738,"[An older but very interesting paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270652051_The_Role_of_the_Gulf_Stream_in_European_Climate) (2015) that talks about the influences of the Gulf Stream on the European climate which concludes with:
&gt;... decadal and longer-scale variability of the Gulf Stream's heat transport manifests in changes in European temperature, precipitation, and storminess. Given that anthropogenic climate change is projected to weaken the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, associated changes in European climate are expected. However, large uncertainty in the magnitude of the anticipated weakening undermines the predictability of the future climate in Europe.

Then there is a more accesible document published by the University of Hamburg Center for Earth Science in which they go through the physics, role and future predictions for the Gulf Stream influence. It also concludes with:

&gt;Although the abrupt cooling in Europe in response to a sudden collapse of the overturning circulation is anxiously debated by the public, scientists consider this scenario to be extremely unlikely. Nonetheless, researchers are seriously worried about the allegedly certain slowdown and the associated risks. These include positive feedbacks, which further aggravate global warming, cause long-term and irreversible shifts in precipitation patterns, or provide additional impetus for the already dangerous sea-level rise, especially in the northern mid-latitudes. A significant slowdown in the circulation would defi nitely have considerable aftereffects on the climate, sea level, the carbon cycle, and marine ecosystems. 

So it would most definitely have an effect on the climate of North West Europe and most likely Europe as a whole but it's very unlikely that it could lead to Arctic conditions in Stockholm if it stopped.",European Union,/r/europe/comments/cby4tk/stockholms_climate_in_2050_will_resemble/etljts6/,this_toe_shall_pass,1562938392

744,"&gt; Please stop to ""put it simple"". It's a scheme that would have netted them $65m. That's not peanuts, not even for the bigger players in organized crime. 

the italian mafia has a turnover of 100**bn** dollars per year, it's profit are estimated in the range of 50**bn** dollars. per year.

so no, this is not entirely correct, this is one scheme amongst others given the actual economical size of that apparatus.

it is absolutely correct to say that this is not peanuts, especially for a politician, not a mafia family, and in fact this, together with a previous scandal involving salvini that you haven't heard of that was worth 46mn euros, well those two things are actually impacting on Salvini, he is using the immigrant card in the most awful way to over this up with distractions and such and the fact that our media conglomerate during Berlusconi had basically been concentraded only in a few people's hand the covering of this is not nearly sufficient, but as I said, he is also doing a good job in other areas and this is not the worse scandal that i can see could be attached to him.

&gt; You are confronted with this scheme of Salvini and still manage to say ""they reinvigorated Italians belief in civic values"". At what point is someone willfully ignorant or simply brainwashed?

You still don't understand what I've told you tho , yes there is a lot wrong with italian voters, apathy mainly, disbelief in the system because they've been trying to fight the corruption since the 90s, and a lot of those issues very common in europe, but we don't have the issues that you think we have.

You should ask yourselves how come we are still one of the big economies in Europe if this has been going on at this level since 199 (at least), look at the other big mafia state, Russia, they don't seem to be able to make it work as good as we do, what's the difference here? what's happening in russia and in italy? what is a mafia state?

only after you pondered about that you should ask yourself what's our role in Europe, what's the latest debacles between us and europe are all about (hint, nobody cares about us supporting the russians or getting money from them).

Now I understand where you're coming from, I'm actually half german, I have been through the experience of explaining to a german italian politics before, I know how hard it is for you to understand us, I can only ask you to try hard, we're not what you think we are, the electorate is as mature as the german one, but we have a different set of ethics, and we've been through different things in the 80s and 90s.

In order to understand the modern italian state and it's shortcomings you have to also understand the [years of lead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Years_of_Lead_(Italy)), it's in that climate that the italian state started failing for real, especially in the south, were eventually specific cultural conditions gave raise to a parallel system, mainly a social and economical support network tied to family and religion, that could survive the failure of the state actually plunging it as a resource.

You have to understand that mafia is a social phenomenon, we're not talking about 10.000 people here, we're not talking about gangs of hundreds, we're talking about MILLIONS of people involved, most of which do not even carry out violent activities, mafia here is the bank director, the biggest land owner in a region that is actually leasing to businesses, it's judges and policemen / military people, doctors and engineers and lawyers.

they vote, they count, they also conceive the world in the wrong way, and they're still a minority of the population, that's the kind of cultural battle that we're actually fighting here in Italy.

You do not have anything even remotely similar to this and you don't understand that besides this there's also other things in Italy, those that make up the fourth economy on the continent, in relation to that we have very very reasonable demands towards Europe that really do affect the real italian population which are not understood by, especially, germans because they can't see past the very big issue of corruption, do not apply the same rules that you use in germany to understand what is corruption here.

namely, about Salvini, yes he still has my support, you know why? he's not a mafia man, he hasn't worked with them, our previous center-right leader did, big time, I'm talking about Berlusconi, so yeah, he's improvement over Berlusconi, and if this takes him down and a lot less corrupt one comes along I'll even be happier.
Berlusconi didn't just embezel money, if only, Berlusconi hijacked entire sectors of the economy for himself, including media, and had been working closely with the mafia for decades.

On the other side, the left, in fact the previous leader/govt had been disgraced after it came to light that he probably concocted a scheme to embezel the money from a failing bank, it's harder to determine how much of a cut the politicians could have gotten in that case but we're probably talking about similar amounts (tens of millions)

so last elections most left wing voters had enough of this shit and elected the left-wing populists, with our very own very young newcomer to politics, who's now governing with Salvini, is hell of a lot cleaner when it comes to corruption than Salvini is and gave us what basically amounts to UBI.

what's gonna happen to Salvini now? watch, we don't know, somebody from his own ranks could try to take the lead in the party and maybe they'll get somebody who not only is not a mafia man but it's also not corrupt as Salvini has been.",,/r/europe/comments/cbkn9o/matteo_salvini_under_fire_for_taped_league/etljwxk/,dada_216,1562938458

So, a few days ago, the newspaper *Mediapart* (famous for disclosing how the National Front misused European funds, started the Benalla affair, and led the revelations concerning Nicolas Sarkozy and his ties to Kaddhafi, including the possibility that the war may have been used to shut him up) disclosed that François de Rugy, minister of Ecology and number 2 of the Government (behind Prime Minister's **Edouard Philippe**), may have **invited friends at the Lessaye Hotel when he was President of the Assemblée Nationale**, our house of representative.

The important thing Mediapart is insisting on is that these weren't formal meetings, but just de Rugy and his wife, Servat-de Rugy, inviting their friends. Including well known journalist *Jean-Michel Apathy*, known for being close to the Authorities, who himself said those meals were a bit awkward (something along the lines of : lunch is fine, diner is sketchy, I didn't really felt like I belonged)

The day after, *Mediapart* released a new article : when he occupied the flat that went with the Ecology Ministry, he ordered 63k€ of repairs, including a 17k€ custom dressing room. The other important fact is that the contracts weren't given to the companies that proposed a low price. de Rugy's defense is that they weren't good enough companies to be trusted with such ancient goods. 

We also learned that his Head of Cabinet has been living for 12 years in Social Housing despite earning way too much. **He forced her to resign by the end of the day where it was leaked.**

Finally, we learned this morning that he bought a house ""with a Social Housing vocation"" in which he hasn't been living for years.

But what your ""both real and fake"" principle is absolute nonsense. It's completely the same as with truth and lie. There is no such a thing as half-truth. 

I will give you a simile to highlight this absurdity. For example there will be a picture of me when I was three. I will photoshop it together with my adult picture in a way that I have my legs as a three year old and my upper body as an adult. I will put this as my profile picture and claim it's me.

894,"&gt;That's pure nitpicking. Everyone knows what the title means by this.

Clearly not everyone. Obviously, Eurocentism is to be expected, as until recently the Western culture held a dominant position in the world, but do we really want statements such as ""the rest of the world"" to mean ""actually a smart portion of the world""? I don't like when the language is convoluted like that.

&gt;You pretend to be inclusive, yet you assumed I was American, because you couldn't comprehend the idea that a person from Europe can have an opinion different from yours.

Your opinion just sounded very American-liberal like, that's why I assumed that.

&gt;Should I therefore assume that you're an American pretending to be Polish?

Masz prawo zakładać sobie co tylko zapragniesz. Nie byłby to pierwszy raz kiedy twoje założenia okazałyby się błędne w tej dyskusji.

&gt;
And now it's not.

And we'll see how long the current fad will last. Western culture is all about changing your values, so various versions of it are mutually incompatible within a lifetime of a one person.

&gt;I don't know how relevant it is, you tell me. You're the one who brought it up in the first place

You were the one who claim that we should use the term ""the rest of the world"" to mean ""a handful of carefuly selected countries"".

&gt;So wait, are you in favor of Western ideals, or against them? because just few comment s before you were defending them. 

I like my own interpretation of Western ideals, appearing to be close to how a typical understanding of them in Poland is, not affected by the drastic post-1968 shifts that occured in some other Western countries, which is neither the one pushed by left-wingers in USA and some western European countries and you seem to subscribe to, nor the one which was widespread during the peak of the Western influence (late 19th-early 20th century).

&gt;don't see ""picking and choosing"" in ""The Union is founded on the values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities. These values are common to the Member States in a society in which pluralism, non-discrimination, tolerance, justice, solidarity and equality between women and men prevail. "". 

This is a set of values outlined in one of the treaties or documents, not an encyclopedic definition of ""Western values"" either. The EU does not get to define what ""Western values"" are, they can define what the values of their organization are at best.

&gt;Yet, the treaty remains in power for as long as Poland chooses to stay in the EU. 

The treaty is written broadly enough, that you cannot force us to follow a certain ideology on a basis of it.

&gt;Perhaps you should opt for a Polexit, if it' bothers you.

I do hope we leave the EU the moment its disadvantage will outweigh its advantages.

928,"&gt; values arent incompatible

The problem is that the values even among Latvians are absolutely incompatible. Some from my family believe gays are horrible degenerate pedophiles. Some believe that women should shut the fuck up and be subordinate to men. Some believe boys should only do sports and not doing sports is a sign of degeneracy. These are not foreigners - these are not even people from a far away region - these are people whose values are absolutely incompatible with mine, yet somehow we do exist together in one state, call each other fellow Latvians and family.

People are not completely disconnected from their culture, that is true, but in no way are people perfect copies of their culture, and it is foolish to base identity off of a weird checklist, since we'd probably have to strip the identity of many of our own countrymen (or even ourselves, if it does not fit the majority views). 

Yes, there are more women hating Muslims, yes they are more for traditional family values - but that in no way means someone who is Muslim is necessarily a woman hating bigot. He might be more respectful for womens freedom of choice than a local atheist solely because of his own personal identity in which the specific tenants of Islam do not take such a hardcore role in shaping his attitude towards women. 

Sure, we can talk about metrics like Hofstedes cultural dimensions etc., yet, again, these show the average - the general picture - and it does not tell the whole story of just how gradient the world is when it comes to identity. 

My point is - integration and assimilation is more about the self-perception of the person, not them adhering to a checklist. A german speaking christian turk in Germany who primarily identifies as turkish is integrated or assimilated? An English speaking muslim pakistani who primarily identifies as english is integrated or assimilated? A Brit from Gibraltar who only speaks Spanish, but is christian and loves the queen, beer and fish &amp; chips is integrated, assimilated or not British at all?

and until there is a legitimite revolution of life based on the inner most feelings of a society i consider the west as pinnacle of human evolution.

Also, what does it mean that ""anyone who matters"" - I though we were talking about the general Hungarian population, not some few high-profile people.

&gt; Good thing she was showing her support not to Orban's cultists

That's like half of the voting population that you are talking about. If she wanna turn them against her, it's her choice. But usually, you don't see foreign politicians actively choosing to alienate a half of the voters in an allied country.

&gt; This is just offensively stereotypical.

Orbán knows his own voters better than you. If he did not think statements that he makes about the glorious Hungarian nation help him with the Hungarian population, he would not be using them.

&gt; She won it because she never humiliated anyone, and because she kept telling it like it is. 

She was making a campaign in Slovakia, on the top of that the conditions originated from the murders of Kuciak and his fiancé were massively working in he favour. She had better conditions than any liberals in any V4 country thanks to that, however horrifying the murders were.

She is not a native to Hungary. She is a president from abroad. Wtf are you trying to that she is not? She is not from the West, but she is from abroad or since when are Slovakia and Hungary one country again? She can't conduct herselves with foreign populations the same as with the Slovak one and expect that it will have the same results. It will not, she will just come off as arrogant and preachy as I said.

&gt; She's more experienced and knowledgeable than you realize. Until then, you Czechs will continue to elect people like Zeman.

I did not say that she has no knowledge, I just said that she is inexperienced as a politician. I never voted for Zeman in any elections, but he was elected in fair democratic election and a part of democracy is to respect the choices of other members of the society that do not think the same like you. With people like you, in ""our"" liberal camp, no wonder the polarization in the society is the way it is.

For one, the very peculiar proportions of the Duomo resulted in very small windows, which made the interior quite dark especially for a Gothic cathedral (which is supposed to have large windows that take up most of the surface area so that there can be as much light as possible going inside) and therefore meant that it needed artificial lighting even during the day. There should have been either fewer aisles or taller aisles and much taller nave in order to correct this.

Because of that proportion, it led to the very odd (in my opinion anyway) triangular facade with the mismatched Renaissance details.

A great majority of Canada's emissions come from:

- trying to prop up an economy by producing remarkably inefficient oil (seriously 8% of Canada's emissions are produced just getting that oil out of the ground, not even counting refining costs or the end result of burning the stuff)
  - in fact, Canada is so boneheadedly committed to this outdated and wasteful technology they are insisting on throwing absurd amounts of capital at it -- amounts of capital that would completely revolutionize renewable energy if invested there instead
- insisting on building and living in supremely inefficient housing stock, designed to intentionally shoot heat through gaps in walls and windows in the middle of winter in lieu of proper ventilation
- refusing to build a proper intermodal transport network and insisting on highways as the only solution to move goods

1214,"https://theconversation.com/uk-human-rights-act-is-at-risk-of-repeal-heres-why-it-should-be-protected-111368

&gt;There have long been attempts to “scrap” the Human Rights Act 1998, which incorporates the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) into UK law. But while none have gained traction to date, parliamentarians have recently raised concerns that the government could be wavering in its commitment to the act post-Brexit.
&gt;
&gt;The House of Lords’ EU justice sub-committee said in January that it was worried to see the government change the wording of the political declaration it agreed with the EU, which sketches out a non-binding vision for what the UK’s relationship with Europe will look like after Brexit. 
&gt;
&gt;In its draft form, the declaration said that the future relationship should incorporate the UK’s “commitment” to the convention. However, by the time the final version was published in November 2018, that had changed to a commitment to “respect the framework” of the convention.
&gt;
&gt;The committee wrote to the government for clarification and received a response from Edward Argar, the parliamentary under-secretary of state for justice, who stated that the government would not repeal or replace the act while Brexit is ongoing but that “it is right that we wait until the process of leaving the EU concludes before considering the matter further”.

1415,"&gt;President of Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky signed a decree allowing tourists to freely visit the Chernobyl alienation zone.

&gt;He announced this during a ceremony marking the completion of a new sarcophagus over the destroyed reactor of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. The protective structure was under construction for over twenty years. 

&gt;Zelensky announced that his decree “will be the beginning of the alienation zone’s transformation into a point of growth in new Ukraine”, and that it will “remove the prerequisites for corruption and ill-conceived restrictions”. According to the president, Chernobyl will now be “a symbol of freedom in new Ukraine – with investments and a future”.

&gt;The explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, located near the Ukrainian town of Pripyat’, happened on 26 April 1986. This resulted in a massive amount of radioactive material being ejected into the surrounding environment. More than 115 thousand people were permanently evacuated from a 30-kilometer zone around the power plant, which became known as the “alienation zone”.

&gt;* The disaster is considered to be the largest in the history of nuclear energy. Considerable regions of Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia were subjected to radioactive contamination. The exact death toll of the disaster’s immediate consequences is impossible to determine – the numbers range from several thousands to hundreds of thousands.

&gt;* In November 1986, Reactor 4, where the explosion occurred, was enclosed in a reinforced-concrete sarcophagus, which was intended to prevent further radioactive leakage. Construction of the new, current sarcophagus with a cost of $1.5 billion was financed by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and executed by the French company Novarka. In its message, the Delegation of the European Union to Ukraine states that “Ukraine will now be in charge of the operation and maintenance of the facility, and also the dismantling of the original shelter hastily built shortly after the accident”.

&gt;* The TV show “Chernobyl”, created by the American channel HBO and based on true events, premiered in May 2019. It took first place in IMDb’s user-rated list of 250 best TV shows of all time.

1460,"&gt; ""obviously a client state"" how so?

Because of what *you* wrote: the TRNC exists for the express purpose of representing Turkey's interests on the island. They are also entirely dependent on Turkey for their existence in trade, diplomacy, and for military defense.

&gt;where is your actual proof that place has no right to exist as a country?

Being a client state and being justified in existing are two different things but furthermore, no, they have no justification for existing, either morally or in international law. The existence of the TRNC is purely a product of Turkish aggression, both during the invasion and since (e.g. all of the deaths in the Green Zone have been Turkish Cypriots killing Greek Cypriots).

&gt;but it does not change the fact that country has every right to exist and be recognized

Because?

&gt;which is both eu and turkey has been trying their best to stop. in the end it only hurts the island.

This is really rich: so Turkey&amp;mdash;the ones who *founded* the TRNC and the only state that recognizes it&amp;mdash;is trying to *stop* the TRNC from being legitimized? How can you possibly think that? If they didn't want them to exist, they could cut them off tomorrow.

&gt; and objective about everything between greece and turkey. we were told to fix our problems with greece, but greece was never told the same when their aircraft invades our airspace just like we invade theirs. eu always were way more favorable to greece than us. and no, i do agree that turkey is the agressor. im just saying that at this point, it simply doesnt matter. turkey simply wont give up on that island unless someone comes with a military strong enough to take it. But if you wanna blame me by using ""whataboutism"" when it wasnt at all and call our military there as rapists, im pretty sure you are past the point of no return on this discussion.

If you refuse to believe that the Turks used rape as a weapon of war in Cyprus, then I feel sorry for you and your ability to believe nationalist propaganda. The settler/occupier population there violated international law, constitutional Cypriot law, ethics, and the bodies of (Greek) Cypriot women. They stole that land for their own use and were happy to move into someone else's home and take it over by force. How you rationalize that as different than the Golan Heights is something I can't understand.

You want objectivity, sure that's fine. Who was it that slaughtered Armenians? Assyrians? Pontic Greeks? Cypriot Greeks? Kurds? Between Ottomans and their gross empire, built off of thieving from other peoples and denying *them* their own homelands for centuries and a series of genocides and massacres across the 20th century into the time of the Republic of Turkey, whatever state it was in Asia Minor has been a bad actor in the Mediterranean. Cyprus is just another one of the several victims of their hubris and xenophobia.

It's fine to discuss whether or not Greece invaded someone's airspace or were justified in trying to have Thrace as a state or the war crimes Greek Cypriots committed in Limassol, etc. It's just not relevant to and certainly does not justify the gross aggression by Turkey on Cyprus and their continued intransigence toward having a peace deal, including the [TRNC government who flat out refused Kofi Annan's very generous offer](https://www.aljazeera.com/archive/2003/07/2008410123294632.html) which a [majority of Turkish Cypriots wanted](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2003/03/an-ally-we-re-better-off-without.html). The Greek Cypriot community has long ago gotten tired of this war of attrition and the Turkish Cypriot side (backed by Turkey itself) is a bad faith actor whose long-term ""president"" (actually a [war criminal](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/denktash-revelation-over-killings-causes-uproar-1.33023)) [freely admitted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1tUGnWqw2M) that Turkish Cypriots instigated violence under false pretenses and even joked about terrorism.

None of this is to say that there is something inherently violent and xenophobic about *Turks*&amp;mdash;the mass support for Hrant Dink after his assassination, for instance was truly moving. But between the Ottomans, Young Turks, Ataturk, the waves of military coups, the TRNC war criminal thug cabal, and now the creeping Islamo-fascist Erdogan, Turkish leadership for no less than 150 years has been grossly corrupt, violent, and repugnant.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/cbrp0e/turkey_rejects_claims_it_is_drilling_illegally/etk5dd6/,koavf,1562889316

1544,"&gt; Airbus had too much advantage from launch credits, Boeing from state tax relief

Boeing received tax breaks in one single state in the US. While every single plane Airbus has ever brought to market in its entire history, was 100% funded by interest-free loans by European governments in which only part of the loan was required to be repaid in the event the planes became profitable.

It's not equal or comparable. Airbus has been the benefit of far more government assistance than Boeing has. The vast majority of cases brought before the WTO have had Airbus in violation. Boeing has won all but 2 of the disputes. There have been something like 26 disputes ruled on by the WTO between Boeing and Airbus.

&gt; Airbus cleaned up its act

No it did not. 

Seriously, it is maddening how much bullshit propaganda people believe about this. 

First off, Airbus is pretty much a European government entity now. European governments own half of Airbus's stock. HALF of the companies market valuation is due to investment that comes directly from European governments.

Secondly, Airbus has NOT honored the rulings of the WTO on launch aid. In 2016 the WTO confirmed the European governments not only failed to meet the compliance deadline to remedy $17 billion worth of past subsidies provided to Airbus, but that an additional $5 billion in illegal launch aid has since been provided to support the A350. The EU appealed that ruling. The WTO rejected the appeal in 2018.

We're talking about very large amounts of money given directly to Airbus by government entities in Europe.

""This morning, a 19-year-old asylum seeker rioted in front of a building of the Donauwörth anchor center in Sternschanzenstraße. According to the police, the young man smashed the front and rear windows of parked cars of the employees with a branch as thick as an arm and climbed onto the bonnets of two cars. The damage amounts to approximately 50,000 euros. The Donauwörth police arrested the 19-year-old. They noticed that, according to initial findings, he was actually housed in a branch in the Augsburg district. The officers are currently investigating the background to his crime. **When he was arrested, he gave only confused and incoherent information about himself and was therefore first admitted to the Donauwörth hospital for medical examination.** ""

1793,"&gt; I don't think they'll grant that long of an extension

The EU is not gonna let UK derail our agenda anymore. Not being firm, either with the terms of the agreement or the extensions, would weaken EU irremediably. That is why it's either gonna be for the full 5 years or no extension (automatic exit without a deal). At that point it will be about who loses more from a no-deal, and who loses more from giving in too much. 

 &gt;The EU won't let Brexit go into a no-deal scenario unless that's very clearly UK's decision or there's literally no other choice.

I agree but negotiating and giving in too much would weaken EU so it has to be firm. Arriving to the 31 without a deal wouldn't be because EU chose so, even if UK doesn't want it either, it's simply the default outcome. It's not EU's responsibility ""letting"" UK do anything. So if the EU says, ""stay for 5 years or leave now"", not wanting to stay for 5 years and choosing no-deal would be UK's decision. This is obvious as it happened twice already, it's just that this time the extension would be longer, and take-it-or-leave-it the full 5 years. It also allows both parties to save face, EU by not giving in and setting conditions, and UK by at least temporarily cancelling Brexit without revoking or having a second referendum.",Earth,/r/europe/comments/cbv5s9/likely_new_eu_chief_signals_she_will_not_reopen/etirvq9/,kaxobixo,1562858427

On Wednesday, Trump ordered an investigation into France's planned ""digital tax"" on tech companies. The 3% tax would apply to the French revenues of roughly 30 major companies, mostly from the U.S.

""France is sovereign, and France decides its own tax rules. And this will continue to be the case,"" France's Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said in a statement.

He added the U.S. and France could find agreements, rather than using threats, to reach a deal on the ""fair taxation"" of internet giants.

Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said the U.S. will investigate whether the French tax ""is discriminatory or unreasonable and burdens or restricts United States commerce."" 

The investigation could lead to the U.S. imposing tariffs or trade restrictions on French goods, potentially escalating the global fight over trade.

The investigation could lead to the U.S. imposing tariffs or trade restrictions on French goods, potentially escalating the global fight over trade.

Lighthizer added the U.S. will continue to support efforts by the Organization for Economic Development (OECD) to reach a multilateral agreement on taxes in the digital economy. The OECD has said it won't come to a conclusion on a so-called digital tax until 2020.

France forged ahead with its own version of a digital tax earlier this year. The tax would apply to companies that generate worldwide revenues on their digital services of at least 750 million euros ($845 million), with 25 million euros ($28 million) from within France. Le Maire has said the tax would raise up to 500 million euros ($565 million) per year.

In a statement, Amazon said the French tax is ""poorly constructed"" and ""discriminatory,"" adding it will cause ""significant harm to American and French consumers alike.""

1960,"I’ll list a few:

- The Conservatives decided to move forward with the Brexit process without first understanding why people voted for it and whether people realised what they were voting for. The fact that the process hasn’t gone in a way that anyone expected means that, by definition, no one knew what they were voting for, including Remain voters. That’s incompetence. 

- They triggered Article 50 without a clear set of agreed guidelines set out by Parliament, meaning that when May came back with a deal it was not agreed by Parliament. That’s incompetence. 

- They triggered Article 50 with a margin of only 4% of the electorate who actually voted. That was never going to be a good idea. That’s incompetence. 

- Brexiteers are now arguing for a hard Brexit and are stating that’s what the 17.4 million voted for, despite it literally being an outcome before the referendum that everyone generally agreed would be a bad idea. That’s a lie. 

- Many Brexit supporters seem to be happy to move forward with a Hard Brexit even though there are clear indicators that Scotland would likely leave the UK, damaging Scotland and the remainder of the UK in the process. That seems to be cutting off one’s nose to spite one’s face, based on English Nationalism perhaps. 

- There is lots of anti-EU information being spread about such as the Lisbon Treaty allegedly meaning the UK will be forced to adopt the Euro. That’s propaganda. 

- Both remaining Tory leadership candidates are stating that a deal with the EU can be reached by the end of October despite clear indications from the EU that they are not open for further negotiations. That’s incompetence. 

- Many Brexiteers are arguing that any outcome of the EU enforcing their border in Ireland after a Hard Brexit would be the fault of the EU. That’s propaganda. 

- Many Brexiteers arguing for a Hard Brexit are convinced that the UK would survive perfectly well outside of the EU trading block. They seem not to realise that businesses in the EU are only obligated to trade with other EU countries and will go elsewhere for their products and services. That’s delusional.

2119,"Thanks for that post mate, I've been thinking about this for years.
Also I see there are some battles going down in the comments so I want to correct some misconceptions. 
1. This ""joke democracy"" insults me, but I can understand the antidemocratic sentiment in China. 
It was a functioning democracy, a few hundred years ahead of its time, one of the things we should be proud of the most as a country. And it being bad corrupt ineffective and the main reason for the fall the Commonwealth is a myth. The reasons have more to do with economy, in short
-lots of wars destroying the economy
-Polish economy depending heavily on grain exports, lots of wars and destruction of cities that followed them strengthened this dependency
-Russia gains access to Baltic Sea, Russian grain is cheaper than Polish, you see where it goes
-decentralised power structure didn't allow to create a big modern army where infantry has to be trained for a few years in the same standard.
2. This sounds like people treating krautchan jokes seriously. There was only one time in modern history when Poland was the aggressor against Russia, 400 years ago and she won. And the loss of independence to Russia happened exactly two times, partitions and WWII, in either of them there were more factors then just Russia vs Poland.
3. Poland has a long history of diplomatic relations with Japan even preceeding Russo-Japanese war. Japan was seen as a potential ally against Russia and vice versa, it didn't turn out this way because of Nazi-Japanese alliance but there was a successful intelligence cooperation throughout WWII. Polish spies with the help of Japan took actions against Russia and Germany even though Poland was formally at war with Japan and Japan was formally an ally of Germany. Politics is complicated like that.
4. Poland never received any compensation from Germany and doesn't have any official claims for it, I don't really understand the reasoning behind this point.",Poland,/r/europe/comments/cbgd61/chinas_stereotypes_of_europe/eti3aer/,smutnysyn,1562837172

2137,"&gt; They aren't been taken away by the hand

I agree.

&gt; they are reaching out beyond us because they think we're holding them back

I disagree.

We have polls.  According to what I've seen, the top British concerns in the Brexit referendum were:

* Immigration

* Sovereignty

(There may be other items that just haven't been slapped on a poll, but those are the top ones I've seen listed.)

I have also seen some people theorize due to correlation with education that a factor may be concern over job prospects due to immigration.

We know that upset and UKIP support surged after intra-EU migration was much higher than the British government had predicted.

This is not particularly coordinated.  It is not unusual -- the US has even seen the immigration upset during *internal* migrations.

One thing that I am pretty sure of is that it does not represent some sort of broad, cross-United-Kingdom unspoken aim to adjust geopolitics.  In fact, I'd say that one of the things that personally I found very surprising was how little interest I saw in places like /r/ukpolitics in the geopolitics of the matter during the referendum.  Rather, it was reduced to very much popular domestic political issues, like the NHS (will more money be available/will migrants overload it), and government-subsidized services (will more money be available/will EU-mandated spending stop).  The main long-term point I've seen people on /r/ukpolitics arguing about EU or US relationships over comes from ""will it move domestic politics to the left or right"".

I had a fairly-long comment on /r/ukpolitics once where I brought up the possibilities of various partnerships that the UK might form and long-term demographics, population movement, global influence, and how I thought that Brexit might impact it and it did not generate discussion.

I'd say that Brexit was primarily due to:

* Poorly marketing the EU over the long term.  British approval of the EU was never terribly high after Maastricht.  That *alone* might not have caused it, but the EU was never in safe territory after that, and there was two decades between that and the referendum during which opinions might have been altered.

* Poorly-estimating either the scale of migration within the EU or the political backlash.  UKIP started its surge after Blair became one of three EU members not to use the immigration brake.

Yea, we shouldn't imitate the US or India when it comes to the age of criminal responsibility, like we shouldn't imitate Nigeria when it comes to women's rights.

&gt; Doesnt change the fact, that them and their families need to be investigated.

Sure, and you think they aren't being investigated?

&gt; Are you even familiar with german law? 

I know, just from reading this news article that the liability lies with their legal guardians, and that family court and the welfare office are now responsible for the boys. Furthermore, one of the boys was immediately arrested.

&gt; Underaged people dont get the same sentences as adults. No one is asking to throw them in prison. In this current situation, their conviction would have made them be able to get the help they need in a psychiatry, because they would be forced to attend their therapy.

If they get convicted by a normal court for rape and battery, I doubt that's whats going to happen. This is why they have special courts for this.

&gt;  But now their parent are covering them, making them unable to understand their wrongdoings and attend therapy. And in the meantime, while the state can try to strip the parents parental rights, the kids can a) commit more crimes and b) have a trauma by not being allowed to see their parrents again.

Here's an example of a WTO dispute from a few years back.

Some years back, the US passed a law against clove cigarettes being sold in the US; the stated intent was to prohibit flavored cigarettes, which targetted children.  Indonesia took issue with the fact that the US passed a law against clove cigarettes (which Indonesia exports to the US), but not menthol cigarettes (which Indonesia does not export to the US).  Their argument was that the US's justification of a health-and-safety basis could not be valid unless the US also prohibited menthol cigarettes.

2473,"The Srebrenica genocide was the July 1995 massacre\[8\] of more than 8,000 Bosniaks, mainly men and boys, in and around the town of Srebrenica during the Bosnian War.

The killings were perpetrated by units of the Bosnian Serb Army of Republika Srpska (VRS) under the command of Ratko Mladić. The Scorpions, a paramilitary unit from Serbia, who had been part of the Serbian Interior Ministry until 1991, also participated in the massacre. In April 1993 the United Nations (UN) had declared the besieged enclave of Srebrenica—in the Drina Valley of northeastern Bosnia—a ""safe area"" under UN protection. However, the UN failed to both demilitarise the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH) within Srebrenica and force the withdrawal of the VRS surrounding Srebrenica. UNPROFOR's 370 Dutchbat soldiers in Srebrenica did not prevent the town's capture by the VRS—nor the subsequent massacre.

In 2004, in a unanimous ruling on the case of Prosecutor v. Krstić, the Appeals Chamber of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), located in The Hague, ruled that the massacre of the enclave's male inhabitants constituted genocide, a crime under international law.\[17\] The ruling was also upheld by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in 2007. The forcible transfer and abuse, of between 25,000 and 30,000 Bosniak women, children and elderly which accompanied the massacre was found to constitute genocide, when accompanied with the killings and separation of the men.

In 2005, Kofi Annan, then Secretary-General of the United Nations described the mass murder as the worst crime on European soil since the Second World War, and in a message to the tenth anniversary commemoration of the massacre, he wrote that, while blame lay ""first and foremost with those who planned and carried out the massacre and those who assisted and harboured them"", the UN had ""made serious errors of judgement, rooted in a philosophy of impartiality"", describing Srebrenica as a tragedy that would haunt the history of the UN forever.

In 2006, in the Bosnian Genocide case held before the International Court of Justice, Serbia and Montenegro was cleared of direct responsibility for, or complicity in, the massacre, but was found responsible for not doing enough to prevent the genocide and not prosecuting those responsible, in breach of the Genocide Convention. The Preliminary List of People Missing or Killed in Srebrenica compiled by the Bosnian Federal Commission of Missing Persons contains 8,373 names. As of July 2012, 6,838 genocide victims have been identified through DNA analysis of body parts recovered from mass graves; as of July 2013, 6,610 victims have been buried at the Memorial Centre of Potočari.

In April 2013, Serbian President Tomislav Nikolić officially apologised for the massacre, although he stopped short of calling it genocide. In 2013 and 2014, the Netherlands was found liable in its own supreme court and in the Hague district court of failing in its duty to prevent more than 300 of the deaths.

On 8 July 2015, Russia, at the request of the Republika Srpska and Serbia, vetoed a UN resolution condemning the Srebrenica massacre as genocide. Serbia called the resolution ""anti-Serb"", while European and U.S. governments affirmed that the crimes were genocide. On 9 July 2015, both the European Parliament (EP) and the U.S. Congress adopted resolutions reaffirming the description of the crime as genocide.

On 22 November 2017, Ratko Mladić was convicted of various crimes at the United Nations' tribunal, including genocide for his role at Srebrenica. He was sentenced to life imprisonment. The judgement is currently under appeal.

On 24 March 2016, Radovan Karadžić, the former president of the Republic of Srpska was found guilty of the genocide in Srebrenica, war crimes, and crimes against humanity, 10 of the 11 charges in total, and sentenced to 40 years' imprisonment. On 22 July 2016 he filed an appeal against his conviction. The appeal was rejected on 20 March 2019, and the sentence was increased to life imprisonment.

2534,"If Ireland was given special status that would be an incentive for both the UK and the EU to strike a deal because they would not want that situation for long due to the potential to create an economic zone that has both markets available, it would sap business from the UK and the EU don’t like special statuses in the single market. And as a result there is no border down the Irish Sea, no border in Ireland, and I’m sure the Irish economy would boom under such arrangements.

If there was a no deal, this would likely be the situation anyway because I don’t see Ireland or the UK building a border on Ireland or in the Irish Sea.  

In my opinion though there needs to be a new cross country report and plan created by Irish, British and EU civil servants about building a technological border and how long it would it take to set up, the costs, the cross-country teams, the infrastructure. Maybe then we can get clarity if it’s possible on such a scale, will it be phased out etc. Maybe during this period we can just enter the transition period and finally start to agree a trade deal and new relationship. I think we need to just ditch the withdrawal agreement and just enter the transition period with the special economic status given to Ireland as the new backstop. Northern Ireland won’t be pleased but it could get support in the commons without the DUP, anyway the DUP must be able to see past Ideology and realise that the joint markets could revitalise their failing economy and its better than the other alternative of ceding the UK market to the EU in one of our territories.

Also worth nothing there is no customs differentiation between the EU and UK at this time, so technically there won’t need to be a border because UK goods don’t currently differ from EU goods.

2656,"&gt;Dividing on religion makes no sense at all. 

The first major delineation of Europe after the split of the Roman Empire was the Great Schism, a religious divide. Then the Reformation and Ottoman Islamization further split those two halves. Religion isn't just about theology, its about the culture that and traditions it shapes over time and the differences it produces.

&gt;I'd say Greece is entirely (bar the islands) Balkan. I mean, it's the literal tip of the peninsula. Having it's tip be separate doesn't make much sense to me.

I have considered this but then I also have to reconcile Greece's Mediterranean cultural similarities that are quite akin to the Italo-Iberian Mediterranean culture that characterizes Southern Europe and have been for quite a while, so grouping off the most Mediterranean part seems like a good compromise, especially since Greece's (partial) association with Southern Europe isn't even otherwise contested.

&gt;But they're way too east. Or north. Simple as that. Poland is also a mix between central and east IMO and can go into either or be split, so Lithuania, which also has influence from it's northern neighbors plus more Russian influence certainly isn't central.

The map uses primarily historical and cultural criteria to regionalize, not geographic. Non-Western European Catholics thus go into Central or Southern since these associations go back centuries and are pretty well established.

&gt;But historically you also have Yugoslavia, as well as the Turks pushing further north. 

Yugoslavia is barely 70 years of common history, there is 1000+ years of earlier separated development to consider.

&gt;Balkan, if not geographical, should be cultural, and by that it certainly extends further than 19th century Ottoman Europe. 

Sure but since Balkan culture is characterized primarily by its Greco-Byzantine heritage, Orthodox/Islamic tradition and long-term association with the Ottoman Empire you can't really extend this further west without creating all manner of historical and cultural contradictions, it would get very messy very fast.

&gt;Also, in the 19th century Serbia and Greece, while smaller, did break off, so what, those parts don't count?

As what?

&gt;But you have the same in Vojvodina. 

Again, due to the population shifts of the past 100 years and the ebbing away of the Catholic Central European population that was once settled there certain updates historical borders must be applied. Transylvania is not included in Central Europe for the same reason.

&gt;Either way, while culturally different, it's still similar to the rest of Croatia, and with, the rest of the ex-Yu. Plus the famed Balkan mentality is as present as elsewhere.

I guess that is in the eye of the beholder but for the purposes of this project I have to take historical and cultural divisions into account and they were clearly defined prior to the formation of Yugoslavia i.e. Catholic vs Orthodox, Austrian Empire vs Ottoman Empire, Latin alphabet vs Cyrillic alphabet.....

Mentality wasn't considered as a valuable metric since it can shift from generation to generation, Communist rule warped the minds of half of Europe in just a few decades.

&gt;70 years of Yugoslavia, plus some before that where they were culturally moving themselves towards us and the Croats. The culture, while more similar to Austria, is still quite similar to us in the south, plus the same language and all, plus being mostly south of the Sava.

Slovenia and Croatia developed under different religious and cultural influences for 1000 years prior to the formation of Yugoslavia and this has to be taken into consideration when producing a map based on historical and cultural criteria.

&gt;Or Eastern = far enough east. Northern = far enough north. Lithuania fits, combine some northern and Russian influence and it fits.

Again, geographic criteria isn't highly considered in this project, (religious) history and culture are. If Lithuania was majority Lutheran they'd fit in perfectly with Estonia and Latvia in Lutheran Northern Europe.

As for your other questions: Romanians aren't really assimilated, but I'd say we are more so than Hungarians. While you can find Hungarians in Ukraine that barely speak any Ukrainian/Russian, you can hardly find such Romanians or they are very isolated communities. I barely speak any Ukrainian, but I do speak Russian. I also left Ukraine when I was around 14 to live in Romania and back then Ukrainians had no issue speaking Russian, so not much focus was put on the Ukrainian language. As for the rights Romanians have...well, when I was a kid, the situation was just so miserable in Ukraine after the collapse of the USSR that no one really bothered with this, people cared more about making ends meet at the end of the month. After I left and Ukraine's economy started to be better, I know the Romanian community started to be more visible, they had/have many cultural events in Cernauti. Ukrainians treat Romanians mostly ok, but once in a while you can find some crazy ass that will either call you a gypsy or a genocidal maniac that killed Ukrainians alongside the Nazis in WW2, depends on the person. Since 2014, the situation kinda went to shit in many aspects. I know many of my friends and even relatives were called on duty to fight in eastern Ukraine, so many Romanians started to leave Ukraine and get the Romanian citizenship because obviously, they don't wanna die defending the lands of a foreign country. 

As for cooperation between us and Hungarians...can't say much about it since our communities aren't really much in contact with one another. I think there wouldn't be many issues since Hungarians don't mind Northern Bucovina belonging to Romania or not, just like we don't mind their part of Ukraine belonging to Hungary. I don't know much about the Polish minority either of Ukraine, never met any of them.

He also stated: „if they do it with 12 they clearly won’t do any better in life without hard punishment.“

I'm also not sure who you are referring to as current system. Current German system isn't the best, but there is no such a thing as 'making life worse for brown people', and sexual assaulters do go to social-therapeutic prisons with higher amount of psychologs and social-workers, and ones under 18, and sometimes even up to mid-20s go to specific prisons that are trying better for rehabilitation and resocialisation. I don't know about existence of private prisons in Germany either. Are you talking about the US?

I also can't really see how arguing about bettering social conditions, tackling poverty and rehabilitation somehow means 'let's not punish people with prison sentences'.

3066,"&gt; By what logic is Slavonia central but Vojvodina south-eastern?

Current population, basically. Central Europe is correlated with a traditionally Catholic populace, Vojvodina is now majority non-Catholic. Its also why I placed Kaliningrad into a transitory zone from Central to Eastern since its populace is now majority Eastern Orthodox Russian, at a certain point it will shift to purely Eastern Europe.

&gt;And Dalmatia is southern but Montenegro's coast which is the same isn't? 

Dalmatia was under centuries of Italo-Venetian cultural/linguistic influence and the population is traditionally Catholic. 

&gt;And splitting Greece like that? 

Greece was originally entirely in Southern Europe because of more modern perceptions but then I realized that divorcing it entirely from the Balkans was historically and culturally inconsistent so I returned the continental part back, it was already split like that [in the 19th century.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Hellenic_Republic)

&gt;Additionally how on Earth is Lithuania central?

They're traditionally Catholics as opposed to the Lutheran Estonians and Latvians and they were historically associated with Poland, a canonical CE country.

&gt;For the Balkans, it's pretty simple. Below the Sava and Danube it's the Balkan (geographically), above it's central. 

I don't give the common geographic definition of the Balkans much validity since the whole thing was borne of a German guy misunderstanding geography, I don't even consider Serbia to be *geographically* Balkan because the ""Balkan Peninsula"" isn't really a peninsula:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkans#Criticism_of_the_geographical_definition

So instead I use the traditional understanding of ""Balkans/Balkan Peninsula"" as as a synonym for (former) Turkish Europe that started with Greece and ended with Bosnia, since this was how it was reflected in pre-1918 cartography, its more a region with a specific historical continuity and cultural infusions.

&gt;But both Serbia and Croatia, while split, are Balkan countries, cause even above those rivers, the place is pretty Balkan. 

Serbia, sure, but northern Croatia has a different historical, cultural and religious pedigree that places it in Central Europe: traditionally Catholic but with a Protestant minority dating back to the Reformation, the majority of which is actually in Slavonia. Then there's the prolonged Germanic influence that gave rise to artefacts like [Agramer Deutsch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQclnonFTA4), the traditional use of the quasi-Slovene Kaykavian language in the NW, the textbook Habsburgian Gothic/Baroque architecture and vibe and of course the fact that it was never historically associated with the Balkans prior to the formation of Yugoslavia.

&gt;Slovenia's more debatable.

I fail to see how any aspect of Slovenia could be characterized as Balkan, historically and culturally speaking. And again, like Croatia, as far as cartographers were concerned Slovenia only became associated with the Balkans after the formation of Yugoslavia.

&gt;Lithuania is also pretty much eastern, or maybe northern.

Eastern = traditionally Eastern Orthodox without direct Byzantine infusion. Northern = traditionally Lutheran with historic Norse/Germanic influences.",,/r/europe/comments/cbd27f/on_this_day_nikola_tesla_was_born_the/etflxnw/,DazzaVonHabsburg,1562772623

The lie is that the Ukrainian army can protect their people. It can't.

Of course, you were facing an enemy that was inferior by every possible measure. That's not the case now, is it?

&gt;Only full-scale involvement of Russian army stopped us from completely liberating our land. So far.

The Russian intervention was very limited in scale.

&gt;Since then Russian fuckers even had to classify their army loses. They bury their soldiers killed on Donbass as some casual loses - with no military honor. As they deserve it.

That doesn't happen. The only Russians who get buried in Donbas are volunteers who came there on their own and they have nobody to ship them back.

Therefore, many of the agreements between trade unions and employers  organizations have a clause that the full wage is to be payed anyway by topping up the government payout.

3268,"&gt;overthrowing marionette Nazi-collaborating governments of the Baltic states 

This made me laugh out loud. Please provide some proof that the authoritarian governments of Baltic states pre-1939 were Nazi-collaborators? 

&gt;Some parts of the Russian Empire were ""occupied"" by Bolsheviks during the Civil War. Some escaped that fate and stayed independent for years, like Baltic states. Others, like Finland, stayed independent forever. 

Problem here is that Baltic states fought for their independence and won because of the circumstances. After that victory the entire ""reconquest"" of former Russian imperial provinces becomes invalid because Baltic states were equally independent states as the Soviet Union. From legal point of view Soviet Union signed recognition and non-aggression agreements with Baltic states.

Also please look up the definition of word ""liberation"". 

And another thing is that you are putting modern, nationalistic justifications of conquest upon history. In no time did Soviet Union back in 1940 claim that conquest of Baltic states was ""reconquest of imperial provinces"", nor it was viewed as such.

Also, as morality is not driven by genetics (exceptions like psychopaths apply, though it's the opposite way) but injected via culture, they may have very well thought that it wasn't wrong, in which case the parents are at fault for not educating their children right.

3398,"Well I am from europe belgium. So don't forget I look at this from a different perspective than the usa. Minors are not convicted here for there crimes, not like adults do since they are not considered to be responsible for their actions.

Look at it this way, a child soldier is brought up in africa, taken away from this parents at the age of 8, learned how to kill and rape, and aquired a taste for it. His parents are able to get him back at the age of 15 and flee to a western european country.

AT the age of 16 he rapes and kills his grandmother in a western country. In court he asked for forgiveness.

His parents can't forgive him, no one can but the justice system didn't convict him he did end up in a psychiatric hospital.

Now the question is is he responsible for his actions. Victims will pretty muchalways say yes, it's better to deal with such horror if you can blame someone.

But sadly it doens't work that way, kids are like spunges and they suck up everything around them and then give it back. It's only later in life as an adult they actually realize the consequences.

Saying they are responsible for their actions is not going to change anything, they still think they are going to get away with it, or do it in a psychotic frenzy.

Because that's what the result of this upbringing is, either they turn into psychopaths, or it results in psychotic behaviour. 

If you bring up kids in a situation where certain behaviour is normal, you just cannot get it out that easily and you can't held them responsible like you do with adults, because they don't realize what they're doing to the full extent like adults do.

IF you teach kids to do certain things, or give them the idea that certain things are ok , it becomes a part of their subconcious, and it will become an impuls, and the undeveloped brain will have a hard time handling that when unsupervised.

3441,"&gt;&gt; judges have only 1 thing to keep in mind, that is the law itself.
&gt;
&gt;...and? The law is interpreted. Sometimes quite differently by different lawyers. Where is the guarantee that judges are not biased in their interpretation?
&gt;

that's the politician's job, to make clear laws, if judges can apply more then one interpretation, the politician failed.

this does not grant politician the right to adjust verdicts.

&gt;&gt;  to enact the laws
&gt;
&gt;It is not their role. They should stick to the law and the law should leave very little room for interpretation, but unfortunately it is difficult to create such a law.

thats to bad for the politician, they do get payed enough to think about it. the judge applies, the politician makes the rules, they do not apply them.

&gt;I do not know how it is in the world, but in Poland lawyers are over-represented in the legislative authorities and create laws that are convenient for them, i.e. laws that leave a wide scope for interpretation and judges are gods of the life and death of others. 

thats what you get when you vote in lawyers, thats in your people, not the judges.

&gt;Such a situation gives too much power to lawyers and destroys democracy. No democratic state should tolerate this because it undermines the foundations of its functioning. 
&gt;

and so those politician lawyers should also be given the ability to tell judges what to declare?

&gt;&gt; the law becomes just a piece of paper.
&gt;
&gt;..if it is vague and can be interpreted in any way judges find useful. It is sick.
&gt;

it is, and the people who wrote it are to blame for this, not the judges.

&gt;&gt; he cannot ignore the law
&gt;
&gt;In theory, in practice they always can find way to interpret it to push their agenda. In practice they are able to interpret them in a completely different manner depending on who is judged. Supporting people with the same views and oppressing opponents.
&gt;

if the law is poorly written by politicians, then yes, hold the politician accountable for this.

&gt;&gt; if he does so he'll lose his job as a judge
&gt;
&gt;Not in Poland and not in any country which has judges with the same bias backing each other. There is simply no way to lose job as long as you are opportunist and prop official line.
&gt;

it can be hard, but if you can prove it, unavoidable. if the law is to unclear to create this situation, the politician who made that law is to blame.

&gt;&gt;  if this changes, politicians will pressure judges to enact their views without formally changing laws,
&gt;
&gt;I'm sorry but you are not logical (to put it mildly). Any politicans with ability to pressure judges can change the law, too.  It is safer, more convenient for politicians to change law than pressure judges, it is their duty after all. 

changing a law puts your name on it, changing a verdict puts the judges name on it...

&gt;Only problem arise when judges resist new law and ignore it because they don't like it.

this is why you need different levels of judges, ""internal affairs"" sort, and very clear laws.

&gt;Politicians don't need control of judges in healthy situation because they can change the law (if they enjoy big enough majority). They need this control when judges simply break the rules, try to influence or interpret the law in a different way than the legislator intended. 

no, they need a clear and unavoidable system, not direct interference.

&gt;
&gt;&gt; now we can point at the politicians for making crappy laws and hold them responsible for their crappy work
&gt;
&gt;Yes, we should. One small detail, many legislators are lawyers... It looks almost as if making bad laws is not a mistake, but an intentional action.

vote for lawyers, get stupid laws.

3690,"Sounds like a lack of sex education on your part, to be honest. Kids in the UK are briefed on it when they're 10/11 so that they know how babies are made and the signs of puberty, so that they should, in theory, recognise it and be able to go to an adult for help. I know lots of people started the whole fascination with losing their virginity around 12/13 too and it wasn't uncommon for people to lose it by 14/15.

Still, that does not excuse these boys. Even with absolutely minimal sex education, it's very apparent at a young age that forcing somebody to do something is not a normal thing to do or think about.

3691,"That's why we allow 12 year olds to drink alcohol, watch/play whatever they want and give their consent for sex.

This is in fact a very nuanced discussion. A 12 year old kinda knows what's right or wrong but that isn't enough. A lot are still not competent applying these rules, they lack the feel for consequences. Not only for themselves but the people around them.

They know it is false but could still be manipulated to view rape just like other more minor crimes and not the abomination it is. Or the other way around think they have to give in on the peer pressure at any cost.
I think that we all agree that this is the case at some point so where do we draw the line? At 14? 12? Why not at 10 or even 8 than?

If I think of myself I was still a very naive and dumb child at 11/12. I was way more a child than I was a teenager. I never did anything criminal, but it's not my point that most of us wouldn't have. I think that you shouldn't imprison a child that still has no idea what the consequences of its actions even are.

3696,"My problem is that in the US we can charge children as young as 12 as adults with felonies. Claiming that they understood right from wrong and they knew and accepted the consequences for their actions. The law also says that those same kids are incapable of understanding and making a decision when it comes to sexual activity. 

Example: 14 year old girl steals a car and gets arrested. She is charged with a felony, convicted, and spends a year in jail and has a permanent criminal record. She gets out of jail at 15 and has a boyfriend who just turned 18. They have sex and her parents find out and call the police. The boyfriend is arrested for felony statutory rape because the state says she isn't old enough or mature enough to make the decision to have sex. 

The state determined that at 14 she was old enough and mentally mature enough to be charged with felony auto theft but a year later she was too young and mentally immature to decide what she did with her own body and who she did it with. 

I am in no way advocating sex with 14 or 15 year olds. Im trying to illustrate that we can't have contradictory laws claiming that kids as young as 12 are mature enough to be charged as adults with felonies but aren't mature enough to understand the consequences of having sex. 

In the US some states age of consent is 16 and some are 18. If the law says that is when they are mature enough to make a decision about sex and comprehend the consequences of sexual activity then that should be the minimum age for charging someone as an adult. 

If we say 18 is the age under the law someone is considered an adult then any crimes before they are 18 should be juvenile charges. It shouldn't be up to prosecutors. If someone is old enough to be charged as an adult with a crime they should be considered a full adult at whatever age the state determines that is. There should be an agreement in all the laws about when a person is considered an adult. We can't have different standards for different situations.

*sight* Yes, because much of that continent is still stuck at pre-industrial era, with exception of southern tip of Africa, southern Nigeria and few other places south of Horn.

If investment and economical rise that goes concurrent with rise of African population actually achieves its aim, those GHG will not explode, they will go nuclear. If industrial rise of China with roughly 2 net rate of children per woman and its associated GHG is any template to use, what will happen in Africa will put India to such a shame that we can just as well ritually sacrifice all them polar bears.

Alternative is that industrialization in Africa will not happen and rampant poverty will remain, just with over twice the population that is there today so .... yay?

My calculations might be a bit off - so please correct me if I err - but 17 thousand seems to represent about 2.8% (that's two point eight percent, i.e. just shy of 3%).

My understanding is that 3% is considerably less than 1/2, or 50%.

Russia seems to be either fourth or fifth in the world in terms of active military personel (after China, India, the USA), with over 1 million soldiers in total. By contrast, Ukraine's armed forces measure about 200,000 (that's two hundred thousand) active personel. [(Source)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_number_of_military_and_paramilitary_personnel)

200k is about a fifth (that's 1/5) of 1 million, so considerably less.

3959,"&gt;The UK unilaterally guaranteed the rights of EU citizens in the UK - no matter the deal with the EU - back in 2016. The EU has yet to reciprocate. How this makes the UK 'not care about EU citizens rights' is truly master-level propaganda by the EU. 

&amp;#x200B;

The UK didn't unilaterally guarantee anything, it merely proposed reciprocal rights for citizens in the EU and the UK. This wasn't accepted, because at that time the UK didn't even invoke the Art. 50 yet. When we are talking about citizen rights in 2019, this happens in the frame of a possible deal, which the UK isn't even sure it wants.

Meanwhile, the last decade was marked by aggressive, offensive and xenophobic articles in the British media, accusing foreigners of draining the welfare system, committing crimes and taking the jobs out of the hands of the hard-working British people. I leave to you to decide what kind of climate this creates towards EU citizens from Eastern or Southern Europe, who follow the rules and happen to live in the UK. But let me just point out that there is not one newspaper in continental Europe which targets the British expats as source of increased criminality.  


&gt;everything you think you know about the US/UK population's is largely the result of english-speaking media (dominated by Remainer-types), movies, speaking English, and our incredible national PR machines. 

&amp;#x200B;

If that was true, it would mean that the conservative/right-wing movement doesn't have its media or PR. Yet both times - during Brexit and Trump's victory in the US election, people were repeating the populist statements the parties fed them with. As it came out, hardly any of those premises had any factual basis. My issue is not with people being left or right, liberal or conservative. I am neither of those things and I can agree or agree to disagree with anything. But what really bothers me is that in the age of internet, when information is ridiculously easily accessible, people are still influenced by populism and then spend 2 years wondering why things are not happening the way they expected them to happen.

3973,"&gt; Regardless Tokyo see's more tourists per year than Paris does.

No, and that's not even close. 

&gt; As I mentioned above tourism alone (that is tourist oriented businesses, so not Minami coming for a doughnut in the evening) brings in 77 billion euros compared to Paris where it's 13 billion euros.

Here is the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) list of the countries with the most revenues from tourism in 2017 in billions of € :

USA: 205,4

Spain: 56,5

Thailand: 44,9

China: 45

France: 44,9

[Full report here.](https://www.e-unwto.org/doi/pdf/10.18111/9789284419050) Japan doesn't even make the top 10. 

&gt; The Japanese domestic overnight travel and day trip solely contributes more than 82% of the total contribution to the tourist income, bearing in mind this paper has a higher reported Tourism income of 178 billion euros, however that sentence may refer to the income nationally. (http://cf.cdn.unwto.org/sites/all/files/docpdf/tokyocasestudy.pdf)

So that includes Shinzo who takes a suburban train and eats some ramen in Shibuya before taking back his train home. All of that gets included which gives an absurd number that doesn't make any sense which is exactly why the UNWTO doesn't use this methodology when they give their annual report on tourism where Japan and Tokyo don't come even close to Paris and France.

I genuinely don't understand why you're trying to argue Tokyo gets more tourists than Paris or London, this is such a ludicrous claim even Japanese wouldn't make.",Moody Parisian,/r/europe/comments/caokte/first_time_in_paris_this_city_actually_lives_up/etdjmax/,Nico2845,1562708108

We're just amused (especially here in Scandinavia where it, unlike in for example Russia, is unthinkable for two straight men to do any of this). But a bisexual person who's mainly into the opposite sex and has always thought s/he's only interested in the opposite sex will feel something, an arousement.

In fat letters on top it says:

Modern planes emit FAR less CO2 than old ones. The newest generation, like the A319neo, consume less than 2 liter of kerosene per passenger per 100km, on a typical flight of a 1000 miles (all-in). 

That's equivalent to 50 g CO2 per km per person.

That's a factor of 82.5% than the number you quote (which is WAY outdated).

It is much better than most cars with typical occupancy rates.

It is still about 3x that of trains. HOWEVER, infrastructure costs and related CO2 consumption is WAY lower for airplanes.

The issue is not that planes burn a lot of fuel per mile (they don't really anymore), the problem is that they can transport a human being an incredible amount of miles in a small amount of time.

The only way to solve that conundrum, is to make everyone travel less, and not by using a different transportation method (car, rail, ...)",,/r/europe/comments/cb2b07/france_will_introduce_ecotax_on_flights_out_of/etd7tbo/,KindMeal,1562700996

If you compare ""use of motorbike/death"", motorbike would get even better result. Who in it's right mind would say motorbike are safe? Why do you need helmet?

&gt;Vaccination is pretty much 99.9% safe, there are a few rare cases where people have reactions

The word you are looking for is anaphylaxis choc Mr. Expert and the rate is actually 1/100 000. So it happens every 99.9999%.

&gt;Most vaccines are long out of patent and make no money for labs

That is the most ignorant thing of the post. [Here is a Video of the CEO of GSK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuxpBJ9wNng) explaining how by buying the patent of the Hepatitis B then combining it with vaccine without patent, allowed them to fix the price they wanted for vaccine. A vaccine in France cost 110€ sponsored at 90% by the state. The price REMAINS PAID.

So you are just irrationally angry and turning to insults now? You have zero clue as to what Japanese society, culture and life is like. Japanese business trips and school trips are huge unlike anywhere else. In the Paris metropolitan area there are 12 million people meanwhile in the Tokyo metropolitan area there are 38 million. Tokyo is also attached to the greater Taiheiyou belt which is a Megalopolis consisting of 84 million people with a shinkansen line running down it. Japan has a greater connectivity through rail travel and Tokyo is a central destination. Tokyo is home not just to the government but also the emperor. The Sanno festival alone which attracts 2 million locals and tourists and that's just a single festival. Tokyo Disneyland see's 18 million visitors third only behind two parks in the USA. Tokyo Disneysea was the fastest park to hit 10 million visitors. Meanwhile Paris Disney receives 14 million and the studios park only receiving 5 million. More than 100,000 people attend the Shibuya cross alone for new years and Halloween. 20 Million people ride the Tokyo trains daily and a total of 13 billion people use the trains each year, twice the population of earth, meanwhile German trains only carry 10 million people a year. ([http://www.elsi.jp/en/blog/2015/11/blog1126.html](http://www.elsi.jp/en/blog/2015/11/blog1126.html))

Hope those numbers are good enough for you. 

The lesser known Senso-ji shrine get's 30 million annual visitors, just for extra reference Kyoto alone see's 53.6 million visitors a year without being the capital and only 4 million of those where foreign tourists. Tokyo also consists of 2 trillion of Japanese 4.5 trillion dollar GDP. while Paris is only worth 700 billion dollars. I don't quite think you understand what the city of Tokyo truly is.

All countries have unspoken rules. In Europe bringing your own drinks isn't something that is considered very correct.

In countries like Japan you would be allowed to treat the waiters like shit if you were Japanese, but as a European it's ok for the waiter to serve you last because it's a very racist country. In the US you're a villain if you don't leave a tip even if you're a poor student, but in most european countries they will understand that you just don't have this kind of money. 

In some countries and places it's very rude to ask for a change in a meak (like ""can I have this but without the salad?""). I rarely had problems with that in Europe.

Yes, europeans aren't the most polite people, but I do appreciate some honestly instead of east asian hypocrite mannerism or american overexcitment.

Who are you to say that?

&gt;that died with the Third Reich a long time ago.

What? The Third Reich did NOT respect ""ethnic clean countries"". Have you forgotten what they did to Eastern Europe?

&gt;They do not belong here? Why is that, exactly? Do the europeans not belong in the US, then? Or Africa? Or Australia? All those places have Europeans... Do Russians belong in the US? Or can they only be in slavic countries? Is Czechia even slavic anymore, as most of the population is more geneticaly german than slavic?

Yes, all Europeans should go back to Europe. America belongs to native Americans. Why do you hate native Americans so much?

&gt; Noone will blame anyone for having a strict immigration policy. That is an OK thing to do, but the selection process muist be open to every race and culture and you cannot ever refuse someone because of their race or culture. You should judge the individual, always. Never the group.

Again, we get to decide what we do. If we want to select people based on race then that's perfectly fine. I don't care about your opinion.

&gt;You are Belgian you said? Belgium is very pro EU and you obviously arent, you disagree with most Belgians. That is ok, that is your right.

4350,"&gt;You've just complained how Russians weren't interested in an Estonian cultural festival. Clearly it's not only about language.

I didn't complain about it. I just brought an example how so many Russians think that doing everything in Russian is ""being inclusive"", even though they could easily do it just in Estonian – the official language of the country, without losing their identity whatsoever.

&gt;It's as very interesting foreign language if spoken by a quarter of your population. Once again, look at Canada. French is not considered foreign there.

It's spoken by a quarter of the population because the country suffered from forced mass immigration during the recent occupation period. Still a foreign language.

&gt;Then add the fact that Estonia never kicked its illegal immigrants out, but actually legalized them in 1994. That's not how you treat an occupying force, I'm afraid. 

So you're saying is that there are only two real options – to treat Estonia as a fully biethnic / bilingual country or to just expel all Soviet-era migrants. Well, the latter is not happening because this is an EU member in 21st century, the former is not happening because it's basically engraved into Estonian constitution. So here we are.

&gt;If you lived in your isolated Tuva all your life and essentially share no traits with Russians, what even makes you local? If you lived in your isolated aul up in the Caucasus all your life and essentially share no traits with Russians, what even makes you local? 

These territories have been annexed by Russia, so of course they're Russian citizens. Those in the Baltics that feel Russian and connected to Russia have the ideal country to choose. 

&gt;Then said country tells you you don't belong and that you're an occupant that holds no allegiance to your birthplace (if I understand you right). 

I've not said that. I've said that Soviet-era migrants have been forced to go through an extra process to become locals. That they're not treated the same as those who lived here before USSR, yes, that's true, and for a reason. There's the legal point-of-view where they haven't immigrated under legal authority, and there's the social view of many of them being ultimately loyal to Soviet – or now – Russian authorities, caring little about the local tiny republic which they saw merely as a province of a bigger empire back then. The latter are supposed to accept being foreigners here or choose another country to live in, they are not considered locals *by default*.

&gt;Additionally, it's quite ironic, but Russian citizenship law does cover this exact situation. If what parents can be found are foreign or stateless and hold Russian residence permits, their Russian-born child is granted citizenship if they don't choose their origin country's one instead. It's a safeguard precisely against these kinds of situations, to be able to get rid of the problem in a single generation instead of perpetuating it.

Russia is the successor state of USSR, they have no legal grounds to do anything similar to what Baltics did. What is more, let's be honest, Russia is a gigantic country and vast majority of Soviet migrants were Russian-speaking. There are virtually no issues of loyalty or identity problems. Russia did not experience mass immigration to an extent where Russians became a minority in their own capital. Russians, in fact, can not relate to the problem whatsoever as they have been the ones to assimilate others. 

Just comparing statistics as simple as Russians in Estonia vs Estonians in Russia. The former is a story of skyrocketing during Soviet era, then a plunge in 1990s and stability afterwards. The latter is a story of spiking during Russian empire and then never-ending downspiral ever since commies came to power, that is more than a century of continous decline in a row. So let's just say that Estonians do not really feel Russia would be a great place for ethnic minorities. The story of other Finno-Ugric in Russia is not really much better either.

&gt;Then why not simply throw them out instead of making them second class residents? Now that's a double standard if I've ever seen one.

It was the ease of access to state services that did it, we don't have any extra support for illegal migrants, we just give full access to state services to their children, and we allow illegal workers to discount from their salary if they find work, start a process of legalization and have access to the wellfare state meanwhile, not all of it as you need to have I think two years of discounts to become legal and have full access.

&amp;#x200B;

Lets just stop the idea there is a special wellfare system to a minority with no accumulated wealth that cant vote. That is one step above pretending the lower income classes are living the good live out of some incredibly generous and plentiful imaginary wellfare subsidies. There are likely less then a handfull of countries in our continent that can have the generous wellfare to migrants stamp. and they can only be called generous because the huge wealth difference that exists between the richest countries in Europe and the rest. For us those subsidies are generous, but  we are still making 3 to low 4 digits salaries, paying almost a quarter of that in income tax, and having to make due with what is left.

&amp;#x200B;

another example, when a cruiser tank like Comet, which was faster, more reliable, more manoeuvrable, lighter, had a lower profile, similar armour (though slightly less effective due to not being sloped) and a better gun than Panther (probably the best German tank of the war) is faster and cheaper to produce, and able to take out anything you can deploy, you've already lost",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/capfio/neofascist_golden_dawn_party_crashes_out_of_greek/etc1jsu/,FieldMarshalFry,1562672012

No, we don't have most of those foods you mentioned and those that we do, were totally changed from their original form. Sarma here is made with pork and corba...you basically call corba every soup, for us there is a difference between soup and corba, so it's not really the same thing. The rest of them aren't typical for Romania. You can find them here for sure, but we do not call them typical in any way (burek here is associated with Serbia for some reason). The fact that Mozart wrote one piece influenced by Turkish music doesn't mean much, there was no Turkish composer that ever made it as big as Mozart has, despite the fact that the Ottomans weren't far behind Austria in terms of empires. That's my point, no one worth remembering in any form of art came out of the Ottoman empire in several centuries of it being a power in Europe, therefore backwater.

&amp;#x200B;

This is the Dacian clothing, before they got conquered by the Romans and they use something pretty similar to a fez. I'm not saying the Turks took it from them since they never met, but I'm saying it's an element that existed in the area for sure, long before the Ottomans came to Europe.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd say the Byzantines influenced you too, since your mosques are inspired by Byzantine churches in many cases, you made a Byzantine city your capital city etc etc. Also you mention how important religion is, but the Gagauz are Orthodox, not Muslims.

4761,"&gt;Most of the US Government don't even want this and if most of the US government doesn't want this then you can imagine the vast majority of the US public doesn't want any US troops going into Syria so if thats the case why in the world would Germany do anything? Not to mention Trump has attacked the German government.

I don’t know where you are getting your information from. Most of the US government is for US troops in Syria. US troops in Syria aren’t really fighting. They’re giving like background supper to the SDF Kurdish group. 


&gt;Germans need to recall that the US is very different than Germany.. everything is insanely divided. I often tell people (from my view this is how I see Americans anyway) is that an American redneck is far more likely to save the life of a Russian wearing a Soviet era uniform than he would for a liberal and visa versa. So it goes without saying that Americans dont want any conflict with Syria.

Obama put US troops in Syria. Obama didn’t want direct conflict with Assad. Trump increased US troops in Syria a bit. Trump doesn’t want direct conflict with Assad either. There is consensus on Syria. The US isn’t that divided, it’s not Belgium.





&gt;The crazy thing is I don't think Trump does either. Trump has been anti-War his entire life. He was a draft dodger, a coward of sorts in the eyes of his fellow countrymen but the powers that be I believe are forcing him to do so. I hate Trump so this isn't a ""Trump is a victim"" .. no he's the fucking president but I strongly believe he's a puppet president being played by the Russians and China via Russian proxy (yes, the Chinese even with Huawei / trade war crises.. will not even touch that topic) but also the war hawks in Washington.. they have lobbyist that represent some of the wealthiest private weapon manufacturers on the planet that need war to sell their weapons. The US Government is often happy to oblige. But I don't think Trump wants war. He absolutely does NOT need a war to win in 2020, in fact his approval ratings (mind boggling) are higher than they've ever been. I would argue that unlike most of these horrible leaders in our world, Donald J Trump is the only major bad leader that hates actual real war.


He doesn’t hate war. He is open to war in places like Venezuela. He’s against war with Iran because there is no point in war with Iran. Iran’s economy is currently collapsing right now without war. There’s no purpose in war with Iran.


The US can’t occupy Iran, it’s too big a country. War with Iran would bring lots of chaos just to destroy Iran, but Iran is already suffering right now anyway without the war. It’s just not logical to have conflict with Iran when it’s unnecessary.



&gt;With Iran, no other president would have rethought that, it would have been a Shock and Awe mini version and an estimated 200 dead is nothing for them but Trump pulled back.. I'm sure his puppet masters outside the US pulled the strings but I also think he just hates war as terrible as that man is, it is as of right now his only redeeming quality.

Trump never wanted to hit Iran in the first place. He’s being disingenuous to make himself look like a benevolent guy. 


To be clear, if Iran had killed American soldiers then Trump would have hit Iran. The reason the US didn’t attack iran was because all they did was shoot down a US unmanned drone. 

The Iranian government is afraid of war the US. The US government doesn’t want war with Iran. That’s why there’s peace. Iran is between a rock and hard place",,/r/europe/comments/cam4y4/syria_germany_rejects_us_demand_for_ground_troops/etblnrr/,Sandyhands,1562651215

4763," 

&gt;I don't know why it's so hard. There have been great efforts to promote ""good Islam"" over ""bad Islam"" in the UK with some success. There are, after all, many moderate Muslims that just want to get on in life living in a western nation.

Either your taboos (whose mad consequences you should latest have noticed in Rothenham!) blindfold you for reality or you have different Muslims than we do. The following article conveniently summarizes the failed efforts to promote progressive Islam in Germany and why they ended in disaster - and it is only the tip of the iceberg: \[*Check out the article ""Germany's Quest for Liberal Islam"" by Vijeta Uniyal, July 6, 2017. I had set a link to it but a stupid bot has then deleted my posting for no apparent reason.*\]  
 

&gt;Making ""German values"" antithetical to ""Islamic values"" and then inviting Muslims to co-inhabit your country seems like a the perfect way to set of powder keg of Islamophobia worse still that what we've experienced in the UK working class communities.

Probably so. But those values are written down in our Grundgesetz which was designed the way it is because of requirements imposed by the Allied Forces, and they are like divine laws for us. If Islamic values are antithetical to them, then they are not tolerable values.

&gt;Just to give you a recent example, in the context of a discussion of an Indian wedding in India, sitting amongst a group of allegedly progressive Germans, exactly the kind who presume that Britain is inherently more racist than Germany and longs for the days of empire, the first question asked was ""Was it an arranged marriage?"".

Having witnessed arranged marriages even in EU Greece with my very own eyes, I find this question legitimate. We are still aware that other cultures have traditions different from ours.

&gt;Many Germans seem to act as if Germany were the only civilised nation on earth by dint of their post-Nazi self-flagellation.

You nailed it. That's exactly the way it is. I flinch every time someone brings up an upper limit of accepting 200000 refugees per year and inevitably some Merkel Minion would respond, ""And what shall we tell the 200001st at the border?"" Good heavens, I'd tell him: ""Salzburg, Austria, which you have passed fifteen minutes ago, is a nice place to live, too! Last time I checked there were no bombs falling there."" But those Germans, they keep pretending that for non-Europeans, life worth living was possible only in Germany.

&gt;More accurately it might be said that Germany has writhed in self-pity and pointless guilt ...

Yes. But you wanted us that way. We have been conditioned by the Allied Forces to eternally writh in guilt, and now you complain that your plans have succeeded. (And everybody who doesn't is a Nazi, anyway.)

&gt;I know a hell of a lot of foreigners in Germany and I would say that most of them hold negative feelings towards German society to some degree on the basis that ethnicity, nationality, and culture seem to be so important to the ethnic Germans that it's hard to move past those things and ever feel like a simple member of society than a foreigner in Germany.

I feel the same way in my wife's country. And I accept it the way it is. Of course I will never become one of ""them"" - they are usually surprised enough that I understand what they are saying. No need to be over-sensitive here and go around accusing the whole neighbourhood of crypto-racism. You will only alienate the locals that way.

&gt;Brexit isn't going to completely alter societal norms, nor is it going to mean Britain ceases to be an ethnically diverse nation.

Well, you know, there is this German businessman living in Birmingham who has told me that ever since the Brexit vote, his front door and that of every other EU citizen in the road is frequently vandalised and even violently kicked apart ... We don't have this in Germany, you know.

&gt;If you explain Trump with the idea that Americans are just a bunch of racists, and Brexit with the idea that Britain is just a bunch of racists / imperialists

But that is exactly the whole point of the German narrative! Everybody who is not neoliberal, fervently pro-EU, green or at least marxist and willing to sacrifice his own identity in the name of Tolerance(TM) is automatically labelled ""Nazi"" by the Merkel Minions and their controlled press. Thus, all Trump voters are Nazis, all Brexiteers are Nazis, all Erdogan voters are Turk-Nazis, Hungarians, Poles, Austrians and Italians have always been Nazis in the first place, East Germans are Nazis and should forever have stayed locked away behind the Iron Curtain, even Slavoj Žižek is Nazi because he blasphemes against St Angela. And what remains of the once brilliant Light of Human Empathy (that's the biggest buzzword of the German narrative: Empathy for Everyone (Except for Whites) or Nazi!) is solely carried by those German captains boldly sailing up and down the Libyan coast to fill their ships with ""people in distress"" (for the rest of the world: ""illegal migrants""). Oh, and Greta Thunberg is sooooo great, it's a pity that she isn't German.

&gt;completely ignore the decades of relatively unchallenged multicultural ideology, the larger non-white populations, and the steps these countries have made towards a multicultural identity at the deeper level than Germany has currently, then it's almost as if you're doomed to repeat these mistakes yourselves if you ask me.

As far as ""the larger non-white populations"" are concerned, Germans look at the banlieues, Rotherham or Molenbeek with sheer horror and readily point out that this is what you get when you allow too many of them in (add-in from the canon of the German Green/Left: ... and exclude them from your society, you fucking French/English/Belgian Nazis).",,/r/europe/comments/c822qx/of_people_aged_15_30_who_say_they_can_read_write/etblpiv/,CodexRegius,1562651267

We're talking about now, not the past.

&gt; China will double the US’s GDP in 40 years

Then post this comment in 40 years, not now.

&gt;Russia are a global superpower, they have the most nukes in the world, they got your president elected, since WW2 Russia have always been a global superpower.

No one but you thinks that, but okay.

&gt;Every single human on earth would rather live in Norway than India, most countries would back Norway rather than India, Norway has much stronger ties to the west, Norway actually wins in the olympics (winter - every time) and produces some of the smartest humans on average, India’s smartest end up moving to the U.K. or US as soon as they can.

This has nothing to do with global power.

&gt;Erm, India has a population of 1.4 billion, a GDP per capita of $2000, that’s laughably poor, that’s beyond poverty. Yes, India is a very very poor country.

Please learn the difference between GDP and GDP per capita.

&gt;You’re aware Norway aren’t in the EU... right? Oh dear me. You’re a special kind of person lmao.

Oh good, so you don't understand how analogies work either. Norway has a very close relationship with the EU. They might not be in it, but they're pretty damn close.

&gt;Yes countries absolutely would start wars if governments authorised kidnappings, and I never even stated wars, again I’ve never met anyone as fixated on putting words in people’s mouths that they never said as you, this could be done through sanctions like those that crippled Iran.

So do you have any examples of this? No? Oh right, of course you don't, because you're pulling this out of your ass.

&gt;Stupid. Again, you’re completely wrong again, prior to that video WPD had been up for years with hundreds of thousands of subscribers, it showed Indians, Chinese and Brazilians being killed, beheaded, ran over etc for years, it only got quarantined because of that specific Norwegian video and banned because of the New Zealand clip. You don’t have a clue what you’re talking about man.

I never went on it, but as far as I'm aware, it had people of every nationality being killed. None of those killings, however, were beheadings by a terrorist organization.

&gt;Piggyback? What the fuck are you talking about, they’re EUROPEAN, we embrace Norway as one of our own, they aren’t piggybacking off anything, that’s like saying Texas piggybacks off of the US, what are YOU ON ABOUT, the US would give special treatment to Norway, like they would for most NATO allies, they couldn’t really give a fuck about India lmao, India is just a country used for cheap exploitation and cherry picking the top 0.001% to be at Silicon Valley for some IT role. Plus didn’t Trump say he wished more immigrants came from Norway rather than shithole countries? (Like Africa / India / South America) Pakistan are a nuclear power and most countries don’t give a fuck about them too, so yes, the US would favour Norway over India for everything other than trade.

Lol, and now you've gone full blown racist asshole. And funny how you quote Trump, since he's the guy who's been shitting on NATO for ages now. Anyway, since you've revealed that your entire argument boils down to your own insanity and racism, I'm not gonna bother replying to you.

In fact, I think Britain is better than America in many ways, but global power is not one of them. Secondly, this whole thing about ""soft power"" doesn't make any sense. See the example above with Norway vs India. India is by far the more powerful country in virtually every aspect on a global stage. You cannot reasonably deny this. That doesn't mean that Norway is worse, it just means that the world is more affected by and is more likely to pay attention to the activities of India than Norway. Someone else tried to claim that soft power is a measure of the influence a country has beyond militaristic and economic power, but once again, you cannot reasonably claim that Norway has more influence than India.

I was simply talking about Janissaries and you directed the conversation to the Ottoman empire as a whole. But okay, since you want to go that route.

Oh my God, your ignorance is staggering. I can tell all your historical knowledge comes from reddit. First of all, the renaissance itself is thanks to the Ottomans. It literally would've never even happened if it wasn't for the Ottomans. Look it up. Secondly, 70% of the Balkans is Turkish culture. Especially further south. So many of your foods, clothes, music, dance, and traditions were brought to you by us. You're welcome. What backwardness was brought by the Ottomans? You know, the Ottomans even gave women 10x more rights than Europe did. And while Ottomans didn't excel at figurative art, they were incredible masters at nonfigurative art, such as calligraphy, tile work, paper marbling etc. There also plenty of Ottoman structures all over the Balkans. Yeah, Romans are you ancestors, that's fucking why I asked if you're ashamed of them invading foreign lands, since, you implied I should be ashamed that Ottomans did the same thing.

This method took alot of skill and British executioners were usually fairly untrained.

I think that's a big part of why the executions had a reputation for being botched so often.

In Russian:

""Зыряне [Коми] роста среднего, кроме удорцев, отличающихся высоким ростом; телосложения крепкого и правильного; следы финского типа на лицах едва заметны; цвет волос большей частью черный, при серых и темно-карих глазах; реже встречаются русые волосы и голубые глаза."" 

""З. остроумны, хитры и находчивы. Изобретательность их выразилась во множестве разнообразных способов ловли птиц, зверей и рыбы. З. любознательны, любят грамотность и способны к учению. 

""З. — православные (есть и раскольники); они религиозны и способны к глубокой привязанности; отличаются честностью, гостеприимством, бережливостью, смелостью и терпением. 

""Им приписывают пристрастие к спиртным напиткам, хотя и не более, чем русским; зырянские девицы обвиняются в недостатке целомудрия [Исключение составляют ижемки, отличающиеся строгой нравственностью.]; сутяжничество доведено у З. до высших пределов.""

Translated:

""Zyrians [Komi] are of medium height, except for Udorians noted for being tall; the traces of Finnish pattern on their faces are barely visible; hair color is mostly black/dark, with grey or dark-brown eyes; fair hair and blue eyes are less common.""

""Z. are sharp-witted, cunning, and resourceful. Their inventiveness is expressed in many diverse ways of catching birds, beasts, and fish. Z. are curious, they like literacy and are able learners.""

""Z. are Orthodox (with some Old Believers); they are religious and are capable of deep attachment; distinguished by honesty, hospitality, frugality, bravery, and patience.""

""They are rumoured to be fond of alcoholic drinks, though no more so than Russians; Zyrian girls are accused of insufficient chastity (with exception of Izhemians distinguished by strict morality); litigiousness/art of complaint is taken by Zyrians to its highest extreme.""",⚑ the glory of Chaos ⚑,/r/europe/comments/cakg3y/finnougric_people_of_northwestern_russia_komi/et9lvfo/,Idiocracy_Cometh,1562600042

We are more warmongering ? And what do you mean by ""allow"" ? Either you are going to not allow aggressive nations to kill innocent people. In which case we will agree we should start fighting the Americans real soon ? Or you are just a bloody hypocrite hiding behind innocent people to justify even more slaughter. 

&gt; So you are saying that those 3 countries have no right to be independent, is that correct?

Given that the Soviet Union gave the independence without fighting over it, I'd say their right to independence is well established. However that does not mean there might not be lingering issues. Second I am confused how you would call having peace-keepers in South-Ossetia a illegal occupation. 

&gt; “Today Russian peacekeepers continue to fulfill their tasks, acting in accordance with the mandate of the CIS peacekeeping forces and international norms. They have proven the necessity of their presence in the conflict zone,” the Russian MoD said, citing the UN Security Council’s April resolution, which notes “an important stabilizing role” of the Russian peacekeeping forces stationed in Abkhazia under the CIS aegis.

5583,"&gt;There are a few minor projects like this, operating under grave danger for their lives (by Muslims). Better not to get involved into it.

I don't know why it's so hard. There have been great efforts to promote ""good Islam"" over ""bad Islam"" in the UK with some success. There are, after all, many moderate Muslims that just want to get on in life living in a western nation. The problem is that ""moderate Islam"" still embodies values that, perhaps 50 years ago most Germans would have found tolerable, but go against the progressive agenda e.g. belief in marriage as an institution, disapproval of homosexuality, excepted by a belief that it must be tolerated and not actively persecuted etc. Making ""German values"" antithetical to ""Islamic values"" and then inviting Muslims to co-inhabit your country seems like a the perfect way to set of powder keg of Islamophobia worse still that what we've experienced in the UK working class communities. 

&gt;For the longest time we have perceived exactly the opposite, namely that they are indeed purporting this - say, till George W. Bush.

If you mean the tired spiel about freedom and democracy that's a song as old as WW2. I don't really see it as equivalent that to the modern situation in Germany. Frankly, for me it seems Americans stopped taking that entirely seriously by the time of the Vietnam war. 

&gt;As long as they are dark-skinned, I daresay. My wife has made the opposite experience when she spent 18 months as an au-pair in London. She was asked about her origins all the time. Just like she would in any other place. That's why I find this taboo matter rather hypocritical.

Not exclusively so. It's about culture and not inherently about ethnicity. The again, there is of course a believe that, if someone ""looks white"", then they are not so readily a victim of racial discrimination in society and thus their is less taboo around asking about their nation of origin. 

Just to give you a recent example, in the context of a discussion of an Indian wedding in India, sitting amongst a group of allegedly progressive Germans, exactly the kind who presume that Britain is inherently more racist than Germany and longs for the days of empire, the first question asked was ""Was it an arranged marriage?"". As if this were an acceptable question to ask in the company of an educated Indian person living in Europe. You might as well draw a sign on your head saying, ""We think of you at little more than unenlightened barbarians come to our glorious land to escape the horror of everywhere but Germany."". To me, this is equivalent to someone saying ""My Chinese friend was having dinner."" and you chip in with ""Was he eating egg-fried rice?"". This naive lack of cultural awareness and tact seems ubiquitous in Germany, even in allegedly progressive circles. In fact, progressive circles can be the worst, so focused on the lack of various enlightened social values in parts of the world that they cannot but see them are pitiable charity cases. 

Meaning of the post-colonial era in the UK (and I dare say France too) has been on the belief that we are no better nor worse than these nations. The only difference being that we have benefited materially from their colonisation, and thus are now obliged to share our nations with a myriad of different ethnicities and cultures. Many Germans seem to act as if Germany were the only civilised nation on earth by dint of their post-Nazi self-flagellation. British society has been entirely rebuilt in the post-war era with this in mind. That in becoming an empire we have obliged ourselves to open society to other nationalities as equals, having earned that status in many ways for aiding us in defeating Nazi Germany. This acceptance of a multicultural identity for so long is why nations like France and the UK are pervaded by the logic of post-multiculturalism, whereas in Germany this shift is much more recent, which is why it's bewildering to me that so many Germans seem to believe they are some kind of beacon for ethnically diverse society. 

&gt;As said in the other posting, they derive their moral superiority from the (maybe mistaken) observation that WE have repented while THEY have not.

More accurately it might be said that Germany has writhed in self-pity and pointless guilt while other nations have attempted to forge ahead leaving the past in the past. I see nothing in German society in culture to warrant this sense of moral superiority. In fact, I see a nation less accustomed to non-European diversity than the UK, France, or the Netherlands, and more patronising and ignorant for it. 

&gt;Whom exactly do we harm? We are in the same manner showing interest in people distinguished by talking with a marked Austrian accent; I don't think anyone is offended by confessing where it came from. So I may freely discuss origins with people whose family history roots in Vienna but never with those rooted in Nairobi? I mean, don't be over-sensitive about it: It's most often simply our way to indicate that we would like to small-talk to you!

I think you contribute to the alienation of foreigners from Germany society at large in doing so. I know a hell of a lot of foreigners in Germany and I would say that most of them hold negative feelings towards German society to some degree on the basis that ethnicity, nationality, and culture seem to be so important to the ethnic Germans that it's hard to move past those things and ever feel like a simple member of society than a foreigner in Germany. Certainly, I somewhere like London offers a certain anonymity as a foreigner than cannot found here. 

&gt;The suggestion was that the impulse to ask for origins was there, even among the English, it was only suppressed by the political agenda. But after Brexit, likely it will no longer be so. Right now already, the soaring number of British incidents of hate crime is observed with much interest, and compared to ours.

I'm sorry, but that's nonsense. Brexit isn't going to completely alter societal norms, nor is it going to mean Britain ceases to be an ethnically diverse nation. People don't engage in such prying because it is socially taboo and can trigger conflict. We're a conflict averse nation because social conflict is, for us, deeply entwined with violence. Unlike the relatively verbal conflict happy Germans, people in the UK refrain from public social condemnation of others because the wrong person will punch you in the face and there will be little the police can do after the fact. 

The rise in hate crime is the product of two things. 1) the emboldened minority of racists who think that they've been given licence to act on their desires 2) the increased awareness of society of the political issue and thus an increase in the reporting of such behaviour. I'm sure at least some of that hate crime existed before Brexit, but nowadays it's a politically hot issue and thus will be given greater attention.  

&gt;Indeed so. There have been street protests in Portugal declaring that this state had not elected Angela Merkel into charge and she should stop presiding over it like she alone knew what was good and proper.

Well yes, the danger of resentment for Germany in southern and eastern Europe boiling over has been on the political radar for a long time. With France tearing itself apart politically and the UK Brexiting the outlook isn't exactly ideal. 

&gt;That's exactly how Germans explain to themselves Trump &amp; Brexit. They can't see how to explain both events otherwise but by a dreadful relapse into the early Nazism of the 1920s. It's almost monomaniac how Germans rank everything by its apparent proximity to Nazism...

Which is, to me, a foolish that could no doubt bite Germany in the arse if it fails to learn the lessons to be learnt here. I see so much here resembling the UK in the early 00s, and given the right pressure Germany could be equally susceptible to political division and upheaval within society. If you explain Trump with the idea that Americans are just a bunch of racists, and Brexit with the idea that Britain is just a bunch of racists / imperialists, and completely ignore the decades of relatively unchallenged multicultural ideology, the larger non-white populations, and the steps these countries have made towards a multicultural identity at the deeper level than Germany has currently, then it's almost as if you're doomed to repeat these mistakes yourselves if you ask me.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/c822qx/of_people_aged_15_30_who_say_they_can_read_write/et93z8y/,kingofeggsandwiches,1562584861

You wrote: ""But it is wrong to blame the people alone, most of the blame is the goverment of the reunification wich had failes to protect the people.""
You also wrote: ""of course people are responsible for the choices they made, I never said that they are not!""

Both can't be true, can it?

And what made me write was exactly the first quoted sentence. That is making excuses for them. Disavowing them from the responsibility of their decisions. You did that. It is right there. So, don't go around writing that you make no excuses for them. That is just a blatant lie.

Oh, and then you go further writing:
""Just do some research on how behaviour and choice is formed. You think that you are against facism because of your free will. That is an illusion, there is no free will. Our behaviour is dictated by billions of experiences we had in our life to that point""

If people have no free will as you write, they are not responsible for their actions and therefore rehabilitation, psycho therapy or even punishing criminals would be pointless. Because they would not be responsible for any of the things they do. Nobody would be responsible for anything.
These things only make sense when we have free will (or the illusion of free that is so good and strong that is is indistinguishable from actual free will).

With arguing that there is no free will, you saying those people had no choice. They had to vote for fascists due to their past experiences. You turn them into victims, ignoring that the majority of their fellow citizens with the same experiences do not vote for fascists.
You wrote that stuff. You start with what is in your opinion an explanation but end up making excuses. And then you lie about it.

The country adopted the measure, **one of the toughest in the world**, after a surge in racist and incendiary speech online, particularly since the arrival of more than one million asylum-seekers in Germany since 2015.

As an American living abroad (in London) I've been surprised that the 'anti-American' transformation hasn't happened quicker simply because most of the news that makes it over here is highly partisan identity politics that is generally less than the full truth. 

Before being downvoted into oblivion, I should preface with saying I'm not a Donald Trump supporter, but it used to be Fox News was the psycho broadcast company that lived on half-truths ... now, in addition to Fox News, it's CNN, NBC, MSNBC, etc. 

Most of the policy / policies Trump is pushing or wants is stuff that ordinary Americans want but it's twisted because orange man = bad. The opposition label everything he says as racist, fascist or bigoted yet cannot provide factual examples of him being the next Hitler. He's an ignorant businessman who doesn't respect others - that does not make him a racist or fascist. 

The other part is if the election were tomorrow, he'd win a re-election (small) handily, and that's important to know for 2 reasons: 1 - we need to start coping with it so there isn't a civil war and 2 - to get people out to vote so that he's not re-elected.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/caiitw/eu_vs_usa/et8z8wg/,YoungDan23,1562577999

5811,"I've written it before on the football sub, but I'll repeat it here:

The consensus of the experts (what I read in The Guardian, BBC and German media) is that USA are a vastly inferior team technically, with a very low football IQ. They have had an edge in physical conditioning that has historically helped them, but not for much longer. France, Sweden, Netherlands, Germany, England and Japan all have superior talent and skill, but the refs also favour USA and several teams (France, Spain) have been robbed of victories against USA via questionable implementation of VAR.

Even though they scraped by with a win against the Netherlands, it's really a disappointing cup for them because they never won convincingly, and they'll never win again since Europe have caught up and closed the gap and will surpass the USA completely within 4 years. This, again, is the consensus of the experts that I read in legitimate media that are taken seriously by most football communities. No matter what happens, the USA should feel demoralised and disappointed by the result.

The result of the cup is a demoralising and disappointing victory for the USA, marking their decline and demise as a powerhouse (as fake a powerhouse as it was to begin with, but never mind).",Europe,/r/europe/comments/cab2km/usa_vs_netherlands_womens_world_cup_france_2019/et8uxoo/,TheChineseJuncker,1562571394
