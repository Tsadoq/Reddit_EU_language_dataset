12,"&gt;History is more than a series of events you memorize.

Ahahah. Of course. History is what absolute morons choose to read it as and come up with laughable bullshit like ""Colonialism brought prosperity to the world"" and ""without colonialism, would you be using the technology that you are right now?""

I just want to highlight again the sheer stupidity of this claim. Anyways, let's proceed onwards with this bullshit. 

&gt;It's not at all unique to you. I see this kind of narrative weaving everywhere. Among Poles, some will weave a story of ""we're the ultimate survivors"" while others weave ""woe is me"" narratives. As to which one they choose depends on their psychological state. People who feel secure about themselves will usually choose the former, while those who feel embarrassed by their people will choose the latter to shift the blame for their percieved shortcomings onto someone else, as to protect their own ego.

Basically just a long winded attempt at excusing your complete lack of historical knowledge and absolutely delusional experience of reality by trying to portray me as some kind of sad soul. I already told my dude: I'm fucking good. Your attempts with this line of bullshit are just sad. If anything they project even more clearly the fact that you have no real line of defense of colonialism, and so you fall back on these pathetic attempts at fanfiction. 


&gt;Not at all. You think I abandoned it because I clarified that my positions aren't what you made put to be (by arguing with people in your head and typing that out).
 
And

&gt;The fact is that area that got technologically advanced to sail the world would inevideabily do so, and dominate the seas and thus the world. It just so happened that the area was Western Europe and people like yourself need to come to terms with that. And despite the fact that there was abuse of that power, those discoveries connected the world for the first time ever, and spread the technology that made that possible to all corners of the world.

You know what's hilarious? I graduated in Economics, with a specialization in Economic History, and I've read quite a few really fucking shit papers by my peers that were done in a hurry to meet deadlines. But I have to say - it takes real effort for someone to come up with a historical worldview that is so comical that it almost sounds like you got your education from playing Age of Empires. Are you seriously going to keep defending this line - that time moves forward and therefore the modern world of scientific advancement is only a reality because of absolutely every prior event having occurred? Do you realize what a fucking nutjob you are to be making such a claim? 

I have quite a few Polish friends and we talk about the state of Polish politics, so I get to hear about certain stereotypes and sentiments out there.

Brandenburg, the part of Germany from the other post which is also directly at the Polish border and heraldically [inverse Poland](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/01/Flag_of_Brandenburg.svg) has always had shit soil that is essentially just sand. The whole history of Brandenburg/Prussia, from religious tolerance to militarism, can be explained by its soil.

But after WW2, they made things even worse by planting fast growing pine trees almost exclusively, instead of slow growing oak trees. This is a big part of the reason why there is such a high danger of forest fires now. Agricultural fields in the east were (and still are) also bigger than in West Germany and therefore more in danger of desertification.

My brother has had two children and has paid almost nothing for either of them.

I have has shoulder issues and if i had a better plan (i was on Obamacare) i would have paid less.

Its great that you think you pay nothing, but you do. It comes out from your taxes and the costs keep rising as more hospitals will demand larger budgets and patients will demand better care. The idea is nice but unsustainable.

Me and nearly my entire family went to public shools near chicago. Which is free. My education was decent. Better than my wifes in many areas because the teachers actually cared about the students because they were paid based off their performance. If they were shit teachers they were asked to leave. My brothers wife is a teacher. She cares immensely about her kids and she is paid accordingly (actually it could be better but of course teacher unions are getting in the way).

My university wasnt free. I took out federal loans which i am still paying. They are not so bad and hopefully in a few years they will be finished. I graduated in four years while many people rack up years of university thus driving up their costs. Again, university was much cheaper before the government started throwing money around.

I dont have such a negative feeling about people as you do. While there are many bad actors, most people are good natured and want to help. Ive traveled to over 15 countries and have a decent knowlege of the the human experience. Yes, people will look to take advantage and these people need to be dealt with. We must encourage being charitable again. Having large governments taking care of people discourages charity.

American foreign policy hasnt always been great. But its been the only thing keeping Europe safe since world war two. What was european foreign policy like from the roman empire until world war two? Yeah. Not good. Westphalian Doctrine was the best doctrine Europe had and American foriegn policy has its roots in this idea.

Yemen war...great left talking point nowadays. This is the middle east...yemen is a disaster filled with sectarian fighting, tribal fighting, and extremist militia fighting. SA is an ally of US unfortunatley, because they along with Israel keep the balance. Would you prefer Iran having control of the middle east? Isis? 

It is a shit show like it always has been for the last 1200 years..

Dont feel bad for me. My life is great. I realize i am a lucky man to have been born in a good country to good parents. Life is very hard around the world, i am very fortunate.

Not only that, the Daesh network and its ilk run deep in terms of logistics within Europe and funding. Only recently was there a massive laundering welfare scam uncovered in the UK where millions of pounds over a decade were being siphoned off to fund these groups. They're also active within major cities to the point that they can run clandestine activities of extortion and intimidation. Most notable example is of the Swedish Kurd who went to fight as a medic in the YPG and he was receiving active and tangible threats against his life in Stockholm.

I've spoken to my Sunni Muslim friends about Lisa Smith and all of them feel that not only she should not be punished but re-assimilated into their community with open arms, their reasoning being that if the Western coalition did't destroy the Muslim countries this would never happen.

For all his glaring flaws, of which their are many, Putin has actually had significant success with the FSB reforms in combating terrorism within Russia, with attacks per year dropping consecutively. This obviously has to do with the judicial perception of jihadists, removing them of their rights as a citizen and dealing with them accordingly, which in Russian fashion is to wipe out all forms of sedition through lethal and specifically applied force.

&amp;#x200B;

We have not only an uphill battle but a mountain to climb, with two extremely slippery slopes on either side. Do we reforms our core European values and weave within the lines of citizenship and human rights based on ones affiliation and actions, which could be a darker pretext for what this degree of seditious hostility can be defined as, and a legal Pandora's box of precedent or do with bank on the hope that we can deal with the issue through reform and reeducation through social programs and hope that our collective moral approach is not ripped off in the process by the percentage who refuse to change.

110,"&gt;Its literally just size. Mongolia isnt powerful just because it is big

Mongolia is a country mostly devoid of everything, with a population of 3 million - that's as much people as in Lithuania. Most European countries can compete on their own with a country like Mongolia.

They cannot compete on their own, however, with major powers like the US, China or India, because the vast space those continent-sized countries occupies is covered with infrastructures and is heavily inhabited, which allow for a massive workforce and countless economic agents to exist, produce, and compete.

That's the comparison he was doing. Size alone doesn't matter, that's absolutely right. But it does play a very important role when you factor in elements like infrastructures and population. 150 years ago, the US were pretty much the same size they are today, but European countries were able to compete with it, because:

1. globalisation wasn't as important as it is today ;
2. the country wasn't as populated and industrialised as it is today.

The context has completely changed since then. Globalisation couldn't be more real, and the US are now a fully developped giant. So are China and India. When you take those things into account, then his comparison absolutely makes sense.

&amp;nbsp;

The very reason the EU is a powerful global actor, able to compete with other continental powers, is very directly tied to being such a vast area. The EU is a highly developped space and is home to 510 million workers and consumers. It allows us to put enough weight in the balance when competing around the globe.

And with economic independence also comes societal and cultural independence. That's the main reason the EU is so important. Not because it makes us wealthier, but because it guarantees our independence in every senses of the word.





The economies of small places like Venice and Genoa (in the past), or Luxembourg and Singapore (today) are exceptions, which are only able to exist by relying on the economic and industrial activity of their neighbours/partners. Those with enough room to grow the bulk of a strong, diversified, powerful economy, precisely. And to do so, you need space to host cities, industries, inhabitants.

, and they are not self-sustained: they focus on services like banking and similar, meaning they are entirely reliant on the economic and industrial activity of their neighbours/partners. Those with enough room to grow the bulk of the economy, precisely.



His comparison isn't as meaningless as you believe. Comparing those areas based on their size is very much relevant, **when you factor in other elements, like the population and infrastructures**.


You cannot obtain that kind of productive and economic power with - which are directly reliant on their neighbours for.

Size is very much relevant to . You can only have so much tiny countries basing their economies on finance, tax ~~evasion~~ optimisation and similar immaterial activities in the services sector.


Tiny countries tends to have economies mostly relying on finance, tax ~~evasion~~ optimisation and other similar activities in the services sector, because they have neither the room, nor the population to sustain primary, secondary and sectors - which are the fundamental blocks of economy.

I'm not going to ask if you're on drugs because I know that this is caused by a simple case of absolute stupidity. 

Do you realize that you're describing the basic forward motion of time? You're trying to suggest that we have modern technology only because Colonialism occurred at some point during history, and scientific advancement could not have occurred in any other way. You realize how fucking stupid this is right? This is like trying to justify slavery in America by saying that the iPhone would never have been created because if South didn't have slaves, the civil war wouldn't have occurred - and if the civil war hadn't occurred than it wouldn't have lead to the **exact** series of historical events that lead to modern technology.


Along those lines, do you know how many potential Indian academics, mathematicians, scientists and artists were killed by the Empire whose scientific and artistic accomplishments we could have benefitted from?

Also - what a fucking coward. What happened to claiming that Colonialism spread prosperity ***around the world***. Are you going to just back off from that claim now like the piece of shit that you are? Now you admit the prosperity wasn't equal and didn't benefit the people that were colonized?

&gt;Again, are you on drugs?

Imagine being so fucking stupid that you try to justify Colonialism and argue that it brought prosperity because time moves forward. Along those lines we wouldn't have gotten the modern automobile, the jet engine, or space travel if it wasn't for The Nazis and their Holocaust. Time to claim that the Nazis brought prosperity!

In the nearby shops. Prices doubled during last few years - for locally produced bread, poultry, fish, dairy.

Also some industries collapsed completely (tourism, building, car assembling). Non-food retail lost from third to half of sales. Those 1-2% GDP/PPP loss numbers are pure bullcrap.

If Peter Thiel was simultaneously retarded and racist he would be you. 

&gt;Despite colonialism having had negative effect, it was also crucial in spreading ideas like science and lawful governance.

Imagine having such a poor grasp of history to not realize that science, ethics, law, and governance thrived in many of the colonies before Colonialism - and the starvation, murder and subjugation of millions killed immeasurable scientific potential. In the same manner, imagine the thousands of Jews and millions of innocent people killed by the Nazis that could have contributed to scientific and technological advancement. It takes someone truly fucking stupid to suggest that slavery, subjugation, genocide, and murder that has already occurred would have been the only way for us to create our modern world.

From the picture I'd guess no amount of rain would make much grass, let alone wheat or vegetables grow there in the forseeable future. Also, minerals and organic materials will wash out and stuff will erode further, but I doubt that matters much anymore.

There surely are plants that can deal with this and will grow there, over time creating a new soil. probably would need some windbreaks to prevent constant shifting and further deteriorating. Over time means a pretty long time, btw.

521,"Germany is phasing out nuclear energy due to similar fear-mongering, but they still use it at present. When Fukushima happened, Germany generated about a quarter of its power with nuclear powerplants. At present, it's about 11%, which is still roughly ten times more than the Netherlands. Not to mention, Germany has a lot more resources for renewable energy than the Netherlands. Building a hydro-electric system is, for instance, completely impossible in the Netherlands. Owing to high population density land used for renewable energy is comparatively more expensive.

The Netherlands is one of the few Western nations, if not the only one, that does not get a significant percentage of its energy from nuclear power. The Netherlands also does poorly in this map. This is not a coincidence. This is a direct result. One I find all the more painful, because the pro-environment people decrying this are also often the loudest voices against nuclear power.

And given that Belgium already has two plants on our border, the argument of potential risk is quite laughable. We already suffer the risk, with no advantages.

To curb the ethnicity problem are we going to prevent non native ethnicities from procreating, are we going to pay for certain groups to procreate more? This is all discrimination based on race and ethnicity which is intolerable in a Western Democracy.

People who makes the go back to Europe argument are morons. Americans are not Europeans because of some vague genetic connection that is evidenced by skin color. If they were born in America or engaged in the proper naturalization process, they are culturally American, they are Americans, same goes for European countries.

I'm talking about legal migration by the way, the person I initially responded to was just talking about ethnicity devoided of how legal it was as evidenced by the 80% figure. If it is outrageous that eugenics are even though of as appropriate outside of scientific genetic manipulation.

Now to answer the questions:

We gave them back their land, but that doesn't prevent legal migration from being a reality. Isolation is a threat to Europe just as much as unregulated migration as evidenced by the Chinese isolationism that allowed Western powers to surpass them during the last two millennia or the separation of Tasmania from main land Australia and the technological retardation of the native Tasmanian population due to that split.

Nobody is colonizing anyone if regulated migration is enforced properly, however there is issue with people believing eugenics is a valid stance to have once unregulated migration becomes a problem.

I don't care what the Chinese do, or Africans, or Americans. I care about Europe. The humanist values we have built up for the last 600 years are not negotiable regardless of what foreigners do. And if you think some how them doing so is good, Japan has a youth shortage that is harming the country and China is an authoritarian country that is imprisoning it's own population for holding diverging belief. If you want to compare us to states who's values are either causing them economic problems or who's values are abhorrent be my guest but I generally like to think we are better than this.

There are several studies that point to migration being positive for the economy. Again, regulated migration is key.",Poortugal,/r/europe/comments/bg2whi/france_calls_for_eu_to_pool_resources_to_protect/elkm6hx/,Shadowxgate,1556027428

&gt; Lebensrisiko oder allgemeines Lebensrisiko ist ein unbestimmter Rechtsbegriff, der alle Gefahren beschreibt, die zu rechtlich relevanten Nachteilen für Menschen führen können und nicht durch gesetzliche oder vertragliche Haftungsnormen geschützt werden. Der Begriff wird auch in der sozialpolitischen Diskussion verwendet. Der Mensch ist im gesellschaftlichen Zusammenwirken, aber auch bei Einwirkungen von Umwelt und Natur, einer Vielzahl von Risiken ausgesetzt, denen er sich selbst bei größten eigenen und fremden Anstrengungen nicht vollständig entziehen kann. Diese Gefahren können und sollen nicht durch das allgemeine Haftungsrecht auf andere überwälzt werden, so dass hieraus resultierende Schäden vom Einzelnen zu verantworten und zu tragen sind. Ein großer Teil dieser Schadensrisiken ist noch nicht einmal versicherbar, lediglich ein geringer Teil hiervon wird durch (Sozial-)Versicherungssysteme abgedeckt, wodurch die sozialpolitische Komponente des Lebensrisikos in den Vordergrund rückt. Schäden aus dem Lebensrisiko sind ein Teil der Selbstvorsorge. Vom Grundsatz her ist die individuelle Schädigung in bestimmten Fällen auszugleichen; das wird von entsprechenden Haftungsnormen sichergestellt. Das allgemeine Lebensrisiko indes weist die Haftung anderer Personen zurück und überlässt sie dem Geschädigten. Beim Lebensrisiko liegt zwar ein haftungsbegründendes Handeln des Schädigers vor, seine Schadenshaftung wird jedoch verneint. Das allgemeine Lebensrisiko ist somit ausnahmsweise ein Rechtsgebiet, bei dem jemand haftungsverursachend handelt, aber dennoch nicht dafür einstehen muss.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/bfyp81/syria_war_kosovo_brings_back_110_citizens/elkmqep/,zehferris,1556027807

No, I meant a regular dress. The burka is not some special clothing, it's just a regular piece of dress that women would wear. Like denim jeans are today.

&gt; On the other hand, I assume that the people on the photo genuinely wore the veil

What does that mean? Do women 'genuinely' wear skirts? Genuinity has nothing to do with this.

&gt;  
&gt;The objective of 'Bullseye' is to better prepare all emergency services involved in a chemical and/or biological terrorist attack. It is part of the implementation of the European Commission's 'Action Plan to enhance preparedness against chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear security risks'.  
&gt;  
&gt;The project will harmonise the intervention procedures of seven types of emergency services:  
&gt;  
&gt;Special Police Units;  
&gt;  
&gt;Fire brigade and civil protection;  
&gt;  
&gt;Medical services;  
&gt;

&gt;  
&gt;Defence;  
&gt;  
&gt;Disaster Victim Identification and forensics;  
&gt;  
&gt;Labs.  
&gt;  
&gt;The project will also expand and harmonise the training facilities for explosives dogs.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Crisis Centre is the coordinator of the consortium, which also consists of the following partners:  
&gt;  
&gt;International Centre for Chemical Safety and Security (ICCSS), Poland;

Good lord gracious what did you expect from a compact sedan heavier than most SUVs on wide tires...

This is an inherent design bottleneck of EVs, not a quality issue that can be solved fast. You can mitigate quite a bit by going with smaller tires. 

If it interests you there is a Norwegian guy on youtube who does video comparisons on EVs and has a good video comparison of EVs currently on market and why Audi etron (the all-electric one), Jaguar i-Pace are designed differently and how Tesla's aerodynamic body-styling make it peak in the class at the moment.

&gt;It was mix of very stiff and overly bouncy at the same time

Because it's heavy so you expect body roll but low-center of gravity means it's very rigid when horizontal force is applied, but the complete opposite for vertical. Really it's more smooth ride than sporty, if you want something engaging then a shorter wheelbase BMW is probably a safe bet.

&gt;For my use, I'd need to own EV for 12 years to break even

No offense, but If you have to own a new car for any longer than 5 years you are way over budget. Cars are hit and miss and you often have to ditch them for reasons beyond your control. Obviously a good car you should keep as long as you want, but you can't count on it. Moreover, if you drive very little then the benefit of a new car goes amiss and depreciation will make your cost per distance traveled crazy high even for an affordable vehicle. New cars never make financial sense, but they make the least nonsense only if you drive a lot and prepared to go from new to new every X years.

&gt;Right now I doubt I'll get EV in next 15 years looking how slowly market is moving.

It's actually moving crazy fast right now as battery prices have just in the last two years gone from €250 per kWh to below €100. And if looking used, PHEV with a good range like Ampera/Volt and Outlander PHEV exist. You can already get them low mileage at €15K from dealership. The 50km range Mitsubishi promise and 80km Opel/Chevrolet promise is actually fairly accurate, but obviously lower if you do highway. There's a huge difference between PHEVs, Volvo T8 powertrain didn't convince at all for example as max range is like 30km and the overly thirsty petrol engine cancels out pretty much all cost savings.",Finland,/r/europe/comments/bg7e5p/most_popular_car_brand_in_europe/elk7nky/,RassyM,1556013018

I think not.

1017,"&gt; But rapist being protected by judges is a general problem in our society - not exclusive to the church.

No rapists were ""protected by judges"", a hospital denied a victim of rape medical treatment citing their religious affiliation as the reason.

And because these kinds of religious institutions are subventioned by taxpayer money, as they claim to be ""charitable"", and very unique in their existence, it is a problem rather exclusive to the churches operating them.

&gt; The misinformation i was refering to: priests are not payed by the government.

He confused [Bishops with Priests](https://www.gehalt.de/news/wer-zahlt-gehaelter-der-pfarrer), an easy mistake to make for people who lack knowledge of the organizational structure of these Churches. But he also didn't mention how all of these religious positions get the same advantages as somebody working in the public sector or how the German government is paying out around half a billion €, out of the general tax-pot, **in addition to the Church-tax**, to subsidize these Christian institutions.

&gt; The church doesn’t make profit with processing costs from the government.

The church doesn't make a profit when the government handles all the processing costs of collecting membership fees for said churches?
Do you know how this is called in the business sector? Outsourcing!

Case in point: If you'd run a business and have debtors who won't pay, you will very quickly learn how convenient it would be to simply outsource all the collecting to somebody else, that's *exactly* what churches did.

&gt; They get the same financial support for kindergardens that all private kindergardens get.

In addition to all the other benefits, like having the government collect your membership fees for your club.

1054,"This is going to be a bit long.   


Post-2008 and pre-2015 Ukrainian governments pissed money away on by creating two markers of ""stability"" in the minds of their voters: artificially low UAH-USD exchange rate and artificially low gas prices for non-industrial consumers. Here and further on when I say gas, I would mean both the actual gas as fuel and other utilities sold to households where gas is used, like central heating for cities that have it and so on. 

The idea of these two numbers representing stability meant that now people see the actual sustainable exchange rate and prices to be artificially high, and it is the NUMBER ONE expectation from the new president to return to the times of lower prices. Zelenskiy, being the weasel that he is, did not actually promise to do that, moreover, his advisor said the day after elections that this is not in their power to do, but the public expectation is there.

So, what we did pre-2008. Ukraine bought gas, mostly abroad, and then sold it to non-industrial consumers at a discount of up to 70%. This had the following effects:

1) The balance money had to be found somewhere. Mostly, it was found through borrowing abroad. Then, when noone would give us money anymore, we burnt monetary reserves. By early 2014 we were in debt, with large payouts on that looming on the horizon and the money reserves were gone. 

2) The low price for all is effectively a better subsidy for the largest consumers. The more you consume, the bigger the subsidy. This means that there is no incentive to be efficient whatsoever. People regulated temperature in their houses by opening windows (instead of turning down heaters). Wall insulation - what's that? Replace old windows with new ones that seal better - why bother? We have the highest average in house temperature in Europe (at 20+C). And the most energy inefficient economy (2 times as inefficient as next nearest, which is Bosnia and Herzegovina).

3) This also creates a field for corruption (and the best way to fight corruption is not flashy arrests, but removing the conditions where it is profitable). See, the low price is only held for non-industrial consumers. Industry has to pay the full price. At a 70% difference, what happens is many industrial consumers will gladly pay part of the price to distribution organizations in bribes and those will chalk their consumption as ""non-industrial"". State budget eventually picks up the slack.

4) We actually have one source of cheap price - our own gas wells, in Ukraine. But because, again, populists in charge went around touting ""this gas is for the people"", our own gas miners had to sell gas to the state at a price that would not let them maintain current equipment, let alone drill new wells. This meant that our own gas production steadily decreased.

5) And we bought gas mostly from Russia because they gave us a ""discount"". The problem with that is that despite a lower per unit price, it is actually much more expensive, because Russia is in no way interesetd in us becoming more efficient, so gas contracts with Russia always included an obligatory minimum quantity which Ukraine MUST pay for, that way a lot higher than what Ukraine could actually use.

&amp;#x200B;

What we have now:

1) IMF helps us re-finance previous loans at a lower rate so long as we adopt sustainable fiscal policies. 

2) Local gas producers get to sell gas to the state at market prices, which means we are more and more reliant on our own production, not on gas bought abroad.

3) We buy gas where it is cheapest. Funny, how it is cheaper to buy gas from Europe (some of which is Russian in origin), than it is to buy from Russia directly.

4) Bloodthirsty IMF and Worldbank sponsor 0% loans for Ukrainian households that want to spend money on becoming more energy efficient (i.e. install insulation, buy efficient heaters, new windows, etc).

5) While IMF demands that prices be brought up to market levels, they recognize that it cannot be done in one go, so they are still lagging behind, just not so much/

6) People who cannot afford to pay for utilities get subsidized, if utility bills are over 15% of family income, and your house is under a certain size, you do not own any luxury items, etc  (it's a bit more complex than just that, but this is long enough as it is). This is better than the ""effectivesubsidy for everyone"" we had before, but still not ideal. As you would expect people who get subsidized use more gas per person or per sq meter than people who pay the full price out of pocket. So the next stage is monetizing subsidies - basically if you are eligible for subsidy they do not slash your bills by that amount, they give you that much money and it is up to you to spend it as wisely as you can. If you spend less on gas the rest can be used as you wish.",,/r/europe/comments/bg15n4/why_does_the_imf_want_ukraine_to_allow_gas_prices/elk3oj6/,vstromua,1556005967

First point: The dikes we have haven't broken since we had a massive hurricane in like 1952 and since then they've been upgraded so much a flooding is close to impossible, besides that we could build on either the waddeneilanden or the inland which isnt underwater.

Second: Setting a time limit for climate goals to be reached is counterproductive and only makes an environment where people want short term solutions. we need to take our time when we're talking about the planet. Also, if we started now then the power plants would probably be finished by 2030 which is 20 years before that useless time limit.

Third, I'm not aware of this but i'll assume you're right. This is once again short term thinking. we keep telling ourselves we need to save the earth within a few years but that is just not true, if we're going to save the earth we need to be thinking about 2100 2200 2300 and beyond, not 2060. we need long term solutions to the problems, what we don't need is short term thinking.

&gt;What's wrong with Lviv dialect? It's dialect not another language, there is no huge difference, there are just couple words commonly used in daily speech, don't exaggerated it.

Not only some words but also a different accent and slightly different grammar as the Lviv dialect was influenced by Polish more than by Russian.

&gt;There are patriots there as well, just no so many as here, which means it's most probably to be pro-russia there because of almost century of ethnic cleansing against Ukrainians. 

That's already xenophobic, you want to forbid Ukrainian people to run for president just because you're from a different part of country and because you think this part of country is not patriotic enough? So basically you want Ukraine to be one country, but ruled exclusively by people from the west, with certain political views, disrespecting the opinions of the vast majority of Ukrainians who live outside of the west? That's what totalitarian regimes do. And you should realize why western Ukrainians are stereotypically labelled as nazis by many other Ukrainians.

Anyway, how can you define 'real' patriotism? Why do you think only your, western Ukrainian version of history, with Bandera as the national hero is the only 'patriotic' one? Why can't you accept that other Ukrainians could have different views what Ukraine is and should be and they aren't any less patriotic? 

&gt;Yeah, I bet you would want federalization, just like putin wants.

1214,"Are you just going to Pula or any other cities in Croatia? 

When you go to the Arena see if there is a concert going on one of the evenings you are there. I am not really an opera person, but I was convinced to see the the cantata Carmina Burana- so worth it because it was a light show too. The song “O Fortuna” in that venue was chilling. 

It might be too cold to swim If you’re going in May, but if it’s June it may be perfect. I was there for a heatwave in July but from speaking to family the temperatures are always pretty mild on the coast. I suggest going out to one of the many areas along the coastline by an area called Valovine. If you can find a place called the Grotto that spot is beautiful to swim in. The beaches are all rocky just as an FYI. Just above the Grotto on the hillside is an old war bunker. Pula is full of old Austro-Hungarian Fortresses. A second one we went to was called Tvrđa Bourguigion. There’s a cool pyramid by it that was used for discos or something of the like. There are many more including one up on the hill in the center of town. I didn’t get to go there but it is a maritime museum.

There are tons of Roman ruins throughout Pula. We couldn’t find the little amphitheater when we were there but it’s behind the Archeological Society (it was closed for renovations).  There are also ruins of other old structures littering the city. Other ruins we saw include the remnants of a mausoleum and the Gate of Hercules. The Temple of Apollo is also extremely impressive, but one of Pula’s gem in my opinion is the Zlatna Vrata. It’s a treasure to hang out in that square. 



Again I’m not sure about the season, but the Merkat was open when I went and it had lots of seasonal goodies to purchase and try. 

If you can swing it head up to Rovinj for the day and you won’t be disappointed. This town has a beautiful church that rises up and meets the ocean right on the edge of the the peninsula it sits on. It was such a treat to walk up to get to the church.

But I don't think that counts as being religious. Praying is not a thing we do, we don't go to church on Sunday or on Easter or whatever, we aren't active in the church in any way.

Most (upper end at least) weddings have a priest because it gives it an aura of spirituality and class, not because anyone is religious. And at funeral it comforts people. But other than that people don't go to church even, maybe some do for Christmas but I have never been. Some dude put some water on my forehead when I was little, but like my parents said, it doesn't hurt so why not.

Seems strange that Sweden only has 50% irreligious people considering it used to be in the high-70s, and I doubt people have returned to religion.

Here's another report from an established newspaper, from [https://www.metro.se/artikel/sverige-v%C3%A4rldens-tredje-minst-religi%C3%B6sa-land-xr](2015), which claims that Sweden is the third least religious country in the world, after China and Japan.

1622,"I would agree that her coalition in general seems weaker than past coalitions. This is because they don't have a large majority and everyone is fed up with the ""grand coalition"" of SPD+CDU/CSU, including the SPD, which only entered into the coalition reluctantly. It is not directly related to Merkel imo.

&gt; I'm not sure she has the same ability to threaten people or make trades to get something substantial done 

Looking back, I don't think Merkel was ever known to ""get things done"". She mostly did what was opportunistic at the time. For example after Fukushima and a subsequent defeat of her party by the Greens, she announced the shutdown of nuclear power, even though she had cancelled the shutdown of nuclear power by the previous government (yes that's a triple negative). Some other big milestone of her chancellorship were the suspension of the draft and the full equality of gay and conventional partnerships (mostly adoption rights). These were initiatives from her coalition partner, not from her party.

Also, I don't think Merkel ever ""threatened"" someone publicly. However her word still carries weight in her own party. She had to fight off a ton of usurpers over the years and when one of them ([Friedrich Merz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Merz)) tried to gain a seat in her cabinet last year, she dismissed him rather bluntly. Also when an east German CDU leader pondered the possibility of a future coalition with ""[The Left](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Left_(Germany))"" (a democratic socialist party that is strong in east Germany), she basically vetoed that possibility and the debate was over ([German article](https://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2018-08/union-linke-koalition-absage-angela-merkel)).

1728,"&gt; Its about older generation that have been watching TVP their whole life, everyday at the same time. They are not going to change and flip the channel. They will absorb the propaganda and be brainwashed by it. 

Thats their choice then. 

But now lets look at the situation under the previous government. These people didnt have that choice, all the mainstream channels  (by that I mean: free and accessible everywhere in Poland, basically if you had a TV - you could watch them) had the same bias, they were all pro government. People literally had to pay for cable/satellite to get access to channels with differing views. 

Only around 2014 did Radio Maryja and Republika become mainstream, but they still were no where close to the level of the other big channels, all of the TOP4 most watched informational programs were pro gov. Currently, 2 out of the TOP4 are pro gov and the other 2 are anti gov. Is that not an improvement?

To be clear: this is not thanks to anything PiS did, but it is undeniable that television media has improved since then, simply because there is actual pluralism (differing opinions), despite RWB claiming it is under threat now.

Yes, he's definitely not Poroshenko, in the sense than only Poroshenko is Poroshenko, but this whole seeing him as a man of the people and a fresh face is ridiculous.   


He won because he outdid Poroshenko in populism, because he was an ideal presidential candidate. His main point, his only point was avoiding offending any category of voters at all costs. He was intentionally vague on all and every policy issues. As a result, people who vote for him are very evenly split on many key points (Poroshenko's voters are far more uniform):

56% of Zelenskiy's voters want to integrate into EU and NATO. 35% want to stay away from political blocks and be neutral.

55% of his voters are think that friendly relations with Russia are only possible after full restoration of Ukrainian territorial sovereignty and compensation of all losses caused by Russian aggression. 32% are ready for a compromise.

52% think that Ukrainian language needs special protection and support from the state. 41% think that all languages must have equal support.

47% think it is better to follow free market economic policies. 41% want more state oversight.

29% think that total ban on sale of agricultural land should be lifted. 59% think it should stay. (His program explicitly states that he is for lifting the ban!)

&amp;#x200B;

As you can see he can keep on being likeable for all those people only so long as he does nothing. As soon as he takes a position on any of those issues (and he'll have to now) - he starts antagonizing his own voters.

Hell, the number one expectation from him, the thing most people want him to do in the first 100 days of presidency is ... lowering utility bills! His representative has just (after the election) admitted that it is not in the Presidents power to do that directly. 

You can't do what people want you to do, but so long as you keep a mysterious silence on the issue, they will take your silence for whatever promise they want.

&gt;**The World Jewish Congress (WJC) has voiced outrage over a Polish town's ritual beating of a Judas effigy which looks like a caricature Orthodox Jew.**

&gt;More than three million Polish Jews were murdered during World War Two.  
&gt;  
&gt;In total Nazi Germany murdered about six million Jews in death camps in occupied Poland and killing fields in the former Soviet Union.

Maybe the situation depicted by the first sentence is not right, but how do you link it to the other sentences? What does it have to do?

And the last part:

&gt;Last year a diplomatic row erupted between Israel and Poland after the conservative Polish government made it an offence to allege that the Polish nation was complicit in Nazi crimes. US officials also criticised the new law.  
&gt;  
&gt;Later the Polish government watered down the controversial law, by scrapping the prison sentences prescribed for such offences.  
&gt;  
&gt;Research shows that thousands of Poles collaborated with the Nazis. But many other Poles risked their lives to help Jews.

1838,"The founders of France's first architectural firm, Denis Valode and Jean Pistre, are opposed to the plans of some of their colleagues to rebuild Notre-Dame Cathedral with contemporary elements. ""It is absurd to artificially recreate the [quarrel between the old and the new](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarrel_of_the_Ancients_and_the_Moderns),"" they warn.


Denis Valode and Jean Pistre, who run the first architectural firm in France, are protesting against the desire of some of their colleagues to modernize Notre-Dame de Paris during its reconstruction. Less mediatized than some French ""starchitects"", they nevertheless multiply projects all over the world, from the giant exhibition park of Shenzen to the surroundings of the world's tallest skyscraper (1 km) in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. 


They have designed tours in Russia, Lebanon, Morocco, China, but also in Lyon and La Défense. They were responsible for the renovation of the Grande Arche in the Paris business district and the next metamorphosis of the Gare du Nord in Paris. As well as two future stations of the Grand Paris Express. Or the modular Pierre-Mauroy stadium in Lille, the new exhibition centre at the Porte de Versailles, a project to extend Monaco to the sea... Which does not prevent them from becoming defenders of their heritage.


**Should Notre-Dame be rebuilt strictly in the same way or can we afford to add a contemporary touch?**

Our Lady must be rebuilt exactly the same! We must have the courage and humility to do it again as it was before the fire. It is with dismay that we see this controversy arise: it is absurd to want to artificially recreate the quarrel of the old and the new. We are told about the Reichstag in Berlin, but that has nothing to do with it: this political building had been burned by the Nazis, so we had to write a new page of history by rebuilding it differently. On the contrary, Notre-Dame is the emblem of Paris, a symbol for all French people. It is a nine-century icon that we have inherited and that we must repair because we have not been able to preserve it. It is absolutely essential to avoid organising an international competition, with architects from all over the world who do not know the subject and who will want to take advantage of it to graft an unwelcome architectural creativity on the building. The risk is the posture.


**Is it even possible to reproduce a perfectly similar cathedral?**

Of course! The magnificent spire of Viollet-le-Duc, the roof, the structure can be reconstructed very well in the same way, with the same materials. Let us take this opportunity to show that we can do it. In France, we have all the know-how, all the qualified craftsmen and all the necessary resources. We are told that it is impossible to find so much quality wood: it is not true! To rebuild the structure, 1,500 m3 of oak will be required, or 4,000 m3 including the falls. In France, we produce 200 times more oak every year. The Tronçais forest in the Allier region has the most beautiful oak grove in Europe, including trees planted by Colbert 350 years ago.


**But can we rebuild in the same way... in five years?**


That's another story. But there is no reason why an oak frame should take longer to build than a metal frame; concrete is even longer. We are told that wood must be dried for 20 years: again, this is not true! Today, there are very fast drying techniques available. Afterwards, it is always possible to change one or two details, such or such stained glass, for example. It will also be necessary to install a super fire detection system. But we do not need ""starchitects"" who dream of taking advantage of the sinking of the cathedral to go and implant contemporary art there under the pretext that we should go fast. In this sense, we are in complete disagreement with our colleagues Jean-Michel Wilmotte or Dominique Perrault, who want to use modern construction materials, metal, concrete, titanium…

Are you saying billionaires don't have enemies? What kind of lazy-ass argument is ""who'd bother doing anything?"" uhh, people, they always bother.

&gt;Who could stomach killing 300 people in the process? 

There are millions out there killing far, far more. Why would you think nobody in the world could stomach killing people, plenty of people, especially with explosives? 

&gt;Why not do it in a less public way with less collateral damage?

Plenty of reasons: 

- sending a message of the kind of atrocious and unscrupulous enemies you're dealing with

- showing off to potential customers - there are plenty of people who pay for violence, including governments, drug cartels, corporations, you name it.

&gt;so why go after his family?

I'd say the family would know best what kind of reasons would exist for any kind of retaliation against them. There's a very old saying in my country that basically amounts to ""nobody makes a lot of money without doing something unethical and immoral and a ton of enemies"".

&gt;This probably took a long ass time to plan and coordinate, so how on earth would they have known the family wanted to go Sri Lanka, let alone that specific hotel, at that particular time? 

Your argument is that ""this attack took a long time to coordinate"" = ""they were very well prepared"" so  ""how could they know of this well known and easy name to look-up rich person's family?"" = ""any basic prep could've verified it if they were so well prepared"" ?

&gt;Conspiracies are just fucking retarded,

Conspiracy is just the word you describe to use when you're doubting the simplest version of events and they often end up being true. There was a CIA campaign specifically made to turn the word ""conspiracy"" into crazy-talk which is why you say they're ""fucking retarded"".

So the mere existence of tabloid press titles of questionable fact-checking quality should clearly drop our press freedom ranking, shouldn't it?

Proceeding to the Viking period, the coronians and the oselians used to raid together. 

Proceeding to the Nordic crusades period, you're occupied by the order, we are either fighting them during that period or occupied by them. 

During the northern wars, part of Estonia is ruled by Lithuania and Poland. 

A bit later the Russians occupy Estonia, we were occupied by Russia and Prussia hortly after Estonia was.

After WWI we all declare independence, proceed to have authoritarian leaders in the interwar period. 

Occupied by the Soviets, then the Germans, then the Soviets again. 

declare independence in the 1990's, now both in NATO and the EU, and the Baltic assembly, and as observers in the Nordic Council.

2324,"&gt; Well, I was thinking English being consistent with ""twenty-five"", the larger word should come first

In Germanic languages, like English is one, the larger word traditionally does not come first. In German for example, it's fünfundzwanzig, literally five-and-twenty. This goes up to 99, as you might know from the song ""neunundneunzig Luftballons"". Swedish used to have the same system but switched to the one putting the larger first.

I don't know how or when English arrived at ""twenty-five"" instead of ""five-and-twenty"" though. It might be related to French influences.

And, as that article said, the current staff we have is old. That, or incompetent.

2337,"Because the political landscape is changing. More people are looking for alternatives outside the political centre that is dominated by the CDU/CSU and the SPD. The CDU/CSU might become a bit more conservative again once Merkel is gone, and they might gain a few voters back from the right-wing fringes, but the CDU/CSU won't become a 40+ percent party again anytime soon. Like others have already explained the CDU/CSU is getting teared apart between conservative and progressive interests. They tried to be ""the party for all people"" and lost many conservative voters in the process. Between the last general elections and the elections in Bavaria (CSU home turf) they tried to copy the AfD and by doing so lost many progressive voters who now vote for the Greens.

Overall the time of the big parties is over. We are about to become a bit more like the Dutch with a lot more migration across the political landscape and government coalitions that will have three or more parties. We are still reluctant to accept that since we are not used to this, but that is the direction we are heading towards to. The next legislative period will very likely see a government coalition that we never had before as there will be now combination of two parties that would be strong enough to hold a majority (I have my money on a coalition between Conservatives and Greens, probably with the Liberals between them).",Niederrhein,/r/europe/comments/bfnwpl/german_eu_candidate_proposes_global_ban_on/elh8z8p/,sverebom,1555913467

Usually this is isn't a concern, we are all exposed to small amounts of radon as background radiation. The issue with the design used in some of the older stone houses in Portugal is that the tiny windows (and sometimes rooms without windows) don't provide a good enough air exchange and you end up creating a build up concentration of radon in certain areas of the house which indeed is health risk.


Often the issue is not so much with the granite in the house but with the granite rich soil underneath the house which contributes the most to leaking radon inside the house.

&amp;#x200B;

Mexico for example, not a chance in hell Mexico would fight the US even with foreign support. It had support during it's war with the Americans and the Americans, one of the worst militaries in the Western world had defeated them so bad that they could have completely destroyed Mexico as a country but they essentially drew a line on a map, using a river and decided to fortify that region, letting Mexico become what it is today.. that's another story in itself but we wont go there. 

&amp;#x200B;

Canada is the other one.. the Americans kept 'poking the bear', burnt down Canada's parliament building in an act of terrorism, not giving a flying fuck what would happen in return. The British pushed downward with almost no resistance toward Washington, burning most of the capital. After word had got out that they didn't just burn a single structure but the entire city, anyone who was on the fence about the two countries opted to swing firmly in one direction or another. That bolstered the continental army significantly which allowed the US to push by the British (again), but this time without the assistance of a foreign navy but rather it's own navy. 

&amp;#x200B;

That's it, no other country stands a chance.. the US has historically put in its place the two countries that could have done anything. If it weren't for those wars, I think a country like Mexico might thing ""what if"" but after that, it's not even a thought at all, it's like Japan - they don't even want to imagine 'what if' it happened again, they get really mad when people even talk about it.

Weyler learned this tactic from the American Civil War campaign of General Sherman while assigned to the post of military attaché in the Spanish Embassy in Washington D.C..

That's how every oligarch in Ukraine acts, some are just more greedy than others. Poroshenko, for instance, is actually considered the greediest of them all.

\&gt;Hey, I didn't say I predict him being successful. Only that he doesn't look as dictator material. Most possibly he will fail, and won't manage to be re-elected next time.

They didn't have any dictators in Ukraine yet. Yanukovich was probably the least dictatorial person of them all - nobody else managed to get swept away using a street protest. His successors dealt with rebels using tanks, and probably would have killed a couple dozen thousand of people if they were placed in a similar situation. I don't know where the ""dictator"" label became attached to the least decisive and most spineless person in post-Soviet politics, but it's crazy ridiculous. 

If anyone deserving the name ""dictator"" (even our Lukashenko) would be in his place at the moment that he escaped to Russia, they would have ran to Donetsk and organised a ""legitimate"" government there, raising the east and south behind them and starting (a rather short) civil war which would end with his opponents either hanging from lampposts or in exile. Remember 1993? Yeltsin was (at the time) opposed by nearly an entire parliament, huge portion of people (who went to defend the Supreme Soviet) and even some individual units. What did he do? He sent **fucking tanks** to **exterminate** them all. And he's not even considered a dictator nowadays. Yet you'll give the name to the guy who *unsuccessfully* (well, he *is* spineless) tried to do what Macron did just recently in Paris? lol...

\&gt;Heh, TBH Ukrainian oligarchs kind of remind me of PLC magnats...

Worse. Most of our magnates at least had some sort of patriotic feeling and were willing to unite at times when faced with either a real or perceived ridiculous threat. Sometimes their seemingly patriotic actions actually led to horrible consequences for the country (na przykład Barska Konfederacja), but at least they did have some general idea of what constituted a common good.

Come on, we all know this is a euphemism for “surrender”. What would satisfy Putin enough that he would withdraw from Ukraine? Probably an end to EU and NATO integration, which would essentially mean a return to Russian hegemony over the country.

You don’t seem to understand how Russia sees Ukraine. Russia doesn’t recognize Ukraine as a separate country in its own right, they still see Ukrainians as “Little Russians”. Even a nominally independent Ukraine is an insult to Russia; and the idea of an independent Ukraine that isn’t subordinate is seen as an outright attack on Russia.

This is clear in how Russia and its apologists characterized their war as a “response to Western aggression”. They actually think that Ukrainians choosing any path other than Russian servitude is an aggression against Russia necessitating a military response. This is what Ukrainians have to deal with.

If we know what month X happens, we still need to know which of the ~30 days in that month X will happen.  
If we know only what year X happens, we still need to know which of the 365 days it will happen. 

The dd narrows down the timeframe the most and so is naturally the one most commonly used. This is of course anecdotal. I can't speak for languages or cultures I don't understand or have insight into.",Sweden,/r/europe/comments/bfb852/hope_no_ones_done_this/elgmzgm/,RaccoNooB,1555892857

EU migrants keep the NHS functioning - 5.6% of staff (as of October 2018) in England alone are EU citizens

Rising property prices are down to owners putting them up, based on this false idea that a home being older makes it more valuable. 8% of UK construction workforce are EU nationals (some 175,000+ workers) helping build homes which LOWERS prices

Schools - in 2015-16 alone, 4795 QTS awards were given to EEA citizens that is to say, people in the UK helping teach

https://www.tes.com/news/impact-brexit-education-immeasurable

The fact is that EU migrants are a net economic gain to the UK treasury, in case you don't understand, that means for every £1 of benefit whether NHS, school or whatever they gain, they give back £1.20 in taxes meaning they put in more than they take.

Unlikely with pretty much all other metric measurements, there's no meaningful conversion that ever has to happen with temperature.

I don't think there's many people who use boiling water as a point of reference for much of anything. Even when you're literally trying to freeze or boil water, you don't care about the exact temperature, you either just put the water in the freezer or put it on the stove, so the actual number at which it happens is irrelevant. 

For telling weather (which is what most of us actually use temperature for), I personally think that Fahrenheit is a bit cleaner looking. The normal temperature scale across the majority of the world is usually within the 0F to 100F range, while in Celsius that scale is like -20C to 40C.

3034,"I may annoy some people here by saying this, but... patriarchy, to a large extent. In contemporary politics, homophobia is strongly associated with opposition to social change in general, especially around the role of the family. The same people who campaigned against gay marriage in Ireland were also campaigning against straight divorce a couple of decades before (we only legalised divorce fairly recently) and were campaigning against allowing women in the civil service to remain working after marriage, against allowing women on juries, and so on, in the 70s (we were pretty ducked up in the 70s).",Ireland,/r/europe/comments/bffrev/belarusian_wisdom/elfhztr/,rsynnott2,1555862247
3035,"I think that's far too simplistic a portrayal of the situation. Apart from it being rather difficult to objectively grade the quality of a law, I'd argue there have always been good laws and bad laws. I think what you are referring to is that in the digital age, anything bad just receives way more attention, which is due to the ""news overload"" we are being confronted with on a daily basis, including rampant misrepresentation or twisting of facts, including on social media. Just look at coverage and part-astroturfing regarding Article 13, or last week's consumer protection Directive, where people effectively rip the law apart for not going far enough, even though it still represents an improvement to what we had until now.

As for private television or clickbait journalism -- how exactly should the government interfere here? I'm surprised you would suggest *this* of all things when you're already worried about authoritarian influence. Not that I deny that these problems exist, but they are arguably a result of our current capitalist economy and the concept of supply and demand. Companies in competition with one another will do their best to grab more readers/viewers attention. The fault lies with the people who keep falling for it, instead of migrating to higher quality services. As long as the TV stations or the newspapers don't break any laws, what could the state possibly do aside from continuing to fund public broadcasts?

This is also a problem that came from the internet, by the way. The ability to get your news at the click of a mouse button has made journalism massively more competitive and directly affected the companies' ability to verify their information. Because now a story doesn't have to be done within a day or a few hours, but *right now*, otherwise a competitor will push it live on their servers first.

When you are a private company, what do you pick? Continue to look if whatever you're prepping to report is really true the way you are about to present it, or go live with what you have? If you picked the former, congratulations for sticking with your guns. Unfortunately, in the current environment you'll be going bankrupt within a month, making way for the corporations that did not compromise.

How could this be fixed without changing the economy itself? Nationalizing all the newspapers is probably not something you'd want to happen either.

&gt; And as I've said several times, we already have laws against hate speech. The point is not to get rid of hate speech laws, which would be the equivalent to your comparison with the murder law. The equivalent to the proposed law is to imprison everyone because they could murder someone.

How did you arrive at this comparison? This law would be the equivalent of demanding people on the street to be able to identify themselves if they get stopped by a cop who might want to arrest them for something bad they did.

Laws against hate speech etc. do not serve a purpose if they cannot be enforced. It's the same as the ""Are you 18? [yes][no]"" agegate on porn sites. Yeah, I'm *suuure* that will keep all the minors out.

For *any* law to be enforced on the internet, the suspect must first be identified. Total anonymity on the web, thus, is directly and invariably opposed to this. You can't have your cake and eat it, too.

&gt; Or because they see someone drive a bigger car, or see some celebrity wearing a nice dress on TV, or ...

Things have *always* been that way, though, so this alone doesn't explain the spike in harassment, hate speech, death threats, etc.

The internet changes how we express ourselves, and anonymity is explicitly presented as a *feature* to protect oneself from being confronted by the consequences of what someone says. Of course a lot of people turn into assholes when they think they can get away with it, and this change in behavior makes other people turn into assholes, too, because of how they see how others behave, or how they themselves get insulted. This is part of why it's gotten worse rather than having been visible from day 1, when people still promoted ""netiquette"" on usenet.

It's a chain reaction that slowly evolved online behavior to what we see today, and it may well get worse still as new generations of kids join an internet already as toxic as it is, imprinting them with the current status quo as the new ""normal"". And now we reap the consequences of this hands-off approach as people get their politics from their chosen echo chambers and from fake accounts rather than forming their opinions based on trusted established journalism as was the case decades ago.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/bexqr8/austrian_government_seeks_to_eliminate_internet/elfi0e2/,akashisenpai,1555862258

Another important category of definitions is the class of ostensive definitions, which convey the meaning of a term by pointing out examples. A term may have many different senses and multiple meanings, and thus require multiple definitions.
In mathematics, a definition is used to give a precise meaning to a new term, instead of describing a pre-existing term.

The ten years war  (1868–1878) ,little war  (1879–1880), and the Cuban war for independence(1895–98). Having a war off the coast of the United States wrecked havoc on US shipping and commercial interests in the Caribbean especially in the later part of the war when Spain demanded even US ships be searched for weapons.

This was compounded when the Spanish put General Valeriano Weyler in charge of military operations in 1896. A brutal commander whose atrocities on the island were well documented causing the first mass exodus from Cuba to the US in a refugee crisis. This was also one of the first wars where actual pictures could be printed in news papers and images such as the famous ""pile of bones"". Became rallying cries for intervention in Cuba compounded by yellow journalism as reports wishing for US intervention made up even worse atrocities even after Spain dismissed Weyler for fear of American intervention in the conflict.

This finally ended when USS Maine, docked at Havana harbor exploded. The theories of which are numourous. The Americans blamed a losse Spanish mine in the harbor. The Spanish blamed Cubans try to get the Americans to intervene. The mostly likely culprit though was a coal fire, which was not an uncommon thing to happen in coal powered. This was of course not even close to the first coal powered ship to randomly explode.

3212,"I have two problems with this theory

1) If homosexuality was such a problem for reproduction, you'd think that evolution and biology would have taken care of it. There is either an advantage to having some people being gay or it doesn't cost anything in the grand scheme of things, that's, to me, a good enough proof to say that the psychological ""fight for resources"" is absurd

2) French demographer Emmanuel Todd studied family structure over the entire world through the entire history of manking, he dedicated his entire life to this particular topic. His conclusion on homophobia wasn't there in early societies and therefore probably didn't existed in pre-historic humans. These people were even more fighting for resources than those who now justify this homophobia by this. Now between then and today, we saw a lot of major changes in family structure and in society, most importantly the Church started to spread homophobia and society evolved to give family bloodline more and more importance (people in ancient Rome didn't even have a family name).

Therefore if you want to explain today's homophobia by a scarcity of resources, you have to do it in the scope of today's society : on a homophobic background, in a culture where your own tribe is more important than yourself (community &gt; individuality) and you're treating your children non-equally (inequality &gt; equality), you might see people following this logic. If this is the case, I have a bad news for you : Todd's biggest discovery is a huge correlation between family structure and political ideology (""when you're raised in the idea that brothers are equal, you're already one step away from thinking all men are equal""). 

In his theory, community plus inequality leads to fascism. So if your theory is right, you're on the path towards a fascist dictatorship, at which point, knowing if their homophobia is justified or not is the least of your issues.",Aquitaine (France),/r/europe/comments/bffrev/belarusian_wisdom/elezh9h/,Thelk641,1555847130

3236,"**Lithuania**, officially the Republic of Lithuania (Lithuanian: Lietuvos Respublika), is a country in the Baltic region of Europe. Lithuania is considered to be one of the Baltic states. It is situated along the southeastern shore of the Baltic Sea, to the east of Sweden and Denmark. It is bordered by Latvia to the north, Belarus to the east and south, Poland to the south, and Kaliningrad Oblast (a Russian exclave) to the southwest. Lithuania has an estimated population of 2.8 million people as of 2019, and its capital and largest city is Vilnius. Other major cities are Kaunas and Klaipėda. Lithuanians are Baltic people. The official language, Lithuanian, along with Latvian, is one of only two living languages in the Baltic branch of the Indo-European language family. 

For centuries, the southeastern shores of the Baltic Sea were inhabited by various Baltic tribes. In the 1230s, the Lithuanian lands were united by Mindaugas, the King of Lithuania, and the first unified Lithuanian state, the Kingdom of Lithuania, was created on 6 July 1253. During the 14th century, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was the largest country in Europe; present-day Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine, and parts of Poland and Russia were the territories of the Grand Duchy. With the Lublin Union of 1569, Lithuania and Poland formed a voluntary two-state personal union, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. The Commonwealth lasted more than two centuries, until neighbouring countries systematically dismantled it from 1772 to 1795, with the Russian Empire annexing most of Lithuania's territory.

As World War I neared its end, Lithuania's Act of Independence was signed on 16 February 1918, declaring the founding of the modern Republic of Lithuania. In the midst of the Second World War, Lithuania was first occupied by the Soviet Union and then by Nazi Germany. As World War II neared its end and the Germans retreated, the Soviet Union reoccupied Lithuania. On 11 March 1990, a year before the formal dissolution of the Soviet Union, Lithuania became the first Baltic state to declare itself independent, resulting in the restoration of an independent State of Lithuania.

Lithuania is a member of the European Union, the Council of Europe, eurozone, Schengen Agreement, NATO and OECD. It is also a member of the Nordic Investment Bank, and part of Nordic-Baltic cooperation of Northern European countries. The United Nations Human Development Index lists Lithuania as a ""very high human development"" country.",Denmark,/r/europe/comments/bfnirq/traditional_wax_painted_easter_eggs_from_lithuania/elezs81/,UpstairsAnalytica,1555847555

So, at least on surface, his narrative looks fine -- a person who spent decades exposing and ridiculing corrupt Ukrainian politicians and not seeing anyone trustworthy finally got into politics himself.

Not being a career politician is actually a good thing from Ukrainian voters' perspective, as they see all politicians being corrupt and untrustworthy. So an outsider has higher score than somebody who have been involved for decades.

3486,"&gt; If you consider it a bad thing that people would ""censor"" themselves by not committing a crime under the protection of anonymity, we'll have to agree to disagree. And you are contradicting yourself when you say that, on one hand, it would have no effect on abuse whilst at the same time people would feel they'd have to ""censor"" themselves.


&gt; I don't think it should be up for debate whether or not the perceived inability of the authorities to prosecute someone for their crimes has an effect on that person's likelihood to commit it. This is part of human nature, and we see examples for this behavior in action on a daily basis.

You are still talking about criminal activity. But the law would effect everyone, even those who, for the reasons I've previously mentioned, have no criminal intent, commit no crimes, yet still want to remain anonymous. And there are already laws and plenty ways for the authorities to deal with criminal offenses. We're just talking about a possible way to deter crime, but at the cost of deterring way more good people from contributing positively to society.

&gt;Please, this is just the Weimar Republic all over again. We've been there before. Yes, radicalization is a symptom. It's a symptom of hate preachers taking advantage of and intentionally amplifying and distorting peoples' feeling of insecurity. It's not just up to the government to fix the underlying causes because there will always be an angle of attack, something that could work better or something that seems broken. [...]

I agree that the current situation is not the governments fault alone, and some people are deplorable, no doubt about it. But we pretty much know what causes this misanthropic behaviour, it's again the gap in education, the lack of chances to participate in society in dignity etc. We treat people as 2nd or 3rd class citizens, and to our surprise, these people started to treat others as well as 3rd class citizens. It's their only escape route to tell themselves they are not as bad as the role society ascribed to them. By lashing out against politicians and migrants they elevate themselves above those.

I agree, we won't have an utopia. I'd go even further by saying we shouldn't have an utopia. Because a humane society needs its imperfections, because humans are not perfect. We need those imperfections to learn and grow and better ourselves. But just because we can't reach perfection shouldn't mean we can't strife for something better. And no, that is the job for a government. How they get the different parts of society involved to do their part is up for debate, but they are in power, they have the power to get things rolling. 

So what are we gonna do about it? Trying to scare them into submission, shut them up and harden their reactionary stance, or are we trying to bridge the gap by elevating them when they are down?

We have more and more children growing up in poverty, and I think that has a way more devastating effect on them and on our future society than getting in contact with some posts on social media. 

&gt;I don't want to go off on a tangent here, but as much as I love democracy, there are times I satirically think there ought to be some sort of ""voter's license"", like a driver's license, where a citizen must have demonstrated a certain minimum comprehension of politics before being allowed to vote.

That's the easy route again, just like with the proposed law.
How about we make sure that people are educated enough before they participate in elections, instead of questioning their right to vote?

&gt;Look at the progress we have achieved over the past decades when it comes to consumer protection, labor laws, environmental standards, minority rights, things that all too often go ignored because of this evolutionary trait that makes us pay more attention to bad than to good news. As deplorable as the gap between the rich and the poor may be, why do we ignore that the standard of living has still improved?

You sure have a point. These achievements are often overlooked. Humans have a relative outlook on their surrounding. They usually don't care how big their TV is. They care about how big their TV in relation to their neighbour's TV is. And that's why the gap matters more than the actual economic situation. The other big contributor is the way our society facilitates greed, envy and jealousy, how these traits are exploited to get more out of the people.

&gt;Yes, radicalization is a symptom. It's a symptom of problems that are 50% made-up, engineered by people like Mr. Farage who manufacture rage in an attempt to get the people to vote in a certain way.

And yet we are not talking about a law trying to hold Farage liable, but a law to hamper everyone else in their freedom. Do we need a law that bars Farage from his radio show, or a law that bans newspapers from printing his opinion? Of course not. People like Farage would still find an outlet for their messages, and the planned law doesn't do anything to address the reason why people are willing to listen to him in the first place.

&gt;Yet what we see now is people shutting up others by employing hate speech to create a climate where those who continue to fight for rights are getting sent death threats and bullied into being mute.

These laws have been in effect on the street level for decades, long before the internet was a thing. How does that fit into your view on how we progressed? The internet is changing things, so we should apply what seems to have worked nicely in the physical space there as well if we want to keep progressing.

I disagree. I see people all the time standing up against hate speech as long as it doesn't happen in an echo chamber, it's pretty much a given. And if it's happening in an echo chamber, it doesn't really shut up anyone, because the ones the hate speech is about aren't even in the same chamber.

I'm not arguing about getting rid of hate speech laws. But again, we have already laws against hate speech, and the authorities have ways to deal with it. This is all about how the government is trying to prevent hate speech from occurring in the first place, a seemingly noble goal, but this proposed law is not the right way to achieve that.

In regards to how the internet compares to the street-level real life, I may have not made it clear enough by previously just stating how offenses in real life often go unpunished and how this relates to the internet. Just like a 100% clean society is not desirable, so is   a 100% hate speech free internet not really something to desire. While in real life such a goal wouldn't have much of a chance to get accomplished, the internet works differently. We actually could get pretty close to this level. With automation and AI, a 100% prosecution quota doesn't seem out of reach. But what kind of dystopia would that be? Where humans immediately get punished for mistakes? We have nothing like that in real life, internet and real life are not congruent, and therefor comparisons like ""it works in real life, so we should have it in the internet"" do not work. It's different mechanics, a different scope, and we should learn how we handle the difference instead of trying to make it behave the same way, because that would only break it. 

&gt;I actually think this is part of why these laws have worked so well. Not just concerning antisemitism, but insults in general. Everybody - or, well, most people - knew they could get sued if they take it too far. So they ""censored"" themselves, as you put it earlier. Even if the actual amount of cases was always low, it was a thing that was just in the backs of peoples' mind.

Saying ""they worked so well"" is too broad of a term. What we can say that this problem used be much less of a problem in the past. We also can't say that this ""success"" can be solely attributed to the determent effect of these laws. That would leave out the probably bigger factors, like a heavier focus on decency in education and general upbringing, as well as a more prevalent sense for the accomplishments and a more hopeful anticipation of the future ahead. There is of course more involved than just these examples, it just proves to show that the internet is not the only change.

I'm pretty sure that when the first newspaper was printed, it was immediately identified as a threat by some people, and they quickly came up with some reasons why newspapers contribute to the fall of society. How wrong were those people?

&gt; but I have a hunch that much of our disagreement is a result on how we perceive the world we're living in today. Which is fair; each of us has made their own experiences, after all. I even think we'd have a lot of common ground when we'd be talking economics! But when it comes to the internet, I suppose the last couple years have just made me supremely skeptical about its effects on society.

I wouldn't even say that we disagree that much in how we see the world. It's more about how we remedy the current state of affairs.

Would be interested to learn from a Berliner whether people vlogging in public spaces is a somewhat common occurrence in Berlin nowadays, the city has its own Youtuber (and now perhaps Twitch?) scene but I would not be surprised if the norms around being at least subtle about filming yourself in public spaces were still relatively tight.

Haha! I'd rather turn the tables and say that nothing you wrote about the Weimar Republic has anything to do with the topic at all. 

&gt; The point is that there was no German citizenship by itself. You could only be a German citizen by being a citizen of a member state, just like in today's EU.


I think you are seriously confused. Of course there was German citizenship. I linked to a German passport from that time and there were no separate German ""states"" issuing passports distinct from the German passport. SO there was no Bavarian Passport, or Schwabian passport. 


Just like there are no Californian passports, even though California is a state, but only in the sense of being an internal administrative region. 


You are confusing the meaning of the word ""state"" as an internal administrative unit of a country with the ""state"" as a sovereign international unit encompassing various internal organizational units. 


There was NO Weimar citizenship. The Waimar Repoublic was an informal political based moniker, much like the Fourth Reich was. Can you link us to a passport wit the words ""fourth reich' on the cover? And there was no Bavarian passport. There was only a German passport during that time.


Having now seen a passport from the ""Weimar Republic"" with the words ""German"" on it, can you now link me to a passport that has the words ""weimar on its cover, similar to the EU countries' passorts having the words ""european union"".",,/r/europe/comments/bf6nvz/would_you_call_yourself_a_citizen_of_the_european/elemx7c/,sektabox,1555826408

FROM HRW 

**""To summarize, between 1992 and 1995, the height of the conflict in southeastern Turkey, the PKK is believed to have committed at least 768 extrajudicial executions. Targets included teachers, civil servants, political opponents, off-duty police officers and soldiers, and those deemed by the PKK to be ""state supporters."" In addition, in those same years, the PKK committed numerous large-scale massacres of civilians, usually villagers or villages that somehow were connected with the state civil defense ""village guard system."" For your reference, we have attached an appendix listing the most notorious massacres that occurred during this period and were attributed to the PKK or for which the PKK took responsibility. In these assaults, 360 people were killed, including thirty-nine women and seventy-six children.**

**These actions were not committed by rogue units or commanders, but were PKK official policy.“**

&gt;Turkey is a foreign occupier in Kurdistan. It should just leave. They are nothing like Zetas, FARC or ISIS.

There wasn't ever a ""Kurdistan"" there was never a Kurdish country in what is now modern Turkey. Turkey never invaded or occupied a ""Kurdistan"". Turks conquered Anatolia a THOUSAND YEARS ago and have ruled over it e er since you ignorant clown. There was never a ""Kurdish"" anything there. Kurds migrated there with the Persian invasions.. Turkey conquered it from the eastern Romans who were then selves in turn invaders when you go back long enough. Armenians nationalist claim the EXACT same lands that PKK supported claim to be western ""Kurdistan"" and western Armenia

Turkey isn't an invader its the rightful owner of that land, with internationally recognized by every single state in the world.

Stop pretending like Turkey invaded some imaginary ""Kurdistan"" a few decades ago. Turks have been living on and ruling over this land for a thousand years. There isn't a SINGLE Kurdish building, monument, archeological or historical anything in what you claim. To be ""Kurdistan"". All there is is Turkish Selçuk, Ottoman etc cities, forts, mosques etc going back a thousand years and even some Armenian churches, Roman/Greco-Roman Era stuff/ Hurrian stuff but NOTHING Kurdish..

Pagans did it for a good year of crop or to appease the gods before the battle.

Christians did it to appease God or to stay his wrath from letting the witch live and do her dark magics. 

Both believed bad things would happen if they didn't kill. 

Also both were in the past, and where they should remain. Neither Christians nor pagans (if they even exist anymore) offer human sacrifices or burn witches. 

I see no reason for mocking either for doing their own version of human sacrifice. Nor was Christianity a reason human sacrifice was stopped. It was in decline a lot before that, and that was thanks to the Roman Empire, which was pagan.

Human sacrifice was banned in Roman Empire 100 years before the birth of Christ for example, and even that was not really needed, because by that time it was so rare it didn't really deserve much mention.

3781,"Really, either ""Web"" and ""Internet"" being reduced to any single invention is quite a stretch — it's worse than people fighting over who invented television — but he's probably referring to HTML, the language that a good part of the Web is encoded in, originating with Tim Berners-Lee, as well as HTTP, the protocol to transport it.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML#History

&gt; In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.[6] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes[7] from 1990 he listed[8] ""some of the many areas in which hypertext is used"" and put an encyclopedia first.
&gt;
&gt;The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called ""HTML Tags"", first mentioned on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991.[9][10] It describes 18 elements comprising the initial, relatively simple design of HTML. Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by SGMLguid, an in-house Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these elements still exist in HTML 4.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/bffe3g/your_move_america/eleecdx/,vokegaf,1555817153

The Finno-Ugric language family used to span very large parts of Europe, it is completely logical that the scientific methods show that the languages are worlds apart.

If everybody in the world died and only 1 French guy and 1 Greek 1 guy would remain, then French and Greek would not be automatically more similar to each other. Just because 98% of Finno-ugric languages which have existed have vanished, doesn't make the few remaining ones similar.

It is probably the same ilussion which was common a while ago, ""the end of history"" (all people will get along and be nice and fair to each other). The interesting fact is that this kind of general trend is a cyclical thing that usually comes before the occurance of a conflict.

The same applies to other Western countries (Trudeau's liberals, the Clinton's Democrats, etc).

And Corbyn isn't just a socdem, he's a socialist who understands that his ideology is wildly unpopular so he won't admit it. Allied of the IRA, Hamas' friend, eurosceptic from the very start, supports price control and nationalisation. The only way for him to go further to the left in modern Britain is by picking up the USSR flag. And that's not to mention his buddies like Diane ""Mao Zedong did more good than bad"" Abbott. The man (unfortunately) completely changed Labour and has turned the party into a full blown left wing.

Me personally, I would like to see Poroshenko win. Although he is not the best one, he (and the government) managed to get Ukraine back in shape after the disastrous events that were close to lead the state to total collapse.

Although I understand the view of some people who want to see new faces in politics, it is a very dangerous game to play now. The situation right now is very difficult, and requires someone who is talented in political sphere. Zelensky does not have this quality. 

I am still quite unsure of what Zelensky plans to do to change the situation. His opinions seem to change every day, and the fact that he called those mercenaries in ‘DPR’ and ‘LPR’ “rebels” doesn’t bring me much hope. I really hope that his advisors will be wise.

It is understandable that people are tired because of war, and are not that happy with current status quo, but in my opinion the slow progress is the best path to ensure stable and strong Ukraine in the future.

&gt;Romanian-Jewish population before WW2? 700k

&gt;Romanian-Jewish population now? Roughly 3k.

&gt;Number of Jews who were directly murdered by Antonescu’s Iron Guard? Approx 300k.

&gt;Second most common former country of origin of Israelis? Romania.

I will just assume you're grossly uninformed, because otherwise you're either a liar either stupid

First of all, some 400,000 Jews survived just well inside Romania and emigrated to Israel in the 60's. Shimon Perez, Israeli president, had thanked Romania for allowing them to survive during nazis rule in Europe (and Antonescu rule in Romania, actually)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEGXrAD2yJk

Some 180,000 Jews, iirc, ended up in the NV Transylvania that was occupied (due to Ribentrop-Molotov pact) by Hungary, and were send by Hungarians to nazis death camps in Poland. It is not sure how many Jews ended up in Bessarabia (also occupied by the soviets due to the same pact), how many died during the war and how many were refugees.

The Jews in Bessarabia were treated differently because in 1940 many of them sided with the soviet occupation. In a way, I don't blame them, they thought getting along with the new master might help them, but some go overboard and comitted despicable acts while collaborating with NKVD or during and after Romanian Army retreat. Thats why they were treated so harshly while the ones from   the ""old kingdom"" survived the war just fine. 

About the Iron Guard, there is also some background that due to brainwashing political corectness of history is not very known and discussed. First of all, their ideology was based more on spirituality and ""the soul"" and only after that on blood. For example the wife of one of the most known and beloved Legionaries leaders, Vasile Marin (he and Mota had fought and died in the civil war in Spain, I think they still have a big monument there) had some Jewish origins but she since she was a Christian he had no problem with that, and none of his fellow Legionaries had either.

Also we need to look at the historical context. Romania back then was ruled by a very corrupt and authocratic king, who imposed his own sort of dictatorship, supported by a ""camarila"" of various politicians, businessmen and figures of power (especially from Police and interiour secret service). His mistress has some Jewish origins as well, which didn't sit well with some people opinions in those times 

Since the Legion/Iron Guard was a very noisy critic and a threat to his regime, he acted very harsh against them, up to getting them banned in early 30'. During his reign lots of them were constantly arrested, beaten and tortured, many also killed (they also reacted at some  point by assassinating some prime ministers and ministers close to the king). Toward his late years his regime became even harsher, and his secret police outright assassinated the founder of the Legion/Iron Guard and dozen leaders (strangled to death while in custody), in total thousands of legionars were killed in various ways, in prison, hanged, shot etc. The leader of the women organisation, a girl in her 20's, was arrested, raped, tortured in horrible ways and while barely still alive was tied in a bag in pushed in an oven in the crematory.

All these happened well before the Legionaries rebellion and their short time in power. They were obviously thirsty for revenge and for someone with their beliefs about life and death and honor it was expected to be a bloody one (the king train that was taking him out of the country was riddled with bullets but he escaped) and they did it against anyone they could (including many police and secret police chiefs they could get).

This doesn't excuse the horrible things they did, ofcourse, especially against innocent people (and even more, kids), I feel I need to say this so some people won't interpret it in some wrong way",,/r/europe/comments/bf8d4j/abandoned_and_ruined_ashkenazi_synagogue_in/eld39xq/,duras2,1555782453

4160,"&gt;If you honestly believe that recognition of Kosovo isnt first and major condition from EU to even entertain giving us serious opportunity to join,no offense, you are delusional.

Didn't I mention there are countries in the EU that didn't recognize Kosovo?

&gt;And it does refer to de facto recognition.

That's only your opinion or, to be more exact, a myth spread by the anti-European forces in Serbia, funded by you-know-who.

&gt;You ve got Hungary and Poland now, pissing against the wind. We had UK for how many decades? Former Soviet republics that still dont trust that Western EU will protect them, lobbying for US instead? 

None of them is driven by Russia. You seem to have a skewed notion of what Russia really is and how the EU perceives this country. I know Serbs like painting the US as the Evil Empire but the fact is that the US is not considered a threat or an enemy, especially not the same kind like Russia. It might be an economic competitor, but not an ideological opponent. 

&gt;How many EU countries attended summit with China just a week or so ago? 16?

It wasn't a EU-wide summit. It was meant to include only Central-Eastern European countries and western EU countries were not even invited. I guess the nationalist Serbian media ""forgot"" to mention this ""irrelevant"" fact (probably because the summit was held in Croatia and every opportunity to belittle the achievements of your fellow brothers-in-language is appreciated on Russian-funded sites like Cp6uh.info). 

&gt;So if we let Kosovo go, everything will be fine and dandy?

And if you keep bickering over it, God (who is Serbian) will personally descend on Earth and hand Kosovo over to the Serbian nation. 

Face it, Kosovo is lost for Serbia. Borders in Europe have changed many times, it might be fair or not, but accepting it is the only way to achieve progress. As I said, you can either keep crying or get over it, reform the country, join the EU and let your own people live in better conditions. By refusing to admit it you only harm your own people. I can imagine what Poland would look like had we said in 1990 - ""no, we won't join the EU until Germans pay us reparations we rightfully deserve"". Would it be a reasonable approach? No, in fact only now, when we're getting stronger and our voice is more relevant we can start thinking about calling for justice and make Germans pay. I don't know if we'll succeed or not but certainly we have more chances now that we did 30 years ago when we were an impoverished country that didn't belong to any serious European alliance. 

And I ask you one more time - do you really think Russia will help you to get Kosovo back? Seriously, be honest. 

&gt;Meanwhile every talk of Republika Srpska gets shut down, we are still smeared by US propaganda, called genocidal maniacs etc. Who will guarantee that Albanians wont push North? Who is gonna guarantee for Kosovo Serbs safety? KFOR that watched monasteries burn in 2004? Germany and US that armed and funded KLA during 90'?

And who will do it when Serbia is outside the EU, its voice isn't heard by anyone and because of its hardline nationalist stance on such matters it keeps being a punching bag for staunchly pro-European Albania? Do you really think you're a stronger country outside the most important European organizations? Or maybe you think Russia will help you in any of those?

Most episodes are filmed in some kind of asylum, where these characters are talking a lot, but saying very little. In that asylum, they are not allowed to insult other inmates, so the have created a code. So instead of ""cunt"" or ""idiot"", they use euphemisms like ""Right Honourable"" or ""Honourable and Learned"". That asylum is led by Mr Speaker, who actually seems quite funny.

4229,"Thanks for the downvote.  
Now, let me explain. You said that EU just voted for smarter policies. And providers are at fault for resorting to algorithm. They people who voted w=for those smarter policies are just as innocent when it comes to filter as am I when it comes to murder, I didn't kill anybody, pushing someone from 9th floor doesn't mean killing. If there would be no gravity (or much smaller), something to absorbs the shock, no ground to hit... than that person would still be alive, therefore not my fault. Is exactly the same reasoning.  The providers are liable, they face heavy fines for breaches so their only solution is to curate everything. And that's A LOT. its simply not feasable to do that manually for all that content.  
So just like physics laws (and statistics) guarantees what will happen if I push someone from 9th floor (and why I should be considered a criminal) also logistics of curating huge content makes a direct connection between MEPs, what they voted and filters (run by a better or worse AI) and why are responsible for the filters, even if they didn't directly specified them in the law.

- Two major military losses to the rebels/Russia, complete loss of control over those territories. Five goddamn years of low-intensity warfare.
- Hryvnia went from 8 for a dollar to 27
- Utilities rose so much that an average 50 m^2 apartment costs around $100/month in bills.
- The average salary is around $200 (yeah, compare those two numbers)
- State lost monopoly on violence. When a policeman beats a paramilitary thug, the policeman loses his job. If the thug beats a policeman, he's a hero.
- A coal scheme called Rotterdam+ is instated. The state buys coal for $100/ton, while its real cost is $30/ton and up until 2017 it was extracted from the republics at war with Ukraine. Poroshenko and his buddy Akhmetov directly profit from the taxpayers' money.
- Multiple schemes with the defense budget, recently surfaced
- President makes millions during presidency. Has massive offshore accounts in Panama.
- Multiple bills are passed curtailing the rights of minorities, including Romanians and Hungarians.
- Pensions are on average $30-50/month.
- Anti-corruption entities are gutted and completely ineffective because it would hamper the president's ability to steal.
- President creates an autonomous Ukrainian church, destroying the principle of separation of church and state, and further dividing the country.
- Many other smaller things I can't remember now

There were some positives, like the visa-free travel to Europe, which is hardly his achievement though. In reality though it's simply used for cheap labor by Poland and other neighboring countries.

She said that when he came back he had such a big beard she didn't recognise him and cried because he went to hug her as she was walking home from school - she thought it was a stranger.

4323,"&gt; Not having built them is not the same as not having the know-how.

It's literally what know-how means. Having an understanding of how it works is not ""having the know-how"", you're being absolutely ridiculous now.

&gt; That's a super-questionable statement. You could compare to previous programs sure, but that won't give a particularly accurate picture. It's much more expensive to develop something nobody's ever developed before; then it is to develop something you know is possible and which you understand the physics behind. 

The M51.2 which is the SLBM that is on our nuclear submarines costed 3,5B€ to develop. And it's just an upgrade of the M.51. I'm sorry but you don't have the beginning of a clue of what you're talking about. At all.

&gt; North-Korea has managed to produce an ICBM, and their military budget is compareable to that of the Netherlands

They started their program in 1976 and their top nuclear physicist had a salary of 45US$ a month (watched a Korean movie where it's mentioned just a few days ago). Ridiculous comparison.

&gt; That just demonstrates you don't know what you're talking about. Dutch companies designed and produce most of the solar-panels used in space. Dutch technology and engineering are integral parts of every European rocket. The leading atmospheric sensors for science opreations are Dutch; Dutch-built science equipment can be found in virtually every satellite launched these days, with a wide range of scientific space experiments and projects being Dutch designed/built. And beyond that there's Dutch aerospace production and involvement in everything from high-tech composite materials to electronics and engine-engineering. I could go on. The Dutch Aerospace industry employs a 125.000 people; it is absolutely a huge player; it just isn't widely known by the public.

Fair enough, I'll concede that I didn't know that it was this big. 

&gt; There's nothing impossible about anything talked about here.

Yes it's currently impossible for the Dutch to develop ICBMs within the short time frame you seem you think it's achievable to do so and with this current defence budget.",Moody Parisian,/r/europe/comments/bepxr8/the_netherlands_holds_on_to_nuclear_weapons_the/elcjojy/,Nico2845,1555768352

I have gone through periods (years) of reading and watching WW1&amp;2 media, and watch a ton of fantasy violent films but avoid watching the news or more realistic depictions of violence on TV as I don't like the ""realness"" of them.  I spent about a month solid watching Ben Shapiro (someone extremely right-wing from a European perspective ) videos/podcasts and enjoy listening to him on topics. I mostly don't agree with him on what he says but he is a great communicator and I like seeing how he can take a topic and bend it to his advantage.  I go to 4chan and watch those Nationalist socialist videos, sometimes because they have great music tracks and sometimes because the imagery is fascinating. It doesn't make me a Nazi sympathiser.

You seem to have a bit of a superior attitude about this, and sound like someone scolding a child. If you're basing your assumption that he doesn't understand that ""war is not a game"" on the media he consumes, then the issue is with you.

4425,"&gt; You don't have the know-how, which is the point.

We do. Not having built them is not the same as not having the know-how. The science involved in building such weapons is well-understood. The actual engineering involved is also not especially obscure; and well within local capabilities. It just becomes a matter of actually bringing it all together and develop the practical experience of designing and building them.

&gt; It would take twice your yearly defence budget to develop just ICBMs.

That's a super-questionable statement. You could compare to previous programs sure, but that won't give a particularly accurate picture. It's much more expensive to develop something nobody's ever developed before; then it is to develop something you know is possible and which you understand the physics behind. 

You could compare to current programs; which also doesn't necessarily give an accurate view. North-Korea has managed to produce an ICBM, and their military budget is compareable to that of the Netherlands; they also suffer from sanctions that make sourcing component materials and technologies rather difficult. A hypothetical Dutch ICBM program would not suffer from these issues and one would expect such a program to not cost as much accordingly.

&gt; Also ESA's tech development is nowhere near Dutch because some of it happens to be located there, this is straight delusion.

You're missing the point. The concentration of ESA tech development in the Netherlands means that there's a lot of related *activity* in the Netherlands; both taking part *directly* in the tech development, as well as in a supportive role. There's a bleed-off effect of experience and know-how that happens as a result of these types of high-tech clusters.

And it's not just ESA's presence that produces this effect. The Netherlands is home to many global aerospace companies. There's a large number of specialized facilities for maintenance/repair, training, manufacturing, and logistics that are located here for the global aerospace industry. Furthermore, there's numerous specialized third party local companies that help further facilitate all of these things.

&gt; And no, the Netherlands is not even remotely close to being a ""HUGE"" player in the space industry, seriously.

That just demonstrates you don't know what you're talking about. Dutch companies designed and produce most of the solar-panels used in space. Dutch technology and engineering are integral parts of every European rocket. The leading atmospheric sensors for science opreations are Dutch; Dutch-built science equipment can be found in virtually every satellite launched these days, with a wide range of scientific space experiments and projects being Dutch designed/built. And beyond that there's Dutch aerospace production and involvement in everything from high-tech composite materials to engine-engineering. The Dutch Aerospace industry employs a 125.000 people; it is *absolutely* a huge player; it just isn't widely known by the public.

&gt; but you seem to think your country is capable to do some impossible stuff if it decided too.

Just over a month since the European elections on 26 May and while  the tension between the government allies continues to increase in level, these are the votes of the Italians surveyed by Ipsos for Corriere della Sera and compared with the results obtained by the same institute two weeks ago, when for the first time since the summer  last grillini were seen in recovery.  The survey signed by Nando Pagnoncelli, which gives the Northern League a lot more than what emerged from the Emgdi survey two days before, was carried out before the news of the corruption investigation involving the under-secretary League armando Siri came out.  The consensus for the government remains high, at 52%.

 &gt;The deputy prime minister Matteo Salvini's party is also in the lead for ""voting fidelity"": 87% of those who voted for the 4 March policies intend to confirm the choice.  High, says Pagnoncelli, also confidence in the leader: 49.9%, second only to Prime Minister Conte.  And almost 9 leaguers out of 10 are sure of their party's victory at the European Championships.  The M5s instead settles just over 22% after the recovery set two weeks ago and according to the analysis of the flows 52% of those who voted M5s in 2018 would confirm their vote, while one out of four would abstain and 18% would prefer the  Alloy.

 &gt;The Pd of the new secretary Zingaretti is in decline, but without strong repercussions from the investigation into the health of Umbria which resulted in the resignation of president Catiuscia Marini.  According to Pagnoncelli the dems particularly need to ""re-motivate the only electorate, among the first four political forces, resigned to the success of others: infactis a voter out of four thinks that the Pd will affirm itself while 45% forecast the victory of the League"".

&gt;Forza Italia still loses ground in favor of Salvini's party, which would be voted by 33% of those who chose Fi in 2018. The fidelity of the vote to Berlusconi's party drops to 44%.  In any case, however, the majority of voters who intend to vote for Forza Italia at the Europeans bet on the victory of their party.  According to Ipsos, the explanation is that the former Knight's candidacy galvanizes the devoted electorate, but he struggles to attract new voters.",Italia,/r/europe/comments/bfbeyj/italian_poll_for_the_european_elections_lega/elcc08t/,FrankCesco,1555761318

4434,"&gt; supply that information to government agencies or, in some cases, to private persons in cases of insult or defamation

In cases of insult or defamation that are going before the courts. That's a bit different from making it sound like any user just casually asking about another poster's ID solely because they feel insulted.

&gt; With stories like this one, we certainly don't need to make it easier for those who are willing and able to abuse their position.

That's a whole other issue. The police and other government agencies are going to have your address anyways. And let's be honest -- they kinda have to in order to do their job. In my opinion, the solution to the issue you've pointed out is not to take away the state's knowledge of your address, but to crack down on internal abuse.

&gt; But it's not all about racist remarks or threats. There are also things like talking about intimate matters, ""confessing"" embarrasing stories, and the good ol' speaking truth to power. None of these would be illegal, but they offer actual advantages for a society and yet, these users still have a legitimate interest in staying anonymous.

Under what circumstances exactly would a user confessing embarrassing stories or speaking truth to power, which you yourself pointed out would not be illegal, trigger a request for the user's data that is explicitly referred to as ""Aufklärung des
konkreten Verdachts einer durch den Inhalt eines Postings begangenen Straftat des Posters"", an investigation into a suspected criminal act?

And people choose their audience in the internet as well. Anything you post *publicly*, like here on reddit, is addressed to the public in general, exactly the same as if you'd step up on a box on the street. If you want to talk *privately*, that's where private messages, queries, and whatever come into play, which would limit exposure of your talk to the individuals you want to chat with.

When you remove the constraints on communication put into place by human social behavior by artificially lowering accountability, yeah, maybe you do get a ""more honest mirror of society"" than on the streets. You also get a radicalized and polarized society with unbridled hate speech, death threats and sexist or racist bullying because trolls can get away with it. This is a downward spiral away from civil discourse, and looking back over my past two decades of experience in the internet, I do perceive a notable shift in how people talk with each other.

These effects are no longer confined to the internet, as an entire generation of kids is growing up in a world where, thanks to their exposure to the web, they learn that it's okay to treat others like shit. But it's the web where it started, so taking it out of the equation just seems a bit naive.

&gt; It was always a flawed, a phony way, to express oneself. It is incomplete, so why should it be the only way to communicate?

It's the exact opposite. Human social nature is based on face-to-face contact and the ability to feel shame when we are held accountable for the shit we do. This is currently being stripped by means of technology, and it shows when we look at how society is beginning to turn onto itself right now. How many violent acts could have been avoided if the perpetrators had not become radicalized via social media echo chambers and fake news?",Europe,/r/europe/comments/bexqr8/austrian_government_seeks_to_eliminate_internet/elcc2ef/,akashisenpai,1555761373

Going from say Maryland or Masechussets to Louisiana or Texas, the difference in culture is night and day. Sure, the states that were populated largely after the USA formed are more homogenously ""American"", but I don't think this would apply to Europe since we already have such rich and varied culture everywhere.

I genuinely haven't seen anyone suggesting that a Federal Europe should aim to make a uniform culture across Europe, it's something that's always raised as a point against it.

So if creole culture is still alive and well in Louisiana 216 years after the US bought it from France, I don't see a reason to believe the same wouldn't be the case with a Federal Europe.

It's worth noting though that some cultural values are already being lost as countries all over move towards urbanisation and this would continue to happen independent of whether or not the EU federalises, but pooling our resources towards a common foreign policy, fiscal integration, and defence shouldn't affect the internal and cultural organisation of the individual states.",,/r/europe/comments/bf4mfu/your_thoughts_about_the_idea_of_united_states_of/elcczcr/,trifleMap,1555762309

4572,"Translation:

&amp;#x200B;

 The address of Vox addresses in 14 pages the commandments to be followed by those responsible for communication of their provincial delegations. Among the measures that are proposed is to reject interviews of media with little affinity and stop serving journalists who wish to ""carry out malicious information"". These guidelines for action, which has been accessed by eldiario.es, establish that official accounts on social networks are prohibited from responding to journalists or other parties without authorization from the National Deputy Secretary of Communication and that their managers have to send to the headquarters the password of the account.  

&amp;#x200B;

In relation to the messages that these profiles must broadcast, they point out that they can not ""position themselves on national issues in which the party has not yet manifested"" and that the most advisable is to ""adapt the speech of Vox to the province or municipality"" . 

""Example: if we want to complain about the state of paving of a street, we relate it to the use of public money for purposes that do not interest the citizens of our municipality: subsidies to separatist parties, to radical feminist organizations,"" they explain in the text entitled 'Communication Manual' and who has agreed to this wording.  

&amp;#x200B;

 As stated in the text, this is the first edition of this document. Sources consulted by this editorial explain that it was distributed in January, after the electoral success of the Andalusian elections. Among the indications included, they maintain a policy similar to that of Trump or Bolsonaro focused on not responding to requests for information from critical media.  Following these guidelines of action, this week the communication direction of the party decided to start a purge of journalists in the WhatsApp group that uses as the only channel to provide information. 

&amp;#x200B;

Vox threw first the informants who published a news about the content of a message sent by mistake the Deputy Secretary of Communication, Manuel Mariscal, in which they recognized that their expulsion from the electoral debate of Atresmedia was good for them, despite the fact that Santiago Abascal and other party leaders lamented that resolution in public.",,/r/europe/comments/bfamy3/vox_communication_manual_to_complain_about_the/elc60wz/,Tavirio,1555754337

I do not want the legal parameters of my life being defined by people who have never been to my country, let alone near it, who do not understand how the decisions they make will alter how I am able to live.

I also see significant scope for an oppressive European state to emerge as a consequence of centralisation. A Europe of broadly autonomous countries, cooperating voluntarily, is to me a much healthier and robust ""distributed system"". The idea of a former country being overruled by simple majority on an issue they find intensely important would be a catalyst to destroying the entire union. The more the EU is overloaded the greater the chance of the whole thing crashing down, which I do not want.

I think federalists risk the collapse of the entire institution by pressing forward against all criticism or reasoned opposition.

&gt; That's it. Democrats lost.

See, thats what you dont get. That wasnt a Democrat play. The Special Counsel investigation was authorized by Rod Rosenstein (R), a member of the Trump (R) administration. The reason for the Special Counsel Investigation was: the following:

&gt; The Russian government interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election with the goal of harming the campaign of Hillary Clinton, boosting the candidacy of Donald Trump, and increasing political discord in the United States. Russia's covert activities were first publicly disclosed by members of the United States Congress on September 22, 2016, confirmed by the United States Intelligence Community on October 7, 2016, and further detailed by the Director of National Intelligence office three months later. According to U.S. intelligence agencies, the operation was ordered directly by Russian President Vladimir Putin.

So, thats that.

Now about the report. The report cleary confirms everything the United States Intelligence Community stated about the Russian influence on the election. It also says that Trump was not working with the Russian, thats right. Sadly for Trump the report also explains that he never had a chance to even try to work with the Russian because he does not understand whats going on.

So congratulations. Your President is not a traitor, he is just a 
simpleton who got played by Putin. Big win for you.

&gt; but you guys are so full of yourselves, you don't realize you just continue to dig your own grave

Artifices need an interpreters, and what they do is dependent on how one reads the artificial features. Because intelligence requires final causality and artifices have no final causality, ""artificial intelligence"" is an oxymoron.  


This is contrasted by how a cat sees. A cat sees even if nobody is there to interpret the cat's action of seeing. A cat sees even if the cat is unaware of its own action of seeing (e.g. peripheral vision). This is also contrasted by how an acorn grows into an oak tree. The acorn has an inherent telos toward growing into an oak tree, and this telos is a law of objective reality.

4870,"The law isn't just about ""authorities"", whoever that would be anyways:

&gt; users will have to provide their first name, last name and address to platform operators. In the event of an investigation, operators would then have to supply that information to government agencies or, in some cases, to private persons in cases of insult or defamation. 

That's way too many levels on which leaks can occur and your name can be available without any oversight. With stories like [this one](https://www.fr.de/rhein-main/daten-illegal-abgerufen-11740891.html), we certainly don't need to make it easier for those who are willing and able to abuse their position.

You seem to have a certain demographic group with a certain behaviour in mind when making your argument. But it's not all about racist remarks or threats. There are also things like talking about intimate matters, ""confessing"" embarrasing stories, and the good ol' speaking truth to power. None of these would be illegal, but they offer actual advantages for a society and yet, these users still have a legitimate interest in staying anonymous.

The comparison you make by saying ""as in real life, so in the internet"", is a flawed one. In real life, people choose their audience, and just because someone has enough wits to not slander a prosecutor to his face doesn't mean that this model of communication would be somehow the holy grail of societal conversation.

The internet in this regard is the opposite, a complimentary tool of communication. And the conversation online is in many ways a more honest mirror of society than what we get from looking at ""street life"". That alone is a good enough reason to keep the anonymity intact.

Yes, it is new. But the old mechanics of street-level communication with an open visor are still in place and working. It was always a flawed, a phony way, to express oneself.

4883,"This goes one level deeper than the frame problem. The frame problem accepts \*\*as a presupposition\*\* that all computation is artificial and so is meaningless without an assigned interpretation. Solving the frame problem would only give you a way to decide which interpretation is best, but no interpretation would make the computation objectively meaningful. That being an artifice is intrinsic to computation the frame problem has as its first presupposition. The frame problem is about coming up with a system to interpret actions that are not guided by laws of objective reality (they \*\*supervene\*\* upon the laws of physics, but they themselves aren't guided by any laws of objective reality), but rather human artifices.  


Meanwhile animal vision has no frame problem, because animal vision is a law of objective reality in addition to supervening on the laws of biology, chemistry, physics, etc.... These laws of objective reality that supervene on the laws of physics are called ""final causes.""  


&gt;You’ve done it as a human being.

Pretty much from the 13th century when we were conquered in the Livonian Crusade (before which we were tribal) until the beginning of the 19th century around when serfdom was abolished so basically native Estonians &amp; Latvians were slaves/serfs under German nobility for over 600 years. They fully lost their class privileges and their land was expropriated around 1919.

&gt; Did the orders heavily mix in with the local and they became Estonian-ised/Latvianised etc.

Until 19th century and perhaps even later that almost never happened and if any Latvian or Estonian managed to rise above their class then they were expected to Germanize (assimilate into German culture, adopt their language, customs, and German family names after which they were considered Germans) and to forget their roots and not vice versa.",Estonia|UK,/r/europe/comments/bf0wkz/the_word_for_night_in_different_european_languages/elb44ng/,ronrein,1555717927

The debt OBLIGATION was from 120 years ago, but it was being paid for 80 years (up until less than 40 years ago). Germany's reparations obligations stem from less than 75 years ago, and payment was to commence upon reunification.

&gt;Since we are talking about 200m EUR in 2010, I am sure something like this could be paid.

What relevance is the amount of the obligation? Germany was paying for WW1 reparations up until 2010. It can certainly pay those of WW2 regardless of the amount. The issue here is that Germany does not want to pay **anything**.

For the record, I would not want Germany to pay anything to the corrupt Greek state. They should however pay reparations to the central bank (for the forced loan), and to individuals and companies that had their assets or lives destroyed during the war/occupation. I would much rather see reparations in the form of museums in both Germany and Greece that present the crimes committed by the Nazis against the Greek population.",,/r/europe/comments/bec5du/greek_parliament_to_discuss_and_vote_on_war/elb46lc/,GeorgePapadopoulos,1555717968

5087,"&gt;So it's your typical ""We had to suffer, now you have to suffer as well.""

Umm.. that is literally the definition of reparations.

""the making of amends for a wrong one has done, by paying money to or otherwise helping those who have been wronged.""

Now if you wish to equate actual suffering (murdering Greek civilians and destroying the country) with having Germans today pay compensation, feel free to keep making that argument.

&gt;if Germany had to pay reparations, they won't be able to do crucial investments

What ""crucial investments"" has Germany made in Greece? Obviously the country is run by career criminals (who bear the vast majority of the blame), but they have been enabled to a large extent by the German state and private businesses (almost every significant case of corruption in Greece involves German companies which are protected by the German state - example: [Siemens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siemens_Greek_bribery_scandal), and Germany's protection of Christoforakos &amp; others).

&gt;France or the Netherlands could have chosen to pluck Germany after WW2. They didn't.

Neither did Greece, in case you're wondering. The [1953 London Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Agreement_on_German_External_Debts) included Greece.

In case you haven't bothered reading the agreement, this is what was to transpire after the 1990 unification of Germany

&gt;Article 25  
&gt;  
&gt;Action on reunification of Germany  
&gt;  
&gt;**The parties to the present Agreement will review the present Agreement on the reunification of Germany** exclusively for the purpose of-  
&gt;  
&gt;(a) **implementing the provisions** of the Annexes to the present Agreement regarding adjustments to be made in respect of **specific debts upon such reunification**, except in so far as such provisions are to become automatically operative upon that event

When was Greece (as a party to the 1953 agreement) asked to review and/or implement the provisions on the debt obligations? Certainly the ""[Two Plus Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_on_the_Final_Settlement_with_Respect_to_Germany)"" treaty does not address the German obligations that stem from the 1953 agreement. Legally, Germany is screwed which is why they'd rather intimidate/buy pathetic ""politicians"" using ""diplomacy"".",,/r/europe/comments/bec5du/greek_parliament_to_discuss_and_vote_on_war/elb5kna/,GeorgePapadopoulos,1555719070

5134,"\&gt;\[CITATION NEEDED\]

Read the Directive, it's very clear.

\&gt; So a website has to get deals with every movie, TV, Music, game, photographer studio on the planet on the chance someone uploads an image or other related material to the site? That is not reasonable. 

Indeed, that is not reasonable, and that is also not what is in the Directive. Read it.

\&gt;  So larger website admins/owners are now going to have to spend most of their time dealing with copyright claims and threats of legal action? 

Nope.

\&gt; I presented this option and literally one comment ago you replied ""you comply with Article 13 by doing none of that"". Now you're saying you do it? 

I was talking about the 99% of websites who have nothing to do with this. The websites that do, do not need to do anything unless they are making money off of other people's content.

\&gt;  The article calls for sites to make their ""best effort"", this is intentionally vague and whether or not the judge sides with the Website owner really depends on his understanding or his mood. It's not unreasonable to believe a judge might believe a site is not making its ""best effort"" to prevent these things happening if they're in court dozens, even hundreds of times.

5171,"&gt; I remember having read that only 25% of the French population spoke French at the time of the French Revolution.

The North was more populous and most of the population spoke French, albeit dialectal forms of it rather than literary French.

National policies acted as a catalyst but most of the work was done organically though the Army, industrialization and the massive social and geographical mobility thereof. People just didn't see the benefit in their languages so they left them by the wayside, I've seen it happen in my own family. Same as people now are transitioning to English. Reactionary behaviour came from later generations that would rather blame the government than their ancestors (because the cult of tradition and ancestry quickly crumbles when you actually know your ancestors). Same goes for most countries really.

*Although*, irrespective of this proposed legislation, I do think general disclosure of personal identity on the web would help improve public discourse, specifically because often, fear of repercussions is what's keeping people in general from behaving like dicks. Many humans don't operate on empathy alone, but refrain from shitty behavior because they've got a name and reputation to lose. And online, we can see what happens once you remove this inherent social safeguard called ""shame"".

Our society is based to a large degree on how we behave when facing one another, and the internet changes this. I don't think this change is an improvement. If some people fear they can't discuss politics ""on the street"" for fear of repercussion, then (a) the situation on the street should be improved and/or (b) maybe there's a good reason why they feel their opinion can only be expressed in shadowy circles where it can't be attached to their public face.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/bexqr8/austrian_government_seeks_to_eliminate_internet/elauykf/,akashisenpai,1555710803

5251,"&gt;A three-dimensional, lifelike reconstruction of Julius Caesar’s head reveals what the famous Roman leader likely looked like during his lifetime, including the odd proportions of his head.  
&gt;
&gt;The ruler’s depiction was unveiled during an event last week at the National Museum of Antiquities in Leiden, the Netherlands, to promote archeologist Tom Buijtendorp’s new book. Teaming up with archaeologist and physical anthropologist Maja d’Hollosy, the duo took 3D scans of two ancient marble busts depicting the general. Portraits taken from Roman coins were also used to fill in missing pieces of Caesar’s features, like his nose and ears. After the scans, d’Hollosy used clay and silicone to give him a face complete with nearly black eyes, salt-and-pepper locks, and a receding hairline.
&gt;
&gt;“I [did] not let him look happy and friendly. He was a general who was about corpses,” d'Hollosy, who specializes in facial reconstruction, told Dutch newspaper HLN.
&gt;
&gt;The reconstruction also shows a “crazy bulge” on Caesar’s head. Exactly why his head takes this unusual shape remains a bit of a mystery. It was long-believed Caesar was born via C-section, but that rumor has been relatively squashed. C-sections were only performed on dead or dying mothers during childbirth and there are many accounts of Caesar’s mother Aurelia being alive into his adulthood. 
&gt;
&gt;Cranial abnormalities, on the other hand, can be quite common. A newborn’s skull is highly malleable. During childbirth, any force applied to a baby’s head can result in “dramatic distortions”. Oftentimes, these deformations will return to normal in a short period of time, but if left untreated can result in permanent changes to a child’s skull.  
&gt;
&gt;There are historical accounts of early humans reshaping their children’s skulls around the world, from Central America to Europe to Asia. Archaeologists involved in the reconstruction believe Caesar’s deformed head was probably the result of natural causes. 
&gt;
&gt;“A doctor said that such a thing occurs in a heavy delivery. You do not invent that as an artist. And realistic portraits were in fashion,” said Buijtendorp.
&gt;
&gt;The bust is on display at the museum until August.",SUSSCABUS,/r/europe/comments/bf3gx2/3d_reconstruction_of_julius_caesars_head_reveals/elakgau/,Benjamin-Cat,1555703441

5507,"The wheelbase is the same, those 5 mm can easily be changed from a slightly different suspension setup (at least from the pictures the Vesta seems to have an even higher ride height). The width is also the same, make a more flared wheel arch and presto it's 2 cm wider. Like I said, if you want to identify the same chassis, the easiest way is to look at the A, B and C pillars (and consequently the windshield and roof which if you look at it carefully they are identical) because those are part of the safety cell and it costs an arm and a leg to redesign those. Also suspension and suspension mounts, the back suspension is identical, and the front suspension is also the same, they just added a bit of plastic on the Vesta to cover the front suspension mounts. It also has the same 4 lug nuts wheels typical of the Logan range. The only difference is the front end looks somewhat longer, probably to make it longer and more upmarket.

5598,"&gt; thats also why they try to diversify the population because they know different groups will never see eachother as ""one of their own""

As far as I can see, attempts to keep the people in a single country neatly segregated into groups predominantly come from a specific political direction, not the general populace per se, and its influencers are pushing for this ""us vs them"" narrative because they benefit from the distraction.

They'd also keep doing so even when you remove whatever groups are currently presented as scapegoats, because there will *always* be a minority that is somehow different. If they're not going for the Muslims, they'll go for the Jews or the gays again. And when those are no longer around, they'll probably go for people with red hair.

You've misunderstood the very concept of tribalism. Tribalism isn't ""everyone coming together fighting the very rich"" -- that would be socialism, from *society*. Tribalism is the opposite of ""everyone"", namely mankind splitting up into smaller groups, several *tribes*, fighting one another.

In the political context, ""tribe"" and ""society"" are not interchangeable words, they mean different things.

The solution to the problem is to not opt into tribalism, and refrain from putting people into neatly pre-labeled boxes for easier application of prejudice.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/bew1ey/notredame_raises_16_times_more_donations_than/el9bw6t/,akashisenpai,1555674173

5637,"From https://definitions.uslegal.com/s/sealed-indictment/ :

""It is the grand jury's determination that there is enough evidence that the defendant committed the crime to justify having a trial voted by a grand jury. In order to issue an indictment, the grand jury doesn't make a determination of guilt, but only the probability that a crime was committed, that the accused person did it and that he/she should be tried. District Attorneys do not present a full case to the grand jury, but often only introduce key facts sufficient to show the probability that the accused committed a crime."" 

From wikipédia :
A common definition is ""a reasonable amount of suspicion, supported by circumstances sufficiently strong to justify a prudent and cautious person's belief that certain facts are probably true"".[5] Notable in this definition is a lack of requirement for public position or public authority of the individual making the recognition, allowing for use of the term by citizens and/or the general public. The definition of probable cause is, “(A) reasonable ground for supposing that a charge is well-founded” (Merriam-Webster, 2019).

Man you are the one not undestanding. You don't need définitive proof to start a trial. Müller didn't establish with définitive proof that there was a conspiracy, but his investigation apparently brings a lot of évidence toward this fact. An official  indictement would give more judicial power to an investigation to find out the truth. Now we will see if something will come from that. Maybe not, because it seems Barr will try to block anything ?

But at the same time, we didn't make ourselves. Insofar we make choices, we didn't make the capabilities to make the choices we can make, and so on. That's the basis for, say, solidarity with people who through no fault of their own are handicapped or have diseases, widows, what have you. If the ""playing field"" was level, if we made our fate, it would be different. I know I expressed it very stupidly, but it's like anyone is actually trying to follow along so fuck it.

We don't just ""invest"" (I don't mean money, I mean just people not getting their knickers in a twist like they did here would be a start lol) into solidarity and empathy to get immediate return, but to keep the the principles themselves alive, too. I mean sure, let's say fuck everyone else who isn't of benefit to us directly... let that trickle into people for a few decades, end up elderly and not that rich -- good luck with that! And frankly, even more generally, it really does the brain good. People are squeamish about mental muscles they're not using.

&gt; So the only definition of culture is how much we spend helping other people? Huh?

I wasn't offering a definition of culture, I was being snarky. Here's another way to express the same sentiment in more words, just because I know people will love it:

&gt; *Ah, yeah. We're gonna go to Mars. And then of course we're gonna colonize deep space. With our microwave hot dogs and plastic vomit, fake dog shit and cinnamon dental floss, lemon-scented toilet paper and sneakers with lights in the heels. And all these other impressive things we've done down here. But let me ask you this: what are we gonna tell the intergalactic council of ministers the first time one of our teenage mothers throws their newborn baby into a dumpster? How are we gonna explain that to the space people? How are we gonna let them know that our ambassador was only late for the meeting because his breakfast was cold and he had to spend half an hour punching his wife around the kitchen? And what are they gonna think when they find out, its just a local custom, that over 80 million women in the Third world have had their clitorises forcibly removed in order to reduce their sexual pleasure so they won't cheat on their husbands? Can't you just sense how eager the rest of the universe is for us to show up?*

It's a Jewel of Christianity, it's Easter, and there's a bunch of quotes by Jesus that come to mind.

&gt; Even in natural disaster, Europe and the wealthier west cannot be expected to just bail Africa out of its problems over and over. Given what you're suggesting,

What *am* I suggesting? Let's review what I actually said, right?

- there is a human connection, by default [for people not raised in a barn, anyway]

- for many people, the various achievements of European thinkers throughout the centuries are a part of the tradition of Europe

- many fundamental ideas of that culture and tradition however are not exclusive to Europe (like ""the golden rule"" to name a classic)

- that after world war 2, the total destruction and the living memory of tens of millions people dying gruesomly, many of these ideas were recognized and affirmed as more important than ever

- the world is interconnected [and I would add that we can take the environment and arms exports etc. more seriously today, at comparatevly little cost, or in 50-100 years it will be infinitely more expensive, if not impossible, to avert global catastrophes and wars also reaching into Europe, too, so even from a purely selfish perspective it's a bad idea]

That's what I actually said, but none of that translates into any and all extremes of ""bailing out"" others. ""Given what I'm suggesting"", pffff.

&gt; the poor and corrupt situation that foreign countries find themselves in
