The EU is ramping up pressure on Google, Facebook, Amazon etc, and London is clearly also a major facilitator, and money laundering Hotspot, no doubt about it. I think we'll see increased scrutiny in this regard. Who knows how this will affect relationships.

The interesting thing about it is that Brexit genuinely would have never seen the light of day if it were not for Germany and France trying to push through the Financial Transaction Tax, because we all know who that tax was designed for lol.  


That really ruffled a lot of feathers at home though, and what pushed a lot of people in the party to demand a referendum, something which other groups had been wanting the entire time (as I think was quite evident from the voting habit from the older generations).  
Cameron got them to compromise on the basis that if the EU would be open to reform and address underlying problems, then they would drop it - but if not, then a referendum is presented to the population and we go from there. I just think that some on the continent heavily misconstrued how stubborn Brits are if I'm being honest lol.  
Labour had a lot of problems over the years, their biggest downfall though was the actions of Corbyn regarding the Salisbury incident with Russia. With that, it was always going to be a significant Conservative win, even when all the other parties tried to work together by standing down in different areas to push their vote share higher.  


My only concern is that the same mistake is going to happen again, where the EU think that suddenly we're going to blink on everything and give in to all the demands. It's not going to happen now, the majority in the Commons is far too big for even little rebellions to sway any decision... And I hope that they realise that those in government genuinely would welcome a 'no deal' break if it comes to that, though I suspect that reality is perhaps starting to sink in now, albeit late.  


I can see taxes going down in the UK though. We raise a lot more capital the lower the tax is here, specifically corporate tax. Even when May was party leader, they were all in favour of dropping them to turbo charge the economy and attract business by dropping taxes down to 10%. Lower taxes = attracts employers = more jobs = more people with wages = consumer spending = healthy economy.

But you take for granted at least some degree of productive cooperation. That might not materialize.

And rhetoric here on the continent is ramping up too, obv more in regards to China, Russia, Turkey and so forth, but we can't disregard the very real possibility that relations deteriorate to a point where you see such measures on a larger scale, incl. against the UK. 

If the UK is growing more prosperous after brexit itd be a catastrophe for the EU establishment, it could have all sorts of rather serious downstream effects. That's why they make it hard for the UK, they need them to fail.

However, there is a very small minority of Islamists whom everyone else (including some Islamists too) considers deluded and ""dishonorable"" who support not Turkey as such, but Erdogan, as the sword of Islam and that sort of thing.

I've worked in this sector for over 10 years, mostly in London. Putting all the theatrics to one side for a moment, the infrastructure required for this sector isn't something that can be achieved overnight. You need special cabling connecting you to other centres around the world for transmitting secure information, et al.  


I think it's also worth considering how the Euro raises capital and clears it - which is mostly done in London (by mostly, I mean almost all lol). Sterling has been the safeguard for FDI against the Euro this whole time, but given the new circumstances we will be in come the following year, that will obviously be very different.  


There's a lot of speculation over what sectors will be in danger and what not, but genuinely the financial services sector in London will not be going anywhere. EU companies will be allowed to operate in London post-Brexit whatever happens, because the EU relies on London to clear their raised capital.  


Alternatively, the EU could disallow any EU company from operating in London, but then they're not going to have the means to clear the capital they raise - meaning that their coronavirus relief fund will need to be acquired by alternative means, such as direct taxes.  


The EU trying to compete with London on finance is like London trying to compete with Germany on cars. The disparity is simply far too wide to achieve. That's the reality to be honest.",,/r/europe/comments/j35ci2/brexit_eu_launches_legal_action_against_uk_for/g7md2hz/,JustJamesy,1601787814

344,"Sorry, but I think you've all missed the point lol.

Referendums in the UK are not 'legal', they are 'advisory'. Only the actions of parliament (for clarity, I mean the UK parliament) are 'legal' in the UK.

Though in Scotland they call themselves the 'Scottish Government', the name is simply ceremonial. They are a localised devolved power, much like the north west of England, or the assembly in Northern Ireland.

Thus, the only way for Scottish independence to ever be deemed 'legal', is for the UK parliament to agree to it and recognise it - and most crucially, legislate to that effect.  


So with that in mind, it's important to pay careful attention to the words used: ""we will support it as long as it's **legal**"" - which will literally never happen because it is impossible for a referendum at UK level to be legal, unless the UK parliament first legislates to that effect (which, also, is never going to happen lol).

443,"&gt; Is this some sort of prejudice you have? 

More like *post*judice. It's a recurring experience. Lolberts in developed countries like Germany or even the US will concede that other economic systems will not bring total ruin, but will still maintain that there is room for optimisation. But none of this black-and-white crap that you get from lolberts in places like Argentina, Albania etc. 

&gt; And? That's not socialism. There are very specific sets of policies that make Scandinavian countries continuously deliver good living standards. 

No, it's not socialism, but it's definitely not a very capitalistic society. It's social-democracy, with heavy state involvement. We also forget that while the Scandinavia is more soc-dem now and less socialist, during the 1930-1970 development phase they were extremely socialist. Yet that did not prevent them from getting rich. The argument from lolberts is that socialism always leads to ruin. Evidently did not for the Scandis. This is the kind of ideological blinkers I referred to.

I am also unpersuaded that a return to a more socialist model would harm them. What has happened since the 1980s is merely that neoliberalism came into vogue because rich elites pushed for it.

&gt; Elaborate please.

There's not much to be said other than to conclude that institutional economics is an important aspect of understanding what factors make a country rich. Taxation is a second-order issue at best. You can have low taxes but still be a deeply corrupt society with tons of oligarchs taking huge extractive rents (classic example is Russia). You can also have high taxes but where the majority of the corruption happens in the state, because that is where the rent-seeking opportunities will be in such a system.

Ergo, it is foolish mistake to obsess over the size of the state or how much taxation there to understand why some countries fail and some don't. A country with a good set of institutions can succeed in both models and a country with bad institutions will fail no matter which policies it chooses.",,/r/europe/comments/j4b1mq/kalinin_prospekt_moscow_ussr_1977/g7lt95w/,yuropemodssuck,1601780450

Belarus and Russia are much closer to Germany and have a much bigger impact on German national security, as well as the national security of Poland and the Baltics.

The Belarus situation is more likely to push Poland towards the United States, while a EU friendly Belarus would alleviate much of the pressure of having Russian forces possibly appearing on two flanks for Poland.

You also forget a few European nations produced Golden Age stars still remembered by not just hardcore film buffs but even more casual fans of classic cinema are aware of (some even  seen by a fair number of non-Golden Age Hollywood fans)? Marlene Dietrich and Greto Garbo take up the AFI's greatest movie stars of all time ( Dietrich managed to even beat Sophia Loren by a large gap and enter top 10).  Of the non-English origin stars other than Loren, Ingrid Bergman is easily the most famous with many of her films like Casablanca still frequently seen by the general non-movie buff public and she made it top 5 in AFI's rankings.

If we want to get nitpicky, Audrey Hepburn is half Dutch and grew up talking in Dutch and in the Netherlands for a significant part of her life (her first movie was a Dutch language one with English thrown in meant to be educational about basic Dutch culture).

You also underestimate Sophia Loren's acting prowess. She was the first actress and still remains the one of only two actress to win Academy Award for Best Actress despite being in a foreign language film. You only seem to know Loren from her brainless action and chickflick films but her early roles were critically acclaimed and she even got as second Oscar nomination for best actress.

584,"Thanks for the documentary, I just finished watching it.

I don't think there is any conflict or war (with ground forces) where the casualties and suffering is something that happens on just one of the sides. If you have a war or conflict it is inevitable that to a greater or lesser degree both sides will be affected. This however doesn't mean that there is no right and wrong.

In this case, after reading several resources (including the documentary you mentioned) I didn't see any valid reason why Nagorno-Karabakh should be part of  Azerbaijan and not part of Armenia, since historically the great majority of the native population of Nagorno-Karabakh has been Armenians, and not  Azerbaijanis.

The obvious solution would have been for Nagorno-Karabakh to be part of Armenia, and if that happened from the beginning then there would have been no conflict and no suffering for anybody.

Today we can't bring back the dead, but the obvious solution is still the same: Nagorno-Karabakh to be part of Armenia, and the Armenians to return the Azerbaijani territories they occupy to Azerbaijan.",,/r/europe/comments/j4fy3v/the_eu_is_azerbaijans_main_trading_partner/g7lagln/,Ozyzen,1601774008

597,"&gt;Both sides have claims and both sides lack proof. There is absolutely no proof whatsoever, it's Armenia's word against Azerbaijan's, according to your source.

Fair one.

&gt;Armenian Genocide didn't happen in Nagorno Karabakh which Armenia and Azerbaijan are fighting over.

&gt;You are confusing me by being this much brainwashed. By your logic Armenia should attack eastern Turkey, deport locals to west, because the 'region is historically' Armenian. Your 'history' argument has no value in an international sense.

Again, you're not reading what I am saying. I am just explaining the mentality of the Armenians in this conflict. Where did I advocate for anything? I literally said that in the message. Strawmen argument number 1

&gt;No country recognised the vote for their independence. Similar to how Iraqi Kurdistan did the same 'vote by independence' thing and no country recognised it. Stop using the vote as a reason to deport the significant minority of Azerbaijanis.

Again with your logic. Where did I use this as reason to deport Azerbaijan people? Where? When? Strawman argument number 2

It wasn't recognized because it was a geopolitical issue. The same reason even Armenia hasn't recognized it. Because if Russia, France and Armenia did, it would be full-scale war. That doesn't reduce their rights to autonomy any less. The same as it doesn't reduce the Azerbaijani's right to their lands any less.

&gt;I don't agree, why? Because taking the lands forcefully wouldn't do anything good to Armenian and Azerbaijani rights as minorities in their respective communities. You gain rights by progressivism and although it is a hard process that takes ages, it eventually creates a safe relationship between the two ethnic groups.

As you corrected me above. We don't know who attacked first. That would change things if we did. I agree, it should be through diplomatic means with negotiations. Only young soldiers and civilians will die on both sides.

&gt;Armenia today occupies other Azerbaijani areas that have never voted for anything, where the majority is Azerbaijani. You stated later that you don't support it, great. But now it cancels these. Had Armenia never occupied Azerbaijani lands around Nagorno-Karabakh, that would actually be a considerable argument. But considering the reality, that just makes you a hypocrite.

A hypocrite in this situation if I didn't agree with these areas having right to being a part of Azerbaijan. I agree they should be. These lands are separate to Artsakh. 

I think those lands should be Azerbaijan and Artsakh should be Armenian.

Same with Hong Kong and Catolonia

&gt;Armenia can't let them anymore, as they've all been deported or killed. There's been a lot of water under the bridge for your claims to be considerable. The area has already been ethnically cleansed.

I don't agree with that. I dont think the innocent Azeribaijani people there should have been displaced. I am not sure if they were ""ethnically cleansed"", the previous report talks about the blockade meant they were not able to live there anymore due to not getting resources. However, I am sure some were told or advised to leave.

&gt;I'm literally trying to say that Azerbaijani was/is also at fault and cited the link since I think it represents how conflicts cause both sides to disobey human rights. I'm not pro-war, according to UN, Armenia is the invader as I've cited it before, and it demands Armenia should stop occupying Azerbaijani land. According to UN, Armenia is pro-war. What you did is cherrypicking the parts where Azerbaijan is the antagonist.

There is no innocents in war, I agree.

Where does the UN say that? Artsakh is Artsakh land. They have been autonomous prior to Azerbaijan being a nation and the people identify as Armenian. Being a part of Azerbaijan land is a technicality due to the Soviet times. Stalin was a smart man. It really did cause people to divide and be conquered easily. Imagine if all the countries in the region got along peacefully? Georgians, Armenians, Azeri's, Turks, etc. I wonder how much influence Russia would have in the region then?

It is very beneficial for Russia to sell weapons to both sides, which they do to fuel the war. It also means the destabilization so Russians can gain influence in the region. 

When I was in Azerbaijan and talking with the guide who fought in the NK war, he told us that we should be happy Russia is not our neighbor. As time goes on I agree with him more and more.",,/r/europe/comments/j3yktz/azerbaijan_fires_ballistic_missiles_possibly_also/g7ld20p/,Dackant,1601774992

Prior to the Soviet decision the region came under the control of the Soviet Azerbaijan SSR, through the then recent Nagorno-Karabakh war of 1920. Around this time control of the region was going between the British, the Ottomans, the Armenians, Azerbaijan and Transcaucasia (1918-1920).

If you speak a language, you try to go to the associated country. For instance, many migrants from western subsaharian countries settle in France. Well, there are more migrants that speak English though. English is the predominent language in the world, so the draw of English speaking territories is higher.

Family is extremely important, all the more if you don't speak the language. Usually, you don't speak the language. Even if you do, you come alone with qualifications that won't be given equivalence in Europe, and your application for asylum will most likely be rejected. It is of utmost necessity to have a place to go to after you are told to leave.

When trying to go through the long journey toward western Europe, uncertainty is deadly. Migrants, when they leave, will try to replicate what they know had been done before them, and avoid new routes and uncharted travel plans. This is a matter of survival. Hence, networking is a determining factor behind the choice of a country. A country where many people have tried to apply for asylum will draw many other, independently of the acceptance rate of their candidacy.

724,"Most of the replies are pure political propaganda. The answer is that is has nothing to do with the rulling party, the employment market in Spain is cronically ruined. Even at our economy's peak point before 2008, after decades of economic growth, unemployment barely made it below 10%, and youth has always taken the worst part.

I think it would be better to just bring down the whole system and creating it again being such a mess, but every party knows that a deep reform of the labour market would be a political suicide because of how many circunstancial unemployment it would create, so no one is willing to do that.

I've myself suffered the consequences, when I finished my economics degree I couldn't find anything for a year and ended up driving the postal office van with no contract for a misery.

738,"In the early 16th century there existed a country called the ""Kalmar Union"". It was originally formed in the late 14th century when the aristocrats of the now Nordic countries crowned Eric of Pomerania their king. The last king of the Kalmar Union, the Danish Christian II (Kristian the Tyrant in Sweden), following his defeat of the Swedish Sten Sure, wanted to put down resistance once-and-for-all in Sweden and thsu orchestrated the so called ""Stockholm bloodbath"". He invited a bunch of noblemen, feasted them, stuff happened (talks of reparations, priests were involved, bla bla) and in the end over a hundred noblemen were executed there and then.

This is the origin story of the ""father"" of modern Sweden, Gustav Vasa. Legend goes that he managed to escape the bloodbath that killed his family, fled to the north and asked the people of Dalarna (the Valleys) in the north (now middle of Sweden) to rise up and help him expel the Danish. They did and eventually Gustav Vasa mustered a force, defeated the Danish and left them as Sweden's arch-enemy since them. He later turned to Protestantism and used it as an excuse to confiscate the Catholic Church's rich holdings. Gustav Vasa was an archetypal European absolute monarch or Machiavellian Prince.

Anyway, the way this story was told, of how he dramatically made his way to Dalarna, tried to convince them while fleeing Christian's knights, failed, made his way towards Norway before the people changed their minds and asked him to come back, which he then did - all on skis (and now we have [Vasaloppet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasaloppet)) - it was all very much shaped by how Gustav Vasa wanted it to be (Peder Svart's chornicles).

The story persisted as a form national heritage and was thoght in its heavily biased and exaggerated way up until the mid 20th century, before schools changed their curriculum to put more emphasis on fact-checking and source-critiquing.",,/r/europe/comments/j4ennk/on_this_day_26_years_ago_tanks_ordered_by_boris/g7jxhdk/,ObaafqXzzlrkq,1601757429

746,"It's not made that big of a deal of because its ideologically counter-productive.

The Black October of 93 isn't publicised or taught much, because its the story of how hyper capitalism in Russia resulted in a hyper inflation. Of course not many people enjoyed growing poverty and unemployment, they were unhappy with the government.

This resulted in a coalition of new socialist parties and the old communist party achieving a majority in parliament. They blocked any more capitalist reforms of president Yeltsin. Yeltsin responded by trying to dissolve the parliament. The parliamentarians refused and barricaded themselves in the Russian white House while also impeaching the president. Police arrived trying to get the parliamentarians out of there to enforce the dissolvment. They were met with hundreds of protesters. Eventually the army was called in and had standoffs with protesters across Moscow.

But even in the army there were many disgruntled old time Soviets who then decided they would hand out weapons to the protesters (who already started rioting without their help). Street fights ensured with live ammunition and even tanks firing. Some group of protesters with their new weapons decided they wanted to storm a TV complex to broadcast calls to revolution across Russia. The president by then already sent Spetznas forces to secure that TV complex. The protesters were facing off against them from outside the building. At some point shots were fired including explosives. Parts of the ground floor collapses but miraculously no one of the special units died as far as I recall.

Street fights continued for several days throughout Moscow while the army in support of Yeltsin eventually  sieged down government buildings held by the parliament or pro-parliament protesters. Including the white house itself ending with the surrender of the parliament.

//You can imagine how all that might contradict the ideologies of Western media and governments, as it really shined a bad light on capitalism in Russia at the time. Broadcasting or teaching much about this might haven given too much sympathy for socialism.

There are several inconsistencies in data, that suggest that the most likely scenario is that he was poisoned by Russian agents, because how else you can explain that nothing was found in Omsk toxicology laboratories. but then was found in European ones?

That can be only explained with two scenarios:

1. Russian laboratories lied because they were told to do so or that the samples were swapped (by Russian agents).
2. There is a conspiracy by Navalny's people to do so as a false flag operation. But sincerely they are less than capable of pulling such brilliant and dangerous operation. And they won't get any political dividends from it in Russia.

First scenario is far more likely — Russian agents tried to eliminate Navalny, there were some unforeseen contingencies (mainly paramedics swiftly using the antidote).

872,"&gt;USSR had the fastest growing economy at the time. Economists at the time called it 'bolshevik tempo' and predicted that USSR would eclipse the US. Head chief of CIA called growing economy of USSR the biggest national threat.

Famously there was an American economics textbook written by Paul Samuelson (one of the most famous economists at the time and Nobel laureate) written in 1961 that predicted that the Soviet economy would overtake USA's economy between 1984 and 1997. In later editions of the textbook, the dates started to move forward as the Soviet economy slowed down.

It's interesting how even American economists were confused by Soviet growth. However, now we understand it much better: it grew due to a very high savings rate, but this growth eventually slows down. However, other factors were not as good in USSR as in other countries, Japan overtook USSR despite having a similar savings rate.

Since then we've seen similar things in South Korea, Taiwan, and more recently China. A high savings rate helps a developing economy grow very fast, but eventually it slows down. The Soviet economy seemed magical at the time, but now we know it wasn't all that special.",🇱🇹 living in 🇨🇭,/r/europe/comments/j4b1mq/kalinin_prospekt_moscow_ussr_1977/g7jdcvt/,how_did_you_see_me,1601750476

989,"&gt;I hate the architectural style, but appreciate there is a lot of thought gone into it, including more classic streetscapes like alleys, squares and walkable areas.

This is modern urbanism in a nutshell. The good one at least. ""classic"" streetscapes happened on accident, as cities had little to no planning until very recently, and the disaster that they became has been mostly replaced or improved upon for literally hundreds of years (though especially in the 19th and 20th centuries). Now we know what works and what doesn't, and urban renewal work is one of the most successful results of contemporary architecture. This particular way of planning seems heavily inspired by Camilo Sitte's work, which was very influential in Germany and the UK. Although I find it arbitrary and a bit forced, it's nevertheless interesting. 

Architectural style, in that regard, is largely irrelevant, although I agree that this just looks like Disneyland. Much more can be done being honest with what you're doing and being able to design with modern challenges in mind. It might sound silly to some, and it's just a random example, but it hurts my soul not to see a single solar panel in this image.",Fake Country once again,/r/europe/comments/j4f8lk/the_newly_built_town_of_poundbury_devon_funded_by/g7j0kr1/,AleixASV,1601743728

1021,"1. Bro, Germany wasnt very industrialized itself. Germany's economy wasnt nearly what people in popular media call it. Germany was utterly destroyed, capital pretty much didnt exist anymore after the war. Germany only really became what we think of it is in the late 50s when a certain minister of the economy created the freest market in europe within Germany. Germany's strong protections of private property is why its so powerful today, even if the German state is legislating away this advantage.
2. The Marshall plan was mainly directed at France, the Netherlands, and Belgium. More went to Italy than to Germany. And Germany was still suffering poverty long after the Marshall plan came to an end.
3. GDP is 1. a worthless metric for what we are talking about 2. information provided by the USSR 3. and received by a very pro-USSR media in the west.
4. Ha! Is that the Marxist perspective? Education was already state controlled, and its not like Europe wasn't always a hotbed for socialists. All of those things were irrespective of what the USSR was doing.
5. Mainstream Economists are stupid. The information in your statement is proof for that. They predicted the USSR would eclipse the US in 1988, a few months later it collapsed.
6. I would say economically, per capita Germany suffered the most, not only being absolutely leveled and their capital destroyed. The USSR still had capital to rely on to focus on producing more capital.
7. Population is one of the most important factors, the other being how free the market is. Actually a countries success can be measured pretty well with those two metrics. Whenever a market is freed the country can be expected to have very much long lasting success as long as that is kept true.

Well, let's let's ask the [CIA what they think of the Soviet consumer sector?](https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/DOC_0000497165.pdf) 

&gt;The USSR mounted a substanial program for producing washing machines in the 1960s and refrigerators in the 1970s. By the mid-1970 two-thirds of all Soviet familes had both, and three-fourths had a television set. In the United States almost every family has a refrigerator and TV set, and about three-fourts have washing machines. 

Even in the CIA report, where the horrors of queues, alcoholism and corruption of the Soviet system are painted in all colors, even in this report they admit that 2/3 of Soviet families had a refrigerator and washing machine in the 70s. 

**1970s**. More than 75% of Soviet families have TVs.

Catalonia should be independent, UNLESS there is possible deaths and displacements that come as an expense of their independence. 

Azerbaijanis have nothing to do with Armenian Genocide, treating Azerbaijanis as if they were the ones who genocided Armenians because they are Turks, is racism 101. 1.5 million Armenians didn’t die so that you can scam your into an irrelevant country’s lands, using the genocide. Using Armenian Genocide against Azerbaijan just screams how out-of-the-loop you are. 

Your whole argument of ‘X, which is in Z, is historically Y, so Y should take X no matter what at the cost of thousands of lives’ is wrong and I’m tired of explaining it in every. single. comment. Are you suggesting that self-determination is a more important human right than having the right to live? 

There is not an exact proof that Azerbaijanis started this September conflict, even if Azerbaijanis did, it’s called a counter-attack since Armenia is the one who attacked Azerbaijan since the war has always been inside Azerbaijani soil. 

You seem to love Wikipedia. Just check list massacres of Azerbaijanis and Armenians in the war. 

You literally can’t give any arguments against Armenia controlling non-Nagorno-Karabakh Azerbaijani lands and driving out the Azerbaijanis, other than ‘Azerbaijanis plate free to go’ that is disgusting. That basically says ‘We are forcefully taking your homes and you are obliged to leave, oh and the alternative is that we kill you’ . You can’t even criticize Armenia for occupying majority Azerbaijani lands also when your whole argument is based on self-determination rights. You can see how both Armenia and Azerbaijan fucked up considering human rights. Unlike you, I keep and keep telling that Azerbaijan is also at fault but Armenia still occupying parts of Azerbaijan is not justified.

1) Germany had years headstart in industrialisation. USSR just 50 years prior to 60s was a feudal state with average lifespan of 35 and literacy rate of 10% while Germany was super power with one of the best standards of living in the world. Standarts of living in the USSR massively improved compared to Russian Empire. 

2) Both USSR and Germany were torned by the war, but the Germany enjoyed Marshall plan and protection by the United States, while USSR was the main target of the Cold War and had insane military spending. 

3) USSR had higher GDP per capita as well. Prior to dissolve, it had 2-3x more GDP per capita than any CIS country.

4) Popularity of social democracy and creation of ILO were the reaction to the revolution in Russia, in order to show population that they can enjoy 8-hour work shift, free Healthcare and education etc under capitalism too.

5) USSR had the fastest growing economy at the time. Economists at the time called it 'bolshevik tempo' and predicted that USSR would eclipse the US. Head chief of CIA called growing economy of USSR the biggest national threat.

6) That all was despite being the country who suffered the WWII the most. Prior to WWII, there was the WWI, the Civil War, instability period, sanctions etc, while after the war the Cold War started. USSR was in the war for an entirety of its existence.

7) if the population was the deciding factor, modern CIS countries combined would be still the second economy in the world. This is not the case, we have lower GDP than one Germany.

1230,"&gt;Lol. You are all about Armenia and NK’s sovereignty but when it comes to Azerbaijan’s they should just give up on their lands. Is it justified if Catalonians declare war against Spaniards and expel the local Spanish people living there? Azerbaijan not wanting to let NK go doesn’t justify Armenia occupying other Azerbaijani lands where they ethnically cleansed the area. . 

YES Spain should let Catalonia be independent. Not start a war and kill each other, but let them be independent. Don't you agree?? 

Instead we get Azerbaijan attacking Artsakh who were meant to be in a cease-fire.

Azerbaijan is the aggressor.

Source 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Nagorno-Karabakh_conflict


&gt;Read the human rights watch report again, about a million Azerbaijanis were displaced compared to a quarter of the same amount Armenians

What page?

Do we include millions of Armenians that we *murdered* by turks and the rest that were displaced in the 20th century?

&gt;‘Perhaps they want that land because they are power-hungry with no regards to Armenian life?’
&gt;
&gt;Is this said as a defense for Armenia, which has ethnically cleansed NK and other Azerbaijani areas, killed people in villages who didn’t want to leave their homes? The country that committed Khojaly massacre? 

And unlike you I denounce that. Khojaly was wrong.

Doesn't change the face that Azerbaijan has just attacked Artsakh. Violence that begun becuase Azerbaijan didn't want to recognise Artsakh's rightful independence

&gt;‘If Azerbaijan never wanted to start a war why didn’t they recognize NK?’ 
&gt;
&gt;No country would recognize rebels that want another country inside of it. Armenia is the one who doesn’t want peace, and we know that from how Armenia deported all the Azerbaijani populations in the areas it occupied. You think Azerbaijan will just forget all the massacres, committed by Armenian military and recognize NK? When Armenian military has kicked local Azerbaijanis out of their homes? 

Source on all these massacres and deportations? Stop saying stuff without source. It's not an argument unless you can source you information. 

&gt;‘Azerbaijan should stop repeating the murdering and land grabbing ways of the Turks’
&gt;
&gt;Fucking racist. Who is the land grabber here? What have you been talking about the whole about how NK should be Armenian(without providing arguments against occupied previously-Azerbaijani majority Azerbaijani areas) Armenia is the one that want to grab the lands. Azerbaijanis never set foot on any recognized Armenian land, the war has always been inside Azerbaijan. Armenians are the ones going out of their way to attack and ethnically cleanse Azerbaijani regions at the expense of deportations of a million people and killings of some, includings children who’ve died

Cite to me these numbers? Again no source it's not an argument. 

Not racist. Historically Turks have genocide and land grabbed their way to narionhood. That's why they did it, so they could make a nation in the collapse of the ottoman empire.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Turkey

Think how Azerbaijan citizens were able to move and live in previously independent Artsakh lands... Hmmm.. perhaps when Stalin took the land and gave it to Azerbaijan.. then people migrated there?

1274,"""These people have suffered a genocide in your hands and you are now funding a war against them. Quit supporting your country. It is not moral anymore.""

And Turkish people suffered a genocide by many of hands, including Armenian gangs there. That was not the only Genocide that happened during that time. Ottoman Empire bore heaviest civilian casualties during World War I, nearly 16% of their entire population and more than 2.5 million of them were Turks. More Turks have died in the hands of Armenian gangs(with Russias support) than whole Armenian population there, who were promised by Russia to establish their Great Armenia if they have the majority in the region. My own grandfather lost his 6 sisters (which were older than him before he got borned) in Caucauses during the war, since their village is overrun by Russians (which Armenians are allied to). 


It didn't end there, and %16 doesn't include the ones that killed after WW1. Greek army burned down entire villages while retreating. This was documented in a BBC made documentary but they just said ""every retreating army did that (so no big deal)"" in the documentary. Why you are supporting your side is moral?Even in 1922 there are photo evidence of burned villages and people that were put in mosques and burned there BTW. 

There has been several genocides during WW1 (not sure if they are supposed to be called genocide since the term invented 30 years after WW1) and what you mention here is only one of them. You appearently ignore the rest, especially the ones where the victims are 2-2.5 millions of Turks.

1336,"Italy's far-right chief Matteo Salvini appears in court Saturday for allegedly illegally detaining migrants at sea, in a potentially career-derailing trial he has transformed into a political convention.

Prosecutors in the Sicilian city of Catania accuse Salvini of abusing his powers as then-interior minister to block 116 migrants from disembarking from the Italian Gregoretti coastguard boat last year, under his so-called ""closed ports"" policy.

If the opposition leader and head of the anti-immigrant League party is convicted for more than two years, he could well also be barred from holding public office for six years, preventing him from running for prime minister at the next election in 2023.

""I've picked out my best suit"" for the hearing, Salvini quipped as he arrived in Catania Thursday for three days of rallies, dinners and debates on issues from immigration to security in the city's port area.

The League has printed T-Shirts and advertised cheap flights for the ""Italians choose freedom"" festival, which will feature fellow far-right head Giorgia Meloni, of the Brothers of Italy party, and bigwigs from ex-premier Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia.

A 500-strong police force will be tasked with preventing clashes between Salvini fans and left-wing protesters.

Due to address a rally Saturday after the hearing, Salvini has said he'll ""plead guilty of having defended Italy and Italians"".

In court will be a Nigerian family who claim they were ""treated worse than animals"" and are a civil party in the case.

'Italians will decide'
The 116 migrants, who hailed largely from Sudan, as well as central and western Africa, were rescued in the Mediterranean in two separate operations on July 25 last year after five days at sea. There were 15 unaccompanied minors among them.

They were transferred to the Gregoretti on July 26, then held on the overcrowded patrol vessel under a fierce summer sun despite a scabies outbreak and a suspected case of tuberculosis.

The 15 minors were eventually allowed off on July 29 following pressure from Catania's juvenile court.

The remaining migrants disembarked on July 31 after Salvini, 47, said a deal had been brokered with EU countries to take them.

His defence team insists the decision to hold them was not Salvini's alone, but reached collectively within the government.

'We are ready': Salvini calls for election in anti-government protest with right-wing allies
It will be up to preliminary hearing judge Nunzio Sarpietro to decide if the case is strong enough for the trial to proceed.

He may not arrive at a decision Saturday, but request further preliminary hearings, Italian media said.

Salvini, who has said Sicilian judges would be better off concentrating on jailing mafiosi than trying him, declared that it would be ""the Italians, in the next elections, who will say whether I did the right thing or not"".

Analysts say the legal trouble is unlikely to hurt Salvini's popularity, but could on the contrary work in his favour.

Salvini's fierce ""Italians First"" stance saw his popularity shoot up as interior minister, though his polling numbers slid significantly during the coronavirus lockdown, which overshadowed the migrant question.

With the centre-left government promising to water down Salvini's harsh security decree which makes it easier to expel migrants, the stage is set for a fresh political showdown.

1366,"Idk if you really are from the USA, but if yes, you really need to study the German political system more. 
In the East, since it's the successor to the SED party, the party ""Die Linke"" has always been a serious contender in every election in the states of East Germany. 

However this doesn't mean that it's a left extremist party. In fact, it's more of a ""Volkspartei"" in the East, a party which acts on democratic principles and reflects the desires of a significant portion of the population. 

In fact, if you want to see extremists in ""Die Linke"", you have way better chances looking for them in ""Die Linke"" branches in West Germany. The thing is that in the West, the SPD has traditionally been the party for workers' rights and social justice. However, the SPD hasn't managed to fully take over that role in the states of East Germany, leaving ""Die Linke"" in powerful positions in many of those states. There have been many coalitions of SPD and Die Linke in East Germany. 

Probably the best example for ""Die Linke"" being relatively moderate in the East compared to the West is Bodo Ramelow, the current prime minister of Thuringia. He's managed to get tremendous success in the last two elections while being pretty conservative from a ""Linke"" point of view. He even has high approval ratings in other parties like the CDU which naturally are the enemies of ""Die Linke"" (due to all the capitalism vs. socialism thing). 

Also I'm wondering, if the ""Die Linke"" extremists mostly are in the East, why have they lost so much ground to the AfD? The AfD is very successful in the East because people there are unhappy and does this through their extremist positions. If ""Die Linke"" was extremist in any way in the East they wouldn't lose to the AfD that much. Many ""Die Linke"" voters have gone to the AfD. 

TLDR, the left extremists mostly are in the West, not in the East.",,/r/europe/comments/j43y4q/on_this_day_30_years_ago_east_germany_reunified/g7hy2id/,1terrortoast,1601714861

An EV using 200W/km at pure coal (800 grams/kWh) gives 160grams of CO2 per km, and that is equal to an ICE releasing 130g CO2 per km if you also include the refining for the ICE car.  
  
I also showed that 60mpg equals less than 4 liter/100 miles, and that 60mpg equals about 90g/km, or 112.5 g/km if you include refining of the oil.

My father once told me this story. He went to east Germany for a trip and wanted to eat a bun with a roast sausage.
He got a tiny sausage at this food truck and nothing else.
When he asked for a bun, people around him started laughing and the guy in the food truck threw a piece of toast at him, saying ""oh man you guys from the west don't know anything. Do you really think I could give you a proper bun?""

Personally, I don't blame the Austrian companies, which are only taking advantage of the corrupt local and high authorities (our Minister of Environment kind of gave himself awat when he claimed that ""there is no illegal deforestation going on in the country""). If it weren't for them, their illegal deforestation wouldn't be happening in the first place. Our officials are illegally lumbering just as much as the Austrians, if not more, so there's that.

The actions of in Syria, the constanct threat of the refugees, attacking Armenian troops in the conflic between Armenia and Azerbajan, the incidents in Greece with Turk troops breaking fences at the border to let refugees enter in Greece, the incident with the greek jets , etc, and in this case trying to wipe out from history some facts.

You might want to keep in mind that part of what was done in the domestication process was to breed out behavior that was problematic for living with people.

There is some crossing of [servals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serval) — a small wildcat — with domestic cats to produce ""[savannah cat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savannah_cat)"" hybrids that have a serval-like appearance but behavior more like that of a domestic cat.

There are also some people who keep regular servals. I recall reading a description from one woman who owned a pair.   She commented that the cats' idea of entertainment includes waiting until someone's back is turned and then running at 35 mph (that'd be 56km/h) and flying head-first into the small of their back.  They also do apparently bite somewhat.  And I'd assume that they're probably one of the less-difficult-to-deal-with species of wild cat.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/j3uatn/new_report_finds_that_the_eu_is_a_hotspot_for/g7hacnk/,duisThias,1601695576

The Chinese would never allow it. NK is an important buffer state between China and a US friendly ally. Which is why they support NK even though Kim is nuts and supporting it financially is a pain in the butt.

Reunification was a significant economic challenge for Germany, but it wasn't some horrible humanitarian crisis. North Korea is by all accounts completely dysfunctional economically and any attempt to bring it up to a standard of living comparable to South Korea would be extremely difficult.

A reunified Korea will cost billions upon billions of dollars and South Korea will foot most of that bill. For comparison, the reunification of Germany has been estimated to cost somewhere in the neighborhood of two trillion euros. East Germany had much better infrastructure and was logistically much easier to bring into unity with West Germany than North Korea will be for South Korea. Reunification could completely decimate the South’s economy.

1775,"&gt;Yes, millions of Italians were victims. 

I'm sure thats sarcasm.

Sure there's allways nuance. But I can with quite a certainty say, The Nazis were perpetrators of the Holochaust and Generalplan OST, therefore I can have much more understanding for why the people exiled German diaspora post-WW2 and killed some in revenge.. and with the same certainty I can say the Italians wanted and tried to wipe out Slovenes and Croats, so... the perpetrators, and the same applies here, I can find much more understanding with those who were victims of Italian agression seeking revenge.

The German Nazis and Italian Fascists did not kill for revenge, they killed out of greed, and racial hatred.

So who to sympathize with. Those killed because of the killers greed and racial hatred, or those killed out of revenge for what they did to the perpetrators.

You really don't get it do you... You really don't understand that Fascist Italians were the same to Slovenes as Nazi Germans, both came to exterminate the people and take the land. And you think the people whos families were being executed are then supposed to turn the other cheek? Treat their killers respectfully? Show mercy? For what?..

By the sounds of it then you would envisage a untied Ireland as being a dual-country thing? A parliament in Dublin and a parliament in Belfast running parallel?

I do think, in the hypothetical situation of unification, that it should be a stated goal for both parliaments to move ever closer in policy until almost totally in line, and to one day merge into one single all-Ireland parliament. That should be based in a new city, not Belfast or Dublin. Athlone is the one which is floated most often as its the geographic center of the island.

From where I stand most genocidal people are Europeans, in a disgusting scale and worst part is there is noone to speak out loud because they control the public opinion not Algeria, whatever Algeria that is a neo-colony of France.

By the way I just want to tell you this. When people in Bengal standed against British colonialism, Winston Churchill conducted a faminity genocide on them to ''put them on line'' again. Two summers ago when I went to England his face were on 5 pounds. I wonder what educated Indians feel about it considering many of them have British citizenship.

French still doesnt acknowledge its Rwandan genocide. For some reason this doesnt strike much to huge Armenian diaspora in there. One would expect they would develope at least some sympathy to their cause.

Belgium was once the most genocidal country in Europe, what did it do for those attrocities? Acknowledgement, compensation?

Europe's wealth comes from genocides, attrocities and trans-atlantic slavery. Most of these arent acknowledged, compensated.

Klaipeda port is the first one that may lose cargo, but so far, the mood in the port is not bad at all. According to preliminary data, cargo overall increased by 9.3 percent in the last month. According to preliminary data, the port in September handled 3.95 mln. tons of cargo, whereas in September of last year, the port handled 3.6 mln. tons of cargo.

Such jump was also caused by grain handling, but the decrease in Belarusian cargo was not felt either. ""The statistics we have so far do not record a fall. And in September, grain and bulk fertilizers were very ""fertile"" in the port, ""said Dovilė Ringis, Assistant Director General for Public Relations of the Port.

According to Martynas Burba, the representative of the company ""Lithuanian railway"", the preliminary data show that in September there was no less cargo, and probably more cargo than in August. In August, the flow of Belarusian cargo to Klaipeda alone reached 1.3 million. tons.

It's the second one that influences behaviour.

This is central to the entire conflict, what to do when people who *do* have the passport *do not* behave according to a (rather difficult to define) set of expectations?  

For me those expectations consist of a few hard line core values of gender equality, bodily integrity, freedom of choice in religion and marriage, and rule of law.

They did a coup. There was no killing of any Turks whatsoever until the Turks invaded on the 20th of July. The Turkish Cypriots had a few 100s of casualties in 1974, but they were **all** killed after the 20th of July, during the war that Turkey initiated with the aim to partition Cyprus, an aim they had since the 1950s.

The coupists did kill Greek Cypriot fighters, defenders of the Greek Cypriot president the coupists were trying to kill, and those fighters are well known and commemorated, and are not mixed with the casualties that resulted from the Turkish invasion.

1. Someone claimed kurdish was banned in Turkey I rebutted by saying no there is a kurdish channel literally bankrolled by government so obviously its not banned.

2. Nobody here denied political repression against opposition media by AKP goverment and this wasn't even relevant. Nevertheless you jumped in to the argument making yourself look like a fool by arguing about something that nobody claimed.

You are missing the point entirely. 

Yes, subsidies on EVs are being cut, however, it's also getting more expensive to drive fossil. 

The goal is to ban sales of fossil cars by 2025. And honestly, it won't probably make sense to own fossil by then anyhow.

Imagine having to go to a gas station to fill up on fuel, when you can just do that from home.

Imagine having to do maintenance on an engine that is slowly degrading itself.

I'm skeptical that Russia would allow armed aircraft from a NATO country to fly through their airspace on their way to bomb a neighboring country.

&gt; One of the biggest strength of the rafale is its ability to carry a lot of fuel

While that's certainly nice capability, fuel wouldn't be the only concern for such a mission.  I'm not a military general or anything, but thinking about how such a mission would go, aside from the airspace issue, I'd be curious where France would bomb and what the plans are if one of their planes gets shot down. 

To attack Azeri troops along the border where the fighting is happening from the Caspian Sea would required essentially flying over the entirety of Azerbaijan's airspace.

In Cyprus and Syria, though, where the neo-ottoman imperialist would rather be advanced otherwise, you say that the UN endorsed peace process must override considerations of sovereignty by the UN recognized government.

2. The resolutions only mention 7 surrounding districts, there is no mention about Nagorno-Karabakh

2483,"Those texts are not from the UN Security Council resolutions. 

There is no such text in the resolutions: ""... withdrawal of Armenia ...""

There is no such text in the resolutions: ""Armenian troops""

That same wiki link sources in the External links section the real UN Security Council resolutions (https://2001-2009.state.gov/p/eur/rls/or/13508.htm)

These resolutions:

- do NOT recognise Nagorno Karabakh as invaded or occupied;

- do NOT recognise Armenia having invaded any territories; 

- do NOT demand withdrawals of any forces by Armenia from anywhere

- do NOT demand withdrawal of any forces from Nagorno Karabakh.

You cannot find anything related to the above in the resolutions.

These resolutions recognise the invasions of the **surrounding territories** carried out by the de facto Nagorno Karabakh without naming the latter given that it is unrecognised and using the formulations ""local forces"" in Nagorno Karabakh and ""Armenians of Nagorno Karabakh"". See below.

The only references to the nature of the forces are in:

- res 822 preamble: the Republic of Azerbaijan by **local Armenian forces**.

- res 853 clause 9: Urges the Government of the Republic of Armenia to continue to exert its influence to achieve compliance by **the Armenians of the Nagorny-Karabakh **region of the Azerbaijani Republic with its resolution 822 (1993) and the present resolution, and the acceptance by this party of the proposals of the Minsk Group of the CSCE;

- res 884 clause 2: Calls upon the Government of Armenia to use its influence to achieve compliance by the **Armenians of the Nagorny Karabakh** region of the Azerbaijani Republic with resolutions 822 (1993) , 853 (1993) and 874 (1993) , and to ensure that the forces involved are not provided with the means to extend their military campaign further;


Furthermore in the above two clauses are the only places where something is demanded from Armenia, and they make a distinction between Armenia and Armenians of Nagorno Karabakh.

Furthermore, these same resolutions incessantly refer to the peaceful resolution of the conflict within the framework of the OSCE Minsk Group (Search for ""Minsk"" or ""CSCE"" (old name for OSCE)).

The OSCE Minsk Group gets a UN mandate to contain and settle this conflict based on the Helsinki Final Act framework.

This settlement plan is the following:

&gt; The Basic Principles reflect a reasonable compromise based on the Helsinki Final Act principles of Non-Use of Force, Territorial Integrity, and the Equal Rights and **Self-Determination** of Peoples.

&gt; The Basic Principles call for inter alia:

&gt;- return of the territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh to Azerbaijani control;

&gt;- **an interim status for Nagorno-Karabakh providing guarantees for security and self-governance;**

&gt;- **a corridor linking Armenia to Nagorno-Karabakh;**

&gt;- **future determination of the final legal status of Nagorno-Karabakh through a legally binding expression of will;**

&gt;- the right of all internally displaced persons and refugees to return to their former places of residence; and

&gt;- international security guarantees that would include a peacekeeping operation.

Azerbaijan has agreed to the above and yet refuses to finalise it because it rejects the application of the self-determination principle and instead decided to go against the terms of the UN Security Council resolution and resolve it by use of force in violation of the principles it agreed to and in violation of the Helsinki Final Act agreement in place since 1975 and further agreed to by Azerbaijan in the 90s.

No reputable international media refers to Nagorno Karabakh as occupied territory nor refers to Armenia as an invader. Because the legal status of Nagorno Karabakh is that of a break-away region and not an invasion.

The ceasefire agreement in 1994 had three signatories, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Nagorno Karabakh.",,/r/europe/comments/j3qvqv/armenia_says_ready_to_engage_with_osce_to/g7e0ik0/,Idontknowmuch,1601635430

If we are going that route then lets mention the 300,000 Armenians who were forced to flee Azerbaijan after pogroms (Baku pogrom, Ganja pogrom, Maraga Massacre) and massacres killed hundreds, and the Armenians of the Shahumanyan region that were deported by Azerbaijani Soviet authorities when the war broke out. That whole region was cleansed, not a single Armenian lives there today. Lets mention the Siege of Stepanakert while we are at it, when Azerbaijan surrounded the capital of NK and tried to starve out the population, killed hundreds of civilians of the 40 thousand who lived there with artillery. 

Don't preach me your whataboutist bullshit and call it ""just being honest"" when you are quite literally omitting half the story in regards to human rights violations. 

I didn't mention those things because both countries are guilty of it, it was a wartime population exchange.

2604,"&gt; How’s the COVID situation in your country?

Chaotic, albeit thankfully with low fatalities so far (only 2543 officially, 67/1M). This is shared by whole Eastern Europe, with no clear explanation (major theory is compulsory tuberculosis vaccination, started under communism, and covering all people since few decades - but it's not proven). We (Poland) are breaking new cases records in last week, there is a sharp rise (despite low testing, 2nd worst in EU), mostly attributed to restart of schools and holidays month ago (two most affected provinces are coastal and mountainous). It looks worrying. Mostly due to low testing, and lack of any sensible contact tracing.

&gt; Were there lasting changes or are things somehow getting back to normal already?

Lasting - compulsory masking (at the start in April everywhere, after few weeks limited to inside public spaces - transport, shops, offices etc. - but now it might return outside in most affected counties) is probably the major change in daily life, along with expected distancing. Sadly, it's also the most attacked one, we have our share of covidiots. Those who don't mask are also those who complained about lockdown, but they don't understand we exactly need to mask (and overall, behave responsibly) to avoid another one.

Another change is remote learning - covering all types of schools since March until June, and now still carried by majority of colleges (new year started yesterday). Lower schools returned to ""normal"" mode, but it might collapse.",Жыве Беларусь!,/r/europe/comments/j3pb8s/kumusta_cultural_exchange_with_rphilippines/g7dk4by/,pothkan,1601620351

2613,"In which war have you heard France sent the Legion alone to fight, you shitweasel? lmao. The amount of stupid shit people say about the Legion is baffling... No, the Legion is not a mercenary force as much as cool/epic or ammoral/disgusting people are trying to make it out to be. It is not some kind of special super-army France has that does uncommon stuff either and all that bullshit about them being sent to the most dangerous theaters instead of ""real Frenchmen""... You people are absolutely deranged lol. Even ignoring the Commandos Marine and other special operations forces of the French military, what are those dangerous theaters you're all talking about the Legion having been sent to that French paratroopers, marines or alpine hunters (mountain troops) haven't also seen? The Foreign Legion is a light infantry force, an elite one sure and probably the one with the most ""brutal"" training, but it is not the only elite infantry force of the French army and not necessarily the best either even if it seems to be regarded as the best France has to offer by non-French people even above French special forces hahahahaha. Well I guess, it is the only branch of the French army which accept foreigners... and with the Frenchmen being ""cowardly pussies"", if France turn out to have successful military operations or turns out to have one of best trained and professional armies in the world, it must have something to do with said foreigners. That's the logic I guess.

The legion is an integral part of the regular French army and its regiments are deployed alongside regiments of other branches of the army as part of tactical groups or brigades. It is not deployed anywhere alone and has almost always never been even in the past despite the circle-jerk. ""France is sending the Legion"" is a moronic statement and only a thing to ignorant dumbasses. The French army (land military) currently has an active personnel of 117,000. The Legion represents only 8,000 to 9,000 of those. Do you think the 108,000 to 109,000 of an all volunteer professional force (no conscription in France) are getting paid for the sake of it? Afghanistan, Mali, Irak, CAR or whatever... French marines, paratroopers, mountain troops fought in them all, not just legionnaires. The worst is you can see combat footage of those guys (who, alongside the Legion, form the bulk of France's expeditionary forces as they are the best trained and experienced of the regular troops) being titled ""the French Foreign Legion in combat in [insert country here]"" all over the internet when those guys are out there in the wild risking their lives as much as their brothers of the Legion and being accused of being pussies protected by the French government while throwing those of foreigners away. Legionnaires may have been seen as disposable in the early decades since the creation of the Legion, but that hasn't been the case forever now.  Ivan, Pawel, Lei Ming or Ramirez are as much ""French soldiers"" today as Jean-François Baguette and Pierre-Antoine des Neuf Croissants are.

They abducted a villager who wandered across from a border village, put military boots on him, and Azerbaijani military load-bearing vest (not even enough effort for an Armenian one) over HIS CIVILIAN CLOTHES. They claimed he was a saboteur, and then proceeded to torture him to death. Clearly not for information, what the fuck would a villager know. They killed him because they got their hands on an Armenian.

Baku said he died of acute lung and heart failure. Dude was maybe in his 30s-40s? Yeah, unlikely he had a heart attack realizing his failure as a ""soldier"". Dude was tortured till his heart gave out.

That same article mentions how they beat the fuck out of a 77 year old Armenian man who wandered across the border. After being detained FOR A MONTH (what risk does a 77 year old man pose? Does your grandfather pose the same?)

In the April Clashes, when Azerbaijan overran a border village in the Republic of Artsakh, they killed an elderly couple that couldn't flee with the rest. Mutilated their bodies, cut off their ears for trophies.

2684," October 1, 2020 3:44AM EDT 

(Istanbul) – A Kurdish man has died after security forces arrested him  and another man and took them away from their village in southeastern [Turkey](http://www.hrw.org/europecentral-asia/turkey) in a helicopter on September 11, 2020, Human Rights Watch said today.

The two men were hospitalized two hours after being arrested. A medical  report attributed the fatal injuries of Servet Turgut, 55, to an  “unspecified fall” and the injuries of the other man, Osman Siban, 50,  to a “fall from a high location/fall from a helicopter.” Turgut died in a  hospital on September 30. Şiban was discharged from the hospital on  September 20.

“The Turkish authorities have an obligation to promptly, effectively,  and transparently investigate how Servet Turgut and Osman Şiban were so  seriously injured in the custody of security forces, and ultimately how  Turgut died,” said [Hugh Williamson](https://www.hrw.org/about/people/hugh-williamson),  Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “The  authorities’ highly unconvincing explanation that Turgut fell from a  rocky place before his arrest flies in the face of statements by  witnesses, who saw both men being arrested and taken away healthy in a  helicopter.”

According to standard procedure, an initial hospital report stating  cause of injury normally relies on the information conveyed by the  patient themselves or, if they are unable to communicate, information  supplied by persons bringing them to hospital. Doctors told Human Rights  Watch that the two men were barely conscious on admission to hospital.  The men were brought with military personnel in attendance, as confirmed  in a statement by the governor’s office in Van, the town in eastern  Turkey where the men were hospitalized. A full autopsy report to  establish the cause of Turgut’s death is expected.

The [statement](http://www.van.gov.tr/van-valiligi-basin-duyurusu)  by the Van governor’s office on September 21 claimed that Turgut fell  from a rocky place and resisted arrest but it didn’t mention Şiban’s  injuries, and accused the two of aiding the armed Kurdistan Workers’  Party (PKK). The prosecutor has placed a secrecy order on the  investigation file preventing the families’ lawyers from obtaining  information.

Turgut’s family told Human Rights Watch that on September 11, Turgut was  working on his farm in the Surik hamlet of Çığlıca village, in  Beytüşşebap district, when a nearby clash between Turkish soldiers and  the PKK resulted in the death of three soldiers and a PKK member.

The family alleges that officers caught Turgut and took him to a central  place in the village, where all the men of the village were made to  kneel down while the soldiers checked their IDs. Military officers asked  villagers to identify Turgut since he did not have his ID with him.  They also asked who Osman Şiban was.

Witnesses said military officers shouted at the villagers: “We are in  pain. Who will we take it out on, if not you? We are going to burn your  village down.” The villagers assumed the soldiers were referring to the  soldiers’ deaths. The security forces then took Şiban and Turgut away in  a helicopter.

The families of both men called nearby military bases over the next two  days but were told that neither was in their custody. On September 13,  Turgut’s brother told the officer on the phone he would inform the media  if they refused to tell him where his brother was. He received a call  15 minutes later informing him that his brother and Şiban were in an  intensive care unit of a state hospital in Van, 338 kilometers by road  from their village.

When family members and their lawyers arrived at the hospital that day,  they found police officers guarding the men’s rooms, preventing access.  The lawyers told Human Rights Watch that the Van prosecutor is  investigating the two men for allegedly “aiding and abetting” the PKK.  Following a complaint by the lawyers, they said, the prosecutor has  opened an investigation into allegations that the two men were tortured  in custody.

The Van prosecutor also verbally informed the lawyers that there was a  detention warrant justifying the police presence in hospital. The  lawyers have not received any official document recording that the men  were taken into custody.

A lawyer for Turgut and Şiban shared with Human Rights Watch relevant  legal and medical documents. Medical reports show that military officers  took the two men first to a private Van hospital – *Lokman Hekim* – at  around 7:13 p.m. on the day of their arrest. They had bruises on their  faces, necks, and torsos as well as humeral fractures and hemorrhages.  The private hospital immediately transferred them to the state Van  Research and Training hospital due to the severity of their conditions.  The state hospital placed both men in an intensive care unit.

Strong discrepancies between the Van governor’s statement and witness  statements raise concerns that the authorities are already engaged in  covering up what happened to the men and may prevent an effective,  transparent investigation into the incident. The governorship claims  both men were apprehended in the same location, though witnesses say  that about 15 military officers brought Turgut to the village while [Şiban was having tea](https://www.gazeteyolculuk.net/valilik-kacarken-dustuler-dedi-helikopterden-atilan-koylulerin-yakinlari-aciklamayi-yalanladi) there with his brother.

Two days after Siban was discharged from the hospital, three armored  vehicles arrived at his house to take him to a former military hospital  under orders from the prosecutor who wanted to affirm whether he was  well enough to testify. Doctors said that Şiban was disoriented, unable  to discern the date or to talk about the incident. Şiban left Van for  his family residence in Mersin after the medical assessment and remains  there. The prosecutor’s investigation against him is ongoing.

In recent years, there have been other instances of security forces  arresting and ill-treating civilians after military casualties sustained  in clashes between the military and the PKK in the country’s southeast.  For example, in May 2019, the Şanlıurfa Bar Association documented the  torture and ill-treatment of 55 men and women in Halfeti, Şanlıurfa, who  had been arrested in the wake of an armed clash in which a police  officer died. The Interior Ministry [dismissed those torture allegations](https://www2.tbmm.gov.tr/d27/7/7-13518sgc.pdf) as “baseless.”

Under international law, Turkey has an obligation to investigate all  deaths in custody and hold those responsible to account. The European  Court of Human Rights has made clear, including in multiple cases  against Turkey, that when an individual is taken into custody in good  health and is injured in custody, any state party to the European  Convention on Human Rights must provide a plausible explanation of how  those injuries were caused, and that the obligation to account for an  individual’s death in custody is particularly stringent.

The United Nations Human Rights Committee has said that protection of  the right to life under the International Covenant on Civil and  Political Rights requires an effective investigation into deaths in  custody, and authorities should make public the findings, conclusions,  and recommendations of the investigation.

“Turkey has an entrenched culture of impunity when it comes to abuses by  the security forces, no matter how serious,” Williamson said. “A  failure to effectively investigate this latest case, as in so many other  cases of serious abuse, would not just deny justice to the two men and  their families, but give a green light to Turkey’s security forces to  keep on abusing.”",,/r/europe/comments/j3pv7k/turkey_man_dies_after_military_custody_human/g7dlvau/,swindlerxxx,1601621629

The 433 has a folding stock which is a serious development because it means that internally it works in a significantly different way from the M16 family which doesn't have folding stocks. Same thing with the quick-change barrel which the M16 family doesn't have; a quick-change barrel means that you don't need to keep track of more than one different length rifles, you just swap the barrel for whatever mission you need. France explicitly required their new rifle to be available in two specific barrel lengths, which any rifle with a quick-change barrel could fulfill. The 433 sadly still has a non-reciprocating charging handle for whatever stupid reasons, but other rifles don't and have both the previous features.

The G36 is a great European design (regardless what the German politicians have been brainwashed to believe) and it's definitely a lot more worthy to be copied that an old American design that has overstayed its welcome.

Everyone had their own design tailored to their necessities thirty years ago, suddenly when the patents for the AR expired that design is perfectly suited to so many armies now.

2801,"I see you never tried it all. And think Germans are some Hardboiled loud Barbarians. Its a shame realy, that you refuse to even try any of the other options as i can give you a list of 20 Sepereate types of Bread Buns, 30 Diffirent types of Bread Loafs and atleast 70% of wich contain no seeds. 

Yet here you are spouting complete and utter nonsense, its insulting and infuriating having to know there are uneducated uncultured barbarians like you existing on a Continent like Europe. 

We have:

Schrippen (Sunday Bread Buns, there is both West and East Shrippen each of wich have diffirent specific flavors depending on wherever or not the West or East version is made in the West, North, East, South or Middle of Germany. The West West Shrippen are overly sweet and contain ample ammounts of sugar while the West Berlin East Schrippen are one of the best East Schrippen you can get)

Bauernecke, is a type of Grey bread with its crust laced with various of Seeds for added flavor. Its my personal Favorite of Seeded Crust No Seed Dough Grey Bread as the crust itself is a bit softer than lets say Potato Grey Bread. 

Pumpernickel is a type of Seed Bread that is primarily a loaf of Seeds pressed then baked, its a very fragile bread with a strong savory taste. It works with many things, especialy Bacon or Fresh Cheese sprinkled with Beef Jerky.

Laugenecke is a type of Lyebread bun in the form of a triangle and layer dough formation. Its a fresh tasting type of bread usualy enjoyed with Butter or Fresh Cheese though various of types of Salami, Ham, etc. work too. 

Buttermilchbrötchen is a type of Milk Bread bun made from Butter Milk instead of normal Milk. It has a slightly sweet taste and is basicaly a more tasty and soft version of the British Crumpet.

And these are just my favorites. If you go around and claim that our Bread is nothing but seeds you should be prepared to get proven otherwise with short and discribt means of someone who loves bread over anything else (I do agree though that all other Germany Quisine is utterly terrible ... though that goes for all Food from East Europe)

And do inform yourself about common German Mannerisims before you go and claim that our ""Default"" is yelling at each other.

And since then our species has literally never enjoyed as much peace as it has. Prior to the 20th century there was non-stop war *everywhere*.

Russia is literally a nation riddled with nothing but war throughout its entire history.

I claim what I was taught at college and what Czech sources claim - there was ultimatum on 21st of January. But I guess they are all just lying, right? It's impossible for you to be wrong, right?

&gt; Then on 23 January Šnejdárek came to Polish commander Latinik dressed like French officer (lmao) and demanded Polish forces to retreat

For fuck's sake...

Demanding retreat with threat of attack if demand isn't met is ultimatum. WTF would you want?

&gt; But I guess that's how Czechs go to war, dressed as soldiers of another army

That's how they went to war two months after WW1, in which they fought in miltaries of different nations like France...

&gt; I am talking about the part Poland claimed, which was in majority inhabited by Poles.

OK. Still irrelevant.

&gt; But it was decided that the territory will be divided, yet Prague wanted all of it for themselves.

What Prague wanted is irrelevant. I want peace in Middle East, that doesn't mean I get it. What matters is what actually happened, which is Poland acting like that territory belonged to it, ignored protests, refused to retreat, Czechoslovakia attacked but stopped when told to by Entente powers, withdrew and territory was divided between Czechoslovakia and Poland at Spa conference.

&gt; And?

And that violates agreement which states that who gets what is to be decided.

&gt;  Agreement didn't prohibit anything like

Is your mind fucking circle? We already went through that. It isn't necessary to prohibit in detail every possibility.

&gt; it didn't mean that it is fully Polish territory

It wasn't fully anyone's territory. It was disputed territory. Yet Poland acted like it was Polish territory. That's fucking point. As I said, consult it with lawyer.

As for recommendations; If you want to sacrifice a day, Nuuksio national park is accessible by train &amp; bus from Helsinki. It takes bit over an hour one way, but once there... the nature is just lovely.

You don't realize, Turkey is home to the world's largest refugee population, with over 3.6 million Syrian refugees and close to 400,000 refugees and asylum seekers of other nationalities.

That's almost as much as the [entire EU took on during the 2010-2013 period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_migrant_crisis#Background). We *could* easily handle it if we had efficient integration, but we don't because we expect the best in people and for them to willfully adabt to any- and every system and culture we have. 

Secondly, Turkey knows it's a giant blocker and nexus of things. Everything from Istanbul blocking ports, to being a major power versus Russia. **If the EU would eject Turkey then Erdögan would be so happy because he'd be able to join Lukachenkov and Putin as despots** ruining their own countries. Ofcourse he wouldn't be top dog, but he isn't that right now either which is why he keeps waving threats around to sound like a big boy. I mean the west basically went entirely silent when he did a false-flag coup and murdered- or deposed over 8000 turks etc.

Message from Armenia to the national minorites of Azerbaijan

&gt;Considering  the fact that the national minorities of Azerbaijan - Lezgins, Talysh,  Avars, Tats - became victims of the aggression unleashed by Azerbaijan -  the authorities of the Artsakh Republic appeal to these peoples. They  can take advantage of a number of assistance measures in case they  surrender to the Artsakh army: for this they must be unarmed, hold their  hands above their heads and have a white flag or a piece of white  clothing in their hands. After surrender - immediately clarify that they  are from national minorities. ""In this case, this person will be  considered not as a prisoner of war, but as a guest of the Armenian  people"" - the statement of the chairman of the Artsakh Republic  parliament.

3078,"&gt;The concept of a nation-state didn't exist because it is an invention

No shit, any other hot take? Yes of course they are inventions, so what? The idea that society needs to be organized in states is an invention, the idea that a state had to be run by a guy with a pointy hat was an invention (one that for some crazy reason you seem to like), the idea that there are laws, and we need to respect them is an ""invention"". National identities and any other form of identity are ""inventions"", everything that is a social construct is an “invention”. Most things you deal with daily are ""inventions"" but this does not stop them from fundamentally influencing your life.

&gt;and by the way Italy is not a nation, is a state.

It depends on what you mean with ""nation"", and I don’t think you know what you mean yourself. The concept of “nation” is a complicated and nuanced idea and on top of that, the way we use the word nation has changed over time. The term “Italian nation” is often used in medieval texts. Here are some examples:

“Nelle lettere che scrive ordinariamente si chiama re e grande imperatore, con infiniti altri titoli; e con tale occasione diro che ho inteso che egli è molto inclinato alla nazione italiana e in particolare ai veneziani ; e si è fatto fabbricare un palazzo simile al nostro, con una sala come quella del gran consiglio” “In the letters, he ordinarily writes he is called king and great emperor, with infinite other titles; and on this occasion, I will say that I have understood that he is very inclined to the Italian nation and in particular to the Venetians; and he had a building similar to ours built, with a hall like that of the great council "" (Girolamo Lippomano, 1575, relazione presentata al suo ritorno dalla Polonia, pagina 308 “Le relazioni degli ambasciatori Veneti al Senato” raccolta curata da Eugenio Alberi)

“Onde la pace con questa Maestà è per durar tanto quanto vorrà questo illustrissimo Dominio, ancorchè i ministri cesarei non manchino con ogni occasione di far tristissimi officj, essendo per loro natura inimicissimi della nazione italiana, e odiando in particolare questa eccellentissima Repubblica.” “Therefore peace with this Majesty is to last as long as this most illustrious Dominion wills, even though the Caesarean ministers do not fail with every occasion to perform sadly office, being by their nature very inimical to the Italian nation, and particularly hating this most excellent Republic.” (Leonardo Mocenigo, 1559, “Le relazioni degli ambasciatori Veneti al Senato” raccolta curata da Eugenio Alberi, volume 14, pag 117).

From these sentences, we can determine that nation could indicate a cultural area with a shared identity, a little bit as it does today. However, that is not the only way the word nation was used, it could be used to indicate the city of origin, or more broadly the place someone was born, or even the family or dynasty one belonged to. The term nation is even used to indicate the “oltramontani” a non-coherent group of people that only shared the fact of being “foreign” because not Italian. Medieval commentators such as Marin Sanudo and Mario Equicola D'Alueto use the term “natione oltramontana” in their respective texts to indicate non-Italians.

So, we can safely say that nation as not always meant exactly what we mean by it now and that it used to be a much more flexible term with a broader meaning. The use of “nation” as one exclusive cultural identity is a meaning of the word that we started to develop in 1700/1800 and it is from that period onward that one can see the word nation start being used exclusively for the concept of Italy, Spain, or France. ""Nation"" is just a word, whose definition depends on how it is used. According to how ""nation"" is used today, yes Italy is a nation (or better a nation with a state, a nation-state, as now most states derive their legitimacy from representing a nation), if you disagree you need to tell me how you think nation-hood is defined today.

However, whatever standard one uses the idea that Italy was simply a geographic concept, or just a ""peninsula"", as you suggest, seems to me to be incredibly inaccurate.Italians were pretty much perceived as one cohesive group of people from the middle ages forward. Here is how a Venetian senator classified the cardinals voting for the election of the pope, sorting them through nationality.

“Tra questi ne sono oltramontani 18, cioè 7 francesi, 4 spagnuoli. 2 polacchi, 1 unghero. Gli altri 42 sono italiani , ne quali ce ne sono 10 di sudditi del re cattolico, 18 romani dello Stato del Papa, 4 dello Stato della Serenità vostra (Serenissima Repubblica di Venezia) , 3 di Fiorenza, 2 di Ferrara, 1 di Mantova, 2 di Genova, 1 di Lucca, e 1 di Parma” “Among these, there are 18 from beyond the mountains, that is 7 French, 4 Spaniards. 2 Poles, 1 Cork. The other 42 are Italians, of which there are 10 subjects of the Catholic king, 18 Romans of the Papal State, 4 of the State of your Serenity (Serenissima Republic of Venice), 3 of Fiorenza, 2 of Ferrara, 1 of Mantua, 2 of Genoa, 1 of Lucca, and 1 of Parma "" (Lorenzo Priuli, 1587, 197 “Le relazioni degli ambasciatori Veneti al Senato”)

This is not an isolated quote, it’s the way cardinals were always sorted at each pope election. Machiavelli once argued with the Cardinal of Rouen. During a diplomatic mission. The Cardinal of Rouen told him ""Italians don't understand war!"" to which he retorted offended ""Then the French don't understand politics"" (from the third chapter of the Prince). It seems to me to be a bit too dramatic of a reaction for what you are saying was perceived as just a geographic expression.

Furthermore, if you read some Medieval commentators you will notice that in mixed nationalities armies infighting was common and it was often provoked by identarian reasons. In 1574 Placido Ragazzoni tells us that Italian and Spanish soldiers are fighting so much that they had to be separated “per scansare l’occasione di qualche rissa e discordia che avesse potuto succedere, come spesso avviene tra nazione e nazione” ""to avoid the occasion of some brawl and discord that could have happened, as often happens between nation and nation"". It's always tricky to apply modern values and points of view to the past, but to me, these don't sound like the words of someone that thinks that Spain and Italy are just geographic areas.","Veneto, Italy",/r/europe/comments/iwe0f4/on_this_day_150_years_ago_the_italian_army/g7ca9t0/,Giallo555,1601593143

3163,"&gt;After the UK made it clear that all EU product requirements were free to be broken. And absoluly no EU laws would be followed by the future UK.

The UK didn't make that clear at all (indeed the UK has been pretty happy to say that there will be no regression) and in any case that isn't particularly relevant. The EU agreed that NI would be part of the UK market and customs area, making that a practical impossibility was never going to simply be ignored by the UK.

&gt;Given the UKs argument has always been we are starting from the same base. And the EUs argument has always been we need to protect the stability of our market.

Sure, but again, in terms of the N.I. protocol it shouldn't matter for goods remaining on the UK side. Even beyond that (given the UK's position on non-regression..) its not a problem for the EU at this point, which suggests an attempt to use it as a lever.

&gt;Suggesting this was started by the EU is just childish. The UK has from day one of the referendum result. Been argueing for mutually exclusive rights.

I might be missing something. But if we get a trade deal doesnt it supersede the WA and replace it, in which case they are unlikely to pursue us for breaking the WA, I would think. Seems to me that as a negotiating tactic ( and presumably in case there is no deal)  we threaten to break the WA to pressure  the EU into further compromise in the trade negotiation, and they counter by starting proceedings to threaten to punish us if we do renege  -  but if there is a deal I imagine we will all move on.

If their isnt then they will eventually have the legal right to use trade sanctions to punish us , if they so choose. I am not sure why you think their sanction threats are toothless. I hope it isnt just the old they need our trade more than we theirs -  because wasnt that why this would be the easiest of trade deals. My understanding is that they will have a legal right to sanction us - whether they choose to do so in the end , I dont know.

Some of them may be islamists but others are just civilians that had no jobs and no means of subsistence in Syria and were offered ""security jobs"" in Azerbaijan for 2000 USD, and when they got there they were put in trucks and sudenly found themselves in the front lines of a war. They're forced mercenaries, and nothing more than canon fodder for Turkey and Azerbaijan. It's fucking disgusting. The ones that die quickly probably won't even see a cent nor will their families.

well, if you didn't want people to talk about independence again, you shouldn't have forced through a massive change in the conditions of the Scottish membership of the UK without its consent. The government of Scotland was against the EU referendum in the first place, and was not even consulted by the May govt (or Johnson for that matter). 

Not to mention that the IMB tramples on the devolved govts and their powers and breaks the Sewel convention that the parliament of the UK can only legislate on devolved powers with the explicit consent of the devolved adiministrations.

The Aegean sea, especially on the part where oil was found (not the north part) is full of islands pretty close to each  other. Heck the biggest island (crete) is there.

The state stealing an established institution from its founder and owner has 'nothing to do' with it it? Sounds like a pretty big logic leap, if you asked me.

&gt;Nobody should be controling these institutions, neither people who advocate against deities, nor those who advocate for them.

Someone founds those institution, and then gets to somewhat control them. That's how western culture works. If you don't like catholic universities, you can go to non-catholic ones.

&gt;having laws based on religious teachings, like criminalizing gay relationships, or sexual intercourse out of wedlock, abortions, drinking alcohol(in the case of islam), or what people can wear,

Laws regulation lierally all of those issues can (and in fact do in many countries) exist without any underlying religious motivation behind them whatsoever.

&gt;And religious dogma should have no place in educational institutions

Everyone should be free to found their own educational institution. If they meet enough standards, they might even participate in funding!

&gt;Belief is a personal matter and should not be dictated by the state or the society within which you live.

A belief ironically most often repeated by those, who themselves want to dictate their narrow interpretation of social justice and progressivism on everyone else, including the state and society they live in.

&gt;You can also have religious private schools, but in no way should those be state-funded

Oh, finally some sense from you after all this word salad. Though they obviously should be eligible for state funding, if they fulfil the same conditions other institutions do.

3718,"&gt; it had little relevance

No, it didn't, as it was Ukrainian SSR who was responsible for rebuilding Crimea. Soviet Union was a federal state with each entity having their own civilian budgets. Ukrainian SSR also transferred certain lands to Russian SSR in exchange, and I don't see them being returned to Ukraine after Russia annexed Crimea. 

&gt; Ukraine was illegal occupier

Not really an occupier, much rather friendly neighbor, as Ukraine in the last 30 years supported Tatars, encouraged their cultural programs and institutions, mass media and guaranteed the use of their language legally, whilst Russia is discriminating Tatars and arresting those that do not adhere to their vision of ""Russian Crimea"". Tatars supported Ukraine, they do not support Russia. See the difference?

 &gt; That was only satire

It was a dumb satire, if it was one. My point was that secession was not legal, according to Ukrainian and Crimean law. You claimed it was legal, which was false. Where's satire in that? Please explain, as I genuinely fail to understand it. 

You can believe that they had the moral right to secede and join Russia, but it was not legal. I fail to understand how can you argue with that.

You mentioned 1994 constitution.  You failed to mention that after political crisis and negotiations, Crimeans OKd a constitution that reaffirmed Crimea being an inseparable part of Ukraine in 1998. You also failed to mention that precious attempts of carving up Ukraine were organized and financed by Russia, just like in 2014. The difference was, Russia was too weak back then to succeed. Crimean Tatars took a direct part in securing the territory back then.

3736,"&gt; I love the irony of this statement. Claims to be against nationalism and states how stupid it is, then proceed to talk about how Armenians should be kicked out of their homes, because Stalin gave it to Azerbaijan for no logical reason whatsoever and UN (who ignores Yemeni children getting killed because of Saudi funding) ""recognized"" it.

I see your point but I am not the one who decides it. If we need to have a reference point today, I think it makes sense to take internationally recognized borders into consideration. Since the area belongs to the country of Azerbaijan then their government &amp; people should be allowed to run those lands as they please. Again, I am not advocating any harm upon Armenian people living in Azerbaijan. I'm just saying it should be understandable why Azerbaijan is trying to get back its land. The rest and how it should proceed is always open to debate.

&gt; And why on earth should Azeris from Nahkchivan lose their homes? How is this helping anyone?

I'm not saying this is the best solution but I am pretty sure any sane person would be much happier with thousands of relocated people into new cities compared to thousands of dead people with no life to live. It can be difficult for the people experiencing it but it can prevent a generational war and future sorrow.

&gt; P.S. calling for the eradication of an entire ethnic group and claiming Yerevan as ""Ancient Azeri land"" is not the same thing as displacing Azeri civilians.

I love the way you put it that way... it almost sounds cute! ""Displacing Azeri civilians"" involved massacres, you know that, right? But oh, sure, Armenians never did anything wrong during the war... Whenever an Armenian got killed, it was a bloody genocide; but when civilians were rounded up and killed by Armenian forces during the war, it was just an unpleasant event, right? 

That's the problem with this sub. Most arguments can't go beyond ""bird country bad"" and bringing up the other side of the story is discredited with the pretext of whataboutism. I am definitely NOT advocating a displacement of Armenians like back in 90s. That would be extremely brutal. Nobody deserves that treatment.

Not to mention that, for the longest time, there was a strong added bias to it. None of your examples have gone trough even a slightly comparable stigmatization.

For a very long time troughout history, ""Balkan"" was used as a synonim to ""backwards people"", especially before, during and after WW2. 

The stigmatization of the term started when the Germans wanted to portray the southern neighbours of Austria as backwards, then Nazi Germany used it to further drive home the point of Balkan people being lesser and ""uncivilized"", and then the western world picked up and carried that torch due to anti-communist sentiments towards yugoslavia. 

But no longer are the Balkans uncivilized, no longer are the Balkans communist and no longer is it acceptable in our society to view others as lesser... and with this change, no longer should a word with such a history be used.

These people ... have no right to live in this region. Modern Armenia was built on historical Azerbaijani lands.

Nagorno-Karabakh is internationally recognized as a part of Azerbaijan. Simple as that. Armenians living there are the result of Azeris being displaced in the 90s after the war. Unlike Armenian claims based on which you'd think that the entire world was Armenian at some point, that piece of land did not come to emergence with Armenians on top of it.

Look, I am not advocating for a military operation and forceful displacement of Armenians living in the area but I simply don't understand how Azerbaijan can be regarded as the aggressor when the war is literally being fought on their own soil and the area belongs to them.

It is quite obvious that no one is happy with the status quo. One way or another, a solution has to be found to end this conflict. They should act like two civilized countries and try to settle this mess instigated by Stalin. Fuck your ""historical land"" argument, people are dying for this every day. I don't know, maybe give Nakhchivan to Armenia in exchange for getting full control of Nagorno-Karabakh but nah, neither Armenians nor Azerbaijani are mature enough to settle for something like that.

Right now, there's a fairly-undefined set of requirements that can lead to Article 7ing a member, which is the most-severe thing one can do.  I mean, the point of having a written code of law is so that the thing doesn't get applied arbitrarily.

Obviously, there are always gonna be obscure corner cases, but I mean…the basics aren't even set down.

Also, while the ""rule of law"" thing has caught attention because of the Poland/Hungary spat, I'd add that ""human dignity"" is another EU value with the same legal implications in the treaties:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_7_of_the_Treaty_on_European_Union

3922," ""**Polish** *październik* comes from *paździerz* = “hemp or flax shives”, which used to be produced in October. **Belarusian** *kastrýčnik* is derived from *kastra*, which also refers to “hemp and flax shives”. **Lithuanian** *spalis* is derived from *spaliai*, yet another word for “flax shives”.

**Ukrainian** *žóvten’* is a month of “yellowing” of trees. **Czech** *říjen* derives from *říje*, “rut” (rutting period of animals). **Croatian** *listopad* literally means “leaves-fall”, i.e. “the month of falling leaves” (but the same word, “listopad”, means “November” in Polish and Czech).

**Turkish** *ekim* means “sowing”. **Albanian** *tetor* is derived from the Latin name by replacing *octo* with *tet(ë)* (“eight” in Albanian), which, however, ultimately comes from the same Proto-Indo-European root as *octo*.

**Irish** *Deireadh Fómhair* can be translated as “end of autumn” or “end of harvest”. **Welsh** *Hydref* literally means “autumn” and is likely derived from *hydd* (“stag”) + *bref* (“lowing; bleating”). **Breton** *Here* and **Cornish** *Hedra* are derived from the same root. **Scottish Gaelic** *dàmhair* means “rut” (rutting period of animals).

**Sardinian** *santugaine* (sometimes also spelled *Santu Gaine* or *Santu ‘Aine*) is derived from the name of Saint Gavinus, a Sardinian martyr; *ladamini* comes ultimately from Latin *laetāmen* (“dung, manure”) because October used to be the month of fertilization of fields.

**Finnish** *lokakuu*, **Karelian** *ligakuu*, and **Veps** *reduku* literally mean “mud month” or “dirt month”. **Võro** *rehekuu* means “threshing month”. **Northern Sami** *golggotmánnu* means “rut month” (and the corresponding words in most other Sami languages are likely cognates). **Komi** *jirym tolys’* probably means “cold weather month”.

3969,"In 2019, the EU imported 3.0 million tonnes of coffee from abroad, 14% more than 10 years ago. These imports were worth €7.5 billion.

Most of the coffee imported in 2019 from non-EU countries came from two countries: Brazil (932 000 tonnes imported to the EU, or 31% of the total extra-EU imports) and Vietnam (673 000 tonnes, 22%). They were followed by Honduras (221 000 tonnes, 7%), Colombia (166 000 tonnes, 6%), Uganda (145 000 tonnes, 5%), India (137 000 tonnes, 5%), Peru (113 000 tonnes, 4%), Ethiopia and Switzerland (both 80 000 tonnes, 3%) as well as Indonesia (77 000 tonnes, 3%).

These imports were mainly into Germany (with 1.1 million tonnes imported, or 37% of the total extra-EU imports) and Italy (604 000 tonnes, 20%), ahead of Belgium (303 000 tonnes, 10%), Spain (273 000 tonnes, 9%) and France (236 000 tonnes, 8%). 

**Germany and Italy, top coffee producers**

In 2019, over 1.8 million tonnes of coffee were produced in the EU, 3% more than 10 years ago. The EU’s coffee production was worth around €10 billion, and it was equivalent to around 4.1 kilograms per inhabitant in 2019.

Among the EU Member States, Germany produced the most roasted coffee in 2019 (572 000 tonnes, or 31% of the total EU production), followed by Italy (508 000 tonnes, 28%), ahead of Spain (143 000 tonnes, 8%), the Netherlands (136 000 tonnes, 7%), France (133 000 tonnes, 7%), and Sweden (91 000 tonnes, 5%).

In 2019, these six EU Member States produced 86% of the total EU production of roasted coffee.

4026,"&gt;That isn't what happend at all, it was the Arab spring remember the wave of protests that overthrew various middle eastern dictators, in Syria when they tried to overthrow Assad they didn't have enough momentum to overthrow him so they dug in and the whole thing turned into a drawn out civil war. 

And who do you think, gave the insurgents the support they needed to have a chance of doing it in the first place? The ""Free Syrian army""(FSA) That would later wage war on the Bashar Al Assad regime, sat for a good while across the border in Turkey, receiving arms, training and inteligence from Turkey, U.S, Qatar, Saudi Arabia etc... under the pretense of ""protecting the people"", ""overthrowing a brutal regime"", ""fighting for the rights and safety of the Syrian people"" they have started the fight and plunged the country into chaos. 

It was relized that violent anti-Assad protests were also organized by the opposition long before the FSA gained any traction, using the natural dissasters that befell syria to gain momentum, Only for all of us to later learn, the real goal of the FSA was not Democracy, or overthrowing an opressive dictator, but to replace him with another beast and plunge the nation into a theocracy under Sharia.

&gt;The US (under Obama) with Iraq still fresh in his mind basically said not our problem and refused to get involved and the shit show in Syria has now being going on for almost a decade.

You think the U.S wasn't involved in the conflict in Syria?... mate... they're still there, complaining about the Russians being there. Did you forget they launched a joint cruise missile attack on Syria with France and Britain in tow? Or Hillary Clintons campaign promise to establish either a no-fly zone or aeirial superiority by the U.S there? Or that they're ocupying oil fields there (which btw are so tiny they're a drop in the bucket and worthless, compared to the whole fosile fuel industry of the U.S) Or how they now decided that the Kurds aren't worth it and decided intead to go with Turkey.

If you think we, together with the U.S, had nothing to do with the Arab springs popping up all over the middle east, I'm sorry to say but, you're being naive..",,/r/europe/comments/j2xea8/macron_calls_on_europe_to_quit_dependency_on_us/g78yf0u/,YourLovelyMother,1601520837

a) many countries that are against the pipeline, have a higher share of Russian gas than Germany. One country for example is Poland..... when there was a debate about Nord Stream 1, Poland suggestwd to increase the capacity of Yamal instead...yes building a pipeline with the Russians is super evil and Germany is so mean, blablabla but when the pipeline goes through their country it is absolutely no problem... Fuck that shit, I don't understand why Germany is shamed so much by polish politicians when Poland has a higher share of Russian gas imports. 

This whole thing is just political theater. 

b) the amount of gas piped to Germany will not increase that dramatically just the route it takes, even the fucking soviet union supplied WEST Germany with gas. Germany will continue to have a diverse range of suppliers, it is very obviously not in the interest of Germany to make themselves dependent on Russian gas. 

c) it is just about taking a more direct route, Russia Belarus and Ukraine already had many disputes, it is just unwise from a German perspective to not seek to establish more direct gas pipelines. You can not predict the future, maybe some gas pipeline will explode, some crazy lunatics gets elected in a country with a pipeline etc... 

d) now about the actual project: the Germany company involved will make a revenue about 1.4% of the whole project....""GeRmAnY is FuNdInG evil Russian projects"".....some other companies involved are from France for example but bashing France is boring they were not the nazis... 

e) Germany has done much more for the well-being of the people in Ukraine, Belarus, Russia and elsewhere than anyone who is crying about the gas right now...

Merkel was responsible for the Minsk treatys that stopped the fights in Eastern Ukraine, she has recently visited Navalny when he was in Berlin in a Hospital.

Nope.

Don't you notice all these reputable international media articles posted everywhere never mention anything about Armenia invading or occupying? This post includes a photo from the BBC. Do they mention anything about Nagorno Karabakh being occupied? Why is that? Do you have an explanation?

You even say it yourself without realising it:

&gt; Azerbaijan is not, legally, waging a war against Armenia

The reason is very simple: Because Armenia does not occupy any territories as per the UN Security Council. The surrounding territories (which can be seen in the image in this post) is recognised to have been invaded by the Nagorno Karabakh itself.

4244,"&gt; The Azeri and Turkish language is also mutually intelligable.

Indeed. Same ethnicity and language in all but name. Local dialects from the Turkish-Azerbaijan borderland regions are more or less the same, closer to each other than the officially state mandated languages of each country (especially of the Turkish Turks living there to Istanbul/Ankara Turkish). 

In the olden days both languages would have been basically the same, before modern nation-states and standardised and centralised language standards disseminated via mass media and education.

And also in the olden days Azerbaijanis called themselves Turk/Turki as their main ethnonym, in Iran I think it's more common to identify in this way than in Azerbaijan proper. 

We are the same ethnic group, initially both under the Seljuks. Then the difference is that our ancestors lived in the Ottoman Empire, their ancestors lived under the Turkic Empires that ruled Iran and surrounding areas. So that caused this diversion to occur especially in the modern age of nation-states and centralisation that further hardened and consolidated the differences. 

In modern times Turkish media is popular in Azerbaijan, particularly among the youth. Young Azerbaijanis who consume Turkish media can basically speak the Istanbul Turkish language just as well as a native Turkish Turk with no obvious Azerbaijani accent, they code switch easily between the two.

4262,"1. Partly true. Yes, it didn't have any meaning in practical administration of A-H, but it was not a dead concept and it did serve as a base for future Czechoslovak borders. After all, Czechoslovak territorial claims beyond historical borders were denied for that reason.

2. Carpathian Ruthenia joined Czechoslovakia after the voting in the Hucul Republic, not as a result of the American vote. It was a similar process as with Slovaks. Of course, just like in the case of Slovakia, there were pro-indepence voices, but those were not a majority and the coexistence within the state was peaceful. Rusyns indeed considered Ukraine as an alternative, but remaining part of Hungary was preferred by, well, Hungarians, who were a minority, so saying that Rusyns wanted to join Hungary is misleading at best. 

3. My mistake there, haven't checked detailed enough map, only text. 

4.

4274,"I was wrong about the 14%.(I always do the same mistake...). It's 6% for the first ten years after the solution, 12% for years 10-14, and 18% until then 19th year after the solution. The constituent state will still have the right to limit the establishment of Cypriot citizens who do not hold the internal constituent state citizenship status until Turkey joins the EU(so...). So the limitations could stay forever. (There is also another limitation that is unrelated with the above that says that the Constituent state has the right to take measures to ensure than no less than 2/3 of it's Cypriot permanent citizens speak turkish as its mother tongue).

But you don't believe (it's a pretty big document, it took me hours to read it about a year ago). 

You can find the info about what I say in the ""Foundation Agreement, Annex II, Attachment 3"".

As you said it is ridiculous(so ridiculous that you can't even believe that I am not lying) and as you can check yourself it's not a claim. (there are similar limitations when it comes to owning/buying property.) 

It's 21% but have in mind that the Greek Cypriot side had to accept that the big number of turkish settlers that came jn Cyprus illegally(violating the 4th Geneva Convention) would remain in Cyprus after a solution (and become citizens of the United Cyprus). Even though the UN Resolution asked the withdrawal of all settlers, Greek Cypriot today agreed that they will remain in Cyprus.(the 100% uncompromising GCs).

There is a difference between have two states with the same status(all state of America/Germany/Austria are equal). In the Federal level things are different but Turkish Cypriots will be overrepresented for their percentage of population. But as I said these things were already accepted by the 100% uncompromising GC side. There are two main disagreements regarding the power sharing. One is rotating presidency(that will ve accepted in return of something else) and the other is the 'positive vote'. The turkish side insists that for every single decision made by any federal organ one turkish Cypriot vote is required. The GC side accepted that at least one TC vote is required for the Council of Ministers. The GC side also accepted that one positive TC vote can be required for issues that will affect the vital interests of the Turkish Cypriot Community or the Turkish Cypriot federated state(so the Greek Cypriots can't take any decision that would negatively affect TCs). The point here is that the TC side doesn't accept negotiation on these because they are considered necessary.


But again these two aren't the main problems.

The main disagreements is about turkish troops and guarantees. Greek Cypriots don't want to become a puppet state of Turkey. They don't want Turkey to have a say in the internal issues of Cyprus. How will GC accept a solution in which the turkish army that has kept them so long away from their houses, occupying their villages, remain in the island? How can they trust Turkey, that have kicked them out of their houses, being a 'guarantor power'? Turkey, Greece and UK shouldn't be guarantors powers. All of these countries violated the Treaty of Guarantee. Cyprus is a full member of the United Nations and the European Union. No country today has ""guarantor powers"".

You say there is a ""Turkish Cypriot President"" that supports reunification. When it comes to these two issues Mustafa Akinci is powerless. The leader of the Turkish Cypriot Community doesn't have a say on this. Even if Akinci and Anastasiades agree on everything without Turkey's consent nothing happens. Turkey must abolish the guarantor rights, Turkey must withdraw it's army out of Cyprus.

Turkey is drilling in the Cypriot EEZ. Not just in the north, not just in the west, but also south of Cyprus. If this happened other EU country, EU would respond with sanctions (imagine Russia doing the same to Estonia).

You still believe that GCs don't want reunification, that GCs don't want to return to their homes, that GCs aren't compromising. You are being ignorant.

&gt;but you still sound very unwilling to cooperate. What even do you want?

Not sure how I am unwilling to cooperate.. Unless in your opinion accepting all these is just too little and cooperation for you means agree with everything we ask you so we can find a solution. No other community with that percentage of population has all these rights and the GC side accepted those. Why doesn't Turkey give these rights to Kurds too? Or North Macedonia to Albanians? Or Estonia to Russians?

Yes, Azeris were killed; but they were killed in war, not because the Armenian government hunted them down and killed them. Khojaly, for example, was after a major military offensive, and rogue soldiers who had just seen Armenian civilians relentlessly bombed wanted revenge. Did the government condone them? No, on the contrary they thought what had happened was horrible. Ask any Armenian today if they think what happened that day was right, and they will tell you that it was shameful and that anybody who partook in that shouldn't even be considered Armenian. But how many Azeris feel shame over the Sumgait and Baku pogroms? How many accept that what happened in Nakhichevan was a crime against humanity? Not to mention that Baku and Sumgait are arguably worse since they were far from the front lines, and that the Azeri government (which I'm glad you consider to be horrible) encouraged it. 

As for why Armenians are so stubborn about Artsakh: we have lost Western Armenia and we have lost Nakhichevan; but we will not lose, under any circumstances, one of the last remaining Armenian territories, especially since it still has an Armenian majority.

Did you learn a lot about the foibe but also a lot about the Italian concentration camps for Slovenes, Croats and Jews in Italy?

Because for now it seems to me that while Italians are allways very well aware of the Foiba where hundreds died, they don't seem to know much about killing thousands in their own camps.

I remember there was a T.V show in Italy talking about repressions of Italians and showed a picture for which it was claimed ""on this picture we see partisans shooting unarmed Italian civilians in the back"", a guest historian had to correct them.

Italy is doing a lot of revisionism, and part of that revisionism is this idea that we celebrate the killings, we most certainly don't... and also, how is denying bad history a ""good"" thing?

PS: Fun fact.. Italian and Slovene historians and anthropologists search the foibas on a nearly monthly(less now due to pandemic) basis with slovene cavers. How much work, do you think.. is being done in Italy to discover the fates of all the Slovenes that vanished to Italy from our country, and all those that dissapeared around, and in Trieste?

I know the answer and could tell you, but I'm currious what you think.

It took 80 years for Italy to even acknowledge there were Slovene institutions burned down across the border, 80 years to give us back the apropriated cultural center.

I mean... we here already know what was going on, do you?

Ofcourse Italy can't be compared to Germany or Japan in the sheer scale of the Genocide, but nonetheless, it cost a lot of people their lives. You said Germans atleast feel bad for what they did... well, do you? 

You know Germans after the war suffered the lat
Rgest exodus ever seen in Europe? Would it then, be fair of Germans to say, ""hey, you guys are worse because you did that to the German diaspora!"" ? Because that's what you were saying in Italys defense.

4294,"Nagorno Karabakh is a region that has been de facto independent since the Soviet break up. Nagorno Karabakh  is and has historically been Armenian populated. It decided for independence by a referendum which was overwhelmingly successful. A big motivation for the separation was the ethnic cleansing of Armenians throughout Azerbaijan. Armenians did not want to be part of a country that was killing them.

However the region was assigned to Azerbaijan SSR by the Soviets during the 1920s, and thus Azerbaijan still asserts territorial integrity.

This led to conflict where Arstakh was able to defend most of Nagorno Karabakh, but also captured some surrounding territory. The surrounding territory is said to provide a security buffer and to provide a strong land connection to Armenia; This is in context of the 1991-1992 blockade, starvation and shelling of the people of the capital Stepanakert, including her trapped citizens.

Armenia has been willing to cede the surrounding regions if Artsakh is recognised. The logic is that they don't need a security buffer if Arstakh is recognised and peace is guaranteed. Until then Artsakh and it's people are at risk, as you see now.

Romania is made by 3 main regions(Valahia,Transilvania and Moldavia).The Moldavian chronicles preserved several variants of the legend of Dragoș's hunting for an aurochs or bison, ending with his ""dismounting"" by the Moldova River, which gave rise to the development of Moldavia.

The legend said that during the hunt he striked the bison with an arrow,the bison managed to cross the river nearby to escape and Dragos's dog named ""Molda"" tried to follow the bison but drawn.

After Dragos killed the bison he named the region after his dog(Molda to Moldavia).Thats why the Romanian part of Moldova(was ripped in half by russians) still has a bison on its flag(top right corner)

4393,"Oh God, I obviusly know it, I know it very well and it was just an exaggeration

I know they started the accession process several years ago but now it has practically stopped, not completely like Turkey but it's going bad (in the meantime Montenegro continued closing chapters and Albania and North Macedonia finally got the process started)

One of the worst thing is that the Serbian president (elected and supported by serbian people/parties, obviusly) is even worse than Orban and Duda, and is helping to make the country a ""puppet"" of Russia and China, further and further away from the European Union and instead one of the biggest threat for it (military exercitations with Russia say something? And billionaire affairs with China?) 

Another important thing is that serbian population is really ""hostile"" particularly towards Croatia, Bosnia, Albania (and I won't mention Kosovo...). And even your comment was aggressive, but no problems. But really, if you hate other countries, those other countries will hate you, but then also the neutral ones will do it

Just in February/March there were some meeting to talk about (and change) the accession methodology, and if I remember correcly also in June/July, maybe later I'll search some articles about it

And perhaps you haven't noticed that democracy, people rights, the population approval towards the Eu and even country's reputation (Vučić... Albania is lucky to have Rama, because also their reputation is quite terrible) is fundamental to join the European Union, even more than economic data (but obviusly that doesn't mean that they will accept countries with €3,000 gdp per capita...) 

I have no doubt, however, that Serbia will be able to join, but certainly not before 2030 and probably even Bosnia will do it faster

And believe me, Denmark and Netherlands will do everything possible not to let them in (and I don't think they will be the only ones to completely opposed, I'm thinking also about Austria, Sweden and France)",Italy,/r/europe/comments/j2hvn5/nato_chief_tells_georgian_pm_to_prepare_for/g77v6u5/,MG-10,1601499130

Now I asked, who would you vote for? The dead mayor or the mayor that got buthurt that he won the elections by a slim margin?

The example you gave isn't public opinion because statistics show that Turkish Cypriots support a reunification and don't hold that strong of animosity towards Greek Cypriots

Greek Cypriots really don't act like they want a solution. Recent referendums show that they overwhelmingly don't want reunification. While the Northern Cyprus government has popular support for reunification, Cypriot political parties are rather split. The Northern Cypriot president even said he didn't want Northern Cyprus to become Turkey's Crimea, which ironically annoyed Turkish officials.

Of course I know what the Annan plan was. It was revised 4 times because Greek Cypriots couldn't accept the terms. Just to be clear btw, I would support a more integrated Cyprus than what the Annan plan offers with the two states under one federal Cypriot government.

This doesn't tell me much since your state still denies the genocide.

4656,"&gt; The ECJ is made up of humans so it's also political and biased.

its judges are at least *supposed to* put the law, above their personal opinion, even if there aren't ways to force them. Politicians do not have such obligations.

&gt;The ECJ isn't elected and has no democratic mandate.

In no EU state are judges, even constitutional judges, elected. Yet they enjoy higher legitimacy than politicians, as they are required to justify in a rigourous manner their decisions for them to be effective.

&gt;The European Parliament is the only institution thats elected by it's citiziens and thus has a democratic mandate.

The allegations against Hungary are of legal nature, that it violated its commitments to the Rule of Law. But if the Rule of Law is supposed to be distinct from mere democracy, it is that legal questions and interprations are decided by legal experts, independent of the popular opinion.

&gt;Most importantly, the ideas behind democracy, human rights and rule of law have changed over time, so having unelected bureaucrats defining those terms is highly undemocratic.

The EP and EC are only slightly less unelected by Hungary, as the ECJ judges. Hungary elects only a couple of EPs, the majority is elected by non-Hungarians.

In the EU, there are 2 things you need to declare: ingredients and nutritional values.

If sugar is ""used up"", you would have to list it as an ingredient, but if its actually consumed by a chemical process, it wouldnt be listed under nutritional values I assume?

If the rich high emission countries don't take the first steps, why should anybody else do it as well.

Besides, if we ever reach a point where the emissions in the EU fall below that of China, we can add CO2 tariffs on top of the goods and force China to clean up.

Which quite frankly is one of the best methods to make a change, make a universal trade rule (that counts for everybody). If China doesn't play ball, the local industries get a competitive advantage. If China does play ball, the world wins.

Higher emission standards are not a disadvantage, they are an advantage as they keep cheaper competition out while making the local products more desirable.

""Made in Germany"" was created to prevent the cheap products of the old enemy from overtaking the local production. It became a mark of quality that people specifically shop for, even if the products are more expensive.

Germany tried to stop the events by closing the locations (they claimed it was for safety I think) and the Netherlands clearly said they didn't allow them to come. So what did Turkey do? They sneaked their minister into Rotterdam using multiple vehicles as distraction and had the consulate host the event anyway. The mayor of Rotterdam had her escorted out of the city by police while the minister started playing the victim. She even said we violated international law (while it was kinda the other way around). What followed was a rioted near the Turkish consulate where Turkish protesters where told to disperse (it was pretty late and they were making a lot of noise), but instead they started throwing rocks and breaking windows. So the police did a cavalry charge to disperse them and used dogs to arrest some. Erdogan of course knew this would happen and in the next few weeks he started calling us nazi's and some other stuff. Turkish media was especially mad about the horses and dogs for some reason. I am pretty sure Turkish police is rougher when it comes to riot suppression but whatever lol.

5019,"That's an EU-wide ban. The NPR article just focuses on Denmark because the Muslim immigrant community was challenging the law there, due to it differing from their halal slaughter methods.

You're not well-read on the subject, you've just come across a few articles and a few headlines here and there, and you're filling in the blanks, assuming the worst or most backwards things for Southern Europe. 

Southern Europeans historically have eaten little meat and a varied diet that includes more vegetables, fish, olive oil; Northern Europeans have historically been the bigger meat eaters, and also relied much more on animal fats for cooking. The high meat-consumption in Spain and France is a more recent thing, as is the veganism in Germanic countries. Northern Europeans are just swinging from one extreme to the other. And whatever they do, you'll see it as ""better"", even if it's something Southern Europeans already do, have done, or used to do. Like wine or outdoor dining, when Northern Europeans and Americans start to do it, then it's cool.

Animal rights legislation varies in Southern Europe. Spain is the only country that's still seriously struggling with it, due to protectionism for bullfighting; even so it's become unpopular in most regions these days, and unpopular with younger generations. At the other end, Greece is very animal protectionist; even dog pounds are considered inhumane. Unlike the US or Northern Europe where putting down unadopted strays is not an issue, this is considered unacceptable to the animal rights activists in Greece. So, instead, they inoculate and neuter strays, put a collar on them, and release them back into the city.",,/r/europe/comments/j270bh/france_to_ban_use_of_wild_animals_in_circuses/g75ehtg/,skyduster88,1601447770

5082,"&gt;On August 11, Russia announced the registration of the world’s first coronavirus vaccine, named “Sputnik V” by its developers at Gamaleya National Research Institute of Epidemiology. According to the terms of the drug’s registration, the vaccine’s developers must conduct large-scale “phase III” clinical trials on tens of thousands of volunteers. Meduza special correspondent Svetlana Reiter agreed to be one of these test subjects. We asked her to catalog the vaccine’s effects on her body and describe what it’s like to participate in such a momentous clinical study. Here is her diary.
Svetlana Reiter

&gt;I completed a questionnaire at mos.ru the same day that my daughter contracted rotavirus. I was in late August while we were staying in the countryside. We were sharing a home with my parents, who were living downstairs. They’re both over 65 and at risk for coronavirus. My daughter was vomiting all night, while I was running up and down the stairs with paper towels, cleaner, Rehydron, water, and clean sheets. I knew that coronavirus can start in kids exactly the same way. I was afraid that my daughter would infect my parents and they would die. If there’s a vaccine, someone has to take the risk or this nightmare will never end, I reasoned. 

&gt;My daughter recovered after a day, but I still sent off the questionnaire. 

&gt;I’d learned about the coronavirus vaccine from more than just the news. My colleague, Meduza science editor Alexander Ershov, and I interviewed Denis Logunov, the researcher at the Gamaleya Center who led the vaccine’s development. For what it was worth, I’d actually laid eyes on the person responsible for this vaccine.

&gt;September 14

&gt;It all starts with a phone call: “Ms. Reiter? Your application has been selected for participation in the study. Please come to outpatient clinic number 46 on Kazakov Street for screening.”

&gt;It’s clean and virtually empty in the wing where they examine the volunteers. First, there’s a fairly formal examination by a general practitioner: “Let’s listen to your lungs. Does it hurt anywhere? Roll up your sleeve, we need to measure your blood pressure. Do you have any allergies? Are you on any medications?” Then the tests begin. You hand over urine in a jar so they can rule out three factors: alcohol, drugs, and pregnancy. They take your blood, too, to test for coronavirus antibodies, hepatitis C, and HIV. They also do a PCR [polymerase chain reaction] test for coronavirus. 

&gt;I’m tested on September 14. When I show up, the line of volunteers isn’t very long — just a dozen or so people, all wearing their masks correctly. The clinic wing has its own reception desk, where three young women are working behind the counter. They explain that I’ll be excluded from the study if my test results show coronavirus antibodies. If they find no antibodies, I can come back on September 21 for the vaccination. According to the rules, volunteers are supposed to be vaccinated on the second or third day after their tests, but the lab works slowly, the health workers tell me.

&gt;I tried to speak to as many employees at the clinic as I could, and they all said they’d had COVID. One of them spent two weeks in the hospital with a fever above 40 degrees Celsius [104 degrees Fahrenheit], while another simply tested positive for antibodies. 

&gt;After the examination, I read through the 17-page voluntary consent form. The study will last 180 days. There will be two injections, three weeks apart. The day before the first shot, I can’t consume any alcohol or play sports. For the next six months, I’ll need to curb my physical activity. Smoking more than 10 cigarettes in a day is prohibited. 

&gt;If I die, the study’s organizers — the Gamaleya Center and the Moscow city government — will pay my relatives 2 million rubles [$25,260]. If the vaccine renders me disabled, the payout is 1.5 million rubles [$18,935].

&gt;I tested negative for antibodies. I’ll be back for the vaccine on September 21.

&gt;September 21
12:45 p.m.

&gt;The line at the clinic stretches the entire hallway. People registered for shots at 10 a.m. aren’t admitted to the office until 1 p.m., at best. New volunteers are also waiting in the same hallway for their exams.

&gt;A tall, gray-haired man of about 60 rushes into the office holding a container of urine. He says he’s in a hurry because he works as a “Gazprom ENT specialist.” The mood is tense. Tests for some volunteers aren’t ready yet, but they’ve already been scheduled to get the vaccine. They turn around and leave. 

&gt;In line, there are people as young as 30 and others in their 70s. I wait beside a middle-aged brunette woman whose sister and elderly mother have self-quarantined since late March. So she can see them, she’s decided to take part in the vaccine study. Conversations between volunteers often begin with the phrase: “Turns out I don’t have COVID and I’ve even got a certificate to prove it!” 


&gt;1:45 p.m.

&gt;A film crew from Rossiya 24 shows up to record a segment, showing the line of volunteers. “The third phase of research on a coronavirus vaccine is underway in Moscow. We’re looking at the tests now, the results of which the entire country eagerly awaits,” the reporter says. A doctor walks out from one of the offices and mutters, “So they’re showing off again how great everything is?” A nurse leads an elderly volunteer to the exit and says, “Grandpa, you sat down and rest for an hour after your shot. It’s better now if you go. It’s Armageddon here now.”


&gt;2:45 p.m.

&gt;It’s my turn. The general practitioner conducts another quick examination: temperature, blood pressure, any pain? No? Then it’s time for the shot.

&gt;The nurse administers the injection. She checks the number on my signed informed consent form against the number on the list attached to the refrigerator with the vaccines. 


&gt;2:46 p.m.

&gt;The nurse takes a vial from a box labeled “Gam-COVID-Vac” [trade-named “Sputnik V”] and gives me an injection in my left shoulder. 

&gt;I leave the room and take a seat in the hallway, as instructed, just in case I become suddenly ill. 


&gt;3:46 p.m.

&gt;I go to schedule my second injection.

&gt;At the counter, there’s a man, blond, about 40 years old, wearing a mask, and causing a scene. “I was tested! I have the antibodies! And they sent me to you for a vaccination!” he yells. “Who sent you here from where?” the nurse asks him. “They forced me to sign up at work!” he answers. 

&gt;When I ask the man where he works, he falls silent. The nurse tells me: “Don’t look so surprised. We’ve got a lot of people like this here from state-funded institutions. There are also people who came here on their own, of course.” 

&gt;After getting the vaccine, they explain at the registry desk, volunteers need to install the app “Check Covid-19” and submit diary entries on certain days. As I leave the building, I see a woman in her 60s complain that she doesn’t understand how to use the app. “Do you have a grandson at home? He’ll set it all up for you,” the health workers tell her.

&gt;September 22

&gt;10:00 a.m.

&gt;My head is spinning and I feel weak. The spot where I got the shot is a little sore. 

&gt;In total, the study involves 40,000 volunteers, a quarter of whom will get a placebo. This is probably the hardest thing psychologically: you won’t know until the end if you were inoculated. You start tracking your symptoms, thinking your head is spinning, and wondering if it’s really spinning. You’ve got a headache, but is it the vaccine or just nerves? You wish you’d exchanged numbers with the other volunteers. It would be great to compare symptoms, now that everyone is in the same boat. 
11:00 a.m.

&gt;You start reading every news story you can find about all the different vaccines. They’ve halted the AstraZeneca Oxford trials again after a second volunteer developed inflammation of the spinal cord, known as transverse myelitis. Transverse myelitis, the threat of paralysis, damn, damn, damn. You find yourself in a cold sweat, before reassuring yourself that AstraZeneca based its vaccine on the chimpanzee adenovirus, while Russia’s uses the human adenovirus. It’s better understood, but what if it fails? What if it fails on you?
1:05 p.m.

&gt;Time to measure my temperature. 36.8 degrees Celsius [98.2 degrees Fahrenheit]. It’s normal. It was a placebo. I’m certain it was the placebo. Yes, I can feel it for sure now.

&gt;I change the channel in my head and start reading other news. “In Moscow, the number of new confirmed coronavirus cases nears 1,000.” Four days ago, it was 730 new cases. In a week, the number will be 2,217. My hands are shaking.

&gt;1:06 p.m.

&gt;Another temperature check. Now it’s 36.9 [98.4 degrees Fahrenheit]. Now we’re in business. Vaccine, vaccine, let it be the vaccine. I can feel that it’s the vaccine.

&gt;I spend the whole day repeating this routine. A runny nose becomes a headache, which leads to muscle soreness and pain down my spine. It’s nothing extreme, though, and I handle it with an acetaminophen pill. Is it the vaccine or was it a placebo? 

&gt;I know who could help me — a doctor. When they gave me the shot, they promised that a doctor would call every day or contact me through the Check Covid-19 app. I check my phone and the app constantly, but there’s nothing.

&gt;Then I get a push notification from the city’s coronavirus task force. It’s a news story about how officials at the World Health Organization marvel at Moscow’s telemedicine center:",Again what learned,/r/europe/comments/j2awjr/ending_the_nightmare_a_meduza_special/g75fj58/,Schnauze-Lutscher,1601448796

Poland indeed used the opportunity and took micro piece of land from Czechoslovakia, inhabited by Polish majority. This territory had been previously snached by Czechoslovakia from Poland in 1920, during Polish-Bolschevik War.  However Poland wasn't part of Munich agreement. Poland didn't make any arrangements with Germany. Poland didn't cooperate with Germany. Poland didn't care about agreements between UK, France and Germany. Poland simply took chance during the chaos to get that very small piece of land which had been stolen from it.

Despite having legitimate arguments behind its deeds, today Poland is not proud of this action. Poland apologized Czech Republic for it. Poland and Poles declared that was a mistake.

The US does not ask permission to travel the seas, it merely will notify nearby countries as a courtesy.  The US patrols the South China Sea, China does not patrol the Gulf of Mexico.

If you would like to learn more on the subject from a public source:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue-water_navy

and this data is a little outdated, but relevant:
https://www.businessinsider.com/magnitude-of-us-naval-dominance-2013-11#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20has%2019%20aircraft,world's%2012%20aircraft%20carriers%20combined.

And that's just carriers.  The Soviet Union was able to exert naval power during the cold war despite having a aircraft carrier disadvantage as well.  (Primarily though attack submarine and fast missile boats).  But they also had the key element: replenishment at sea capability.  The US is a superpower not just from the size and technological advancement, but also because it has invested in the support infrastructure necessary to project power anywhere it wants.  Noone comes close to matching the US in military supply chain capability.

China lacks this entirely.  Their recent naval buildup is entirely built with an eye on capturing Taiwan.  Which will happen in the next 20 years, btw, so remember I told you first.

5140,"**Female life expectancy highest in several regions across Spain and France**

In 2018, the 10 regions in the EU with the highest levels of female life expectancy at birth were all located in Spain or France. The Spanish capital region had the highest female life expectancy (88.1 years), while the top 10 regions were completed by six more Spanish regions and three French regions.

Some of the highest levels of male life expectancy at birth were recorded in northern and central Italy, with a peak of 82.7 years in Provincia Autonoma di Trento.

**On average, a person aged 65 years living in the Comunidad de Madrid could expect to live a further 23.2 years**

In 2018, an EU resident who had survived to the age of 65 could expect to live, on average, a further 20.0 years. The highest levels of life expectancy at this age were recorded in a band of regions running from northern Spain through much of western and southern France and into northern and central parts of Italy, as well as the north-western Greek region of Ipeiros.

A more detailed analysis of NUTS level 2 regions reveals that in 2018, a person at the age of 65 living in the Comunidad de Madrid could expect to live a further 23.2 years on average, while the corresponding figure for the Île de France was a further 23.0 years.

In contrast, life expectancy at 65 years was considerably lower in the vast majority of regions in eastern and Baltic Member States. The lowest levels of life expectancy at 65 years were recorded in two Bulgarian regions — where a 65 year-old person could expect to live, on average, a further 15.7 years.

Hey newsflash: ""softer propaganda"" is called differences in national viewpoints. You don't allow for that only Western approved viewpoints are legitimate, everything else is ""propaganda"" -- like when West puts money in other countries, it's ""investment"" but when China does it, it's ""buying up a country"". You're just not Russian so basically anything that Russia does that isn't bending over and taking it up the ass is ""Russian propaganda viewpoints"". West fucking loved Russia in the 90s when we got two apocalyptic depressions in 1991 and 1997, whilst we got looted by shock therapy, our collective state assets being sold off. I'm not gonna be a little bitch and say whatever you want my lips to say. 

At the same time, I have no place in Putin's Russia and I know it. Future has no place in Putin's Russia, he is hell-bent on a ultraconservative tsar Nicholas I style regression. Putin has turned our brothers, Ukrainians, into enemies and pushed them away irrevocably to the West. Putin is leaving Russia to rot in a kleptocracy to benefit his oligarch buddies. Russia's place is with the rest of Europe, not with dictatorial China or Turkey or his other band of merry tyrants and wanna be tyrants like Trump. 

Who the fuck do you think is paying me to say this?? Soros? Like, no Putinist would ever love Europe or say any of this. What soft propaganda did I push? Crimea? Yeah I couldn't resist slipping that in to judge your reaction. Almost nobody feels sorry about that and nor do Crimeans. And don't start crying about Tatars, they gained that land by being the biggest band of rapists and slavers in all of EE. They're not some poor aboriginals inhabiting the land since before history, they don't own Crimea and they are not large enough to stop self-determination, there were plenty of Serbs in Kosovo and that didn't stop it either. If you know politics you must know that Crimea was revenge for Kosovo. US would never stand for Russia intervening to split Quebec from Canada and then turning it into a pro Russia country. You don't just mess with allies of regional powers without blowback. Hell, US literally marked two continents as its personal playground, no other countries allowed.

In fact, the Crimean Tatars, who were vassals of the Turks for about 300 years, were interested in the Russians. The Russians and the Crimean Tatars were equal, and the Ottomans did not see the Russians as a power. In the 17th century, when the Ottoman Empire started to decline, the brilliant period of the Russians was beginning. In other words, the period when one country is the worst and the best of the other does not seem like a logical comparison. If we say this, we can say that Russia is a region that will be plundered for more than 900 (800-1700) years for the Turks. Even in the worst times of the Ottoman Empire, he fought many successful battles against the Russians. Again, Russians generally participated in the war with their alliances until the end of the 19th century (Austro-Hungarian, Balkan nations).",,/r/europe/comments/j1zyia/urgent_turkish_f16_shoots_down_armenia_jet_in/g74wm1k/,3WayToDie,1601434750

ETA: the sad fact is that if reunification ever happens, it will be on the basis that nationalists have gained a majority and voted for it, and unionists will have refused to take part in any conversation on the matter. Reunification, if it goes ahead, will have to go ahead without unionist input. And that’s why most parties in the Republic don’t want a border poll when there’s just a bare 50%+1, they want to wait until nationalists outnumber unionists far more. Because it’s a fact that there is no way for reunification to happen that will please unionists. It’s a contradiction in terms.

5349,"&gt;Not really sure what you're asking for, aside from fracturing a long term military alliance where a single country actually consists of a military able to engage with the existential threat to members of that alliance.

I don't know why you are not really given that I was pretty clear:

**I hope that Europeans will finally open their eyes: The NATO is intended to serve American's interest, not ours. Turkey is too essential for Washington to be exclude from it. The Greek-Turkey crisis perfectly demonstrated the lack of legal and defensive means when it comes to our own domestic security.**

We must think our security ourselves, outside NATO's framework.

&gt;What other NATO countries would you like to expel from the alliance because they don't have European interests at heart? All of the former soviet bloc nations? Would the military strength of NATO without the US backing it have any type of parity with the Russian military?

Your conception of Russia seems to be outdated. You are spitting out the transantlatic soup we have been served for decades.

Russia's crambling economy make it impossible for Moscow to engage into any large-scale conflict against Europe.

Ironically, given that Turkey is the home of 3.9 million refugees and controls some very strategic Libyan coasts, Ankara is de facto a larger threat to EU's security than Russia at the moment.

Even the Americans do not believe it anymore. The Russian card is used by Washington to justify increasing military expenses without having to target Beijing directly thus preventing any useless escalation.

I didn't ask to expel Turkey from the NATO: The fact that whether Turkey is a member or not would not matter if the NATO was not the first security framework in Europe. This is precisely why we must take responsability for our own security - so that we don't have to rely on the U.S. - who won't move if it goes against their own interests-  when our sovereignty is attacked, c.f the Greek-Turkish crisis.",,/r/europe/comments/j1zyia/urgent_turkish_f16_shoots_down_armenia_jet_in/g74ib7w/,Kobaltdr,1601427087

Civilians were beaten for asking armed masked invaders who they were. The parliament vote to hold the referendum in the first place was either done at gunpoint or by the gunmen themselves.

5382,"My understanding is that it has more to do with both money and the unstable nature of the region at the time.

As the Armenian Genocide was perpetrated by the Ottoman Empire, this allows both the modern day Turkish state and the Turkish public as a whole to somewhat wash their hands of the events of that time, at least from a ""guilt"" perspective. After all, present day Turkey was born out of a revolution which sought (in part) to end the Ottoman Empire and went on to thoroughly reject most Ottoman values. When the Armenian Genocide is brought up, Turks are able to honestly respond with ""Yeah, the guys that did that sucked, that's why we got rid of them"". That doesn't justify genocide denial, but it does make it rather more difficult to assign blame. The government which carried out the genocide was repudiated and overthrown by its people for entirely unrelated reasons, which can make it difficult to accept blame for the actions of the very same government which your people overthrew.

And then there's the money problem. This isn't right either, but it's also a real issue preventing the recognition of the Armenian Genocide by Turkey. As it turns out, when you genocide a people this causes a lot of damage, which the legal system can quantify in terms of money. For a genocide you're talking an enormous sum which is rightfully owed to the survivors and the heirs of the deceased. Turkey has never exactly been a beacon of financial stability, and especially in the aftermath of the Ottoman Empire's collapse they were in dire straits. If the Turkish government recognised the Armenian Genocide, even if they only said that it was the Ottomans which carried it out, the Turkish government could be held liable for reparations. Quite frankly, the money to pay these reparations isn't there. It wasn't there after the founding of Turkey, and it's not there now. Once you set aside values, ethics, etc the Turkish government would be insane to recognise the Armenian Genocide because doing so would entail an enormous financial strain that would likely bankrupt the government.

The Armenian Genocide happened. The present-day Turkish government should recognise it, even though it was carried out by the Ottomans. It's just that the combination of ""well it really wasn't even us that did it"" and ""holy shit recognising this would be fucking expensive"" makes it a lose-lose scenario for any Turkish politician seeking to do the right thing, and in a real politik sense it's in the best interests of the state to prevent the electorate from pushing for recognition because of the consequences doing so would bring.

The only way I can see it being recognised by the Turkish government, at least in the foreseeable future, would be as part of accession to the EU because the influx of EU development funds and the exchange rate peg to the euro would make paying the necessary reparations financially possible. Until then there is literally no benefit to the Turkish state in doing so.

5497,"So Armenians existing is all just a big Russian/Soviet century-long conspiracy apparently. Thanks array29

The UN resolutions are regarding the return and occupation of the **surrounding** territories, but not Nagorno Karabakh itself. As I said Nagorno Karabakh should govern itself, and the surrounding regions **should** be ceded and governed by Azerbaijan, in line with the OSCE process both Armenia and Azerbaijan have agreed to.

The Armenians of Nagorno Karabakh are not ""occupying"" Nagorno Karabakh. They live there, that is their home, and that is what they defend.

The desire for secession in part because of ethnic cleansing against Armenians across Azerbaijan before the war started (Baku, Sumgait, Kirovobad/Ganja, Operation Ring). Obviously Armenians don't want to be part of a country that is killing them.

However the dispute goes back much further. See for example the pettition to Khruschev in 1964 which has specific economic complaints.

&gt;The Armenian population of the Azerbaijani SSR has been subjected to chauvinistic polices creating extremely unfavorable conditions of life. At the inception of the autonomy, certain positive steps were undertaken for the development of industry and agriculture in the region. Subsequently, however, every enterprise has been thwarted, and established institutions have either been inhibited from functioning or have been transferred to regions inhabited by Azerbaijanis. On the other hand, demands were imposed upon our region which were exacting and beyond the limits of our capacity. They resulted in such desperate acts as our beings forced to extricate wool from our beds, bedcovers and pillows in order to meet the quotas imposed upon us.

There were also cultural issues. Schools didn't have Armenian textbooks, TV did not show Armenian, and there was an explicit effort to move Azerbaijani's and Turkic people in to the region (“By doing this, I tried to increase the number of Azeris and to reduce the number of Armenians.”-Heydar Aliyev). When Armenian football team played, it was not allowed to cheer. Leadership chosen by for the region were at times patsies

As it is currently it can not be trusted for Azerbaijan to humanely govern Armenian, and you could argue the inverse. So hence Nagorno Karabakh should govern itself, and the surrounding regions should be ceded and governed by Azerbaijan.",,/r/europe/comments/j26sjj/pm_pashinyan_only_two_countries_seek_to_resolve/g745ra8/,iok,1601419806

I hope this incident makes more people understand why Russia was so angry after that Su-24 shootdown. What Turkey does is absurd, they violate airspace all the time, meanwhile the Su-24 did it for 4 seconds on a little piece of land that juts out and breaks a straight border of Syria, a piece of land that I should add, was annexed by Turkey under questionable circumstances to start with. 

Violations of airspace happen a lot all over the world, but you don't just shoot down and get pilots beheaded, you scramble your jets and escort them out, then maybe give a diplomatic reply (sanctions, strongly worded letters, stoking proxies, etc).",Apparently Serbia according to /u/cLnYze19N,/r/europe/comments/j1zyia/urgent_turkish_f16_shoots_down_armenia_jet_in/g73pag6/,Aemilius_Paulus,1601411599

&gt; Stefan Czarniecki was a 17th-century hetman (military commander), famous for his role in driving the Swedish army out of Poland after an occupation that had left the country in ruins and is remembered by Poles as the Deluge. With the outbreak of a Dano-Swedish War, he continued his fight against Sweden in Denmark, from where he ""returned across the sea"" to fight the invaders alongside the king who was then at the Royal Castle in Poznań.


The Deluge was one of the factors that the PLC was later partitioned.

5558,"&gt;In what ways? Belarus is not that different from Poland and Poland is considered as an integral part of the West nowadays.

It's very different. Even historically, Poland was allways fighting Russia, while Belarus was an assimilated part of the Russian empire, and then the Soviet union.. even ideologically, despite their very religious views Poland is much closer to the west that Belarus is. 

&gt;Sure, ideologically, much of the older generation is rather approving of Soviet-style policies, but the younger generation prefers Western democracy, and they are the future of the country.

Not only older generation, the younger too, and yes, many prefer democracy ofcourse, which is what the protesting is about, their dictator stopped pretending to be ellected and straight up demonstrated for all to see that it wasn't a joke when he ""ironically"" reffered to himself as a dictator.

&gt;The more Russia is included in all these cases, the more they feel empowered. I don't think such hostile actions should be rewarded.

It's not empowerment or rewarding, it's a neccessity.

&gt;We heard exactly the same thing about Russia and Ukraine.

I don't know where you heard it, I didn't... infact i heard the opposite aside from economical ties. Ukraine never really got over the Holodomor thing and as a nation harboured quite a bit of resentment towards Russia which they see as the nation that inherrited responsibility for Stalinist era atrocities.

I kept hearing comparisment between Maidan and what Belarus is going trough... but the only similarity here is both are slavic and both are former Soviet states, but beyond that, the current situation really isn't comparable. 

&gt; but you are kinda implying that Putin's regime has some monopoly over all East Slavs.

Am I? Where did you feel I implied that?

&gt;Putin does not enjoy support even everywhere in Russia, and most definitely should not have any exclusive rights in other sovereign states.

That's true enough. Though this isn't just about Putin, it's bigger than that... Putin is the guy standing in the way of Belarussian democracy for his personal gain and the gain of his friends who rely on him to stay in powerfull cashgrabbing positions, But Russia will loose an ally over it, an ally that will stay gone long after Putin is dead. 

Belarussians don't feel tied to Putin.

5622,"Because Europeans do not have direct ambitions in the Near East or Middle East. The situation would have been different if Turkey was located in Eastern Europe, for example above Ukraine.

In this scenario, having a strong buffer zone could have been interesting indeed.

Well, we could even argue that Russia having more leverage in the Middle East would incentive Moscow to focus more over there instead of Europe.

&gt;Why do you think European leaders are always so hesitant about attacking Turkey?

Because Turkey is an essential partner when it comes to refugee crisis. There are currently around 3.9 millions refugees located in Turkey right now.

When Germany amongst other EU countries pushed for a more conciliatory approach towards Turkey, it's because Europeands need to maintain cordial relations with Ankara for their own internal security.

It has nothing to do with Russia properly.

&gt;Russia isn’t an actual threat to the US directly.

The U.S. is not a regional power but a global power :Russia doesn't need to threat the U.S. directly to make Washington willing to undermine Moscow as the Americans have direct interests in pretty much every place in the world.

The Americans want to keep control over the Middle East by building a state of balance between Iran, Russia and Turkey slightly in favour of Ankara and Israel to some extent.

Russia is neither a threat to the U.S. nor an eternal rival. The U.S. would actually support Russia in Central Asia as Moscow is a direct rival of China in the region. Russia could be a potential pivot in Central Asia, a rival in the Middle East and in the Arctic.

I'm saying that if NATO were truly aggressive we would be seeing that everywhere because NATO just has  opportunities and temptations to be aggressive that no one else has.   


&gt;I wouldn't call it primarily defensive. Fifty-fifty at best, if assigning such a figure makes sense.  

I'd rank it better but  I think we're kinda talking about different things. I think  we should make a distinction between what NATO members do and what NATO does. Aggression from NATO members is more like an extra-curricular activity that some countries do on their own time. You have the most aggressive members in the US, UK, France and then you have more peaceful ones like Germany or the ones in the North and East. But the most peaceful ones aren't obligated to participate even if they sometimes do.

Given the lack of a free press in Hungary and more and more so in Poland, those results are indeed questioned. You must have been under a rock if you never heared of that. 

&gt; There are 11 AfD politicians in the EU parliament. [Politicians of this party say that refugees and migrants should be shot or gassed](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/9/29/afd-sacks-official-who-reportedly-said-refugees-could-be-gassed).  Yet I haven't seen an international outcry because of their presence in  the parliament and the fact that they decide on other nation's  policies. Nor has Germany banned this party. 

The AFD is under watch of the Verfassungsschutz, banning parties in Germany is incredible difficult but it should tell you something that the guy who made these remarks got fired immidialty. Even the AFD knows everybody is just waiting for them to fuck up. 

That said, as a Pole the AFD should be right up your ally. Pissing on migrants and mistreating people appears to be good Polish policy these days.

5761,"&gt;Defending yourself... in the lands of another country? What

So Azerbaijan reserves the right to capture the entirety of Artsakh and depopulate the people living there? The people living there aren't a foreign entity occupying a piece of Azerbaijan. They are ethnic Armenians that have inhabited those areas for thousands of years before Azerbaijan became an after thought. They are a people that operated under autonomous rule outside the jurisdiction of the Azerbaijani SSR.

You probably don't understand the historical context as to why this is a problem. The USSR, under Lenin created the 14 republics that would go on to make the USSR. The USSR, in an attempt to lessen Russian dominance over the internal politics within the union created these republics. Within these republics, the USSR also created autonomous control zones. That's where Ngorno Karabahk came in. A state within a state. A compromise within two people. Where Armenians made up the majority. 

So when the USSR ceased to exist, many countries effectively broke out of Russia's yoke to form their own independent sovereign nations. However, not all nations within the USSR could do so, the special autonomous zones for example weren't able to form their own countries. Hence why wars broke out in Georgia, Armenia x Azerbaijan etc.

So
- Ngorno Karabahk, like Abkhazia and Ossetia reserve the right to self determination 

- Two decades of Aliev's rule has resulted in a policy of no compromise and peace between the Armenians and Azeris. 

- It wasn't long ago (June 2020 IIRC) that Aliev threatened to attack Armenia's nuclear reactor and threatening a nuclear holocaust 

- God protect the innocent people of Armenia and Azerbaijan but the aggressor here is Prime Water melon seller himself and cummie bear lapdog Aliev.",,/r/europe/comments/j1zyia/urgent_turkish_f16_shoots_down_armenia_jet_in/g72ttyk/,ButtMunchyy,1601397682

The year 1959 is shown as the starting date of the events that set the stage for the Cyprus Peace Operation. Turkey, Britain and Greece signed in 1959 by the London and Zurich agreements based on the equality of the Greek and Turkish peoples of these countries guarantee the Republic of Cyprus was established. Following the attacks carried out by Greek-owned armed groups as of 1963, the Turkish Cypriots were removed from the country's administration by pressure and persecution. The attacks and embargoes carried out by the Greeks who wanted to reach the goal of connecting the island to Greece increased gradually in 1963-1974.

About Syria, if Turkey doesn't do anything about the thinks happening in Syria, the groups will become powerfull, and they will be attack Turkey, and the other reason is, when the groups fighted, the bombs has fell into Turkish territory (Its obvious Turkey should do something about it) so Turkish goverment attacked terrorist groups and pushed them back (Turkey is not going to demand for right, its for protecting own fields and helping Syrian civillians who getting attacks.)

Public education in the country became free and primary education compulsory for both sexes. Medical care became available to the public at no cost, but providing housing for all was a task the RCC government was not able to complete. Under Gaddafi, per capita income in the country rose to more than US$11,000, the fifth highest in Africa.

5851,"&gt; The original lyrics were composed in the 16th century, when the Netherlands was part of the Holy Roman Empire, and the expression refers to the Germanic peoples of the empire (which included the Dutch people), not to Germany in the modern sense of the word.

It would be correct to translate as ""am I of Dutch blood"". In germanic languages they don't use germanic, they use somehting like Duits (nl) or Deutsch (not nl). Duits/Diets/Deutsch is the name of the people and means...the people. Dutch people would have refered to themselves as nederduits and mostly stopped referring to themselves as Duits before the 20th century. English retained Dutch for the Dutch.

we use ""du"" which is cognate to tu (fr),du (de), you (eng), and therefore also ""thou"" (old eng), but there is no reason whatsoever if you are translating into modern English to translate it into thou instead of you.
