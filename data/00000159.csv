9,"&gt; At first I was just in disbelief, then I started seeking some conspiracy, until I finally realised that it's all much simpler - they are just *stupid*.

Greenpeace dated back to the mid-Cold War.  Their first protests were against nuclear *weapons*.  I suspect that for many people, all nuclear things got kinda mentally-associated.

http://ecosense.me/2017/01/18/issues-20/

&gt;In his shaggy-haired hippie youth, Patrick Moore was one of the nuclear energy industry‚Äôs most dauntless opponents. Today, he‚Äôs taking calls from reporters around the world and trying to defend its reputation in the panicky wake of the crisis at Japan‚Äôs Fukushima nuclear plant.
&gt;
&gt;In the ‚Äô70s, as one of the founding members, and later president of Greenpeace, Mr. Moore‚Äôs fellow activists parachuted into Ontario‚Äôs Darlington nuclear plant to protest its construction; 37 years later, he‚Äôs infuriated with the organization for exploiting the Japanese nuclear crisis to scare Ontario‚Äôs government away from building more reactors there. Mr. Moore knows this mistaken thinking started with him. And he regrets it.
&gt;
&gt;‚ÄúWe made the mistake of lumping nuclear energy in with nuclear weapons,‚Äù says Mr. Moore. The group he helped build wasn‚Äôt originally just about being green, it was also about peace, after all. Greenpeace opposed the arms race, and was committed to ensuring that nothing like Hiroshima and Nagasaki could happen again.
&gt;
&gt;But Mr. Moore eventually realized nuclear energy was the wrong target. It was comparatively benign, environmentally, and arguably more conducive to peace than oil bought from detestable regimes.
&gt;
&gt;But his fellow Greenpeacers refused to agree with that, or other conclusions Mr. Moore began to draw that he says were based on reason rather than emotion. It‚Äôs why, eventually, he had to quit. And it‚Äôs why he‚Äôll be in Toronto Wednesday promoting, at a Fraser Institute dinner, his new book, Confessions of a Greenpeace Dropout: The Making of a Sensible Environmentalist, in which he celebrates all the things he‚Äôs proud to have accomplished with Greenpeace ‚Äî and publicly lament the many dangerous mistakes he believes the organization has made since he left.",üá∫üá∏ United States of America,/r/europe/comments/c3ulbt/right_now_thousands_of_climate_activists_from_all/eru2iqn/,vokegaf,1561260897

39,"Taormina is definitely a tourist town, but who can blame them? The location is fantastic, the views are to die for and there is big money with visitors. 

The best part of Taromina is the people who live there. Just talk to them, not as a tourist but as a person, and they will give you invaluable advice. You'll learn where to find real food, not shit for the tourists. They'll tell you about everything from the best walking paths to the best time to see particular sites. They even gave me fantastic suggestions for literature which captured the essence of living under the shadow of Mt. Etna.

Taormina is frequently used as just a point to tick off on a Sicilian itenerary - see the Greek theatre! - but the best way to experience it is leisurely. The people there begin to open up after they see you a few days in a row and will happily give you real advice on how to experience the area. They want you to enjoy the town and are very hospitable.

I hated tourist Taormina but loved the people and the town behind the tourist traps. The best way to experience Taormina is what the locals suggest, and not by ticking off the red dots on a tourist map. You can ""see"" Taormina in an afternoon, but to really experience it you need to put a bit more effort into it.

When it comes to Germany, coal miners are still a strong lobby for the local governments. Now depending on the size and the length of these protests the mining companies might go in red which makes the business unprofitable. Once there are fewer miners and fewer mining companies, there are fewer incentives to curate policies according to their interests. 

Every single action that hurts the fossil fuel industry helps stop global warming.

Nobody saying that carbon taxes, nuclear power and investments into renewables is not the way to go, in fact we must do these 3 steps ASAP and hard.

But global warming will not wait for the next election until a more responsible government takes over, and those people decided that they want to do everything in their power to combat climate change.

By attacking supply you're making the same exact mistake that drug war people are making - only they have infinitely greater resources. What we should be doing is investing in alternative generation and power-saving schemes, which will naturally finish off the coal mining industry due to lack of **demand** - the same reason that made it contract for many decades now. Blocking one, two, dozen, or even a hundred mines won't accomplish shit - there's plenty of coal available for redevelopment in Poland, Ukraine, Russia and many other places where eco-invaders won't be a problem.

In any case, while I do agree that we should try to move up to less polluting fuel as much as possible, I think that these type of things should be accomplished in... hmm... more regular fashion? 

Last I checked - France is not in a position to do much of an additional export and they've been remarkably slow in new NPP construction over the last decades, while gas plants, unsurprisingly, require, well... natural gas to operate. North Stream-2 is under construction, which is great, but it's currently supplying a big fat 0 m^(3) of gas per (choose your favourite time measure, second/month/year). The other pipelines are used up as is, partially for political reasons and idiotic pumping back and forth between Slovakia and Ukraine. So...

Look, I love the idea of getting rid of coal. I could even understand the absolute radical's way of thinking - the people that believe that it's better to return to natural agriculture than to turn the planet into a desert. I just *really* don't understand what this particular event is supposed to accomplish. As a sabotage - it's hitting the ""strongest"" link in power production - the fuel extraction. This is by far the easiest thing to replace in power generation chain (just buy fuel elsewhere). 

For actual example of effective ""desperate measures"" that would have an appropriate, actual effect (at least momentarily) on CO^(2) emission, an attack on a major coal power plant to force it to cease production would seem like a logical choice. Except that therein lies the problem - it would *actually* succeed in the goal - coal would cease being transformed into electrical energy, and people would face blackouts. This *might, conceivably* lead to retaliations and general backlash against protesters - so they won't do it. Thus - this type of thing. The only people hurt are the local employees and operators (some other operators will benefit, as will some transport company), which won't make for much bad press, while the ""greens"" in question get to act out their Ernesto Guevara fantasy (only fantasy - Che would not approve of cosmetic actions like this).

I really support efforts to combat climate change and am completely flabbergasted that there are still people out there building political capital on denying it and digging their heels in against any measures to stop the approaching disaster.

&gt;while I do agree that we should try to move up to less polluting fuel as much as possible, I think that these type of things should be accomplished in... hmm... more regular fashion? 

Totally. The thing is, the only way to accellerate these things is through political will. And like you said, if they start shutting the entire grid down, it may backfire, but blocking Hambacher Forst and this mine, they definetely have goodwill on their side and generate attention (as long as there are no direct consequences). Once more political will exists, it gives the government more inventives to work around all the NIMBYs and get wind moving. Is how I see the way these protests help.

While I agree that some things climate activists call for are solutions that seem good, but actually cause emissions in other places, I don't completely understand why this makes you dislike the Greens. 1. They, like the protests, are currently one of the most potent symbols of public perception of climate urgency. 2. They are more competent and have more desire for actual anti-climate change policy than the other major parties.

Yeah, there is a lot of different types of people and actions involved in the fight against climate change. And I just kind of feel like we need all of them.

With too many parties then it becomes much harder to make decisive reforms. Small parties become kingmakers and there‚Äôs way more horse trading.

166,"&gt;So, I'm pretty sure on the lignite thing, I heard this in a lignite power plant from an employee and Wikipedia agrees. Maybe they transport the electricity, but not the coal. Not that that matters.

Okay, I'm definitely not an expert in this particular field, so I can't really argue, and a quick search in a few languages has presented me with contradictory information. Perhaps I'm wrong and this will actually have an effect on power generation emissions, though the actual question of total emissions (due to the fact that long-distance transportation of alternative fuel like regular coal also creates greenhouse gasses) is at the very least not fully resolved. Maybe the organisers of this action have thought this all through, made the really complex calculations and cost/benefit analyses that confirm that this will actually be beneficial to the planet overall...

...maybe. But I doubt it. Because:

&gt;While I agree that some things climate activists call for are solutions that seem good, but actually cause emissions in other places, I don't completely understand why this makes you dislike the Greens. 

I naturally dislike everything that's form over substance. Maybe I'm just too boring for the Gen Z (though I'm actually a very exciting person overall, ask anyone :)) but I prefer actual solutions and the most direct possible ways towards achieving them. They have completely lost me when they have started protesting against nuclear power - our only currently available technology that's available 24/7, rain or shine, wind or calm, that can be built anywhere and not on 0.00(...)01% of landmass (like Hydro) and *completely eliminates* greenhouse gas emissions while having enough fuel available to power humanity for the next 200 years. At first I was just in disbelief, then I started seeking some conspiracy, until I finally realised that it's all much simpler - they are just *stupid*. And I don't want stupid people representing humanity against an issue that might turn out to be our biggest challenge to date.

Looking at your energy mix and your GDP, I just don't know what they're asking you guys.

Parliaments by are representative legislative bodies. EU parliament vote is required on almost all EU laws, so by that definition the parliament is a real parliament.

And parliament has the power to amend the initiatives, so while they cannot make the official initiatives, they have the power to rewrite the content of those initiatives.

And as the Parliament has the power to reject initiatives by the Commission, it by no means is a rubber stamp. For example ACTA never came into force in EU because Parliament voted against it. Commission has no power to force parliament to act as a rubber stamp.

Juncker is the current Commission president because Parliament made clear to European Council they will not vote for anyone else for the Commission president than Juncker, their own candidate for Commission presidency.

239,"&gt; t shows. Americans are uniquely uncritical about their own state and deluded about that every single stateship system must be perfect just because it's American and that the US political system is the best ever designed.

More echo chamber bullshit. [Americans are notably critical and suspicious of their government; less than 5% of them trust them to always act justly and righthly. By almost any objective measure, they are extremely critical of their government.](https://www.people-press.org/2019/04/11/public-trust-in-government-1958-2019/) The trope of general dissatisfaction with the gridlock in DC is literally a meme over here with both incumbent and newcomer politicians, which you'd know if you weren't busy bloviating about those stupid Americans. Your opinion isn't supported by the facts of the situation, only be your strange anti-American invective. 

&gt;Yes that's the point; the young are brainwashed from an early age to revering their state.

Just absolutely and embarrassingly wrong. Few if any people revere ""the state"" itself, as in the governing body of the country. The pledge is not about *the state*. It's to *the country*. There is an enormous difference there. The government itself is not the object of the pledge, the concept of an American nation/people that transcends the state is the object. It's no different than say, the Spanish showing respect to the history of the Spanish nation and people, or the Russians showing respect to the historical Russian nation.

It is emphatically *not* about the state / political system itself. That is an opinion so divorced from the reality of the situation that literally only some European insulated by the ocean could think it. 

&gt;maybe a culture of those that seem to in all earnesty believe that their country is ""the land of opportunity"" despite having some of the lowest social mobility of any developed nation?

&gt;A country of those that think they have a well designed justice system whilst in reality the false conviction rates are huge

What kind of propaganda bullshit have you been consuming to think that Americans think this? Less than 22% of Americans put more than ""some"" trust in the justice system lmfao. 

https://news.gallup.com/poll/1597/confidence-institutions.aspx

&gt;a culture of those that having complete devotion to the mechanics of the supreme court ""constitutional review"" whilst any idiot outsider can see that the ""constitution"" has nothing to do with the US supreme court nullifying laws and it's just their own political opinions and that each of those justices owes loyalty to a party in practice. 

Fucking lol if you think people love the Supreme Court (Just 37% have more than ""some"" confidence in it). 

Let me put this in very simple terms: You are embarrassingly wrong about the pledge of allegiance, you've mistaken anti-American depictions and caricatures in the media of your country for the reality of the situation here, and in general, you have absolutely no idea what you're talking about when it comes to American confidence and support of their government.

335,"&gt; Now again with other sources. We never talked about other sources, we just talked about one single source. &gt;&gt; You believing one source was the whole point of the debate &lt;&lt;. Now you come with 10 others sources which btw back the claim in a completely different way. 

Well no, those other sources aren't part of the argument, they are here simply because YOU questioned wether the relevant parts of the article came from dpa or Spiegel. That was YOUR questioning, and since you were wondering I gave you the answers.

And my whole point of the argument is that you will end up having to trust single sources in trivial situations (as in questions like: were many schools closed on Friday in Aachen) because you cannot actively quadruple-check everything in your life. The solution to that is to dismiss sources (e.g. Newspapers, Journals) who you have no reason to trust (i.e. be skeptical). The way you can find out if you should trust a source is by analyzing keeping in mind that you do cross-reference many things. That way you find out that you should probably be very skeptical of anything Bild prints, but can be more confident in what SZ or FAZ print. You will never be safe from any errors, but it is utterly impractical to cross-reference every minute detail. Just like neither you or I are looking up 5 different sources for the score of a football match, or the weather report. 

The problem with your argument¬†so far is that you claim skepticism, but show no way to ever go past skepticism. You can claim that you are part of some sort of ""both sides are wrong, enlightened centrism"", but that is only in so far as you claim that you want to be skeptic, but for the most part it's actually just not believing much. What would possibly satisfy you about the idea that many schools in Aachen were closed? There will be no peer-reviewed papers on this, and I can't believe that you would dismiss everything that doesn't live up to that standard.


&gt; Btw just for the record and from my scientific point of view: All those papers from the dpa feed are technically 1 source not 4. It's a mistake often made by first semesters to push their footnotes: quote 10 sources that seperately quote the same source.



Lmao and this is definitely the type of thing 2nd semester Students start saying about 1st semester students.

Of course that's just one source when it comes to the claim of ""multiple schools were closed"", but you were questioning that one couldn't know which part of the Spiegel article was dpa and which part could have possibly been by Spiegel who you've implied are apparently not as trustworthy. And in order to claim that the relevant parts are part of the dpa article, and not in fact Spiegel orginals, I gave you 4 sources.

I'd argue a lot of that is low hanging fruit. There is no question that renewables can supplement the grid. Turning the whole grid carbon neutral is a whole new ballgame.

It's hard to view that as a negative. If something is so solid you can take if for granted, that's a good thing.

&gt;simply because it's much cheaper to run cars on electricity.

That is true, but what is the up-front cost of an electric car. I don't know a lot of businesses that own electric cars instead of small engine European vans like the Renault Kangoo for example. My friend just bought a few for his daughters business, made it run on LNG, 0.03‚Ç¨ per km. It's pretty hard to beat that.

Also a small bit to add to that original comment is the issue will only get solved when both Poland and Israel unpoliticizes this historical event. Historical research and analysis should ideally be politically neutral and unbiased which is currently neither the case in both Poland and in Israel. Of course there is no such a thing as unbiased and completely neutral historian and we can't deny citizens the right to make opinion or point about history, but states can stop political and party interference in historical research and stop bending history to fit contemporary needs of a state. But I doubt that will happen any time soon as Israel and the event of Holocaust is unrepeatable, thus the event can't be unpoliticised, which in turn gives legitimacy to current, sometimes extreme stance of Poland.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/c3tg7a/holocaust_historians_divided_over_warsaw_ghetto/ert51vn/,ObdurateSloth,1561232645

524,"I did work in the sector, the prices are publicly available from various studies. Nuclear has the lowest average costs of electricity for operating facilities. As I said before, ignoring the capital costs it is the cheapest form of energy by far, but the capital costs are what makes nuclear expensive economically. [Here is a paper from 2016 from energy research institute](http://instituteforenergyresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IER_LCOE_2016-2.pdf), that I will cite. For new construction nuclear comes out at ~$90/MWh, combined cycle gas ~$55/MWh. An obvious difference in price and this study as nearly every other study forgot to take the decommisioning costs for various power plants, which for nuclear power plants are significant, and even today not a single nuclear power plant has been decommisioned completely, the furthest we got is to the ""temporary storage"" state. As a case study, my country is in the process of closing down it's nuclear power plant, and the costs are projected to be at the minimum 2.6 billion euros.

So overall it is not cheap, but maybe the costs are worth it? And if all goes well it is very safe. But there is no way around it, we will need more renewables and infrastructure needed for them in the future, so to me it seems it is better to just invest those billions of moneys there.

As for fuel storage, of course it is possible to do, no one is arguing that, but for things to go wrong all it takes is for one missfortune to happen in 500 years (in all actuality it is longer than that), and can anyone guarantee safety for anything for that long?

For example in Poland less than 50% was voting after 1989 when we regained independence. So politicians cared mostly about voters, who were mainly miners (our communist ""legacy"", we mined coal for Russia, in exchange they took our coal), so politicians were investing in coal industries to Keep their voters happy. And today we have problem, because our economy runs on coal. 

We should educate people that their vote has a meaning. The bright news is that in Poland recently (from 2018) we se growing attendance in elections, people are becoming more aware of their meaning, also coal industries are losing it's influence, old enstablisment is falling and new parties raise. European elections attendance  in Poland this year was higher compared to recent years (+40% vs 10 to 20% earlier).

I mean they still had an economy and could cultivate crops  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_peoples#Economy  However during the late years of the Roman empire there was a general cooling all over the hemisphere and some people argue it played a role in the fall of the empire but it's not confirmed.
This is the limes  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_peoples as you can see no mountains on the other side of it and  certainly no avalanches and trust me Italy had terrible floods. (The only area with mountains is Norway but they were much more widespread than that) Also swamps were extremely common in Italy too and during only fascism they were drained.

As for the rest of the answer unfortunately I don't know much about the history of modern Germany . However Germany wasn't conquered many times during history and they are the ones that instead did the conquering most of the time. The four rivers are positive for development: many civilizations developed around rivers. I don't think that being at the center of Europe is a disadvantage though.

631,"China wasn't unique in being beaten by the Mongols. The Mongols ravaged everyone in their path that didn't surrender. The Mongols used their main force to fight the Song and suffered heavy casualties doing so. They had a far easier time conquering central/western Asia and eastern Europe, using smaller armies and suffering only light losses.

The Manchus were able to take over China because the Ming dynasty at the time was weak and corrupt, they were crumbling. The Manchus on the other hand were at the height of their strength. The Ming was also being overwhelmed by rebellions all over the country. Nation states weren't a thing back then so the Manchus had the support of many Han governors/generals and their armies, which was vital in their conquest of China. This conquest took decades btw, it wasn't some easy feat.

The Europeans had overwhelming firepower (technology), no country on earth could resist them. China was never fully conquered or colonized by Europeans, they were just defeated and had to sign unequal treaties and open their country to trade. They got off easy compared to most of the world.

They couldn't easily calm down local revolts because these revolts could involve hundreds of thousands if not millions of rebels. Have some perspective.

The problem with your comment is that you're trying to give oversimplified explanations for very complex situations. Just because they lost some wars doesn't mean their armies were cannon fodder. The Romans lost a lot of battles too, doesn't mean they were cannon fodder either. The Romans were also overrun by ""barbarians"", and some [civil wars/revolts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Roman_civil_wars_and_revolts) lasted for years.

The reason Chinese generals often used many peasants is because it often worked. They could put 10k professional heavy infantry in front, 30k crossbowmen and siege weapons behind them, and 10k heavy cavalry at the sides, and the enemy army would get shredded from a distance.",The Netherlands,/r/europe/comments/c38ny2/the_roman_empire_and_the_han_empire_around_ad_1/ersldvh/,BertDeathStare,1561217450

773,"&gt; My argument is that leftist parties have forgotten too much about their core messages about income inequality and workers rights. That has driven people to other parties, in part extremist ones. Saying: get back to your core and adjust your message to the new situation is not ""pissing down"" on anyone.
&gt;No, the traditional left has moved towards the right on these issues. That has caused them to lose voters since you could as well vote for a right wing party, since the left wing one wouldn't do much for you anyway as a member of the working class.

I don't think that's the entire truth. In most countries you have a center left party that often gets into government, and a smaller leftist party with a stronger leftist profile. If that was everything that mattered, voters would simply have switched from center left to old-school left or extreme left. To some extent that is happening, but that doesn't explain the large gains of extreme right parties. Those parties get voters from the whole political spectrum anyway, not just from leftist parties.

&gt;Yes far right parties do come with a platform of more money for these things. 

Some of them do now, but that does not explain their appeal. For example, the Belgian VB got big electorial victories both with a rightwing and a leftwing economical programme. But at both times, their core identity was racism and to a lesser extent ethical conservatism. And the period in between while they were not getting votes, it was because other rightwing parties profiled themselves on being tough on immigration.

&gt;So what I would advise left wing parties, is maybe be a bit more strict in the immigration debate so it doesn't look like you want a lot of people to just move here - which is the view people have, no matter if it is 100% true or not. And actually stop moving to the right on economic issues and be there again for the working class.

While I obviously support staying true to the core leftist values, that's not the reason for loss of voters of the left as a whole - there has always been a stronger leftist alternative for center-left parties in government, but that did not prevent the growth of the extreme right.

What is needed on immigration and demographics is a numbers-based approach to complement the absolute rights-based approach. Receiving immigrants has costs and benefits, that change with the type of migrant. So we can determine our capacity for immigration. People will still disagree, but then it's a debate about numbers rather than absolutes, which will defuse a lot of the problems around it.

&gt;This black and white view of yours is not helping anything. 

How is judging people on their actions, a judgement that changes when those actions change, a black and white view?

&gt;your point was: because In Germany only 2 states have started the summer breaks, everything is invalid.

This was not my point. Don't try to straw man me.

But nevertheless I'd like to make it short: your reply is a perfect example for why we are stuck in the whole climate change debate: you prefer belivin' over knowin'. If you believe that narrow information without any sort of doubt then fine I mean it's your choice. But then you can't be mad if people like me say that you don't think critically. Also your example with the australian sky is utterly incomparable. We have pictures form the sky in australia, multiple sources telling us that the sky is blue and an actual scientific explanation for the color. You like to believe what you like I get it. There is a difference between be sceptical and assume everything is false. I advocate(d) the first, you implied the latter.

&gt;Again, you're having general problems with the way knowledge works.

But still I need to reject this. I mean you defend that ""source"" with such blind righteousness.. because it says so. I mean Jesus christ do you really believe everything that's just given to you like this? Ever heard of the gell-mann effect?

804,"Well, this map is wrong, because it is mixing **Thank you!** and **Thanks**, where most of the map is showing **Thanks translation - IT IS NOT THANK YOU in most of the languages on this map.**

&amp;#x200B;

**English Thank You** most probably has been influenced by Celtic, as it is exactly the same as **Tapadh Leat** **in Gaelic** which means exactly that: Thanks + (to) You, so **apart from these two(and probably some others which I'm not sure) this map is mostly showing only Thanks without You and that requires some clarifications**.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Both of **Russian and Latvian Thanks equivalents** are shortened versions of God helps! That might be very early orthodox christian impact - even before catholics arrived there and met pagans:

Russian: Spasi Bog!

Latvian: Palƒ´dz Dievs!

It was initially used as a greeting: Dies palƒ´dz! - Palƒ´dz Dies! was reply. There are similar greetings, where returned part sounded like thanking and was meant to return back. So it evolved as shortened version and was used for other occasions - not only as a returned greeting.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

And in that sense exact equivalent for **Thank You** in Latvian would mean **Pateicos Tev!** or **Tencinu!** as rarely anyone would say ""Paldies Tev!"", as **Paldies is already used as Thanks - not as Thank part.**

**TencinƒÅt** would even sound very similar to English **""Thank""** and this word is used when referring to ""thank you gift or gratitude"", where using ""Paldies dƒÅvana"" just doesn't work, as it has much narrower meaning, even if it is now used more often. I think, that the same is true for Russian version of Blagodaritj, where Bulgarians are using that more original wording as Thanks.

I would translate ""**Thank(someone)**"" to ""**Pateikties**"" in Latvian or **Blagodaritj** in Russian, as it would be illogical to create verb from ""Paldies"" and that applies to Spasibo(h/g) as well.

&gt; Germanic peole lived in South Scandinavia/North Germany which is cold but really flat 

That reminds of another thing. It was not just forest that had to be cleared for the northern plain in germany to be usable but numerous bogs and lakes as well. Because the area is so flat, there is no runoff and since there is much precipitation there as well it settles in and in winter it freezes over before being unfrozen in the spring and then more water is added since evaporation happens to slowly in such a cold region that it forms these unmanageable swamps and bogs that have to be cleared.

&gt;Italy is mountainous, has the alps/appennines, 


That is a good thing for them when it comes to development. The alps dealt Hannibal a decisive blow.

&gt;volcanoes, earthquakes (lots of them), floods, avalanches.

https://i.pinimg.com/originals/b4/31/5f/b4315f9a520d482283f896b8674f7c44.jpg

The po valley can certainly experience avalanches and floods but not on the same scale as germany. Also, italy does not have very harsh winters like germany that shorten food stock and development of cities leading to less population and economic growth. 

 Germany is weird in that it has many things going for it but it can't put most things to use until tools and machinery from the industrial period make it easier to build up defense and unify the country. Take for instance. that it's northern plain is great for development once you clear everything over hundreds of year but then since the area is so flat and the northern european plain extends from poland to france, there is no land barrier to stop people from those areas from harassing the people of northern germany. Then you have the sea raiding baltic states that harass any meager ships you put out. In relation to it's borders and the enemies on those borders Germany has to be in one of the most difficult strategic positions out there. Then you have the four rivers but only two of them connect and all four lead to different areas and seas making it fate that the resulting settlements that form from there will have different economic goals making unity a far away prospect. This made it so Germans lacked independent access to the ocean and it was not until 1720 that Germany finally had solid control over one of it's river delta cities that it took from the swedish empire.

&gt; It is true though that being in the Mediterranean played a great role to development.

No one can 100 percent know for sure why certain areas did not develop as fast as others. It could be as simple as Roman ingenuity that they went as far as they did. I won't make less of what they did. Many civilizations had good geographies and positions to develop from ancient china, india, iran, and ancient indus river civilizations but Rome during it's time had better education, prosperity, engineering and more advanced infrastructure such as miles of paved roads, bridges, sewers, and aqueducts while all others had none of those things. While we don't know all about Romans, we do know that they were special in many ways.

&gt;The French foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, said Wednesday that there were 450 French citizens affiliated with the Islamic State being held in camps in northeastern Syria. But with memories still fresh of the terrorist attacks in Paris in 2015, in Nice in 2016 and Tr√®bes in 2018, polls show that a vast majority of French people do not want these citizens returned, even if they were to be detained and tried.

&gt;One problem, said Jean-Charles Brisard, the head of the Center for the Analysis of Terrorism in Paris, is that sometimes ‚Äúthere‚Äôs not enough proof‚Äù to convict them in French courts.

The argument is whether illegal immigrants, illegal asylum seekers, and unaccompanied minors have committed a crime, therefore are interred with or without committing a crime.

Others will point out that 100k people are coming a month. The system is totally overwhelmed, and without a systematic system to house and protect and separate those legitimate refugees and asylum seekers, the US would be willingly committing to creating a humanitarian crisis.

911,"&gt;Second, the recent Australian analysis of potential storage sites - based on those geographical features of yours - claims massively higher potential for Western Europe than 2.6 TWh. Just for Western Europe, total potential capacity is indicated as 78 TWh - in this analysis, Western Europe is mostly Germany and France, geographically. If you add Northern Europe, which includes the UK and Nordic countries, you're at 128 TWh of predicted potential. There's additional potential in the rest of Central Europe - Germany is in the western dataset here - and Eastern Europe for storage for the ENTSO-E grid but since the region in the study includes the whole of Russia, you'd have to filter out most of it geographically and I haven't gotten around to doing that. Southern Europe has additional 387 TWh of potential indicated.

The ESTORAGE system that Europe is building claims 2.6 and of which 1.3 would be in Norways. So it doesn't only include France and Germany.

&gt;. I mean, for Germany, 2.6 TWh is is day and a half of running 100% off of storage, which is unlikely in the overwhelming majority of cases since there is significant solar generation for 3/4 of the year with wind being even more likely available in the remaining 1/4 of the year, as I've already noted elsewhere in the thread. Which means that even 2.6 TWh brings you very far.

The efficiency changes. 

&gt;While the installed wind power production capacity was 35.92 GW, average production was 5.85 GW, just 16.3% of capacity, and secured production which was available in 99.5% of the hours, was 0.13 GW, or 4 per mille of capacity. At 37.34 GW, the installed solar capacity was nearly the same as in the case of wind power. However, the average production was only 3.7 GW, which is 9.9% of capacity, and, of course, secured production was zero

For Germany to generate enough for itself for 2.6 (Which nobody else in europe can use, the entire system) they would need a system that has the installed capacity 7 times more than the consumption to require that they don't dip in the storage too often. Installed capacity capable of generating 3300 TW. Which is bullshit.

Of course you can keep believing in fairytales and cry everytime Germany misses it's goals and blame it on politics.",üáÆüá± –ò–∑—Ä–∞–µ–ª üáÆüá±,/r/europe/comments/c3an10/a_100_renewable_grid_isnt_just_feasible_its_in/ers24ng/,ahwhatever11,1561195575

932,"&gt;This only deals with the growth of renewable shares. It does not deal with storing energy for months where the solar and wind generation are at a minimum.

&gt;What ""months""? There is clearly not even a month-long period where there's no generation at all to bridge over.

&gt;While the installed wind power production capacity was 35.92 GW, average production was 5.85 GW, just 16.3% of capacity, and secured production which was available in 99.5% of the hours, was 0.13 GW, or 4 per mille of capacity. At 37.34 GW, the installed solar capacity was nearly the same as in the case of wind power. However, the average production was only 3.7 GW, which is 9.9% of capacity, and, of course, secured production was zero

Months where the generation is less than 10% of the installed capacity. It's never 0 and it doesn't have to be. But if you have enough wind and solar to power germany but your plants are operating at 10% capacity, you're 90% short. Meaning you'd have to have 7x-10x times more capacity which is NOT REASONABLE.

&gt;That is nonsensical math. That's not how any of this works. You're not even taking into account the shape of the generation curve which is of massive importance for the required capacity at any required level of penetration.

&gt;Furthermore, combined German wind capacity factor was around 22% in 2018, not 16%. Not only that but you can also expect it to grow in line with new, better types of turbines, and the increasing offshore/onshore ratio of German wind installations (11% last year, 8% three years before that, only 2% two years before that). German offshore capacity factor averages around 40%.

No, that's simple math. I try to make it so anyone can understand. 

&gt;Current reserves of cobalt are sufficient for manufacturing around 1.6 billion Tesla Model 3s. That is way more than even the current car fleet of the entire world (about a billion), and assumes no further technological progress in battery technology, just furthering the status quo. And also assumes all the vehicles will have large batteries, compared to BMW i3 style light vehicles which might require a ""half-sized"" battery (and perhaps could use some occasional range extension by an onboard generator, like some i3 models).

Thank God only Teslas use batteries. Oh wait, literally everything else does too. And if you want to build them for storing electrical energy too, guess how many Teslas that number falls down too ? 0!",üáÆüá± –ò–∑—Ä–∞–µ–ª üáÆüá±,/r/europe/comments/c3an10/a_100_renewable_grid_isnt_just_feasible_its_in/ers2arh/,ahwhatever11,1561195853

963,"&gt;People like me see AOC use terms like ‚ÄúDachau‚Äù and ‚Äúnever again‚Äù, and immediately associate her implication that the border camps are analogous to Nazi camps. Which is 100% absurd, and intellectually dishonest and an insult to the victims of nazi crimes.

Stop pretending you're speaking for the victims of the concentration camps. These people are still alive and in agreement with what AOC said. They also find denialists such as you to be the most insulting, and not AOC. 

[‚ÄòI Know What Concentration Camps Are,‚Äô Actor George Takei Says]( https://www.huffpost.com/entry/george-takei-concentration-camps_n_5d0be29fe4b0aa375f49b69f)

&gt;In response, the ‚ÄúStar Trek‚Äù actor tweeted about his own experience with such conditions. Takei, who was incarcerated as a child at Rohwer War Relocation Center and Tule Lake War Relocation Center for being Japanese American during World War II, wrote that he knows ‚Äúwhat concentration camps are.‚Äù 

&gt;**‚ÄúI was inside two of them, in America,‚Äù he tweeted. ‚ÄúAnd yes, we are operating such camps again.‚Äù** 

&gt;Nina Wallace, a communications coordinator for Densho, an organization that works to preserve Japanese American history, supported Takei‚Äôs comments. She told HuffPost that, although many continue to refer to the facilities where Japanese Americans were incarcerated as ‚Äúinternment camps‚Äù or ‚Äúrelocation centers,‚Äù these terms are euphemisms. The Trump administration has used terms such as ‚Äúfederal migrant shelters‚Äù and ‚Äútemporary shelters for unaccompanied minors.‚Äù 

&gt;**‚ÄúA concentration camp is a place where civilians are confined for military or political purposes based on their identity. As prison camps outside the criminal justice system, designed to detain Japanese Americans based solely on their racial and ethnic identity, sites like Manzanar and Tule Lake were absolutely U.S. concentration camps,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThese were compounds of barracks surrounded by barbed wire fences and patrolled by armed guards, which Japanese Americans could not leave without permission.‚Äù**

&gt;By failing to describe the facilities that Ocasio-Cortez had referenced as concentration camps, Wallace said, the administration is using euphemisms as a ‚Äúdeliberate tool to obscure harsh realities and prevent us from recognizing historical patterns.‚Äù

&gt;‚ÄúTo avoid repeating the mistakes of our past, we must be able to see them clearly ‚Äï and that means calling Trump‚Äôs concentration camps for migrant children and families exactly what they are.‚Äù

&gt;**Concentration camp expert Andrea Pitzer, whom Ocasio-Cortez referenced in her tweet as confirmation for her honest language in labeling the detention centers along the U.S.-Mexico border,  doubled down on her use of the term Tuesday.** 

&gt;**‚ÄúIf we want to call it ‚Äòirregular detention,‚Äô if we want to call it ‚Äòextrajudicial detention,‚Äô I don‚Äôt think we have to get stuck on that term,‚Äù Pitzer said. ‚ÄúI wrote a history of the term ... and what I would really like people to know is that the same thing is happening here now.‚Äù**",European Union,/r/europe/comments/c39q1t/letter_from_a_polish_mp_to_ocasio_cortez/ers2kok/,Canal_Volphied,1561196318

As far es climate neutral fuel goes I'm a fan of the Desertec 2.0 idea, where fuel like Methanol can be synthesized purely with solar power in Africa. This would theoretically allow us to keep our entire liquid fuel based infrastructure, just replacing said fuel with something climate-neutrale (since basically an equal amount of CO2 is being used for the production of synthesized fuel as when it's being burned).

&gt; China also has a clear lead in terms of the underlying technology, with well over 150,000 renewable energy patents as of 2016, 29% of the global total. The next closest country is the U.S., which had a little over 100,000 patents, with Japan and the E.U. having closer to 75,000 patents each.

1115,"&gt;Thats why 90% do not appear to their court dates.    

Source?   
  
I've heard differently:   

&gt; So what do the court attendance rates of asylees look like? While the data is scarce, they show higher rates, compared to when all migrants are tallied together.
&gt; 
&gt; One source of data comes from an Obama-era program that released asylees from detention and matched them with case managers who encouraged compliance with court-ordered obligations. As of April, the Family Case Management Program, or FCMP, had 630 enrolled families.
&gt; 
&gt; Before the Trump administration ended the program in June, participants had a **100 percent attendance record** at court hearings. They also had a **99 percent rate of check-ins** and appointments with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, according to a Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General report.
&gt; 
&gt; ""According to ICE, overall program compliance for all five regions is an average of 99 percent for ICE check-ins and appointments, as well as 100 percent attendance at court hearings,"" the report said. ""Since the inception of FCMP, 23 out of 954 participants (2 percent) were reported as absconders.""
&gt; 
&gt; In 2015, the immigration advocacy group American Immigration Council published a report that looked at studies from over the previous two decades that examined how well asylum seekers fulfilled their legal obligations. It found studies showed ""very high rates of compliance with proceedings by asylum seekers who were placed into alternatives to detention.""
&gt; 
&gt; The report cited a 2000 U.S. government-commissioned study that found an ""83 percent rate of compliance with court proceedings among asylum seekers who were found to have a credible fear in the expedited removal process."" **It also showed an 84 percent compliance rate among asylees under minimal supervision, and 78 percent among those who were unsupervised**.
&gt; 
&gt; A 2013 study sponsored by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees that looked at asylees in Toronto and Geneva noted a ""cooperative predisposition"" among asylum seekers. While the study did not look specifically at U.S.-bound asylees, it cited characteristics common among asylees, including an ""inclination towards law-abidingness,"" perhaps in relation to having fled home counties lacking in rule of law. It also noted asylum-seekers ""lack of a plan B"" due to the ""impossibility of returning home.""

Not to forget the inherent problem of the Bahn, that others mentioned: The railway-network is too old and too small and the railways for goods are the same as for personal transport. And those railways run through cities instead of around them, like in other countries. It was a different concept, when it started.

Funnily enough, when the Bahn tries to modernize it, mostly it's the Greens and conservatives on a local level that block new tracks, because of nature or valuable building-land being lost. Those are the same people, that then complain about car- and lorrytraffic near their houses.

1207,"&gt; Actually... when the US constitution was adopted in 1787 that‚Äôs exactly what the framers envisioned. 

That's a fair point. But as I recall it, the Framers didn't really envision the office of president to be all that powerful in the first place - that's why they vested almost all the power in Congress. And let's not even go into the 'imperial presidency' the US has today. 

Besides, I don't really hold it against them that they didn't come up with solutions for the 21^st century back in the 18^th century. They did a pretty good job in the world they lived in.

&gt; It would probably really promote English as well since everyone would need to speak English to give campaign rallies in foreign countries.

That's a nice side effect. Native English speakers, particularly in North America, are always tempted to assume that the rest of the world is just like them while it really isn't. You can travel from DC to Portland whilst never switching languages. If you travel the same distance in Europe, you'd encounter 8 quite different languages. Which is a problem as long as there isn't a *real* second working language for everyone, and there never will be one unless people need to adopt one.

1246,"&gt; Well, the reason people don't care is because the people who are gonna die aren't really anyone special.

That's not true. If there is less food around, some people will not being fed properly. This leads to an increased amount of sickness. People who are sick can't work, and they spread disease.

Now, who is special enough to be fed properly? Doctors?! Some of them maybe, but would your general practitioner enter that category? If you have less doctor and less worker, you'll have less stuff done and the whole infrastructure will be at risk. Which means the foundation of our whole society, the people, will be at risk.

It won't translate in a lack of food, not directly. It'll start with an increase of prices because the cost of growing crops and keeping livestock alive will go up. For the livestock it'll be due to the cost of hay during winter, needed to be imported because the grass couldn't be grown sufficiently on a local scale that specific year. And since climate change is a global thing, the same kind of cost will be share by everybody.

The richest countries will be able to survive several years by importing food. But then what? It's not a solution.

1317,"&gt; So that will make the entire system even less efficient?

Not necessarily; you can alternatively - instead of discarding it - use it for purposes that are not strictly grid-related, such as electric vehicle charging (energy gets expended for driving) or ammonia production (serves as a chemical product). You kill three birds with one stone by making the generation capacity bigger:

1) The remaining ""non-clipped"" parts of the day will have increased share of solar power, achieved by having simply more generator capacity.

2) Electric vehicles will have enough clean electricity for charging when the generation exceeds the ""basic"" grid needs.

3) The chemical industry will be able to ditch methane as a CO2-intensive source of hydrogen for ammonia production. This could even be co-located with large solar arrays to avoid DC/AC/DC conversion and make the process more energy-efficient and more importantly more economical (you don't need extra inverter capacity for this application, only extra panel area).

Also, a reasonable assumption is that solar power in two decades will decrease in price considerably. Right now you're around 50 Euros/MWh for solar [*even in Germany*.](https://www.pv-magazine.com/2018/10/19/germanys-auction-for-large-scale-solar-concludes-with-average-price-of-e0-0469-kwh/) The long-term learning curve of solar is over 20% - at module level, [it's even 28.5%](https://twitter.com/Sustainable2050/status/1009505685929852929) (of price decrease per doubling of installed capacity). Also, [solar has been recently growing at 30% per year in cumulative capacity on average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_of_photovoltaics). This means that in just ten years, price of solar electricity even in Germany could be around 20 Euros/MWh. This in turn means that even if you wasted half of it (which in the above scenario you don't), the non-wasted half would still cost you 40 Euros/MWh, which is still cheaper than natural-gas-generated or even coal-generated electricity (not to mention new nuclear power which is outrageously expensive in comparison, perhaps around 100 Euros/MWh on average, depending on where in Europe you're building it).

&gt; That might actually be true if you consider the environmental costs of building batteries, switching out the entire infrastructure to cater to electric and recycling of used batteries (no one knows how to solve that one in a cost-effective manner).

The battery is maybe 15% of the mass of the contemporary car. What happens with the five times heavier car today? In any case, there's lots of push for recycling the batteries, even just to extract the cobalt from the batteries that contain it, for example. [There is definitely progress being done.](https://www.pv-magazine.com/2019/03/25/innovation-boosts-lithium-ion-battery-recycling-rate-to-over-80/) Combine this with the potentially rising prices of materials and it's going to get cost-effective relative to mining.",Czech Republic,/r/europe/comments/c3an10/a_100_renewable_grid_isnt_just_feasible_its_in/errdemp/,ObnoxiousFactczecher,1561167236

Imagine there was a asteroid falling towards earth, and we determine it to be way too big to blow up or push out of the path, but we could start sending missions which can begin eroding it slowly. We would need around 40 years to do it, but it's doable slow and steady.

1398,"Well, he's actually right. Your advices are absolutely right. What you don't understand matinthebox from Berlin (Germany) is that they work only in economics clean of politics and crime. Why there are so much foreign workers in Russia? From Georgia too, though mostly from other countries. Really much, you can travel through Moscow whole day and not hear Russian language once. Because there's not enough Russians to do everything? No-no-no, there is harsh unemployment. There are cities mutilated by socialist economics where people are destined to work like slaves because it's the only enterprise in their place and no other work at all. People don't need workers. People need work.  


So why there is so much workers? You see, for example, there is a position of a street cleaner. Each town needs a lot of them. Government gives some money on it, several years ago it was about $150-200 for a yard per month, average cleaner able to serve four-five yards. That's serious money even in Moscow. Now the one who hires people for work takes money and finds a worker who agrees to do it for $30, taking difference into their pocket. This is under survival level and of course nobody would agree to it except workers from the countries where even that is huge sum. Because of this corruption  there are workers and your good-hearted advice can *go fuck itself*. It's as useless as curing head with headache pills while the reason of pain is brain cancer.  


It's impossible to open a small distillery in Russia to let's say produce Russian traditional drinks (which is not vodka, obviously, vodka is rectificate that can be only produced with at least XIX century technologies, how it can be traditional? There is a rich tradition of wheat and rye distillates in Russia that was destroyed by Soviet regime by reasons I will not explain as it's offtopic). One man who tried counted it recently. The right to produce and sell alcohol costs $250,000 per year, the government first takes this money and then decides if they give this right. It's before taxes which are of course extremely high for alcohol. Now should I explain what each man who wants to work in the field do when there are no restrictions to import alcohol from countries like Georgia? And all shelves are stuffed with Georgian wine, yes, and your good advice... See above. It's nothing about economics and everything about politics and they still dare to whine at us while their economics is runt on our government squeezing money of us for their benefit.

1462,"This only deals with the growth of renewable shares. It does not deal with storing energy for months where the solar and wind generation are at a minimum.

In short they argue he overestimates the need of stored electricity for use in day-to-day operations of renewable networks. Which is fine, he might have or might not have. 

But you can't and this study does not argue the capacity of german electricity needing to be stored by those months when solar and wind are at their minimum, which is a far greater problem.

This is the main problem

&gt;While the installed wind power production capacity was 35.92 GW, average production was 5.85 GW, just 16.3% of capacity, and secured production which was available in 99.5% of the hours, was 0.13 GW, or 4 per mille of capacity. At 37.34 GW, the installed solar capacity was nearly the same as in the case of wind power. 

You might have the installed capacity in Germany of say 250 GW of solar and wind. Enough to power a decent sized city. But, during the month of December, when the wind doesn't blow and the sun doesn't shine (not as effectively , both happen), you might end up generation 25 GW per hour in total. Where is the rest coming from ? If you have 0.2 TW of storage as Germany does, it might account for a day at that consumption. But what about the rest of december ? What about January ? February ? Gonna use up all the electricity stored in Europe ?  What's the rest of Europe gonna use ?

&gt;The most ridiculous of which is to assume that we need to store the generation peak at noon, instead of simply discarding the excess energy.

What a silly statement. You can discard it of course, and it won't interfere with day to day operation probably, but as I said, what about those months in which you NEVER generate excess energy , and in fact not even enough to cover consumption ? Where will energy for that come from ? 

&gt;He is famous for spreading disinformation about climate change. More recently he was in the news by claiming that diesels are better for the environment than electric vehicles.

And there is some proof for that. Batteries are incredibly harmful to the enviroment. They might not produce CO2, but the extraction processes are a bitch and usually not counted since you know, they're in China!

And more importantly... without a new type of battery we're fucked. Li-on batteries mostly use cobalt in their structure. Current known reserve of cobalt are estimated to last 50 years with our current consumption. Consumption which will rise if you switch everyone to electric.

And as i said if you do that, our electric consumption also rises, thus generating the need for even more storage. And by their very nature, in cold weather batteries lose 30-40% of their capacity. Meaning they will have to recharge more and if you even though about using batteries for storing grid power, you'd either lose 30% of the capacity or have to heat them requiring more power. There's no way around it.",üáÆüá± –ò–∑—Ä–∞–µ–ª üáÆüá±,/r/europe/comments/c3an10/a_100_renewable_grid_isnt_just_feasible_its_in/err53xx/,ahwhatever11,1561160523

I want to ad that the infrastructure is not only bad but also insufficient. In entire Schleswig-Holstein there are no highspeed tracks, which causes that long-distance trains (ICE etc.) can not reach their usual travel-speed.

Another problem is that long-distance and freight trains have priority over regional trains. So if a long-distance train is coming from behind, the regional train has to stop, the regional trains on the track for the opposite direction stop too, the long-distance train passes via the track for the opposite direction and everyone has to wait for a safe distance before continuing.

I'll just clarify that I am neither a Communist, nor an Anarchist. I'm merely stating that our current, profit driven, capitalist system is insufficent in dealing with our inevitable extinction due to climate change. If we want to prevent this in a sufficent manner, we have to rethink how everything in our society functions.

Which I don't think is possible I might add, I don't think this is what's going to happen, or that it will ever happen. But it is the only thing which will have lasting impact realistically.

&gt;What we can do is a slow transition to more environmentally friendly materials

This would be a great solution...50 years ago. However that ship has sailed. We simply don't have the technological capacity, knowledge or time to do any kind of gradual, slow transition.

We have until 2050 to prevent **irreversible** changes to our climate that will affect our way of life, that's 30 years. We have until 2100 to prevent catastrophic destruction of several regions' ecosystem and way of life.

I wish I could hold your viewpoint, I truly do, I even did at one point. However we're simply at a point where it is near impossible to undo our fuck-ups incrementally. I don't put my faith in the hope that some vague, uninvented technology will be discovered that will save us all.

enough with that. Now about the part where we 'got what we deserved'.

Firstly you are uneducated about the subject if you think Russia cared to make a peace.
Russia tried to separate Georgoa into many peaces so that here would never be peace, because economic grows of this region would hit Russia hard. Georgia could be a hub between asia and eu but Russia is doing everything to not let that happen.

Russia follows Dugin's rulebook which says that Georgia should not exist independent of Russia, you can read more about that by yourself if yoy care. I don't think you do though.

They tried their best to separate those regions out of Georgia to keep us away from Nato, if you have unresolved borders you can't join Nato.

During the Rose Revolution Russia tried to break away adjara as well, which failed miserably. Adjarians themselves didn't think about braking away, it was Russia and their man Aslan Abashidze who were leading in there. It was in Russias interest to break away Ossetia and Abkhazia as well and they did everything they could to achieve that. You don't even know what was happening before 2008 and what lead to the war.

1612,"&gt;In fact the situation is so bad in sweden that even people with high education have no other choice but to op in for public housing. 

Maybe stop associating public housing with something bad? Why you don't want to understand that public housing doesn't have to be the last resort option? Why you don't want to understand that it's just a system they chose? That's why Sweden is so different from Spain, you have different mentalities and you will never understand their way of thinking. Their egalitarianism, law of Jante etc. also seem like rather stupid concepts to a Spaniard I believe. Pretty much all major Swedish parties support that system and it hasn't been changed since the 1960s when it was introduced so there must be something in it.

&gt;If you are forced to queue 10 years for a rental then doesn't matter you have no real choice.

No, you don't have to. You can rent a flat privately, you can buy a flat, take mortgage etc., everything like in Spain. Is it expensive? Sure it is, especially for an immigrant, but that's the price you pay for having well-paid jobs and attracting people from all over the world. Still, a Swede who makes decent money can afford to pay higher rent than a Spaniard, who has lower housing prices but doesn't have job at all or poorly paid one. 

&gt;In Spain most people don't need that option because we have plenty of other options.

Like what?

&gt; If Spain had better job market then I would never live in sweden

Then you know why apartments in Spain are so cheap. If Spain had as good job opportunities as Swedes has, your housing prices would skyrocket. Things like that are connected. 

Anyway, Poles say the same - ""if we had the same salaries like the British, no one would move to the UK from Poland"".

At first sight, yes. But if you go through Chinese history numbers of that size comes up again and again. It a matter of different geography and different societies. Europe's geography makes it difficult to feed a large army and to keep cohesion when marching; think thick forrests and narrow mountain pathways and only a few spread out farms to forage from. China on the other hand had vast plains with plenty of space to maneuver and with a far higher density of farms that could feed the army and a population that could be conscripted

Chinese armies consisted mostly of conscripts and it is reflected in the weaponry: Simple-to-use weapons like spears and bows; often mass-produced beforehand.

1622,"&gt; Logic is not objective -- it is a process. 

Logic is not a process. Logic is a concept, in our case informal logic. Reasoning is a progress, so is logical reasoning.

&gt; \[...\]  Logic is subject to people's point of view and rationale for their  decision making - thus, there can be bad ways to arrive at conclusions  \[...\]

Logic delivers methodological standards. If we agree on those methodological standards and use them the results are as objective as it gets. Just like we can agree that 1+1=2 despite our subjective perception of the world. The interpretation of those standards as well as their usage can be flawed. The former one deriving from false premises, the latter one leading to logical fallacies.

Not necessarily, probably the majority of arguments and decision making do not follow informal logic. Rationality seems to be far more common.

1767,"The actual gamble was using these miners. They were literal riot squads brout from Valea Jiului to Bucharest to do ONE job. And they were very proficient at it. 

They saw that, if they stick together, they get business as usual. Remember the alcohol? The PNTCD party was shattered in the elections because the mines were closed. Everybody thought that if a real shock squad like the mines from there can be dismantled, everything is on the table. Schools, hospitals, police, you name it, hence nobody voted PNTCD ever again. And back to communism, pardon socialist ideas. 

Then Basescu arrived and he fucked every political party, he is a player, he doesn't give a fuck. What do I mean by this he sayed anything and evreything under the sun and did precisely nothing, and, when he left office, as a final fuck you to PSD, SDP in English, he placed Laura Codruta Koveshi in antifraud office as top boss. She, I still believe, is incorruptible. 

Now, back to the miners, it is important to understand the political airplane view so the miners tragedy is not misunderstood. It's difficult for anyone to relearn something, to kick bad habits, and to spend your life in mines that will eventually kill you. Since the shock was so brutal, people went cucu, quite literally, and those that could, left, but most did not. And, at the time of mines closure, Romania was closed borders with the EU. Exiting Romania to work abroad could only be done illegally, well shit. A ton of people did leave, but most couldn't. Going from Romania to Germany, or the US, or Canada, or Japan, had the exact same chance of success, slim at best. Still we pressed on, but the miners? They scattered, found menial jobs that were heavily underpaid, and, in comparison, cannot sustain alcohol consumption and other shit. 

In short they wait to die. 

What outcome do you want is the real answer. Romanian hell, Germany's retrain the miners, get them other jobs, finance schools for this exact purpose, etc.

1778,"Already been studies and many scientists have warned of the effects of 5G with even the World Health Organisation calling the frequencies in which 5G uses as ‚Äòcarcinogenic‚Äô. 

http://www.5gappeal.eu/the-5g-appeal/

&gt; 5G leads to massive increase of mandatory exposure to wireless radiation. 5G technology is effective only over short distance. It is poorly transmitted through solid material. Many new antennas will be required and full-scale implementation will result in antennas every 10 to 12 houses in urban areas, thus massively increasing mandatory exposure. With ‚Äùthe ever more extensive use of wireless technologies,‚Äù nobody can avoid to be exposed. Because on top of the increased number of 5G-transmitters (even within housing, shops and in hospitals) according to estimates, ‚Äù10 to 20 billion connections‚Äù (to refrigerators, washing machines, surveillance cameras, self-driving cars and buses, etc.) will be parts of the Internet of Things. All these together can cause a substantial increase in the total, long term RF-EMF exposure to all EU citizens. Harmful effects of RF-EMF exposure are already proven. Over 230 scientists from more than 40 countries have expressed their ‚Äúserious concerns‚Äù regarding the ubiquitous and increasing exposure to EMF generated by electric and wireless devices already before the additional 5G roll-out. They refer to the fact that ‚Äùnumerous recent scientific publications have shown that EMF affects living organisms at levels well below most international and national guidelines‚Äù. Effects include increased cancer risk, cellular stress, increase in harmful free radicals, genetic damages, structural and functional changes of the reproductive system, learning and memory deficits, neurological disorders, and negative impacts on general well-being in humans. Damage goes well beyond the human race, as there is growing evidence of harmful effects to both plants and animals. After the scientists‚Äô appeal was written in 2015 additional research has convincingly confirmed serious health risks from RF-EMF fields from wireless technology.  The world‚Äôs largest study (25 million US dollar) National Toxicology Program (NTP), shows statistically significant increase in the incidence of brain and heart cancer in animals exposed to EMF below the ICNIRP (International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection) guidelines followed by most countries. These results support results in human epidemiological studies on RF radiation and brain tumour risk.  A large number of peer-reviewed scientific reports demonstrate harm to human health from EMFs. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), the cancer agency of the World Health Organization (WHO), in 2011 concluded that EMFs of frequencies 30 KHz ‚Äì 300 GHz are possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B). However, new studies like the NTP study mentioned above and several epidemiological investigations including the latest studies on mobile phone use and brain cancer risks confirm that RF-EMF radiation is carcinogenic to humans. The EUROPA EM-EMF Guideline 2016 states that ‚Äùthere is strong evidence that long-term exposure to certain EMFs is a risk factor for diseases such as certain cancers, Alzheimer‚Äôs disease, and male infertility‚Ä¶Common EHS (electromagnetic hypersensitivity) symptoms include headaches, concentration difficulties, sleep problems, depression, lack of energy, fatigue, and flu-like symptoms.‚Äù An increasing part of the European population is affected by ill health symptoms that have for many years been linked to exposure to EMF and wireless radiation in the scientific literature. The International Scientific Declaration on EHS &amp; multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS), Brussels 2015, declares that: ‚ÄúIn view of our present scientific knowledge, we thereby stress all national and international bodies and institutions‚Ä¶to recognize EHS and MCS as true medical conditions which acting as sentinel diseases may create a major public health concern in years to come worldwide i.e. in all the countries implementing unrestricted use of electromagnetic field-based wireless technologies and marketed chemical substances‚Ä¶ Inaction is a cost to society and is not an option anymore‚Ä¶ we unanimously acknowledge this serious hazard to public health‚Ä¶that major primary prevention measures are adopted and prioritized, to face this worldwide pan-epidemic in perspective.‚Äù",England,/r/europe/comments/c3cdcz/telenor_sets_up_first_5g_base_station_in_serbia/erqampn/,Bloke22,1561138952

1812,"&gt;I was referring to the notorious recent case of the 7-year-old girl with scepsis: She was sent to hospital by helicopter while in detention. There was nothing more the guards could do.

From your link:

&gt;""When Jakelin Caal Maquin presented to the Border Patrol facility in New Mexico, **there was no specific review of experiences, signs or symptoms that would have identified that she was sick,**"" said Rep. Raul Ruiz, D-Calif., in an interview with NPR. **""There was no physical examination including a very basic vital signs that would have most likely identified that she had a fever ... or a fast heart rate.""**

According to The New York Times, several physicians who reviewed the autopsy report said **Jakelin ""would have been visibly sick for many hours.""**

**""Something definitely went wrong and is wrong with our system**, that we need to correct by creating a set of humanitarian standards that the CBP must abide by which would include a meaningful health screening, a meaningful coordination with health trained providers that can give guidance and the care that is needed,"" Ruiz said. 

That's not the same as ""*There was nothing more the guards could do.*"". Are you even reading the stuff you're linking in here?

&gt;And I'm saying that most people don't think of the general historical defintion of conentration camp. We associate the term automatically with nazis. AOC reinforced this connotation by stating ""never forget"".

And she did the correct thing, and even [historians agree with her](https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a27813648/concentration-camps-southern-border-migrant-detention-facilities-trump/):

&gt;""What's required is a little bit of demystification of it,"" says Waitman Wade Beorn, a Holocaust and genocide studies historian and a lecturer at the University of Virginia. ""Things can be concentration camps without being Dachau or Auschwitz. Concentration camps in general have always been designed‚Äîat the most basic level‚Äîto separate one group of people from another group. Usually, because the majority group, or the creators of the camp, deem the people they're putting in it to be dangerous or undesirable in some way.""

&gt;I also disagree because even non-Nazi concentration camps led to the deaths of thousands.

They didn't at first! Dachau was opened in 1933 and was staffed by the German police. There were no deaths in the first years. Yet we still rightfully call them concentration camps.

That's only a few months worth of data. Most of the people in the dataset probably haven't even had trials yet. And that's ignoring the fact that even the ones who do show up will often ignore or flee the deportation order if they lose. The justice department puts it at around 50-60% show up which is more than I thought, I admit, but still an absurd number of them simply disappear. And again that doesn't count the ones who do show up to the trial but avoid being deported anyway.

1824,"&gt; The Byzantines were very, very rich, exponentially more rich than any other empire in the world. 

&amp;#x200B;

Compared to Western Europe, absolutely. Their skill in silk manufacturing was second-to-none apart from those  craftsmen of China at the time, and allowed them to absolutely dominate diplomatic interactions. As for wealth though, well undoubtedly they were incredibly wealthy up until the second Sassanian war and Arab conquests, when they completely fucked it. For those two centuries afterwards, they were in a complete dark age, little more than a client state and military playground for the vastly wealthier Ummayyad and 'Abbasid caliphates. 

&amp;#x200B;

This professor was more than convincing too. If you look at the sheer number of coin hordes found in Eastern and Northern Europe, they exceed by several hundred orders of magnitude the Byzantine coin hordes. This could just indicate that Arabs at the time were just really interested in Slavic trades, but there's a reason why the Rus, for instance, sold their slaves for Abbasid gold and silver rather than Byzantine specie.

How does it not lend itself to this? Like I said in my original comment on this thread, this isn't FPTP. The President doesn't have to be the Spitzenkandidat whose party got the most votes, just the one that can get a majority of MEPs behind them.

1957,"&gt;&gt;Here we go again with your false dilemma. Why do you think that condemning racism is a fulltime job that makes it impossible to do anything else?
&gt;I didn't say such a thing. I say you are not going to fix the problem with a constant approach of yelling at people they are racist **instead** of addressing the underlying issues leading to their extremist thoughts.

I bolded the keyword. You are now repeating even that you think that it's not possible to combine both.

&gt;No, and that is the whole point I am making. Because that doesn't happen, you need to win them over on an emotional level also, and that can't be done by constantly saying they are the problem. They don't see it that way. So you need another approach to win them over and change their ways.

Like I said above, racism and racist actions are the problem, not people, even if they do something wrong at some point. That's the whole point of being equal opportunity and anti-racist. You can't let them say brown people are the problem either.

&gt;I am not saying we should apologize for anything. Please read my posts instead of repeating the same things I have addresses dozens of times by now.

You are saying that we should not voice disapproval of racism, that we instead should shut up and try to offer something more seductive. No. Racism is not acceptable, the stick is totally appropriate. Of course it works better with a carrot, but like I said, and like you ignored, people don't vote for racist parties because of their well though out programs that adequately address their problem. Leftist parties offer plenty of carrots, and have always been doing so. It's not the lack of carrots that made people vote racist.

&gt;So does income inequality, cutting services, having villages being left behind, etc, etc. Those issues are all real. By not seeing it that way, you are driving people away from your platform and into the hands of groups that do see those as real issues.

That's stuff that leftists have been addressing all along. They lost votes to racist parties who blamed the brown, and rightwing parties who blamed the left for the hole in the budget. You can't seriously say that people vote for racist politicians because they want a more leftwing policy.

&gt;Very strange comparison to say the least.

I give the explanation right beneath it, but at this point it's abundantly clear that you don't really care about having a conversation, but just want to repeat your talking points.

&gt; am not talking about bargaining.

Yes, you are. You are saying that racism is totally acceptable expression of dissatisfaction, and we can't tell people that's harmful, but instead we should try to suck their dicks to make them like us more. Maybe. And if that doesn't work, suck harder. That's your suggestion.

&gt;I am talking about fixing the root issues that drive these people to these extremist ways.

No, you are not. In this whole conversation branch you haven't even tried to say what kind of policies the left has missed, or tried point at a policy that would fix that, besides spouting some buzzwords that you didn't follow up on. 90% of your talk is about how the left should stop condemning racism.

&gt;You didn't answer my question in the end by the way, but talked around it.

I don't accept your false dilemma that is implicit in your question. I have been very clear about that from the beginning, so it's either a rhetorical trap that you try to pull again, or a very strong misunderstanding in your own thought. 

If you actually have an idea of a policy that you think would lure voters for the extreme right back, go ahead.

2061,"&gt; The old problem with communism is productivity, 

Is it.

&gt; you kind of understand why collectivization has systematically been a disaster

I don't.

If it was *systematic* disaster, Soviets would've had famine late 30s, they wouldn't be able to wage war in the 40s (as they wouldn't have the manpower), and they would've had famines throughout the 50s and all the way until the 90s.

I mean, let's compare it to actually *systematic* disasters.

As you might be aware, unregulated market is often subjected to ""market panics"", when the price of goods is not just rising but rises faster (and higher) than would be ""naturally"" expected, since traders try to acquire a lot of said goods and avoid selling them in expectation of higher pay-offs later (as the price is expected to be higher). And, since a lot of traders do it, the price *will* keep rising even when there is no real reason (other than expectations of higher prices becoming self-fulfilling prophecy).

The food market is perfect for such a ""panic"" (IRL only buyers are panicking; sellers are ecstatic), as there is no way for demand to stop or be easily satisfied (ex. on average, in Russian Empire prices would increase 3-4 times; the profit is massive). Which is why, food markets - when they started to expand as means of food distribution; during transition from feudal economies - would have a tendency to get such ""panics"" every few years, as grain traders would get conditioned to stop selling and start hoarding whenever there is a *possibility* of market panic.

I.e. even rumours could be sufficient to cause such a panic (as most traders would decide to postpone selling, since the losses due to mistake would be minimal, while the benefits could be immense), thereby creating *actual* famines (since many people would be unable to afford food at new price) even when there is enough food.

* **NB:** this is also what was going on in the background of French Revolution (starting with Ancien Regime and all the way to post-Napoleon period). Don't forget to note how the French kulaks &gt;!(I'm not sure if you know, but term means grain merchant, not productive farmer as some claim)!&lt; were hated and villified by the general public, as well as the general hysteria before ascribing such phenomena in Russia and China to the propaganda efforts of Bolsheviks and Maoists.

This is an example of *actually* systematic disasters: food market will be systematically generating famines, unless you'll have some form of regulation (or massively overproduce food).

Collectivization clearly did not have such mechanisms, as created system could function without such crises. 

* But, I'm guessing, you have a different opinion since you refer to some ""immense pain"". 

&amp;nbsp;

P.s. also, you (or Kotkin, or whoever gave you wrong impression) miss that part where collectivization is not communism. It is - in essence - enforcement of Petit-Bourgeois relations of production in farming sector (because that's what farmer-owned agrarian co-ops are).",World Socialist Republic,/r/europe/comments/c2uxlc/socialists_and_liberals_kick_epps_weber_out_of_eu/erpgqrw/,S_T_P,1561116765

Neah. You're behaving like a russian troll that asks for ""proof"" when you don't understand how things work. You're using a type of speech that does **NOT** apply to the current situation.


&gt; keep your arguments based on facts, not assumptions.

Said the person that assumes an MP moonlights as a security guard. 

&gt; The burden of proof is on the person making a statement about ‚ÄúMPs not having training‚Äù... a general statement about one specific living person...

Like a russian troll **you are parroting** big words that you don't understand. You don't understand what burder of proof means. 

Burder of proof doesn't mean that **everything** is true or false randomly. Burden of proof means there's a status quo and there's an unusual claim. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_hypothesis

&gt; In inferential statistics, the null hypothesis is a general statement or **default position** that there is no relationship between two measured phenomena, or no association among groups.

**The default assumption is that MPs don't have training into manhandling protestors.** 
 
why?

* People aren't born with the skills of manhandling people. It's a learnt thing. 

* MPs have no obligation to learn how to manhandle people. 

**THUS** any reasonable **null** or **default** assumption is that an MP has no skills of a security guard.

2263,"It is not impossible.

There is a tension that exists in all republics: that between the will of the voters and the policies enacted. We elect representative to temper our worst impulses, and ensure that there is some reasonable degree of policy continuity.

However, the distance between the views of the body politic and the policies enacted is where fascism can find fertile ground. Eventually, trust in government reaches a point where voters would prefer a candidate with fascist leanings (fascists don't declare themselves to be so until they've consolidated power) because their policy preferences are not being met.

Which leads to a fundamental danger to democracy: what happens when voters want something that politicians are unwilling or unable to deliver within the boundaries of the present political system.

The two most relevant examples are immigration and Brexit (which was also about immigration to a degree.) For a long time, a supermajority of voters in most W. European countries have been against immigration to their country from outside the EU, and have been ignored. At some points, the French will have their voice heard on this issue, but for the last 20 years immigration to France from Africa and the middle east has been constant. There is a similar situation in Britain, where for decades Brits have told pollsters that there is too much migration. 

Now, on to Brexit. To put it simply, you cannot send out a voters pamphlet that says ""we will implement your decision"" and then not implement it and maintain the same democratic legitimacy as before. In my view, politicians within the UK are afraid of the far-right, but haven't read up on their history. Extremist parties arise in the event of mass disaffection with the status quo, not a vacuum. There is, I think, some arrogance on the part of elites within democratic countries, that small l liberalism is a sort of governmental permanence, when there is no particular reason to think so. I cannot predict the future, but if I were a British fascist in 2040 and Brexit had never been enacted, or been some form of Brexit in name only, that would be the propaganda message I would sell to voters.

#TL;DR: Yes, fascism can make a comeback if the political elite ignore the will of the masses for too long.",,/r/europe/comments/c2wxes/could_fascism_ever_make_a_comeback/erp6vtg/,TreebeardButIntoBDSM,1561102541

2310,"Depends where. Hard to say. Roman empire was diverse stretching from spain to egypt and everything in between. We mostly know what the patrician class and the emperors look like because they were important enough to write down. 

https://www.theapricity.com/earlson/history/emperors.htm

You can tell by the descriptions that many of the patrician class would be told to check their 'white' privilege and how they were colonizers of the Egyptians and north Africans by many educated westerners these days.

Anyway, here is some ancient roman art from pompei if you are interested(note that some of this is NFSW)

&gt; The United States has its own ‚Äúone China‚Äù policy (vs. the PRC‚Äôs ‚Äúone China‚Äù principle) and position on Taiwan‚Äôs status. Not recognizing the PRC‚Äôs claim over Taiwan nor Taiwan as a sovereign state, U.S. policy has considered Taiwan‚Äôs status as unsettled. Since a declaration by President Truman on June 27, 1950, during the Korean War, the United States has supported a future determination of the island‚Äôs status in a peaceful manner. **The United States did not state a stance on the sovereign status of Taiwan in the three U.S.-PRC Joint Communiqu√©s of 1972, 1979, and 1982. The United States simply ‚Äúacknowledged‚Äù the ‚Äúone China‚Äù position of both sides of the Taiwan Strait.** Washington has not promised to end arms sales to Taiwan for its selfdefense, although the Mutual Defense Treaty of 1954 terminated on December 31, 1979. U.S. policy does not support or oppose Taiwan‚Äôs independence; U.S. policy takes a neutral position of ‚Äúnon-support‚Äù for Taiwan‚Äôs independence. U.S. policy leaves the Taiwan question to be resolved by the people on both sides of the strait: a ‚Äúpeaceful resolution,‚Äù with the assent of Taiwan‚Äôs people in a democratic manner, and without unilateral changes. In short, U.S. policy focuses on the process of resolution of the Taiwan question, not any set outcome.

This was taken directly from page 4 of the [Congressional Research Service report titled U.S.-Taiwan Relationship: Overview of Policy Issues](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R41952.pdf)

""Acknowledged"" instead of ""recognized"" is actually a very important distinction. [China even tried to change ""acknowledge"" to ""recognize""](https://www.csis.org/analysis/what-us-one-china-policy-and-why-does-it-matter)(non-US-government source):

&gt;The United States did not, however, give in to Chinese demands that it recognize Chinese sovereignty over Taiwan (which is the name preferred by the United States since it opted to de-recognize the ROC). Instead, Washington acknowledged the Chinese position that Taiwan was part of China. For geopolitical reasons, both the United States and the PRC were willing to go forward with diplomatic recognition despite their differences on this matter. **When China attempted to change the Chinese text from the original acknowledge to recognize, Deputy Secretary of State Warren Christopher told a Senate hearing questioner, ‚Äú[W]e regard the English text as being the binding text. We regard the word ‚Äòacknowledge‚Äô as being the word that is determinative for the U.S.‚Äù**",,/r/europe/comments/c2iwrm/taiwan_urges_europe_to_help_it_stand_up_to_china/erou4p6/,Eclipsed830,1561088798

&gt; 2506 persons out of 102,761 rejected asylum seekers who have voluntarily left the country, have applied for asylum following their re-entry in the years 2017 to 2019"", according to a response from the Federal Government, which emerges from a request by the FDP Group.

So.  A few example cases.

* Some percentage of people probably simply got to Germany and applied for asylum as soon as they got across the border.  They then took funds, went back, came over and then immediately applied for asylum as soon as they crossed the border.  This seems to me that it would indicate a misunderstanding of how the system works, or maybe an effort to get a different person examining their case.  These would be counted.

* Some people probably got to Germany, applied for asylum, were rejected, took the money, and then came back to try the same thing in another country.  I am not sure from the wording whether these would be counted (applied for asylum in *Germany* or another country?)

* Came to Germany, applied for asylum, were rejected, took money, came back with the aim of working illegally and are not known to the border system system.  Won't be counted.

* Came to Germany, tried to pass through or work illegally but were part of N% caught, applied for asylum as a roll of the dice, were rejected, took money, came back to try again and were caught but didn't bother to try to apply for asylum since they knew that they'd be rejected.  From the wording, won't be counted, though this should probably be counted against the program.

* Came to Germany, were among N% caught (say 25%), applied for asylum as a roll of the dice, were rejected, took money, came back, and weren't caught.  The ""catch"" ratio will be a fraction of the real returnees.

* Came to Germany, were among N% caught, applied for asylum, rejected, took money, returned, but were better at avoiding being picked up based on their experience the first time around, and only were picked up at the lower rate of M%.",üá∫üá∏ United States of America,/r/europe/comments/c2zvx6/over_2500_foreigners_travelled_back_to_germany_in/erough5/,vokegaf,1561089059

Sorry, that's not really what I'm looking for. Some weird statistical table with results of something mysterious among the schoolchildren is not really a demonstration of lack of discrimination. You probably don't see any differences because you live around it, and generally expect ""tibla"" to be rather moronic lower-class lumpmen, but, believe it or not - it's not a natural situation for Slavic population. Even your shitty table clearly shows ethnic Estonians to be considerably ahead - I guess that's probably explained by their inborn genius, right? After all centuries of agricultural serfdom under Danish/Swedish/German overlords and then Kolkhoz operation will certainly create intellectual giants. Yep.

When (many years ago) I had a gig doing over-the-phone translation for various British organisations, I could tell the general region of person's origin just by the first sentence - younger ""pribaltika"" natives speech sounded like something straight out of prison. The amount of degradation for the descendants of employees in the Soviet high-tech industry is quite eye-opening, but not really surprising.

Lack of native education will do that to a person, and education in foreign, barely related (in Latvia - completely unrelated in Estonia) language is hardly a substitute, and will always put them at a disadvantage. Shit, American scientists have made claims that their black population is getting discriminated against because they're being taught in *unfamiliar dialect* (of their **native** English, of course), which compounded their lower achievement rates.

PS. It's really telling that you used a table that demonstrates discrimination (uniformly lower achievement rates for Slavic students vs Finnic ones) in order to disprove discrimination.

Climate change is a topic either way, regardless of politicians stance on it. It's happening whether politicians care about it or not. We can't avoid climate change, but only mitigate the damages at this point. 

We can only mitigate (at best) and not solve the problem because politicians didn't care to act in time. It's a proof of their incompetence and/or corruption more than anything.

2564,"The sub is bridgaded with nationalistic maniacs. Most of them repeat the high school curriculum which is history with the reasoning parts and errors made by Turks are stripped. It is the bad heritage of 1980 military coup that aimed to grow a submissive society. I am sure none of them has read any book written by credible historians. I mean even the Turkish ones. 

Firstly, if you think Ottomans like Turkish Berserkers, no they were not. Most of the Turkish/Turkic population in Anatolia is subdued and turned into dark medieval society because of Mongolian raids. Mongolians burned the cities down to ash, destroying the culture and the positive sciences in Islamic world. People turned into religion as a natural response as richness and culture taken away from them. They inherited a lot of technology from the old nations and still had closer access to trade routes.

The first Ottoman sultans were clever and exploited the shortcomings of Byzantine and Balkan nations. They did a good job creating a very central government and came up with systems like Janissaries that prevent Turkish dynasties/clangs messing with the government. Rather than dealing with the craze in Anatolia they continued to exploit Byzantium. Using the resources they have grown more and more. They had the technological advantage and many Turkic people migrated to Ottoman state (wasn't Empire then) from Asia and the other feudal states. They had the manpower, they had the technology. The power differential would only result in cruelty and conquests as it happened in the history again and again. It wasn't the Turks who only did this but Europeans, Chinese, Japanese everyone. The religion also played a great role because it is the perfect ""inhumanization"" agent. It prevents people from seeing each other as humans. It still happens. Christian hate in Muslim societies is a reality as Muslim hate in Christian societies is or similarly Hindus vs Muslims. The history would be written very differently if by chance Turks had accepted Christianity. They would probably still take out Byzantine if it was weak enough. And let's accept that the fear and hate of Turks caused the ""discoveries"". Ottoman throne is also cruel to its Muslim population. They were forced to be scouts and front line units that keep the opponents occupied until Janissaries came. 

It wasn't like Ottoman sultans were culture-less swines. Some of them tried to do reforms. Mehmet II tried to retain Greeks and Armenians. He wasn't liked by the religious scholars and imams. He is an infidel in the eyes of them and he had his picture painted which is forbidden by Islam. He wasn't liked by the Muslim public too. That's why they kicked his similar minded son, Cem, out of the country and placed his pacifist and backwards minded son Bayezid on the throne. Very strong central structure prevented alternative ideas to emerge and gain traction. While feudal structure of Europe helped the movements like Renaissance and Reform.

However, defining Ottoman Empire by only cruelty is not fair. It caused a lot of cultural exchange between nations. The exchange especially in Balkans, in fact, caused a mind like Mustafa Kemal to grow in. It is not a coincidence that such a person can grow in that society. Ottoman Balkans was a pot of nations where the ideals like democracy, equality and sciences can penetrate. The constant war-like situation caused him and his friends to learn and gain military experience very early and quickly and helped them to re-form an old and exhausted empire to a republic.",üá©üá™,/r/europe/comments/c2wfnl/on_this_day_560_years_ago_smederevo_fell_to_the/eromzrs/,idontchooseanid,1561083274

That's the kind of demographic eclipse you won't ever recover from and you can see the devastation in the countryside.

But the situation around this particular issue is more complicated, and the real '3D chess' happens on another front: The domestic one in Germany.

It pays to remember that the first public office Merkel ever held was the Department of the Environment, way back in the 1990s under Helmut Kohl (who immediately knew that she is just shrewed as he was, that's why the kept her so close).

Merkel is *not* the one putting the brakes on things like climate action or especially the coal phase-out. The rest of her own party is, in particular the ""prince-electors"" (i.e. the minister-presidents of various German states). Why is that? Well, just look at that [map of German coal power plants](https://cdn1.spiegel.de/images/image-984265-galleryV9-immm-984265.jpg). Most of them are in regions where the CDU either is in power (Northrhine-Westphalia) or hope hopes to win the next elections this fall (East Germany). These guys have something to lose if all those plants are shut down and the blue collars working in them get the pink slips too soon. 

Merkel was the first one to endorse the French initiative on mandatory emission targets, because having the EU *mandate* them would alleviate Merkel's pain of explaining to her own party that coal needs to go - because ""it was Brussels"", which (at least publicly) means that Berlin can't do anything.",Charlemagnia - personally vouching for /u/-ah,/r/europe/comments/c322a6/how_the_european_council_voted_on_the_goal_of_net/erob4g4/,ColourFox,1561073874

Well, just briefly - citizenship and voting rights, then Russian school cut-backs (with requirement for x% of ""national language"" subjects) and closures, and finally - statue and symbol removal and banning. Not to mention the general discrimination that's hard to pinpoint in any particular way but is now noticeable when speaking to younger generation of Baltic Slavs - they are typically less educated and more prone to underclass lingo and mannerisms than their counterparts in majority-Slavic nations.

Basically, you've progressively lumpmenised them through various clearly discriminatory measures. Somehow you've all convinced yourselves that it was an okay thing to do (even though nobody has ever done anything of the sort on this continent), so it seems normal to you.

 In some ways, yes. We‚Äôre superior in intelligence. We‚Äôre not superior in our ability to fly or see in the dark. It could be argued that some humans are superior to other humans in certain areas. Some humans are smarter, faster, stronger, better looking and so on. By this logic, the ‚Äúsuperior‚Äù humans could in theory abuse the ‚Äúinferior‚Äù ones.
Superiority doesn‚Äôt grant us a right to abuse other sentient beings. In fact, this line of thinking is what justified many atrocities in the past, like The Holocaust, black segregation, disenfranchisement of women, and so on. Of course, nobody wants animals to have the same rights as humans, like the right to vote, because this doesn‚Äôt make sense. What does make sense, however, is to grant them the right to life because their sentience means they have an interest to live, just like us.

""Animals would eat us""
What logical conclusion follows from this? If an animal would like to eat us, does that mean we should base our morality on less intelligent animals and eat other animals too? The interesting thing is that people like you use this argument to justify eating herbivorous animals that can‚Äôt eat us, like pigs and cows, but they don‚Äôt use it to justify eating cats, lions and bears, that¬†could.

To think your tastebuds are superior than any animals life is just impressively egoistic. So aninals should suffer for your tastebuds?

Nope, it really isn't.

&gt;Heck even if the Spanish had kicked out the visigoths it would have been a 'reconquest'.

All depends on when they did it.

&gt;The expulsion of a power that came from outside the peninsula is by definition a reconquest.

Not when they were pretty well entrenched in the peninsula by that point.

&gt;The Visigoths conquered Spain and then their lands were conquered by the Moors. So by taking it back from people who continued the legacy of that Conquest they did in fact perform a 'reconquest'.

They 'continued the legacy' in name only.

&gt;That's because you're projecting your modern grievances onto history.

LMAO the projection is unreal here.

2892,"&gt; You're literally doing a textbook definition of a straw man argument right now. Good job bud.

Very nice, good job not responding to it

&gt;No. They weren't.

Then why did the teacher bring up gender discussion while teaching? For the hell of it?

&gt;It's not ""silencing any dissent"". The kid is perfectly allowed to protest for legislation changes outside of school.

It is. The teacher is physically removing a child from a classroom for having an opinion that is contrary to the what the curriculum says. 

&gt;Or do you think it'd also be accepted to start arguing about the merits of creationism during a lesson on Evolution in Science?

Obviously? Did you never go to a school? We were even taught about quack science like Lamarckism and compared it to evolution as we know it today. Discourse is essential to learning and understanding new ideas.

&gt;You're cool with disrupting a lesson so that kids aren't able to move on from one topic and learn new things, right?

The teacher could've simply told the student to be quiet, or even just moved on from the topic with a simple ""anyway, now we're going to do this..."". It was the teacher's decision to *physically remove* (removing a child from a class should always be used as a last resort, not as a first course of action) the child from the class and waste time on 'lecturing' him on gov't policy. 

&gt;Really? You were taught to interrupt a lesson when the teacher stated something and continue to do so after being told to stop it?

We were taught to think critically, ask questions, and exchange ideas. Not sure why you're strawmanning this.

&gt;Not for voicing an opinion, for interrupting the lesson when told to stop. It doesn't matter if he was advocating for transgender people to become the fucking king of England, it was still interrupting the lesson when he was told to stop.

It's clear from the video that the teacher's problem isn't disruption, it's that what the student is saying is contrary to what the curriculum says. I understand that a class may be a foreign environment for you, but usually there are disciplinary procedures in place to sort out disruptive children. Physically removing a child from a class is *always* an action that should be used as a last resort, not for a student that merely states his opinion.

&gt;During a lesson? Yea. A lesson isn't the time or place to be arguing about government policies.

Except in history, geography, RE, economics, business studies, citizenship, etc.

Hell, there are even GCSE classes for sociology, politics, psychology, etc. Gov't policies are a part of everyday life and with some of these subjects talking about them is a necessity. 

&gt;Do you think schools are just a massive debate hall where students can talk about whatever they want when being told to stop interrupting the lesson?

BRRT BRRT strawman alert. Thank you for putting words in my mouth. I've made my point clear multiple times now, read up.

&gt;I'm sure you'd totally support this student if his name was Muhammed and it was a lesson on Christianity in R.E where he repeatedly interrupted and called Christianity a lie and talking about how the only true god is Allah right?

I've had that happen in RE before actually, and the class actually had a splendid discussion on the differences between Islam and Christianity, how they're similar, and why my classmates believed in different religions.

2903,"I agree, socialism, is not always transitional to communism. Quite the contrary, socialism, in practice, throughout the world, from economic perspective, is used as a complementary to capitalism. It establishes an economic baseline, a safety net (when done right) and long-term it tries to minimize economic differences between rich and poor, trying to maintain a society in which all social classes progress together instead of diverging. To much capitalism and you end up with parallel societies, gethos, gated communities, too much socialism and instead of redistributing wealth you end up distributing poverty.",Romania,/r/europe/comments/c2uxlc/socialists_and_liberals_kick_epps_weber_out_of_eu/ernfhgd/,adri4n85,1561051494
2904,"The treaties state that the European Council (the heads of Government from the member states) will propose candidates for Commission president, the College of Commissioners, the HRVP (foreign affairs minister), the ECB (European Central Bank) president, and the European Council president. All of these positions, except for the European Council president, have to be voted on by the European Parliament after the nomination from the European Council

With respect to the College of Commissioners, there is 28 in total. Each member state gets 1 commissioner. The commissioner makes a pledge before the ECJ (European Court of Justice) to say that they will not consider national concerns and will instead act in the best interest of the European people and Union. Once the member states have finished nominating commissioners, the parliament scrutinises each and every one of them before the college of commissioners is put to a vote in the parliament. If they are rejected, the Council has to nominate a new commissioner.

With respect to the European Commission President, the ECB president, and the HRVP, the European Council nominates a person through a qualified majority. The positions of these nominations are then subject to a vote of the European Parliament. If the EP rejects them, then the European Council must propose a new candidate. 

Now here's where it gets a bit tricky. The treaties state that the European Council will propose a European Commission president taking into account the composition of the European Parliament. The European Parliament has been a bit clever though and have interpreted this to mean that the European Council must nominate a person who has campaigned for a European political group as the main candidate (spitzenkandidaten). Take a look at them [here](https://europeelects.eu/2019spitzenkandidaten/). So not only do you have power struggles between member states on leadership positions, you have the European Parliament, directly elected by the people, and the European Council, indirectly representing the people, vying for power.

And while the President formally does not have that much more power than the other members of the Board, this works quite different in practice. Plus, the President is the figurehead and spokesperson for the Board. He is the one everyone is looking at, and a lot hinges on his (or her) credibility.

Draghi convinced the market in 2012 that the ECB is willing and able to do whatever it has to keep the Eurozone intact. Weidmann is a known hawk who has opposed programmes like QE. Should he be made President, the perception will shift towards the ECB being more flexible w.r.t. to protecting countries like Greece, Italy, and Spain, which will set the Eurozone up for the next debt crisis. And with rates still at record lows and an increasingly weakening economy, they don't have a lot of ammunition to fight that. And whatever non-traditional instruments they possess, Weidmann would be unwilling to use.

3147,"Alright, before I answer your question, I'll own up to this - I am biased, as a person who believes that there is a spectrum with male at one end, female at the other and a few stops between.

So it depends how you want to define it. However, even on a purely biological stance, there's not only two. 

Biologically, you have various types of intersex people's, which is people who can't be put on the two-gender dots:

You can have a penis and testicles, a vagina, or both, or a combination (penis and vagina, no testicles) So purely on a genital perspective, more than two.

You can be biologically male, but have an overabundance of female sex hormones, or vice versa. So on a hormone and chemical level, there's more than two.

Chromosomally, you can have multiple options. Men are XY, women are XY, so what of XXY/XXX/XYY//YY/YYY* people? What of people with syndromes like Kleinfelter or Turner's? What of people with mosaic chromosomes?

Then you have other questionable physical characteristics:

If you count brains, on average, the ratio of grey:white brain matter is 4% higher in men, so you could argue that a woman with over 4% higher than average ratio is male. Extremely tenuous, but again, an argument.

Some men have sympathy symptoms when with certain women, such as pseudo-lactation and breast swelling when their partner is pregnant, or a pseudo-period if their partner/housemates are on theirs, or getting a man period where they essentially get PMS. Are they women because their body does this? 

Body hair, or even head hair, being particularly present or missing, or its coarseness. Is a hairless man less of a man, or a hairier woman less of a woman? 

Body fat distribution - is a guy with a big bum and small waist a woman? A woman with slim hips and small breasts a man? 

Genital shapes and sizes. Does a micropenis prevent you from being a man? A dry vagina prevent you from being a woman? Does the size of your breasts alter your gender? Is Keira Knightly a man because she has small breasts? Is meatloaf a woman because he has large moobs?

You may have a uterus with no vagina, or fallopian tubes but no ovaries, which means that on the male/female discrete sets, then this person must be male as they lack all female anatomy.

Then you have all the stuff that makes the right cry themselves to sleep - gender roles, psychology, brain chemistry - all the stuff that is loudly discussed. 

From almost every angle there is more than two genders.

Similarly steam turbines are also kept in sync with the grid, although they also serve as massive flywheels to keep grid power demand fluctuations under control.

3194,"&gt; What do you think would help in Italy?

If you mean in terms of advertising, I've no idea.  I think that it'd require a lot more familiarity with the Italian society and political scene than I have to make much of a call.

If you mean in terms of subsidies or incentives, people have looked at different types of subsidies and their relative effects.  Their effect probably differs somewhat from one place to another, but it'd probably be a good place to start.  Things like having some link between pensions and raising kids are kinda agnostic.

It does seem to me that today, at least with present welfare models and incentives, people just don't want to have enough children to keep the society going.  Takes effort to raise a kid, and the state will require the kids other people raise to support you in your old age anyway.

Being religious in the world and in the US (though oddly, this does not seem to me to be the case in Europe, where Poland has few children) is strongly correlated with having more children, but even if one wanted higher religiosity as a fix, I don't see how it'd be practical to make people religious.

One big recentish falloff in fertility happened when The Pill was introduced.  I don't think that most people are gonna want to get rid of it, though.

In terms of economic efficiency, I'd say that it's probably preferable to have organizations (think boarding schools, stuff like that) take on a larger role, because they can leverage scale and specialization ‚Äî one adult-hour of labor can raise more children that way.  That could make it cheaper to have kids.  As a result, I'm vaguely-interested in possibilities opened up by having things shift that way ‚Äî smaller parental role, greater role of institutions.  That's a whole 'nother can of worms, though, because it'd have all kinds of other social side effects too ‚Äî that'd be a radical change to society, and it'd undoubtedly break structures that we've built around family child-rearing.  As I've mentioned on here before, there are examples of communal child-rearing, but they're limited.  [Israeli *kibbutzim* didn't have much luck with communal child-rearing.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibbutz_communal_child_rearing_and_collective_education)  The Hutterites practice communal child-rearing, and they're doing pretty well, albeit living in a way that may not adapt well to the way most people live today.

Actually on the contrary, more choices and opportunities seems to decrease the number of women in technical fields.

what actually happens is more people move towards the next step, the ""leefloon"", their numbers have been rising at about the same rate as the unemployed have been dropping, people are not finding employment, they are being shifted from one system to the next.

meanwhile, the poverty rate is rising about as fast as people are being kicked out of unemployment, being unable to find work and not having a stable and proper income, they become poorer,

* [Ireland](https://www.populationpyramid.net/ireland/2017/): 4.7 million in 2017, 6.4 million in 2100.
* [Sweden](https://www.populationpyramid.net/sweden/2017/): 9.9 million in 2017, 14.2 million in 2100.

That being said, some of that doesn't help the EU as a whole, because it's just internal movement from one EU state with below-replacement fertility to another EU state with below-replacement fertility.

3284,"&gt;&gt;but demand for labour will not increase, the amount of work stays the same, no matter the wages.
&gt;
&gt;Demand for labour is not a static thing. Many unemployed will create small businesses when pressured. 

how can one start a buissness without capital to invest? where did you hear this myth?

&gt;The problem is, starting a business is hard and claiming benefits is easy, while the payoff is about the same. Thus the unemployment.

claiming benefits require you actually did work before but got fired for reasons outside of your control, starting a buissness requires only capital to invest. if you have capital, a buissness is easyer to do.

neither do we see a rise in new buissnesses by former unemployed...

&gt;
&gt;I mean sure, it would be great if everyone could have a decent living no matter the situation, but this is not the reality we're in.

we could do better when tech was worse and gdp was lower, are you implying that as sociaty gets richer we lose our ability to support the less fortunate?

&gt;Europe's productivity and competitiveness has peaked, and we're paying the price one way or another. From now on it's either lower wages, or eventual government defaults.

or we do like we used to, and revert the tax cuts on the wealthy, who seem to be making more profits then ever before but are unwilling to support the states that enabled them to become so wealthy in the first place...",,/r/europe/comments/c2u9t0/macrons_government_unveils_tough_reform_of/ermn1lg/,thenewsheogorath,1561030563
3285,"&gt; Maybe Belgium had low unemployment to begin with? Because France and the rest of southern Europe has abnormally high unemployment. Certainly at least for a portion of those people not working is a choice.

Or not. You have no idea what the situation is in France. There is relatively low unemployment where jobs are available (Paris, mainly). There is high unemployment in regions where there are no jobs (Montpellier / Perpignan, Creuse, ect).

Plus we're not talking about shithole countries like the US and Russia where every man for himself is the norm. Every person working in the country pays quite a lot in unemployment insurance (between 1 and 2% of your cost to employer), and that is not a choice. You can't say ""yea, no way, I'll manage alone"". 

The unemployment system in France is NOT costing money. It is vaguely positive. What is costing money is the whole administration (pole emploi) that was not thought through, has a shiton of redonduncies, and is basically fucked over by every government since it was created. But it is a public service and should not be though of with ROI in mind.

Having a society where you care for the unlucky is the choice of most of the French people, and it is the best way to not end up in a society where political opponents and journalist get killed with polonium.

&gt;the problem is when in Isl–∞m this person is the perfect human 14 centuries later

Most of the women who he married were either older than him or (divorcees) if that's the right word 


His first wife was 15 years older than him and their marriage lasted 25 years 

His second wife was also way way older than him 


Assuming he did marry Aisha when she was 9 

Then why anyone who wants to follow the ""perfect human"" would marry a 9 years old instead of marrying a 60 years old? 

Can you answer that question 

You're dishonest and so is the rest of the ignorant folks here 

You know very well marriage in 7th century Arabia was far more political than merely for desires 

Muhammed married her for one reason, which is to bind his family with Abu Bakr's family which would prove to be a very strategic move later on 

A fucking pedophile who only wants desires doesn't marry a 40 years old woman when he was 25 

Or a 60+ woman when he was in his forties

The Norwegian government right now sucks and and the 4 fat ladies in charge only care about being elected and not for the greater good of the country. 

Erna Solberg sold out to KRF for gaining the conservative Christian majority in the internal election, by throwing the abortion laws under the bus to save her own fat ass. And now they're ruining the railroad, by dividing and selling it. Privatization of such services are only a joke, only a fool would think otherwise. It's not private yet but that's the ambition, and the pioneer countries of railroad such as USA and UK are prime examples of why such a thing is a joke, their railroad service is dysfunctional. 

Mark my words that changing the name to VY will not save the reputation and service of a company, as NSB isn't even responsible for the tracks, but the common Norwegian is to busy complaining, and not smart enough to know what Jernbaneverket is. And I refuse to use the name BaneNOR, which also was millions in the garbage. If the whole point of VY was to start with white sheets, just wait until a train is late and people will complain again, reputation ruined. 

Another service in the works of getting ruined is Posten. Budget cuts to make the public service worse and the private services better is not an improvement, it's just an artificial way of saying that competition is better. Well of course it's better if you sabotage yourself, but the whole competition becomes invalid then if youre not even trying.

The most significant change is the transition towards a much older population structure, resulting in a decrease in the proportion of the working age while the number of the retired population increases. The total number of the older population is projected to increase greatly within the coming decades, with rising proportions of the post-war baby-boom generations reaching retirement.

I have seen with my own eyes how on Dutch national media when the first videos came out, a separatist was going trough the debris and found a ring, he was portrayed as if he stole  it,  


Then later, I see the exact same video on reddit, where the same man is in tears, meticulously numbering every single item he picks up and puts it an sealed bags.

  
I have no love for the separatist, but that was clear cut propaganda, from my own government media, wtf.  


 I think my reasoning is perfectly logical, even if you think I am falling for Russian propaganda, lol, I have no love for the Russian government.  


You know what is idiotic, to have a policy to fly over war zones, especially ones that are just developing and it is clear that a modern army is involved, which we all knew was Russia, except for the incredibly dense, It doesn't excuse downing a civilian aircraft though, but again plenty of blame to go around, I just hope these 4 guys wont be used as a scape-goat, sure give them a fair trail, It wont happen though, No way Russia is going to extradite them, and if they did, these guys would probably be found innocent of actually downing the airplane, maybe they could get other things on them.

What is the fundamental difference between Trump's stated ""America First"" policy and a ""Europe First"" policy? The guy is a baffoon in his method of implementation, but the fundamental argument seems the same.

I've seen a lot of support for the Belt and Road initiatives on /r/Europe. At the same time there have been egregious human rights issues exposed in China that are on a scale that hasn't been present in the West in 30 years. How does Europe reconcile the Muslim concentration camps with their friendly feelings towards China? 

The failure of the Iran nuclear deal is a huge moment for international diplomacy, but I think Europeans fail to see that Obama owns the blame. America has a system for ratifying these deals, and he chose to circumvent it. That was extremely dangerous, and that danger lays at his feet. If he wanted the U.S. to participate, he should have been a statesman at home that could negotiate for it. Unfortunately, it was never a popular policy.

3858,"I really love seeing that shitty fucking argument ""If businesses knew they could get away with paying women less wouldn't they just hire more WOMEN!?!?!?!?"" as if that's the biggest gotcha ever

If businesses knew they'd end up losing rape cases that cost them money, why are so many CEO's rapists?!? Because human beings aren't robotic and can very easily be biased. You know think that a woman with the same education as a man isn't worth the same because she's a woman, or those in charge of hiring could look for traits that are similar to theirs. Men hire more men and men are more often those in charge of hiring.

""Choose a job that requires harder-to-attain skills (hard science vs. liberal arts)"" see that's where we have a problem don't we? Apparently women are quitting en fucking masse, there's something pushing them away from STEM. His answer to that? ""Just choose to go into stem LOL"" It's not an answer. All the advice is going ""shut up and stop wanting to be a human"" which doesn't account for things like the fact that women having children will see a decrease in pay, whereas men will not. If a man and a woman both made the same choice to have a child, only the woman will be penalized. In fact the man might benefit because he's seen as a more capable individual. 

In another thread I've linked the fact that there's only a 5 hour difference in the average work done by men and women per week(and the fact that women work 8,6 hours more than men in the household every week) but your link pretends that there's upwards of 40 hours difference between the average work done by men and women. 

What I find truly baffling about that link is that it pretends that feminists aren't advocating for more women in the ""riskier men's domain"" and that it just runs off with the idea that women can't possibly be discriminated against when attempting to be a part of this (or the fact that feminists are also advocating for more men in the other areas) 

So the reason men make more money is just women are too emotional to make the hard choices and that simple SUPPLY AND DEMAND means women would only be hired! I think it's a bit silly to pretend that a mere 5 hours more per week should warrant a difference in pay by about 30%",Denmark,/r/europe/comments/c2j6oj/top_european_technical_university_to_open_jobs/erlhwed/,Flamingasset,1560987615

3894,"&gt; Firstly, the Holy Roman Empire did not consider themselves the successor of the Western Empire, but rather of the Eastern Empire (Western/Eastern Empire are modern constructions, people did not have this paradigm back then).

You cannot say that they considered themselves *at that time* to be successors to the *Eastern* Empire if you're claiming they had no such construction between East and West. It's either one or the other. You can't have it both ways.

&gt; Leo III's core argument for crowning Charlemagne Emperor was that since the Roman Empire was ruled by a woman (Irene of Athens), the throne was vacant and the Pope could therefore appoint a new Emperor in her place.

Yes, and? Are you using this argument to say that the true successor of the ""Roman Empire"" was Costanipole7Byzantium up to that point but then it switched to the HRE? Cause that's what I gather from your point.
 
&gt; Thus according to Leo, Charlemagne was the successor of Constantine VI, not Julius Nepos.

So you're saying the HRE is a/the successor of the Roman Empire, but not the *Western* Roman empire as I phrased it?

&gt; Secondly, can you even call it a successor of the Western Empire when the Holy Roman Empire saw itself as the sole Roman Empire and refused to accept Constantinople's claims? Likewise, the Eastern Empire refused to acknowledge Frankish claims to Romanity, acknowledging merely that they were the Empire of the Franks, not the Romans.

Yes. Because the HRE represented the successor to the territories of the West (the West/East division of the territories had been done in ancient times already, before modern Historians dubbed them as such). 

The fact that they didn't recognize eachother (of course) doesn't change that they both were an offshot of the Roman empire: historically, culturally, dinastically etc, and each of the two reflected a different portion of the old territories.

Even though they didn't use East and West as a means to define their identites back then, the geography of where East and West are doesn't change.",Italy,/r/europe/comments/c2h4o2/roman_emperors/erlinx2/,sparkle_sample,1560988200

I'm not sure what you mean by that and hope you could clarify it, sorry. Because from how I see it, it sounds like ""why does it even exist and who needs it"".

&gt;Why did the Balts destroy their port, which Russia was ready to use?

Same question goes here.

&gt;Do not you think that in 30 years nothing good has been done.

As a child of the post-soviet generation, I can't really compare today and 30 years ago, only from what my family tells. But even if I take a look back to how things were 10 years ago, even then I must say that my home city at least is a more pleasant place to live in despite all financial hardships people I know have/had to endure, low wages among them. The people, too, have changed (for the better), becoming more social and resemble a western society even more.

But I don't want to paint a beautiful picture of how things are. Living in Germany for several years now, the living costs after the introduction of the Euro in Lithuania somewhat suprise me, being hardly bearable for your average elder people rent, and making life somewhat tough for younger people. But I guess the country is doing rather fine considering the state it was in when I was born.

&gt;Why the general trend in the country is the migration to Western Europe.

The financial world crisis hit the country hard, but it recovers. As for people who desire to live in a different region and culture, it's their choice and it isn't always reflective of governance. I'd be lying if I said people migrating have no financial pursuits at all. But as I already said, the crisis hit many people hard and you do what you can to survive. It would however be discriminatory to say this isn't the same for other nations. Russia didn't have it easy either from the amount of russian-speaking immigrants and ""Gastarbeiter"".

At this point I would also like to remark that many people I know don't stay in the western countries they work in for ever.

He's also said he'd make a Citizen's Assembly to solve the issue, but what would be the point of that if Parliament couldn't? And why make one when we already have an elected chamber, and had a referendum on the issue? It's pointless time-wasting.

3931,"&gt;while the HRE was the successor of the Western Roman Empire.

No on two accounts.

Firstly, the Holy Roman Empire did not consider themselves the successor of the Western Empire, but rather of the Eastern Empire (Western/Eastern Empire are modern constructions, people did not have this paradigm back then). 

Leo III's core argument for crowning Charlemagne Emperor was that since the Roman Empire was ruled by a woman (Irene of Athens), the throne was vacant and the Pope could therefore appoint a new Emperor in her place. Thus according to Leo, Charlemagne was the successor of Constantine VI, not Julius Nepos.

Secondly, can you even call it a successor of the **Western** Empire when the Holy Roman Empire saw itself as the **sole** Roman Empire and refused to accept Constantinople's claims? Likewise, the Eastern Empire refused to acknowledge Frankish claims to Romanity, acknoledging merely that they were the Empire of the Franks, not the Romans.",Kingdom of France,/r/europe/comments/c2h4o2/roman_emperors/erl6zqg/,Anthemius_Augustus,1560979800

4078,"&gt; ‚ÄúPeople say it‚Äôs illegal; they say we will lower standards. That‚Äôs a load of baloney,‚Äù Smits says. Some critics say the program discriminates against men. ‚Äú**Yes, absolutely,**‚Äù Smits says. ‚ÄúFor years, men have been discriminating against women, and women haven‚Äôt been paid the same as men for the same jobs.‚Äù

A nice change is admitting it, instead of verbal sleight of hand that leftists so often use in these cases. 

&gt;Biologist Isabelle Vernos, a group leader at the Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG) in Barcelona, Spain, prefers that jobs be open to everyone whenever possible. ‚ÄúBut depending on the discipline, I understand that sometimes you need high-impact action to change a pattern,‚Äù adds Vernos, who is a member of CRG‚Äôs gender balance committee and chairs the European Research Council‚Äôs working group on the same topic.

&gt;**She worries TUE‚Äôs program could place a burden on female recruits**, who may face suspicion about their abilities and anger about the process.

Typical isn't it? Men are outright discriminated against on the basis of them being men, but once again women are the real victims of the injustice.

4177,"&gt;All these arguments can be thrown out of the window because the terrorists could not have known at all if the airplane was military. What can be proven is that they had the intent to shoot down an airplane and kill all inside said airplane, making it murder.

They cannot be thrown out of the window.

They had intent to down a military aircraft. It is not evidenced that there was intent to shoot down a civilian aircraft. The latter is required to establish intent. Rather it is likely that radar information was falsely interpreted or there was a false return leading to the ground crew believing they had targeted a military transporter. This very, very likely was irresponsible, negligent, careless and reckless even - but it is unlikely to qualify as intent to kill civilians.

&gt;Nope, but it's not criminal negligence, it's murder. So (after googling what it means) it's not ne bis in idem.

You claimed it could be both. 

I explained to you extensively by now how you do not really understand the requirements for intent and how those make this to have been murder highly unlikely.

&gt; Changing goalposts are we?

Nope.

&gt; First you are arguing the intent on a specific target is required for murder and now you switch that it should be premeditated intent to kill to be murder.

Premeditated intent on a specific target IS required. Premeditation is just a form of intent, albeit a more demanding one to prove. Intent always has to be on a specific target - in case of murder it has to be intent to kill illegally. Otherwise a soldier is a murderer as well, or someone killing in legitimate self-defence is guilty of manslaughter.

&gt;As a terrorist you don't setup a weapon like a BUK vehicle without thinking that you are going to shoot down airplanes and killing everyone on board.

Again this thing. I already addressed it. Intent to kill was there, but it was a legitimate intent to kill. Yes, wanting to shoot down enemy aircraft is legitimate during armed conflict. It doesn't matter that MH17 wasn't a hostile aircraft, it matters that the operators of the Buk system could realistically have considered it as such.",,/r/europe/comments/c2e6ie/mh17_crash_investigators_to_name_four_suspects/erkkyzy/,Bojarow,1560965751

It actually has to be premeditated (!) as well, so high standards are required.

&gt;Well you could watch the conference, however the prosecutors think the murder charge can stick. Because the intent doesn't need to be an civilian plane, the intent to shoot down any plane can be enough. That's also how other terrorists get trialed.

The article mentions no conference livestream. 

Apart from that, I consider it highly doubtful that it can be established there was intent to commit a murder of non-combatants. Keep in mind this occurred in an **active war zone** where multiple aircraft had been shot down already. It is far more likely that the airliner was considered a legitimate military target.

Nukes used to be fast and cheap.

Don't do any of that. If you do, you'll have a bad time.

Sweat-cooling takes place by the phase transition of evaporation extracting heat from the skin. For that you want the air as dry as possible. If the air is humid, evaporation of sweat is diminished, your body overheats.

Humid air is not automatically cooler air, that's not how reality works.

To cool down you need to transfer heat from your body. One way is to be in direct contact with conductive cooler matter, like cold metal or cold water, or even cold air, but we assume here cold air is not available. Second way is phase transition : a substance, in this case water, needs an additional amount of heat to transition to gaseous state, and if the conditions are right it takes that heat from the surrounding vicinity (your skin) as the transition takes place. The right conditions are when the environment is not saturated with the final state of the substance (water vapor in this case).",Romania,/r/europe/comments/c2ebq1/poland_is_expected_to_have_hottest_june_in/erjr2g2/,manole100,1560943744

&gt; Next to bombing, rent control seems in many cases to be the most efficient technique so far known for destroying cities.

-Assar Lindbeck (Stock Holm school of economics, associated with the modern Nordic welfare state)

&gt;  Almost every freshman-level textbook contains a case study on rent control, using its known adverse side effects to illustrate the principles of supply and demand. Sky-high rents on uncontrolled apartments, because desperate renters have nowhere to go -- and the absence of new apartment construction, despite those high rents, because landlords fear that controls will be extended? Predictable. Bitter relations between tenants and landlords, with an arms race between ever-more ingenious strategies to force tenants out -- what yesterday's article oddly described as ''free-market horror stories'' -- and constantly proliferating regulations designed to block those strategies? Predictable.

4477,"What I find most surprising is that Adidas only registered this as of 2014. Or I'm maybe missing that they meant: ""renewed"" the trademark....figured they would have registered that decades ago. Source from [here](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/06/adidas-stripes-trademark-invalid-eu-court-190619080803562.html) since the Reuters press briefing only mentions the first part and the last sentence. 

&gt;The European Union's second-highest court ruled on Wednesday that Adidas's three-stripe branding was invalid as a trademark as it lacked a distinctive character.

&gt;The General Court of the European Union said it upheld a decision of the European Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) in 2016 to annul a previous decision to accept the mark.

&gt;The German sports goods company registered the trademark in 2014 for clothing, footwear and headgear, saying it consisted of ""three parallel equidistant stripes of equal width applied to the product in whichever direction.""

&gt;However, it was challenged by Belgian company Shoe Branding Europe, with which Adidas has been in a decade-long dispute.

&gt;An EU court rendered Shoe Branding's two-stripe trademark invalid last year, saying the stripes were too similar to the Adidas trademark.

&gt;According to an Adidas spokeswoman, the matter refers only to one specific version of the 3-stripe logo. Extensive trademark protection for other forms of the brand's three stripes remained unaffected by 
the judgement, she added ahead of the decision. 


&gt;Adidas needed to show the mark had acquired a ""distinctive character"" throughout the European Union based on its use, to the point that consumers inherently knew an Adidas product and could distinguish it from another company's products.

&gt;""The mark is not a pattern mark composed of a series of regularly repetitive elements, but an ordinary figurative mark,"" the court wrote in a statement.

&gt;The court also rejected Adidas' argument that the logo had acquired a distinctive character through its use across the EU, noting that the company had only produced relevant evidence relating to five of the 
28 member states.

&gt;Adidas can still appeal to the European Court of Justice.

4525,"&gt;It doesn't say national commercial policy. If it doesn't touch on tariffs, bilateral agreements are free to be signed between countries.

No, it says common commercial policy.. Because the EU involves creating a common market and passing the management of that to the EU, which is why there are common rules across the block..

The Customs union is what covers tariffs.. And again, EU member states cannot enter into trade agreements independently of the EU, they can enter into bilateral agreements on anything else (assuming it doesn't breach union law..) but they can't grant market access to third countries, nor negotiate specific market access for themselves...

&gt;Yes they can, I didn't say they can't. I said it means little to nothing for member states and they rarely ever do that. Check the list of regulations to see how impactful these laws are.

The EU does this all the time... This is what the bulk of the body of EU law is... And they are incredibly 'impactful', they have an impact on practically every bit of internal and external trade, on working conditions, on banking, on signage, labelling and a million other minor and major issues..  

&gt;If you check the net neutrality case in the netherlands, you can see that the national court ruled the Dutch law invalid not one year after it went live. They scrapped it and adopted the EU law not because they were forced by the EU's overruling power but because they decided to.

No, they scrapped it because it was incompatible with EU law.  FFS..

In a separate article the patrol boat type name was mentioned, and through some google-fu i actually found pictures that absolutely matched the visible boat with an Iranian patrol boat type. (Especially the stripes at the front)

This left open what the Iranian soldiers were doing (as isn't not really visible in the video), which has been partially answered with additional pictures the show closeups of the damage including parts of magnets that remained on the hull.

So while this doesn't mean i'm 100% convinced it was Iran, it means i'm 90% convinced, more than enough to ask some hard questions and that might change my stance on the nuclear deal.

For me the question that remains is why? I see no gain Iran could take away from this. Some have said that people might buy more Iranian oil, now that the other sources are more dangerous, but the same is true for itself. (even if we didn't know Iran was responsible)

&amp;#x200B;

My life testimony I never believed that I could get fit again after years of suffering. Only in the last few weeks have I received my already programmed ATM card, which withdraws the maximum of 5,000 euros a day for a maximum of 3 months. I am so happy because I got mine and got 30.000 Euro in only 6 days. MR Mark Robert issues the card just to help the poor and needy, although it is illegal, but it is something nice and he is not like other scammers who pretend to have the empty ATM cards. And nobody gets caught using the card. I am so happy that I told myself that I will not only benefit from it, I have to share with the whole world how this empty MR MARK ROBERT ATM has changed my life. If you read this and you go through any financial problems, I think he can also help you, he is really a nice man, real and a real ATM card[.](https://master.email) email him: [universalhacker.us@outlook.com](mailto:universalhacker.us@outlook.com) or Whatsapp No... +13212372438 contact him now if you are ready.

4816,"**Caveats:**

* The sample size is small
* The polling period is long (10 days), making trends possibly more difficult to detect.
* Ireland uses STV, not a list system. The Greens probably  wouldn‚Äôt  physically  be able to run half as many candidates as would be necessary to ensure that everyone who wants to vote Green can do so. Realistically, the Greens would only get 6% to 8% of the vote if an actual election were held.

**Remarks:** 

FG‚Äôs problems with housing; public transport; climate change; high cost of insurance; wasting huge sums of taxpayers money; being entitled, snobbish, and arrogant; and poor public services have caught  up with them. 

Leo Varadkar‚Äôs honeymoon period is truly over, and people are starting to look elsewhere. In some ways, he has a similar habit of chasing after rightwing causes as the DUP. 

Up until this point, FG have been able to use spin, propaganda, and Leo‚Äôs youth to make the party look less rightwing than it actually is, but people are getting sick of no progress on the country‚Äôs problems. 

FG also had no serious competition because FF and the Greens were utterly  toxic as a result of the 2010 banking crisis. 

Since May‚Äôs elections, both parties have been sufficiently rehabilitated that FG are now suddenly facing serious competition ithe centre to centre-right. They are completely unprepared.

As a result, the centre to centre-right vote has been going to FF and the Green Party seemingly out of nowhere because dissatisfied FG voters have somewhere to go.",,/r/europe/comments/c2btez/irish_opinion_poll_11062019_ruling_fg_party/erj4h67/,Candid_Cryptographer,1560915444

4822,"&gt;This was all a relentless strategy of arming Christians against Muslims. Why can't you see this?

It's because history of genocides became rather politicized. I remember being downvoted to -60 for merely explaining the Ottoman view of reason of deportations. It's because Christians rebelled, and Ottomans didn't want to see an another Balkans happening in Anatolia. Whether you agree with this view or not, this was their reason. It's not because they hated Armenians so much and they wanted to create a pure Turkic race. 

Discussing these genocides has become impossible without getting brigaded or having a brigade with you on Reddit. Though I rather find it interesting that there are comparisons to Holocaust. Jewish historians like Bernard Lewis absolutely deny any comparison of Armenian genocide to Holocaust for example because it happened under different circumstances and in a different environment and using different methods (according to him). 

The reason for this genocide becoming politicized could also be explained by current sentiment against Turkey by the West. The West has always more or less disliked Turkey and Turks but in the last years they started to openly hate Turkey. They usually hide behind the fact that they're merely criticizing our government (their German comedian used racial slurs against Erdogan on a TV show though. It's like calling Obama the N word and saying that you're just criticizing him.). But in my opinion they're just using the Turkish government as a cloak to hide their real hatred towards Turks. Like how anti semites use anti zionism as their cloak. 

By the way, I'd like to thank you for these posts. I find it rather sad that there's bad blood between our nations these days.

House prices, including purchases of both new and existing houses and flats, have fluctuated significantly since 2006 with annual growth rates in the EU of around 8% in 2006 and 2007, followed by a fall of 4% in 2009 as a result of the financial crisis. Prices started growing again in 2014.

Overall, between 2010 and 2018, house prices grew in total by 15% in the EU and by 11% in the euro area. Among the Member States, the highest increases during this period were observed in Estonia (+83%), Latvia (+61%), Austria (+56 %), Sweden (+55%) and Luxembourg (+50%), and the largest decreases in Italy (-17%), Spain (-12%) and Cyprus (-8%).",Romania,/r/europe/comments/c2ceku/house_prices_up_by_15_in_the_eu_since_2010/erj78ct/,filosoful,1560917900

There's a third possibility, though: Iran's Revolutionary Guards, which together with other [Principlist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Principlists) groups are firmly opposed to the nuclear deal which Rouhani's Reformist government had agreed to in 2015.

4947,"It is a special case and has nothing to do with the rules of leaving.

The only thing keeping Greece from going bankrupt is the EU money paying for our loans, by loaning us more. If we leave then we become worse than Venezuela.

Now there is a trick in the loan papers. We can‚Äôt go bankrupt while in the EU because it would hurt the economies of the other euro countries. Also we can‚Äôt go bankrupt outside the EU because the papers we signed to get the first loan, state that everything owned by the government will be handed to our creditors and ‚Äúwe forfeit all rights to prevent this‚Äù. (more than half the country is owned by the government).

It is not a secret that every politician that campaigned in the last 10 years and won an election promised to get us out of Europe. We even held a referendum and grexit won. However EU threatened to bankrupt us if we leave. They shut down our banks and humiliated us for many months. We even elected the communist party to rule our country. (Communism in 2019 lol)

German officials are portrayed in newspapers and internet sites as nazi occupiers all the time and there is petition signed by the government, asking from Germany to repay Greece for all the loans we gave them during and after ww2.

4948,"&gt; With him at the helm

You could literally have said the same thing about Winston Churchill in 1936.

Now I'm not saying Iran is Nazi Germany, nor that Bolton is Winston Churchill, but just because Bolton has been a consistent advocate of action against Iran doesn't make him wrong, no more than Churchill was wrong about Germany.

And before you ask - I think that Iran is less evil than Germany, and less of an immediate threat to peace, but more of a threat in geopolitical terms.  Iranian control of the Gulf would severely upset the world balance of power, destabilizing the global order.  Iran could not project force, but by dominating the region and being able to control the flow of oil, if it allied with Russia or China, that would severely weaken the West.  The EU couldn't count on safe oil shipments, and would be pried away from the American sphere.  The EU would become an even lesser force in global affairs, being hostage to Russia-Iran for energy needs, and the US would be isolated.

Zi¬∑on¬∑ism

/Ààzƒ´…ôÀåniz…ôm/

ÔøºLearn to pronounce

noun

a movement for (originally) the re-establishment and (now) the development and protection of a Jewish nation in what is now Israel. It was established as a political organization in 1897 under Theodor Herzl, and was later led by Chaim Weizmann.


Secularism

Secularism, as defined in the Merriam-Webster dictionary,[1]¬†is the ""indifference to, or rejection or exclusion of, religion and religious considerations."" In different contexts the word can refer to anticlericalism, atheism, desire to exclude religion from social activities or civic affairs, banishment of religious symbols from the public sphere, state neutrality toward religion, the separation of religion from state, or¬†disestablishment¬†(separation of church and state).[2][3][4]

Theocracy¬†is defined by the Webster's Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language as ""a form of government in which God or a deity is recognized as the supreme civil ruler. His laws being interpreted by the ecclesiastical authorities.""

It's absolutely implicit in your statements that you think the EU has a major role to play here.  It doesn't.  Iran's relationship with the EU is collateral damage.

The US is 100% central to this, as are Iran and Saudi Arabia.  Everybody else is secondary or a bystandard.

The US is central because: America guarantees world trade in general, and more specifically, it's committed (not just by treaty but by national self-interest) to free flow of oil through the Persian Gulf.  To these ends, the US allies with Saudi Arabia, guaranteeing the regime there and overlooking its abuses, in order to counterbalance Iran.

Saudi Arabia is central because Saudi Arabia is the main exporter of oil.  Most of its oil-bearing regions have heavily Shia populations, and it has been in a religious and geopolitical conflict with Iran since the fall of the Shah.  Iran can threaten Saudi Arabia, and Iran can shut down KSA's oil exports.

To antagonize the US into reacting heavy heavy handedly, but well below a war Iran isn't insane, so that Russia and especially China might feel more free to continue doing serious business with Iran and if they're really lucky get the EU to be more serious about circumventing US sanctions too. Not a great plan but they have nothing else since the US isn't giving in and the others don't see Iran as worth getting into a pissing match with the US over.

5007,"&gt;Last Tuesday the **summer melt season** began in the central part of the Arctic Ocean, when the average temperature north of 80 degrees latitude came above the melting point. This is 1 week later than the average start date and 2 weeks later than in 2012 where the sea ice extent reached an all time low in September.  
&gt;  
&gt;""The later start date this year increases the likelihood that more of the Arctic sea ice will survive the approximately 3 month long melt season,"" Rasmus Tonboe from the DMI Centre for Ocean and Ice explains.  
&gt;  
&gt;""Right now the curve of ice extent in the Arctic is following last years curve. In 2013 the melt onset also came a week later than usual, and 2013 ended with significantly more ice in September than in the record year 2012"".

5093,"&gt;What would be best for everyone, for starters, would be for everyone to be one people.

I mean.. OK. But we are one people in a sense that we are all humans, on this planet. We do however have political and other divisions. Are they a bad thing? Should everyone have the same laws, the same approaches to problems, the same styles of government? I'm not sure I'd like the outcome of that very much given it'd likely be rather different to the kind of liberal, progressive, democratic and accountable society that believes in the rule of law that I'd prefer..  And that's what borders are aren't they? Lines that mark different approaches to governance.

I think countries should work together, especially on solving issues that impact across borders, but I don't think they need to be in deep political unions to achieve that. Indeed I think that's how you end up with unrepresentative and disconnected governments. In the long term that means less stability, more fracturing, and likely poorer outcomes.

&gt;Leaving one of the largest social, political and economic blocs to become almost entirely isolated overnight,

Leaving the EU isn't about isolation, nor does it deliver it though. I mean, it's leaving a regional political block, one that is arguably quite introverted at the best of times, and in some quarters seems to be almost more about rebuilding a European imperial past than anything else, the EU as a rival to the US and China. The UK won't be anything like isolated 'overnight' or over any period either, indeed the UK will remain one of the most connected, most outgoing countries in the world..

There will be issues with trade though, you'd be right there, it will take time to rebuild trading frameworks in a way that makes sense, but then that's the cost of leaving a regional block, and in the long term I think will be more than worth it.

&gt;on behalf of half a country riled up by xenophobia and misinformation, 

Do you really think that half the country is riled up by xenophobia? The analysis of why people voted leave doesn't show that, the studies about attitudes in the UK don't show that (and if you think they do, then what does that say about the rest of the world given the UK is very much not xenophobic in relative terms..).  I don't know about you, but that isn't my experience, nor does it reflect the data available, so how have you come to 'feel' that this is about xenophobia?

You might have a point about misinformation, there is certainly enough of it floating about, but you also seemed earlier to accept that it might also be about people having rather different outlooks and priorities. So is misinformation a driver, or are we blowing the issues with the campaigning out of all proportion and ignoring real (and long term given 4 decades of polling..) dissatisfaction with the EU as a political project?

&gt;is the wrong decision.

No, leaving is almost certainly the right direction for the UK, there is a lack for consent to what the EU is now and quite a lot of problems with its direction. There is a lack of popular input (some of that the fault of our own governments) and a lack of real accountability. That clearly isn't working for the UK and it is best that the UK is out of the EU, and acts as a solid partner..",United Kingdom - Personally vouched for by /u/colourfox,/r/europe/comments/c20y6p/the_price_uk_conservative_members_will_pay_to_get/erin1si/,-ah,1560901929

Besides, even if they somehow didn't realize that the President isn't the one who ratifies treaties, what did they think was going to happen when he left office? Obama isn't our god-king; if he could unilaterally make a deal, logic stands to reason that the next President could also unilaterally make or change deals as well. So even to someone who has no understanding of the treating making process at all, it should be obvious that the deal was fraught to start with. If the President isn't allowed to make a binding treaty on his own, they should have waited for the Senate. And if the President were able to do it alone, that also means the President could undo it alone too. 

The fact of the matter is that Europe, Iran, and the Obama administration decided to try and do an end-run around the Senate and figured they'd be able to get away with it because Clinton was probably willing to toe the line. And then when she lost, they got bit in the ass.

Although it's best practise to look up a word in the *Duden* (which is the accepted standard dictionary in German), it's by no means required to do so since German is 'grammar language', not a 'dictionary language'. Which, if you think about it, gives German speakers an awesome degree of freedom. (Sadly, most of them don't seem to be aware of that fact, let alone use it, as Kant, Hegel, Schiller and Goethe did, for example. The main contribution of those people to the German language is that they knew how to wield these powerful tools to match the language to their own creativity.)

As far as the grammar itself is concerned, there is no technical upper limit as to how long words can get. There are only rules how to construct them -- but be warned, they're quite extensive ([scientific source in German](https://grammis.ids-mannheim.de/systematische-grammatik/909)).

And for this reason, I received an instruction to ask you, in the spirit of friendship - not in the spirit of confrontation - regarding your intentions.

When you aren't ripping parts of the conversation out of context, it's very clear that she's not giving a green light for an invasion of Kuwait, and is in fact doing the opposite- she's expressing concern over Saddam's intentions to do so.

The narrative that America deliberately tricked Saddam into invading Kuwait is pure conspiracy nonsense. It's entirely based on this single exchange from Ambassador Glaspie which itself is not very strong evidence. 

As for the Nayirah testimony, while that particular report was fake,  Iraq was definitely guilty of atrocities in Kuwait, that's a historical fact. The testimony was also *never* the central justification for the conflict. The central justification was always about ensuring a stable Mid East by rolling back Saddam's military conquest and restoring Kuwaiti sovereignty.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/c23res/germany_says_there_is_strong_evidence_iran_behind/eri0880/,jogarz,1560886696

Chinese will dominate nearby states, but will not reach Europe, South/North America, Middle East, Indian subcontinent and Africa.

You will therefore not see Norwegian speakers use Chinese with Russians, Japanese, Koreans, Brazilians, or Nigerians. They will use English, alas, lingua franca.

5341,"There was no ""Spanish people"" before the begining of the various Islamic ruled realms of medieval Iberia. 

There was a set of kingdoms of hispaniromans ruled by a Germanic (Visigothic) minority that were in the middle of a civil war. The locals reacted differently to switching their visigothic overlords with Caliphs, some resisted but most were actually ok with it.

Here is a quote:

After Roderic's defeat, the Umayyad governor of¬†Ifrikiya¬†Musa ibn-Nusayr¬†joined Tariq, directing a campaign against different towns and strongholds in Iberia. **Some, like Merida, Cordova, or¬†Zaragoza¬†in 712, probably¬†Toledo, were taken by storm or after resistance, but many agreed to a treaty in exchange for maintaining autonomy, in¬†Theodemir's dominion (region of Tudmir), or¬†Pamplona, for example.[24]¬†The invading Islamic armies did not exceed 60,000 men.[25]**

Most of this people became muslim with time, that gave the bulk of the population in islamic iberian kingdoms: The Mulad√≠es. Those that did not convert were Christians called Mozarabs and did indeed pay a special tax, but were excempt of other taxs just for muslims (Zakat). This peoples status varied a lot with time, sometimes they were indeed second class citizens and even persecuted ( bits of the almoravid and almohad periods), but most of the time they were full citizens that enjoyed the same rights and freedoms as others (and very often had important positions in the government).",,/r/europe/comments/c2422g/a_city_councilor_of_vox_removes_a_bust_of/erhnzyw/,Tavirio,1560879172

""Death to the US and Israel"" isn't their actual political agenda, it is directed at their own people. Keep them angry at outer enemies so that they don't get angry at you for your terrible internal politics and economy. If you can convince the people that you are powerful enough to take up the world's/the regions largest power they are not likely to try to get rid of you. 

Khamenei probably looked at Saddam and Gaddafi, and what happened to them after they gave up on their chemical or nuclear weapon programs. Ending up like the North Korean leadership looks much more appealing right now.

The attack is probably again a show of force. The US sends aircraft carriers, Iran shows of their power to disrupt the world's oil supply. I'm actually a bit surprised that they didn't have one of their foreign militias do the dirty work. 

Nothing of this is in the interest of the average Iranian, so it wouldn't be rational for a leadership who tries to make things better for their people. But if you look at it from the leadership's perspective and their own interest of staying alive and in power, it is rational in a fucked-up way.

It wasn't really Americas response. It was the natural response of neighboring countries that have been occupied by Soviet Union/Russia for decades. The response was simply to get the fuck away from Russia's claws us fast as possible, using every mechanism available in Europe, from joining the EU to joining NATO, to protect themselves from another occupation and new wave of atrocities.  

For the last 26 years Ukraine's political elite corrupted by Russia's money were hesitant to settle on their course for Ukraine, and for their inaction the whole country had to pay a big price, and learn a hard way, who is their real friend and who is their enemy, when their territories were occupied and annexed by Russia.

On top of that the foreigner toll is limited to using Autobahn. The foreigner doesn't have to pay toll if he doesn't use the Autobahn.

A better solution would have been a european union fund for international infrastructure to help pay for repairs on high traffic transit infrastructure such as the autobahn.

Sure I can see that it's a pain to have to pay toll for a country you're just passing through but in return, that guarantees you properly maintained roads that are safe to travel on.

Due to the mountainous geography of Austria you almost have to cross into Germany to get, e.g., from Salzburg into the Tyrol, but you'll quickly notice that once you cross the border you have these poorly maintained two-lane ""highways"" that don't even have road guard rails at points and that kinda say ""we don't really care about these roads because it's mainly Austrians that use them"".

The countries they are coming from are either already bursting to the brims with refugees (much more than the allegedly poor little Europe or the US, e.g. tens of millions collectively at MENA countries) or they are deemed unsafe (Libya ungoverned/in anarchy).

And even if these two things aren't true, the other countries of the world have every right to simply say ""no"" to the entitled western demand of them being dumping grounds, being asked to imprison refugees, contrary to their freedom of moving on and seeking asylum wherever they please.

&gt;Fact is that the refugees the human rights act originally envisioned are nothing like the refugees of today. It is outdated and need ti be re examined to keep up with the times.

Fact is the completely opposite, the ""human rights act"", aka the 1951 Refugee Convention and it's 1967 Protocol, envisioned that people would react demanding the refugees to be kept out, and that's why they made the Convention this way, obligatory.

That's not how it works, &lt;newspeak&gt;""reexamining""&lt;/newspeak&gt;, aka changing the system in favor of the wealthier unwilling to carry the share of their burden proportional to their financial capabilities, the result being shafting every other less capable country in the world with an even bigger burden they can't handle.

But when the cookies are large, you first say it's a ""large cookie"", which is a unit inside the sentence in and of itself; it becomes its own noun as it were. By saying we're making it a single noun we're deciding that ""large"" from now on says something about the cookie, no questions asked.

Now we're adding the thief portion, and just like clotheshanger and cardoor, the two nouns together just become one word: ""largecookiethief"", where ""*thief* of *large cookies*"" is analagous to ""hanger of clothes"" and ""door of car"".
