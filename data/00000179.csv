Then you use that to justify persecuting religious people. 

Why should the government be involved with validating your children‚Äôs sexuality? I mean the age of consent for sex is 18, meaning legally a person is judged incapable of making appropriate sexual decisions until then. Why is it then appropriate to teach children from 4-11 about sexuality? That‚Äôs a huge discrepancy.

1. Take a look at the responsibilities of MPs:

&gt;The first duty of a member of Parliament is to do what he thinks in his faithful and disinterested judgement is right and necessary for the honour and safety of Great Britain. His second duty is to his constituents, of whom he is the representative but not the delegate. 

Both duties give the MPs more than enough rights to vote for an extension. It can be seen as necessary because the parliament is gridlocked and unable to make any decision on the terms of the Brexit. And the MPs can easily say that they follow the interest of their specific constituents.

2. Even when they would violate their responsibilities as MPs with such a vote they still wouldn't be ""traitors"". This is not a war. They are not giving information to an enemy. This is the completely wrong term for it.

You view the world through a lens as if it is the early 20th century, where wars are declared on one another in a nice clean manner. The world today is different. We are globalizing at a fast place and warfare is no longer conventional, so we need unconventional ways to conduct it.

I don‚Äôt disagree with US being involved in the Middle East or anywhere for that matter. I just believe it‚Äôs strategy was flawed and short sighted. I am pro-intervention,  but pro-cost effective intervention.

Examples of recent interventions that I support are: 

Persian Gulf War 1 (very impressive)
Yugoslavia(also pretty good)

Examples of interventions I wish took place:

Rwanda
Syria (I‚Äôll never forgive Obama for not intervening)

I do care about the troops and all people. I just disagree with simplistic feel good chants like ‚Äúbring the troops home NOW‚Äù. The people that support these things generally do not care for US standing in the world, and have no long term vision beyond their own lifetimes.

As far as your reference to a failed hegemony, IMO you are completely wrong. USA, despite its isolationist public, has hastened the trajectory towards one word government and that is a good thing. The intention was never to have USA be ruler of the world,  but to move away from nationalism towards continentalism (like the EU, [UNASUR](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_of_South_American_Nations) , ASEAN, and eventually North America Union) and eventually full globalism where all nations are under one government 

I am relatively confident this will happen one day.

56,"&gt;Nice goalpost shifting. First you claim it's different because they're culturally similar, but once I show otherwise you turn around and claim that just proves you right.

Nah mate I said the EU will fail because all former Empires that tried to unite European countries ( Rome, Saint Roman Germanic Empire, Napoleon, Nazi Germany...) failed as they just cannot be integrated into ONE Empire because of cultural differences, you started talking about the UK, which is different as they all talk the same language and have the same currency. They have internal problems but is it our concern ? I don't think so. 
&gt;beside the free trade zone, you mean (that makes the EU the UK's biggest trade partner, as well as France

A country does not need to be into the EU and to adopt the Euro to trade with it, like Switerland and the 350ish other countries in the world. France for example as about 3000 treaties beside the EU.

&gt;Besides providing funds for member countries (including the UK and France) to further develop?

That is unfortunately one of the biggest misconception about the EU, people that don't know just think the EU is giving money out of pure generosity to countries to develop, LOL , where do you think the money comes from ? A magic hat ?
In 2016 France contributed ‚Ç¨19.48 billion to the EU budget and got back ‚Ç¨11.274 billion so France LOST about 8 billion in 2016. Here, this is reality facts, not some bullshit propaganda from the TV. Basically I ask you for 1000euros, I give you back 600e but you cannot spend them as you want, I decide. AND you should thanks me for it. Sure it's a great deal right ? I accept Bitcoins btw.

&gt;Besides promoting European co-operation, intertwining its members' fates to avoid catastrophes like the 1940's? Besides forming one cohesive bloc with major bargaining power to rival other foreign powers like the US and China?

If EU was about ""being Stronger Together"" then can someone explain why the commission refused the fusion of Alstom and Siemens to become an European giant against the Chinese train company ?
Why the USA would be in favor of the EU if it is to be more competitive against themselves? It makes no sense.
Look at when the USA (NATO) forced us towards illegal war in Syria, all for geopolitical gains against Russia, Europe is not ""peace"".

&gt;Besides putting pressure on the Eastern European countries to adopt proper human rights stances? Yeah right we are the example to follow about human rights, we were not the people invading the whole world and applying slavery, we are not the ones that are in business with Saudi Arabia and China at all. Nop, we are good. Them are bad.

&gt;To adopt a fair Justice system, separated from the Executive branch?
I'm laughing hard in French, especially after what happen recently with Benalla and the French ""riot cop boxer"" guy. The justice system in fucked in France, and I don't think this has anything to do with the EU anyway.

&gt;Besides the freedom of movement? Have you never been to Switzerland ? Turkey ? Any other countries outside the EU are BLOCKED for you to go and live in ?  Come on Im a traveller for like 10 years and the only difference is about visa and passport controls, which is not so bad and we could still have an easy way for people to move across borders without having to sell out the whole country to foreign investors.

&gt;The freedom for the citizen to live their lives where they so choose? I live in Australia, which is not in the EU. Am I for real ?

&gt;Now you tell me how NOT being in the EU outweighs the positives of being in it. I'm very curious. 

I hope you ll be able to answer to all those points as well because everything you just said is what I heard 1000 times from people that just repeat what they heard since they are kids.

&gt;So this is the level of maturity I'm dealing with. Good to know.

Though some did see him as a traitor for failing to crown Otto von Habsburg, it's worth noting that many of Hungary's neighbors were not going to tolerate a new Hungarian kingdom, lest they push their ancestral claims.

He actually managed to (diplomatically) get back a fair bit of land, mostly land with a Hungarian majority, which was definitely supported by the people. Unfortunately I don't know how the acquired minorities were treated, but my gut feeling is mostly left alone.

While he aligned with the Germans, not a single Hungarian Jew was deported during his time, and he was replaced by the Germans when he refused to join the war.

The outrage mobs usually only affect moderates and left leaning politicans(by objective standard CDU is leftist even if in Germany it's a right wing party). 

Different socio-economic classes and political leanings have different expectations.

Blue collar workers will cheer if someone in politics uses swear words because ""hes just like us one of the people""

The middle classses and up will go ""thats not acceptable the politician should be dignified""

The fact is there no objective answers on how they should act in public, just opinions. 

There also a big factor in the end justifies the means, a lot of europeans and americans for example think illegal immigration is bad. It's literally illegal by law. They think this is a very important issue yet most left leaning governments won't come out and say that it's literally bad because someone will come out and call them racist or intolerant or other words that will lose you some left leaning votes.

That happened in Europe's sphere of influence and they don't appear to be the slightest bit upset. You can't argue that this is a threat when Europe hasn't responded. Where is all the new defense spending, the new soldiers, the targeted war games, or the stepped up training? They've nothing to indicate they are concerned and if they don't care then I don't see why we should care.


&gt; But if the situation was truly drastic and the USA requested assistance, I am confident assistance would come(as long as Europe doesn‚Äôt completely hate us by then for our current president constantly berating and spitting on them).


After Ukraine/Crimea, Pew asked in the 2015 Global Attitudes Survey if [your] country should or should not use military force to defend a NATO ally. Basically, Pew surveyed support for Article 5. ""The strongest opposition to responding with armed force is in Germany (58%), followed by France (53%) and Italy (51%).""

The legality of the intervention in Yugoslavia is debatable. In addition to that, legality is not a necessary precondition IMO to prevent ethnic cleansing.

I remember as a five or six year old having only hte vaguest idea of what homosexuality was, including beliving that there must be some mechanism for a man getting pregnant. I also remember that I and my peers used ""gay"" as an insult into puberty...although in that case I believe that stopping had less to do with out age than attitudes changing across society. We had super basic sex-ed in primary school (age 8 perhaps?), it was maybe a handful of lessons and almost entirely focused on how sex and babies function in the most basic way (what is a condom and what they are good for), there was also a focus on what is not good - abuse, I figure that latter served as a way to teach kids recognizing what is not okay and perhaps also as a way to spot kids in the class which might have been subject to abuse.

I think spending perhaps 30-60 minutes or so discussing LGBT stuff so that the kids have a basic understanding of the subject matter does not do any ill.

212,"&gt;   The only reason DC exists is because we viewed it as essential that no state control the capital.

Right, and that became an article of the constitution. So the precise question is whether that article outweighs the foundational principle to equal representation. 

I don‚Äôt think the size of DC matters much, by population DC it still beats Vermont and Wyoming. The ‚Äòmove 10 miles‚Äô argument is not strong either. By that rationale any sufficiently small county could put up signs ‚Äòno negroes‚Äô as long as the neigboring county doesn‚Äôt. 

Equal representation is a fundamental issue. 

It‚Äôs a human right (plz ratify) and the very reason for the US‚Äôs existence. Also it‚Äôs closely related to the first amendment (you could argue the situation inhibits people of DC to petition the government).

I haven‚Äôt dived in the official reasoning for wanting government to not be in a state, but I can‚Äôt think of any solid reason except it being a compromise to get states to agree to the federal union, borne out of mutual mistrust and the balance of military power between states and country. Today there is no risk of states occupying, attacking or blocking the capitol or white house. Also there are many essential federal institutions within states‚Äô borders (pentagon, military bases, federal agencies and courts). They don‚Äôt pose serious jurisdictional problems or conflicts at all. The federal government has more than enough legislative and physical power to protect those from rebellions.

Congress also cannot unilaterally decide to re-attach DC to Maryland. DC residents would need to vote on it. And maybe Maryland too (not entirely sure, the admission rules forbid partition without state consent, but I can‚Äôt find anything on mergers or annexation/allocation).

I wonder what the options would be if SCOTUS ruled the situation unconstitutional. Because SCOTUS does not have the power to order an extra state into existence. It could force a federal tax exemption though, and that would probably get congress looking for a solution. I know SCOTNL can summon government to legislate its way out of a constitutional infraction, but I‚Äôm not sure how that works in the US. 

It‚Äôs all pretty much an academic discussion though. The American judiciary branch is pretty much under political control, so I doubt the supreme court would even take such a case.  
If they did, and especially if they did rule the DC situation to be unconstitutional, it could set a precedent for SCOTUS to outlaw things like gerrymandering, electoral college, FPTP, etc. ",Nederland,/r/europe/comments/b11qbu/brexit_crunch_week_day_3_to_delay_or_not_to_delay/eijv1hk/,breathing_normally,1552607770

278,"&gt; But after the GE, what could be done differently?

Announcing the inability to carry out Brexit with a minority government. Not engaging in this abomination of a government with the DUP.

&gt; The EU wouldn't negotiate before A50 was triggered.

Of course they wouldn't. The point was that the UK figure out what they wanted before triggering A50, if anything current affairs prove exactly why the EU negotiating prior to A50 would be a complete waste of time, as it has been a waste of time now.

&gt; Perhaps that is a failing too, but since we're trying to be realistic, it is clear that there never was going to be a super-majority opinion on this so they had to make compromises within their own policy, which hasn't completely worked.

The biggest issue with UK politics, to me, is that it forces a two party system and those two parties are both abominations, forcing a dysfunctional coalition within the party itself between ideas that cannot sensibly go alongside one another, all to be able to achieve a big enough number to matter in parliament. This is the system itself being broken though, which is a bit of a tangent from what parliament could have done better in terms of managing Brexit.

&gt; But I asked what they could do differently after the GE, where that and A50 trigger has already happened.

Well, I hope my first point answers that adequately, but it bears repeating; Postpone Brexit until such a time where there is a government that can reasonably carry it out. Brexit died in the 2017 GE, it's corpse has been dragged around since, and parliament has been entirely complicit in this farce. Not doing any of that would already be a huge improvement.

280,"&gt; Haha great, I‚Äôm anti-health, anti-vax, let me guess, racist, transphobic and homophobic too??

No, I'm saying you are being naive about the capabilities of everyone being able to give a good education to their kids about health, and this includes sexuality. 

&gt; Tell me, at what point do parents get to choose what their children learn? 

In a public education setting? Never, I don't want a parent to decide what type of math is good enough for their kids, unless said parents have a degree in education or any sort of similar field, the opinion of a random parent about how the public education system should work is absolutely meaningless, it's their job AS parents to stay informed and learn as well. If they want to decide how their kid can be educated than he can be home schooled, and grow up to be their perfect little fucked up human being.

&gt; What would you say if the shoe was on the other foot and all children had to be religiously indoctrinated under threat of fine..

Thankfully most of us live in secular societies that realize that religion shouldn't have a place in a child's formal education, because unlike religion, most education is done based on years of research on what's best for a child, instead of whatever the fuck their little fantasy book tells them. 

&gt; Btw, I think sex-ed is important, but I didn‚Äôt start learning about it until middle school. And even then, it was very straightforward and based around the biology of reproduction/sexual function of genitalia.

See, it's nice to see that you, me and the people being the programme agree, given that all [the kids learn before middle school is that some kids like different stuff, and some people have 2 moms instead of 1 mom and 1 dad.](https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/ax8gmw/birmingham_school_stops_lgbt_lessons_after/ehsg48p/)

&gt;  No politics, no ideology and certainly no controversy.

One of the advantages of EU is that once those countries became EU states they became more secular and democratic. So in that regard Turkey would be in a better position if it was a member already. 

I know that Turkey is in a very shitty place at the moment but even if we weren‚Äôt i personally believe that we would never be a member state. If EU was accepting against Turkey, Turkey would be a member state long before Erdogan was a leader.

You are nothing but a number to them, and that is already as clear as the day when you use their dreadful customer service. 

I've heard suggestions of getting rid of cash alltogether before, under the umbrella of 'preventing crime' and what other shit, but all it does in practice is hurt law abiding citizens by making day-to-day life more difficult, make negative interest rates in banks entirely possible to force consumers to spend their money on garbage that they dont need, and once more decrease the pricacy of your average Joe by making a digital trail out of everything. 

I dont remember exactly how many times I've had problems with my debit card, or the whatever visa system not working in the stores so they dont accept plastic temporarily, but its alot, yet not one single time in my life have I had problems with using cash. I could lose my wallet and all the plastic with it on a friday night and be fucked until I get them replaced next week, if it wasnt for the cash that I have. Other problem with it is that cash on your bank account is only theoretical and it can be erased by accident or purpose with one click of a button. It works for the most part, if the people responsible for that button click are trustworthy. Its also pretty well established that you spend more money when using cards, which is why businesses prefer them over cash aswell.

I agree. But that's off topic. The upload-filters discussed here are supposed to identify works, not files. I.e. if you convert a picture from jpg to png, it should still be recognised. This implies fuzzy picture- and sound-recognition. The filter needs to be able to detect similar enough works while recognizing if the existing differences make it a parody or are extensive enough to make it a new work.

&gt; Here's an idea. Hashes are assigned to content uploads. When a copyright holder rightfully asks for a piece of content to be removed and re-uploads to be blocked, the site hashes the content the copyright holder uploaded for reference and queries its database for matches. Matches are marked for removal. Users can challenge them via arbitration. The new law mandates proper arbitration processes so that false positives can be identified and fixed.

The proposed 'filters', and really they are no more 'filters' than a ""this username is already taken"" dialogue is a 'filter', only require you to prevent future upload of _specific works_.

706,"&gt; The distinction between exempted parody and quotations, and copymonopoly violations.

You don't need to check if a specific re-upload is a parody because by definition a parody is a legal type of adaptation. Computers are perfectly capable of checking whether two files are identical. There is no possibility when two files are identical, one is a parody and one is not. 

&gt; How the hell is that not a filter?

You could call it a filter, but you cannot associate it with either ContentID or the filters that used to be proposed by the member states. The current proposal does not have any requirements that would require you to employ content recognition technologies, nor does it require platforms to block derivative works (which indeed would be indistinguishable from parody). 

Equally, you would have to argue that ""this username is already taken"" is a username filter. That's now how we usually use the word filter.

&gt; If that's the case then requirement is entirely ineffective, since changing a single pixel, letter, or sound oscillation will be enough to be different. It might as well be scrapped then.

Maybe actually read the directive. Recital 38b literally agrees with you that for some types of content the requirements will be easy to circumvent and thus it's reasonable to only be able to take down those violations when right holders report them again. 

&gt; No, if you read the article then you'll see it's a well-documented piece that uses all available sources.

&gt; It's clear that you didn't read the article I linked. It also includes meetings of parliamentary fractions.

&gt; I don't. Read the article. It's very detailed.

It literally only has numbers about Commission lobbying. 

&gt; That, too, is discussed in the article: ""That same week, immediately before the JURI committee vote, the UK Music Industry body published a press release stating that ‚Äúfigures show Google‚Äôs ‚Ç¨31m EU lobbying bid‚Äù on copyright. UK Music simply took the entire lobby budget declared by Google in 2017, ‚Ç¨6 million, and added to that the budgets of all the organisations and think tanks it is a member of, declaring that the ‚ÄúThe combined value of Google‚Äôs indirect lobbying of the EU amounts to ‚Ç¨25.5m‚Äù.

And the article leaves out that Google also sent staff themselves to the Parliament to lobby, which we do not know how much it cost. They lobbied _themselves_, _directly_ and _untransparently_.

What it also conveniently leaves out is that Google likely spent tens of millions of lobbying elsewhere - an amount that literally is impossible to figure out because it's not required to be done in transparency. 

&gt; You're parroting the press releases of the music industry, and you still think you're going against the lobbying of the big lobbying groups.

The issue is that while no-deal and May's deal lack majority support, they are both better supported by some margin than unilateral revocation. So it's not about ignoring that, it's essentially realising that it's not really on the table. We'll see what happens with the extension vote later, but simply voting against exit methods, while not having close to enough support to prevent an exit, all while leaving with no-deal remains the default isn't a great look for the UK..

1. German companies will just move to other member states where there is no such requirement. Because of the Digital Single Market, Germany cannot enforce its requirement in other EU countries, nor can it prevent its users from using those services. This means Germany would be committing economic suicide. 
2. If those requirements result in takedowns of legitimate works, which it likely would, the CJEU would strike down the implementation as unlawful.

The matter of the specific percentages for leave and remain in England and Scotland and the rest of the UK is only relevant to our discussion in respect to determining whether Scotland voted 'overwhelmingly' for remain, which I argue they haven't when considering the large minority of 38% who voted to leave. You can believe otherwise, it really doesn't matter.

As you say 46.6% of voters in England voted to remain, but I never suggested that England voted or the UK voted for that matter *overwhelmingly* for Brexit. Thus the matter you're trying to discuss in the first part of your comment is irrelevant.

---------------------
Your second part also seems to stem from some sort of confusion. Let me paraphrase and clarify what I've said in these last few comments.

The Irish border is the only issue of contention in the UK-EU negotiations preventing a smooth Brexit.

830,"That's just a poor understanding of what's going on

&gt; It is EU fault. Their deal is effectively stay in EU and have no voting power. Britain just wanted reasonable trade deal much like EU signed such treaty with japan lately.

That can still happen (though it's not what UK want, it would still cause problems in Northern Ireland). The trade deal happens after the withdrawal agreement and could have started negotiations already if the UK could agree among themselves what exactly they were withdrawing from and how it would work.

&gt; The only problem of the brexit is with Northern Ireland border
&gt; 
&gt; No it is not. Ireland issue is just small problem that can be resolved entirely on UK side by just giving ok for any irish to get to uk and treat everyone else like illegal immigrant. They could set up border too and check papers which is not huge issue in case of migrant crisis or something like that.

That wouldn't solve the issue. It doesn't fix the problem of goods crossing the border. 

They cannot set up a border, they do not want to, it's breaks an international treaty lodged with the UN and would potentially kick off more conflict in the north.

832,"&gt; It is not misleading. As I said, poverty and despair breeds extremism and it doesn't matter where this comes from ‚Äì a World War can have a similarly devastating effect as a financial &amp; economic crisis.
&gt; 
&gt; The Inter-War period in Europe is characterized by the consequences of World War 1 as well as the economical crisis and both lead to most European states becoming right-wing authoritarian dictatorships. 

You used that map to counter my statement, that economical problem were happening from 1929 on everywhere, because it was one of the biggest world economic crisis in entire history, without regularly leading to the kind of change in Government like in Germany. Your map shows countries that were almost completely already no longer democratic before this crisis was happening. In that regard it is misleading.

This means your map does not support the general sentiment that more then a small part of the population - only around 5-10% in the example of Germany - would turn to extremism, in cause of poverty alone, because the world economic crisis did almost solely in Germany lead to this result. 

&gt; Bolshevism and Capitalism by the Nazis (as absurd as that is), but one of those stereotypes became infinitely more useful in the times of the economic crisis.

&gt; I think you are overestimating how much people knew about this topic and underestimating how powerful the stereotypes against Jews were. Yes, WE long know that the stereotypes were bullshit ‚Äì but people back then really believed this bullshit about the Jewish world conspiracy. 

And i think that Hitler was mostly agitating against international ""Finanzjuden"" and Bolsheviks, because of the fact that in Germany the People did not feel any of the threat normal Jews are posing. Its the same when Orban is agitating his people against Soros or Erdogan against G√ºlen. All are some strange external powers that are somehow behind almost every problem in the country. This mysterious enemy can't just be the neighbour next door.  Because not only do you know him, but also: when he is gone, you'd lose your Boogeyman.

&gt; I mean no disrespect to your great-grandfather ‚Äì but you can not take his story to generalize. That is not how historical research works.

I'm pretty sure my grandfather was able to distinct between his small perspective and the general atmosphere very well. If you read all kinds of newspapers, and also talk to your family spread all over the country, i'm pretty sure you easily get more then a micro-perspective. 

But you are right, this is not more then anecdotal and if that is not of interest to you, there is no use in discussing any of it.  

&gt; Historians look at both the micro- and macro-perspective. It is simply incorrect that they don't consider the perspective of the ""common people"" ‚Äì in fact, a lot of historical work revolves about just that. But still: If you look at the personal story and opinion of German people, you will probably get 65 million different perspectives on the proceedings of the time.

Well, i wish they would. Maybe you could give me any kind of credible study on this field. Because up to now i only see everyone almost doing exactly the same: taking official sources and interpreting them. I can't remember reading anything relevant from Zeitzeugen. I only always hear about people being questioned that went through 12 years of the most extreme indoctrination, which are hardly a useful source, because they are heavily mind fucked and biased.

Laws are not logical per se, meaning they are based on definitions that serve a certain purpose. We understand the concept of copyright, but it's not like a person not familiar with copyright will follow this concept by nature.

The purpose of copyright is to support the creator. Why do you want to support the creator? Because it supports economy as you said and it might support culture as well. But it's not like it was invented in our actual world. It was invented when information was shared a lot slower.

In times of the internet it is slowing down and in most cases even hindering creation. There is a lot of cool collage stuff that would not be happening without people ignoring copyright. Memes are just the most prominent example. They break copyright, yet they're enhance culture.

We see a lot of cool stuff happening in video-games, like fangames. Yet they do not contribute anything to, because they are forbidden. No economy, no culture. Wasted work, because of old copyright rules.

These are just two examples where copyright hinders economy, but another important one is YouTube. Almost each great is breaking copyright, yet we have a huge economic and cultural impact. They work way more efficiently then traditional TV.

But if they would need to negotiate a license for each copyrighted peace, Youtube wouldn't work. It would ad unnecessary management time. A lot of unnecessary management time.

852,"No. No we don't. This is something really frustrating about leavers who voted on immigration grounds; they're just wrong on so much and have no clue what we could do to change things without leaving the EU.

We could *massively* reduce migration from EU countries by making it much more difficult for Europeans to move here. If we were so inclined. But we don't register migrants, or place restrictions on companies recruiting directly from other EU member states, or insist that migrants go home if they don't find work within three months of arrival. All of that is totally legal and would absolutely have a major impact. We don't even clamp down on human trafficking from EU nations; something that the EU would actually really like if we did.

A shitload of employers indulge in illegal exploitation of their workers, and they're generally in precisely the industries that people complain about migrants undercutting British workers: agriculture, construction, domestic and cleaning work, etc. Clamp down on that, and you seriously undermine a *major* motivating factor for companies to hire foreign EU workers.

But it makes those businesses much richer, so don't expect a Tory government to move against worker exploitation.

And the EU has nothing whatsoever to say about what we do with non-EU migrants. We could have an Australia-style points system or something even harsher.

863,"&gt; Why the fuck do they have ""strategic interest"" at the other end of the world while most European countries just want to mind their business without meddling in other countries' affairs?

Because they are a global superpower. This literaly implies that they have global interests. And why particularely in Europe? Because Europe and the US share the same civilizational background, plus Europe is an advanced market and it's good for the US for us to be stable and trade with them.

You seem to preach how we should not be paranoid about Russia, yet you seem extremely paranoid about the US. My country has been in the sphere of influence of both and I can tell you that being in the sphere of influence of the US immensely better. Russia brings nothing to its allies but misery and opressive regimes.

On the other when it comes to specificaly post-communist EU countries, we have a pretty sweat deal with the US. Being a part of the EU, we are a part of a huge market, hence largely protected from any possibly exploitative US economic moves. When it comes to US foreign policy, they basically just expect you to match your foreign policy somewhat with theirs, the rest of what you do is up to you. They don't care how you administer your country, domestically we can do whatever the hell we want and even in foreign policy, we do not need to agree with whatever the US says, we just aren't supposed to go grossly against their interests. For example, we are not expected to have the same foreign policy on, say, Israel, as the US, we are just expected to take part in NATO missions and I would expect that the US will exert more and more pressure on their allies to establish a tougher line on China in the future.

But being tougher on China should be in the interest of European countries anyway.

As for Turkey-US relationships - if you are not happy with the alliance with the US, you certainly can take steps to form alternative allies. I believe Erdogan is already partly doing that with the S-400 purchase. You could certainly expect some negative consequences but not kicking the Americans out of your country, but if you really wanted to do that, you could.

Try an alliance with Russia and China instead, see how that works out for you. Trust me, we had this 'alliance' with Russia before, it was not much of a fun. But hey, be my guest.

&gt; A hint: they are not there to save you. They are there for themselves.

Yes, we do know that they are not here out of the kindness of their hearts. And so what, the important thing is that our interests are sufficiently similar. They want to be here, we want them here.

925,"&gt;The base load should be guaranteed by hydro+geo+nuclear. Reliable and clean sources.
The rest can be supplemented by wind and concentrated solar.

Baseload is not just a synonym for ""the majority"" or ""the most important"". It refers to an outdated practice from the time when we only had thermal plants in two forms: big, cheap and slow (typically coal), and small, expensive, and fast (typically gas). So the cheapest way to produce was to use the big plants whenever possible, and supplement the usage peaks with the fast plants.

Renewables have similar needs as the big thermal plants, including nuclear: they cannot adapt their production very well without efficiency losses (whereas flexible plants like gas and hydro cost the same whenever or however they are used). So you have a base of nonflexible plants (coal, nuclear, or renewables) and a supplementing production of flexible, dispatchable power (hydro, gas, geo) to jump in whenever the base can't match demand.

As you can see, you mischaracterize several power sources by assigning them an inefficient role for which they are ill-suited. Incidentally, this disadvantages renewables because they will have to shut off even when they could produce just fine, reducing their efficiency; and advantages nuclear power, which can run at full efficiency and forces the rest of the grid to adapt to its needs. That's a hidden subsidy.

Anyway, concerning the exclusion zones: assuming a 50% nuclear capacity in your proposal, that still means a new exclusion zone somewhere in the world every 4 years rather than every 2 years.

965,"&gt; That is historically incorrect. If the Communists really took over power, they would not have let it go. 

The only difference between your interpretation and mine is the definition of the term ""took power"". They for sure did not manage to takeover everything, but there were many regions, institutions, regiments and companies were they were much more successful then in others. Karl Liebknecht even proclamated the ""free socialist republic of Germany"", which were part of the Government even longer then the one in Munich. Both were gone in a matter of weeks, though. 

&gt; It is not a problem with my idea. Look at this map. It shows how many countries were democracies in 1919 and how many were democracies in 1939.

This map is extremely misleading. Hungary ended democracy already in 1919. Italy in 1922. Poland ended it's democracy in 1926. Spain in 1936, long after the black friday. 

&gt; No. The core of Nazism is racism and the biggest bogeyman they could find was ""the Jew"".

Not sure why you repeat this over and over again. The Bolsheviks *were* in Hitlers opinion the Jews and their ""Weltverschw√∂rung"" and entirely controlled by Jews. And the ""core of Nazism"" is entirely **useless** in our conversation. We don't talk about what Hitler and his Minions thought about Jews. We talk about how he got the People to vote for him. 

This difference is important, because the Jews in Germany themselves did not make such a good Boogeyman at that time. It was actually hard for the common population to see them as frightening. There were only 500.000 Jews in Germany at that time. And they did - by far - not control so many businesses, as we all long know. They weren't the mysterious superpower behind the entire economy. 

Just read some election speeches, newspapers or look at those posters of the time. Actually the (Jews  aren't even mentioned that often after 1930. They were more of a target for Hitler in 1928. But how successful this was showed the outcome of the Reichstagswahl, with 2.8%. Without extreme poverty and the red scare, nobody wanted to vote for Hitler at all. 

&gt; ...

Sorry, but the last part of your post sounds like a time line in a history book. 

People more and more make the mistake of taking ""Mein Kampf"" as some kind of election ad and mix in everything that happened later when he was in power without ever taking a closer look at the actual election battles. 

For me its important to stop this kind of bullshit. History is more and more rewritten to imply that those people at the time voted for Hitler to kill all Jews, to start another world war and to establish the Third Reich. And this is just not true. People were indeed poor and had no work. They were frustrated and angry. But they also were afraid every day in their life. Historians almost never seem to take the common folks into consideration when they interpret a situation. 

But according to my great-grandfather this part of the story is far more important, because seeing or hearing about those battles and even murder open in the street between KPD and NSDAP had a much bigger impact, with the context of the cleansings in Russia, on the psych of people than most Historians even notice. Its a part of a Historian ""reading"" bias. They read speeches, books, letters. Not of normal house wives or workers. But that of Hitler, Goebbels and so on. They also look at the other site and how they failed to fight this threat. At last they look at some numbers, like unemployment and GDP and what not and think ""Poverty seems to play a role"". Then they take this combined knowledge and think ""this is what the NSDAP had to offer and what the people bought with their votes"". 

What they can't measure is the general atmosphere of this time. About what people was talking in their homes and with their Neighbors. Don't get me wrong. People cared about food, money and how the government failed. But this is only a part of the whole picture. Because when they left their homes they regularly saw people stabbing and shooting each-other openly in the street, while the Government was completely unable to end this situation.

Of course people scared about food and jobs. But first and foremost they wanted security and stability back for the simple reason that this is the very foundation of any stable economy. The Government has proven to be completely unable to keep anything under control, while the SA presented itself as protector of the common people and as effective and strong enough to fight the red scare. And that was the among the strongest reasons why people saw Hitler as the way out to.

 ‚ÄúIf 70 years isn't sufficient how long should we stay in Europe? 700 years? Forever?‚Äù

No,  nothing is forever, but not yet. It‚Äôs not about 60,70,80, or 90 years. These are arbitrary numbers. Once Europe is fully capable to handle the obligations required in Europe, West Asia, and Africa, we can reduce presence, but that time is not yet. 

Europe can not even handle obligations within Europe. For exampleX Yugoslavia would have spiraled out of control without USA presence and intervention. Another recent example, Ukraine has been invaded and part of it annexed. Way too soon to talk about reduction of presence. 


‚Äú But I have doubts that Europe would ever send millions of soldiers to fight in the United States‚Äù

You may have doubts, but I don‚Äôt. Your doubts are your own. Thankfully the America‚Äôs have never been engulfed in a conflict like WW1 or WW2 on their own continent. But if the situation was truly drastic and the USA requested assistance, I am confident assistance would come(as long as Europe doesn‚Äôt completely hate us by then for our current president constantly berating and spitting on them).

Let‚Äôs not forget without European assistance and intervention(French and Spanish, but mostly French) USA wouldn‚Äôt even exist. They would not have won the revolutionary war on their own.

‚ÄúWhat's with the ‚Äúmost powerful nation‚Äù malarkey. First off, it's irrelevant as Europe is fully capable of defending themselves. They have a larger population, equivalent GDP, superior manufacturing, and greater wealth (Credit Suisse Global Wealth Report) than the US. We, on the other hand, are suffering another in a fairly long streak of embarrassing military loses. I'm not sure you can be a global power if you can't handle a bunch of rag tag ME irregulars. And I certainly do remember Clinton's illegal war. I don't know how they felt about it in Europe, but in the US I mostly remember bombing Christians in order to protect Sunni Muslims as payback to the Saudis for their co-operation during PG1‚Äù

USA as most powerful nation on planet earth has different responsibilities compared to a nation like Mongolia for example. As the EU gets more powerful they can assist us more and more. We should encourage further EU integration and even expansion(at the right pace and time) so that they can assist more in the future. This future expansion would include Russia and all nations in Europe eventually, emphasis on eventually.

Europe is not prepared yet, but they will be soon enough. We are now hearing support for European aircraft carriers(rather than a single country). Eventually it will be a fully pan European force. Europe does has superior GDP due to various reasons, but primarily because the US has Sabotaged itself. Mistakes like the Iraq War (which most of Europe argued against, but nonetheless many sent troops to support), lack of investment in education and healthcare has resulted in Europe overtaking the US in GDP. It‚Äôs still fixable, but USA needs to go back to policies which are less focused on private welfare. 

Bill Clinton did not launch an illegal war and his 8 years were some of the best in US history. Much better than Bush, trump, or Obama. Al Gore would have been good too, but it wasn‚Äôt meant to be I guess. The situation in Yugoslavia was ethnic cleansing and intervention to stop it. We did the right thing and Clinton acted fast(unlike Obama) to stabilize and create conditions where refugees can return before Europe was overwhelmed and eventually consumed by this terrible conflict.

As far as your Christian vs Muslim issue, that‚Äôs not what it was and irrelevant even if it was(which it wasn‚Äôt). The USA took the side of Croatia, Bosnia, Albania, Kosovo, Slovenia, and others who were all against the Serbs because of their actions. Serbs committed ethnic cleansing against Muslims and Catholics alike. Bosnia is a very nice and peaceful place today because of it. It was not about ‚Äúpayback‚Äù to the Saudis lol. The Saudi‚Äôs are the ones that owes the USA for the Persian gulf war, not vice versa. They literally begged the USA for intervention, and this was a source of tension later on and one of Osama Bin Laden‚Äôs grievances.



Regarding Canada. Let me just make something clear. The bases in Europe are there at the request of the USA, not vice-versa. Canada doesn‚Äôt want bases in Europe and has never requested them. Canada helps out in many ways. They sent a large contingent to Afghanistan, and other places. Unfortunately they tried to warn the republican administration of bush and all his right wing religious nutcase supporters that a full invasion of Iraq (I support intervention, but not invasion) was the wrong course to take. However, I have to be fair to George W. Bush and say the issue of Saddam was passed on to him by his father, who should have finished the job in 91 when he had full international backing and two simultaneous uprisings in Iraq he could have supported.

People don‚Äôt ‚Äúcall us Russians‚Äù. They are well aware the USA is not allied with Russia or Putin.

&gt;That's easy. That's nothing like the ""content recognition"" requirements originally in the Commission and Member States proposals.

&gt;And to stop platforms from ""going the extra mile"" and implementing systems like ContentID, which do not only prevent re-uploads but also try to detect adoptions of the same work

None of this is easy because nothing has been defined yet. What is ""same""? If a user alters one pixel is it still required to be blocked? If no it is useless. If yes then you are back to today's upload filters. If you say do it manually I will point out that google gets like 400 hours uploaded per minute.

&gt;the Commission, Member States, platforms, right holders and most importantly platform users, will have to go into dialogue to create industry standards regarding digital copyright protection.

This is absolutely hilarious. YouTube alone has 1.3 billion users. Tell me how you think this negotiation is actually going to unfold practically?

&gt;On top of that, Article 13 also requires right holders to justify take downs, and requires platforms to allow users to file an appeal. These appeals must be subject to human decision, so no more YouTube scenario's where they just ask the right holders again ""are you sure"" - to which the right holders will always say yes.

Google gets about 2 million takedown notices per day. That's why this is automated. What is the definition of ""justify""? One of the many hings TBD later?

It's funny every time someone suggests a company like google might just abandon the EU over this then people say smugly how you are 500 million people market.

While Tepco's speculation is that the fuel may be at the bottom of the reactor, it is a safe bet that at least some of it has burned through and has gone on to create an Uruguay syndrome.

1200,"&gt;Sure, give me your definition of occupied. You will very swiftly find that it is insufficient; what is the difference between conquest and occupation? It is a very blurry line you will see.

Both work here, in modern times occupied is usually used more.

You need to read better, i didn't say that, don't quote things that were not said. In this time with civilized laws this is not recognized. Territories use to be conquered but now with international law you can't just march in and take what you want.

1287,"If I had a dollar for every jaded and cynical foreign aid worker I've met here I'd retire.  It doesn't really work except where very clear and simple objectives exist, i.e. vaccines or wells or bridges,  and even then quite a bit of money is wasted.  I have no direct proof of this,  but given certain patterns,  I'd guess that a lot of aid work is designed to waste Africans' time and effort,  while providing humanitarian cover for our exploitation of Africa's resources.

The immigration issue is,  as with the US,  partially self-inflicted.  Giving aid to the governments knowing they are going to steal it and put it right back in western banks year after year after year;  convincing unsophisticated or uneducated leaders to take out massive loans that would weigh down their economies with debt,  which was done for 30 years leaving them more poor than they had been in the 1960s; and engineering coups during the Cold War.   Create a massive wealth imbalance and 20 years later you have a movement of people from poor to rich.

Also,  one thing that you would notice here is that aid agencies are happy to build primary schools,  but they give nothing to tertiary institutions.  This makes it a lot easier to recruit the best and brightest Africans to go to the west (and likely stay).

""LFTR produces electricity cheaper than from coal
Small, modular LFTRs can be factory-produced. Capital costs for LFTR electric power plants can be about $2/watt. Recovering capital expenses will cost about 2 cents per kWh for a plant operating 90% of the time with money borrowed at 8%. Thorium fuel cost is insignificant compared to coal costs. **LFTR can produce power at about $0.03/kWh, cheaper than coal.**""

Thorium Energy Cheaper Than Coal - Robert Hargraves (page 85)

---------------------------------------


1. There is no incentive for the nuclear industry to invest in the development of a new type of reactor (that goes against their business model). They construct reactors at or near cost and make money on the sale of fuel rods, much like an inkjet printer business model. With a LFTR you don't have to fabricate the fuel, just toss in the Thorium and go. This goes against their business model. 

2. Lack of military application, LFTRs breed Uranium 233 from Thorium 232, but always produce some degree of Uranium 232 contamination. Because of this it is more difficult to weaponize than enriching Uranium 235, or breeding Plutonium 239. LFTRs are not appreciable breeders, meaning they produce only enough Uranium 233 to continue their operation and no more, diverting Uranium 233 for use in weapons will cause the reactor to shut down.

3. Greenpeace and hippies hate anything with the word nuclear in it, and they refuse to listen to facts about LFTR technology. It is like arguing with a brick wall.

4. People are ignorant and aren't demanding their government invest in LFTR technology. Many have this attitude that if it were that good we would be using it already so it must be a hoax or a scam like a water powered car. It's sad really the thought we could uplift the developing world out of poverty and boost our standard of living tremendously, all from a technology that was proven viable more than 50 years ago, and NO ONE CARES.

5. It would take a huge financial investment to go from a small prototype reactor that was built more than 50 years ago, to a 1000MW commercial reactor. It would take government funding with a military budget to make this happen.

1495,"I'd argue that instead of letting lying, corrupt, politicians decide what to do with my money, I'd rather not pay taxes to the state and pay for my own health care.

The only somewhat arguable position, in my eyes, is for health care vouchers provided for people in poverty, so that they can choose where to spend that money. Also a system of tax credits would be great, you donate to a clinic of your choice, or school, and that donation gets deducted from your taxes. You get to support a local school, or a charity clinic, and you do so of your own vollition, except that now you have an extra incentive to support something you actually want, since it's you that decides where that money goes.

A combination of vouchers and tax credits is the only viable way to have availability, affordability and quality, because it places a massive incentive for companies to provide the best, lest they lose to competition, and removes the inneficient, corrupt and wasteful national systems.

The extra incentive to adopt a tax credits system is that it ensures that certain areas don't get by-passed when the city budgets get decided, no more taxation for people in low income areas that goes to fund the already well off schools in richer areas, the local community gets to support opportunity for itself directly.",Romania,/r/europe/comments/b0ppp4/polish_elderly_woman_picking_up_apples_scattered/eih1nui/,Kallian_League,1552522961

1539,"&gt; As for the financing i suggest you read this: link ... I dont really have time to explain economics but let me assure you that Polish economy is doing great and Poland market is fiscally conservative with 48.5% od GDP dept. This is great even for EU standards.

of course thats great, but take it with a pinch of salt.

poor, or poorer countries always do well when they make economic growth.
because they have so much ground to cover.
that growth wont keep going forever, eventually it will plateau.

here is the thing, take my country for example.

it IS possible for NL to grow like Poland.
but that would take a well oiled machine, and for all the stars to align as well.

its much more difficult for NL to grow like that because that growth has already been made decades ago.
you would have to create and innovate new sectors out of nothing to make growth like that in a 1st world country.

but for Poland its easy, the best proof i have for you is this.
Poland is suffering from a braindrain.
millions have left, and its projected that 4 million more will leave by 2040.
decreasing Polands population from 38 million to 34/33 million.
yet still Poland grows the way it does.

even though its running on 2/3rds of its engine.
its not a testament perse of Polands economic engine.
but that of its economic weakness.
because it has thousands of miles left yet to grow, it can grow.

with the right guidance and institutions a 3rd or 2nd world country can grow by billions within months.

the best example i have is Ethiopia.
its a 3rd world country, BUT it makes annual GDP growth of nearly 10% a year!

http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/ethiopia/publication/ethiopia-great-run-growth-acceleration-how-to-pace-it

its projected to become a middle class country by 2025.
and keep in mind, it has a population of 105 million.

so per capita it should outgrow Poland 3 to 1 if done right because the ceiling for growth in Ethiopia is much higher.

the country with the most potential, is India.
it has a population of 1.3 billion, its ceiling is up in the sky somewhere.

all in all, Polands growth will level out.
and you can kinda predict when that will happen when you compare it to similar countries.
that are wealthier than Poland, but have the same population size.
but that is simplifying it.

&gt; Its not as bad as you make it to be. It's just one government. And if PO gets power back, and it looks like a real possibility, Tusk will be one of the key players in Foreign Policy and he developed relationships with most of EU leaders. This will serve Poland well into the future. Besides, don't mistake Poland for PIS. This is just one right-wing political party. What about the other parts of the spectrum. Gotta stay optimistic. I think the future is bright.

sure i will agree on that.
but burned bridges are still burned bridges.

do you now trust the US more or less under Trump?
and would you trust the US to pull another Trump down the line?
thats kinda the thinking.

relations are repaired overnight when another party assumes power.
sometimes, even with the best intentions it could take years before trust is rebuilt.

take Poland and Germany for example.
Poles are still not that trustworthy of Germans even though WWII was nearly 80 yrs ago and Germany has done a ton to help Poland since then with its inclusion into the EU.

or South Korea and Japan.
even if both countries had people in power that wished to mend ties.
cultural resentment would stiffle that progress.
these are extreme examples compared to the EU and Poland today.
but similar.

you cant shit on others like Hungary does and expect everything to be hunky dory when Orban is out.
the west, including myself WILL demand political distance from Hungary.

and i expect other countries to do the same to NL if somehow Wilders or Baudet ever became a PM via a willing coalition.

and i can already tell you what will happen when either of those 2 become PM.

they will use the same tactics Poland and Hungary are using today, most likely even worse.

Independent creators make their own stuff. So while an upload filter might wrongfully flag something, if they use their own works this should not be an issue.

Finkelstein worked for Orban in '08, but Bill O'Reilly was already ranting about Soros in 2007. It just didn't gain mainstream appeal until around when far right nationalism gained mainstream appeal in general.

You can note that both he and Soros are in fact atheist. You can also note that being atheist or even converting to christianity didn't protect anyone from the Nazis. One of the fears the Nazis stoked was the idea that assimilated secular German Jews were an insidious evil force lurking in the shadows. Supporting the very kind of anti-semitic propaganda that fueled the holocaust is a betrayal of one's heritage regardless of your religious affiliation. It is putting others like you in jeopardy in exchange for personal political or financial gain. There were lots of people like that during WWII. There were the collaborators in Vichy France and across Europe who betrayed their fellow countrymen for the Nazis, and there were the Jewish collaborators who assisted the nazis to protect their own ass.

And yes, that same person also worked for Netanyahu, and he's also betrayed the Jewish diaspora by supporting fascists and right wing nationalists for his own political gain.

1838,"Please, explain why no other country, ever, has gone route of Thorium, but rather, like everyone (including those without nuclear bomb motivation), the good old uranium way? Did the Pentagon also prevented France, UK, Germany, Japan, Canada, China, India and the others to pursue this wondeful energy so cheap and easy? Heck, India is sleeping over the largest Thorium deposit, plus they have trouble getting uranium, and you know what, no Thorium reactors? Decades after decades? Did their scientists not know about it? Dont they have PhDs too? What gives?     
Or, could it be that the good old Physics and engineering constraints are the same for everyone and rendered the concept unappealing?      
It's confortable to think that there is a conspiracy against you, and those who fell are marthyrs, but maybe the engineering hurdles (and their economical translation) are good enough reasons.     

""all operations with remote equipment"", and at the stroke of a pen the issue is resolved with negligible cost and reliability impact? That is a leap of faith, not a rational argument.       
Imagine if I were to tell you I have this new concept of car, its so cheap, but the enitre construction, maintenance and driving has to be done remotely (but dont worry, it'll still be cheap). Wouldn't ask for a bit more?    
And everybody cirticising my idea is only part of a conspiracy.     


And the funny thing is that in the same breadth, you can also say ""the proportion of U-232 would be about 0.13% for a commercial power reactor. A year after separation, a weapons worker one meter from a subcritical 5 kg sphere of such U-233 would receive a radiation dose of 43 mSv/hr"".     
It's like ""this new car will be so cheap, oh, yes, the oil you'd put in is a million degrees, so you will have to drive remotely"".     

Look at the life expectancy of the robots they send into Fukushima, what they last in hours you can expect yours to last in days. And that is without talking about the added complexity, ie additional maintenance cost, and all the more things that can go wrong and stop your plant, ie your electricity/revenue, ie the whole reason people are going to put money in the project.     

I dont expect you to trust me, so go contact people who work on a nuclear power plant, idealy on radioprotection, safety or maintenance, and show them our conversation. Have they show you around. Picture the molten 233Pa, 232U and FP in the pipes, look again at the chemical processes required for LFTR. And when they stop laughing they'll explain better how ""Chemical Processing Plant"" on diagrams or ""all operations with remote equipment"" are just magic wand waving akin to ""Owing to radioactivity, the pilots will have to be shielded from the reactor"" when that just render the whole plan unflyable.   

Again, I have little doubt that a mab scale LFTR will exist relatively soon, and they will be interesting research tool; had I been younger I would I enjoyed playing with one. But that is not what we are talking about, we are talking about 24/7 for monts on end, 100MWe order electricity power plants.

1909,"&gt; If you compare the election results of 1920 and 1923, the extremist parties did gain votes. The USPD was replaced with the more extremist KPD, which rose from 2.1 to 12.6 %, while the NSDAP achieved 6.6 % ‚Äì its best result until 1930

There was no relevant vote in 1923. And in 1924 there were actually two Reichstags-elections, May and December. In the first the KPD and NSFB won some percent, in the second they lost again. Yes, there is a moderately relevant connection between poverty and extremism. But there is no real extremism without fear-mongering and hatred. 

&gt; Also, you say ""without a red scare"" ‚Äì sorry, this doesn't make any sense at all. Why would there be a red scare in 1930 if there isn't one in 1923? In 1923, the memory of the October revolution was much fresher as well as of the Spartakus Aufstand ‚Äì the threat of a communist revolution was much bigger in the early Weimar Republic than in the late Weimar Republic. Also, the Soviet Union was in a civil war and committed atrocities in the early 1920 as well. 

The bad stuff - the cleansing and the collectivization - started actually not before 28/29 and went on until 1940. Before that it was ""just another"" revolution. There were actually pretty many going on everywhere, including Germany. 

&gt; You mean when the police killed dozens of people? Yes, that happened.

It's a puzzle piece for understanding the general mood of the population back then and how charged with hatred this situation really was. Can you imagine living in a town where people fight each other almost every day? In that context it's also important that we shouldn't mix up what we know now and what the people knew back in the day. 

A good example of that are the events on the Bloody sunday a few years later, which were used in [this propaganda-poster](http://www.wahlplakate-archiv.de/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/nsdap-rtw1932-07.jpg), which also mentions the situation in Russia btw.

&gt; You are still massively overestimating the importance of this. Most people in Germany around the time probably didn't know much about the situation in Russia, as news coverage was much slower and also less frequent than today.

&gt; Also, the SPD was anti-Communist and anti-Bolshevik as well, which she proved by destroying the Spartakus uprising as well the left-wing governments of Saxony, Thuringia in 1923 and the Soviet republic of Bavaria in 1919.

And you underestimate it, by giving the people by far too much intellectual credit. As if every single person read ""Mein Kampf"" and understood Hitlers muddle-headed master plan. The opposite was true in fact.  You see the same happening with Trump in the US. Do you think his voters actually read his books to understand how he is thinking and how he want's to change our economy for the better?

Hitlers Propaganda was based on the principle to use simple, short slogans that needed to be repeated over and over again. As a result of that all of his propaganda Pamphlet's were either directed at the failures of the SPD, or they were directed at Jewish-Bolsheviks/Marxism. It was a simple mix of blaming your enemy(SPD &amp; other established Parties) for whatever is going wrong and a lot of fear-mongering.",Franconia,/r/europe/comments/azqd8h/march_11th_1919_germans_go_hungry_as_famine/eifguab/,lmolari,1552485245

&gt;As for EU citizens, member states aren't required to make foreign EU nationals citizens, and EU law doesn't require the UK to give them residency for longer than 6 months unless they can prove that they're working, studying, or pensioners (they can demand proof after 3 months and apply increasingly steep fines if they don't supply any, but not actually kick people out until after 6). In addition, people can be deported immediately if they are a risk to ""public policy, public security, or public health"" which includes things like homelessness.

2005,"The Irish farming industry gets boned no matter what, assuming no-deal, regardless of the tariff schedule.  Zeroing all farm tariffs would still result in Irish farmers being screwed.

It immediately has to compete with the rest of the world for the British market without protection, and that's the big factor.

If you impose high food tariffs across the board, people pay more for food.  Can't not eat.  They give up some other non-food luxury instead.

They might purchase a *different* sort of food, a [substitute good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitute_good).  And maybe that could hurt or benefit Irish farmers who produce or don't produce it.

And hypothetically, because we're talking staple goods, if you imposed a high-enough tariff, maybe you could see a [Giffen good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giffen_good).

But I'm pretty sure that the problem for Irish farmers in no-deal is really suddenly being on a more-or-less even playing field with the rest of the world, not just ""everyone having high tariffs"" or ""everyone having low tariffs"".  Doesn't really matter so much whether the tariffs go to zero (all farmers in the world pay the previous low tariff paid by Irish farmers) or the tariffs stay at an EU level (Irish farmers have to pay as much as farmers elsewhere in the world).",üá∫üá∏ United States of America,/r/europe/comments/b0jkey/uk_gov_releases_tariffs_in_case_of_a_nodeal/eif90lf/,vokegaf,1552477986

Maybe voters needed to learn that voting for a party or policy does in fact result in that party taking power or that policy being enacted. There have been several instances lately of people objectively voting against their own best interests to ""send a message"" and not realising the consequences.

We should still accept their vote, of course, because any alternative to democracy is worse. But a functioning democracy requires _informed_ voters. If it takes millions losing their jobs because the companies they were promised would never leave after Brexit left after Brexit and the 350 million they were promised would be spent on the NHS weren't spent on the NHS for voters to learn that politicians will lie to get elected, so be it.

The best outcome of this is that people might become a lot more skeptical with regards to what politicians tell them. The UK has a proud tradition of democracy; perhaps people will treat the next elections with more respect, and if they support Brexit, at least support Brexit for good reasons and not because of some vinyl on a bus.",Belgium,/r/europe/comments/b0bv40/brexit_deal_vote_the_nos_have_it/eif46hu/,EnaiSiaion,1552471265

2191,"Referendum doesn't have to be legally binding to be a solution. Politicians can use the result even if there's no one option with more than 50% support.

When you have a society split on some issue there's no way to have everybody happy. People will see what the options are, and can choose lesser evil if they want. And there will be unhappy people anyway.

The first mistake was to make a referendum on ""leave or stay"" with no specific conditions. That's like asking ""do you want this job"" without providing the responsibilities and salary. Meaningless question that shouldn't be binding.

Repeating that stupidity now wouldn't solve anything, so ""a brexit or stay"" question makes no sense. Conditions of brexit must be specific.

Removing the most currently supported option (stay) only because people were misled in previous referendum to answer meaningless question with false assumptions is stupidity as well. So the option ""stay"" must be in the new referendum.

If the chickens accepted the offered grain, then the Roman gods would be favourable to the battle. However, on that particular morning of 249 BC, the chickens refused to eat ‚Äì a horrific omen. Confronted with the unexpected and having to deal with the superstitious and now terrified crews, Pulcher quickly devised an alternative interpretation.

2298,"&gt; Just because you need a government to establish an institution does not mean it then controls it henceforth.

No it does not. But as far as I understand, you would like more French-German integration. This is something that has to be initiated from the executive. The judiciary will not do that for you. The Parliaments will not do that for you.

This is my whole point about the overall EU integration. It's not that it's the only force shaping it, but it's the primary force driving it. Or you think any of the current work between the Parliaments would be worth something if in the next elections, the French elected Le Pen or Melanchon? Of course not. The judiciary and the Parliament can put some limits on what the executive can do, they can shape it to some extent, but they are not the ones driving it.

And if you want more substantional French-German integration in a relatively short time-frame, you will need to have the high-level politics involved. You can't just do without it, you can't bypass this by focusing on say, cross-border cooperation. Or some other relatively 'small issues'. This is how the european integration was trigerred in the beginning, by European high-level politicians initiating it and this is how more major integration efforts will continue be driven as long as the member states' governments conitnue holding the most power in their hands.

&gt; I would say that deeper integration of Germany and France will eventually result in deeper European integration, but of course I would.

I would say that as well a few years back, nowadays I think so less and less. Perhaps in the case of Benelux, but in the case of the South, East and the North (by North I mean Nordic in this case), I find it increasingly less likely, even though the reasons are different for each region.

Referendums are questionable enough as they are (in the sense of the broad population having difficulty evaluating the consequences of complex decisions), but referendums on vague options are worse than useless (as we saw with the Brexit referendum - people thought they were voting for vastly different things). 

If a second referendum must be held, then it only makes sense to do so with a fully negotiated exit treaty (and not the half-assed current ‚ÄúBrexit deal‚Äù, which is little more than a two-year holding pattern while all the important questions are further negotiated).

**The Gulag Archipelago is clearly a history, based on hundreds of  first hand accounts.**  It's an amazing  achievement produced under incredibly difficult circumstances (the Soviet police state) and smuggled out to the west.         It's absurd to criticize it for not meeting the standards of a traditional academic work produced in an open society.  He literally was **risking his life just by collecting the accounts it contains**, and more so by publishing it.       

 Would you deign to read Herodotus, because he too included legends?   Or would you acknowledge that what they wrote was based on oral histories,  --which were all that was available-- and that such histories inevitably are imperfect.  

(Hell, considering how regularly the Soviets cooked the books of their official recordkeeping, oral histories are probably the **best** sources for what really happened -- check out ""the Commisar Vanishes"" for a history of how the Soviets even lied with photography, by airbrushing  and cropping  photos to try to alter the past)

I think the main challenge for the quality of life in modern times is housing prices, which has been driven by all sorts of stupid policies, such as encouraging internal and external immigration to a few metropolitan hubs, driving competition through the roof, as well as encouraging investment in housing, giving preferential tax treatment for housing, allowing unfettered external shady investments (e.g. Chinese, Russian), having most central authorities and universities in just a few cities, and all sorts of other things.

They can only get an extension if there are new elections or a referendum. And even then nothing will change on the EU‚Äôs side. This is it, this is the withdrawal deal they asked for. 

So new elections/referendum will need to bring clarity on the options above.

Not specifying the type of brexit being voted for meant leave campaigners could promise something different to every person/group they talked to, even when the different options were mutually exclusive or impossible to implement.

&amp;#x200B;

That is what's causing the gridlock now. With 5 different types of mutually exclusive brexit options, each of which was promised to various segments of the population, implementing any one of them is political suicide.

2857,"Yes, mostly in the East along the Catholic-Protestant border with Orthodoxy. The spread of each faith shifted according to how national borders changed. So what was once German Protestant is today either Polish Carholic or Russian Orthodox. Similarly, the change of Polands eastern borders made Catholicism retreat but also expand in some places.  

Other notable change is the large decline of Greek-Catholicism in what was once Eastern Hungary.  This map assigns them to Catholics so they can't be differentiated, but on [this one](https://static2.habsburger.net/files/styles/large/public/originale/lit_5498_karte12.jpg?itok=_wyqh908) you can see that Greek-Catholicism had a large following in Hungary, mainly among Romanians and Ruthenians (but also Hungarians to a lesser extent).  I don't know about their story in Czechoslovakia/Soviet Union/Ukraine (but according to wikipedia the Ukrainian G-C Church still has 4,5 million followers), but in Romania the Romanian Greek Catholic Church faced heavy persecution and was even outlawed between 1948 and 1990,  turning what was [once the majority faith of Romanians in Transylvania](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e8/Greco-catolici_Romania_%281930%29.png) into a [small minority religion](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3e/Greco-catolici_Romania_%282002%29.png). Their persecution is a story quite unknown in most of Europe sadly.

2959,"&gt; Which is basically what I meant from the beginning. If some more French-German convergence happens, it will be because of the external influences (in this case China and the US) not because French and German MPs decide to hang out with each other twice a year.

Two points: first, circumstances does not mean that you can act on them. For this you need some institutions already in place with which you can form a coherent policy/even perceive of having a particular alternative. 

Secondly, I already pointed out in my initial post that the Franco-German parliamentary assembly is just one of several different intergration measures of the national parliaments. This is important, because it allows for day-to-day interactions. In particular, parliamentarians of the relevant commitees will meet before important EU summits.

Thirdly, it is not that unlikely that the parliamentary assembly will meet more often or at least work more often (even if you don't have full sittings). This is because the Treaty of Aachen has several measures which pushes for integration of the border regions, requiring oversight. Other measures, such as a renewed push to re-invigorate the Franco-German security council (yes, it exists) is supposed to have more oversight as well.

&gt;Obviously, Green German MPs and Green French MPs can chat as much as they want, but ultimately they either need to have the numbers on their side or they need to be a junior partner in the government.

Which is more relevant than you give it credit for two reasons. First, the Greens not only talk to Greens but all Pro-EU voices. LREM is one of them. Secondly, the Greens nearly became the major minor coalition party of the current government already. Their poll numbers have stabilised at ~18-20%, higher than last time, for now as well. 

Returing to my initial point, you do need institutions to have common policies on the table once the circumstances change.

2970,"This is the equivalent of saying to the poor ""Let them Drive Tesla's"". There is roughly 300 Million vehicles used in Europe and new cars are being bought at around 18 million a year in EU. If we were to outlaw non electric cars tomorrow it would take some 15 for that to actually cycle that out. That's ignoring that it would take a decade if not two to even reach production levels needed for that. Current EV sales are around 1 Million a year. 

You don't have global battery production capacity to get to 18, let alone just for Europe. Before you wave your hands to just suggest that it will be all taken care of by investment, currently we're going to quadruple battery production globally by 2028, but most of that is going into the Chinese market. You need a far larger increase to go from 1M global to 18M for the EU.

No, surely rampant apologia among the highest politican ranks for the fascist genociders of the 1940s and the war criminals who perpetrated the ethnic cleansing of Serbs during the 1990s isn't part of the equation.

They were more tribalistic because their nation was at the same time a religious body in which the main way to enter was to being born in it, the exclusion was not one way street was both way, and this tribalism is coming way before christianity it's coming from the times of republic

""The large majority of prisoners at most times faced meager food rations, inadequate clothing, overcrowding, poorly insulated housing, poor hygiene, and inadequate health care. Most prisoners were compelled to perform harsh physical labor.[85]¬†In most periods and economic branches, the degree of mechanization of work processes was significantly lower than in the civilian industry: tools were often primitive and machinery, if existent, short in supply. Officially established work hours were in most periods longer and days off were fewer than for civilian workers. Often official work time regulations were extended by local camp administrators.""

""A distinctive incentive scheme that included both coercive and motivational elements and was applied universally in all camps consisted in standardized ""nourishment scales"": the size of the inmates' ration depended on the percentage of the work quota delivered.¬†Naftaly Frenkel¬†is credited for the introduction of this policy. While it was effective in compelling many prisoners to work harder, for many a prisoner it had the adverse effect, accelerating the exhaustion and sometimes causing the death of persons unable to fulfill high production quota.""


""Among the prisoners there are some so ragged and liceridden that they pose a sanitary danger to the rest. These prisoners have deteriorated to the point of losing any resemblance to human beings. Lacking food . . . they collect orts [refuse] and, according to some prisoners, eat rats and dogs.""

3205,"&gt; I have never claimed that this was a reason why Hitler was voted into power. 

For me that is the only logical conclusion i could draw out of your first post. You said the events of World war 1 lead to the German strive for autarky. This simple sentence has a lot of implications. At the very least this implies - as i understand it - that it has to be a part of Hitler ""vision"" and that the Germans voted for him in cause of this ""vision"", because they supported this point of view. 

I however doubt that Hitler made in any way clear that he planned to go to war again. The entire world had economical problems at this time. The black friday resulted in around 30% unemployment in Germany and a lot of emergency rules, that hit many people very hard. So can you imagine Hitler selling his idea of going to war with Russia to people that were nothing but piss poor and fighting for food every day of their life? He would have been perceived as nothing but a maniac, by everyone but his closest followers. Even mentioning war would've been crazy at this point. 

And if you listen closer to his Speeches he despised not only Bolsheviks, he also despised Capitalism. That we even have something like an free economy at all was wrong to him. He clearly wanted to go back to Imperial times, without a Government and citizens that are controlled by economic interests. In his opinion the ""Schwertadel"" was being replaced slowly by ""Finanzadel"" which led to a morally rotten, selfish, (and of course obligatory for hitler:) ""Bankjuden""-controlled society. 

I still think that didn't was enough to win the vote. He may have agitated the masses a bit and sold them his idea of a better Germany. But to drive the people in such masses in his arms, more was necessary. And i think the ""red scare"" was indeed the bigger reason to radicalise people and make them vote for Hitler, who hated nothing more then the Bolsheviks. 

&gt; So instead of thinking how to prevent the next war, the Nazis were thinking about how to win the next war. And if you are following this logic, autarky is a logical choice.

Yes, you are right. Autarky is important, to fight any kind of war. Still not sure if they is the fundament to everything for the Nazis, though.",Franconia,/r/europe/comments/azqd8h/march_11th_1919_germans_go_hungry_as_famine/eicfwhs/,lmolari,1552391659

Really, anything to support that? From what I've seen there is limited capacity, and the approach at the moment is reuse rather than recovery and that the optimistic targets for future recovery are 2/3rds of batteries being processed at all for materials (with no real clarity on what waste will be produced as recycling and recovery is focused on the valuable components).

It's great that there is a focus on this from the outset, but it still seems to be an issue, especially as car sales scale up.

&gt;Not it is not.

The industry seems to think it is..

&gt;It is. The recyling units will scale as Li-ion battery use scales.

You hope. And they still produce waste. So yeah.

&gt;Also, you ignored the bigger point I make. Refining crude to get gasoline is an extremely energy intensive process. The final product is burned off. That's much more wasteful that mining minerals and manufacturing battery cells.

If you look at battery recycling generally at the moment, it's a bit of a shit show. With EV's it should be far better, but even then you still have waste. IIRC the actual lithium component of the batteries is currently not economic to recover either (although that could be solved by adding a cost up front).

I'm not suggesting it's a worse outcome than using fossil fuels, but to claim that it is a solved issue is inaccurate.

That is true of course and many German industrials benefited directly from running huge parts of their operations with slave labour.

This one is a bit of a mixed bag because at the start of the war against Poland many people did support what they viewed as retaliation against Polish aggression (which was bullshit propaganda ofc) and in their eyes the rightful reclamation of East German territory taken from them after Versailles. 

On the other hand support for a large-scale war against France (and by extension Britain) was low as many people did not want a repeat of the horrors of WWI.

3287,"&gt;The ""Stab in the Back Myth"" is just that a myth. When in doubt don't side with Hitler.

It's not a myth when there are facts to back it up. The Balfour Declaration that was used by the British government in order to get the Rothschilds and other jews to support the British Empire financially and cut off the Germans from necessary supplies (mainly finance). The other was to get the United States in the war (which they did, again, with the help of jews). Woodrow Willson's cabinet was zionist and he himself extremely so. His advisors and the jewish lobby pushed him to sign the declaration and to join the war.

As for Germany, many of the Weimar revolutionaries were jews and other zionists, willing to emulate what happened in Russia with Lenin.

So again, you're putting individual jews.

As far as the Judenzahlung, it actually showed the opposite. It showed that only 12,000 jews died in the war which is absolutely miniscule compared to what their population was at the time (around 7-800,000). Which is exactly why it fuelled so much fire into the anti-semitism debate in Germany at the time. It certainly didn't show jews in the best of light and if it did, the Germans back then wouldn't have been angry at them.

3293,"&gt;That was already the case. The backstop is only activated if no other deal is reached, and it will end when one IS reached; the UK has **never** had to be bound to the backstop indefinitely. And the EU and UK are obviously already committed to reaching an agreement to replace it.

And if no deal can be reached, through intractable and earnestly held differences, the UK *would* remain permanently stuck in the backstop arrangement with no unilateral capabilities to end that.

I'm not saying the EU will forcibly attempt to keep the UK in that position, but it's the position it would be stuck in if through mutual disagreement no progress could be made.

That is the primary contention British lawmakers have, not what you have described (that parties may not actually *want* a deal).

Like a patriarchal structure might be used in a system of racial opression and voting for its continuity could result in personal gain, because the continuity of racial inequalities outweighs the personal loss inflicted through sexist inequalities.

However, I was only trying to showcase that there are instances of people clearly acting against their own self-interest (be it not that clear in most cases, as you point out). Because the existence of such instances was important in the argumentation, as it poses the question why someone would do that. This brings us to the concept of internalized opression.

A people held against their will in a union are a people who will find hate growing in their hearts.

The British establishment has ignored the people‚Äôs will for decades now, on more issues than just the EU. Do not think for one moment they wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to drag us towards the ever more integrated EU without directly asking us. 


If you can figure out a magical way to change the key component of this equation, the British public‚Äôs attitude. Please do so. I don‚Äôt think they is a way however beyond a slow generation crawl towards it.

The other solution of course could be the EU letting the UK remain tied to them in some way but as some kind of special satellite to the EU, where we don‚Äôt have to fully integrate but we are a part of the project as close as possible.

Well, you may not care about economics, but economics care about you, so to speak. If a step X makes country worse off in terms of wealth, trade, and economic opportunities, the step X is bad in my reckoning.

&gt; The basic undeniable fact is Britain is rich enough to pay its way through any brexit related costs and come out the other end still a major global economy, of the top tier. To state otherwise is to make yourself look a fool.

Sure, but for what? To continue in the above example, if the step X makes my country worse off temporarily in order to deal with a major problem or crisis that would make my country even worse off in the long term, then the step X is justified (e.g. austerity, green politics to avert environmental damage, etc.). 

But this is not the case of Brexit at all. Staying in the EU is not a disaster to be averted as it is objectively economically beneficial to the UK. Brexiters invoke the ""blitz spirit"" of surviving through self-imposed adversity to achieve... what? All they offer are nebulous promises of ""global Britain"", sunny uplands and unicorns which most people who know anything about economics and international trade have debunked time and time again.

3388,"I‚Äôve explained my thinking a thousand times on this sub the last two years, I‚Äôll try again for you.

British people did not, do not and never will want ever closer union. Ever. 

The EU is on a path towards this. An unavoidable, inescapable path.

So for Britain to remain in, it either has to become an ever louder roadblock to this process, burning up all good will until we are detested by the other countries of the EU, or be forced into this union against the British public‚Äôs will. These are the ONLY possible options of leaving is taken off the table.

In either of these, you would have a situation where Britain leaves anyways (either kicked out or voluntarily) but where the costs of leaving are infinitely worse than at the moment, or you would have a furious British public part of larger union they hate. What has history taught us about an oppressed people forced into unions they don‚Äôt like? British people would become a poison within the EU, a cancer. And you cannot call a people forced into a union they hate anything but oppressed.

If we are forced to leave further down the line, after our country is integrated more and more then the complexity of such a split grows. The financial cost starts entering into the apocalyptic territory, it would cause a shock to the UK and EU economies so bad both might take decades to recover.

Again I admit, all of this is predicated upon the fundamental truth that the British public will never want to be in a United States of Europe or an ever closer union. I may be wrong on this and if so, I‚Äôll admit my vote was mistaken and I should have voted remain. I do not think I am wrong however so I had to vote with this reality in my mind.


With the scenarios I mentioned then it must be obvious to you why leaving now is a very small price to pay, compared to the future ones, no?

Did you actually read the link I included? No one says they were ""behind slavery"". The link in question notes that they were significant players. Here's one example from the Wiki link I provided:

&gt;By the turn of the 6th to the 7th century, Jews had become the chief slave traders in Italy, and were active in Gaelic territories. 

You know where that quote comes from? The Jewish Encyclopedia. Here is [the link.](http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/13798-slave-trade) The authors are  Isidore Singer, and Joseph Jacobs and their credentials are fairly impressive, and here is the more elliptical language they use:

&gt;At the time of Pope Gregory the Great (590-604) Jews had become the chief traders in this class of traffic.

You can read the accompanying verbiage to see what they mean by ""this class of traffic"" and thereby verify that the wiki paraphrase is accurate.

Hardcore brexiters want a no deal because to them it‚Äôs the cleanest possible break, without having some insidious (as they see it) tie still to the EU, which can be used to make us out in name only.

3672,"I'm glad to see a topic like this posted here, it's usually charts and overly filtered pictures.

  
There's a few realities, one is that in Europe's wealthies country to many of it's poorest - your upbringing plays a significant part in what universities you'll attend, the level of medical treatment you'll receive, and even the jobs you'll land regardless of your grades.

  
There is a significant amount of income inequality throughout Europe, many areas try but at the end of the day, pressure from large corporations wins the day. The right direction is when we allow universities to be affordable to any income bracket, for every person to have to same opportunity to go to whatever university, where getting in is based on merit, IQ, interest rather than wealthy parents. And the much harder job is to make it in a way where employers aren't discriminatory either. Of course literally every country has laws against that, enforcing it is another story. 

  
That all plays directly into this issue in general of the welfare state. Finland was an absolute gift to Trump's people and those that think like them, where people want to live off the system, they want everything handed to them. It of course failed because yeah, people were liking the money with little to no work. The fact that so many people on Reddit thought it'd not only 100% work without any doubt but why isn't the entire world doing it immediately?!  

  
And like Trump supporters who want low education, low income jobs, we also need a society where we encourage those people to go to university rather than force them into a corner to the point of unemployment thus they are on the welfare system, are stuck in those extremely low paying jobs and are relying on handouts. I completely agree with some of Trump's supporters (okay that felt weird typing that, not gonna lie) where a 50yr old man that still has to work, that's been working on a farm his ENTIRE life with a high school education would find it insanely difficult to suddenly work on the robotic equipment now handling those farms as many suggest. The idea is welp now you keep the robots running! Simple! No it's not!!! lol 

  
This subject will always be an issue, it's just now we're facing a new era and require a new way of thinking. And I'm glad Finland did what it did with it's basic income, it did fail in many ways but there's also some new lessons that we can take from it from it's actual success that can be applied to any society big or small.

3720,"I agree with you when you say that defeating the Germans certainly improved Stalin's perception in the USSR. 

Interestingly enough Stalin actually didn't see the German invasion coming at all. In fact he delayed the Soviet response to Operation Barbarossa significantly. Stalin legitimately believed Hitler wouldn't break the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact even after 'Mein Kampf' and invading Bessarbia. In all fairness Germany starting a second war when the then greatest empire of the world lay waiting across the English Channel was probably unlikely in most people's minds. Even when multiple highly placed spies reported that Barbarossa would come within days Stalin refused to believe them. He refused to order a general mobilization of armed forces against the advice of his generals until the invasion was already underway. It took even longer still until Stalin allowed Soviet forces enter German territory. Of course the ordinary civilian, both Western and Soviet wouldn't have known this and Stalin's refusal to abondon Moscow under siege is quite notable. Even George Orwell, no fan of the USSR, complimented Stalin for this in Animal Farm. 

I suppose it all comes back to propoganda in the end. Making people believe that Stalin saved the USSR, as opposed to talented generals like Zhukov and Konstantinovich. Stalin's own offensives like the battle for Kharkov were disastrous failures. He mainly reaped the PR benifits of his victorious generals.

3754,"From a different perspective: this is the state enforcing laws and finally strengthening itself to maintain a civil society. 

For context, these are houses built illegally, in either state lands or private land that belongs to other people. After the communist regime in the early 90s until early 2000, the state was too weak to intervene and many people built homes or occupied state buildings. These buildings are not up to code, many times not safe to occupy, lack proper sanitation and more importantly not legal or permited. In the last decade or so the state has slowly picked up itself form the bootstraps. It has enforced collection of taxes, improvement of public works and social services, empowered the local police, given independence to the judiciary, currbed illegal and under ground markets and gambling, significantly increased war on drugs and taken huge steps in improving the rule of law. Anyone that had a chance to visit albania 10 years ago vs now can easily tell the difference in the quality of policing. 

The houses in question should be demolished because they are illegal, that alone should suffice. However that is not the reason here, the plan is to build a necessary road that would serve many more than just this family. In every country the state has the right to eminent domain.

Getting other peoples' votes is also hard since it'd require signed consent *but also* the stempass holder's ID and a municipal registry of the consent in most cases, which require the person to be present in nearly all cases, so a few people with suddenly a lot of stempasses also would be extremely suspicious straight off the bat.

     A huge part of this was detection of the fleet, and in fact the Soviets/Russians had/have dedicated ""sniffer"" aircraft dedicated to the role of finding CSG's. This is a key facet of naval warfare that many people with narratives like to ignore. With these Swedish &amp; Dutch submarine ""sinkings"" of carriers is because that they Swedes &amp; Dutch have a general area of where the carrier is operating. These nations do not have the resources to locate a carrier strike group, sure they may get lucky and just stumble upon a carrier, but this also ignores the various defenses of the CSG.

Why ? 

&gt; The US certainly has problems, but there you actually get a trial and (most) inmates have some sort of reason to being there. 

In the Soviet Union a bunch of people got trials, which weren't exactly fair. Which is rather crucial. The reason for many people being in prison in the US is racism rather than political oppression.

4066,"tldr; I, an old Polish guy who grew up in Poland and have lived in the US most of my adult share my opinions about individual vs. collective guilt for Hitler's rise to power and its similarity to the recent rise of nationalism we see in Poland and the US. 

I was born 15 years after the end of WWII in Poland so the war was still a part of my parents' and their generation's lives. They still lived it. They talked about it as if it ended a few months back. 

Going back to the individual responsibility of each German for raise of Hitler and Nazism, no not everyone, as an individual is responsible. But Hitler was elected democratically. I've lived in the US for the past 30 years so there is an analogy between the election of Hitler and Trump. He was elected democratically, well sort of, the electoral system in the US is broken. He has his supporters despite the bad things he is doing, separating immigrant children from their families being probably the worst at this time. He is a liar, a cheater, a fool, a megalomaniac, a con artist. In a Gallup poll from two weeks ago this approval rating is 43%. Normal, sane president range. We are seeing what happened in Germany in the early thirties. To that you have to add global depression, the feeling of being wronged by The Treaty of Versailles and voila, fertile ground for scumbags like Hitler and his gang to sow the seeds of hatred. Once you let them have power it's too late. They organize bands of young, brainless thugs like Brown Shirts in Hitler times or ONR and MW in Poland today. 

We are seeing a similar pattern in Poland. The rise of nationalism, racism, anti-semitism, xenophobia. Let's just say intolerance in general. The current government leaders don't hide their disregard for democratic values and system of government. This is how those things start. 

So let's say Trump or Kaczy≈Ñski starts WWIII. What would be the individual responsibility of each American or Pole for the lives lost and the suffering caused? Those who worked for those governments would certainly be responsible, those who voted for them to a lesser extent. Those who were not paying attention to politics would bare some responsibility. But those who opposed them? Or those millions who actively express their discontent and organize to vote Trump and PiS out of power. I don't think you can blame those people. 

Should Germans as a nation feel some burden of guilt and responsibility for what happened. I think they should. Just like we Poles should feel the same for what happened to the innocent Germans, the Jews, the Ukrainians, the Lithuanians. I certainly do carry the sins of my fathers.

4072,"Listen, let me clarify this in the simplest of fucking ways:

1.  You're all caught up abut individuals and the rare ""innocent"" person here and there.  Yet you started a world fucking war.  Individuals go right out the fucking window when that happens.  Individual justice is a luxury reserved for times of peace and prosperity.  Nobody is going to fucking worry about innocent Germans after the German army just killed millions of their fellows and ruined their cities.  Nobody.
2.  For the most part, everyone is happy to forget what Germany did.  It's the past.  Whether in Poland or France or Russia, people would really rather just move forward.  But when Germans start bitching about *German victims of the war*, that's fucking infuriating.  Suddenly, all the injustices of the past are brought forward, because if you're going to bitch about some deportations, then everyone else has a lot more to bitch about.

For example:

Poland was a loyal ally of the West.  Poles fought hard.  Poles had a resistance that put the famed French resistance to shame.  Poles fought in the Battle of France, the Battle of Britain, and in Normandy.

And yet, at the same time as the US was investing billions of dollars (1950s dollars, at that) into Germany, American nuclear bombers and missiles were aimed at Polish cities and bridges across the Bug, Vistula, and Oder rivers.

While Germans were experiencing the greatest economic boom in European history, Czechs were being killed by Soviet tanks in Prague.

You have no right to bitch.   None.  Zip.  Zilch.  Zero.  Nada.  Not only that, but it's not in your interest to bitch.  Because when you start bitching about ""the poor German victims of WW2"", you fucking infuriate everyone who was actually a victim of German aggression.

So shut up.  I'm not even asking you to shut up and eat shit, I'm telling you to simply shut up.

4170,"Good post. Posting Nuraghe Santu Antine.  


 Built around the 15th-14th century bc:  
The main tower originally had three overlying tholos roofed chambers and it reached a height of 22-23 meters. The structure also comprised 27 meters long corridors built with a corbel arch roof. The corridors were superimposed on two levels and connected the towers of the bastion to each other and to the main one. The tholos chamber in the ground floor is 10,5 meters high.  
Like Nuraghe Arrubiu, and unlike Su Nuraxi, this complex nuraghe seems to have been built following a cohesive, unitary project, as proven by the recently discovered drainage system running under the bastion.  
""The recent excavations by the Superintendence of Archaeology, Fine Arts and Landscape for the provinces of Sassari and Nuoro with the coordination of the archaeologist Franco Campus, have shown that the construction of the complex was preceded by the realization of an advanced work of hydraulic engineering , a water drainage system that allowed water to be channeled into the three wells inside it, eliminating that in excess. The Nuraghe Santu Antine, for its harmonious forms, the construction expertise, but above all, for the project underlying its construction, can be considered one of the greatest expressions of nuragic architecture, so as to be known as ""Sa Domo de su Re"" (the house of the king).

With the US Jewish population and reliance on oil I see no way America will break it‚Äôs relationship with Israel or Arab Nations for Poland. The Israeli/American claim is unfair, but tbh Polish government after Polosh government did not introduce a reprivatization law, while all other countries in the region did. Most state todays equvalent for what the house was after the war, so land with rubble. Land based on old, not new prices. So countries like Czechia, Hungary, Baltics or Russia are returning very symbolic amounts, and the families can ask the Germans (who did the destruction) for equivalent of the houses if they want. Most countries have such laws since the 90s. If Poland also had one it would not be in this situation. So I have no idea, why all govermnets acted anti-Polish and did not enact any law. I mean, some might have been corrupt, but all? AWS and SLD, PO and PiS etc? So many options have ruled and no reprivatization law.

But again in a dark time Poland will be in trouble if the US turns away and chooses Israel. Unlike you, I like the EU and have no problems with current Germany and France, but as those countries have bigger economies, so Poland will always have to play by their rules.

4327,"&gt;Wut. Like afaik it's marked, but that's it, for all intents and purposes, there is no border, which came about partly as a result of the Good Friday Agreement.

There are different laws on each side of that border, different courts, different police officers, different taxes, different rules on abortion (sadly) different education systems, different rules on excise goods, different VAT rates... If that is 'no border for all intents and purposes' then how is adding 'different customs rules' a major issue?

That's the point here, the difference between now and once the UK has left the EU will be that the UK and Ireland are in different customs territories, with different rules. Goods are still allowed to cross, they just have to meet the regulatory standard and any tariffs have to be paid. That can be done in advance, it doesn't have to be done at the border.

&gt;The UK may leave in some fictional reality where this is true, but Ireland is in the EU and the UK won't be, so if there is no deal, there will HAVE to be a border.

Who is going to build  a hard border? The UK and the EU will both have a requirement to enforce their customs rules. But the UK hasn't and won't build a hard border, and nor will Ireland. So the solution, whether deal, no-deal or something else will be cross border cooperation and off-border checks. The options for the UK and EU are whether they cooperate and minimise the amount of effort and work required, or whether they don't, in which case they both have to put in what they feel is sufficient.

Again, can you see Ireland building a physical border? I can't. the UK won't for the same reasons, and the EU can't because it doesn't have the power to do so.

""LFTR produces electricity cheaper than from coal

Small, modular LFTRs can be factory-produced. Capital costs for LFTR electric power plants can be about $2/watt.

&gt; Now is 4 lane highway with a 140 km/h speed limit. And if there is no highway yet, then its being built.

That's not true, unfortunately. The highway A1 is currently available from the Upper Silesian metropolis up to the Katowice airport. The part from the airport up to Czƒôstochowa is currently under development and the subsequent part to Piotrk√≥w Trybunalski has not even been started yet.

We had major successes in this area in the last 10 years, I absolutely agree with that. Unfortunately, we still have a lot to do in this area and the focus on roads meant that the government was paying much less attention to our railroads that suffer from over thirty years of improper management and lack of upgrades.

Map with our high-speed roads - finished, currently being built, late and early stages of design and finding a contractor. This does not include roads that are planned but are not currently in the process of obtaining environmental analysis and necessary permits. For example, you can easily see that for some of expressways, such as S10, S11 or S16, currently we have only few bypasses at major cities. http://ssc.siskom.waw.pl/",Poland,/r/europe/comments/azjzxc/since_the_fall_of_communism_30_years_central_and/ei9yrwx/,yarpen_z,1552313016

4395,"&gt;The point is that the backstop keeps the UK in the customs union, thus making it a ""softer"" Brexit, at least in his opinion.

The backstop creates a customs territory, it's a little more complex than keeping the UK in the customs union. But again, its temporary and the parent didn't say 'softer' brexit, he said that it resulted in no-brexit. I'm not sure that under any circumstances you could claim that the UK being in a temporary situation closer to the EU/Turkey situation than most others could be seen as no-brexit (And there are leave voters who advocate remaining in a customs union..

&gt; The EU would also be reluctant to cancel the backstop in the absence of an agreement that keeps at least NI in the customs union and aligned with single market regulation.

Yes, and that is the fear from the UK side (that the EU would draw out the transition into the backstop to try and 'capture' NI in some way). I agree there are some issues there, but again, it's hard to call that the UK not leaving the EU.

&gt;The argument therefore would be that the withdrawal agreement prevents a ""hard"" Brexit, taking the entire UK out of the single market and the customs union (unless of course both sides can agree on a customs check regime that doesn't require any checks at the border).

Again, even with the backstop, the UK leaves the single market, the four freedoms fall away and are replaced with some free movement of goods..  And that still doesn't come close to being no-brexit. Indeed for a lot of remainers that's a hard brexit ('soft' brexit being remaining in the SM and CU etc..).

_Winston Churchill, a former army officer, war reporter and British Prime Minister (1940-45 and 1951-55), was one of the first to call for the creation of a ‚ÄòUnited States of Europe‚Äô. Following the Second World War, he was convinced that only a united Europe could guarantee peace. His aim was to eliminate the European ills of nationalism and war-mongering once and for all._

_He formulated his conclusions drawn from the lessons of history in his famous ‚ÄòSpeech to the academic youth‚Äô held at the University of Zurich in 1946:_

‚ÄúThere is a remedy which ... would in a few years make all Europe ... free and ... happy. It is to re-create the European family, or as much of it as we can, and to provide it with a structure under which it can dwell in peace, in safety and in freedom.

As to why I see recession as a problem, it's because when you are in a recession it's not really politically astute to refuse reasonable trade deals with major export markets.


 Also the EU is not well placed to weather a recession now anyway, with the fairly damaging austerity inflicted upon many of the weaker economies meaning that recovery from the previous recession has been weak. Again, statement of fact, not of enjoyment. 

What does a central bank do to deal with a recession? Step 1, cut interest rates. Step 2. Quantitative easing (print money to buy government bonds). That has been the classic response for practically every central bank in times of recession.

The ECB's base rate is 0%. There's literally nothing left to cut. As to quantitative easing, the ECB stopped at the end of December. 

The eurozone is barely out of the 'emergency damage control' phase of the last crisis. Another recession now is not healthy, and piling additional negative stimuli (for example, losing significant access to a major export market) could easily turn crisis into disaster.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/azhxi5/the_eus_secret_brexit_negotiation_exposed/ei9rruz/,Rulweylan,1552306150

&gt; Do you really think the environment should be ""protected"" just because it has value of its own? Even at the cost of human welfare?

I have a personal interest in having a climate that is not a hellscape.

&gt; Do you really believe government compelled regulation comes at no cost and does not impact anyone's life?

No, only idiots would think that there won't be *any* impact, and likewise  other idiots would think environmentalists would think that.

&gt; If the free market reflects that people don't care about the ""environment"", what makes you think your opinion is more important than those people's expressing their opinions peacefully?

Again, because I have a personal interest in having a liveable environment. If other people are willing to fuck that up, I can't do much about that except make my voice heard and spread awareness that in the end, this is in everyone's interest.

&gt; When you remove the profit incentive, however way you would, what would compel people to produce? And how would you do this, without terrorizing people to the core?

Production based on the principle of need instead of profit-motive. There's a lot of literature on this and I can suggest starting [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Production_for_use)

&gt; The price system is pretty flexible. What makes you think it won't solve any potential challenges in the next few decades?

I'm not sure what price system you're referring to right now, sorry. (I'll amend if it becomes clear to me)

&gt; How do you plan to resolve the tension between a desire to improve human welfare and minimise negative impact externally?

I think we can have reasonable living standards *and* be environmentally concious. This *will* mean we'll have to give up some of our luxuries(eg. flying all over the world) up here in the west until we can do the same with less of a footprint. 

Right now a large part of the lack of welfare is because of inequality. Those at the very top(and yes, I am aware a large part of the western population is part of that top) consume and pollute at an order of magnitude bigger compared to the global average. So combined with some proper redistribution I do believe we can all live fulfilling lives without economic uncertainty in a environmentally friendly way.",,/r/europe/comments/azg7ci/35000_people_in_amsterdam_protesting_dutch/ei9mi59/,Lower_Blacksmith,1552298574

### Slough

Come friendly bombs and fall on Slough!  
  It isn't fit for humans now,   
  There isn't grass to graze a cow.   
  Swarm over, Death!  
 

 Come, bombs and blow to smithereens  
  Those air -conditioned, bright canteens,   
  Tinned fruit, tinned meat, tinned milk, tinned beans,   
  Tinned minds, tinned breath.  

 Mess up the mess they call a town-  
  A house for ninety-seven down  
  And once a week a half a crown   
  For twenty years.  

 And get that man with double chin  
  Who'll always cheat and always win,   
  Who washes his repulsive skin   
  In women's tears: 

 And smash his desk of polished oak  
  And smash his hands so used to stroke  
  And stop his boring dirty joke  
  And make him yell.  

 But spare the bald young clerks who add  
  The profits of the stinking cad;  
  It's not their fault that they are mad,   
  They've tasted Hell.  

 It's not their fault they do not know   
  The birdsong from the radio,   
  It's not their fault they often go   
  To Maidenhead 

 And talk of sport and makes of cars  
  In various bogus-Tudor bars   
  And daren't look up and see the stars  
  But belch instead.  

 In labour-saving homes, with care  
  Their wives frizz out peroxide hair  
  And dry it in synthetic air  
  And paint their nails.  

 Come, friendly bombs and fall on Slough  
  To get it ready for the plough.  
  The cabbages are coming now;  
  The earth exhales.

4563,"It wouldn't, I was trolling a bit.. But since you ask:   
Every nationality has a character with virtues and flaws (the stereotypes do come from somewhere after all), but the Danish one is not very obvious until you've lived there long enough. I won't say all the nice things that are true of Danes, and there are plenty, so keep in mind this is a skewed picture.   


Tall-poppy syndrome: Danish society is all about equality and community, to the point where standing out in any way is punished. The pressure to conform is enormous. People talk about the same things, wear the same clothes, think the same thoughts. If you try to be better at something, you will be cast out; Danish children are taught that it's not ok to strive for excellence, and the few remarkable Danes whose ambition survives long enough that they become successful, often move abroad because they can't stand the hate.  


Passive-aggression: The way to do conflict resolution in Denmark is not to do it. That might upset the social order after all. So if someone does something that people have a problem with, they will be slightly colder towards them, hoping that the offender will notice it and connect it to something they've done, and change, without anyone having to say or do anything unpleasant. If you come out directly and ask if something you did bothered them, they will deny it, only to talk behind your back later.  


Friendships: Danes find friends in kindergarten, and often those same friends will be the best man at their wedding. You still have a chance in grade school, high school is kind of possible, uni is last chance. Finding friends as an adult is pretty much hopeless, unless you join a sports club or similar. Passengers on buses and trains who don't know each other remain silent throughout the trip. 9/10 times, if you go out partying with your friends, your friends and the bartender are the only people you've talked to. If you do wind up in a setting where it's acceptable to mingle (house-party, job), Danes will be the most pleasant people you'll ever meet, and nothing upsetting will ever happen, and you will never get to know anything about them, because they would rather be tortured to death than reveal anything personal or quirky or authentic about themselves. A cynical person may ask if there even is an authentic person underneath - and yes, there is! There are magical moments full of wonder when Danes open up and exchange their truest thoughts. These moments happen between 3-5 am when everyone is so drunk that you can always deny everything you said and blame the alcohol.   


Blind obedience to rules: It doesn't matter why the rules were made or what they're for. It doesn't. Matter. If a rule has been set but circumstances have changed so that following it actually achieves the opposite of the original purpose, Danes will still obey, because the impulse to think for oneself and question authority has been thoroughly eradicated, if it ever existed to begin with. This is of course another reason why Denmark works so well; if you put up a sign telling people to do something, you can reasonably expect that it will be followed. In Denmark, you can set out a batch of strawberries/eggs/found golf-balls in front of your house, with a sign ""20 kr pr. batch"", go on vacation, and come back to a basket full of money.  


No moral backbone: Danes don't really do this thing where they consider how to act so that everyone is happy. They don't need it. The Danish solution to any moral dilemma is to get together in a group, like a union, familiy-gathering or a government, and set more rules. And the rules will be followed. This means that if something unexpected happens and there's a need for quick decision making, Danes are likely to freeze, think something like ""the government/police/teacher should handle this"", and walk away. They are the most caring and supportive people ever to walk the earth. As long as there are rules in place that allow them to be.  


If you're reading this as a Dane, tag det med et gran salt.. There are plenty of Danes who break this stereotype, and probably few who are exactly like this all the time. But it's kind of true nonetheless, and it's not something you'd talk about in Denmark (obviously), or outside of Denmark, since you don't see it from the outside.",,/r/europe/comments/azoj1t/quality_of_life_index_in_europe/ei9mjwk/,yldedly,1552298661

They are automatically _eligible_ for citizenship, the two are not functionally equivalent. Jus sanguinis, as a legal tradition is not applied around the world without condition.

After that will need to push to become this force of change on the international stage as well.

&gt; IDK, every way I look at it, the only worthwile thing to do is for the people to start leading the change themselves or to do nothing at all and just accept that we want the luxuries of modern life more than a clean and sustainable environment.

I see this as an attitude of inaction, and will not do *anything* if there's nobody to fight for the cause. Be it with protest, or with government regulation. The free market will not solve this IMO, because the majority of companies only care about profit and people care about little luxuries while dismissing or underestimating the strain it puts on the environment.

At the very least I'd like to see the cost of externalities into the production price, and the only way to do this is by government action because if even one company does not do this it will be at a major price advantage.

Devil's advocate here: so an employer has no right to make plans in case they lose a worker for a year or so AND they can't fill the position while that worker is gone?

How is the state responsible for what individual families do at home? 

&gt; no longer passed over for promotions because not a man

That usually isn't the only factor and it's really hard to prove that they are being passed over simply because they are a woman. 

They are less likely to ask for raises, for example: https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/04/women-are-still-not-asking-for-pay-rises-here-s-why/ and if they are less likely to ask for raises then we can infer that the same goes for promotions but I have not yet found anything definitive on that part. 

&gt;no more implicit notion of more competence for being a man

That depends on the field, though. Women can be just as good as men when it comes to programming (met quite a few female programmers in my country), science, and the like but I would assume a man is a more competent auto mechanic or oil rig worker because of how demanding those fields are when it comes to physical labor and the work conditions.

The French president‚Äôs clampdown risks putting public safety above individual rights

March 10, 2019 11:00 am by [Gaspard Koenig](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaspard_Koenig)
Quick, name this country: criticised this week by the UN Human Rights chief for using excessive force against protesters, its government has proposed a string of bills to repress demonstrations, dissolve dissidents‚Äô networks, promote an ‚Äúofficial truth‚Äù and suppress content on social media. Now its president is openly musing about appointing civil servants to oversee the media and control the news.

Welcome to France, home of Emmanuel Macron, the progressives‚Äô darling. The protesters, of course, are the naughty gilets jaunes, who could be individually banned from attending public demonstrations and put on a government watchlist under the ‚Äúanti-riot‚Äù bill that passed the French National Assembly last month.

The dissidents, meanwhile, are on the far-right. Mr Macron has pledged to dissolve their (so far lawful) associations. Freedom of speech restrictions are being discussed for vile ‚Äúanti-Zionists‚Äù to address a loophole in existing legislation that already outlaws anti-Semitism. Promotion of official truth is the inevitable flipside of the well-intentioned ‚Äúanti-fake news‚Äù bill that passed in November. And a bill currently being drafted only asks social media groups to take down hateful posts, which already happens in Germany.

France‚Äôs interior minister justifies police use of controversial ‚Äúflash-ball‚Äù anti-riot weapons by citing the violence displayed by the protesters. And Mr Macron told reporters that a new official press body would merely seek to ensure the ‚Äúneutrality‚Äùof the news.

Financial Times readers have nothing to worry about then: sensible posts and decent behaviour are unlikely to put us behind bars. Surely we can trust a moderate reformist government to identify the bad guys and protect good ones?

Well, no. The rule of law doesn‚Äôt work that way. Tolerating deviant, irritating or eccentric attitudes that do not directly harm others is the very definition of an open society. By attempting to define who is allowed to write, speak, tweet or demonstrate, Mr Macron risks further antagonising his disgruntled opponents.

By responding to every social ill with laws that soothe mainstream public opinion, the government exacerbates deeper tensions. It is also laying the ground for far worse abuses ‚Äî if not by this administration, then by its successors. Mr Macron‚Äôs claims to be acting to preserve conventional moral norms make him all the more threatening.

His clampdown on civil liberties is part of a consistent pattern since he took office in 2017. An October 2017 antiterrorism law substantially increased the powers given to police forces. A February 2018 immigration law weakened the rights of migrants and asylum seekers. In October, the French supreme court refused to halt the creation of a biometric database of detailed information on all French citizens.

Jacques Toubon, the ombudsman responsible for defending individual rights, has regularly criticised the policies of this government. Fran√ßois Sureau, a prominent lawyer and longtime supporter of Mr Macron, summed up the situation bluntly: ‚ÄúFundamental rights are under attack‚Äù.

Mr Macron is on a slippery slope towards a kind of ‚Äúdemocratic despotism‚Äù familiar to readers of Alexis de Tocqueville. It places general welfare and public safety above individual rights. This reflects a worrying global tendency of liberal democracies to borrow the modus operandi of autocracies.

We cannot be complacent. Prohibiting obnoxious content on social media is censorship. Gathering biometric data is surveillance. Locking up potential offenders before they commit any crime is repression. Wounding demonstrators is state-sponsored violence, and imposing neutrality in newsrooms is authoritarianism. Citizens should resist the impulse to impose virtue by force.

4842,"So, I'm in general agreement with the *if a business fails, let it die* principle.  The assumption that businesses are expendable is intrinsic to capitalism working efficiently.

But my understanding is that the basic issue that is raised is *can a series of bank failures translate into an ever-increasing-in-scale cascade of failures*?

Banks engage in [fractional-reserve lending today](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional-reserve_banking):

&gt; Fractional-reserve banking is the common practice by commercial banks of accepting deposits, and making loans or investments, while holding reserves at least equal to a fraction of the bank's deposit liabilities.[1] Reserves are held as currency in the bank, or as balances in the bank's accounts at the central bank. Fractional-reserve banking is the current form of banking practiced in most countries worldwide.[2]

However, if a bank sees a run, that causes the money supply to contract.  If that means that now other banks are not trusted to have sufficient reserves, then they can collapse.  And you wind up with debts all over that cannot be serviced, and the economy freezes up.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_run

&gt; A bank run (also known as a run on the bank) occurs when a large number of people withdraw their money from a bank, because they believe the bank may cease to function in the near future. In other words, it is when, in a fractional-reserve banking system (where banks normally only keep a small proportion of their assets as cash), a large number of customers withdraw cash from deposit accounts with a financial institution at the same time because they believe that the financial institution is, or might become, insolvent; they keep the cash or transfer it into other assets, such as government bonds, precious metals or gemstones. When they transfer funds to another institution, it may be characterized as a capital flight. As a bank run progresses, it generates its own momentum: as more people withdraw cash, the likelihood of default increases, triggering further withdrawals. This can destabilize the bank to the point where it runs out of cash and thus faces sudden bankruptcy.[1] To combat a bank run, a bank may limit how much cash each customer may withdraw, suspend withdrawals altogether, or promptly acquire more cash from other banks or from the central bank, besides other measures.
&gt;
&gt;A banking panic or bank panic is a financial crisis that occurs when many banks suffer runs at the same time, as people suddenly try to convert their threatened deposits into cash or try to get out of their domestic banking system altogether. A systemic banking crisis is one where all or almost all of the banking capital in a country is wiped out.[2] The resulting chain of bankruptcies can cause a long economic recession as domestic businesses and consumers are starved of capital as the domestic banking system shuts down.[3] According to former U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke, the Great Depression was caused by the Federal Reserve System,[4] and much of the economic damage was caused directly by bank runs.[5] The cost of cleaning up a systemic banking crisis can be huge, with fiscal costs averaging 13% of GDP and economic output losses averaging 20% of GDP for important crises from 1970 to 2007.[2]

-Krakow was not a hansa city. It was loosely associated with it, because its location it traded along the Vistula to Gdansk, a hansa city. It payed no hansa membership fees or sent representativs

-German architecture? Dutch architecture? Architecture in Europe was not trademarked or patented by any individual country, The styles were widespread, they are Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque, Classical, Manarerist etc. It was often exported by immigrants, and when the locals adopt a certain style they add thier own influence to it and it becomes theirs. Such as Reneissance wich originated in Italy and the Dutch Renaissance  style was brought to Gdansk by Dutch immigrants. Specifically during Reneissance the architecture in Europe radiated from Italy and was brought to Poland by Italian Architects, from this developed Polish Baroque. Much of Midieval Poland was destroyed by Mongol and Sweedish invasion, therefore alot of Polish architecture (Architecture in Poland) is Italian influenced, so where did you get this German or Dutch from? In case you have not noticed there are not that many spires in Poland as opposed to Netherlands or Germany.
Did you even know the German King traveled to France and decided they would build Building like those in France?

-Poles were absolutely not the minority. Already in the 14th century 5000 Poles 3500 Germans. And as Polonization started more and more of the Germans Polonised. Please cite where you get the idea that Poles were a minority for most of history.
Secondly, in the Middle ages German nationality was non existent what is recorded in History as German is based on language which says nothing about thier loyalty or sense of belonging. The official language of Danzig was German and yet in 1812 the city petitioned the Prussian government to let Danzig be annexed by Poland. So can you objectively assume all the German speakers were not Polish? It is true that there were many Immigrants there but that's like Italians and Poles taking credit for New York and Mexicans taking credit for Los Angeles. Krakow was the center of Polish culture.

-
 &gt;but they did little to develop it.

This is being objective? 

&gt;As the city of Krak√≥w began to expand further under the rule of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the new architectural styles also developed. Much of the urban-planning beyond the walls of the Old Town was done by Polish architects and engineers trained in Vienna(wiki)

4863,"&gt; We shall end this screwed EU and do the things our way, as we used to.

Then you'll either have to:

* Start over from scratch.  It took many decades to get the EU to where it was, and while some things might persist (product standards across member states, letting compatible goods exist), probably a lot of work would need to be done over again.

* Go it alone and suffer the limitations of smaller scale.  That's a fundamental limitation that touches on a lot of things.

I could see a *Great Reorganization* of the EU, say.  But burning it down because of frustration does not seem wise to me.  Sure, it's got warts, just like France does and China does and Zimbabwe does, and ‚Äî much as it pains me to admit it ‚Äî the US does.  But is it worse than a lot of disconnected nation-states?

I would not want the US to break up.  So I'm pretty sure that there's a form of the EU where you would not want it to break up.

The EU has been around in some sort of form since the Treaty of Rome.  Its creators are dead now.  It is longer-lived than one irritating set of leaders or one annoying administration or one crisis.  Whatever policy has been adopted today will probably not be there tomorrow.

And if you split up, then it's not like the other members vanish.  They're still there, just now not working together closely any more.  For a lot of time prior to WW2, many of them were working rather in opposition to each other.  Is what happened then better than what happens now?

And remember that France, in turn, does things that drive other members batty.  The UK and Germany, I suspect, probably are not keen on subsidizing farms and dealing with high agricultural tariffs, a policy that benefits France.  I am sure that every member does some things that are annoying and has to put up with things that are annoying.  Czechia is infuriated over gun policy.  Poland is irate over other countries trying to place African migrants on her soil.  There's give-and-take in any relationship.  I do not believe that France is the most-terribly-disadvantaged member in the EU.  And while there are things that I do not like about the EU and even some that are concerning, I'd take it over *no* EU, if I lived in Europe.

Would you break up France today?  Because I think that the building of France was probably not a painless process at all.

4864,"Correct: the earlier part of article 13, which you didn't quote, contradicts the later part the refers to that other directive. Though that directive about general monitoring is generally thought to mean there is no obligation to monitor for general crimes. Not that it makes an upload filter for specific content impossible.

Also note another part you didn't quote: the upload filter must make it impossible to reupload content taken down... But it also says that certain uses like parody or critique are exempt. This is contradictory. If reuploading of some content is forbidden, then you cannot parody anything that has been taken down before. In fact, it specifically makes it impossible to use parody to mock wrongful take downs.

So why has this not been tossed into the garbage? My guess is because this grey area is exactly the point. The big sites will impose upload filters, and then there can be a long 8 year appeal process to try and get the directive and the local laws overturned...

As such, she bears political responsibility for her decisions and the fact that she's still in office is reflective of the general attitudes of Germany. Attempting to equate that with an occupational regime colonizing a conquered state teeters on absurdity. 

The issue is that the majority of the russian minority came here as conquerers within the context of Soviet occupation - in other words, they came here to benefit from the political subjugation of the local peoples and to russify the region. They did not come here to become ""estonians"" in the national, cultural and linguistic sense of the word.  Granted, the average migrant probably didn't come here with that express purpose - they mostly came here to seek a better life, but by doing so they nevertheless contributed to the occupation and became its titular beneficiaries. The mere accident of the Soviet Union collapsing doesn't make them estonians, unless you have a very trivial definition of the term. 

&gt;However you didn't answer my question, how would it be beneficial for Estonia to lose 25% of its population other than tingling the vanity of ethno nationalists?

If the russian minority left, it would reduce the influence of the Russian Federation on the country, it would remove the *casus belli* used by Putin's regime to invade Ukraine and Georgia (protecting russians), it would get rid of substantial political opposition to NATO and the EU (which are considered indispensable security guarantees against returning russian domination), it would directly increase the utility of the estonian language etc. 

There are clear political benefits to them leaving. Obviously nobody is going to deport them, even though it could have been done in accordance with the Geneva convention as a policy of decolonization.

The backstop itself does not need to be permanent. It's also not that what the EU really wants. But: as long the UK is on some kind of self-discovery-tirp it's difficult. 

&gt;Well.. It is.. I mean yes, most of the Government sit in Parliament, but it's not like the Government can push parliament to do something it doesn't want to do in most areas.

Agree.

&gt;And also not getting support from anyone else, so its stuck.

Well, the problem is: Mays deal is a compromise. Both sides do not like it. Remainers do not like it because it's still leaving the EU. Brexit-Extremists do not like it because they want a hard brexit breaking all ties with EU and the deal is too much commitment. 

I completely understand Remainers who do not support the deal: Brexit is stupid idea. The deal is just damage reduction. But: Why reduce damage if it can be avoided at all. Well, it does not make any sense to think about the hardcore-brexiters because they are just nationalists. But finally it might happen that some remainers still accept the deal: Better a bad damage reducing deal than letting the hardcore-brexisters blow up the country. And even some hardcore-brexiters might accept it because I think most of them play poker: ""We try to look at insane as possible because we expect the EU to give in"". They might finally accept it because they know that no-deal is the worst outcome. And some of them who do not realize it might realize that no-deal could also cause a second referendum with Brexit cancelled.

4920,"In regards to the ""Germans""  at the northern border of what is today Czechia: Thats ""Sudetenland"", handle the term with care though.

They are the for our purposes here its the formerly German (speaking) dominated regions of [Bohemia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohemia). Bohemia was ruled by the Austrians Habsburger monarchs (starting in the 16th Century). This led to incidental but also very much also intentional germanization of Bohemia and a decline of Czech culture and language. The 30 year war and the plague leading to the death of 70% of the population and resettlement being predominantly done by (German speaking) Austrians contributed to that, as did German being taught in school, being the official language and so on. There was a [Czech National Revival Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_National_Revival) in the 18th and 19th Century (not entirely surprising when you look at nationalism also becoming a thing for example in Germany at the same time, partly due to French occupation of German territories there)  which failed in its goals but still gained significant ground. That movement failed to archive autonomy for Bohemia (one of the many similar revolutions of 1848). In 1867 the [Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austro-Hungarian_Compromise_of_1867) created, well, the Austro-Hungarian Empire (raising Hungary from a subject of to a co-monarchy of Austria), the Czechs failed to make it Austria-Hungary-Bohemia (giving Bohemia the same autonomy Hungary had gained it before) two years later. The end of WW1 lead to the collapse of Austria-Hungary and Czechoslovakia was formed, it was liberal democratic but struggled as a country.

Following WW1 you also saw the before mentioned rise of the term ""Sudetenland"" and ""Sudetendeutsche"", used as part of [pan-German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan-Germanism) for a ""Gro√üdeutschland"" arguments, to describe German speakers and  the regions where they were regional majorities within Czechosloviakia. Following the *Anschluss* of Austria and threatening war, the Sudeten crisis, Hitler was allowed the annexation of the ""Sudetenland"" as part of the Appeasement policy in the [Munich Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_Agreement) of 1938. Returning to Britain from that Agreement Prime Minister Chamberlain famously announced he had believed he had secured *""Peace for our time""*, the rest as they say is history. After WW2 Sudeten Germans were mostly expelled (ca 3 million) from Czechoslovakia and the remainers (proven anti-fascists and useful workers, ca 150k) were later forcibly dispersed, in 2001 40k people in the coountry identified as ethnic Germans.

...I used the term ""Sudetenland"" above because that is basically the holistic description of those predominantly German speaking regions, even if the term has a heavy baggage. But note, that this map was created in the bureacracy of the Austrian Empire (see its significance in germanication of those same regions above), so its not necessarily the most neutral document.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/azljdy/ethnographic_map_of_austrian_empire_1855/ei8zskf/,Bekoni,1552269941

4926,"Cultures don't remain static. They change over time.

In 1900, and even in 1937, many Germans had extremely close connections with what became Eastern Europe. There were German villages next to Polish villages in those parts of Germany that were ceded to Poland after the war(s). The same was true in Czechia, and to a lesser extent in parts of Hungary and Romania. Prague and Danzig/Gdansk and Breslau/Wroclaw were large cities with ethnic Germans and Czechs/Poles living side by side (or at least neighborhood by neighborhood). 

All of that is gone now, and has been gone for a long time.

Additionally, there were significant connections between Jews in Germany and Jews in EE through Ukraine...mostly using Yiddish as a lingua franca. That's all gone, too.

It may have been the case, in 1900 or even 1937, that many Germans would feel more culturally connected to Czechia or Poland than to France or England. That is no longer the case, and it's due to changes in the material conditions of life (in the East and the West), as well as a conscious decision on the part of post-War Germany to orient itself towards the west. No pun intended. 

*Some* parts of Germany always were oriented westward - Bavaria, Saarland, B-W, and many Rhine communities typically had a close connection with France; Hamburg tended to have cultural connections with the UK, and S-H had significant connections with Denmark, including a Danish minority.  And this is the way that most of Germany went after the war.

Try using empathy and walk in their shoes for a bit. China wants new markets to sell its goods to, which is why it invested in roads, schools and hospitals. Giving Chinese construction companies work to do for cash and experience, and then making sure the markets they create are stable enough to buy consistently from Chinese brands in the future (e.g. Huawei).

What will China saddling countries they invest in with crippling debt accomplish? Turning countries into shitholes means they stop buying Chinese goods. The IMF/WB at least has a reason why in that they want the developing world to stay as extractive economies and flyover countries forever.

4960,"&gt;*What‚Äôs your point?*

My point is simple. The so-called ""debt trap diplomacy"" is nothing but a propaganda shitfest led by the US, while they hypocritically engage in the things they accuse China of doing.

You don't need to ""trust"" China on anything but serving its own best interests. And it's simply a fact that it doesn't serve Chinese interests to turn countries it invest in into debt-laden dependants that couldn't buy as much Chinese goods as they potentially otherwise could.

&gt;*It‚Äôs easy to refute your bullshit here*

If it's so easy you would've done it already, but you resorted to ad hominem bullshit because you cannot.

&gt;*I mean... if it is beneficial for IMF/WB stakeholders to do this, as you implicitly state, then why can‚Äôt it be beneficial for the Chinese to do it directly?*

Because the IMF/WB stakeholders (i.e. US with its veto power) are interested in other things as opposed to developing power China? China seeks to diversify its markets, while US seeks to quash its potential rivals.

4999,"So, I'll use yours' reply trying to make it ""clear"" about ""spaghetti Bolognese"":

First of all, thank you about bringing up Artusi, he was one of the firsts' to explain (in written form) how ""Italian's regional cousine"" still today works...AKA poor people/peasant cuisine ""evolved"" (close to yours French cuisine, aka ""simple"")... Today, in fact, France and Italy's cuisine, are rewarded worldwide... (let's skip for a second Japan...that is kinda close to ""ours"")...given ""tecniques"" apart (like, Spain in the last 20 yrs...). Worth reading Artusi's....

So...

&gt; Which raises the question as to where it actually came from.

..is kinda simple for us Italians; there are 2 type of rag√π, Bolognese's one and Napoletano's one (the last one is what Anglo-saxons calls ""spaghetti meatballs"").

But let's focus on Bolognese, [here, is in Italian, cuz the English Wiki version lacks a lot about it...](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rag%C3%B9_bolognese) how the OG recipe should be, amended in 1982, in Bologna.

First of all, NO ONE IN ITALY (leave alone Emilia-Romagna, AKA ""the OG Italian powerhouse of worldwide cuisine""... go check where Massimo Bottura is from, or Parmigiano Reggiano, or Tortellini, or Prosciutto di Parma, or Aceto Balsamico are from... same region as Ferrari, Lamborghini, Ducati...maybe Napoli with its pizza could raise a word with ER, worldwide speaking; OG foodies goes to Emilia-Romagna, hands down)... will use ""spaghetti"" for rag√π alla Bolognese; you must use hand made tagliatelle, no excuses. FULL STOP. Same goes for Lasagne (one of ancient tipe's of pastas, goes back to SQPR's laganum), hand made fresh egg-made pasta.

Using spaghetti with rag√π, it's a no-no, you just acting stupid...go back to McDonalds...it fits your food-behaviors...(no offence, is not about you... general speaking, ok?)

Rag√π alla Bolognese with Tagliatelle it actually come from and fits from Bologna, no need to ask ""where actually come from""... the question is, ""where the fuck actually come from spaghetti with rag√π come from""?

Is just a marketing prop, an invention, an idea....that is far far far away of what the original is... a simple, yet ""poor"" recipe coming from farmers/peasants, but fucking tasty, and basically easy to made...

Ofc, you need fresh-on-the-shelf ingredients, as usually in Italy (even if, this things are getting rare, but... this is another story), also, no garlic, another misuderstanding about Italian's cuisine; we don't use so much garlic...and even if we use it, we took it away from plates (I mean, would you like burping it after 2.5h with stinky breath??...GROSS, fookoff)

I'll leave you with a good YT channel that explains some ""quirks"" and  POV about Italy's recipes (i'm not the owner of the channel...but it is good...and has EN subs...IIRC)

[Link here - 1](https://youtu.be/jQkc_1pQd3g)

5040,"&gt;Well, the backstop (in the withdrawal agreement) essentially means the UK can't simply become a third country (outside of the customs union/single market) ) unless there is a solution to the irish border.

Well no, the UK becomes a third country (not an EU member, not in the single market), it does require customs alignment though. And again this seems to be acceptable to Government because it will (again, according to the EU and UK be temporary if it is needed at all.

&gt;So the withdrawal agreement already prevents a Brexit according to Mrs. Mays red lines (hard brexit + whole of UK) UNTIL somebody can find the unicorn that is the irish border solution outside single market membership / customs union (i,e soft brexit).

You really have to stretch the meaning of remaining to include the UK leaving the political project, the single market and everything bar something akin to the customs union to get to that not being brexit. Indeed that's a reasonably hard brexit according to quite a few remain voters..

5055,"I know about the 4th Crusade, but the Byzantines had conditions favorable to them and they still fucked it up. The main reason the Ottomans were able to pick off their Asian territories was because most of the Byzantine military was in Europe fighting their Orthodox neighbors. The Collapse of the Seljuk Sultunate had left the Turks splintered and fighting each other so it was less expected. They had a commander who was able to rally the Byzantine forces and successfully push back the Ottomans, but he tried to overthrow the Emperor and was subsequently killed. After that the Ottomans regained the initiative and went on to capture Thrace from the Byzantines. Hell, there's no record of the capture of Adrianople, it seems Ottoman mercenaries just captured it without any orders from the Sultan, so no one knows when it was captured. Everytime there were conditions favorable to the Byzantines, they kept losing because of infighting. The 4th Crusade is a perfect example of this. The whole thing started because a rival to the Byzantine throne had appealed to European Leaders to put him on the throne. The Byzantines eventually reneged and put him on when the siege started, but they spent all their money to pay off the Crusaders who barely got half of what they were promised. With no money, the Varangian Guard realized they wouldn't be paid and left the city, leaving it with no realistic defenders. The defenses didn't fail, the Byzantines just collapsed from within. 

There are tons of stories like this throughout the period, but the Byzantines just kept failing spectacularly. Everytime someone gets close to saving the empire, they get removed or killed. ",,/r/europe/comments/azge3e/fleet_of_mehmed_ii_was_unable_to_enter/ei8s9fh/,DangerousCyclone,1552263788

5084,"&gt;No, it leads to a customs border, not a hard border. 

That's what all this border discussion is about. 

&gt;How the customs border is managed will depend on what the EU and the UK end up agreeing on. 

Correct. But it's dishonest to say you want a customs border, but no border check (at least random). Without border checks NI/Ireland would become a smuggle route. 

&gt;In the absence of a deal (so no-deal) you still end up with a customs border, except its the UK and Ireland who are left having to manage the border.

No, not really, because Ireland is part of EU/EEA. It's not just a border between Ireland and UK, but a border between EU and UK. 

&gt; I can't see Ireland or the UK going for anything that looks like a hard border.

It will be kept as transparent as possible, but there will be a border. If the UK leaves withou deal it causes the situation which needs border checks. Again: That's not about passport checking everybody. It's about customs declaration at the border. 

&gt;Indeed. Although obviously if the EU can't get an agreement in place, then the issue starts in about three weeks, and again, it's the UK and Ireland who will have to deal with it (practically and otherwise).

Again: Ireland \*is\* EU. So the EU has to deal with UK. There might be workarounds like no checks between Ireland and UK, but then there might be checks between Ireland and continental Europe (wherever the shipping routs go). 

&gt;Right, which leads to a situation where a customs border is required three Saturdays from today.

Yes, unfortunately. So unfortunately the UK decision leads to a hard border between NI and EU/Ireland. The orginal proposal of the EU was to have the backstop just for NI. UK did not want it but proposed the backstop for whole UK. Now it does not want even that. At the same time it claims that it  does not want a border between Ireland and NI. Well. Dishonest.

It's pathetic how we got to this point. In Portugal and elsewhere media refers as ""investors"" to old pensioners with the 4th Grade who lost their savings in bonds they have no idea how they work. These ""investors"" are to blame because they took a risk they shouldn't have. On the other hand German and French banks aren't investors taking a risk. They didn't buy high yield bonds. Rather they ""lent"" money to Greeks. Funny how words work to set a narrative. 

The death of Greece though was indeed bad Greek politicians who think about themselves and not the country. They took bad deals that served Germany and France for short term profit in their careers. 

The saying is true ""If you owe the bank $10 million, then the bank has got a problem."". The Greeks had a good hand when they owed the most and could make French and German banks collapse. And these banks would have noone but themselves and their greediness and investment choices to blame in such event.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; So for example, right now if you upload copyrighted material on to for example Youtube, Youtube is not responsible, you are.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; But after this passes Youtube would be responsible, and could be punished if they do not take it down.

So, how is YouTube gonna make sure that nobody uploads copyrighted content? With the vast amount of video material uploaded every day, I doubt they can review that manually, without employing a couple thousand people who do nothing but review videos all day.  
Relying on the ""community"" to report it could also prove futile, especially if you think about private/delisted videos. I'd assume one could easily upload entire movies, not list it and share it only to trusted people - but if one of those gave away the link to law enforcement, that would result in YouTube being prosecuted.

&gt; basically companies younger then 3 years old are exempt

Does this only apply to companies, or to everyone acting ""business-like""?  
For example, German law has a duty to include contact details on your website, if you act business-like. That basically means nearly every online presence needs one, unless it's completely private.  
The web interface of my private OwnCloud server used only by me doesn't need one, as well as the single other accessible file on my webserver which is simply `&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Oo&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;`. If I ever attempted to post something like blog posts, I would need to include my contact details, same if I started to provide any kind of service, even if I don't run adverts or take any money.  
If that law affects every website older than three years, that could potentially take a lot of old forums down.  
Another example here: For a long time I was part of a online RPG community, that runs it's own Ultima Online Freeshard, and has a forum where people interact in-character and out-of-character. It's still active and now over 15 years old, and as far as I'm aware has ~150 users in total - the game and the forums are moderated less than ten people. The server is run privately and is entirely funded by the administrator and donations, which often didn't cover the actual expenses.  
If this law affects them, the amount of work done by these people would rise immensely, since they wouldn't want to be liable just because some people post stills from movies in one of the off-topic threads. Every single post and comment would need moderator verification, which would lead to huge delays between posting and releasing it, potentially even disrupting the gameplay. After all you would need to verify anything at all, copyrighted material isn't only movies and videos, but also books and even short stories. The increased workload leads to stress and the moderators could very well just quit, ultimately shutting down the forums and the game itself.  

And all of this even assumes that there won't be any harmful actor trying to get people prosecuted by posting copyrighted material on a website and notifying authorities about it. Which is pretty much guaranteed to happen, this is still the internet and trolls are everywhere.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/azek97/german_wikipedia_will_shutdown_on_2103_in_protest/ei8idd1/,Cheet4h,1552256053

Instead of making an ideological choice for capitalism or for socialism, we can make a pragmatic choice for one form or another of *social market economy*, which combines the advantages of the free market with the advantages of social protection. 

In the same way, we can make a pragmatic choice between all out neoliberal policies and deregulation, as advocated by the Tories, and a state-sponsored development of technological champions, as in France. 

If the free market and deregulation have had some positive results, that doesn't necessarily mean that more of the same will be even better. In fact, both have already gone too far in the UK, and changing times will require a change in direction. 

Thus, the departure of the UK will allow France and Germany to redirect industrial policy to adapt to a changing world outside the neoliberal straight jacket. The fact that both have a different approach just helps us navigate the *juste millieu.*

5205,"Just trying to follow your logic.

&gt; Personally, I think the solution is targeting individuals. Go for those with high polluting assets and make them pay out the ass for it. Own a private jet? 30% of your annual income, taxed. Yacht? Same. Earned dividends or capital gains over topics that are associated with pollution? 20% over those earnings, retroactive. Own empty houses? 15% over your annual earnings per house.

Property tax. But specifically, a property tax for the .001%. Not sure that the example you mention are directly pollution-related, but if this weeds out those five multi-millionaires that don't hire an accountancy team or a reside in a tax haven most of the year, then sure. Wouldn't make of a dent, but sure.

&gt;Clearly, these policies are not meant to actually bring money in, but indirectly ban ownership of any of the above.

Never mind. You sure you wouldn't try something with actual real-life consequences, rather than scare the buggers away? If you really want to get the rich, close down Schiphol Airport or something. Make flying so expensive that 90% of the population can't afford to take a flying holiday once a year -- and if you can, clearly you're part of the upper middle class. Of course, the roads will be jammed as people prepare to take their car, and we'll release massive amounts of carbon another way, so we'll have to do some more if we *really* want to discourage people from going on holiday. Time for toll roads?

&gt; the upper-middle class / urbanite elite

Not sure this is just an urban thing. Plenty of provincial businesses pollute. Also, I don't quite follow --- who are the elites here, the middle class or the people who can afford yachts? I mean, you talk about global wealth disparity. Pretty much everyone outside of a food bank or an AZC would be considered disproportionally rich on a global scale? Do we tax those people, too?

&gt; If they'd like me to contribute to funding climate change iniatives, I will only comply in so far as the rich being taxed, out the ass, on an individual level comes first. After that, I'll put in my share too.

So this is about you? Isn't the whole problem that everyone is putting their own needs ahead of the environment? Are you suggesting we should do a communist revolution?

&gt; Untill such time, I am onboard with the FvD's unstated policy goals: Fuck you and drown, randstad's narcissistic upper-classers.

5317,"The people who keep saying ""Carbon tax"" know spectacularly little about taxes and how they work. This will be pushed onto the consumer.

VAT, Accijnzen, Carbon taxes, all of them operate the same way. This stunning ignorance in what the tax burden of these policies actually looks like indicates one of two things:

1. It actually isn't ignorance - they don't care. This would imply the switch of the left being the party of the poor / middle classes, to the party of the upper-middle class / urbanite elite is complete. These people don't mind regressive tax increases, because they don't bear the brunt of it and it sounds good if you don't think about it too hard (""The companies have to pay, SO IT MUST BE GOOD!! Ha-ha!"")

2. The left is *completely* off their rocker, and has no coherent understanding of what their policies actually do outside of the intended, tunnel-vision scope. 

I believe it to be option 1, but let me make something very clear: I consider this a complete and utter betrayal of me/my ""people"", and I consider it complete treason and lack of integrity. I put people in quotes because my ""people"" are those I consider to be poor working class / lower-middle. Which, by the way, conveniently lines up with my earlier urbanite/rural split as well.

Personally, I think the solution is targeting individuals. Go for those with high polluting assets and make them pay out the ass for it. Own a private jet? 30% of your annual income, taxed. Yacht? Same. Earned dividends or capital gains over topics that are associated with pollution? 20% over those earnings, retroactive. 
Own empty houses? 15% over your annual earnings per house. 

Really, I understand the left has completely abandoned economic policy bar neo-liberalism, and I hope they understand they have lost me forever as a voter for it (I do not care to be ruled by the social policies that wealthy, elite socialites wish to be governed by in their bubbles of avarice - so how earth do they represent me?). If they'd like me to contribute to funding climate change iniatives, I will only comply in so far as the rich being taxed, out the ass, on an individual level comes *first*. After that, I'll put in my share too.

What? Man stop embarrassing yourself. Maduro's power transition was very successful. He has full control over the country and its military. What is bringing him down is poor economical moves and over reliance on oil. This is not a coup. It might become, but has nothing to do with legitimacy. At some point you have to admit you are just massively incompetent and uneducated on all of these topics.

&gt; How did you find those two sentences equal:
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;     Yes, people never start civil war in their country if they have something to lose.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;     there was no middle calss that the population was willing to revolt(having nothing to lose)

How arent they? Syrians were generally as well off as a person can be in the middle east. They werent eating dirt. Most of them had aparments, stable jobs and some education. They were by far not a middle class as we udnerstand it in the west but they werent in jeopardy.

&gt; they are not. Please, use your brain. Middle class in Damascus does not exclude poor rural people. The more free middle class could mitigate the issue by creating more workplaces for immigrated masses of rural people, who simply move to Damascus and had no job, no money and no opportunities under the Assad rule.

Oh yes it does. Because the uprising was started by the urban people. Its always the urban populations that overthrow governmetns because they are closes to the power where the office takes place. I think I read a study on this topic - for a revolution you need only about 5% o the country in key centers of power. What the rural people want is irrelevant as long as they are not in the city. And the 'rural people' moving is the argument thrown by uneducated westerners that think the Syrian civl war was a 'climate change' war. Because there was relative drought (objectively smaller than in former yeras) and some people moved to the cities it was them that triggered it... That is falsehood. The main coal for the fire was and continues to be the sectarian islamist movements inside the country and their inability to accept a Shia led government. The specific fire was ignited by the west after the protests during the arab spring. The huge flame was further fired up by money, arms and militia from foreign countries like USA, Israel, KSA and Qatar. If they didnt interfere the whole civil war would have lasted a month.

Use your brain.

Because it's the actual connection that creates the responsibility. Not towards the people who joined ISIS. But towards the rest of the world to clean up the mess we created. If they were born and grew up in the Netherlands then you as a society had a responsibility to bring them up right. You failed. Maybe not due to any fault of your own but still failed. If they have a legitimate connection with some other society then that society also failed and should bear a responsibility. But if the only other connection they had was a generation old blood connection then it's the society that brought them up that failed.

I don't give a shit about these fighters or their wives. They're horrible people and should be punished severely and from the view of strictly punishing them revoking their citizenship is fine. But that punishment should not include abrogating our responsibility towards the rest of the world to keep our shitty people in check.

5388,"I always love these posts: Yes, we consider it our birthright that we are able to see the planet. Because we *can*, and so we *work* to accomplish that goal. Perhaps it has something to do with living under an economic system where most of us are wage slaves, and time is an even more valuable and necessary commodity than money. We cannot afford to go slow, because we can't be away from work for more than a month. 

No, it's the over-indulgence of the working poor and lower-middle class. Anything to shift the conversation away from the wealthy few who are wrecking the planet on a scale 10.000:1 in comparison to the rest of us, eh? After all, only the rich deserve to be permitted the luxury of travel.

Good christ I wish there was something actual policy coming out to fight climate change without upper-middle class college kids coming and screaming blindly about some ""meh"" consumption taxes or how they can get by with less meat so everyone else should do it too! Honestly everything I'm hearing sounds like policy that belongs in the 1800s prior to labor laws being invented; most of the discussion seems to be had by people who won't even consider the wealthy as part of the topic. It's the working poor and middle class, the uncultured masses, the uneducated rabble; it's the same story we've heard for 5000 years. 

I have had enough. Climate change can burn the planet before I contribute to yet another solution that minimizes impact on the rich, who are the actual beneficiaries of all the harm that's come to the planet.

5483,"&gt;And your claim to being western is based solely on that you were in American's sphere of influence during the Cold War.

Yes that's a pretty major reason. Also, I'm part American so I can bet there's plenty of that.

&gt;And is Finland, which further east than Poland or Czechia or Hungary and which carefully tip toes between Soviets and Americans, eastern or western?

Finland is an interesting example for me. You are correct about the so called Finlandization policies having placed it somewhere in the middle. I wouldn't personally classify it explicitly as eastern europe but it's somewhat more towards that direction in the light of their stance. My fellow swedes and finns may disagree but there are so many factors you can throw into this that will affect different groupings to the point where it gets subjective.

&gt;And why is former East Germany and its cities like Dresden, Leipzig or for that matter Berlin never considered East European? is it because they're Germanic and therefore inherently western?

I sure as hell personally consider the former GDR to be eastern Europe. It was behind the iron curtain for a while and it definitely still shows in terms of development. Again there are people who don't reason this way making the delineation subjective.

&gt;They are linked to them by history a lot longer than the 45 years of Cold War. Why do people insist on pretending Cold War divisions are inherent and intrinsic as if they weren't based on Stalin trying to get as much land as possible for himself?

Because Stalin had an insane amount of influence in shaping how the world looks like today. The cold war didn't happen in a vacuum. The economic effects still visible to this day is only one of many factors why people draw the line the way they do.

Point is, everything east of the Azores is eastern Europe to Azoreans. People, countries and their respective educational systems will have their own subjective delineations based on an enormous amount of factors or the lack thereof that other people will disagree about.

The nazis were a wee bit worse than Russian imperialism...

Also the answer is imo to leave it standing there and leave some signs which show the right context. If neonazis come to jerk off to it, it's at least very easy to identify them as such. 

&gt; but I also think that such monuments should be not glorified either

If we apply moral standards we should hate most historic monuments with a passion. Almost all of them were built on the backs of a slaving population (instead of trying to improve conditions) or even had pretty clearly despicable motives (e.g. Colloseum). With Nazis it's relatively easy because most of nazi art wasn't very good either way (lots of kitsch and needless grandeur, can be impressive in some ways but isn't so artisticly spectacular). However with buildings like Olympiastadion or the Saarland Theatre, I don't think people would say you couldn't admire the architecture. Even some of the other more high grade stuff like the Braunschweig Academy for the elite of nazi youth or the Heidelberger Thingst√§tte are still in use in some ways.

5502,"&gt; Take your claims about Israel. Sure, their perfect world was one where someone else ruled Syria-but there are so many ways that it could be so much worse for them. They were hardly cheerleaders of the Arab Spring. It‚Äôs silly to just assume that they wanted him gone-yet here you are, insisting that it is truth from the heavens.

If you had asked for basis or clarification, I would have provided it. I am suggesting that it is a reasonable conclusion to be drawn from the available facts. I never asserted that it is divine truth, you have chosen to read it that way because for some reason you can't contextualize the rigidity of claims about international politics. It is impossible to rationally suggest it is absolute (ie: divine) truth, or on the level of a scientific fact. I assumed you had the maturity to presume this.

Back to the point: There are not many ways Syria could be much worse for them. Israel immediately benefits from a tumultuous Syria as a weakened Syria can't pursue any of its goals or aid Hezbollah like it could previously. It also gains from weakening the country by reducing the usefulness for Iran, as Iran was slowly creeping up its influence in the country. A regime change in favor of the sunnis would make ejecting (or containing) Russian and Iranian influence in the country much easier, which is why it definitely welcomed US and Turkish support for the rebels in the initial stages of the war. Seeing how Israel has always been heavily involved with Syria I think it's reasonable to conclude that it signed off/supported the American desire for regime change. They've also interacted most with anti-regime groups compared to anybody else on the ground. Various US think tanks (which are an admittedly shitty but as we're civilians, useful source) present arguments similar to this, not to mention various degrees and types of journalists and media people.

&gt; It‚Äôs just so common in places like Turkey that you can‚Äôt imagine anything else being true. It‚Äôs also true that the Middle East is a cesspool where such bullshit thrives.

I can imagine a great many alternatives being true, you had said nothing to tempt my flexibility so far. Only pushed your dogma and acted dismissively.

&gt; I also understood what you meant about the US and the government. It‚Äôs just dumb and irrelevant, as nations act as one on foreign policy. It doesn‚Äôt matter that many disagreed-the fact remains that most, and those who made the decisions, decided time and again not to push Assad out of power. Not to ‚Äúdecline to escalate,‚Äù or that other weasely-bullshit you posted up.

No wonder I was right about your bubble. US policy during the switch from anti-regime support to ISIS-containment was riddled with what seemed like an incoherent jumble of opinions and actions to the outside eye. There were public (by which I do not mean on CNN) arguments taking place around that time on the route to take, among various US military and security establishment types. The US has had this as a feature of its international policy at least since the post-war era (and even earlier, but that's too hairy to get into) where the size of the institutions make policy change at time chaotic and adversarial. Kissinger and his antics is the most famous and well-known example(s) of this sort of thing.

Coming back to Assad: That the US didn't depose Assad itself doesn't mean it didn't support regime change. The US is openly supporting regime change in Venezuela now but is not willing to invade. The two are not mutually exclusive.

&gt; Your point wasn‚Äôt nearly as clever or revealing as you seem to think. Do you think it matters that your Kurds disagree with what you‚Äôre doing in Syria? Does that suddenly make it not Turkey‚Äôs foreign policy?

If ""Kurds"" occupied a considerable part of Turkish institutions that draw up and operate these policies, yes Turkish policy would be different. In fact there was a month or two where the Turkish administration considered the option of sponsoring the PYD to separate it from PKK personnel, it was a long shot but for a while the idea was floated openly. Obviously the institutions in question ultimately rejected the notion. With a different institutional configuration things might have gone differently.

This does not change the fact that most large nations don't have what can be credibly called a uniform, singular foreign policy/policies set. Turkey also moved around a lot (how could it not) since the beginning of the war, and not solely for typical realist foreign policy purposes.

&gt; Get real.

You have once again typed up a post where you offer exclamations and insults rather than supporting arguments for your claims and are still realms away from actually engaging with the subject matter. Still pushing your dogma as opinion.

Which part is that of the directive?
If that is true, sure, that is good, but it also means pressure from two sides. What if the filter is too soft? What if it's too strict? Machine learning has come far but not far enough. This could ultimately mean an instance of manual review, and in the case of tech giants, that is good (One of the reasons ContentID is garbage is the lack of a third party reviewing claims). Again though, the proportionality clause is up to interpretation and it could mean an economic burden for smaller service providers as well. If they are not based here, they might pull out of Europe.

It will restore your honour, 
make you feel proud, 
protect your house, 
give you a job, 
clean up the neighbourhood, 
remind you of how great you once were, 
clear out the venal and the corrupt, 
remove anything you feel is unlike you...

An operation of that scale was not palatable to both the American public as well as the American security establishment. The US (or any country) is not an amorphous blob. There is no ""we"" wanting something.

As for Israel, they wanted a more amenable Syrian government for a number of reasons ranging from the Golan Heights to the state of Lebanon to relations with Iran etc. Even current US policy in Syria is heavily geared toward limiting Iranian gains in the country.

&gt; Russia got involved in Syria after Congress declined to authorize the use of force against Assad. That was a signal to them that we would not get involved, and so they felt safe enough to do so.

The question is not one of safety but reciprocal escalation. The US effectively signaled that it wasn't willing to escalate far enough to spend American lives in pursuit of this goal. That does not mean the goal never existed. And again, there is no ""we,"" the US is not an amorphous blob.

5827,"&gt; The Basic Law wasn't 'handed down' by the Allies and just enforced by the German authorities. It was created by duly elected deputies of the German states, who convened a parliamentary assembly, drew up a constitution, voted on it and handed it back to the respective parliaments of the German states, which in turn ratified it.

Note that this is *not* the situation with Japan, where we did, in fact, hand down a new constitution.  Notably, a female translator attached to the team MacArthur had put together wrote a section on male and female equality; in pre-war Japan they were most-certainly not.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Japan

&gt;In late 1945, Shidehara appointed J≈çji Matsumoto, state minister without portfolio, head of a blue-ribbon committee of Constitutional scholars to suggest revisions. The Matsumoto Commission's recommendations (ja:ÊùæÊú¨Ë©¶Ê°à), made public in February 1946, were quite conservative as ""no more than a touching-up of the Meiji Constitution"").[citation needed] MacArthur rejected them outright and ordered his staff to draft a completely new document. An additional reason for this was that on 24 January 1946, Prime Minister Shidehara had suggested to MacArthur that the new Constitution should contain an article renouncing war.
&gt;
&gt;Much of the drafting was done by two senior army officers with law degrees: Milo Rowell and Courtney Whitney, although others chosen by MacArthur had a large say in the document. The articles about equality between men and women were written by Beate Sirota.[3][4]
&gt;
&gt;Although the document's authors were non-Japanese, they took into account the Meiji Constitution, the demands of Japanese lawyers, the opinions of pacifist political leaders such as Shidehara and Shigeru Yoshida, and especially the draft presented by the Constitution Research Association (Kenp≈ç Kenky≈´-kai) under the chairmanship of Suzuki Yasuz≈ç (ja:Èà¥Êú®ÂÆâËîµ) (1904‚Äì1983), which had been translated into English in its entirety already by the end of December 1945. MacArthur gave the authors less than a week to complete the draft, which was presented to surprised Japanese officials on 13 February 1946. On 6 March 1946, the government publicly disclosed an outline of the pending Constitution. On 10 April, elections were held for the House of Representatives of the Ninetieth Imperial Diet, which would consider the proposed Constitution. The election law having been changed, this was the first general election in Japan in which women were permitted to vote.

&gt; In 1946, criticism of or reference to SCAP's role in drafting the constitution could be made subject to Civil Censorship Detachment (CCD) censorship (as was any reference to censorship itself).[5] Until late 1947, CCD exerted pre-publication censorship over about 70 daily newspapers, all books and magazines and many other publications.",üá∫üá∏ United States of America,/r/europe/comments/az8m71/germany_more_rightwing_extremist_soldiers/ei72irx/,vokegaf,1552205579

5916,"&gt; Stalin cared about average person feelings while sending millions to die in Gulags?

Firstly, it was not Stalin who was in charge.

Secondly, millions were not sent to die. It was about 3 millions and people are yet to prove that their mortality was different from the one in Western prisons.

&gt; Socialist economy was abolished becase it collapsed.

It did not collapse.

&gt; You make it sound like it was working great and was only gone because someone ""abolished it""

Precisely.

&gt; Some people especially older ones look back at socialism as the good old days because they were young

I've been there before.

When someone young argues for Socialism - they don't know anything.

When someone old argues for Socialism - they are just looking at the past through rose-tinted glasses. 

When someone rich argues for Socialism - they don't know anything.

When someone poor argues for Socialism - they are just being selfish.

I think it's not age, or the status, or anything else that disqualifies people. It's just nobody can be trusted, if they argue for Socialism, eh?

&gt; and many whom were members of communist party thus recieved perks that came with it.

35% is a wee bit too high for an elite.

&gt; Such polls are useless , people will always complain

Sure. Only your objective opinion is correct.

&gt; Its not a joke

Yes, it is. You are relying on some magical non-existent ""Capitalism"", the one that was created by propaganda machine. You don't even know what Capitalism Socialists want to abolish despite pretending to be an expert on the topic.

&gt; Capitalism is about equal chances to gain wealth

Who defined it as such? When did it exist?

Socialists of early 19th century wanted to abolish Capitalism *precisely* because it was impossible for overwhelming majority to gain any wealth. People had to work day and night to get the barest necessities.

Situation changed only when the threat of violent Revolution became apparent and Capitalists permitted partial abolition of Capitalism. Only then did people get to experience that ""real"" Capitalism you talk about.

&gt; You will never become very rich in places like Russia or Ukraine without having government in your pocket, that is what holds back the entire country,

It's called Capitalism. It's textbook Capitalism. Exactly like the one Socialists always describe.

It is the Western ""real"" Capitalism that is a distortion (though, without Soviets to threaten anything, all achievements of Socialists are being rolled back and both EU and US will be indistinguishable from Ukraine soon).

Hitler as usual sat in the front seat beside the chauffeur, Breker and I on the jump seats behind him, while Giessler and the adjutants occupied the rear seats. Field-gray uniforms had been provided for us artists, so that we might fit into the military framework. We drove through the extensive suburbs directly to the Opera, Charles Garnier‚Äôs great neobaroque building‚Ä¶ It was Hitler‚Äôs favorite and the first thing he wanted to see.

After a last look at Paris we drove swiftly back to the airport. By nine o‚Äôclock in the morning the sightseeing tour was over. ‚ÄúIt was the dream of my life to be permitted to see Paris. I cannot say how happy I am to have that dream fulfilled today‚Äù. For a moment I felt something like pity for him: three hours in Paris, the one and only time he was to see it, made him happy when he stood at the height of his triumphs.

In the course of the tour Hitler raised the question of a victory parade in Paris. But after discussing the matter with his adjutants and Colonel Speidel, he decided against it after all. His official reason for calling off the parade was the danger of its being harassed by English air raids. But later he said: ‚ÄúI am not in the mood for a victory parade.
