108,"An average American school bus is typically about 9.5 to 11 feet high, around 8 feet wide, and from 12 feet to 40 feet long.^a

This means an American school bus at requires a rectangular tank it was placed on to be 912 square feet^3 to 3520 square feet in volume, at minimum.

One cubic meter is 1000000 mL. But if we filled the space a school bus takes by water, it would still be 912 feet^3 to 3520 feet^3, because we prefer not to use those confusing SI-based europoor units.

To heat 1 cubic feet of water by 1 heretical degree celcius, all you need to remember is the easily rememberable conversion of 1 foot is 30.48 centimeters and work your way from there.
If 1 foot is 30.48 meters, then a 1 square foot is 30.48 * 30.48 = 929.0304 square centimeters, and a cubic foot is 304.8^3 = 28316.84659 cubic centimeters, which is as we know, an easy to remember conversion number making SI-system pointless.

An American cheeseburger is 300 Calories.^b

912 to 3520*28316.84659/300*30 = 2582496.409 to 9967530

Therefore 30c is 2582496.409 to 9967530 in American cheeseburgers it takes to heat a American schoolbus of water by that amount.

For example, Legasov says all the control room engineers died so they can no longer give interviews to Ignatenko, but Dyatlov lived until 1995 (after serving 5 years for negligence). It also suggests the divers in the above photos were on suicide missions, when none died of radiation poisoning. And that Legasov and Shcherbina would live only 5 more years due to radiation exposure, despite only having arrived in Pripyat a few days prior, and not being exposed to anywhere near a fatal dose.

Also, they focussed on the failure &amp; cover-up of a problem in the ""AZ-5"" scram button process, but in fact the main problems were consistent failures by the team and by management during the safety test (i.e. manually retracting nearly 200 control rods).

187,"The license stuff: an IDP is not a separate license/document. It's basically an internationally recognized translation of your existing license. Usually, a provisional license isn't valid abroad, but this is a fairly gray area legally. If you can get an IDP on it, then it shouldn't be a problem. 9/10 cops won't have a clue how to distinguish between Australian licenses.

The car stuff: AFAIK it's virtually impossible to register a car in most of Europe as a non-resident. The UK might be different because their residency system isn't as rigid as continental Europe. But it is fairly pricey in the UK (fees, insurance, road tax, roadworthiness inspections/MoT). However exporting the car is an absolute nightmare - it will cost you way too much time and effort. It might be easier within the EU, but I seriously wouldn't bother. I'd buy a car from some John Doe, not re-register it and just abandon it/sell for scrap once leaving.

The visa stuff: you MUST get your Russian visa in Australia. You will not get one in Europe. Thus you will need to get either a private or business visa to Russia. I assume you don't know anyone in Russia, so I recommend the business visa route(these can be valid for up to a year). It's common practice for travelers to apply for business visas(white lies are the deal in Russia) because tourist visas are extremely limiting - you can get them only 3 months in advance and they're valid for a set period of 30 days at most. Keep in mind you're only allowed a maximum of 90 days inside the [Schengen area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schengen_Area), although due [some agreements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_requirements_for_Australian_citizens#Visa_exemptions_for_Schengen_states) that Australia has with a couple of countries, Aussies are allowed to stay longer in those individual countries. The problem is that this is virtually unknown and a border officer might give you trouble for presumed overstaying.

However, the point I was making is that people who don't know what the hell they're talking about have been making particularly bad decisions in the past few years that have led to the formation of huge issues in these countries, and the media and the politics that are defending these decisions have insulted, smeared and even in some case attacked their critics. The working class tends to be conservative voters while libertarians tend to go for whatever party defends free speech and the free market the most, and so it makes plenty of sense that these people would resort to leaving their usual party and go for a more ""extreme"" nationalist party instead.

Basically it's not about one side being stupid, it's about one side making things much worse and then intimidating anyone that disagrees with them, and the knee-jerk reactions that are coming out of this sort of behavior. They may not understand the consequences of leaving the EU, but they are certainly aware of the problems that were created specifically by pro-EU politicians and thus want to push back as hard as possible so things don't get worse (which could happen since they don't seem to be getting any better at all.)",,/r/europe/comments/bvvmw1/uk_are_you_ok/epux1a1/,quickupvote,1559518335

225,"All joking aside, no. We have a real problem in our country and it’s not isolated to the UK, we just happen to be the ones that have decided to hold a simple referendum on a subject that’s very complex and intangible. The Brexit referendum might have been about the EU but its been a trigger for a lot of issues that have been bubbling under the surface for years. 

There are a lot of debates and discussions about Europe, governance, immigration, sovereignty, laws, freedom, religion, race, work, work ethic, unemployment, benefits, healthcare... it’s endless. No one seems to be really looking at the big picture. 

We have a really divided country right now and after 3 years of craziness things are getting worse not better. Only today my own MP was calling for people to boycott a well known and well loved Italian, UK based, celebrity chef, because he happens to be a Remainer. I’m fine with open discussion and debate but to deliberately try and damage people’s income because they disagree with you is fascism.  

You can tart it up however you like but underpinning it all is fascism. If you can’t see it that way it’s because you’re blind, naive or stupid, I don’t care which. 

Our government is grossly incompetent to the extent that not only did they promise to deliver something that half the country literally don’t want, they didn’t even have enough support in their own party to deliver it. They held an election where they LOST seats but somehow took that as proof that they were doing the right thing. We’ve had mass protests and a huge petition against Brexit which have been ignored. We’ve had parliamentary debates and votes which have gone against the government’s will, including from with their own party, which have made no difference to the direction they’re heading. We’ve had local elections where the Conservatives lost a lot of Councillors, which also apparently was evidence that they’re on the right track. We’ve had EU elections where the Brexit party, headed by Trump’s mate Farage, essentially won, closely followed by a lot of Pro-EU parties, which again apparently means the Conservatives just need to push harder.

378,"&gt; China, for example, simply cannot afford to not export to the EU. Half their economy is based on exporting us stuff. Also, they are already getting their shit together because it is on their own interests: they are by far the world leader in renewable energy, and are electrifying their auto fleet by force.

They also planning and are already constructing a few hundret new coal energy plants and are completly missing their climate goals, What they say and what they actually do are 2 diffrent things. There are actually 1.400 (roughly 1400) new coal energy plants planned or already on construction worldwide and china is involved on building quite a lot of those 1.400.

&gt; Russia is too small to matter. China and India we can bend by ourselves. If we have the US on our side, everybody else will follow.

Dont underestimate the Russians, despite all those sanctions their economy is pretty stable, but more important is their role in the world and their influence over its allies.

While i think China can be somehow influenced i dont think its enough and i dont trust them at all, noone should. They say a lot of things yet their actions speak for themselfes most of the time.

India i simply dont know enough to actually even have an opinion on them.

I know too much about US politics to even dare to say we get them on ''our'' side realisticly other then them saying and agreeing on stuff but not actually doing whats necessary.

507,"**Germany**

1. The head of Germany's biggest party, the CDU, Annegret Kramp-Karenbauer (or AKK), wants rules for media while electioneering. The reason for this is the german YouTuber ""Rezo"" , who posted a 55 minute long video called ""The CDU's destruction"". It went viral and has 14.2 million views as of writing this comment. In this video, he criticizes the CDU with valid facts and a 13 pages long PDF document with sources. Later, Rezo posted a video again, with more than 70 other german YouTubers saying they should not vote for the CDU, SPD (social democrats) and AfD (right populists), which are the 3 largest parties in Germany. AKK said that this is ""Meinungsmache"", a fitting english description would be forcing someone to have an opinion on sth., and that this the reason the CDU lost 7.4% in the EU elections compared to 2014.
2. Andrea Nahles, head of the SPD, the 2nd biggest party in Germany, will step back as the head of the SPD. Her party lost 11.5% in the EU elections, which is the SPD's worst election result after WW2. The party has big problems on the inside and has been struggling to sort itself in the last years. Now there is the question of who will be the next head of the SPD. The former SPD head, Martin Schulz, or maybe the head of the ""young socials"" Kevin Kühnert.

In general, the EU elections messed a lot of things up in german politics. The greens could be the next biggest party after the next general elections and the AfD could gain a lot of votes too, but I hope not.

550,"&gt; Well I'm talking to people who don't want to help fight climate change, so if we also don't want to help the refugees caused by it, we're just letting people die.

I was always for fighting climate change. 

&gt;Countries are not exclusively responsible for their own citizens, as we live in a globally connected world.

Their foremost obligation is to their own people. We live in a globally connected world for a long time, this does not imply an obligation to allow mass immigration. 

&gt; It's not okay to see innocent people dying and callously close your door in their faces. 

Europe is not the savior of the world. It is a small piece of land compared to other continents and the native Europeans already are a minority in these present times of population explosion in other parts of the world. Every country has an obligation to save the refugees from their neighboring countries in case of war, not all those from across the globe who wishes to come to Europe. 

&gt; Doesn't mean we have to take in tens of millions of refugees, but we have to take some real responsibility

Which is fighting the climate change and helping those countries hit by climate change. But no mass immigration. And some countries really need to start thinking about cutting down their birth rates.

701,"&gt;It is a project of English nationalism. It has been driven by English nationalists.

It has been a position in the UK since the UK joined, it has been driven by a variety of notions, it is far from an 'English only' one..

&gt;Which is nationalism.

The rejection of the EU is not nationalism, it is a rejection of the EU

&gt;Furthermore, Brexiters don't think of themselves as Europeans (they've never had) and feel disgust towards the EU citizens.

I would assume that most see themselves as Europeans in a geographical sense, but don't identify with their EU citizenship as such. And I very much doubt that anything but a tiny minority feel anything even approaching disgust toward EU citizens.

&gt;This is why they want to brexit.

Largely they want to leave the EU because they don't connect with the project, not out of some disgust for EU nationals.

&gt;They feel they are better than other EU citizens and want special treatment and privilege. And they still think they are the owners of the world and thus don't have to deal with dirty EU citizens.

No, I think you are projecting hatred at this point. The UK asked for opt outs from the EU project, because it found it hard to support it. Instead of blocking change outright, it removed itself from them. That doesn't amount to a dislike of EU citizens..

&gt;Why the success of the Russian party then?

They were clearer about it, and the Tories hadn't delivered?

&gt;No, they will be eaten by the anti-EU and Pro-Russia nationalists of the Russian party.They will drop to sth like 5%. Their death is coming.

Probably not, and obviously once the UK is out of the EU, the BXP has no unifying issue anymore, and it'll die..

&gt;The party is pro-remain.Corbyn is not.

The party is officially pro-leave.

&gt;They are on the fence.I think they will finally kick Corbyn out and the party will officially be pro-remain.Or LP will die.

&gt; In the USSR, Estonia and Moscow lived the same. 

What does that even mean? One is a small country and the other is a giant metropolis. I'm pretty sure they never lived ""the same"". Estonia was mostly an agrarian society in the past, I'm pretty sure they didn't grow wheat in Moscow.

&gt; Now it is a country without industry, without population growth, with zero prospects. 

Just because there was a noticeable shift in industry in Baltics doesn't mean there's no industry. Sure, heavy industry largely fizzled after USSR, but a lot of consumer and local industry has sprung up instead. Estonia, for example, is a major electronics and wood producer, and exports 5 times more per capita than Russia. So if Estonia has ""no industry"", then Russia is what? A glorified petrol station?

The stories of huge emigration in Baltics are a thing of the past. Estonia's population has grown since 2015 and also grew last year (unlike Russia). Baltics also have a higher birth rate than Russia now.

And zero prospects? I don't know, comparing latest Russian economic growth of 0.5% to Estonia's 4.5%, which one is with zero prospects? The wages in Russia are also only half of Estonia's.

I mean, I wish the best for Russia and I'm sure you'll grow and become wealthier, but the bullshit stories about decaying Pribaltika and blossoming Russia just feels like you're still stuck in Stalinist times, you just make up fake stories about countries you don't like. I might not like Russia, but I'm not going to claim it's worse than Turkmenistan.

&gt; Why was it an occupation? What were the crimes? The communists are much more Russian killed and exiled to other republics. You behave as an opposition in Russia, throw phrases without real evidence. 

It was occupation because Soviet Union moved its troops into Baltics against the will of local population, by threatening the governments. After that, the governments were illegally disbanded, Russia faked demonstrations about locals ""wanting to join USSR"" (because sure, who wouldn't have wanted to join such a failed country where literally millions of peasants had starved to death, e.g. in Ukraine) and then installed puppet governments that then proceeded to ""join"" the USSR, when already hundreds of thousands of Red Army troops were occupying the country.

After that, the Soviets killed and imprisoned much of the former elite, deported tens of thousands of locals to Siberia, nationalized private property, destroyed and banned local monuments and symbols etc.

791,"&gt; Her therapists report that Brexit is shattering some EU nationals’ sense of identify and belonging. Some, who are married to Britons whose families voted leave, say they feel rejected by their in-laws and conflicted in their relationships, and find extended family occasions difficult to cope with.

Clearly voting leave doesn't mean that individuals within the EU are being rejected. Voting to leave a political union shouldn't be taken as a personal offense.

&gt; Before, people didn’t have a sense that they were outsiders because they felt they were all Europeans together. They might have been German but residing in Britain and they were able to amalgamate their identity because of their overall European identity but now their European identity is seen as negative by so many people, their ID has been disaggregated,” said Van Deurzen.

Is European identity a similar feeling to being American in the USA or Canadian in Canada? As there is a huge variety of different languages/cultures in Europe that easily distinguish the countries there between each other, which doesn't exist to the same degree in Canada or the USA. What I can think of with regards to a common heritage that's applicable to all of the European countries is EU membership and being geographically located in Europe.

896,"&gt;All forms of Brexit will put the UK in a worse position than it was before and involve many trade offs to get there. As part of the largest political union, the UK has unprecedented access to a large market and the ability to influence not only the EU but the rest of the world through power projection. By leaving the EU the UK loses this and those people are acting all inpatient about it are going to be very disappointed. 

That seems to be the argument that the UK has rejected, and arguably rejected for quite a long time. The UK would rather be a partner to the EU than part of it. Something that has costs and benefits.

&gt;As their world view is built on the lie that the grass is greener when it is clearly not and if they keep on believing that, I am going to think that they are delusional.

It's a nice narriative, it has kept the remain side hoping that they can shift things, but it's broadly false don't you think? The issue with the UK and the EU isn't that people have been sold the notion of a better UK outside of the EU (That was mostly an artifact of the referendum campaign), the issue with the UK and the EU is that there is so little support for the actual EU as a project. It's why remain haven't framed the EU as a broad positive, but rather something that has to be accepted, and should be reformed.

The problem is that people in the UK aren't on board with the project, they just about like what they perceive as the economic benefits, but beyond that? Not really.

&gt;Most people in other EU countries have accepted this, for example 87% of Spaniards and 90% of Irish people don’t think leaving the EU is a good idea but a decent chunk of the British population refuse to accept that.

It's subjective, if you object to the notion of pooling sovereignty with a slew of other countries, or don't like the direction the EU is heading then you aren't ever going to see EU membership as a good idea, and indeed in that context it isn't. It's not a 'refusal to accept' it's a difference in view.

&gt;I am not saying that Brexit in itself is a fantasy either but they way that it was marketed is. Both before the referendum and more recently, especially with the push for no deal by a lot of Brexit supporters who at the time claimed that it would be a pice of cake to get a trade deal. It is also not an insignificant minority of people pushing for this and many have quite a decent amount of influence over British politics.

The problem with that is that the peak of UK support for the EU was in about 1975, it dipped massively thereafter (for obvious reasons) recovered a bit in the late 90's, was ignored by everyone again as much as possible, then rose again in 2015, and arguably over the referendum too.  The message on the EU over that period hasn't exactly been consistent, it has been attacked by the left and right (not unreasonably usually) and frankly, people didn't buy into it.

In that context, what do you expect?

I agree that no-deal is a bad idea, but the only way to avoid that is by leaving with a sensible deal, that should have been possible more than a year ago.",United Kingdom - Personally vouched for by /u/colourfox,/r/europe/comments/bvoxe6/opinium_research_poll_brexit_party_overtaking/epsziyy/,-ah,1559475539

914,"&gt;These three giants, are going to be much more powerful than country number 4

The answer to that is a nuclear deterrent, you can be small yet be impossible to invade militarily.  Luckily for the UK at least, it already has one.

&gt;If the medium size countries don't band together, the giants are going to sit on us.

Only relevant if a country does large amounts of international trade, it may sound sacrilegious but a largely closed economy would also work well for any nation that can feed its people well, and has the aforementioned nuclear defence.  So they may not have Ipads, or they may have tech of their own name and making instead, is that such a terrible thing?

There is strong evidence to suggest that closed economies increase the happiness of a people that suddenly find they have to make their own goods, you could go from the majority in miserable service jobs, to the majority in industry and crafts, with all the pride and satisfaction creating goods brings, not to mention the uniqueness of their design, which has been lost to the generic, one-size-fits all, 'Made in China' brand.  It may even increase itnernational interest in their unique goods.

&gt;For me it's just a very simple thing, power is power

Yeah we know Tony, we know.  You can be friends with other European countries and help each other out, without having to merge into a huge political and social block, because it doesn't even guarantee good-will or good treatment.

But he didn't pull in much of a following over it through, immediately after the referendum he became largely irrelevant for at least a year. The catalyst was having the UK be part of the EP elections at all (people had expected the UK to be out).

&gt;The problem is tha Cameron offered a referendum with a fantasy ""leave"" option. It was inevitable that reality would disappoint.

The referendum was about direction, not fantasy anythings. Leaving the EU is a reasonable proposition, and the referendum showed a lack of consent to remain.

&gt;Using urbanization as an index of per capita income suggests that GDP per capita in Roman Italy was comparable to that in the late 17th century in England and Holland, the most advanced European economies before the Industrial Revolution. This very rough index is supported by an equally rough calculation of real wages, defined as wages divided by the price of wheat (Allen, 2001; Temin, 2005). It seems extraordinary that GDP per capita could have risen this high in the ancient world.

1138,"You seem to think that every officer in a district where some officers go free from crimes is *choosing* not to do something about it. Do you understand how such things work? The incident occurs, typically while responding to a crime which may be a dangerous situation. That situation is resolved poorly, and it's noted that this or that officer acted inappropriately, perhaps severely so. They're investigated, and they're let free by testimony from dirty cops who accompanied them at the incident, testimony from good cops threatened by dirty superiors (though I suppose you would say they should sacrafice their ability to feed their family for the greater good), or a dirty superior themself (although this is not always the case, simply google police officer convicted). At what point in the process are their other comrades complicit? Do you wish the ones who were not there to testify against them about an incident they did not witness? Do you want the other officers to re-arrest this dirty cop once he is released in flagrant violation of the constitution and justice system? What, exactly, should your everyday police officer be doing about these incidents? Do you realize that you don't hear stories about the vast majority of police districts, because there are no notable incidences of police abuse? Where do the men and women of those districts fit into your ""black and blacker"" chart of police morality?

I think the solution is to monitor all cops 100% of the time while they're on duty, with multiple independent high def cameras, and multiple high def audio recorders.  For every cop there should be another employee whose position is to monitor that cop constantly and make sure they are enforcing the law, including against other cops.  Any failures to enforce should result in immediate termination and criminal charges for corruption, and any attempt to avoid monitoring should also result in termination.  Any time a police officer breaks the law they should face a punishment ten times as severe as a citizen.

Punching does help. Now I'm not saying it can't be abused.

It's harsh, but what's happening to that person on the ground is to be expected and the police are just doing their job. The person being arrested is clearly refusing to put their hands behind their back, and does so for awhile. If you resist arrest, police will use gradually escalating force to arrest you and even in just the time of this video, with its multiple cuts between positions, he is resisting arrest for a long time. If the guy being arrested doesn't think he should be arrested, that's fine, he can fight that in court, he doesn't have the right to just tell the police not to arrest him and physically resist them. We don't know anything about the situation that led up to this or why he is being arrested. Clearly he did something as they aren't arresting all the other protesters out there, even the ones barging around police and filming (they have a right to film but it is dangerous to be pushing past police to do so). The longer it takes to arrest that guy the more dangerous it is for everyone involved, and the longer time resourced are being dedicated to one individual who doesn't understand they don't have a right to resist arrest. They say punch him in the kidneys because that is the short of sharp intense quick pain that will stop him resisting.

I found some experts of the link you gave and Fed was even less supportive than I thought, basically the only reason the ""help"" happened was that Fed was trying to keep the interest rate low while the Euro debt crisis messed that up.

Fed dumped dollar because of quantitative easing policy, not because it wanted to help Euro.

1392,"Thanks for the questions, I'll try to answer them as accurately as I can.

In this particular instance, it was a radio-debate called ""mads og monopolet"" where the radio host acted as the ""ordstyrer"" / moderator to ensure the party leaders would stay on topic, and then audience members would take turns getting picked out to a question to our dear politicians running for election. The moderator would then keep his eyes on the politicians sitting in the room with him for any raised hands if they wish to speak and then, at his own discretion, choose who should start off answering the question.

The things that are spoken about is... well all kinds of things, but mostly things that are related to ""velfærd"" / welfare - one of the values very dear to us danes. The question in my translation was a listener who wanted to ask what the politicians would do to ensure better conditions for daycare workers, and then after that I believe, another audience member asked about what the politicians would do to make it more economically attractive to work and gave examples such as the increase in years before you may retire making it less attractive to be on the workforce. Obviously, one of the economically right party leaders (Anders Samuelse, leader of Liberal Alliance) piped up and answered enthusiastically and talked about taxes and everything in between.

West jutes are people living on the western side of Jutland which would be [this-ish](https://i.imgur.com/HxCrIIy.png) part of denmark. They are seen as very rural / hillbilly-like.

Not sure why they tried to take a jab at the Christian Democrats since they are a *very* small party and have failed to get elected to parliament for [over 10 years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Democrats_(Denmark) but of their small voter base, the core can be found in western Jutland. If I had to guess, it's because the Christian Democrats are very humanist which Stram Kurs / Hard Line tries to use against them by saying they will invite immigrants into the country and treat them better than the good christian people, thereby fooling them.

1467,"&gt;No. There are literally hundreds of clips out there of people being shot. There were thousands. Google it.

If there are literally hundreds of relevant videos available you should be very easily be able to link or otherwise refer one of them. 

I especially asked because (a) there's lots of propaganda going around and it simply is to be expected that many of the available videos aren't exactly unbiased, and (b) exactly because there are tons of videos available, likely of various incidents, which I'm rather unwilling to search through looking for what you were claiming before. 



&gt;No. The Israelis are the aggressors.
 
Lol sure thing buddy, if only those evil, evil ~~Jews~~Israelis would stop their absolutely unwarranted agressions then the whole region would suddenly be at peace. There's totally no agression from the Palestinian side! Or perhaps maybe they are a tad agressive as well but then that's of course only because Israel started it!?! Right?!?! /s



&gt;They should stop their aggression and respect international law.

Wait what, suddenly respecting international laws is a thing over there? Please tell me how shooting fucking rockets and sending incinary bombs on kites into Israeli cities full of civilians either totally isn't against international law as well, or if it is then *of course* it'd still be totally different because Israel started it or something.

Protestors don't have to be Nazis or anarchists - and, maybe that's news for you but for most of the cases, they're not.

I don't like the FDP but I'm happy as long as they oust the CDU from government and finally change the downward direction of this country. As long as they simply do what any non-government party should always do in a major election ""we campaign for our own policies and not for X coalition"", Ampel and GRR will be the obvious choices by proximity of programmes. If asked about a black-green government, they should simply reply ""look at our programmes"". In general that would be a welcome change to german politics. In the Merkel years policies were practically irellevant. If they campaign on actual policies, the government coalitions that would actually make sense will crystalize pretty quickly (and Greens-CDU isn't one of them).

&gt; Guys and gals, we have a Left-Right divide, and neither side is strong enough to form a government. If not more people are willing to move from the Right to the Left, then the next government will have to be another Grand Coalition between the biggest parties from both sides.

Yes, we have a left-right divide but the AfD also is a right-wing party and not an immovable stone that makes all coalitions impossible (if they remain a no-no, there's always only a grand coalition left). In Denmark Vesntre, Liberal Alliance (both similar to FDP) and Konservativ Folkeparti (kind of similar to CDU) made a minority government with backing from Dansk Folkeparti (similar to AfD). The result was that Liberal Alliance tanked, Dansk Folkeparti tanked and Venstre and Konservativ Folkeparti made gains. In Germany the other parties should make clear that if the CDU wants a de-facto right-wing stagnatory government, they have one logical partner for this. CDU sells themselves based on stability and governability. If parties like the SPD and Greens would finally point that based on programme the AfD is closer to the CDU than the CDU is to them and a coalition is only possible if CDU makes massive concessions their way, then CDU would start tanking because their claim to a stable government is gone. If Greens don't get this memo they will ultimately go the same way as the SPD. They have to campaign on change and they probably will. If they then coalition with the CDU, they're the biggest hypocrites ever. Anything they say while campaigning is specifically only believable if the primary government options are without the CDU. On the other hand if they start pointing out that CDU and AfD are similar in their policies, the CDU will start to look like hypocrites.

&gt; but no one wants to vote SPD or the Left because they suck too.

I'm definitely considering to vote for the Left again. I would vote Green if they make an actual left-wing campaign, i.e. campaign on changing the Agenda 2010, campaign on climate change, campaign on EU (cue Macron), campaign on a capital M Massive infrastructure and education bill (including public transport and cycle infrastructure in cities), campaign on ending austerity, campaign on improving rural areas (the most useful strategy against rising rents in cities), campaign on federalism even. None of this is some insanse far left position, all of this is impossible with the CDU. It is however in principle possible in both GRR and Ampel. I'm sick of the policies of the conservatives, they destroy the EU and people don't even notice. Macron isn't some far left weirdo either, in fact most people these days think of him as right wing. The german government still effectively rejected all of his proposals... by ignoring them. In german we would call this ""Verarschung"". Greens have every reason to not coalition with the CDU and to pull this off they only have to accurately summarize what the CDU actually did (or more importatnly didn't do) in the last 14 years. Fibre-connections are practically non-existant (outside of SH - where the current Green leader was minister for digitalization), public transport is underfunded, most cities have poor cycling infrastructure, the gap between rich and poor is increasing, child poverty is at an all time high, young people increasingly find better conditions abroad, we're the 2nd most overaged country in the world (in large part due to child-unfriendly politics and economic angst - despite Germany being generally well off) and a significant portion of the EU thinks of us as their evil overlords.

Moreover, perhaps if the EU had more power than it has now, it would be able to more strictly apply the immigration quotas across the EU and properly ""distribute"" the immigrants. This, sadly, goes against the national ideologies who would like to see the nation states have as much power as possible - even if that means a weaker EU, and, as a result, lower European significance and economic growth. 

United we stand. Humans in order to stand tall and sturdy need to utilize every muscle in their body, just like the EU needs to be able to act in unison in order to stand strong.

AKK might have a point. There are some arguments in favour of establishing certain behaviours in the digital age.

YouTuber's are not different from you average celebrity who might write a column in a newspaper. They just have a greater reach and stronger impact than classic media, but that only means that the Conservatives have to use the power of social media.

1741,"I was mostly speculating and with a volcano as unpredictable as Vesuvius an eruption is always possible. But Vesuvius has a tendency to go dormant for some time after it reaches an end of a cycle. (The last one was from 1631-1944) When Vesuvius goes dormant its main vent will cool and get clogged. Meaning that for the next eruption it needs to build up a considerable amount of magma and pressure within its magma chamber. Depending how blocked the main vent is this can take up from a few decades to several centuries. The longer the wait the more devastating its next eruption will be. (Like 79 AD or 1631) 

As the poster in the above post explained incredibly well. Magma will not only accumulate within a magma chamber, but the longer it stays there the more it will cool and crystallise, which will also increased gases and pressure that have to be released eventually.",,/r/europe/comments/bvhigt/aerial_shot_of_mount_vesuvius_9_km_east_of_naples/epqqke6/,JH2259,1559410556

Abstention is not effectively the same as voting no: It is a separate voting option during the voting process, it is noted differently in the protocols, and it has a different meaning. I did not count the other votes but my estimation is that abstention votes are about as frequent as opposing votes. So if you would ask the question how often a country opposed or obstained then the total rate would be 2.6% (compared to the 1.3% only opposed). Countries not participating is a mystery category to me because the countries usually participated in other votes at the same meeting so I guess that they choose to not participate even though they are in the room.

This is where the argument falls apart, though it is cleverly constructed dishonesty. What EU did was talk about a trade deal with Ukraine.

The question's premise tries to pass off a false claim as a given fact.

The invasion was because Ukrainians overthrew an administration loyal to Russia, after that administration dismissed the trade deals.

Washing chicken in chlorine and other disinfectants to remove harmful bacteria was a practice banned by the European Union (EU) in 1997 over food safety concerns. The ban has stopped virtually all imports of US chicken meat which is generally treated by this process.

It's not consuming chlorine itself that the EU is worried about - in fact in 2005 the European Food Safety Authority said that "" exposure to chlorite residues arising from treated poultry carcasses would be of no safety concern "". Chlorine-rinsed bagged salads are common in the UK and other countries in the EU.

But the EU believes that relying on a chlorine rinse at the end of the meat production process could be a way of compensating for poor hygiene standards - such as dirty or crowded abattoirs.

Instead, the EU says the best way to eliminate the risk of salmonella and other bacteria is to maintain high farming and production standards.",,/r/europe/comments/bvj7f1/trump_administration_wants_uk_to_leave_eu_says/epqd1x0/,iamnotinterested2,1559403752

1974,"&gt;thus it bring us back to the point that they are just blaming russia because the missile was made there

This is absolutely not true. They are blaming Russia because the launcher was official Russian military gear sent to a rebel area in secret from Russia with most likely Russian officers operating it.

It wasn't just some ""oh, we're very sorry we armed some rebels"" but rather deploying Russian military equipment in foreign soil. The fact that the launcher was quickly sent back to Russia shows that it wasn't controlled by the rebel forces but rather by Russian operatives that were ordered to return to Russia.

&gt;but they have absolutely no evidence to confirm that it was indeed an russian or a """"militant"""" that operated it 

There is no reason to believe that Russia would just hand over their high tech AA weapons to some rebels with zero oversight. Besides, only a single country on the planet knows who operated the launcher and it's the same country where the BUK is currently residing in.

Personally, I think it's fair to say that military equipment that came from Russia and spent a total of 22 hours inside Ukrainian territory before being sent back to Russia did indeed have some Russian operatives using it.",Finland,/r/europe/comments/bv7vgu/russia_deployed_its_trolls_to_cover_up_the_murder/epq0nwn/,finjeta,1559396690

2033,"&gt;During World War II, he assisted the Armenian Legion of the Wehrmacht, the armed forces of Nazi Germany, he hoped that if Germany succeeded in conquering the USSR, they would be able to grant Armenia independence.

Heavily exaggerated, what he mainly did is present German officials with arguments as to why Armenians are aryans, so that in case Germany succeeds, Armenians wouldn't be totally fucked. There was another guy who was more related to the legion, Drastamat Kanayan, not Nzhdeh. 

&gt;None with the same rigor, reputation as Nzhdeh who is one of the most hardened nationalists in Armenian history. I know you have great respect for these ultra-nationalists. I know you well.

Calling Nzhdeh an ultra-nationalist is a hell of a fucking stretch. The guy ensured that Armenia still exists, with the Soviets being de-facto his greatest enemy, which explains the great respect to him. As for his military operations in 1910s, he is known for being highly critical of attacks on enemy civilians. That's not something an ultranationalist does, especially since it was during the Armenian genocide when the enemies did not follow the same views on sparing civilians. 

&gt;See Armenian genocide politicization against Turkey for instance.

What I see is quite the opposite: Turkey being a geopolitically important country, the countries that were themselves witnesses to the events refuse to drop the g-word just for the realpolitik. Looking at the US mainly. 

&gt;I've seen those Twitter posts and your politicians make them all the time also, even about Baku but that is just banter. 

Banter is when Armenians and Georgians claim they are more ancient than the other or were the first at X. The Armenian-Azerbaijani relations are far from banter. And I doubt that any Armenian politician ever called Baku an Armenian city, despite the massive Armenian contributions to its historical development. Even the wildest of nationalists and irredentists do not include Baku in the maps of rightful Armenian clay, the easternmost border I've seen is drawn at the Kura river. Even if someone says ""we'll take Baku"" it couldn't be treated as anything more than a joke by anyone. I cannot say the same about Azerbaijani attitude to Yerevan however. If parallels are to be drawn, I'd say Azerbaijanis claim Yerevan about as hard as Armenians claim Nakhijevan, if not more. 

&gt;The ethnic expulsion of Armenians in Azerbaijan was a reaction to the killings/expulsions of Azerbaijanis in Karabakh while the Armenians in Karabakh declared themselves independent from Azerbaijan. They could not tolerate their Azerbaijani neighbors.

Let's not forget that the first things that happened were pogroms against Armenians in Baku and Sumgait. The timeline is important here. The two nations hated each other's guts. There was even a lot of mocking and bad wishes coming from Azerbaijan when the Spitak earthquake occurred. 

&gt;Land claims against Karabakh, when Karabakh is already recognized to be apart of Azerbaijan... So Azerbaijan is making land claims against Azerbaijan?  
&gt;  
&gt;Armenia cannot threaten taking more land from Azerbaijan, especially under these circumstances it is absurd.

I wasn't talking about claims, I said land gains. And since Artsakh lost a few hundred hectares of land in 2016, perhaps they were referring to reconquering them back. Again, only in case of Azerbaijan attacking first. 

&gt;Dude, I see it all the time. They are still there. Lmao. Regardless of you having nukes or not, it displays your peoples sentiment about our people.

I never claimed the sentiment was generally positive. But the level of hatred among Azerbaijanis is way higher. Especially outside of reddit and somewhere on social networks, where the consensus is that Armenians should be exterminated.

2076,"&gt;A common complaint of those opposed to migration is that European workers have depressed British wages, but the report found that “immigration is not a major determinant of the wage growth experienced by existing residents”.   
&gt;  
&gt;There is some evidence that higher rates of immigration from the EU depressed wages for the lowest paid and enhanced them for the most highly paid. For the lowest paid — in the bottom tenth of the wage scale — EU migration is estimated to have reduced pay by 5 per cent in real terms between 1992 and 2017, but it raised pay by 3.5 per cent for those in the top tenth of the wage scale over the same period.   
&gt;  
&gt;But pay still increased dramatically for those born in the UK. Those in the bottom tenth of the wage scale saw their pay increase by 49 per cent over the same period. Those in the top tenth had a pay increase of 35 per cent. 

In other words, the poorest got compensated better for that decrease. Three times better. Probably with all that extra money the young EEs brought in to the exchequer? No?

&gt; Riiight.

What do you mean? How does that article refute the fact that Syria declared war on Israel in 1948 and as refused to sign a peace treaty ever since?

&gt; Moving the border just means the source of alleged military threats moves with it.

No, it doesn't. A hilltop has more strategic value than a valley. Area C are predominantly hilltops.

&gt; Israel has begun to colonize the Golan Heights with its own settlements, so can the international community expect annexation of Quneitra next?

I assume you would have preferred if Israel did not give the residents of Golan Israeli citizenship? You would have liked them to be living under foreign occupation more?

&gt; After all, Syrian artillery placed there could now shell Israeli settlers in the Golan Heights... Don't you recognize the kind of cycle this would create?

A syrian artillery battery at Golan can hit a substantial part of Israel. An artillery in Area C can target pretty much the entire of Israel. A plane flying over Area C can hit a building in Israel seconds after leaving the Area C airspace. Are you a thinking adult or are you just trolling?

&gt; Leaving aside your ridiculous notion of moving the border allegedly eliminating rather than simply pushing those perceived existential threats, or suggesting that Jews are unable to live peaceful lives anywhere else on the world just because other countries are not Israel, and your notion that Arab natives can just relocate to an entirely different country without issue, you make that sound as if you're already planning to annex all those 22 Arab states as well.

At the time. 1981 middle of the cold war and genuinly a risk of the US going to was with any nation with a communist government. 

As I remember the time. I'm pretty sure the nation as a majority would have considered keeping an eye on the growth of communism an important principal. 

I very much remember a general anti communist attitude in the UK at the time. And a very genuine fear that the US based in the UK would lead to us being a shorter target for Russian missiles if the US and USSR went at it. 

I was only 11 at the time but even for a 1981 11 to we were hearing about the fear of nuclear war between the US and USSR. We were also very much soaked in very anti communist properganda and the nation as a whole beleaved in it.

I'd also suggest. In a 2019 capitalist nation. With reduced spending on all of our services. 

I would be very surprised if MI5 considered it worth the cost or time to send some one to every single voting district in the UK. Break into a safe. Open an envelope. And photo 100s of sheets of paper. Then replace the envelope and forge accurately several signatures to a standard that the owner of that signature will not question it. 

With 650 different locations in the nation. That's by current standards. Possible but extreamly expensive for the small gain achieved. 

Of course I cannot and will not say it dose not happen now. But my logic makes it a large expense for a small or non existent gain.

2146,"Your government complains about all the overregulation by the EU? Or that the EU is dominated by a few big countries? They are lying to you! I collected the data from the [Monthly Summaries of Council Acts](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/register/en/content/out?PUB_DOC=%3E0&amp;DOC_SUBJECT_PRIM=PUBLIC&amp;i=ACT&amp;ROWSPP=25&amp;DOC_LANCD=EN&amp;ORDERBY=DOC_DATE+DESC&amp;typ=SET&amp;NRROWS=500&amp;RESULTSET=1&amp;DOC_TITLE=2018) of 2018 and it shows that your government voted for nearly all EU regulations and that small countries are rarely overruled.

All EU legislation has to go through the Council of the European Union where the national governments are represented. In 2018, the Council voted on 97 legislative acts (directives and regulations). 79 of those were unopposed = not a single government voted against it. 9 acts were opposed by 1 country, 8 acts by 2 countries, and 2 acts by 5 countries.

This shows: Even though the Council needs only 55 % of member states to adopt new legislation they always try to get to a consensus and the average approval is actually 98.7 %. The two acts with the most opposition had still 82 % support.

Czechia opposed the most acts: 4 out of 97. The countries that opposed 3 acts are Finland, Hungary, Poland, and the UK. Opposed to 2 acts were Cyprus, Denmark, Italy, Lithuania, Malta, and Slovakia. 1 act was opposed by Austria, Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Sweden.

China also has its hard-core nationalistic fraction but is generally suppressed by CCP, CCP did release those sentiments from time to time however, as response to foreign incidents, like the 2012 one.

It is worth noting that the far rights of Japan is often supported by USA since WWII. It began as a way for USA to counteract communism in Japan.

I bet that's why they do [things like this](https://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Politics-And-Diplomacy/Multi-billion-budget-deal-for-Arab-sector-aims-to-improve-standard-of-living-451466) and why Israeli Arabs are one of the most educated populations in the middle-east, or [why there are programs in place to increase their enrollment in Israeli universities](https://www.timesofisrael.com/number-of-arab-students-in-israeli-universities-grows-78-in-7-years/).

Every last Israeli Jew is just racist to the core. That's right, they're *exactly* like your Nazi/fascist grandfather. You know that feel when you just hate Arabs, so damn much, and want them to suffer in every possible way. That's the sole explanation of why the situation in the West Bank is the way it is. One might be deluded into reflecting whether or not it is reasonably upon incumbent upon Israel, as the civilian administrator in Area C, to accept and provide infrastructure as well as maintenance for EU prefabs wherever and whenever they prop up without consultation, but obviously anyone other than a shill would realize that *but of course* it is. 

One might ponder whether it would be more constructive to set those classrooms up in any number of areas, such as A and B, where permissions are more readily available, and if none really are anywhere, than to publicize the failed attempt to secure such permissions in order to illustrate the problem.

We have seen recently that there is a open clash now between Macron and the german political class (Merkel and others). It is serious. You may also missed the letter of the French ambassador in Germany putting pressure on Germany to stop banning sales on SA while Germany was doing it sneakily. There were also talks about breaking joint venture between France and Germany due to the overall sentiment that Germany will use that leverage (being the superior economy) to just pick France industry apart. This is realpolitik i'm talking about.

And that's my whole point here. With a proper national made product, it's way harder to put pressure on you. By having joint venture, or an other country selling you weapons, you expose yourself.

I fear theres too many biases, I suspect it would be dominated by the usual suspects and undermine one of Europe's great strengths all on the assumption that a unified political party would be able to cater to so many local realities.

Would you expect northern Europeans vote for an Italian? No way would Mogherini or Draghi be in office if they had to relay on the average German, Dutch or Frenchman. Just read the comment section of anything related to Italy, the same tired old stereotypes. There's still too many prejudices, stereotypes, and ignorance (ontop of cultural and linguistic barriers) for people to run cross border campaigns.

Additionally if you were running in multiple countries it would make sense to focus on those areas where the largest votes can be gained, Germany, France and Italy ignoring smaller countries, why fight for Maltese votes when even a ""loss"" in Germany would still net you more MEPs. For me one of Europe's points of pride is that smaller nations are disproportionately influential, I fear Pan-European parties would negate that as running a campaign in all 27 member states would require prioritizing, and although Maltese votes are more powerful, they are also few few MEPs up for grabes, better to focus on France where a strong campaign will win you many seats.

Furthermore although it could make sense to have a single Europhile ""Maximum Integration and Union"" party for weirdos like me many other political ideas wouldn't exist or make much sense. Conservatism in Sweden is different from that found in Bulgaria or France, Nordic socialism might prioritize things in Copenhagen that aren't a problem in Thessaloniki, Greens in one country my be Pro Nuclear while green votes in another country might be disgusted by the idea.

Like what? Person A registers to vote. Person B impersonates person A and votes by stating adress and name. Person A doesn't feel like leaving the house that day. Never goes voting. Person B votes under his real identity later. What is that safe guard you talked about? If A and B are not voting at the same station, this will always go under the radar.

&gt; - Some people don't need ID in their life

That's just wrong. You need some sort of identification for nearly everything. Be it a job, a payment plan or opening a bank account. Or driving a car. Or renting a flat. The US mainly uses their SSN (which is a horrible concept). The UK uses adress and name or whatever the fuck. Other more developed countries use government issued ID cards. The underlying factor is that the other party wants to know who they are dealing with if you enter a contract of any sorts with them. Because without that, they will have no way to enforce their contract given rights.

Hurdles like price of the ID card can (and are) be helped by not charging for those on welfare. Being homeless can also be dealt with via welfare.

&gt; Just, be brave and commit to your actual stance, ""I don't particularly like poor or minority voters (the groups that's were most 'discouraged' in the trial of voter ID) and I'd prefer they don't get the ability to vote"", because that's literally the only stance from the reality of the situation.

2504,"I'd argue that is somewhat wrong. France itself had a lot of ethnic minorities and german ethnics, until the revolution instituted forced assimilation. And the only thing that ended western nationalist retribution was WW2, and the massive population movements that followed. Although Northern Ireland and Spanish minorities continued regional resistance.

&amp;#x200B;

In my opinion, all European nationalism has a tragic birth because of the philosophies of forced standardization and tribal heredity. Switzerland and India also had nationalistic movements across multi-lingual and multi-religious populations but didn't engage in the same levels of genocide because they centered more on shared principles, than heredity or standardization of culture.

&amp;#x200B;

The central and eastern experience was the worse not because of their borders, ethnic mish-mashes are the norm everywhere outside of genocidal Europe, but because more so than even the French, they needed to standardize the ethnic-identity to an insane degree: appearance, language, religion, history, culture..  Most importantly, central and eastern europe saw national affiliation as tribal. Countries capable of civic nationalism you could assimilate those foreign into their nation, in central and eastern europe ethno-nationalism you are always a foreigner, and therefore the Other, who can only be tolerated or killed.   


That being said, I agree that the false histories helped institute this regime of tribal genocide, because they are the ones that created the tribes in the first place. They were passed on according to linguistic routes, due to issues of comprehension, and eventually each mildly linguisticly inteligable group of people were convinced that they were all directly related, and it went all downhill from there. Of course, genetic testing has shown there are almost no clear lineages, especially in the balkans, linguistic differences are almost minor like the Serbo-Croat division if they mattered at all, and the religious devisions were insane in the first place.

2624,"The problem is all Central- and Eastern European nations tried to force the lies of nationalism onto their nations. While in the West borders more or less followed linguistic ones, or minorities were khm taken care before romantic awakening (looking at you France), in the East the process started after nationalism took root and inevitably led to tragedies practically all countries in the region have bloody hands in, and the official versions of each countries history taught to every generation became an idealized bullshit. Medieval rulers became venerated heroes, battles became scenes where nations rose or fell, peasent revolters were turnt into freedom-fighters.    

And so this led to endless tu coc-ing and whataboutisms, naturally everyones own version of a regions histpry wildly clashed with others, and the Internet only amplified this. A rich, complex, multiethnic history was flushed down the drain (or rather never gave the chance to emerge) and stories  with complexity of  black and white folk tales became the norm. And today, as after many tragedies most states are more or less homogenous this false history theres really not much popular incentive to revise these, and progressive historians are called out as leftist nation-haters or worse.

The situation this resulted in was that there was, for example, a case of rape being reported in some multi ethnic city, and Serb news reported the perpetrators were Kosovar Albanians, Croat news reported they were Serbs, and so on.

All this is not to take blame away from such figures as Milosevic and Karadzic, but it’s important to remember it wasn’t exactly limited to them. Tudjman, for example, also wasn’t exactly a nice guy.

you are simply incorrect.

My point is that your initial comment is highly misleading/incorrect - as it implies that women in all of Switzerland were not allowed to vote some 26 years ago.

2979,"Normally the term ""tactical victory, strategic loss"" is used to highlight the fact that a specific battle or operation was fought in such a way that in isolation, it would have worked well, but failed to achieve its greater goals.  It's not something that the British just made up for Jutland.

Here, let me go dig up some for someone else.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Tirad_Pass

&gt;* Strategic Filipino victory
&gt;* Tactical American victory

-

&gt; Despite nearly total annihilation, however, the Filipinos under Del Pilar held off the Americans long enough for Aguinaldo to escape.

They were outfought, but achieved the goals with which they fought the battle.

Or:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Coral_Sea

&gt;Both sides publicly claimed victory after the battle. In terms of ships lost, the Japanese won a tactical victory by sinking a U.S. fleet carrier, an oiler, and a destroyer – 41,826 long tons (42,497 t) – versus a light carrier, a destroyer, and several smaller warships – 19,000 long tons (19,000 t) – sunk by the U.S. side. Lexington represented, at that time, 25% of U.S. carrier strength in the Pacific.[92] The Japanese public was informed of the victory with overstatement of the U.S. damage and understatement of their own.[93]
&gt;
&gt;From a strategic perspective, however, the battle was an Allied victory as it averted the seaborne invasion of Port Moresby, lessening the threat to the supply lines between the U.S. and Australia. Although the withdrawal of Yorktown from the Coral Sea conceded the field, the Japanese were forced to abandon the operation that had initiated the Battle of Coral Sea in the first place.[94]

Japan wasn't aiming to engage in a naval fight — she wanted to have a single, scripted, all-in naval battle that would occur later — but to invade Port Moresby, and didn't achieve her larger goals.

The fact that both Germany and the UK publicly-claimed victory in Jutland just means that both sides, with an eye to ongoing public opinion about the war, chose to highlight the bit that was most favorable to them.

Germany sank more tons, but her aim was not a skirmish with her bait — the operation did not succeed in what it set out to do.

Now, true, the British didn't succeed in exploiting the German move the way they wanted either, but typically the side that initiates is the one with the onus to achieve its objectives.

I'll concede that there's a certain amount of interpretation that can happen.  If I were High Judge of Military Victories, I'd call the War of 1812 an American loss, British victory rather than a stalemate (the US initiated the war and aimed to defeat Canada, and did not do so, though they countered the subsequent opportunistic British attempt at reconquering the American colonies), and I'd call the Korean War a UN victory, North Korean/Soviet/Chinese loss rather than a stalemate, because North Korea initiated the war and aimed to conquer South Korea, though they countered the subsequent opportunistic attempt to take North Korea.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/buhbdx/naval_strength_of_european_countries_in_1914/epnb6ms/,vokegaf,1559324585

2985,"Thanks for the link mate. I know I can also try searching for sources myself but usually the person making claims should be able to provide adequate references.



Regarding your link I'd suggest trying to look at these ""protests"" from the Israeli/IDFs perspective. These ""protests"" are not ""peaceful"". 
If you show up right at a the fence of a border installation and basically riot with hundreds, if not thousands of people, including trying to destroy and break through said border installation, lighting tires on fire trying to prevent the border guards from seeing what you're doing at the fence, etc. etc. *then you bloody well can't act all surprised that they'll react in some way to make you stop.* Even more so when keeping in mind that there have been previous violent attacks on IDF soldiers so there's a reasonable expectation that these rioters *will* try to attack the IDF soldiers if they get the chance.

To quote your link:

&gt;The Commission found that some members of the Higher National Committee organising the protests, which includes Hamas representatives, encouraged or defended demonstrators’ use of indiscriminate incendiary kites and balloons, causing fear among civilians and significant damage to property in southern Israel. The Commission concluded that Hamas, as the de facto authority in Gaza, failed to prevent these acts.

Like no fucking shit Sherlock, guess what happens if you send fucking incendiary bombs on kites over the border trying to injure people. 

By the way, that IDF reaction usually starts out with tear gas canisters and rubber bullets, i.e. non-lethal options because, who would have guessed, regular border guards usually prefer *not* having to kill people if they can avoid it.

These rioters are one of the leading contenders of the ""*play stupid games, win stupid prices*""-contest. Want to know how to not risk getting teargassed or rubberbulleted or even shot at with lethal ammunition? Don't fucking riot at that fucking border. It's not rocket science, and that method works whatever your personal stance on Israel and that border is. Likewise if you're an actually peaceful protester and various other people in your vicinity brought homemade firebombs on kites then maybe, *just maybe* don't associate with these people in any way and keep a distance.


Nevertheless at least a few instances in that report seem suspicious, e.g. I don't see a reason why trained soldiers should have shot at clearly marked paramedics. Such cases should generally be investigated because ideally that shouldn't happen at all and it needs to be analysed whether they were shot at deliberately or unintentionally.


Btw. I'm honestly surprised that there aren't way more surveillance camera recordings available both from the IDF as well as from the palestinian side. Unedited, raw footage of such occurrences from at least a few different angles would allow for more objective analysis. I'm inclined to assume that everybody not willing to provide such recordings has some kind of dishonest, questionable motivation, like US cops ""accidentally"" turning of their body cams or mysteriously loosing the recording in some way.",,/r/europe/comments/bv4ens/israel_to_auction_prefab_classrooms_donated_by_eu/epnbbr3/,Nononogrammstoday,1559324653

Try to put yourself into the others' shoes and understand their perspective. When people grow up in a conflict like this, they aren't even aware of what this life they *could* live would look like, and as such what they're missing out on. The only thing they have is their pride, hence the radicalization and the anger spawning new terrorists alongside people who just want to be left alone. And this pride will be considered a far more valuable good than any ""independence"" that exists only on paper.

2997,"&gt; What part of the Geneva Convention are you referring to, specifically? As far as I'm aware, it doesn't deal with territorial disputes at all, but rather the treatment of combatants and civilians.

It certainly does refer to territorial disputes, which is why the UN position of claiming all Israeli settlements illegal is so absurd. The Geneva Convention specifically states that you cannot annex land from another state during war but The West Bank was not annexed by another state as there was no state laying claim of it (Israel can claim Jordan created the situation by releasing it and withdrawing the citizenship of the Palestinians, which they de facto did).

Further more, it gives a nation the right to occupy strategically important areas (such as Area C) if it is of particular strategic or tactical importance.

You cannot read the Geneva Convention and cherry pick stuff like the Anti-Israel faction always does, you have to read it in its entirety and the context of what each paragraph is written.

Well everyone has morals that's a silly thing to assume.

Anyways point is if a large part of the reason you are vegan is your morals then you have to acknowledge you will have an extremely large bias to veganism as an environmental solution.

3067,"Again, that's the ""official"" meaning of the word, not how it's actually used in the common lexicon.

I can't find the article(s) but basically the point was being made that regardless of income and length of stay, an African Engineer would still be called an immigrant. Whereas an English plumber retiring  in Torre Molinos would be an expat even if he didn't have any intention of going back to England.

Regardless of whether the positive or negative connotation is picked intentionally, that's the choice of words that is commonly made. I don't remember ever coming across ""English immigrant"" in any context. Or ""American immigrant"" for what matters.

Edit: [ah, found one](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/mar/13/white-people-expats-immigrants-migration)

""Don’t take my word for it. The Wall Street Journal, the leading financial information magazine in the world, has a blog dedicated to the life of expats and recently they featured a story ‘Who is an expat, anyway?’. Here are the main conclusions: “Some arrivals are described as expats; others as immigrants; and some simply as migrants. It depends on social class, country of origin and economic status. It’s strange to hear some people in Hong Kong described as expats, but not others. Anyone with roots in a western country is considered an expat … Filipino domestic helpers are just guests, even if they’ve been here for decades. Mandarin-speaking mainland Chinese are rarely regarded as expats … It’s a double standard woven into official policy.”
Is there any space in the development debate for African experts?

The reality is the same in Africa and Europe. Top African professionals going to work in Europe are not considered expats. They are immigrants. Period. “I work for multinational organisations both in the private and public sectors. And being black or coloured doesn’t gain me the term “expat”.

Israel was the weaker party, nearly being annihilated twice.  Facing decades of terrorism and insurgency.

3155,"And as much as I hate Milosevic, and I hate him extremely, our government was offered a worse ultimatum than the infamous one from 1914, the one all the free nations deemed unacceptable more than a hundred years ago. Just read the Rambouillet accords and you'll get what I'm saying. It was simply asking for complete capitulation. It preety much said that we should let Kosovo break away in a few years and let NATO troops roam the country at their will being exempt from local laws. This ultimatum was made to be declined. Sorry but we got of better with the war.

Probably not all these hits were intentional, but some were without a doubt. Google 'Grdelica train boombing'. They hit a passanger train full of civilians twice. Then NATO said it was a mistake that they were targeting a nearby bridge. Latter it was reveled that it was a precision guided missile strike so it was targeted. But then they said the trains was going too fast so it got in the way. They put out the footage to prove their statement only to be revealed that the footage was x4.7 faster that the original and that the train was going about 10km/h. To make it worse after hiting it once they turned around and hit the already destroyed train again. So that was a totaly intentional boombing of civilian train that killed dozens witch makes it a war crime without a doubt. No one answered for that crime.

I'm not saying that NATO intentions of stoping Milosevic in Kosovo were bad, I'm saying that except those intentions everything else was bad.

There were no good guys in that fight. Nothing was solved and all that's left are the ruins of cities and families that were subjected to orders made by uneducated and scared individuals that were able to stir up the easily influenced to hate their neighbours and friends.

3194,"&gt; The ARD (official German news) censoring any criticism to the 2014 attack on Palestine was the biggest free-speech censorship agenda I've ever seen in Germany.

Is that so. [That's not how I remember it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5lmrEtT2w).

Personally, I've always sided with the UN on the subject. The biggest problem in the public always seems to be that a lot of people firmly pick one side over the other (many Germans unconditionally favoring Palestine, many Americans Israel) and stick with it, rather than acknowledging it as a complex issue where both sides share in the guilt of continuing escalations, separate from Israel having been the original instigator of the conflict decades ago.

A big problem in 2014 was that a lot of Pro-Palestine demonstrations in Germany [actually did devolve in plain antisemitism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h1yp4r6DvM), and I think the term ""nazi"" is somewhat justified in these circumstances.

3220,"My argument for why 16-year-olds should be allowed to vote is along these lines: 

The only 16-year-olds that would actually vote are the most mature, politically active 16-year-olds. It would be a self-selecting group. When we speak of 16-year-olds voting, we must not think of the average 16-year-old, but the most mature half or third of them.

I only became properly interested in politics when I had gained the right to vote and had to choose a candidate to vote for in the next elections, and I started to do research to try to make an educated choice.

That said, I don't think it is not wrong that the limit is 18 years and not 16, so it is not something I would fight very hard for.

Now some years in the future my license is going to expire and I'll have to exchange it for a new one.

As for voting it's a different situation and I don't think there should be any tests to prove one isn't senile. That could be easily abused and people could be denied their vote. But as we have an age limit on the lower end I'm absolutely for exploring if it makes sense doing the same on the upper end too. They should do studies on the abilities of the average 16 year old to understand complex political issues vs that of a 80 year old, for example. Yes, some mentally fit people will be excluded together with the senile ones but that's already a reality now with younger people too.

AV is probably the best compromise for Britain, maintaining single-seat constituencies, but making the system slightly less prone to the spoiler effect (i.e. ensuring that a right-winger cannot win a 66% left-leaning constituency because the lefties are split among two parties) and opening a room for a third or fourth major party to succeed.

*1) The voter votes on a single list by picking a candidate with an 'x' mark in the box, by choosing a single candidate they show their preference as to who gets the mandate from this list.* 

*2) A vote for two or more candidates from separate lists or for noone is invalid.* 

*3) A vote solely for a candidate from a struck out list is invalid.* 

*4) A vote solely for a struck out candidate is a valid vote for a list.* 

*5) A vote for two or more candidates from the same list is a valid vote for the topmost candidate.* 

Now*,* I cut that out, but all of the above norms refer to an ""'x' mark"". It is defined in art. 5 pnt 12) as ""at least two lines intersecting within the box"".

Now, since the vote in OP has two lines which intersect in a single box, and since that happens only once, the vote is technically legal - and as we know, sticking to the letter with no thought given is the best way to apply laws. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

He used the image of Che to form a cult of personality around himself.

3609,"This does not make the concept of races any scientific, it's just a broad categorisation.

Draw a curve on the worldmap from Paris to Beijing, selecting all individuals you go through. You will not just have people in between ""white"", ""arab"" and ""asian"" that don't fall into categories (which is already an issue for scienticity), you will have a full continuity of people with different phenotypes, this poses two problems.

* Any neighbourhood of a point selected on the line can be considered a race of it's own right. They are not clear cut examples like an individual coming from a central african mother and a north american father, they are sedentary, localised peoples with phenotypes that vary around the central point that you select abitrarily. That point is no more legitimate than the ones you take for classic ""races"".
* Furthermore it's impossible to objectively draw an actual physical or genetical line where one race stops and another one starts, they are necessarily arbitrary

Then there is the concept of ""mixed races"", which as you say ""complicates it"". I postulate that it does not complicate the phenomenon of individual variations, it just demonstrates it, adding more and more special cases to subjects that defy the previous categorisation. This is not scientific, imagine if newton studying movement, instead of providing a theoretical framework to describe the movement of objects merely decided to write down every time he saw an object move, and adding in different objects he saw moving whenever he had not seen one make the same trajectory, thinking that he could make a dictionary of all movement, saying that if someone would ever like to predict the movement of an object, they could just refer to the dictionnaire. The information that he would have compiled would not be a scientific theory, it would be stupid.

For these reasons the concept of race is not a scientific one. This is not to say that physical differences don't exist, it's just that they are not described truthfully by the concept of race.

Here's an exerpt from the wikipedia article

&gt;Sexual harassment is an offensive or humiliating behaviour that is related to a person's sex. It can be a subtle or overt sexual nature of a person (sexual annoyance, e.g. flirting, expression of sexuality, etc.) that results in wrong communication or miscommunication, implied sexual conditions of a job (sexual coercion), etc. It can happen anywhere, but is most common in the workplace, schools, and the military. It involves unwanted and unwelcome words, deeds, actions, gestures, symbols, or behaviours of a sexual nature that make the target feel uncomfortable.",,/r/europe/comments/buuub7/frances_metoo_creator_on_trial_for_defaming_man/epkl1f4/,Thisismethisisalsome,1559276195

Depends on the wording of the deal. In Guantanamo’s case they don’t.

&gt; I'm sorry what? Stalin? Joseph Stalin? As in that Georgian guy from the Soviet Union? wtf does he have to do with anything? Are you comparing Castro to Stalin? That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard, Castro hated Stalin so much he actually passed laws preventing a cult of personality around himself just because of Stalin, it's the reason it's illegal in Cuba to build statues of Castro or name streets after him etc

A tad naive. Castro did make a cult around himself, he just used the image of Che to do it. 

Dog whistles are not a recent invention.

Just look at the state publications, they use the image of Che to promote the same blind nationalism and leader worship any other dictator would want.

It’s clear, when you see Che they want you to think Castro.

&gt; it actually didn't it was very exploitative and wealth inequality was almost unbelievable. There's a reason why Castro's socialism was so popular in Cuba in the 60s

Referendums are also extremely rare occurrences, so we'll never have the equivalent of a state-level referendum on constitutional matters cropping up on the ballot paper during a normal election.

I never argued the trials weren't immensely important, just as I never argued the nation building aspect of the US occupation wasn't important.  I stated that the US won the war in Iraq, but I recognize they lost the nation building part.  You tried to argue that a war was all encompassing, therefore it included things after the major military conflict.  If you look at WW2, people *don't* include the Nuremberg trials as part of the war, they consider the war won before that, so it makes your original point mute.  

Look at it this way, if the US had just said they wanted to depose Sadaam and they could care less what happens afterwards, you would unambiguously say they won that war.  But people conflate their effort to build an Iraqi national with a war, which is just a weird way of looking at it.  I'm not arguing the conflict was a good thing, it certainly wasnt, I am arguing the US does not lose wars.  I argue this because they don't, they crush any enemies and are only held back by their self restraint.  If a country truly threatened the existence of the US, you can be sure that country would be annihilated.  The US is the uncontested hegemon, as much as that sucks for some people to accept.

According to this article, the legal ""safe"" limit for boar is 600 Bq/kg of Cs137. Cs137 is a beta emitter with energy ~500keV. For reference, Potassium 40 is also a beta emitter of energy 1300 keV; more energetic. How much do we have in our body? About 4000 Bq worth. The biological half life of Cs137 is 70 days, meaning in order to *double* your natural background dose, just from internal radionuclides, you would need to eat about 4kg a month continuously for years. And that would only double it. Now, maybe this might be bad for people whose diet solely consists of wild boar, but for the average joe its not even noticable.

Eh, no. My post is an answer to a non-factual claim on Christians being better in many issues since ""their religion is upgraded"" somehow, while it's not the case, but that's a pretty much something tied to being more irreligious and taking things less seriously/literally, while Perry much everthing is region specific.

Then you had your weird argument about comparing apples and orange while you do compare European Christians with MENA or African Muslims - while that's comparing apples and oranges since you would be comparing European Muslims and European Christians in some regions, and do the same for MENA and rest of the Africa.

I haven't even claimed if next generations would be with less or more hatred. Again, you're having some delusion there. I also don't know if there is any research on having less or more hatred for the next generations, and doubt if you do know any.

4001,"**German politician: We care about our own interests**

I am sorry on behalf of my Polish colleagues that Germany is so dominant in the European Union when it comes to its own interests,' says German politician Ulrike Trebesius in a conversation with Deutsche Welle and Interia.

- We must be realistic in the EU. Germany is giving up nuclear and coal power, and we need to find new solutions. It is important for us to have a long-term supply in the energy market. That is why an investment such as Nord Stream 2 is important for us,"" German conservative MEP Ulrike Trebesius (LKR) said in an interview with Interia and Deutsche Welle.

- This is a real policy. But of course I am sorry on behalf of my Polish colleagues that Germany is so dominant in the EU when it comes to its own interests,"" she added. Trebesius, as well as former Prime Minister and MEP of the Civic Platform Jerzy Buzek, were guests of the ""Study Europe"" programme, carried out jointly by Deutsche Welle and Interia in Brussels.

**It was never about banning**

Nord Stream 2 was back on the EU agenda last week when the EP voted to amend the gas directive to bring pipelines from outside the EU (including those built with Russia's participation NS2) under EU law. However, critics accuse the regulations of being too lenient for Gazprom, which is one of the investors, and that they will only make the construction of the disputed gas pipeline more difficult, but will not stop it.

- This directive never intended to ban the construction of a pipeline,"" defended Jerzy Buzek. The Polish politician piloted the draft regulations in the European Parliament. - If anyone wants to build a pipeline, go ahead. We only need to apply EU law. In the directive we say that all supply pipelines should comply with European law. This is certainly not convenient for Gazprom, which would like to be a monopolist.

The politician explained that all negotiations concerning such investments as gas pipelines from countries outside the EU will be subject to strict control by the European Commission. - For example, Germany can start these negotiations, but cannot sign any agreement or any agreement with Gazprom without the consent of the European Commission,"" said the MEP.

He also added that these were ""the strictest rules"" and that EU politicians had done ""everything they could"" on this issue.

**Better or worse in the EU?**

MEPs also assessed the health of the EU at the end of the current term of the European Parliament and the European Commission. Trebesius pointed to the negative aspects of the last five years, while Buzek focused on the positive aspects.

- One of the main promises at the beginning of the term of office was to ensure greater prosperity for Europeans and it is clear that it was not kept - said the German politician. - The problems we have had in the last five years, such as the migration crisis, have led to major conflicts within the EU and between Poland and Germany. In addition, we have brexite, and we are still struggling with the problems of some of the euro area Member States. These are problems which we have not managed to solve,"" she said.

The OP politician, on the other hand, argued that during this term of office ""we have learned a great deal in terms of joint treatment and solving problems"".

- The assessment of the last five years depends on what the external challenges are. Now they are bigger than they were 5 or 10 years ago. For example, the refugee crisis and the war in Syria - said Jerzy Buzek.",,/r/europe/comments/buxf2f/german_politician_we_care_about_our_own_interests/epiyllr/,GorgeousPriceless,1559244658

It's not wrong to point out that left unchecked, companies will cut corners on safety. However, it's also true that companies can develop a culture of safety where people actually care.

It also wasn't the Greens which kept subsidising coal, but SPD and CDU (the former because nostalgia apparently, the latter because RWE). They also didn't kill the German solar industry.

Then: Not building new plants has been cross-party political consensus for ages, the question has always been ""how long do we keep the old ones running"". Not building nukes is not a green thing, it's a German thing, short of, well, RWE and lackeys.

The only thing wrong about the Green's stance on energy production is their lack of support for fusion research, which costs peanuts. (Ignore ITER, that's much more of a diplomatic than scientific endeavor. Think Wendelstein).

Their programme says that they want to shut down the 20 oldest (most polluting) coal plants immediately, and be done with shutting down all by 2030. Shutting down those 20 can be done without any impact on the electricity net, what'd happen is reduced export and, initially, already existing gas plants taking up slack.

4182,"""Turkey has released Serkan Golge, a NASA scientist who the country accused of belonging to a terrorist organization. 

 ...

Golge said prison officials dropped him off outside of the facility in Hatay late Wednesday night -- without a cellphone or anything else -- and told him he was a free man. He walked barefoot for about 1.2 miles and found a village, where he called his family and asked them to pick him up

&amp;#x200B;

 Golge said he can't immediately return to the U.S. because he doesn’t have his passport and isn't allowed to leave the country. 

...

He said officials told him that he wasn’t pardoned -- his case is still ongoing -- but the Supreme Court simply decided that he didn’t have to stay in prison any longer.

...

""I do not know what to do now. I lost my job at NASA,"" he said. ""I lost all my savings because of what has happened to me.""

 

Golge’s lawyer confirmed his release to ABC News on Wednesday and State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said she welcomed the news in an on-camera briefing.

""We will continue to follow Mr. Golge's case closely, along with those involving our own locally employed staff at Mission Turkey,"" she said.

...

News of Golge’s release comes after the White House and the Turkish president’s office revealed that the leaders of the two countries spoke on the phone earlier on Wednesday.

...

Deere’s readout didn’t mention Golge or anyone else held by Turkey.

Golge’s lawyer said the decision came from Turkey’s Supreme Court and wasn’t sure what specifically prompted it.""",,/r/europe/comments/buw4e7/nasa_scientist_released_from_turkish_prison_after/epif31u/,0n0mat0poeia,1559238307

4235,"&gt; Salvini, Farage and Le pen have no particular hatred for foreigners either just that they don't agree with mass immigration.

They also lead organizations which use hatred of foreigners to garner support. 

You are talking to someone which had UKIP and the SNP stands sit side by side as a foreigner, so this isn't an academic discussion where you can just point to the window dressing and hope no one knows what's behind.

 The SNP network with local asians organizations, proposed and implemented visa extensions for masters students to find work, and actually address their asian and european members as a community. They don't have ""a"" black person or ""a"" danish MEP, they have an institutionalized response to their membership. Basically, the SNP is in recruiting mode constantly, which is the heart of civic nationalism. 

UKIP, and now the Brexit Party, by comparison does not recruit, they just assume you're already bought in and just need to realize it, if they can't ride some innate ethno-nationalistic leaning in the individual they flounder.  

Sorry to say, but much like ""classic liberal"" before this, ""civic nationalism"" makes a poor flag of convenience because groups who are actually civic nationalists are a world apart in methods and have no alienated organizations and people which would have given their claim of ""not being bigots"" legitimacy.


&gt;As if those organisations aren't run by anti-white leftists.

And yet the SNP has good relationships with them. And, btw, one of the things there groups definetly aren't is ""leftist"". Minority organizations tend to be both socially and economically conservative. Hence the reason why the SNP is the one with stronger  ties, and not the Greens.

4347,"People have simply become uncivilised in a civilised country, succumbing to stupid rthetoric. As acclaimed Russian author and physician [Anton Chekhov](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anton_Chekhov) wrote this following fascinating and honest letter of advice to his troubled older brother, [Nikolai](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Chekhov), a talented painter and writer who, despite being just 28 himself, had for many years been plagued by alcoholism to the point where he often slept on the streets, his days a blur; his notable skills as an artist largely untapped. This letter and the list it contained—eight qualities exhibited by ""civilized"" people—were essentially Anton's attempt at knocking some sense into the brother he was slowly losing. 

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;nbsp;

&amp;#x200B;

 To my mind, civilized people ought to satisfy the following conditions:  


1. They respect the individual and are therefore always indulgent, gentle, polite and compliant. They do not throw a tantrum over a hammer or a lost eraser. When they move in with somebody, they do not act as if they were doing him a favor, and when they move out, they do not say, ""How can anyone live with you!"" They excuse noise and cold and overdone meat and witticisms and the presence of others in their homes.   


2. Their compassion extends beyond beggars and cats. They are hurt even by things the naked eye can't see. If for instance, Pyotr knows that his father and mother are turning gray and losing sleep over seeing their Pyotr so rarely (and seeing him drunk when he does turn up), then he rushes home to them and sends his vodka to the devil. They do not sleep nights the better to help the Polevayevs, help pay their brothers' tuition, and keep their mother decently dressed.   


3. They respect the property of others and therefore pay their debts.   


4. They are candid and fear lies like the plague. They do not lie even about the most trivial matters. A lie insults the listener and debases him in the liar's eyes. They don't put on airs, they behave in the street as they do at home, and they do not try to dazzle their inferiors. They know how to keep their mouths shut and they do not force uninvited confidences on people. Out of respect for the ears of others they are more often silent than not.   


5. They do not belittle themselves merely to arouse sympathy. They do not play on people's heartstrings to get them to sigh and fuss over them. They do not say, ""No one understands me!"" or ""I've squandered my talent on trifles!"" because this smacks of a cheap effect and is vulgar, false and out-of-date.   


6. They are not preoccupied with vain things. They are not taken in by such false jewels as friendships with celebrities, handshakes with drunken Plevako, ecstasy over the first person they happen to meet at the Salon de Varietes, popularity among the tavern crowd. They laugh when they hear, ""I represent the press,"" a phrase befitting only Rodzeviches and Levenbergs. When they have done a penny's worth of work, they don't try to make a hundred rubles out of it, and they don't boast over being admitted to places closed to others. True talents always seek obscurity. They try to merge with the crowd and shun all ostentation. Krylov himself said that an empty barrel has more chance of being heard than a full one.   


7. If they have talent, they respect it. They sacrifice comfort, women, wine and vanity to it. They are proud of their talent, and so they do not go out carousing with trade-school employees or Skvortsov's guests, realizing that their calling lies in exerting an uplifting influence on them, not in living with them. What is more, they are fastidious.   


8. They cultivate their aesthetic sensibilities. They cannot stand to fall asleep fully dressed, see a slit in the wall teeming with bedbugs, breathe rotten air, walk on a spittle-laden floor or eat off a kerosene stove. They try their best to tame and ennoble their sexual instinct... What they look for in a woman is not a bed partner or horse sweat, \[...\] not the kind of intelligence that expresses itself in the ability to stage a fake pregnancy and tirelessly reel off lies. They—and especially the artists among them—require spontaneity, elegance, compassion, a woman who will be a mother... They don't guzzle vodka on any old occasion, nor do they go around sniffing cupboards, for they know they are not swine. They drink only when they are free, if the opportunity happens to present itself. For they require a *mens sana in corpore sano*.  \[Source\]( [http://www.lettersofnote.com/2013/07/every-hour-is-precious.html](http://www.lettersofnote.com/2013/07/every-hour-is-precious.html) )",,/r/europe/comments/busuod/children_whitening_skin_to_avoid_racial_hate/eph7vhf/,Onigrizia,1559223421

After the battle, they had 23 battleships and 4 battlecruisers ready for further action (with 3 battlecruisers having been sunk, and the remaining vessels damaged).  The Germans started with 16 battleships and 5 battlecruisers, and ended with 10 battleships (and no battlecruisers) still functional.

The Royal Navy had 10 of their 37 capital ships taken out of action, while the equivalent figure for the Germans was 11 of their 21 capital ships.

4473,"&gt; You have linked to a load of euro myths that literally no one cares about in the UK. We really don't.

I think you may be a bit too generous with your fellow countrymen -- the tabloids pushing these articles would not have as big a circulation if people truly would ""not care"" about them. Germany has a similar paper ([Bild](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bild)) with only slightly smaller circulation per head, and I remember how much it could play to and reinforce the prejudice of a large number of people from my first job before ""graduating"" from blue to white collar work.

They may not *convert* anyone who is already skeptical and aware of their controversial reputation, but just like fake news spread on social media, they speak to people who are leaning towards the argument they are supporting already, and essentially radicalize them further by pushing inflammatory half-truths meant to give people an opportunity to get emotional about.

It's print populism, plain and simple, and the idea that it doesn't have any effect in spite of being so popular seems, frankly put, naive. Look back to the Brexit referendum and the interviews of random people on the street, many of whom had no idea how the EU even works, or the people who said they regret their vote afterwards, *after* reading up on what they had just voted on.

It's just like with a certain red bus: *you* may not have fallen for it, but ultimately there's a reason people keep paying for this kind of advertisement.

Where I'm inclined to agree with you when it comes to the complexity is that this is not a uniquely British issue; as I mentioned above, I've seen many of my (former) countrymen in Germany being susceptible to tabloid narratives myself. It just so happened that this time, it ended up influencing a rather important vote.

4624,"&gt;against our wishes and for the rest of the members

This is always such a nonsensical simplification. 

1st: and foremost France and Germany aren't in agreement at all right now. Germany ignored just about all Macron's proposals (talk about a dickmove) and Merkel never seemed to care too much about pushing the EU forward.

2nd: If all the other members truly wanted something different they could easily vote Germany and France down. But they do not actually want something all that different.

The northern countries are generally ok with German stagnation as they are very skeptical of further integration. This includes Ireland, UK (before Brexit), Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden and Finland.

The southern countries generally allign with France's demands of further integration. This includes Spain, Portugal, Italy (though right now Italy is in political freefall), Greece and Cyprus.

Eastern Europe often cares very much about catching up with the west. As such they want as many EU funds as possible with as little responsibility as possible. Often the people do however see the EU as better and less corrupt than their national governments and they see it as a good way to stay out of Russia's sphere. Generally they allign with the more conservative skeptic bloq (I.e. the north) but not necessarily in every way. The Baltics resemble the Nordics a bit and the Balkans the south. EE includes for these purposes: Slovenia, Czechia, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Croatia, Bulgaria, Romania and the Baltics.

Belgium and Luxembourg are afaik squarely pro EU and rather idealistic about it. Austria tends to align with Germany/the Nordic bloq but may reach out to the East.

4637,"&gt; Do you have a tl;dr?

Every European country was a patchwork of local dialects. Before long distance travel and mass communications, almost every village had their own dialect. You travel like 200 km, and the dialects can be so different that its almost a different language. Then in the late 1800s, usually the ruling elites from big cities forced their version of language over the rest of the country.

The Parisian ruling class in France did this maybe a bit more forcefully than other countries, and wiped out the local languages a bit more effectively than the others.

Unfortunately for Poland this meant that it did not have any access to the sea, which is why the winning powers of WW1 tried to establish the ethnic german city Danzig was a sort of neutral ground. Danzig and the surrounding area were legally made part of Poland, but where under the control of the Leage of Nations, a sort of proto-UN. It was the reconquest of Danzig that was a key concern of german nationalists in the interwar period. 

Hitler, being an ethnic Bavarian with strong anti-prussian leanings, mostly cared about Poland as a target for expansion. I.e. as ""Lebensraum"" that was to be conquered and cleared of its current inhabitants.

If Scotland leaves the UK you would have no currency, would have a huge budget deficit, would have to take on your share of the British debt that we built up as a United Kingdom, would find your largest trading partner by a huge margin would now be a much more difficult to trade with and the standard of living for every Scot would decrease sharply and noticeably within a few years.

It would be a political uncoupling that makes the brexit shit show look like a walk in the park. It would cripple Scotland for generations and you could very well be a basket case for decades. Your financial industries would probably be hoovered up by London, your oil fields are drying up, I’m sure shortbread and whiskey will keep you afloat though.

Fair play to you guys if you vote to leave, despite all the polling (and the last referendum showing you don’t, the SNP crowd are just louder) but it would be an absolute shit show for you for many years. 

Meanwhile the rUK would actually benefit from it, once the sadness of the end of our Union was over. All the shipyards that the Royal Navy uses would be relocated to England creating jobs, the drain that Scotland has on English tax payers would be eliminated and British politics would be dominated by a Tory party who now can command a majority for the next 200 years. And the tories make the economy boom traditionally (while destroying the poor).

This is an article of just today
https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nordlb-recapitalisation-eu-idUSKCN1Q81WC

It is classic double standards. You hear Vestager attacking the italian bank bail out (300mln) but not the german one (3.7bln)

Here an old graph showing you who bailed out more banks, it is old because i challenge you to find an actual one since it goes against the narrative of ""bad italians"".
https://blogs.thomsonreuters.com/answerson/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2016/05/euro-bank-bailout.jpg

If i remember correctly the number German bail out are around 300bln while italian are at 10-20bln.

Plus when Merkel approved the QE she asked as condition that all the landsbanks where exempted from EBA controll and stress test.

Deutsche bank is the real sick of europe, it went near bankruptcy like 3-4 times in the last decade, every time it was saved, now it is selling DWS (its patrimonial management branch) and they are seeing if it is going to merge with Commerzbank, there is a high chance that Commerzbank will be bought by the italian second bank (Unicredit) while DWS is going to end in french hands.

It scares me how much propaganda and less informed people are, even more if you come from a PIIGS country and you know very well what it means to be on the other side.

Probably if Vestager wasnt so prone to hunt down italian illusions (of a mere 300mln) she would have caught her national bank laundering 200bln from dirty russian money.

A few points/questions I as a reader want to make because the article from the *South China Post* doesn’t explain:

1. Why is this being used as criteria?

2. Is this possibly because the US is already a highly developed nation with a saturated market and therefore less room for growth? Many German and other European countries have a strong placement within the US market and therefore can make it either unnecessary and/or difficult to penetrate into the market.

3. Is this because production costs (labor) are significantly cheaper in China compared to the US?

5190,"&gt;when europe has a credible alternative to the f-35, give me a call.

An alternative to what? Optimised stealth? Because that's literally the only selling point the F-35 has over the modernised Rafale F4, and it's a very feeble and questionable one, already suffering from many quirks, *and most importantly*, yet to be operationally proven as an *actual* meaningful force multiplier, justifying the design decisions to have it falling short compared to a 4th+ gen. jet like the Rafale on several critical baseline characteristics, from range, speed and maneuverability, to carrying capacity, modularity and cost effectiveness. 

As it stands so far, it's only a PR stunt for an overpriced aircraft -- in acquisition, maintenance, and costs per flight hour. Not to mention that it's still burdened with [unresolved critical issues](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/stealth-f-35-joint-strike-fighter-has-some-serious-problems-report-42892), which is alarming for an aircraft meant to serve as the keystone of a fleet.

And the decision, for a sovereign nation, to adopt a strategical aircraft [stocked with foreign spyware](https://www.news.com.au/technology/online/security/spy-f35s-send-sensitive-norwegian-military-data-back-to-lockheed-martin-in-the-united-states/news-story/12b4fafce6b579448cc8416518063d1f) is also quite questionable.

&amp;nbsp;

Both aircrafts have different designs anyway and as such are not strictly comparable, the Rafale is a multirole jet, whereas the F-35 can pretty much do only one thing efficiently (again, supposedly), and it's stealth ground attack. And some versions [may not even be able to do that](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/05/navys-f-35-doesnt-have-range-for-real-stealth-strikes-house-report-says/). Which says a lot about the shortcomings of its development process.

&amp;nbsp;

Either way, regardless of the actual capabilities of either aircrafts, you are naively deluded if you actually believe operational capability is the defining factor for those kinds of contracts. Those decisions are inherently bound to heavy lobbying and politics.",🇫🇷 Europe,/r/europe/comments/bueato/poland_plans_to_buy_32_f35a_fighters_minister/epdhf25/,Orravan_O,1559166282
5191,"In Portugal the elections are to elect the parliament, the president traditionally asks the leader of the biggest party in the parliament to form a new government, however, the current government is not even formed by the party that won the elections, it's actually a coalition of parties that have a majority in the parliament and allowed the biggest of the losers to govern. So you see, what we are lacking is an elected European president, but that would require people from all Nations to vote on the candidates, and most people wouldn't have the knowledge to vote on such a pan-national election, much as they don't for the European parliament for witch they always vote with national issues in mind. How can Europe have legitimacy when the elections are so distant from the people, i'm speaking mainly from my point of view as a Portuguese, people just don't understand what they are voting for, maybe in a couple of decades, since people have been learning about the EU and how it works only since the early 2000's... Older people have no clue how Europe works. I honestly think some kind of pan European documentary should be produced and shown on national televisions across Europe explaining it to the average Joe. For example, why would you vote for European elections based on your satisfaction for the current national government, it makes no sense, the European party you are voting on may have policies witch you are against and you don't even know what the fuck you are voting for, that's what populism means, stupid people voting for evil people because they feel righteous.",Portugal,/r/europe/comments/bu36fm/merkel_and_macron_split_over_weber_presidency/epdhgu1/,masterOfLetecia,1559166311

5265,"&gt;You should read this probably.

I'm very well aware of the infringement procedure, which is why I commented above about fines, but you might want to read through it too, as it is a pretty major hurdle, and given that we are talking about an Ireland that will actively be working to manage the CU it will likely be an incredibly difficult way to get to the point of fining Ireland, and again, even if that is the direction the EU goes (And I doubt it) there is no way that Ireland partitions the Island of Ireland.

&gt;This is forcing Ireland to do stuff. 

It's providing a penalty if Ireland doesn't do stuff, although the 'do stuff' in this case is 'achieve an outcome'. There is no EU Law that details a requirement for a specific type of external border, so it'd be a question of whether Ireland was managing goods entering Ireland from outside of the CU effectively nor not.

&gt;If that doesn't work, then you can't stop Poland from just ignoring whatever EU directives they want. Then you can't stop Italy from just starting to print fucking Euros. Because hey, the EU can't stop you right?

Ireland wouldn't be ignoring EU law though, your issue is with how that is done, and in that context, lots of EU members have faced issues and resolved them. If the EU has an issue with how Ireland is protecting the CU, the EU will let them know what they have an issue with and Ireland will tell the EU how it intends to remedy the issue and will remedy it. The EU can pursue the infringement process as long as it is unhappy (and member state agree..). 

Italy can't issue Euros because it has no authority to do so without consent of the ECB, so if it did without consent, they'd be counterfeit and that's on top of Italy then being in breach of union law. The sanction would come down to the infringement procedure on top of that, but Italy can't be kicked out of the Euro either.",United Kingdom - Personally vouched for by /u/colourfox,/r/europe/comments/bucyvt/scotland_publishes_second_independence_referendum/epcvcnj/,-ah,1559158883

5271,"&gt;Well you keep on responding to my comments in very arrogant way by asserting the same stupid talking point, that I have already acknowledged and addressed. I am not denying that the referendum happened and what the result was. The fact that public opinion isn’t fixed doesn’t and that the result was complex doesn’t conflict with that. I do believe that the EU could be more popular if done in the right way, just because current opinion is behind it doesn’t mean that it isn’t possible.





I'm the arrogant one? Mate your response to the fact that the British people don't want a political union is to say that you don't see an issue with them as if your opinion is objective reality 







&gt;I haven’t claimed that the British public stopped supporting the EU in 2016, just that they weren’t as engaged on this issue beforehand and therefore it made it easier for misinformation to spread. Especially when people are expected to vote on such a complex issue that was forced into a binary question like that.




You essentially did by claiming that they didn't care about the issue until 2016 if you don't care about something and then reject it after 1 vote then guess what? You stopped supporting it 









&gt;Just keep on asserting that and failing to deal with the points that I have raised. Most of the British public know jack shit about the EU, thanks to decades of misinformation and the fact that they felt entitled to vote on it in the first place is Dunning-Kruger in action. The leave campaign had to run on a nebulous understanding of what leave meant and hijacked a bunch of domestic issues in order to get 51.9% of voters to mark that box, to begin with. As no version of leave would have gotten a majority.








the Pro-Eu people know fuck all about the Eu as well which is why self described socialists in the labour party, support the Eu even tho the Eu is anything but Pro-Socialism. You seem to think that only people who know nothing about the EU want to leave it, that is not the case at all






&gt;Only 11% of the electorate voted for the Brexit party and parties with a clear pro-remain message got more. In fact that revoke Article 50 petition got more support. It was just the vote was concentrated in one party.








if you didn't vote you don't count end of, so the Brexit party got 30% the mostly pro leave tories got 15% got 3% so no the anti brexit people didn't win at most it was pretty much a draw. And that petition is irrelevant it was online and ran for days 

&gt;Doubt it, UKIP still got a lot of votes and Labour lost in due part because all of Scotland went to the SNP which had a high remain vote and even more so with the kind of people who would normally vote Labour. They also benefited from the collapse of the Lib Dems, after the coalition.








Had they not promised a referendum the Tories would've lost a fuckton of seats why is this hard for you to understand? Everyone acknowledges that's why Cameron called for the referendum why else would a remainer risk leaving the Eu like that?























&gt;The Lib Dems use to be the 3rd most popular party as well and they are one of the most pro-EU British political parties.











How is this relevant? in 2015 they were not the 3rd largest party votes wise it was UKIP


















&gt;I haven’t ignored them, I have responded to them and if you don’t like my answers that is your problem, not mine.











no you haven't I tell you a fact and you respond with your own personal opinion this is how this entire discussion has been I say ""The brits don't want a political union"" and you say ""but I do"" the entire time














&gt;UKIP would have never won outright, the electoral system would have not allowed it and people would have voted differently under another system so it would be hard to tell. The EU also wasn’t the big of an issue, even with UKIP supporters, it was immigration and even among UKIP voters the EU was only 35% vs 13% for the general population.








the electoral system was Ukip's best chance to win what do you mean? FPTP means they only needed 1 more vote than the 2nd largest party so they could win every seat theoretically with 20% of the vote if every other party gets less than 20% in every region. And the UKIP supporters who only cared about the EU voted for the Tories because the Tories made the promise







&gt;No I am not because you are misrepresenting my argument there. I merely stated that the EU wasn’t such a big issue until the public were expected to vote on it.




not true if not a vote does not happen









&gt;Maybe because the concept is rather daft to me and I have heard enough justification that I don’t find it particularly convincing. With many Brexit supporters portrayal of the EU being quite comical, making out to be some evil oppressive dictatorship when it is clearly not. I see the whole thing as rather a tragic mistake and it is a shame. It doesn’t mean that I worship the EU.

5285,"Woah. All of a sudden, you seem to be very passionate about this -- in your own previous words -- small and irrelevant issue.

Since you're taking this at a personal level, let me first clear my own personal position. Like at least one other person in this thread I think that, for Moldova, Transnistria is more trouble than it's worth and the best solution for them would probably be to renounce their claim to it.

With that out of the way, let's proceed further. 

First: Transnistria is not simply a self-governing region. Self-governing regions do not have their own armies. They do not put people in prison for supporting the central government. They do not receive and accept military support from third countries. They do not establish their own diplomatic relations with foreign countries.

Second: Simple Transnistrians are not willing participants in this charade. People do not choose of their own free will to live in a decrepit, 50-year-old vintage-technology amusement park. People do not choose of their free will to abandon their language. People do not elect their government with 103% of the vote. People do not keep electing for 30 years the same officials who use the public treasury as their own private piggy bank.

So why don't they leave? Because they're not all of them energetic 24-year-olds with a STEM diploma in their pocket. Because not all of them have excellent health. Because some have families: parents, grandparents, wives, husbands, children. Because it's their home. Because some of them are simply afraid -- of their own government, of the unknown, of leaving their meager belongings behind.

Does that make them hostages? In the classic sense, of having their hands tied behind their back and gun to their temple, no. In the wider sense, of being caught up in a situation not of their own doing, certainly yes.",Transylvania|Romania|Europe,/r/europe/comments/bu9f65/transnistria_russias_satellite_state_an_open/epcw3mn/,blueredneck,1559159127

They didn't ""take anything"". It was literally sent to them. The government sent it to them for three reasons: 

1. The fascist army were less than 100km away and already publicly threatening to raid the vaults and steal the gold

2. The anarchists were less than 1km away and already publicly threatening to raid the vaults and steal the gold

3. The government was already knee-deep in debt to Russia for all the ""free help"", and Russia threatened to stop sending help until payments started. As the only power who appeared interested in the government side winning, it made sense to send it there rather than let it disappear in France.

&gt; They took Spanish gold reserves and then attempted to turn Spain into their puppet.

Yeah well, there were very few actual USSR-liking communists in Spain. But let's see how it went for each political group, by order of extremism:

* The fascists. They got help from quite a few European industrial powers, very low interest money from other powers. Despite not being that many they simply win the war.

* The anarchists. Completely ignored by everyone save for a few volunteers. Huge numbers and yet completely reduced to ashes by the end of the war. 

* The socialists. They got ignored by every western power. Many end up in (nonNazi) concentration camps in France. Non-relevant. 

* The communists. They got ""help"" from the URSS. Thus despite their low numbers they basically quickly come to dominate as the 2nd power in the war.

5399,"The problem remains that the EU cannot put in a border of any kind, Ireland has been crystal clear that there will not be a hard border, and the UK will not put in a hard border for similar reasons to Ireland. 

What the EU has been saying is that there is no easy way to get rid of the need for customs checks if the UK and EU are not in a customs union and don't harmonise various other aspects related to goods, and that's true. There has to be a UK/EU agreement if you want a totally frictionless border. In the event that the UK leaves with no-deal however (because obviously the WA does deal with this issue) then it is no need for the UK and EU to agree an approach, Ireland will have to take measures to protect the Customs union, and the UK will have to protect its internal market, but it is up to them how they do that, and given issues around having a hard border, and the scope for cooperation, and given Ireland is an Island, the result will not be a border, it'll likely be an initial fudge followed by a slew of bilateral approaches to ensure that customs checks are carried out, goods are appropriately assessed, tariffs are paid and standards are adhered to.

Again, just in a practical sense, who is going to put in a hard border, and who is going to enforce it?

5409,"According to a report by Reporters Without Borders, the Federal Ministry of the Interior, headed by Horst Seehofer (CSU), has plans to monitor media houses, publishing houses, radio stations and independent journalists.

A draft bill by the Ministry of the Interior wants to extend the powers of secret services: This would also allow domestic and foreign secret services to hack journalists' servers, computers and smartphones. With the help of certain software, the secret services could, for example, view encrypted communications or search the servers covertly for digital data; stored documents, browser histories and conversation recordings would thus be accessible.

The use of so-called statestrojans has been permitted in principle since 2017, but use against media is explicitly excluded from this - editorial secrecy is also to be protected digitally. This could change with the plans of the Federal Ministry of the Interior: If the secret services consider their interest in the information to be obtained to be more serious than the possible damage to freedom of the press, digital searches will be permitted, writes Reporters Without Borders. Such online searches could be used, for example, to establish the identity of journalistic sources. 
The bill would also pave the way for monitoring encrypted communication between media professionals and sources: On a court order, messenger services would be forced to make the communication of their customers available to the authorities in a legible, i.e. unencrypted form. In addition, it would be permitted to retrieve booking data from research trips by train or rental car.

An ""almost adventurous"" project
The draft for a ""law for the harmonisation of the constitutional protection law"" had become known by a publication on the page netzpolitik.org. The NGO Reporters Without Borders criticised the project: ""This would fall one of the pillars of freedom of the press in Germany, the editorial secret"". The managing director of the organisation, Christian Mihr, called on Interior Minister Seehofer to ""immediately stop the plans of his ministry"". 
Representatives of the Grand Coalition reacted with astonishment to the Interior Ministry's plans: ""Should there be such plans, they would contradict the Digital Agenda and the previous decision-making position of the Federal Government"", said Thomas Jarzombek (CDU), CDU deputy, to the Handelsblatt. The SPD digital politician Jens Zimmermann described the proposals to the newspaper as ""downright adventurous"".

WASHINGTON — The Trump administration has moved to punish Huawei on national security grounds amid a bitter trade dispute with China. But in Europe, the world's largest telecommunications equipment maker has received a different reception.

Last month, the Netherlands' leading wireless carrier chose Huawei to provide equipment for its next-generation 5G wireless network. The carrier, KPN, insisted the choice was based on quality. But Huawei had another advantage: price.

Huawei underbid the existing vendor, Swedish firm Ericsson, by 60 percent, according to two industry officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter — offering a price that wouldn't even cover the cost of parts.

The company can afford to provide such steep discounts in part because it has a silent partner: the Chinese government. Huawei gets hundreds of millions of dollars in annual subsidies and, together with another Chinese firm, is guaranteed a majority share of the domestic market, the world's largest.

At the same time, Huawei's customers in the developing world can take advantage of loans at below-market interest rates, drawing on a staggering $100 billion line of credit at state-owned banks — a level of government financial support that is unheard of for a Western company.

""Huawei's the poster child for China's state capitalism,"" said James Lewis, a tech policy expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

Over the past decade, Huawei has made similar inroads in Germany, France, Britain, Italy, Canada and throughout the developing world, offering good products at prices telecom carriers can't resist and with which rivals can't compete.

But despite Washington's warnings that Huawei equipment could be used to aid Chinese espionage or sabotage, in Europe the company is moving to expand its foothold in the 5G landscape. In the process, it's undercutting competitors in ways that distort the market, analysts say, while stoking fears that its access could be exploited by the Chinese government to disrupt or spy on the ultrafast platforms that will power the Internet of Things, self-driving cars, military operations and more.

Still, even European officials sympathetic to the administration's security concerns are wary of barring Huawei. They worry that as part of any future trade agreement between the United States and China, President Donald Trump could agree to water down an export ban recently imposed on the company.

""Europe's biggest fear is that the U.S. will cut a separate deal with China and leave Europe hanging,"" said Hosuk Lee-Makiyama, director of a Brussels-based think tank, the European Center for International Political Economy.

The United States has severely restricted Huawei's presence in American networks, banning its components from U.S. government systems and those that contract with the government. Huawei has sued the Trump administration over the ban and on Wednesday asked a court to expedite the case. Meanwhile all four major U.S. carriers — AT&amp;T, Verizon, Sprint and T-Mobile — also have pledged not to use Huawei products in their 5G networks.

But in Europe, where the United States has key military bases and important intelligence-sharing alliances, American officials are alarmed by the prospect of a Chinese company supported by an authoritarian government in Beijing providing technology that will underpin the next digital revolution.

Over the past year, U.S. officials have waged an intense campaign to persuade European partners that Huawei poses an unacceptable security risk. They point to Justice Department indictments accusing the company of stealing intellectual property and violating U.S. sanctions on Iran. Feeding suspicions, Poland this year arrested a Chinese employee of Huawei on allegations of spying for China.

Of particular concern, officials say, is that Huawei is beholden to a 2017 law requiring Chinese citizens and companies to assist China's security agencies in carrying out intelligence work. And, they note, the Chinese government for years has waged massive economic espionage against Western countries.

Some governments have signaled their willingness to take a middle road — barring Huawei components from their networks' ""core,"" which they consider sensitive because it contains the routers and switches that handle massive volumes of traffic, but allowing them in some portion of the ""edge,"" which comprises what they say are the less sensitive radio antennas that carry signals to the core from phones and other devices.

But in 5G, these antennas will become ubiquitous and carry more computing power. Housed in cases the size of pizza boxes and affixed to street poles and buildings, they will enable super-speedy connections to all manner of devices — smartphones, highway traffic sensors, virtual reality goggles. Thus, U.S. officials argue, the distinction between the core and edge has eroded with 5G, and Huawei must be banned from the entire system.

The government in Beijing says it expects Chinese companies to follow export control rules and observe the laws of the countries in which they do business. It has denied it hacks foreign networks for commercial advantage. And Huawei has said it does not build ""back doors"" in its products and would never help China spy on other countries.

- — -

The situation has forced European partners to navigate this standoff between the United States and China, and it illustrates how the economic might that Beijing has built over the past four decades in Europe and elsewhere is creating an unprecedented challenge for Washington.

In May, Trump granted his commerce secretary the power to bar Americans from buying foreign technology that might open U.S. networks to ""potentially catastrophic effects."" Though Huawei was not named in the executive order, it clears the way for an eventual commercial ban on the firm, which booked $105 billion in sales last year. The more immediate and consequential move was a Commerce Department ban on the export of American technology and materials to Huawei without government approval.

Taken together, the measures have intensified the pressure on Beijing as the United States confronts what Washington views as a blended threat to the global digital economy and to its own national security.

""It's important that the American people know that we're standing up for their interests around the world and we're not shying away from articulating what is in our national interests,"" said Robert Strayer, deputy assistant secretary of state for cyber and international communications and information policy.

""We're trying to bring all countries around the world on this learning path about how important 5G is and what it will mean for our future economic prosperity and how important it is that we secure it,"" he said.

- — -

For Huawei, the 5G play is in Europe, analysts say. That's the only high-end market open to it. Huawei is one of only three major suppliers of 5G equipment in Europe — Sweden's Ericsson and Finland's Nokia are the others — and it is ""desperate to dominate 5G in Europe,"" said Lewis, of the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

Some allies have sided with the United States. Huawei is effectively shut out of Australia and Japan, and a number of European security officials agree with the United States on the potential risk of Chinese espionage and network sabotage.

""The problem is not really about the company,"" said Norbert Röttgen, a German member of parliament who shares U.S. security concerns. ""The problem is with the relationship between Huawei and the Chinese state. It's about the trustworthiness of the Communist Party and the Chinese state, whether they are to be expected to exert influence on Huawei....""",,/r/europe/comments/bug22l/as_us_bars_huawei_europe_cant_resist_5g_deals/epbkssd/,jayfreeze7,1559143969

No, that is incorrect.  This the economic fallacy that drove mercantilism.  It is intuitive and also quite wrong.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercantilism

&gt; Mercantilism is a national economic policy that is designed to maximize the exports of a nation. Mercantilism was dominant in modernized parts of Europe from the 16th to the 18th centuries[1] before falling into decline, although some commentators argue[2] that it is still practiced in the economies of industrializing countries in the form of economic interventionism.[3][4][5][6][7]
&gt;
&gt; It promotes government regulation of a nation's economy for the purpose of augmenting state power at the expense of rival national powers. Mercantilism includes a national economic policy aimed at accumulating monetary reserves through a positive balance of trade, especially of finished goods. Historically, such policies frequently led to war and also motivated colonial expansion.[8] 

-

&gt; England began the first large-scale and integrative approach to mercantilism during the Elizabethan Era (1558–1603). An early statement on national balance of trade appeared in Discourse of the Common Weal of this Realm of England, 1549: ""We must always take heed that we buy no more from strangers than we sell them, for so should we impoverish ourselves and enrich them.""[11]

-

&gt; Scholars debate over why mercantilism dominated economic ideology for 250 years.[38] One group, represented by Jacob Viner, sees mercantilism as simply a straightforward, common-sense system whose logical fallacies remained opaque to people at the time, as they simply lacked the required analytical tools.
&gt;
&gt; The second school, supported by scholars such as Robert B. Ekelund, portrays mercantilism not as a mistake, but rather as the best possible system for those who developed it. This school argues that rent-seeking merchants and governments developed and enforced mercantilist policies. Merchants benefited greatly from the enforced monopolies, bans on foreign competition, and poverty of the workers. Governments benefited from the high tariffs and payments from the merchants. Whereas later economic ideas were often developed by academics and philosophers, almost all mercantilist writers were merchants or government officials.[39] 

One wants to trade where trade would occur without barriers, barring externalities like national security.  The gains occur because one leverages [comparative advantage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_advantage):

&gt; The law or principle of comparative advantage holds that under free trade, an agent will produce more of and consume less of a good for which they have a comparative advantage.[1] Comparative advantage is the economic reality describing the work gains from trade for individuals, firms, or nations, which arise from differences in their factor endowments or technological progress.[2] In an economic model, agents have a comparative advantage over others in producing a particular good if they can produce that good at a lower relative opportunity cost or autarky price, i.e. at a lower relative marginal cost prior to trade.[3] One shouldn't compare the monetary costs of production or even the resource costs (labor needed per unit of output) of production. Instead, one must compare the opportunity costs of producing goods across countries.[4]
&gt;
&gt; David Ricardo developed the classical theory of comparative advantage in 1817 to explain why countries engage in international trade even when one country's workers are more efficient at producing every single good than workers in other countries. He demonstrated that if two countries capable of producing two commodities engage in the free market, then each country will increase its overall consumption by exporting the good for which it has a comparative advantage while importing the other good, provided that there exist differences in labor productivity between both countries.[5][6] Widely regarded as one of the most powerful[7] yet counter-intuitive[8] insights in economics, Ricardo's theory implies that comparative advantage rather than absolute advantage is responsible for much of international trade. 

Acts like this pass for political reasons: it permits the administration to transfer money from the public to politically-connected industry and is more-popular with the public than taxation and writing a check to said industry would be.

5508,"&gt; When did I make fun of Serbia's military history? 

Most Albanians usually make fun of Serbian military history, so when I said ""you"" I meant Albanians.

&gt; But judging by one of your other comments calling us a joke of a nation 

Let me apologize if I offended you, the insult was pointed towards Kosovo Albanians and the guy who said that ""serbs and winning in the same sentence. you have lost every war you have fought since 1912"".

I appreciate the list you made, but I really gotta ask you, do you seriously consider Kosare a win? I mean, KLA had NATO air support and artillery support from Albania and you still didn't manage to advance into Kosovo. So you had absolute air and artillery support while the number of soldiers was roughly the same and you still couldn't break the second line of defense.

&gt; The KLA sought to enter [Kosovo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosovo) from Albania and cut off of the communication routes of the [Yugoslav Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yugoslav_Army), and also take over of the region of [Metohija](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metohija).  After days of heavy fighting, the Yugoslav Army kept the KLA from  advancing into Kosovo. KLA insurgents managed to take the Košare outpost  following a massive artillery barrage by the Albanian Army and NATO  airstrikes of Yugoslav strategic sites, but were unable to break the  Yugoslav Army's second line of defense.  

And just for the sake of your fellow Albanians who think the Serbian military history is a joke here is a similar list:

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nemanji%C4%87\_dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nemanji%C4%87_dynasty)

The Nemanjić dynasty managed to transform Serbia from a small principality inside the Byzantine empire to the Serbian Empire which controlled almost the whole Balkan in less than 200 years. Some historians speculate that the Emperor Dušan was ready to attack Constantinopole, but he unexpectedly died while being only 47 years old (but that is just a theory).

&amp;#x200B;

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle\_of\_Kosovo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Kosovo)

The most famous event in Serbian history along with the WW1. Serbian army managed to hold a few times bigger Ottoman army and even kill the sultan, which delayed their process of conquering Europe for a few years.

&amp;#x200B;

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First\_Serbian\_Uprising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Serbian_Uprising)

Serbs managed to free from Turkish occupation and defend from 4 times bigger army for almost 10 years. Even Napoleon himself called the leader of the uprising, Karadjordje, a great commander. The uprising directly caused the Second uprising, which resulted in Serbian autonomy and later independence.

&amp;#x200B;

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkan\_Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkan_Wars)

Serbia and the other allies freed the rest of their territory which was still under the Ottoman occupation and finally pushed Turks out of Europe (except Istanbul). Serbia increased its territory 2 times, and also mostly thanks to these wars Albania got independence in 1912 (otherwise it would happen later probably).

&amp;#x200B;

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbian\_Campaign\_of\_World\_War\_I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbian_Campaign_of_World_War_I)

Serbia alone won the first two battles against A-H, a 50 times bigger country, which were the first victories for the Allied powers (the battles on Cer and Kolubara are to this days taught in many military schools because they are strategic masterpieces). Later Germany and Bulgaria joined the war and we couldn't fight against the 3 much much stronger countries alone, so we retreated in Greece and waited for reinforcements, and eventually won. Also at the end of the war Serbian flag waved on the White house, making Serbia the only country in history besides the US and France that had its flag on the White house.

&amp;#x200B;

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World\_War\_II\_in\_Yugoslavia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II_in_Yugoslavia)

Yugoslav partisans managed to free the country from the German and Bulgarian occupation.

&gt; Why do you think the rest of the EU wont start to concentrate in one of the other financial hubs, as it has done with the UK?

London was a great financial hub long before the EU was even a thing. The EU added to London's prestige but it is not the reason for it's general preeminence. London came first and the [Big Bang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang_(financial_markets)) was far more significant for London's rise. 

It will never happen within the EU, precisely because the EU never had all that much to with London's global status. It's not some gift they can arbitrarily bestow on whichever city they wish. Moreover, the European cities will never cooperate amongst themselves to create a single rival to London (look at how they all squabbled between each other and fought over London's scraps in the aftermath of the referendum, completely uncoordinated).",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/bu1kfv/brexit_sees_london_fall_behind_new_york_as_top/epb24af/,MyFavouriteAxe,1559136694

Obviously, the elderly and people with health problems should have aid for as long as they need. I'm talking about young and capable. People aren't children that need to be babysat by the government, we are resourceful and we find ways to survive. People survive just fine in countries with little or no welfare, they don't just sit around and starve to death. I will never in a thousand years believe that a person living in a first world country can't find a way to make a living for over 2 years.

5623,"&gt;That sounds like as if you are already preparing your Brexit success story. ""See? We still have a positive GDP growth and we aren't eating grass! Told you everything would be fine!""

Really? My success criteria is quite a bit higher. My point is that the predictions from the pro-EU side are so overblown in some areas (largely exaggerations or taking what is predicted to be a short term issue, broadening and extrapolating it) that it's feeding a false narriative. 

&gt;No one says that the UK will turn into the Irish famine of 1845. 

We literally have people saying that once we are out of the EU there will be generalise food shortages. You had people stocking up on dried and tinned goods before the expected exit date (even though the risk was that there might be border delays, leading to some fresh, perishable goods being mildly less abundant in the very short term..).

&gt;The UK will likely even make quick progress in fields where they don't rely heavily on comprehensive trade agreements. But the industries and people that rely on production and trade of goods are facing difficult times when tariffs and quotas apply to the goods that they hope to sell and the imports they need. And possible investors will look at that too.

If the UK leaves with no-deal there are some relatively small risks to the economy, absolutely, and those can only really be resolved by a UK government that can give a decent idea about the direction it intends to take, implement a decent commercial policy and work toward trade deals with the UK's larger partners. But even there you had predictions of massive unemployment (which is extremely unlikely) that Frankfurt or Paris would outstrip London (that's just not a thing) or indeed that the UK would be cut off from EU trade (Again, not going to happen). 

So again, the bar is set so low, the expectations so divorced from reality in some areas, that the expectation vs reality of the UK leaving are very different.",United Kingdom - Personally vouched for by /u/colourfox,/r/europe/comments/buauya/brexit_is_vaccine_against_euroskepticism_says_tusk/epakzsp/,-ah,1559129603

Space exploration is one part of the overall human advancement in science and technology, and a crucial one. It offers solutions and it costs *very little* in the grand scale of things.

You might just as well reject trying to cure cancer or high-speed rail or *any number of projects* because someone, somewhere doesn't have enough to eat.

And I repeat, we'll need space to save the Earth. In fact, key pieces of evidence in climate research were brought by your hated space tech. Satellites monitor the climate, glaciers, oceans and help us understand what's happening, get a clear picture of what is happening to this planet. Without space exploration, we'd be more ignorant and far less able to act.

5836,"&gt;If a party is out of date, then new ones get their opportunity. 

Yes, but now the old parties, especially the CDU start to show their true colors. Condemning free speech on the internet, plowing ahead with coal industries and only vaguely promising to close them down by 2038 - a date that is far, far too late - and supporting censorship initiatives like article 17 (formerly known as article 13). The CDU barely got any votes from people under 30, and they know it. But instead of changing their party officials and their way of doing things, they now try to supress young voters even more. This has now become a generational war of ideology, with teenager and young adults pittet against their parents.

Do you know about the ""Friday for future"" protests in Germany and Europe in general? Children don't go to school on those and instead protest against climate policies or the lack thereof. The reaction from the CDU was basically ""you know, it's technically illegal to not go to school here..."", while the reaction from the FDP (libertarians) was ""okay cool, but you should leave politics to the profis"".

This is the mindset in Germany now. ""Young people know nothing, we'll suck this continent dry and then just die, have fun fixing that"". Another golden quote from the CDU (or was it the CSU?): ""Once they start earning their own money, we'll see if they still want that carbon tax.""

Regarding the UK and Europe... There's something very wrong here in the UK. The EU isn't too blame for the woes. We have a very angry society, and I'm not sure they really know why. Brexit is the symptom, but what is the cause?

Unfortunately I fear people will be mislead into believing the EU is the cause of their woes long after the UK has left. The fact that so many Brits believe the EU is ""holding us hostage"" if symptomatic of this delusion.

In many respects, I don't think it matters whether the UK leaves or not at this stage. There's so much that can't be reversed for many years (organisations relocating or reorganising supply chain). If we have a second referendum and remain, we're still left with a very large amount of the population who feel very unhappy.

When I say unhappy, I don't mean with the EU (although that's how it manifests). They're angry and feel without power or voice. Leaving the EU won't change that.

5852,"&gt; 80% of Europes financial business is in London. Only 12% of London's financial industry is dealing with Europe. It was the globes financial center before the EU (also before both world wars btw).

Actually 25% of London's financial industry is dealing with the EU, and a hard brexit could potentially lead to a loss of that.

And it's really not that difficult to imagine ripples affecting part of the rest. There's do doubt that London will still be a financial centre, but it could drastically shrink.

&gt;This won't happen though because there is no where else on earth that has the markets that London does and no where else that can run them.

The US financial markets are bigger in NY. Tokyo is really close, and if you're looking at from a purely international POV then China is far larger than the UK ... and France is roughly 60% the size of UKs.

It's really not as if London is some suuuuper unique place anymore. If you look at how large a percentage of GDP it contributes to it's only around $60 billion - the same as the rest of the UK financial services combined.

Singapore, France, Frankfurt, Dublin, Amsterdam, Hong Kong, NY - they are all experiencing a larger growth than London, and if Brexit ends up badly it could easily turn the tide.

&gt;There are lots of cities who want to take London's business. The problem is none of them can. The only ones who would take London's business is New York or Hong Kong who are the real rivals. It will never be a European city

That's just not correct. Plenty of financial business has *already* left London and headed to mainland Europe. If that trend continues then you could easily see Germany or France come out as an equal.

Like I said ... France's finance sector is already way up there at around 60% of the UKs size. You act as if a quarter leaving the UK is nothing, but it's pretty damn significant.",,/r/europe/comments/bu5esl/uk_by_far_the_biggest_enabler_of_global_corporate/ep9spt5/,upvotesthenrages,1559115574

5929,"&gt;No, they don't generally. Many require equivalence or some level of mutual recognition. London does far more with RoW than within the EU.

Why do people confuse EU with a federation or a customs union? While not the entire financial sector, the services will have unexpected consequences.. In reality people simply still expect a deal at least for that sector will be reached... If a no-deal is in place you'll see a mass-exodus of financial services; Most have already registered a company in France or Germany, just in case;

&gt; It is not something they can simply replace overnight. 

EU actually monitored and took some minor preparations for itself but that preparations had nothing to do with Brexit negociations (as opposed to the UK where it has everything to do with Brexit negociations); Not to mention that EU remains with the required infrastraction and regulations;

&gt; London financial services is about 3% of UK GDP, Europe is about 15% fo that if I recall correctly, so 0.45% of GDP.  

Financial services are not important (only) because they generate profits... 

&gt;  In addition to clearing nearly all euro denominated swaps, and handling more euros than the rest of the EU combined, London is also used for 80% of sovereign issuance. 

And here is where London has all the leverage.. The one time (long-worked) leverage... But it's also UK's weakness.. It's absurd to believe that a city, a service or a country can't be replaced.. 

It's in everyones advantage not to replace it, thus the leverage.. But once they forced their ""clients"" to move on it will never be the same again... thus it's a weakness;

&gt;You won't get any argument from me. Now, why is the EU unwilling to ensure that this mutually beneficial relationship continues?

Are we missing something? Isn't UK the one that is refusing to continue?

 

&gt;Which is shit advice. It hasn't stopped the EU itself, and a handful of member states, opportunistically attempting to poach and steal whatever business they can from London. It's remarkably petty.

They didn't.. Preparations.. Those services that you said can't be replaced over night will just continue existing over nigh.. In Paris, Frankfurt, etc..",Europe,/r/europe/comments/bu1kfv/brexit_sees_london_fall_behind_new_york_as_top/ep9dsul/,SmokeyCosmin,1559108536

so by international law germany is no longer required to pay reparations. but i doubt the poles (or the greek beforehand) come at it through a lens of the law, but rather that of morality. germany is morally obliged to pay reparations. and i can fully understand poles feeling like they got shafted by germany here. but i have a feeling that the window for such a settlement has past unfortunately as the PiS now makes claims that germany can't realistically pay and any concessions from the german side would just lend more validity to the position of PiS.

The British pound plummeted by 50% largely due to the fears of what brexit will do to the financial market in the UK.

You're being willfully ignorant here.

If the UK ends up in a no-deal situation then those financial ties will completely sever. Even in a deal situation things will move from the UK to the EU.

The reason London is one of the largest banking cities on the planet is *because* of the EU. Without it it's just the tiny UK market.

5997,"While the UK imports a high proportion of her food, IIRC by dollar value it's mostly domestically-produced.

https://www.countryfile.com/news/can-the-uk-feed-itself-after-brexit/

&gt;The UK grows 61% of the food it eats, according to the National Farming Union (NFU),Tim Lang, Professor of Food Policy at City, University of London, and DEFRA’s Agriculture in the UK paper (July 2017). Government sources sometimes quote a figure of 75% but this excludes ‘non-indigenous’ items such as exotic fruit – bananas and mangoes, tea, coffee and spices – foods that cannot be grown (either at all or on a meaningful scale) in the UK.

That being said, I suppose that it might decline post-Brexit.  The EU has relatively-protective agriculture policy, which I expect is bad for the (net food importing) UK on the whole, but good if you're a British farmer in a protected area.

&gt;Asked if it would be possible to maintain farm profitability under a public money for public goods system of support, Dr Petetin said: “A lot of farms are currently profitable only because of direct payments coming from the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP).
&gt;
&gt;“From reading the agriculture consultation, it seems to me, and this is going to sound harsh, Defra has made a choice that the 25 per cent of farms which are at the bottom and are not doing very well will perhaps disappear.

-

&gt;“I would also say farmers are really protected by EU tariffs. Once the UK is removed from this bubble, life outside the EU is even worse for farmers because of price volatility.
&gt;
&gt;“The price of commodities changes on a daily basis, which is not reflected as much within the EU because of the protective bubble. UK farmers are going to have to compete and it is going to be very harsh.”",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/btxrxm/labour_will_demand_second_brexit_referendum_on/ep9g6pj/,vokegaf,1559109597
