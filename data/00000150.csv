One would be that the use of heirless property for the benefit of needy Holocaust survivors is suggested in the Terezin declaration, the document that Poland and almost all other EU countries signed in 2009.

The other is that all Polish Jews were stripped of their assets and posessions, and therefore, all Polish Jews and their descendants are entitled to reparations or restitutions of their estates. The problem here is that it is almost impossible to do this individually. The amount of victims and the largely missing papertrail makes it impossible to accurately determine the posessions of all Jewish Poles before the Holocaust. Instead, the idea  – and the practice of all other EU countries – is to determine the possessions under control of the government as a direct consequence of the Holocaust. These can then be restituted or reparations provided to all Jewish Poles and their descendands that suffered from the Holocaust.",,/r/europe/comments/cmgw96/us_senators_want_poland_to_pay_victims_of_nazi/ew5nkgk/,Markleft,1565140588

As an added bonus, I’m pretty sure its basic economics to calculate cost per unit, but more on that later. Just the feeling that you seem to think otherwise kinda proves to me all I need to know.

Anyway, I do agree on money being removed is money being removed, basic investment theory. You pay something, and hope to get a return. I’m also not arguing against that, but the way you argue is flawed. You focus on the investment, but fail to put it in perspective while also forget about the return.

However, I do understand why you don’t want to talk about the actual cost per capita, calculated against their share of the gross national income, but your reluctance doesn’t make my argument less valid. With a more relevant frame, the UK citizen was the eight largest net contributer to the EU budget.

That said, calculating the net contribution is only interesting if weighted versus the net gain of being a member,.. and I’m going to be lazy enough to argue in your way here. The UK net contribution to EU was £9 billion according to fullfacts.com. A lot of money, sure, but Confederation of British Influence estimated the net benefit to be somewhere in the ballpark of £62-78 billion, or a net gain around £1000 per UK citizen.

So yeah...  in absolute numbers, the UK is a large net contributer, but it doesn’t make the membership a net loss. However, the £1000 per capita is still not “that much”, and I bet you believe that the UK can regain it plus another £1000 per capita of expected benefits connected to growth within the European energy, transport and digital service market... by making a trade deal with Trump. I heard he likes to give every country a fair deal. A great deal. A profitable deal. For the US, that is :) but you’re only wagering £2000 per capita or £8000 per year for a family of four. Pocket change. You must either be filthy rich, or extremely confident that a Trump deal will be better than the EU, even though you fucked over the GFA.

No hard feelings. I wish you all the luck. But don’t come back crying if your bet fails.

Most countries in Europe have realised that unity is necessary if we want to be relevant in the 21st century. I think the UK leaving will go a long way in creating the equal treatment of countries (no rebate) which will furthermore be supplemented by the fact that new members have to adopt to Euro. 

Insititutionally, I hope to see a transnational voting system and truly European parties in the future but I have no idea how such a system could look like without squashing the small EU countries. 
Imo, some of the hate on the EU council by federalists is undeserved as it effectively acts as a controlling mechanism like a senate in bicameral systems (though more qualified majority decisions would be nice). The commission could use a rotating member system to decrease overlap but this could be messier than what we currently have. 

I'd love to see an EU army which would drastically increase European leverage and costs compared to 28 separate armies but I think making decisions on when to use it would be extremely controversial especially when a country voted against participation but is forced to go to war.

&gt; You can't really make a nation out of nothing. It feels artificial and forced and people will start feeling that they aren't free in their own country.

Well, India was basically formed out of ""nothing"". A united India wasn't really a thing except during the Maurya Empire for about one century around the time of Ancient Rome started going. There were rather big entities similar to what we had with France, Spain etc, but nothing as a united India. And then it was ""united"" for about one century by the British and now they don't have really problems with being Indians. 

Bulgarians and Finns have as much in common as somebody from Karela and somebody from Rajasthan or Western Bengal. They speak completely different languages, have different historical experience, same religion (as it is the case of Bulgaria and Finland too though) as well as social norms. PS: in case of religion, since you probably refer to the fact that Finns are more protestants while Bulgarians are orthodox, in Hinduism every region has basically their own traditions only that it is more granular since there is no central authority.

The main reason is that the EU doesn't have a big boogeyman as the Indians had with the UK, plus the EU is much more recent than India. Give it time and people will see it as the status quo.

408,"I mean, the current state of no deal was sort of inevitable anyway. You've got 51% of the country who voted for something because of all kinds of various vague bullshit promises, just darts thrown at the wall until enough of them stuck, whether they were on target or not. So when it finally comes down for this tiny majority of the country, many of which no longer support it anyway, to negotiate what they actually wanted the deal to be, it's never actually going to happen. Everyone has their idea of what the deal should be, all those ideas are different, and since only 48% of the country (or whatever) even support the idea at all anymore, of course none of the deals are going to get anywhere near majority support. Had the original vote had a 70% threshold or something, then maybe you'd have a chance of negotiating something a majority could have gotten behind, but it's just never going to happen with such a small group trying to guide the whole country to their doom. So yes, I think that the current situation can be blamed entirely on brexit voters and advocates, because there's no way that a consensus solution ever would have been built when the original campaign was based on throwing out whatever lies and fearmongering they could and never having a plan to begin with.

420,"&gt; No, of course it isn't. But there are several areas where UK and EU interests align and indeed the EU wants somethings from the UK in the same way that the UK wants some things from the EU. That's why there is a negotiated WA out there

Indeed. The WA is supposed to close obligations two parties have to each other. I don't know how much it is played over there, but many EU officials says that even if you leave with no deal, EU is not going to start trade negotiations, without obligations of the WA being met. 

&gt; The point with leverage ... So the question is whether either side will budge to get an acceptable agreement ....

According to EU this process already took place, it is not going to be repeated every time PM changes, especially when PM does not come from elections and when it seems to be that his power in parliament will be even weaker than that of May's.

&gt; I'm not sure what that's supposed to prove..

That there are some that think of the ""good old days"" of the empire. Though prove is kind of a strong statement, indicates seems better suited to me. 

&gt; No, it didn't. If you look back at the discussions over the last 5 years...
That was Chequers more or less, where UK wanted free movement of goods (I am not sure about capital and services, ofc labor was not there), as well as a tailored custom union where some products would follow EU regulations but some others not without a border in NI creating a backdoor for for non-EU approved products. The point that things would pretty much the same but without the FoM was something Brexit advertised before the referendum.

&gt; ...That's what negotiations are, asking for X in return for Y. If you want to call that cherry picking then fine, but it's hardly unreasonable.

No I think I said that it not unreasonable for the UK to get whatever it gets. It is unreasonable to expect the EU will satisfy those demands and then blame EU for that. 
The thing is that X and Y are not equal, neither in quantity nor quality. That is why EU is a negotiating position of power, simple example: market of more than 400m people vs market of 60m. On the other hand EU is nowhere near having the intelligence network UK has. 

&gt; I mean, the EU deciding not to do what the UK wants is the EU's fault. 

lol that is what I am talking about. UK for some reason thinks that somehow EU owes it to UK to satisfy its demands, and cannot comprehend how EU can say no. Reminds some kind of super model not used to hearing no. 

&gt; The UK has specifically rejected single market membership, it is leaving the political project in its entirety, no-longer taking part in common foreign policy, is no longer represented by the EU in international bodies, no-longer has access to EU courts and so on. Those are all benefits aren't they?

EU doesn't really have a common foreign policy. Look at Venezuela, or Russia, access to EU courts can be considered both benefit and obligation, the fact that UK wants out of EU courts makes it an obligation and not a benefit in the eyes of the UK. So I don't think that this proves that UK did not want the benefits of the UK.

&gt; And that's fair. But if the EU doesn't want to negotiate, and the UK won't agree, then that's an impasse....

It doesn't work like that though... First you must know what you want, we cannot have negotiations leading to agreements that don't get through parliament. These negotiations are taking up resources, we cannot have this infinite cycle where we have a deal, you later reject it and then start looking for a new one. UK first should figure out what it wants and then start negotiations. 

&gt; That's a very good point, and a very real risk. I suppose the point then is whether the EU is happy with no-deal being agreed or not, or whether it is willing to try to continue discussions. That is a choice for the EU.

EU has made its position clear. EU would not be happy with a no-deal, but if UK chooses to not honor the WA then that's what we have. 

&gt; The UK is leaving

It has been months since UK is leaving. This prolonged state of being schrodinger's britain (both in and out of the EU) only makes things worse for both business and people. 

&gt; Arguably the best way forward would have been to continue negotiations to see if there was something that could be done. But absent that, yes, the UK should leave either way and the UK and EU can move forward with the UK outside of the EU.

I don't think there is anything left to negotiate. UK should leave as soon as possible, and from that point on build whatever relation EU and UK are going to have.",European Union,/r/europe/comments/cmmsqe/eu_leaders_have_accepted_uk_is_leaving_without_a/ew4uvlk/,I_miss_the_rain,1565118814

494,"&gt; Supporting anyone but the English is usual for the most part (annoyingly)

The whole reason for Brexit in the first place was English nationalism. 

&gt; It has merely marked out in bright red ink the fault-lines that have long been less vividly present – the drifting apart of England and Scotland; the economic and cultural divide between what Anthony Barnett calls “England-without-London” and the rest of the UK (Wales being the obvious anomaly); the social and geographic rifts between the winners and losers of the long Thatcherite revolution. Brexit, in a worst-of-all-worlds moment, brings all of these divisions to a head while doing absolutely nothing to address them. It reveals a polity that cannot create consensus because it lacks a foundation in social consent.

No it hasn’t it has only unmasked underlying issues because those countries no long have things like devaluation to full back on. Like in the past, you also can not blame the euro if countries inside them are not willing to fix their internal problems which are more easy to fix than blaming ‘structural flaws’.

&gt;It was supposed to force a convergence of the different countries but has instead done the opposite

There is no indication that euro area membership has had a negative impact on convergence. On the contrary, each of the 11 new Central and Eastern European member states, which joined the euro after 2004, have been converging at a slightly faster rate than one would have expected given their starting level of income per capita. Moreover, the available projections for the next few years suggest that East- West convergence will continue, and that some North-South convergence might re-start. Moreover, several of the countries severely affected by the euro crisis are now returning to above-average growth, whereas some ‘non-euro Northern’ EU member states are also not growing faster than the euro area.

Huge part of this ""internal"" trade is production and assembly of upholstery for automotive industry.

We're such a powerhouse in this regard because back in PRL, when new industrial centres were built and populated, there was this huge thing about finding reliable jobs for miners/factory and shipyard workers wifes. Those jobs were in huge part seamstresses. 
Łódź, Śląsk, Dolny Śląsk, Trójmiasto, Szczecin. Think about the rapidly grown industry centres of this period, and the diffusion of tailors in Poland suddenly makes much more sense.

Fasttrack to mines closures in free market economy, and you suddenly have situations like my hometown of Wałbrzych with 19% unemployment.
Thanks to automotive industry we're currently at nominal ~5% unemployment, and realistically a workers shortage. Toyota, Tristone, Faurecia as well as paintshops and smaller suppliers are currently building and gearing up for expansion.

German companies fucking saved us. We've had ex-miners digging ""biedaszyby"" - makeshift shallow mines where they dug up coal deposits in the parks throughout the city.

The Swiss and the Germans both profiteered off the crimes that the Germans wrought upon the Jews, and no amount of complaining about it will stop that. Especially all the Nazis that still occupied government positions after the war.

&gt;I made my point clear from the very beginning. You want to play white knight without acknowledgingyour own issues. I won't let you, as much as you beg for it.

You're actually retarded. Britain, Russia, Zanzibar, Mexico, have fuck all to do with Germans enacting a Holocaust upon the Jewish people and then refusing to pay reparations for it. Your point was that they shouldn't because mUh WuT aBoUt OtHeR CoUnTrY as if what other countries do suddenly validates your retarded position that Germany shouldn't pay for its crimes. You're literally defending Nazism.

&gt;No, you are trying to claim an authority you do not possess.

Who the fuck made you the queen of sheba? Your dumb ass isn't going to stop anyone from pointing out that Germany should pay the victims of the Holocaust that it committed against the Jews.

&gt;But I inherited some jewish/polish stuff. Right

Your country inherited the wealth it robbed, just as mine did. Stop trying to play the victim you mong.

&gt;Just that Germany DID pay Jews and polish

Then why are there victims who still haven't been compensated?

&gt;while you, as a BRit, did nothing of these sorts to your very own victims and yet you come here and try to blame others.

&gt;You are obviously mentally challenged with that simple concept.

This is rich, coming from a guy who apparently forgot the Holocaust ever happened

&gt;I did, and you failed

""Name me **one, only one** other country that **even remotely** did what Germany did in regards to **coming to terms with crimes of the past. One.**""

I did exactly that, not my fault you're moving the goalposts because your phrasing was shit.

&gt;You really are autistic, right? You fail to understand the simplest concepts and then go on constructing your own history of this exchange to make a point nobody understands but yourself.

My man, you must've been deprived of oxygen at birth. I have no other explanation for why you're so deluded about Germany's crimes against the Jews and why you're so butthurt about Germany paying for it. 

All you've ever done in this exchange was dodging responsibility via whataboutism, and trying to deflect the issue back onto *me* because of my flair, simply because you're a Nazi-sympathiser who doesn't like the idea of Germany paying reparations for the crimes it caused. 

""Besides, if your flair checks out as a Brit, you guys are not in the position to throw mud given all the shit you pulled during Empire time. What kind of reperations have you paid? 'nough said."" Whataboutism from the start.

""For the same reason you want me and other German tax payers foot the bill for things that happend long before anybody here was even born. It's really funny how you want to treat yourself differently then what you ask of me. Or do you think that money grows on some kind of magic tree?"" The idea of Germany paying reparations for its crimes doesn't sit well with you.

""And the empire was dissolved even later, with the wealth having gained from it never being returned and still being the foundation of British wealthtoday. Your point being?"" Classic act of deflection

""No, you are acting as if Germany has this pecial duty to pay compensation while all other countries who did their fair share of shit in history are getting of the hook. Very, very convinient."" You again insinuate that you don't like Germany paying reparations for its crimes.

""I did before. You are a Brit. You try to make this morale argument about compensation. Your own country does nothing of that sort.

Let's look at the truth. Every nation has something to do with its neighbours.

The classic move of a racist ethnic nationalist. It's not a game of semantics because by making that move your entailing that these historic people had anything to do with the modern entities we call nation states. You are culturally appropriating history and trying to make Europe the centre. Something you've been doing for hundreds of years. 

Well guess what. Britain doesn't want any part of it. We like being a modern country that does base its entity in ancient fucking history like most of the EU27. 

Look, the fact that we have historic migration patterns in Europe does not mean there is any reason for the UK to welcome you as brothers and sisters today. The very suggestion is ethnic nationalism embodies. As far as we are concerned, your just other countries in an international community, and we have no more reason to favour you then Japan or Peru. 

It's so ironic that you think the British don't remember their history or know all about European history. 

The difference is that for you, with the logic of ethnic nationalism, it's a grounds for closer ties and national integration. 

However, for us, a nation that rejects any notion that ethnic blood ties mean anything whatsoever, European history is a good reason to steer clear of your antiquated and fucked up Eurocentric world view and work towards true modernity and internationalism.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/cmmsqe/eu_leaders_have_accepted_uk_is_leaving_without_a/ew3x6sp/,kingofeggsandwiches,1565097436

One or two kids per class that do not or badly speak the language can be dealt with. Half and more of a class not being able to follow even simple sentences on the other hand produce an enviroment where even those speaking German will hardly learn anything.

I tutored kids for a few years in a part of town where practically no (native) Germans are living and going to school. In theory I should have helped them with Maths and other sciency stuff, in practice there were many instances where I first had to teach the kids a good deal of German beforehand. Even some highschoolers showed a shocking lack of reading comprehension.

Most of those had in common that their teachers were about the only persons frequently speaking German or at least propper German with them. In such an enviroment learning the language is, of course, very difficult.

The EU does have a peace and reconciliation programme for Northern Ireland but there is no provision for it in the EU budget. It is financed from loose change in the drawer of the European Commission.

At least that's what I think is very likely, seeing the populists among the Brexiteers. 

But if we let Britain fall down as hard as possible in the event of a hard Brexit, maybe even with supply bottlenecks, the EU would have a better position to enable a fast reentry of Britain, (a bit like humanitarian aid, so to say) without losing its face and thereby supporting other Exit campaigns in other European States.

&gt;So they were actually under Scandinavian rule, but because of Normandy, that was also heavily influenced by Scandinavians, that does not count?

Do you know anything about English history? I suggest you get started with [Anglo-Normans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Normans).

&gt;that does not count?

It's not about what counts or not, it's about what has left a large legacy and what has not.

&gt;So you are saying the Scandinavian cultural influence on Normandy, was what removed the Scandinavian cultural influence on UK?

Dude you are writing unrelated sentences after another as if you are having a conversation with yourself...

&gt;But that other little nation, that has been under Soviet thumb for how long? has deeper roots to the Nordic countries.

Yes.

&gt;We are even talking about roughly the same time in history..

Same time compared to what?

&gt;But like you did, lets return to geography because as you said, that was what this was about.

That was what one question at the top was about. Don't read more into this.

&gt;So what makes Estonia more Nordic that for example the UK?

Did you read the list I provided? Pretty much all of it.

&gt;It's just water separating us, just like it does Iceland and Faroe Islands, or even Russia.

Indeed, water has been a historical connector, not a divider. However, that does not mean that everywhere across the water the country was necessarily culturally alike.

&gt;You say culture, so I want to know what makes our culture so similar?

Dude, I provided you a relatively long list before. You just took one of them out and said that that's all. Why should I provide more before you have at least acknowledged or negated these items in the list?

&gt;Then you claim the argument is geography..

Dude. That was my answer to one question. What is the matter with you?

&gt;Unfortunately it does not seem like everyone agree with you, but I wish you best of luck in changing that.

981,"&gt;And here we are, with May gone, the UK allegedly (supposedly, possibly, potentially) out of the EU sans deal, taking a much more confrontative stance all of a sudden, doing exactly what it's supposed to do according to a certain faction in Washington.

Except the UK hasn't taken a more aggressive stance toward Iran on anything other than shipping protection. That's sort of the point, the UK could have quite legitimately escalated the situation, that would almost by necessity have drawn the US in, it would certainly have given them an excuse.

I think it is a mistake to see this as the UK pushing closer to a US orbit or indeed the US managing to draw the UK into another confrontation. This is arguably the IRGC pulling levers to put pressure on the Iranian government, and the UK responding fairly proportionally.

The risk of course is that someone on the Iranian side now does something stupid while there are several warships escorting ships, but then the Iranians are usually quite smart about how much pressure to create and where to apply it.",United Kingdom - Personally vouched for by /u/colourfox,/r/europe/comments/cmf47p/uk_joins_forces_with_us_to_protect_ships_in/ew3k9fi/,-ah,1565083205

From what I gather he has been playing poker, trying to test the limits of how far can he go. Ukraine is just another step in a chain of similar actions. And this is good fuel for propaganda, that there are external unfriendly forces which must be dealt with. That there are russians being mistreated where he must intervene. 

I don't doubt for a second that when shit hits the fan in Russia, he will bring out the army against his own people. The state is corrupt enough, the clique in power has no interest in seeing the status quo change.

The only thing he won't risk though is an open conflict with NATO.

The Gas Powerplant are way more expensive (double the price if i remember correctly ), to expansive to survive on the market the energy price is between 4 to 5 ct. GasPp can't produce for that price neither can Windfarms and Solarfarms, despite their prioritizt Stands on the market.


&gt;Next step would be to finally upgrade our energy grid, to bring excess power generated in the north by wind farms down to the south. 

yah, no. The energy grid is constantly upgrade. But the burocratic process from the final planning stage to the first building stage tales 10 years

On top of that comes a lawsuit from every environmental organisation and from each Grünen Mayor under the sun. Because apparently they want the ""green energy plants"" standing around but they don't want to use them.

But it was evident that you knew jack shit about Estonia.

&gt;The actual fuck?

How is that not a reasonable assumption?

&gt;So can you explain to me how you know your culture resembles that of the other Nordic countries, when you as a unknowing tourist visit them?

Besides having visited them, I have enough education on other countries.

&gt;You can assume things about me, but I can't assume things about you?

Assumption of lack of knowledge based on simplistic and at times incorrect statements vs. randomly guessing whether I have ever visited a country or not.

&gt;Well start mentioning the examples of common culture and history you so comfortably expect the rest of us to agree with you upon..

Ok.. How to put it shortly enough to not start writing a long essay: common cultural sphere already during the Viking era with raids and counter-raids (i.e. [Estonian raiders/vikings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhabitants_of_Saaremaa)), participating in Scandinavian civil strives, Danish and Swedish rule, loads of common symbols with Denmark (two coats of arms of Tallinn, national coat of arms of Estonia, legendary origin of the flag of Denmark, name of Tallinn), historical Swedish minority in Estonia, a great number of churches and other establishments named after Scandinavian saints/kings, Falu red-coloured buildings in Western Estonia, traditionally Lutheran society, the basis of Estonian educational system stems from the Swedish era, the ""good old Swedish times"" in national memory, loads of Swedish and Proto-Scandinavian loans in Estonian, Finnish, Swedish and Danish volunteers in the Estonian War of Independence, importance of Midsummer celebrations, semla, ""Yule"", skiing, sauna, island culture, traditional seafaring culture, etc., etc. 

&gt;So naturally nobody knows anything about it, and we should all be quiet and listen to you?

No, people should at least inform themselves of the reasons why a country they don't know much about considers itself Nordic before dissing the idea as ridiculous or some national inferiority/superiority complex.

&gt;Apparently you are alone with that opinion

That's the Estonian national identity though.

&gt;and still need to put up a better argument than ""Uh it's in the North and it's like the same as the other Nordic countries""

1119,"Depends how you define ""poor"". By the official UN definition, there's almost none. The reason being that there are state aid programs to help against poverty… and they not only provide a state-paid appartment and health insurance but also on top of that far more money than the bar for the official UN poverty limit. The only ""downside"" is that these programs expect people to be willing to 

* participate in state-paid programs to address the causes of their problems (e.g. drug therapy if their poverty is related to drug problems … or education / professional training if that's the problem) and
* are willing to take up a job (either that they find themselves or that the state finds for them)

so basically the only people who really are poor are those who not only are unemployed but more importantly willingly choose to not participate in such programs. Some people have an aversion against any form of obligation that would come as a counterpart to getting money.

so how, given the totally small number of actually poor people in Germany, would you get statistics saying otherwise?

Well, there are people and lobbies in Germany who want more money from the state/taxpayers (ideally unconditionally) and who for this reason resort to rhetoric tricks like using a custom re-definition of ""poor"" specially taylor-fit to their agenda of artificially blowing up the numbers of people counted as ""poor"" (in the sense of that special re-definition) That is done by:

* a goal-shifting ""poverty"" bar that is neither set at an specific comparable income nor at an amount determined by what's necessary to cover the needs but at a bar that is RELATIVE to the average income
* ideally combined with an arbitrarily very high percentage, e.g. (such as in the definition used by the lobby group mentioned in the article) at 60% of the average German income.

To show the absurdity of such a propagandistic RELATIVE ""poverty"" definition, let's look at what it entails:

* in a country where EVERYONE has a totally insufficient income (let's say only half of the official UN poverty limit), such a RELATIVE ""poverty"" re-definition would see NOBODY as poor
* conversely, in a rich country where everyone owns superyachts and 50% of people all have earnings of 1 million € a year and the other 50% all have earnings of 3 million € a year well, you guessed it: the 1 Million € people are considered ""poor"" by such a RELATIVE ""poverty"" re-definition

Now the average people don't make millions in Germany either, but with the state aids (available to all Germans and everyone with a legal residency permit) even unemployed people are objectively rich by international standards (e.g. by the official UN poverty definition).

That's how by a simple propagandistic motivated re-definition of a term (here: ""poor"" or ""poverty""), especially with a concept of RELATIVE ""poverty"" (which doesn't actually measure poverty but just whether there are differences, even at a very high level), you can even fake statistics to pretend there would be lots of poor people in Germany.

History basically

For one, estonians are finnic ethnically and linguistically and are distinctly more north/west european culturally than the slavic peoples.

Second, Estonia spent half of the 20th century being occupied by the USSR that organized mass deportations to siberia and actively tried to suppress estonian language and culture in their efforts to russify the area. 

The conflict between finnic peoples and russia goes back centuries, the north-western areas of modern day russia used to belong to several other finnic people groups that eventually got swallowed up by the russian empire.

1215,"Yeah, ok buddy. I work in the city of London, with a lot of investment bankers. I know what is a put. I can guarantee that the mood is NOT the one you describe. 
Firstly, you are partially right. A lot of guys indeed made a lot of money betting on the gbp crash. Disclosure I made a bit a the time, I was late to the party, still managed to catch the tail of the move, but I am no longer trading. A lot of guys are still riding this position as the endless flow of BS from politics just keeps on giving. And you do not need a put to do so when you just want a purely directional position. You have leverage, you simply short and roll leveraged futures. Much cheaper that buying puts and carrying the theta (the time decay in price of an option) after paying a huge premium on the upside, especially in FX where you do not need to short.
Secondly, the but. And it is a big one, most guys in the city are utterly fucked by Brexit. Prop Trader /Hedge fund guys with a mandate to speculate are a tiny tiny tiny portion of people in finance. Most of the business takes place in large scale financial operations such as structuring, M&amp;As, financing, stuff like that. And a lot of this activity is being removed from London to other EU centers. Another very big chunk of finance are asset managers (pensions) and those guys do NOT have a mandate to speculate. They have to invest the money following very tight guidelines, a lot of which are in investments which are getting hammered by Brexit (mostly long terms). It also fucks financing, as let’s imagine I used to borrow money from our Yankee friends to invest in the UK. The British economy was good, and the Americans were happy to lend massively as they trusted our investment in the UK. I was making money from the ROI of the UK investment let’s say 12% and was paying 4% interest to the US, and 1-2% of options to hedge my currency risk. So, US banker made 4%, Sales trader made 1-2%, and I was making 6% and life was good. Now Brexit happen, US still get 4%, the price of options goes way up to 4%, the investment only return 8%, and I am left holding my dick. Not great. I am not even getting into structured product holders who are also having a bad time because all their loans and shit start to default (2008 anyone?) 
Finally, last but not least, very few people are truly at the top isolated from the rest of the world. Most bankers/ finance guys (99.9% of them I would say) make a decent salary and bonus compared to Joe Average, but they are not making millions. They are  well paid employees, but employees nonetheless. And in the UK they are getting paid in gbp. A lot are from all over the world as this is quite an international industry. So if I take my personal example when I moved to London the GBPEUR was at 1.45 and life was good. Now it is at 1.09 and it sucks. It also sucks because job  could be transferred to this guys in Madrid/Paris/Frankfurt/Younameit. It also sucks because since the banks are being shafted on their profit I will not have a bonus this year. Also I probably have a house and other investment in the UK which are now depreciating. Etc etc etc. So no, investment bankers are not having a good time neither unless they are a high up predatory investor. Otherwise they are screwed like anyone else. And this is the beauty of Brexit, it is that is screws everybody! It is a shit idea no matter how you look at it. 

to;dr It sucks for almost everyone equally, bankers included.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/cm62e8/boris_johnson_takes_note_of_trumps_game_theory_to/ew324lc/,Henamus,1565061913

1227,"&gt;Is the consent freely given for this particular data that is being sent?

It would likely complicated maintenance tracking etc. but if necessary they could probably redact data. 

&gt;A possibility, but I disagree in this case. If the data can be defined, which apparently has been done, there is resistance somewhere.

My point is that decoupling it in ways that assure that nothing is leaked is difficult. Like lets say they wanted to do a secret mission. Well even if you scrub the sensor info and location information you might leave the g load data intact. And if you leave the g load information intact you could reconstruct the flight path. Hell the g load info might be largely pulled from the inertial navigation system. 

As I said erasing a particular set of data points probably isn't the issue. Making sure said data points are the only things you need to erase (without just wiping everything) likely where the trouble lies. Just for an example of this kind of thing there is a well known mathematical problem called the German tank problem. Its to estimate the likely maximum from a random sampling of a sequential list. The name is because of the exact reason you'd expect. Conventional intelligence estimated 1,400 tanks per month while serial number analysis suggested 246. The actual number was 245. 

&gt;What I meant was that the sending of this data is indicative of spyware because after 10+ years and billions spent, it is almost impossible that there is no ""filter"" for this on a plane that was known be exported from the get go and would therefore require this level of ""privacy"".

They joined the F-35 program and bought the jets after years and years of agreements. 

&gt;It's not ""of course"". It's a problem and it should have never been like that. The idea that the f-35 doesnt allow for incredibly specific configuration to control what is sent is absurd. The result is no different than spying.

My point is that in general decoupling information gathered from other info is not as clear cut as you might think. Would you rather the US release software that seems to remove the information but in reality left information or left gaps which may not provide all the information but provide enough information to be a problem by their absence? 

Its not as simple to make as you think.

Again I point to the Norwegian-Italian Reprogramming F-35 Lab.

1380,"&gt;Arbitration are not even fair tribunals, it's private entities with no transparency, no possibility to appeal, no ethical requirements for arbitrators (≃judges) even allowed to openly be in conflict of interest (often the case)

Judges are often choosen by both parties, also:

[http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/press/index.cfm?id=1468](http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/press/index.cfm?id=1468)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; and stats show they favor corps in almost 2/3 of cases.

Well, usually corporations don't sue countries when they know they can't win.

Also, could you source that?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;It's also an unfair system since only corps can sue countries/earn damages interest, it doesn't work the other way around, a country can't sue a corp, nor win any money (if it looses: it looses lots of money. If it wins: it only looses variating legal costs, a country can't actually win). 

A country suing a corporation through an arbitral tribunal wouldn't make any sense since a country is sovereign. Why would they do that since they do have their own tribunals?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Fines (and legal costs) are also astronomically higher because paid by our tax money so no limit problem! It's crazy that we allow such system to exist, allowing corps to contest democratically voted laws in the public interest because bad for their profit (corps' profit is above public health) 

Corporations don't contest democratically voted law, they ask for reparation since the rules of the game changed.

You have the exact same thing in french public contracts:

A public entity can change the rules of a contract but must compensate the private party (a corporation or a citizen) otherwise they are sued at the ""Tribunal Administratif"".

It's even considered [a human right](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sûreté)

That said, Gibraltar didn't need to act, the UK didn't need to support it and we could all have ignored the situation, but given the scrutiny it would have been arguably more of a problem not to act. Obviously it has all been politicised at this point, the extensions on holding the ship, whether political or not look like they are. But then the risk to UK shipping also seems rather real at the moment, and yet the UK hasn't shifted its position on the Iran nuclear deal.

What is the language system like in the Netherlands? Are students in early grade school learning English, French and Dutch?

I've always been curious how the various European countries handle it. Here in the US, if I remember right, you could take a second language course in addition to the usual English courses in Junior High (usually ages 11-14) but most don't (at least from my experience in Missouri) until getting to high school where the requirement is added for 2 semesters of a foreign language course.

My biggest regret was not taking my foreign language class seriously in high school, since I've realized later in life (30's) that it's actually really fun to learn a foreign language.

ahh... no...the UK wide backstop (i.e. remaining in single market) requires FOM, it requires all four pillars, it requires cash donations etc.

&gt; or not honouring the Good Friday Agreement

Untrue.

Here is the actual text:

&gt; 2. The British Government will make progress towards the objective of as early a return as possible to normal security arrangements in Northern Ireland, consistent with the level of threat and with a published overall strategy, dealing with:
(i) the reduction of the numbers and role of the Armed Forces deployed in Northern Ireland to levels compatible with a normal peaceful society;
(ii) *the removal of security installations;*

That's it....nothing about not having a border, that's all been made up.

&gt; At one point, the EU was scared that the UK would not want to leave the backstop so it negotiated a bunch of language to make sure one side couldn't keep the other side forever inside it (including an arbitration mechanism).

1589,"The fact that you say ""Ukrainians can understand Russians for the most part"" shows that you don't know what you are talking about. Almost everyone in Ukraine understands Russian, and they tend to overestimate how similar Russian is just because they know it from childhood. I know both languages and I'd advise you to avoid relying on YouTube comments.

In my experience, when it goes the other way, Russians can correctly understand about 20-30% of the Ukrainian sentences they hear. I have no idea why they would tell you otherwise, it's demonstrably so. Maybe they mean ""yeah, we understand Ukrainians alright when Ukrainians are speaking Russian"".

To really see the how similar the languages are, you can ask a Ukrainian to listen to the Belorussian language which is much closer to Ukrainian than Russian. He will strain to understand even 30% of what is being said. Or, if you want a fair comparison, ask a Ukrainian to listen to Bulgarian which is about as distant as Russian.

I get that, benefits the UK but what about goods entering the UK through NI that are now not being checked on that side? An open border like that is not ideal for the UK either

&gt;If Johnson is bluffing and also can get his own majority in a GE then I think he will fuck the DUP off and end up with the border in the Irish Sea.

If he can get a GE done it'll prob be a win for Tories and brexit party in any case if one single party doesn't come out on top so long as they are happy to work together they should easily have a majority. I'm not from the UK so I don't know how right or wrong that might be. but honestly I could totally see him dumping the DUP like you said, I wonder would we be in this state of they weren't propping up the tories

&gt;If he's not bluffing or still needs the DUP to make a majority then Ireland will have the choice from the EU of putting up a border on the island or having a border between Ireland and the EU.

Ireland will never accept a border between them and the EU. Not ever. EU wouldn't do it either as other small countries will see the Way fuck over a country for their own benefit and it will reduce confidence in the EU.

The main stats when compared are quite clear, nothing explains the difference, we can find comparable stats for every argument. There is just one that is different and that is correlation s with the amount of guns in the country.  


One good question to ask from a true gun nut would be to ask if we can remove one gun. The gun belongs to a confessed child molester who has made repeated threats towards the near by elementary school, we have his psychic evaluation that says ""don't give him a butterknife"". Can we take his gun away? Or is the problem going to get better by arming everyone around him and trained to be ready for action 24/7? Is the situation overall improved by taking one gun away or is it improved by adding one more? The whole idea is insane that there would never be a point where adding more guns doesn't make it better and that we should take one away. They have no end goal, adding more guns to the pile never stops. There are several obstacles in the ""more guns = better"" approach if we let them take the idea to the end. ""When does it stop?"" is a good question to ask..",,/r/europe/comments/cmeub7/america_get_your_head_out_of_your_ass/ew1w61r/,HeippodeiPeippo,1565032800

1677,"&gt; Election day was for everyone a round of force

Cristian Tudor Popescu: ""With a large turnout close to 80% whitch Romania never had before,the people taugh that by voting,by introducing the ballot in the box. In exchange large salaries,milk,bread,jobs,living standards,highways will come out of the ballot box""

&gt; Almost 17 million Romanians were on the lists and the vote was extended even till midnight. The voting results didn't surprise anyone.

 CNN: ""It's seems like in Romania the former communists won a large victory so now the acting President Ion Iliescu got 83% of the votes generating the rage of the opposition candidates""

&gt; In the end Ion Iliescu and FSN win the elections with a score whitch reminds us of long gone days. Almost 86% for the president and 66% for his party.The observers see frauds but insuficient in order to influence the result. Those who gathered in the square consider the FSN victory a betrayl of the revolution. Out of the country's division fraticide was born. In the middle of June the miners come to Bucharest to make order and to put an end to the Golaniad

* Miner #1: ""When a whole country is suffering,we,the miners from the Jiu Valley and the whole country,came here, in Bucharest,for freedom,for everything,for assuring human rights and for silance.""
* Miner #2: ""Get over here!""
* Miner #3: "" We found at PNȚ: drugs,weapons,ammo,automatic typewriter,printed money at PNL...""

&gt; The abuses and violences from 13-15 June were objectified in scenes of a shocking primitivism. From everyone getting beat up to urinating on opposition symphatisers,on books and in university halls. Students were assaulted and intelectuals mocked. The events were terrible. Unidentified,the casualties of the most violent and savage mineriad in Romania were burried in Străulești cemetary.
I the night of 13 June, Ion Iliescu holds a speech considered by many a major error.

Ion Iliescu: ""I thank you again,everyone for what you proved in this days. That you are a strong force with a high civic,working discipline. [You are] people I can rely on during good times and most importantly during bad times""

&gt; The June 1990 mineriad was the end of the story for the university square. A story that very few got to know in details but had effects following for a long time.


Cristian Tudor Popescu: ""Even today exist people who voted in this autumn one way or another determined by the events in 1990. People that always make references in their modern political option at University Square,at the mineriad, at everything that happened then.""

&gt; Just like it looked,the first post-Decembrist government was the launch pad for many modern politicians


Petre Roman:"" Mr Eugen Tișmănescu, Mr Adrian Severin,Adrian Năstase,Mr Victor Stănculescu,Mr Theodor Stolojan,Mr Victor Baliu""

&gt; As Prime-Minister,Petre Roman tried to impose the first measures necessary for a free market economy. In the country however,the great companies were lacking orders and their CEOs had little ways in handy for finding outlet markets.

""We need from the state,from the government,protection. As in not everykind of machine can be brought from Hungary to give an example,or another simple machine that the Romanian country can make.""

&gt; Many of these companies will soon go banckrupt or pe sold piece by piece to the so called ""foreign investors"". The only element of unity in Romania in 1990 was football. After 20 years where we didn't make a performance in the great world competitions,in the summer of the first post-Decembrist year we played in the world cup. Qualified in November 1989,the tricolor National team got people out in the streats with other type of meetings,meetings of joy.

Announcer: ""Very good,Lăcătuș! Gooooooal!""

&gt; We needed however at least an equal score with the descendants of the communist regime. On 21 September,Nicu Ceaușescu,the dictators's youngest son was sentanced to 20 years in prison. In the end he had only 5 and died of a liver disease in Austria. One year after Ceaușescu's removal,the Bucharest government lets King Michael and his family to come back to the country on Christmas holidays. The scenario of the first visit is repeating,however. The royal retinue was going to Curtea de Argeș when the Romanian authorities realize suddenly the missing Romania visa from the passport. The royal family is once again turned back around and forced to board a Romanian plane who's destination was Switzerland. The first post-revolutionary year ends in stutters and gaffes. Instead 1991 begins with a sign of future normalization. On 1 February,Romania becomes a special guest in the Council of Europe. The enthusiasm of the political class doesn't have echo everywhere. At the country side the people hungrily were asking for land. A property only theirs.

* Farmer: ""I would like a stable for the cows,a stall for the pigs and a stall for the birds,plus a beautiful yard with a beautiful facade""

&gt; The apparition of the land fund law in February 1991 intended to create equitable restituitions. But it created a long string of injustices and trials whitch continued over the years to suffocate the Romanian justice system. For land and for the right of property there were crimes between parents,siblings and friends. The abuses of local factors and lawful inperfections also brought their share.


""Man,what a treasure is here!""

&gt; The ghosts of the past continue to haunt us. At the begining of february trough a day order a comission is created in order to investigate a case whitch became famous,the Berevoiești documents. A team of journalists has dicovered a year ago 80 bags with files belonging to the former securitate. The archive was burnt and thrown into a dump in the comune from Argeș. The documents were relevating shocking facts that the political police continued its activity even after the revolution.

"" Look,this one is with the informers!""

&gt; The 100 Romanian and foreign  journalists managed to save a part of the files that weren't burnt yet. But the case was never solved. Later the former SRI chief would declare that the  Berevoiești scandal discredited for a long time the Romanian Intelligence Service and because of it were thousands of agents fired from it. Even the Bucharest government wasn't doing so well. The first cracks appear in the Illiescu-Roman team. And 2 ministers resign. In the country,the stores begun to fill but the Romanians were poorer than before and couldn't aford much. Instead they still had the mood and time necessary for protests

Protesters: ""Iliescu-Roman,asassin couple!""

&gt; Memorable,remain the manifestations from when François Mitterrand,the first western president visited the country after the revolution. Iliescu's opposition,just as many as in 1990 don't hesitate to introduce the leader of the French state in their dispute with the Bucharest government.
Alongside Mitterrand in Romania also came strategic investors from France in a first attempt to reestablish the commercial exchanges interrupted by communism. While in our country was apparently peace and quiet it appears that in Moscow it appears that new pages from war and peace were about to be written. The Soviet Union was living it's last days,Gorbachev the artisan of the Revolutions in the east was preparing to leave barely escaping with his life froma putsch of the last communist nostalgics. On the horizon a new leader with a strong hand was appearing,Boris Yeltsin. Taking advantage of the situation,Moldova asserts it's independence. Romania is among the first countries that recognise it in what many analists have called ""a great political error in the detriment of forcing the union"". The silence would not las long. The Jiu Valley miners who have learned by heart the road to Bucharest come again to the capital with a bag of claims,clubs,axes and an already famous leader,Miron Cozma. The bands storm the government HQ,enter the parliament and devastate everything in their way.

Miron Cozma: ""So,i'm asking again:Is there no one in the Romanian government coming out,from the whole Romanian government,there's no one to talk to us?""

&gt; ""The miners are the state,the miners have the power!"" is what they were saying. And for a few hours the democracy in Romania was in a clinical death.

* Miners:""Thieves!,Thieves!""
* Fat Miner:""We won't leave Bucharest unless the government changes"".
* Miron Cozma: ""Certify the replacement,the resignation of the Prime Minister Petre Roman and the whole government!""


&gt; The Roman cabiner is sacrificed. Theodor Stolojan's technocrats come to power who's priorities were the continuation of reforms and to prepare the 1992 elections. The most desired peace and the often invoked consensus started begun to take shape. On 8 December Romania was choosing trough referendum,it's new constitution.

&gt; 1990 begun with tears. The revolution gave us freedom but we still had to solve things left unfinished. To mourn those who gave their lives at Bucharest and Timișoara. On 12 of January,Romania had a national mourning day. Then 23 million Romanians started learning democracy on the go with an unseen before in the country enthusiasm after long decades of dictatorship and terror. We didn't have clear knowladge about democracy yet. Only a vague image about how it's supposed to be. For a moment the first word associated with freedom was ""abundence"",a large wave of international symphaty hit Romania. In the early 1990 long convoys of humanitarian aid with clothes,blankets,food and everything we lacked were sent by westerners towards the country. The phenomenon was main news on the news channels and was on the first page of the free newspapers. There was so much hunger for true,uncensored informations in the first days of 1990 that the number of publications exploded over night. It seemed like the whole Romania took a well deserved holiday. Everyone was reading. The long lines in front of newspoaper kioshks became occasions to debate,recall,and forgery of future plans. The future was however decided in the offices of the former communist structures where newer or older people were trying to take over the reins of power. Also in January the exiled intellectuals started to show up and alongside them the historical parties banned by the communists. The peasant's party lead now by Corneliu Coposu and Ion Rațiu and Radu Câmpeanu's liberals.


* Reporter: ""Where were you? Your Grandson smokes Kent,I smoke Carpați. Right! That's the difference!""
* Corneliu Coposu: ""When I was in the communist prison for 20 years,where were you?""

&gt; For the heated spirits at the time, the multi-party system and different opinions were hard to swallow. On 23 of January when the National Salvation Front broke it's original promise and dcided to participate at the first free elections,large protests appear. The country is split into to parties.

* Protesters: ""We are not payed! We are not payed!""
* Ion Iliescu: ""We don't need to let ourselves disturbed and provoked!""

&gt; The political parties ask FSN to resign,accusing Ion Iliescu and his close ones of being too close to the old regime in order to rule a communist free Romania. The FSN symphatisers organise a counter manifestation where for the first time ""Deat to the intellectuals"" is shouted.

* FSN symphatysers: ""Death! Death!""

&gt; Looking at the escalated athmosfere at the time,Silviu Brucan was saying that we need 20 more years in order to understand democracy


* FSN symphatyser: ""These parties,need to be disciplined,to listen to who is in power now!

&gt; On 29th of January the miners come for the first time to defend what they taught was democracy. Whitch means the assessment of a single voice.The one associated with the revolution,FSN. The masses of miners took their revenge on the opposition by destroying the Headquarters of the political parties. Their leaders were saved with armored vehicles from the fury of the mob. After this events the Provisional Concil of National Unity led by Ion Iliescu and made up out of representatives of the political parties + FSN. The role of the CPUN is to lead the country until the 20 of May elections. In spite of this reconciliation attempt,tensions in the country remain high.

* Cristian Tudor Popescu: "" In 1989 in December the genral sentiment was that ""they"" the activists,the aparatus,the nomenklatura,the communists are gone and it's only us,the people left. That will fell really great with each other in a brotherhood,in a bright society. And I realised then that in order to remain only ""we"" could have been worse than with the nomenklatura.""

&gt; The leader of the historical parties are accused of having it easy in the west,that they didn't eat soy salami like all Romanians and that they want to sell the country to the foreigners. On the other side,Ion Iliescu is accused of wanting to return to communism and that he hijacked the revolution. Romania's situation is followed with concern by westerners who clearly disappointed claim in the news at the time that Romania's evolution is more different than in onther former Communist countries.

""They stole our revolution. We want freedom. Not half of it but full freedom""

&gt; Iliescu rejects the accusations whenever he has the occasion

* Ion Iliescu: ""Who's revolution can someone hujack? The Revolution was made by the people,it belongs to the people. A power vaccum was formed someone needed to take responsability. I took this responsability in front of the people""

&gt; In the first months of the year 1990,the Romanians were about to discover that despite the bloody revolution the ghost of communism was hard to cast off. The people felt the need to destroy everything that reminded them of the former regime. It was like a necesary condition in order to go on our way.

""We are categorically against the communist domination technique by embroilment of social classes and categories!""

&gt; People of Timișoara go further and on 11 March they adopt the proclamation of Timișoara. Whitch proposes as it's 8th point the ban trough electoral law of the former activists and securitate officers from running for functions in the parliament and of course presidency. At a press conference organised at the time,Ion Iliescu is categorically

Ion Iliescu:""For the current electoral law such discussion have no point. They are without a point and they cant make a negotiations or dialog point or Intermediary dialog""

&gt; As the 20th of May elections are aproaching the split in the society is more and more visible and on 15th of March a new break appears. The Hungarians celebrate in Târgu Mureș the Hungarian Revolution of 1848. Rise the Hungarian flag on public institutions and take down 2 statues,Nicolae Bălcescu's and Avram Iancu's. The Romanians respond with meetings and protest manifestations whitch degenerated into violent clashes. On 19-20th of March the thirst for blood and revenge was producing again dead and injured.
The victims started to be counted. Mihăilă Cofariu,brutally beat up and left without memory. On the other side the Hungarian writer,Sütő András is mutilated by the Romanian protesters.

&gt; Despite the earned freedom,the people start leaving the country in large numbers. The news in the west are full of reportages about the tens of thousands Romanians that assault Germany. The Germans seem to not understand a thing.

* Reporter: "" How long do you wanna stay here?""
* Woman: ""I don't know. My husband will tell me.""
* Reporter: ""Why did you left Romania?""
* Woman: ""That's what my husband wanted""

&gt; According to the polls done in Germany at least 100.000 Romanians reached the former East Germany. Those who remained join the campaign for the first free elections. 3 candidates,3 different models are fighting for the heavy inheritance left by Ceaușescu. Ion Iliescu the worker, Ion Rațiu the bourgeois,Radu Câmpeanu the gentleman. For Iliescu's opposition the FSN leader means the continuation of the communist horrors.

Protesters: ""Down with Communism! Down with Communism! I'd rather be a tramp than a traitor! i'd rather be a hooligan than a dictator! I'd rather be a punk than an activist! I'd rather be dead than communist!""

&gt; On 23th of April those who were unpleased begin to gather in  the University Square in Bucharest where a never seen before event was about to take place,the Golaniad. The dialogue between opposition and government was the symbol of the divide whitch was threatening Romania.

Ion Iliescu: ""There are some people who are crying for a few punks whitch create chaos in the city center""

&gt; The idea of reinstating the monarchy grows fast and Iliescu's opposition see in King Michael a solution for Romania. The former monarch is trying to return to the country on Easter but is turned back from the Otopeni airport despite having a visa. The New power believes that King Michael could destabilise the country. The rejection of welcoming the former sovereign radicalizes the 2 parties whitch Romania was split into. In the University Square the protesters are multiplying.

&gt; In the country.The FSN symphatisers imaginates a whole series of slogans in order to shout their symphaty and trust.

* ""Iliescu don't forget,Arad is on your side!""
* "" ...Giurgiu is on your side!""
* "" And from here on,Iliescu president!""
* "" Iliescu may you live,[and] be our president!""

&gt; Ion Iliescu is welcomed everywhere as a saviour but the real secret weapon of the FSN is Petre Roman who's aparition ignites heated reactions. Enjoying a huge support in the country,FSN is accused by the right wing opposition that it manipulates the whole electoral machine and that it uses it's influence in order to stop the leaders of the other party from making their message heard. This was also one of the reasons the 1990 elections were supervised by foreign observers. For a first electoral exercise Romanians had a very hard task,voting ballots had 32 pages over 80 parties registered in the race for the 500 seats in the parliament. The day of 20 May 1990,the day of the first free vote was on the same date as Blind man's sunday. ""Ironically"" were remarking back then Ion Iliescu's opposition for whitch the stubborness of others of voting former communist activists remained un-understandable",Wallachia,/r/europe/comments/cmcfez/romania_in_the_90s_and_the_2000s/ew1m28u/,SSD-BalkanWarrior,1565026357

1833,"&gt; Usually when people argue about different systems, they usually make excuses with ""well the reason why it didn't work is because they didn't do it right"" (aka why is there no million inhabitant attractive city with pure free market real estate and low rents? Well obviously they weren't liberal enough yet! yes, the problems got worse with every step they took towards becoming more market liberal, but if they would be just even more liberal market then it would magically start working!) when they can't point to anybody doing it right. 

The problem with this argument is your lack of historical information. Those cities grew and became major hubs under vastly free systems. There is a momentum therefore if you impose authoritarianism it will still grow but will slow down and stagnate (depending on the scale of the authoritarianism, of course). This is why those attractive cities are starting to stagnate now, see LA, Chicago, NYC, and quite a few others. The problem with psydo-communistic legislation where the market hasn't been abolished (basically Keynesianism) is that the problems pile up as the private enterprises try hard to survive and barely manage it until it all collapses all at once. This is caused by the debt build-up that comes with market economies that have centrally planned aspects to them (again, in basic terms: Keynesianism) and the choking regulations that make companies barely able to survive. At that point, the economy is so fragile that all it takes is some breakdown in the supply chain and the whole economy is fucked. And because every higher-order economy has a few high difficulty and cost sectors, and those sectors tend to have a lower number of larger companies, it takes only one or two companies to die to their debt for the crisis to truly kick in. Suddenly the companies that were being supplied by those companies cant do their work properly and that causes a chain effect down the supply chain.

Eventually, it will recover as the sectors are filled with new blood (or not if the companies are bailed out, but that's a different discussion) but every time this happens the statists blame the market because it just did its natural thing but couldn't handle the manipulation of its one weakness: The currency. BTW this weakness is also implemented by the government because it doesn't let there be a wide variety of currency to protect from exactly this, and instead, there is one monopolistic currency creating a huge weak spot in the economy that the government exploits.",Armenia (Hayk),/r/europe/comments/cm6h0w/housing_crisis_could_london_learn_from_europe_bbc/ew198y6/,Maakolo,1565018210

1845,"&gt; If a Swedish company wants to start a branch in the UK they will need people from Sweden who know how to run the business.

That's what work visas are for. It's not hard to get those for a couple of managers. Note that US companies that have branches here, have no trouble getting this done.

""Free movement of labour"" is in practice used to destroy Western Europe's hard-fought labour rights by flooding it with Poles and Bulgarians who'll work for &amp;euro;1~2 an hour, in 12-hour shifts with no breaks.

This is also why it's very easy to hire Bulgarians under Bulgarian labour laws. (Contract them out via a Bulgarian agency.) A lot of the misery that free movement of labour has caused, simply wouldn't have occurred if the rule had been to always apply the labour laws of the place where the work is done. But that would've defeated the whole point. 

&gt; How are businesses supposed to expand into different countries if they aren't allowed to move people to those countries?

It's a good thing if that's hard, because big multinationals are bad for people.

Consider e.g. McDonalds. (Again, an US company, to show that you don't even need free movement.) They contribute very little to the local economy. Money barely comes out of McDonalds back into the community. They don't even buy ingredients, they have their own supply chains. They hire a couple of minimum wage workers and that's basically it, all the rest is profit that gets funneled back to the US. They don't even really pay taxes (not that tax money is ever spent well, but still). 

A local burger shop would also hire a couple of minimum wage workers, but it'd also buy ingredients from local sellers, keeping those businesses afloat. Even the profit that ends up with the owner stays in the community, because he also lives in the community and is going to spend most of his money there, buying from other local businesses. And he won't nearly be big enough to get to dodge his taxes or otherwise interfere with the government. If you buy a burger there, the money will stay in the community, and if you also work in the community, the money will make its way back to you eventually. 

McDonalds on the other hand doesn't need anything from the communities that it has snack bars in. Money spent there is funneled out, and so with every burger bought at a McDonalds, its surroundings become poorer. Making this easier is bad for everyone except the McDonalds shareholders. 

More or less the same is true for other multinationals. 

This is also why I don't get that all the left-wingers are suddenly cheering the EU on. It was made by and for multinationals.

From the [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-europe/trump-to-announce-eu-beef-trade-deal-friday-economic-adviser-kudlow-idUSKCN1US1A3?utm_source=reddit.com) article on the same subject..

*""The European Commission has stressed that any beef deal will not increase overall beef imports and that all the beef coming in would be hormone-free, in line with EU food safety rules. The deal needs European Parliament approval.*""

vs

*""“The agreement that we sign today will lower trade barriers in Europe and expand access for American farmers and ranchers,” Trump said.*""

And then there is the actual situation:

*""In 2009, the EU and the U.S. concluded a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), revised in 2014, which provides a solution to a longstanding dispute in the World Trade Organization (WTO) regarding the use of certain growth-promoting hormones in beef production. Under the agreement, a 45,000 tonnes quota of non-hormone treated beef was open by the EU to qualifying suppliers, which included the United States. *""

*""The agreement signed today is fully in line with WTO rules and establishes that that 35,000 tonnes of this quota will now be allocated to the U.S., phased over a 7 years period, with the remaining amount left available for all other exporters.*""

So the commission is technically right to say that it won't increase overall beef imports, but will presumably shift imports to the US (given they are getting a larger slice of the available quota) and it remains hormone free, while the US is also technically right to say that the agreement lowers trade barriers and expands access to US producers.

But if you read the two statements independently, they wouldn't quite give you that impression.

The UK would have to enter a customs union with the EU to have no border with Ireland. That just isn't going to happen. If that was their goal it'd be better to just stay cancel Brexit and deal with the political fallout.

French has conjugation of its verbs... so many tenses with rules only to have just about every frequently used verb be an exception to all rules.

2100,"&gt; Just a vote change, for sure not. An attitude change and a vote change would help their region for sure. 

Yeah, by voting for a Romanian party that will ignore their wishes. That would surely help them. Other poor Romanian regions didn't get better just because they have voted a certain way, so I struggle to believe that them voting a different way would.

&gt; Look up the numbers, the youth are starting to move away from UDMR and start voting for USR. We even had a couple of ethnic Hungarians from around Satu Mare and Oradea on [r/romania](https://www.reddit.com/r/romania/)

Trust me, the wishes of the Hungarian community are not respected by UDMR. Otherwise, the region wouldn't be so poor. They'd try to improve the living standards there, especially since that is the place where they get their votes from. The only thing they do is make inflammatory claims and ally themselves with other corrupted shitheads though. 

&gt;Wow, if a couple ""ethnic Hungarians"" said it on r/Romania, then it will surely happen anytime now. We got the same people on r/Hungary who said they will never vote for a Romanian party. It's almost as if these anecdotes are meaningless.

Sad to see you are so reticent to an improvement. I am not talking here just about a few reddit anecdotes, I have several Hungarian friends, from different parts of Romania and none of them like UDMR. Those reddit anecdotes just come to confirm what I really hope would happen. Anyway, as I said, only time will tell who was right. 

&gt;Meanwhile in Szatmárnémeti RMDSZ have won, even thought the Hungarians are not even a majority there.

How they won is also funny :) PSD made some behind closed doors deal with UDMR seems like because otherwise, considering the huge turnout for those elections, UDMR wouldn't have made it to the 5% they need. Data shows young Hungarians started to shift from UDMR to USR, so they were basically losing voters. However, they had a record number of votes. Look at the data and you will see huge numbers of votes from areas of southern Romania where barely 100 Hungarians live at best. Compare it with the previous elections and you will see even a 200% increase in the number of votes for UDMR. It's clearly a hoax, made to help UDMR. Their base voters are starting to leave to other parties, so unless they finally reform themselves, they will lose even more votes by the time of the next elections. 

&gt;RMDSZ will then ally with somebody else, they are allies through convenience not because of ideology.

UDMR will most likely stop reaching the 5% margin they need to be in the government if they don't start doing something for the Hungarian community.

Never knew we were opponents and at this point, I can see you hate pretty much anything that doesn't follow your exact ideas. As for being ""more intellectual""...don't know about that, especially coming from the guy so smart to blame an entire nation for what their government does. 

&gt;I have never claimed they don't have those rights ffs... You are making it up!

In your previous comment you said they don't have the same right as you do to that land...There's no legal distinction I suppose and hope between ethnicities in Estonia, so yeah, they do have the same right as you do. Your historical drama is totally irrelevant today, the Soviet Union is gone, get over it. 

&gt;These are very old Hungarian communities - don't you even dare to compare these situations!

So, my more intellectual opponent is suggesting the same argument: it's a matter of time.

2278,"Frequently many people seem to be very enthusiastic about the idea of running a trade surplus with a country and unhappy about running a trade deficit with it.

A few points that I'd like to highlight:

* **In the long run, trade is in equilibrium.**  If you import something now, you will export something later.  If you export something now, you will import something later.  You cannot force a trade surplus with the rest of the world in the long term.

* **Trade imbalances between any two countries may persist in the long run because those two countries do not exist in isolation**.  Country A may run a surplus to Country B, export more than it imports, if Country B also does so to Country C and Country C to Country A.

* **The ""goal"" of trade is not to run a surplus with the rest of the world**, but to leverage [comparative advantage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_advantage), to obtain things as efficiently as possible.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/cm70yi/russiaeu_trade_in_goods_83_billion_deficit/ew0i5i0/,vokegaf,1564990094

They are the descendants of the ancient peoples that settled in Crimea as well as the numerous ethnic groups that passed by the area such as the Scynthians, Greeks, Goths, Circassians, Khazars, Slavs, Turkic tribes, etc. They have a wide variety of phenotypes, ranging from typical Slav looking to Eurasian to indistinguishable from people from the Central Asian countries. They speak a Turkic language and their diaspora ranges from the rest of Ukraine to nearby countries like Russia and Bulgaria to as far as Israel (two distinct but related subgroups of Crimean Tatars that are known as Karaite and Krymchak Jews converted during the Middle Ages) and North America. Crimean Tatars are a minority in their homeland unfortunately thanks to recent events, but hopefully one day they can thrive again.

I was told by my dad that one of his maternal grandfather was a Crimean Tatar who converted from Islam and left for the Habsburg Empire (idk why there of all the places) because of ""the war"" (then again this could be any way from the Crimean War to one of the Russo-Turkish Wars). Unfortunately, nothing has been passed on from that ancestor except my dad and I learned how to make cheburek(http://ogo.ua/images/articles/1/big/1463487578.jpg), which is probably the most unhealthiest pastry I've ever eaten but then again, so is most East European food. Going back to the phenotype, that ancestor may have given my dad, his mom, his siblings, and my brother this very interesting ""exotic-looking"" appearance and some of them could pass for Uzbek or Latin American.

You say China already went back on it, well perhaps but probably only the political independence part. The chinese army is already there, so if you want HK to be truly free from china you have to get them to leave. Now china doesn’t want this so they have to be forced.

Kicking them out through a war would achieve nothing as the UK won’t be able to project that kind of power at that distance for long enough to force a peace (requiring an amphibious landing on a easily defensible are already protected).

So we must convince them to leaves. You mention sanctions well, it’s going to have to be one hell of a tariff hike (or whatever sanction) to outweigh the potential gain of a financial and logistics hub with 7M wealthy taxpayers. Tariffs that size will have costs borne by the british consumer as well. And could hamper the development of the country (huawei’s deployment of 5G around the UK could be stopped for example - there are alternatives but they’re significantly more expensive).

The fact is that China has a lot of leverage, and this is something hugely important for their future plans. IMHO the only way HK won’t be chinese come 2040 is if the upside is hugely diminished.

2413,"Damn. People even speculate about nationalists in this thread. So messy view on the country haha.

Several (IIRC) years ago the gov has introduced a project of a law which would exclude abortion from the list of *free* medical operations (i.e. payed by taxpayers' money). And it has caused huge public discussions which ended up in the law wasn't accepted. The legality of the process wasn't even discussed except some religious zealots. 

My personal position is it should remain free. Yeah, I don't like it's me who has to pay for some unknown woman's abortion instead of herself but on the other hand - if she can't afford such operation by herself, how would she afford providing her child even with basic needs? 

What might be relevant is ""in all or most cases"" in the question. Should an abortion on the 9th month of pregnancy be completely legal? What about the 8th month then? Or 7th? It should be a controversial question and I don't understand the countries in which it's not. But it's just my speculation about the poll question. Without seeing how was it really formulated in Russian I can only guess.

-----
For the high abortion rates, it's just poor family planning combined with mentioned absence of any cost. Somehow people get married too early here (""yaaaay we're adults now, we can do adult stuff such as marriage and having kids yaaaay""), which results in insane amount of divorces and might affect the number of abortions too (this one is my guess tho).",,/r/europe/comments/clxow9/europeans_attitude_towards_abortion_by_country/ew04hq3/,Some_siberian_guy,1564975529

Police should be trained to deal with mental people and angry people/ people with a temper and so on. Trained in de-escalation tactics, a bit of psychology and what do I know. Imo police need 2-3 years of training before hitting the road and constant sensibilitation (is that even a word? Sorry not my first language). They should also have psychologists or free /mandated sessions.

I can imagine that the job is mentally very taxing and it can happen to become insensitive to other people/humans in general. 

This happened to me in my job already and I have to remind myself from time to time that I am dealing with fellow humans and that I should imagine how it would be to be in his shoes.

That said when I was a kid I respected police and thought they were the good guys. Until I actually contacted them for help as a teenager. Now, getting older I am very skeptical and at times even afraid.

It’s certainly free to lose America, the core issue is that the EU, from its ideological inception, was always supposed to be both a way to deter American influence in Europe as well as Russian.

But then he goes and acts like this while still being married before god - lust is a sin, you know, and he's really going for it.

Maybe things are really different in Italian Catholicism, but when I went to (Lutheran) church on Sundays, during every sermon the pastor would recite something like the following:

&gt;Let us confess our sins...

&gt;Most merciful God, we confess that we have sinned against you in thought, word, and deed, by what we have done, and by what we have left undone. We have not loved you with our whole heart; we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves. We are truly sorry and we humbly repent. For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ, have mercy on us and forgive us; that we may delight in your will, and walk in your ways, to the glory of your Name. Amen. 

So I've just never really understood the point of this criticism.  Christians don't (or at least ought not to) claim that they are without sin by virtue of being Christians, that they always completely live up to everything asked of them by God, or that they are 'better' people than other sinners.

He did no longer have to fear the suspicion of the masters. He was on the side of good. The beatings the men received hardened his consciousness to embody good. One cannot receive beatings and be right, one cannot be dirty, eat garbage and be right.

2559,"&gt;And how would you think they could've helped Poland? One does not just ship a few divisions to Poland. Dday took a year to organize for instance.

It wasn't about sending troops to Poland.

Read some history.

The Polish defense plan was to stall the German advance till the English and French attack Germany from the West. Germany would have 2 fronts open, so they'd have to take some troops off their Polish front, and Poland might be able to push back. 

Except France and England launched [the Phoney War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoney_War), instead of really attacking Germany. 

So Poland couldn't fight the entire German army. And they were completely fucked when Russia attacked them by surprise from behind. 

Before that, Poland was doing a pretty damn good job slowing down the Germans.

2575,"I think that can hardly be the case.

The reason the media on the right is a shitshow of lies and conspiracies and whatever other bullshit you might want to throw in, is because the media in general is controlled by corporations, and corporations love profit, which naturally pushes them to the right of the political spectrum. 

The goal of any company/corporation is to make a profit, and to do so they love lower taxes and as small of a social security net as possible, and none would be preferable to them. Less taxes, smaller salaries, no protections for workers == large LARGE HUGE profit$$$$$$$$. 

So by their nature the media leans right, making them predisposed to try to tilt the balance to the right, and because unscrupulous people tend to get into management positions, they'll be more likely to use tricks and lies and cheat in order to get what they want: the public to vote against its own good, the sheep to vote to put the wolves in charge.

Lets use Kleinwasser anyway to explain what klein can modify and what not:

Klein can't modify the first two nouns, it can only directly modify the head it's structurally connected to - the first noun (compounds have a defining *head* and restricting *modifiers which in itself can be compounds with head and modifier*). 

Kleinwasserfontäneninspektor: a fountain inspector specialized in small-water fountains

2667,"&gt;In other words, the purchasing power of your $38,000 is lower than just  the exchange rate because you need to account for the fact that prices  are also 7% higher  in Ireland i.e the real value of your dollar is  lower in Ireland.

That's exactly what my point is. If we're going to compare the actual purchasing power of the median income person in the US to the actual purchasing power of the median income person in Ireland then the that reduces Ireland's PPP median income. 

&amp;#x200B;

Look at it like this: The 2016 OECD median income in the US is $34,000. If a pair of shoes costs $100 in the US, then that means the typical US worker has disposable income to buy 340 pairs of shoes.

&amp;#x200B;

The same OECD data which you quoted for shows that the median income in Ireland was €25,178 in 2016. But the price of these same shoes (or any average good) in Ireland is €107, so the actual purchasing power in Ireland is only (25,178/)107 = 235 pairs of shoes. 

&amp;#x200B;

Which would indicate on actual purchasing power ability that median incomes are 340/235 = 44% higher in the US than Ireland. 

&amp;#x200B;

You are taking the nominal median Irish income in euros and then increasing it to account for the fact that the market exchange rate is slightly higher for the euro than the dollar, then you are increasing it again to account for the fact that Irish prices levels are lower than US price levels, but they're not, the opposite is true.",,/r/europe/comments/cllbhn/european_countries_by_average_monthly_net_wage_in/evzmhzd/,Sandyhands,1564961485

Your $38,000 will only be worth $35,340 (-7%) in Ireland because prices are 7% higher. Then converting that $35,340 into euros, you will get €32,127. In other words, the purchasing power of your $38,000 is lower than just the exchange rate because you need to account for the fact that prices are also 7% higher i.e the real value of your dollar is lower in Ireland.

The symbolism can go quite far: obvious symbols are “Christ on top of the world” and the fact that Jesus was crucified on a mountain or hill. The cross in Christianity also symbolizes victory over sin and death, so a cross on a mountain can also symbolize a victory (over nature, a victory of endurance and will). Finally a cross like this could symbolize labor or the weight we all carry (ie the things we aren’t proud of, the times we were hurt, our diseases, etc.), since Christ carried his cross onto the mountain so do we. 

Some people get salty about religious symbolism like this, but I think symbolism is symbolism irregardless whether or not you believe the stories of Christianity to be historical or fantastical. The symbolism can therefore also be applied and be relevant to atheists and Muslims. Just like that symbols in secular art is applicable to Catholics (and all other people).

Watch how quickly that falls apart when you realise people don't change overnight and nepotism takes over.

&gt;Why is a communist “regime” a bad thing?

To answer this question, a million things. Communism is first and foremost an ideology built upon a hate and racism. It's endemic. You see it in how the Russian regime treated ethnic minorities:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decossackization

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dekulakization

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NKVD_Order_No._00485

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NKVD_Order_No._00439

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latvian_Operation_of_the_NKVD

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportations_of_the_Ingrian_Finns

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportation_of_the_Kalmyks

You cannot be a communist and ***not*** support ethnic cleansing:

""*Among all the large and small nations of Austria, only three standard-bearers of progress took an active part in history, and still retain their vitality — the Germans, the Poles and the Magyars. Hence they are now revolutionary.* ***All the other large and small nationalities and peoples are destined to perish before long in the revolutionary world storm. For that reason they are now counter-revolutionary.***

*But at the first victorious uprising of the French proletariat, which Louis Napoleon is striving with all his might to conjure up, the Austrian Germans and Magyars will be set free and* ***wreak a bloody revenge on the Slav barbarians.*** *The general war which will then break out will smash this Slav Sonderbund and* ***wipe out all these petty hidebound nations, down to their very names.*** ***The next world war will result in the disappearance from the face of the earth not only of reactionary classes and dynasties, but also of entire reactionary peoples. And that, too, is a progress.***"" Engels, ""the Magyar Struggle"" [Kampf Der Magyarische] 13.01.1849

Communists are also not afraid to resort to murder in order, often senseless and motivated purely by hate and racism:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katyn_massacre

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khmer_Rouge_Killing_Fields

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%90%E1%BA%AFk_S%C6%A1n_massacre

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viet_Cong_and_PAVN_strategy,_organization_and_structure#VC/NVA_use_of_terror

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qey_Shibir

The Soviets even committed terrorism upon people in the countries they invaded. [Here's a little set of declassified photos from the Winter War, where the Soviets invaded Finland. Communist partisans would routinely go into Finnish villages and brutally massacre anyone they found.](https://web.archive.org/web/20110519182722/https://englishrussia.com/2011/01/24/secret-photos-from-a-finnish-defence-forces-safe/) You can read Vaiettu Sota to see the extent of communist cruelty.

Then there's also the communist state itself that set up arbitrary laws to oppress the so called 'proletariat', brutal penal systems, kangaroo courts to execute any opposition, corruption, etc...

Just look at the current situation, [general price levels in Ireland for goods and services are 7% higher than in the US as of May 2019.](https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=CPL#) Meanwhile, the euro-dollar exchange rate is €1 = $1.11. Thus, the euro is valued 11% than the dollar while prices are only 7% higher meaning that €1 earned in Ireland has a purchasing power that is around 4% higher.

The 2018 PPP exchange rate for Ireland [was €1.25= $1](https://data.oecd.org/conversion/purchasing-power-parities-ppp.htm#indicator-chart). The actual exchange rate was [€1 = $1.18](https://data.oecd.org/conversion/exchange-rates.htm#indicator-chart). This is consistent with what I said above, the purchasing power in Ireland is about 4% higher.

As for celebrating the day, 5 August is a Croatian public holiday and they are indeed celebrating Operation Storm for its role to bring the Croatian War to an end.

3024,"&gt; Romania participated in that defeat in the first place. That was the main point of negotiations before Romania joined the war, to force central powers divert more troops on eastern front and give a better chance to France on western front, leading to central powers being defeated on that front. The gamble payed off. Of course, we'll never know for sure, but it is possible that without Romania joining the war, Central powers would have one on that western front. 

Yet Romania was beaten and that didn't help the Western front at all. As the hostalities ceased there by 1917. 

&gt; Not really. Lets not forget Hungary attacked after that, apparently Béla Kun missed the memo that Hungary lost. Attacked Romania, attacked Czechoslovakia. sure doesn't sound like a disarmed nations. 

With militias, not as a proper organised army. It was more of an organised militia from locals. We were attacked on both fronts, not the opposite. If I claim that Bucharest is Hungarian and you disagree does that mean that you attacked me?

&gt; We decided that during the war. we still had territories under occupation. I mean, what did you guys even expect. That as Central Powers, even though you lost the war, you can end up with more territory than before? Romania was part of the winning alliance, Romania made sacrifices so that alliance wins, its only logical that she receives the territories she entered the war for in the first place. Thats how wars go. 

No, we didn't expect that the Romanians would be so dishonourable that they would try to press an attack after an agreements that we will demobolize. Of course knowing what we know now it was foolish for Germany and AH to assume that the allies would act honourably and the formalities will be upheld as it happened in previous wars. Which led to the discontent and revanchism that led to another war 20 years after. 

&gt;Romania was part of the winning alliance

Romania wasn't part the winning alliance as it quit from the war in 1917. At least formally. Either way first you were told by the French to push until up to the Maros, then to Nagyvárad, then to the Tisza and everytime we let you just pushed further until you reached Budapest and ransacked it.

Now, in regards to the sanctions issue. In this sense the sanctions were breached twice which allowed for the seizing of the ship. The first time the sanction was broken was when Iran planned to deliver set restricted cargo to a refinery under Syrian Control that was under EU sanction, the second breaking of the sanction was when they ported in Gibralta. By porting in Gibralta they came under EU law and due to the intended destination for their delivery, were breaking the sanction and thus EU law. Due to this the ship was seized

&gt; You just kept attacking a country without an army.

You guys had 80k army we had same numbers. 

How is a country without an army invade czechoslovakia and wins?!

Truth is noone was attacking you on the field because they were all busy with the negotiations and your commie genius decided he did not want to die and since he gathered said 80k army by promising getting the lost territory back he send it on the offensive taking advantage of the fact that the opposing armies were being held back by the peace talks leaders.

Romania was the only one that decided not to put up with your bullshit after getting fed up of your wet noodle offensives.

&gt; Yeah you can, Romanians were actually quite loyal to the monarchy, as they have always voted for the unionist party. During the war they weren't deserting either so yes, absolutely.

So then how is it that the hungarians claim they did this and they did that when the vast majority of the people fighting in the armies and working the fields were not even hungarian?

Are Alsatians supposed to be hating their identity ? That's quite far from the truth, they're usually very fond of their province and their uniqueness. Unless you mean to say « being German » is supposed to be their identity, but I don't think their identity has ever been much tied into German nationhood.
But Alsace being very wealthy there's not much of a kneejerk reaction to the French state like there can be in Corsica.

And if that's the criteria, Corsicans « hate their identity » even more as they want *nothing* to do with Italy in any shape or form.

&gt;Also a part of southeastern france used to speak italian dialect(around marseille) but its also dead

The only Italian dialect (language, really) spoken around Marseille was Neapolitan back when they immigrated *en masse*. There were a lot of Neapolitan speakers in Marseille in the late 19th c./early 20th c. It left a few expressions (*fangoule* !).

I think you're referring to the Ligurian spoken in some Alpine valleys North of Nice as well as in the former territories of the principality of Monaco (Menton).

But French/[Provença](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbd1q4KJhY)l/Francoprovençal is just as dead in the Italian Alps (Val d'Aoste, Piemont).

I cound argue with a negative statement, you said something you should prove it. Because the Austrian-Hungarian Army did fight on that front and started the first offensive, while Hungarian partizans were actively fighting against the occupiers, which were again, Hungarians and Saxons.

&gt; You guys had 80k army we had same numbers. 

Again not true, even the wikipedia states that it was about 44.000 against 96.000 and most of that 44.000 were militias, not professional soldiers. 

&gt; How is a country without an army invade czechoslovakia and wins?! 

Because the Czehslovaks were an unorganized and poorly supplied militia too.

&gt; Truth is noone was attacking you on the field because they were all busy with the negotiations and your commie genius decided he did not want to die and since he gathered said 80k army by promising getting the lost territory back he send it on the offensive taking advantage of the fact that the opposing armies were being held back by the peace talks leaders. 

But it was you that attacked us after 3 different peace treaties. If you would have adhered to the peacetalks your army would have stopped at the Maros. Which it obviously didn't, because it knew we can't put up a fight without an army. 

&gt; Romania was the only one that decided not to put up with your bullshit after getting fed up of your wet noodle offensives.

That's right, there is a very busy customs office and it's not as simple as Correos makes it look like, I lived there for 7 years and I've had to deal with customs several times. In theory, purchases below 250 euros value should now be exempt from SAD fees - they were taxing all Amazon imports and people were quite pissed. It also usually took weeks for customs to process your package, and different shippers would slap their own managment fees on top of the SAD tax and IVA/IGIC difference. The catch is that while you are supposed to be able to do your own SAD without intermediaries, in practice it's not possible and there's no way to avoid the fees. The delivery services know it and they kept charging their own managment rates even after the 250 euro minimum value requitement for SAD fees. Often times a 25 € e-purchase would end up costing you 70/90 on delivery, effectively keeping e commerce from being used.

On the other hand, a truly duty free zone doesn't exist anymore on the islands, like it did in the 80s, so now there's all the hassle of having a customs office without any of the duty free benefits for locals living there.

So it’s completely thinkable to an American that you could wait in jail well, well over a month for them to sort things out. 

We also have the largest prison population by percentage in the world, and regularly throw people in jail because they choose to get high on a drug that’s on all levels less dangerous than alcohol, so I’d say it’s silly to try to compare this to the American law system as if the American system is some sort of beacon of progressiveness. Most countries treat their criminals like shit, and most treat foreign criminals (or in the US’s case, potential criminals who are asylum seeking) like double shit. 

If that’s Sweden’s process I don’t get why people are bitching and moaning about it. The dude committed a crime and now he faced the consequences of that crime. You could argue that what he did shouldn’t be considered a crime, but again we throw you in jail for two years before your hearing if you try to move here to find better work, and we also throw you in jail for possessing a leaf we don’t like.

In that case, Angela Merkel was also forced to step down after suffering two electoral blows first in Bavaria and then in Hesse within two weeks and after lots of higher-ups in her party pressured her to go. She announced to not run again as a chancellor on 29/10/18, here are some news articles that were published in the two weeks prior to that date:

&gt; Angela Merkel galt lange als die unangefochtene Kanzlerin und CDU-Chefin. Aber das hat sich geändert. Ihre Macht bröckelt. Auch deswegen schaut die CDU nervös auf die Hessen-Wahl.

https://www.tagesschau.de/ausland/merkel-zukunft-101.html

&gt;Wachsender Unmut / CDU-Politiker spekulieren über Merkels Zukunft / Steht nach 13 Jahren ein jähes Ende der Ära Merkel bevor? In der CDU distanzieren sich mehrere Stimmen von der Kanzlerin - und verknüpfen ihr Schicksal mit der Hessen-Wahl in sieben Tagen.

https://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/angela-merkel-cdu-politiker-knuepfen-ihr-schicksal-an-die-hessen-wahl-a-1234329.html

&gt; Die Hauptstadt zittert vor Hessen. Denn das Ergebnis der Landtagswahl am kommenden Sonntag wird Auswirkungen auf die Bundespolitik haben. Schon jetzt wird über die Zukunft von Kanzlerin Angela Merkel (CDU) und SPD-Chefin Andrea Nahles spekuliert. 

https://www.wz.de/politik/inland/das-grosse-zittern-in-berlin-vor-der-landtagswahl-in-hessen_aid-34051599

&gt; Hessen hat gewählt und erneut hat die CDU schwere Verluste erlitten. Auch wenn sie an der Katastrophe vorbeigeschrammt ist und Volker Bouffier Regierungschef bleiben kann, wird die innerparteiliche Debatte um die Zukunft Angela Merkels an Schärfe gewinnen. Wieder hat die CDU gewaltig verloren, es fehlen rund zehn Prozent. Merkel sollte nicht wieder als Parteivorsitzende antreten, raunen immer mehr in Berlin.

https://www.morgenpost.de/politik/article215671197/Nach-Hessen-Wahl-Was-waere-wenn-Merkel-gehen-muss.html

Wer spielt den Königinnenmörder?

https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/plus182411528/Hessen-Landtagswahl-am-28-Oktober-koennte-Merkel-ihre-Aemter-kosten.html

Wer sagt es ihr? / Der letzte Tag, an dem Angela Merkel noch selbst über ihre Zukunft entscheiden kann, ist der Montag nach der Hessen-Wahl.

https://www.zeit.de/2018/43/angela-merkel-bundeskanzlerin-cdu-parteivorsitz-abgabe

&gt;Nach den Landtagswahlen in Bayern und Hessen mit herben Verlusten für die Union kündigte Merkel an, dass sie nicht mehr für den Parteivorsitz kandidieren wird. Sie will bei der nächsten Bundestagswahl auch nicht mehr als Bundeskanzlerin antreten.

https://www.zdf.de/nachrichten/heute/merkels-politische-karriere-in-bildern-100.html

&gt; Damit zieht Merkel die Konsequenz aus dem Debakel bei der Landtagswahl in Hessen. Was die CDU betrifft, ist Angela Merkel für Teile der Gesellschaft, die bei weitem nicht nur im AfD-Milieu zu finden sind, sondern bis tief hinein ins christlich-bürgerliche, zu einer persona non grata geworden, mit der kein Staat und erst recht keine Erneuerung mehr zu machen sei. Merkel war auch in der CDU jahrelang unangefochten, weil sie als Garantin für Anerkennung und Wahlsiege galt – als Symbol des politischen Erfolgs. Jetzt ist sie für viele zu einem Symbol des Misserfolgs und schleichenden Machtverlusts geworden.

Then you can shoot. Any shot unless you are at exactly the same orbit would be taken from extreme global scale range since those fuckers move so fast that if the range isn’t extreme when they fire it will become extreme before the bullets hit. It’s not exactly easy to hit something far away with a machine gun. Even for a computer. To shoot down fast things here on the surface we use extremely fast guns that pretty much fill the air with a cloud of metal. Carrying that to space is hardly practical and impossible to reload. Plus using a weapon like that would be a diplomatic nightmare as it would fill the orbit with more debris that would risk take down random satellites from other nations.

3361,"More ""they"" than ""she"". The ""formal you"" in German is identical to ""they"" in all declensions as well as conjugation.

 There used to be a whole set of different addresses you could use to avoid plain ""du"" (thou): ""Ihr"" (2nd person plural: you) to make it sound like the other person is extra important and therefore more than one person. This is what many other languages like English and French do as well, in English it even replaced the informal pronoun thou completely. Then there was ""Er/Sie"" (3rd person singular: he/she) to avoid directly addressing someone and keeping a distance. So instead of talking to somebody, you would talk as if you were talking about them. The modern formal ""Sie"" (3rd person plural: they) is simply a combination of both. You show respect by using a plural, but also distance by talking in 3rd person.

All those other addresses were also capitalized to make it clear that it's just a formalism, not real 3rd person and/or plural. If you ever get into reading some story set in medieval/preindustrial times or an equivalent fantasy setting (e.g. Lord of the Rings, but even Star Wars for some reason), you will notice that they use ""Ihr"" instead of ""Sie"".",Germany,/r/europe/comments/cll6tc/aap_rocky_leaked_us_letter_calls_for_release_or/evxvqez/,muehsam,1564910242

The literacy rate at beginning of the dictatorship was of 38.2%. By 1970, close to its end, it was of almost 75%. This was achieved by a much higher investment in education compared to the previous, supposedly democratic, regime and by the introduction of mandatory public schooling for all children aged 6 to 12. 

The regime also expanded higher education. The Catholic University was legitimized in this period, and several public universities were established, such as the University of Aveiro, the University of Minho and the New University of Lisbon.

Regarding the Portuguese economy, some people further up the thread were blaming Estado Novo for Portugal's current economic situation. This too could not be further from the truth. In fact, Portugal saw its period of greatest economic growth during Estado Novo. The thing is that when the regime was first instated Portugal was an extremely poor country, due to a myriad of tea but mainly due to terrible management during the 19th and early 20th century, so not even the decades of growth during Estado Novo were not enough for convergence with Europe.",,/r/europe/comments/cllbhn/european_countries_by_average_monthly_net_wage_in/evxvth6/,bacalhau23,1564910368

&lt; “24/7 solitary confinement, restriction of amenities for the most basic of human functions, access to palatable and life sustaining food as well as unsanitary conditions.”

Solitary confinement is no joke, and it’s problematic, but it’s in no way like in the US. You get to go outside for an hour a day, you get to meet with your lawyer and you can communicate with the staff. You’re not locked in a hole being ignored for a month. There is absolutely no unsanitary conditions, the cells are very clean. They serve two hot meals a day and while I’m sure it’s not luxurious in anyway it most definitely is life sustaining. 

Now, the reason he had to stay in jail was because he was a flight risk. I believe bail is denied US prisoners all the time for the same reasons?

3425,"There is a major cultural change which I think people overlook.


1. History 

When the Great Depression hit the US in the 1930s we suffered from hyper deflation. The money supply actually contracted and prices went down. US policy has always been afraid of another deflationary spiral.

The Weimar Republic of the 1920s has the opposite problem with hyper inflation. This created a different cultural outlook towards investing.

2. Bankruptcy law

Loans in the US are almost all non-recourse. You borrow money to buy a house,  but you’re aren’t personably liable if you don’t pay. Instead they just seize your house or asset as collateral. People are less afraid of taking of debt and owing money since it’s not a personal obligation. 

3. Stock market length 

The German stock market probably collapsed cometary twice in the last 100 years. I have no idea what happened after the occupation, but I assume at least everyone in east Germany lost everything. The New York stock exchange is 230 years old so has a much better track record and I think that makes it appear more stable.

4. Perspective 


I got into a huge argument in my tax policy class in law school. This Israeli girl and I both were adamant that we should completely get rid of the corporate Income tax because why should poor shareholders pay the same income rate as rich ones? It’s not progressive because a rich shareholder has to bear the same burden of a poor who just owns one share. All taxes should be levied at the individual level.  Instead certain countries just don’t buy into the idea that they can be part owners in a corporate stricture, they think you’re gambling when you’re really buying a serious business",,/r/europe/comments/clmfq8/germans_are_the_top_savers_in_the_world/evxqmid/,Sandyhands,1564902989

3449,"&gt; 1650 Brutto, resulted in 1.1 every month

I just calculated it with https://www.brutto-netto-rechner.info/. Right now, assuming tax class 1, no church, rest ""default"":

* 1650 EUR gross
* - 109.59 EUR taxes
* - 153.45 EUR retirement
* - 20.63 EUR unemployment
* -127.88 EUR health insurance
* -29.29 EUR long-term care insurance
* =&gt; 1209.17 EUR net

So your effective tax rate is 109.59/1650 = **6.6%**. However, I understand that it feels more like (1650-1209.17)/1650 = **26.7%**, because you cannot choose not to pay any of the others (and maybe we should include 17.50 EUR GEZ/""Rundfunktbeitrag"" as well).",,/r/europe/comments/clg6vl/european_union_vat_rates_2014/evxqtfu/,themoosemind,1564903246

Nope, they are all going to Wacken willingly. Here's an article about that (with an additonal different picture):  
https://www.kn-online.de/Nachrichten/Schleswig-Holstein/Wacken-Open-Air-2019-Fuer-die-Senioren-aus-dem-Altenheim-ein-Pflichttermin

Translated by deepl:
&gt; When a retirement home plans a trip, there are many possible destinations. The Wacken Open Air is rather not one of them. The fact that 13 pensioners are still going to Wacken has a lot to do with dedicated carers - and with a heart's desire.
&gt; 
&gt;Ilse Schaefer calls ""Wackeeen"" and the twelve passengers of the bus make the ""Pommesgabel"" - the metal greeting with outstretched index finger and small finger. Basically nothing unusual at the Wacken-Festival - if Mrs. Schaefer were not 92 years old and was sitting in the bus of a retirement home.
&gt;
&gt; For the sixth time the ""Haus am Park"" in Heide takes some of its residents on a trip to the heavy metal festival Wacken Open Air, which takes place for the 30th time this year. This year there are 13 seniors, three of them are ""repeat offenders"" and have already been there in the past years. The oldest retired rocker in the bus is 95 years old.
&gt; 
&gt; Generation Heavy-Metal is now coming to the home
&gt; 
&gt; The atmosphere in the bus is good, the anticipation of the Wacken Open Air can be literally grasped. Once they were even served beer on the bus, the seniors say. Even if that doesn't happen this time - according to Kroos, the home didn't get a transit permit - everyone is looking forward to the trip.
&gt;
&gt; It all started with Rüdiger Pahl, explains Susann Kroos, the house's housekeeping manager. The 59-year-old now suffers from multiple sclerosis, likes to listen to ACDC and has always wanted to go to Wacken. Kroos was only too happy to fulfil his wish and made him a birthday surprise with his trip six years ago. Since then, the pensioner has put four Wacken shirts in his closet and infected the others with his enthusiasm. ""We are now getting the Heavy Metal generation into the home,"" explains Kroos, himself in the Wacken shirt.
&gt; 
&gt; Ilse Schaefer is in her third year. On her first visit, she was initially sceptical about the music. But shortly after she arrived in Wacken, she showed the french fries fork - that's how the metal greeting is called - to everyone who came to meet her. When a young Metalhead didn't want to greet back immediately, she shouted: ""Don't be so stubborn now"". The former head of the travel agency and the whole bus giggled.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; It's also about breaking down prejudices, says Kroos, who has taken time off for the next few days to go to the festival herself. So the inhabitants can see that the Metalheads are actually quite peaceful. At the same time it is one of the highlights of the year for the pensioners. ""In the two buses together 800 years are gathered and they will still talk enthusiastically about the trip the whole year.
&gt;
&gt; The anticipation in the bus can be literally grasped. Once they were even given beer in the car, the seniors say. Even if that doesn't happen this time - according to Kroos, the home didn't get a permit to drive through - everyone is looking forward to the trip.
&gt; 
&gt; Many of the pensioners are familiar with the Wacken Festival, they come from the area, have children and grandchildren who work or celebrate there. So it's not so important whether you like Heavy Metal or not. He can't do much with music, says Gustav Jacobs, 89 years old and for the first time in Wacken. But that doesn't matter: ""There has to be something for everyone in the world"".",Hesse (Germany),/r/europe/comments/clobm6/german_senior_citizens_on_their_way_to_visiting/evxlv23/,ArtilleryAlwaysHelps,1564897162

Europe is very different though.

If we think that political goodwill is kind of like money in that you can trade them into services, USA has been collecting a huge pile through the 20th century.  Now first  Bush2 and then  Trump have been burning through the pile like it has an expiration date coming.  Without it, USA has to resort more and more on soft force, which means that it's allies start to take their distance and cut dependencies by building alternative infrastructure, which in turn means USA having to resort to hard force, if they want to push forward. This is the same what Russia does... in time turning USA from leader of the free world to its pariah.

3704,"&gt;If I bought a state-of-the-art fighter for $100 million I would not want it to send back gigabytes of information to the USA once a month, either.

Why? What do you have to hide from a close military ally and what about the benefits it brings in maintainability, logistics, readiness, etc?

&gt;Perhaps more importantly, I would want the option to stop all incoming transmissions from the USA.

Then you're not going to be able to keep up-to-date cryptography keys to communicate with US and other allied nation's jets through secure radio links.

&gt;Something similar to the Suez crisis might happen again, and it is public knowledge how in that case the USA sabotaged the military operations of its allies, the UK and France.

That seems to be a pretty niche example and one that fighter jet maintenance logs would be fairly irrelevant to.

&gt;I would not want entire fighter squadrons to just receive a short transmission during their regular monthly ALIS update and shut down.

That seems a bit paranoid; just look at how much it took for the US to halt F-35 deliveries to Turkey, and how much the US administration is bending to try and accommodate Turkey (the bizarre idea that it'd somehow be okay for Turkey to still own S-400s and F-35s if they just ""keep the S-400s turned off"").",Australia,/r/europe/comments/cliz6h/norwegian_f35_spy_on_its_owner_send_sensitive/evx3vwq/,Dragon029,1564881144

3712,"I will just respond with this point. Not from me, but from Ben Yagoda, renowned professor of journalism and English: “Tu quoque is a subset of the so-called ad hominem argument: a strike against the character, not the position, of one’s opponent. Ad hominem gets a bad press, but it isn’t without merit, when used in good faith. It’s useful in an argument to show that the stance being taken against you is inconsistent or hypocritical. It doesn’t win the day, but it chips away at your opponent’s moral standing and raises doubt about the entirety of his or her position.” 
As for insulting him/her, I would argue with the following extreme analogy. Let us imagine a person who is hanging on a drug dealing chat room, who is often commenting in defense of drug dealing, who is politically pro-cartel, who is supporting people doubting scientist speaking against the dangers of opioids, and so on. Now, would calling that person a drug dealer be an insult or a reasonable assumption?

The factory turned grapes from the vinyards I've mentioned before into bubbly and is the reason why my family name is still on the bottles today. It earned my ancestors so much that they were amongst the first shareholders of both a famous German car as well as an insurance company.

3818,"Interestingly, The Haut Koenigsbourg (then German and named Hohkönigsburg) was pretty much the German equivalent to the Castle of Pierrefonds in France: 

Just like Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte had ordered an expensive and heavily idealized (later much criticized as ""un-authentic"") restauration of Pierrefonds by a renowned historical monument architect (Viollet-le-Duc) in 1857 so as to have an idealized, the Prussian/German Emperor Wilhelm II ordered the expensive and also heavily idealized restauration of the Hohkönigsburg (which was expensive too and lasted from 1901 to 1908) by historical monument architect Bodo Ebhardt. 

Both were to some extent criticized for that idealized rebuild more inspired by tales and dreams of medieval grandeur (today such an accusation would be formulated as ""pseudo-medieval Disneyland"") than focused on an authentic rebuild of the much simpler and less artistic military buildings those castles originally were.

But much as I can understand the concern for historical authenticity behind them, I don't quite agree with those criticisms. And nowadays, they aren't even a subject any more (at least not in the broad public, who enjoys these castles). I think that as long as it stays within tasteful limits, conforms with what existed at the historical period and doesn't disfigure the architecture, then such an idealized restauration is not a bad thing but even a good thing if that's what it takes to save a castle ruin from decay and bring it back to a glorious new life.

In a bit more constrained form this logic exists in other languages too, like German:

Du schreibst deinem Vater - You write to your father.

Deinem Vater schreibst du - It is your father that you are writing to.

Or in Spanish:

(Él) trabaja en una biblioteca - He works in a library.

En una biblioteca él trabaja - It's a library where he works in.

For example the command that killed Guido Rossa was not fooled or infiltrated by gladio but was made of integralists who really believe in the ideal.
The real point is why the sismi didn't stop the BR when they could.
For two or three times the police almost destroied the organization (already in the '76) but than info and support stopped and they re thrive , The violent line was an internal thing, sismi didn't drive their action into the blue.

&gt;There is a reson why they commit such attacks and blamed those on left-wing organisations if these organisations haven't commit attacks that would scare and alienate the general population. 

Yes, it's the strategy of tension, but false path that didn't have long life.

&gt;you're confusing being and armed organisation with committing attacks on things that weren't supposed to be targets, or that would obviously be counter-productive

The blame is on the BR strategists, the useless homicides were often motivated by political hate, not by bad advice from gladio infiltrates.

People aren't just mindless zombies. This country (like every other country) tends to run in cycles. I would say that today is quite similar to the very late 1890s. Today and back then, ultra laissez faire politics were the norm, the poor had no protection, environmental protection was completely ignored, unions were demonized, etc. But the people were not silent. Although there was not much action on the political front, the citizens of the country, from every state, were organizing. In the following years, we had the Progressive Era, which while it did not accomplish everything, completely turned around the direction the country was going.

History, too, runs in cycles. When there are good times, there are eventually bad times. But it goes both ways as well. The US (and many other countries) has been stagnating for such a long time (like during the Gilded Age). But where ever you have an eco system, there somehow is always a recovery which in the end makes the community stronger.

So in part of Trumps strangeness, it was highlighted that they would probably be released and free to return, largely because even local laws would struggle to convict many of them for anything that would see them held for any period of time. 

On top of that, the SDF is also sanctioned by the US to a worse extent than the syrian gov, as it has the same import restrictions and trade restrictions, with almost no external trade. 


So you have US backed groups holding people that likely won't get much if any jail time in prisons that are hard to maintain as they are suffering from sanctions imposed on the country by their main backer, making the ability to hold so many prisoners difficult and therefore likely lead to a more streamlined approach to clear the lesser cases / harder to prove cases.",,/r/europe/comments/cl2ck3/donald_trump_threatens_to_release_thousands_of/evvj37k/,elboydo,1564838596

It's a fact that Italy was in the middle of the years of lead and many red terrorist roamed the penisula, so when you search for the culprit is absolutely right to explain the methods of the two extremist fringes and what lead to the right path.

And the article rightly said that far left didn't use mass bombings.

How in the world is this whataboutism ?

&gt;Organisation was under manipulation of SISMI, and infiltrated by Gladio and CIA, which made the killing happen, as highly possibly the kidnapping as well. Same goes for other acts too.

Moretti and others were not nato gladio operators, killing spree of Battisti were not the conseguence of ''bad gladio apple''

You misurandestand how sismi fooled the red brigades, they were under strict controls and infiltrated but all of the acts were autonomous choices and decisions of Moretti and others.

The apparatus leave the left extremist to operate without crushing the organizations, but the far left was absolutely not commanded by outsiders.

\&gt; Some were genuine people who were manipulated into it, and some were infiltrators. 

The heads of organizations and many, many of the killers were absolutely not infiltrators.

\&gt; It was convenient to US, and blame is on the Gladio and the US  infiltrated into BR, and used the organisation as well as clearly  assisted it since they knew things they weren't supposed to know like  the routes and such.

### Embassy’s Press Officer reply to a question on the demise of the INF Treaty

**Question:** The US has formally withdrawn from a key nuclear treaty. How does Russia assess the situation around the INF?

**Press Secretary**: The US decided to pull out of the INF Treaty under a false pretext of Russia’s non-compliance with the agreement. Our country has done everything possible to save the Treaty, including by making unprecedented proposals of transparency. However, Washington continued its reckless and dangerous way to demolish the pact.  

It is worth stressing that Moscow, nevertheless, has a credible list of US violation of the Treaty, which has been repeatedly presented to our partners. It consists of the following:

\- Production, testing and illegitimate use of intermediate- and shorter-range “**target missiles**” beyond what was authorized by the Treaty. So called “target missiles” have characteristics identical to ground-launched intermediate- and shorter-range ballistic missiles and are used by the US in tests declared to be anti-missile defence testing, but in multiple cases without physical intercept. Covering instead the whole missile flight cycle, i.e. from the launch to the impact of the re-entering payload, thus representing tests of weapon-delivery vehicles, allowing for maintaining and developing technological, industrial and combat capabilities of intermediate-range and shorter-range missiles that were banned by the INF Treaty. Violation taking place since 1999, immediately raised by Russia at the Special Verification Commission (SVC).

\- Production, testing and use of **armed unmanned aerial vehicles** (UAVs) that completely match the Treaty definition of ground-launched cruise missiles (“*an unmanned, self-propelled vehicle that sustains flight through the use of aerodynamic lift over most of its flight path \[…\] that is a weapon-delivery vehicle*”). Armed UAVs have nearly the same combat potential as GLCMs and can accomplish tasks similar to those accomplished by ground-launched intermediate-range and shorter-range cruise missiles. Violation taking place since 2001, immediately raised by Russia at the SVC.

In 2003 US refused to further discuss “target missiles” and armed UAVs at SVC, thus suspending its activities which resumed only in 2016, but still without any US steps to assuage Russian concerns.

\- Production, testing and deployment in Romania (2015) and Poland (underway) of a **ground-based version of Mk-41 universal launchers** (as part of the Aegis Ashore sites), capable of launching Tomahawk intermediate-range cruise missiles. This runs contrary to the provisions of the Treaty and notably to the compromise understanding reached while negotiating the Treaty that the complete destruction of the land-based infrastructure for the cross-platform Tomahawk missiles would reliably prevent their deployment on land while preserving the sea-based variant. Violation taking place since 2014, immediately raised by Russia through diplomatic channels. Still no US’ steps to assuage Russian concern.",,/r/europe/comments/cl8if2/the_us_formerly_withdraws_from_the_intermediate/evv2yie/,RDwelve,1564816810

&gt;BIRMINGHAM, England (Reuters) - Britain will use import tariffs to protect its farming industry if it fails to reach a trade pact with the European Union, farming and environment minister Michael Gove said on Tuesday.

&gt;Gove said the government also had the power to intervent to provide direct cash support to the most vulnerable sectors.

[UK government announces 'disastrous' no-deal tariffs on beef, dairy and lamb entering mainland UK](https://www.independent.ie/business/farming/news/farming-news/uk-government-announces-disastrous-nodeal-tariffs-on-beef-dairy-and-lamb-entering-mainland-uk-37908522.html)

&gt;Cormac Healy, Senior Director of Meat Industry Ireland (MII) said in a Hard Brexit scenario, Irish beef exports to the UK would now face tariffs that will undermine the viability of trade and is also being presented with a very restrictive import quota regime. 

&gt;""This level of tariff would severely undermine trade.  On top of this, the UK Government has proposed zero tariff import quotas, that on the one hand fall massively short of existing beef import volumes entering the UK market and on the other hand open these quotas to all global suppliers. 


&gt;""Very quickly we can expect to see erosion of our position in the UK market in both volume and value terms, due to stiff competition from lower priced beef from other regions of the world” said Mr Healy.

I really don't think I have to point out that it's not the fact that the UK decided to leave, but the fact *how* the entire process has been developing into a clown fest that woefully demonstrated how utterly incapable the british government is. This uncertainty puts all EU companies that have any sort of commercial relationship with the UK in jeopardy.

Also I don't even understand what the fuck you're rambling about to begin with. The only thing that survey has demonstrated is that the relationship between Germany and France is being seen as healthy by the populus, while the UK is still deemed as more trustworthy than Russia. So what's your point even, or did you somehow made the conclusion that 37% is lower than 28%? Yeah, that makes me actually worry about your vote being worth as much as mine.


Last but not least I never said that I share the entire sentiment of that survey to begin with.

4750,"&gt; I am not interested in emotional or politically engaged dialogue, just want to know more about this event.

I find it hard to believe. 

""This event"" is just one among many, as extermination of upper strata of Polish society (or anything remotely anti-German) was practically official thing Third Reich was engaged in. It begun immediately with the invasion (ex. Bydgoszcz aka ""Bloody Sunday"" happened in Sep 3-4, 1939), and it was followed not just by similar incidents, but by multiple extensively documented (and witnessed) extermination *campaigns* (ex. Intelligenzaktion).

The very fact that discussion is about Katyn *alone* immediately makes it a ""politically engaged dialogue"", as the real topic of discussion is not some obscure atrocity that happened in WW2, but if Communism should be treated the same as Fascism. And the *unquestionably* correct answer (since wrongthink is punishable both officially and unofficially) is ""yes"".

&gt; I am asking about your literature where you have your informations from

There would be at least a hundred entries (most of them non-English; not all of it directly related to Katyn itself), and it would serve no purpose other than to satisfy idle curiosity.

Going by sone rough Quora answers, most people can do 1-1.5 grams every 3 days efficiently, meaning, none of that coke is wasted on dopamine your body just doesn’t have to release. So assuming Germans are efficient (though DB has proven the opposite to me...), that’s 1.25g * (365.25/3) = 152.1875g per person, per year. Population of Germany is 83,000,000 (roughly) so 1.2% of the population is 996,000 people. So population * amount = 151,578,750g for all of Germany, in a year.

4759,"No, I'm asking if the system gives one party a consistent advantage over the other.

&gt; It's been Labour vs Conservatives forever and each has ruled with 30-40% of the votes.

I'm aware of this. But it's not directly comparable to the US because there are multiple parties. In a two party system there would only be Labour and Conservatives, and all the other parties would be absorbed into them. This wider group of Conservatives would hold the majority of seats (with 49.6% of the vote apparently, in what seems like a fluke for them to be able to win more seats with fewer votes).

That's definitely a bad outcome - the side with the most votes should be the winner. I'm not saying there are no flaws in this system.

But I think the American system is worse. We have an unequal number of electors per citizen in various states - voters in lower population states count for much more than voters in high population states, and most of the low population states vote Republican. Our system encourages people not to bother voting - if you're a Republican in California or a Democrat in Texas, your vote will never count due to the stupid winner-take-all rule. The candidates only have to campaign in the 6-7 swing states that will decide the election for the rest of the country, and can ignore all of  the others. And the unequal distribution of electors per state is specifically designed to create situations where a Republican can win despite losing the popular vote.

Republicans are also massively favored in the Senate (each rural Republican state gets 2 senators, each highly populated Democrat state with 20 times as many people in it gets... just 2 senators), and slightly favored in the House.

Munich is historically the Bavarian capital though. the Kingdom of Bavaria (origin HRE).

Frankfurt being traditionally part of Hessen (origin HRE).

Bremen and Hamburg were city states already during the HRE... so the origin isn't strictly bound to a US military base, but also to history itself.

Köln was historically a principality itself, which included territories of its current Bundesland  Nordrhein-Westfalen. so it's pretty logical that it doesn't have its own Bundesland.

4951,"I'm not an expert on British politics but I do understand the basics. Since there are several different parties it's unusual for one party to hold a majority on their own, so two or more parties that share similar views work together to form a majority group.

The American system is designed to make it impossible for anyone outside of the two major parties to succeed. If not for this, we might have 2-3 significant right wing parties and 2-3 significant  left wing parties, similar to the situation in the UK. But here, (almost) everyone on the left wing has to be under the Democrat umbrella, and everyone on the right has to be part of the Republicans.

The Conservative Party and their allies do actually hold a majority in the government, and represent a narrow majority of the voting public.

This was not true for Trump. He and his party received millions fewer votes than the Democratic side received.

Frankish wasn't even a term until the gaulish revolt and break away during the start of the West Roman Empire (WRE). When they declared themselves the ""Empire of Frankia,"" which encompassed Spain, Britannia and huge swaths of North Africa until the revolt was put down. This might be a surprise to people but there is no French ethnicity, that's a fact. French people were widely known as ethnic Germans, widely known as a Germanic kingdom. There are plenty of reasons why they speak a different language, that's a non sequitur to refute the point, not even Germans all speak the same form of German, the vast majority speak utterly different dialects, they just have a commonly known ""high"" German. The reasons why Germany is so culturally different than France and Spain, is because Rome never conquered over the Rhine. Which was a massive part of the WRE collapsing and giving way to the MASSIVE power vacuum. Spain and France pulled the vast majority of their culture from previous life under the Romans. They built coastal villas, castles, forums, etc. They had an entire empire influence them and their way of life for over 500 years. Not to mention this was their first link to the middle East, vastly changing their understanding of the world and other cultures.

5290,"Hello Europeans, American here. Wow. I'm almost embarrassed to write that: American. The times have changed. America isn't someone different than before. We are the same people. Just many who call this wonderful nation home feel more empowered to speak up with a certain administration.  Personally, it devastates me to see this poll because it signifies that America has lost your trust. I hate that it has come to such partisan politics today, but I'd like to point out just a few things that may earn us some forgiveness and maybe spark some hope. 


Number 1: America is the world's only current superpower and the third largest country on earth in terms of population. It's super hard to get anything uniform because of how many people there are in this country. Many of us feel like we can't make a difference due to the political structure and pure number of people who have alternative views. I hate to point out differences, but the UK, France and even Germany have it much easier just down to numbers and size. 

Number 2: Trump. Sorry, he did get elected. But not by America as a whole. It's also important to remember that many that could not vote absolutely revile him. Many school-age kids hate this man and everything he stands for (whether it's ingrained or real is something else). But please try to understand that the majority of us here in America just are baffled by a lot of what he does and says. It won't last forever. His adversaries grow by the day and his supporters are beginning to realize he can't get anything done. The American people will not tolerate him for long. 

Number 3: Hope? America isn't going anywhere. We will still be the same country as we were 20 years ago. The people may have changed, they may not have. Unfortunately, Russia has also never changed. Putin knows EXACTLY what he's doing and he's banking on the fact that Europeans will see him as the lesser of two evils. The annexation of Crimea was about Sevastopol and not much else. Putin understands Russia is weak. He needs a warm water port to have a navy and for trade. Putin also fears a unified Europe and an engaged America. Just a few years ago, he threatened serious responses if Sweden or Finland joined NATO. Putin controls the power/heat for a lot of German homes and almost every Eastern European home. That's an awful big bargaining chip. He annexed Crimea because he was afraid of Russia's weaknesses. America sacrificed Crimea to gain a more West-friendly Ukrainian government. Unfortunately, chaos allows Putin's power to grow. Unfortunately again, America has given him that chaos and that division. So has Brexit. This is the exact setting he wants. Don't think that Putin is your friend. America shouldn't be your friend if it keeps on this track, but please give us the benefit of the doubt. We've been friends this long,let's not lose faith now....",,/r/europe/comments/ckzqtx/the_vast_majority_of_germans_89_consider_france/evtmzel/,captfaramir,1564773876

5410,"&gt; well considering Germany (in 2018) is the 4th largest GDP in the world (UK 5th, US1st) and quite the powerhouse in the EU (2nd) it might be in their interest to take their opinion into account, for the sake of world trade.

Yeah, the world trade that has fucked the US for decades... As we give our European “allies” access to the largest consumer market on earth, they reward our “friendship” with ever-increasing restrictions on American exports (beef, dairy, tech, etc). Just two weeks ago, France passed an unprecedented bill taxing US tech companies simply for existing (they should only be taxed in the country where their headquarters lies). But the French greed is just a more powerful force than friendship with America.

&gt; Then the first world war was all major parties experiencing strong ego (nationalism) and wasn't Germanies fault. 

The first world war occurred as a result of when Germany invaded Serbia because they refused to extradite the assassin of Franz Ferdinand. The Germans thought their own justice was more important than the national sovereignty of another state. And since that state happened to have international allies, it turned into a shitshow.   


&gt; The second one could be considered as such (Aryan race and all), but also considering the depression, treaty of Versailles and the general living conditions in Germany at the time wasn't really as much of an ego as it was a 'fuck you' to the rest of the world.

The second world war in the European theatre had more to do with Germany again using force to annex territory that didn’t belong to it.

&gt; Also, I'm not really aware of the international joint force in the strate of Hormuz. I know of the Uk sending ships because they (justifiedly...is that a word?) took an oil tanker from Iran, which is responding...

Iran has so far attacked six different tankers with limpet mines, boarded and illegally seized three (including two belonging to the UK), and they attacked oil fields in Iraq with missiles killing three people. They also shot down a US military asset operating in international airspace.

&gt; ...and of the USA sending ships because they're being on a not so good stance with Iran (which is a bit more complex, but seems to be solely the US' business considering the stance of the EU on the nuclear deal). IF you'd like to ellaborate on that, I'd appreciate it.

The US sent ships because Iran directly threatened US diplomatic staff at the US embassy in Iraq. They then attacked several internationally-flagged tankers, and destroyed a US military asset in an unjustified attack. They are lucky US President Trump has shown mercy and not pit them back i to the stone age yet.

Instead, the US has sought an international response to Iran’s aggression. They requested NATO allies send military vessels to patrol the Gulf of Oman to deter further aggression. Germany has since declined this request because they are apparently not a true ally of the US and would rather look out for their own interests rather than uphold order where innocent civilians are being targeted by Iran. The UK and France have agreed to deploy vessels as part of this joint international maritime force.

    1. The functioning of the Union shall be founded on representative democracy.
    
    2. Citizens are directly represented at Union level in the European Parliament.
    
    Member States are represented in the European Council by their Heads of State or Government and in the Council by their governments, themselves democratically accountable either to their national Parliaments, or to their citizens.
    
    3. Every citizen shall have the right to participate in the democratic life of the Union. Decisions shall be taken as openly and as closely as possible to the citizen.
    
    4. Political parties at European level contribute to forming European political awareness and to expressing the will of citizens of the Union. 

I think you got the wrong article. If you meant art. **50**, I think you got it the wrong way around: the European Union is not a sovereign country, but a supranational organisation. Its member states remain sovereign, and can thus withdraw by denouncing the EU treaties (just as the US just did from the INF treaty). Article 50, introduced with the Treaty of Lisbon in 2009, just provided a (sort of) orderly basis for doing so, but this was always possible, and will remain so as long as there is no full integration. Arguably, even full integration is no guarantee against subsequent secession: just look at Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia in the past, at the successive Quebec referenda in Canada, or at the eventual future of the United Kingdom or Spain.

5539,"Because all of the US ""buhhu why they no trust us"", this is a repost of my first reddit post ever.

&amp;#x200B;

 

I still rate the US higher then  Russia, but not by much. And that has only to do with history, if it was  just contemporary politics, then the USA would lose out big time.

Why?  Russia is an issue. A real issue and to be taken seriously. But a  manageable issue. Their economy is in shambles. Putin is internally  weakend. There most potent weapon these days is the internet. But in the  end, they just play the european game as it has been played for  centuries.

The US however is sick. And it is not just Trump, it started with Bush already:

* When Powell went to the UN and lied into the faces of the people there to start a war in Iraq.
* The  setup up of symbolic anti missile batteries in eastern Europe, which  really protected nothing but provoked the Russians. Completly  unnecessary
* The utter mess the US left in Iraq
* The  dismanteling of privacy rights in the US that led to a loss of privacy  and ever more state supervision all over the western world.
* Patriot  act, which did not effect Germany directly, but the US lost the nimbus  of being the protector of human rights and civil liberties within  western societies.
* Collateral damage. The attitude of the US that civilian lives dont matter.
* Guantanamo
* The  grandstanding of ""mission accomplished"" which looked utterly juvenile.  The whole rethoric about ""crusades"" in the middle east.
* A  US president that talked and acted like a child. And worse...he got  reelected. That was the point where a  lot of people here did not just  lose hope with the US political system, but the american people as well.
* The threats of american polititians to invade Den Hague should an american ever be put on trial there.
* The abduction of German citizens
* secret torture camps all over Europe. Torture. As a western country.
* etc.

Bush  was responsible for the US to lose it's reputation for upholding  freedom of democracy. These words have become a farce by now. It may  have started earlier, with Nixon, with Vietnam, with Iran and all the  South American coups. But for Germans, the the impression of the US to  this point was in it's majority colored by the cold war and the  assistance the US provided in rebuilding West Germany. Bush was a  turning point.

Obama did a lot to rebuilt the relations, but there as well:

* all wars continue
* Drone strikes
* The massive increase in surveillance and industrial espionage by american security services to benefit american companies
* The  ongoing messing in the middle east, sprialing down into ever more  chaos. Eventually leading to the migrant crisis which strained Europe  massivly and which still echoes today.

Yet  relations ""did"" get a lot better and a lot of people started to think  Bush was the exception and the americans themselves finally managed to  get back onto the right track. A united front against Russia was  established. Climate problems were finally approached.

Then came Trump. And all the Americans here whining about German attitudes here towards the US can stuff it.

* His behaviour towards Merkel. Utterly, utterly disrespectful on so many levels.
* Trump saying Germany (and the EU) being ""evil"" and that people should remember who started WW2 to Macron.
* Open support for Brexit and other movements to break up the EU
* Constant threats towards german companies
* An ambassador stating he wants to activly enable the far right in Germany. ""**enable**"". ""**the far right**"". in ""**Germany**"". Are you f\*cking kidding me?
* Attempts by american alt rights groups to influence German public opinion and politics.
* The dismanteling of american democracy by the republicans, becoming ever more authorian.
* Every international agreement gets kicked, without presenting viable alternatives.
* An  attitude of american politians (and a lot of american people, as shown  in this thread) to see european countries not as partners anymore, but  vassals to do their bidding.
* MAGA
* Nordstream  2 and the massive amounts of misinformation and propaganda coming with  it, compeltly disregarding decades old german politics to contain and  control Russia to a certain degree by making them dependent on German  investements and money. Kid yourself not, Russia is a lot more reliant  on German money then Germany is on russian gas. It's a policy that got  Germany and Europe great political dividends during the cold war.  Completly ignored by current generations.

Russia does a lot of the same shit. But Russia is **a)** a lot less powerful and **b)** not even remotely in a position to hurt Germany as is the US.

And  Trump, after Buish, proves that maybe this d\*ckhead will be gone  eventually...but it's only a question of time until the next idiot is  voted in. And nobody herewould be suprised anymore if Trump gets another  4 years.

Finally,  a whole generation by now has grown up who have zero memories of the  cold war and only saw the US doing one shitty thing after the other. No  country can live based on the merits of bygone generations and expect  others to measure them just by that.

And  finally, on a personal note...I used to be a massive US friend. I  travelled the country from Seattle to New York. I had an american girl  friend and lots of american friends (still have). But the country as a  whole? To me, it's lost. It's society has become utterly sick. It's a  paranoid, frightful society that revels in violence and made guns their  golden calf. And it elects buffons and gives them the power to  annihalete the world. Putin isa a d\*ck, but he is a predictable d\*ck.

Trump  is of all charts in regards to sanity. He is destabilizing his own  country, the West and the whole world in a  way Putin can only dream  about.

It also does not help we  have to thank american neoliberals for the economic woes in so many  countries and the out of control capitalism we have today.

My  hopes are still up, but it would not only be careless to trust the US  these days..it would be utterly stupid on every level. I pity Russia.  Though they did deseve their situation.

&gt;In most of their range, brown bears generally seems to prefer semi-open country, with a scattering of vegetation that can allow them a resting spot during the day. However, they have been recorded as inhabiting every variety of northern temperate forest known to occur.[88] North American brown bears, or grizzly bears, generally seem to prefer open or semi-open landscapes, with the species once having been common on the Great Plains and continues to occur in sizeable numbers in tundra and coastal estuaries and islands. Variable numbers still occur in prairie areas of the northern Rocky Mountains (mostly in Canada, but some in the contiguous United States). Where continuous and protected, such as the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, the prairie is near-ideal interior habitat for the species.

5660,"&gt; A movie star not flying a private jet won’t make any difference, a tax on everyone flying private jets might.

The point of a carbon tax isn’t paying money - the world won’t be saved by anybody paying money into some bank account. The way carbon tax works is that by making things more expensive, people buy less of these things because they can’t afford them as much as they used to, so they start looking for cheaper (climate-friendly) alternatives that cost them less - i.e. going by train instead flying; or in the case of movie stars, flying commercial airlines instead of private jets.

&gt; Where hypocrisy is relevant is if people talk about climate change and taking action, but then don’t actually support policies to combat change because they would personally be affected negatively by such policies.

These people talk about climate change, but they don’t act on it. They had an outstanding chance to lead by example, and they chose to ignore it. They are actually showing us very clearly that while they wish to be associated with fighting for climate change, they would rather not “personally be affected negatively by such policies”. I’m not expecting everyone to go everywhere by train or sailboat the way Greta Thunberg is, but how is it not hypocritical to attend a climate conference in the most carbon-expensive way possible?",,/r/europe/comments/ckmjf0/alisters_flock_to_google_summit_in_private_jets/evsfp0b/,LittleMsWhoops,1564744595

Russia, USA, India and China are -for the most part- *honest* about their intentions/policies. Doesn't mean I agree with them. 

For example the whole 'America first policy' - the USA has always looked out for itself (look at the last 70 years of history) but now at least they have a leader who is honest about that. 

Putin doesn't pretends to be an 'democratic' leader but one who puts stability first (and given the way Russia was in the 1990's I can understand this). Also looking at the way NATO was expanding (against the ''old arrangements '') I can understand why he would be weary of us. 

India (for the most part) seems to mind it's own business.

China doesn't pretend to have noble motives for their trade deals - they clearly state their intention to own (most of) the globe/increase their power.

The UK *says* it's a democracy but seems to do everything it can to subvert the will of their people.

That was not the first (attempted) referendum.

&gt;in May 1992 the Crimean parliament established a Crimean constitution, and in September-October 1993 it established the post of President of Crimea. But in early 1994, after a polarising election campaign, Crimeans elected as their President a strongly pro-Russian candidate, Yuriy Meshkov. A power struggle between the Ukrainian parliament and the Crimean parliament commenced. Another Crimean referendum in March 1994 asked three questions: ‘1.3 million voted, 78.4% of whom supported greater autonomy from Ukraine, 82.8% supported allowing dual Russian-Ukrainian citizenship, and 77.9% favored giving Crimean presidential decrees the force of law’. Yet after more political turbulence – with the Crimean parliament voting to oust Meshkov in September – in March 1995 the Ukrainian parliament unilaterally abolished the post of President of Crimea, and scrapped the Crimean constitution. The Crimean parliament was forced to define a new constitution, which the Ukrainian parliament finally ratified in 1998.",Montenegro,/r/europe/comments/ckzqtx/the_vast_majority_of_germans_89_consider_france/evsa297/,Glideer,1564737219

Oh absolutely. The publicized information makes everything worse for the US.

It used to be perceived as and called itself the leader / defender of the free world. That's a high position to be in and it's hard to live up to such a claim.

So the fall was that steeper once we noticed that the US really isn't.

Is it worse than Russia? I don't think so in general, but there are things that had direct negative consequences for Germany.

To be fair, most of this would have happened regardless of whom the American populace elected president, so its fair to say that the general population can be exculpated in this regard. This has simply been the US’ modus operandi since the beginning of the Cold War. I think it’s just the fact that the American people willingly voted to put Trump into power, no matter how much of a fool he is or how undiplomatic and brazen he is, that allows people from other countries to more clearly see the “substance” of Americans. Even somebody like Bush can put up the whole “innocent little Georgie” act and fool some idiots regarding his true intentions (if you’re pragmatic enough regarding the intelligence and gullibility of the average American voter, even electing someone like Bush can be excused).

Not even close to enough to take on Iran.

&gt; the Iraq-like weapons of mass destruction speech at the UN

The US has been against Iran’s intentions to procure a nuclear weapon for years. The US had similar opposition to North Korea, and guess what? There was no war. You’re being very selective with your evidence. You can’t only look at cases that fit your predetermined schema.

&gt; the strike that Trump called off at the last minute, 

You’re using as evidence that the US wants to invade Iran Trump calling *off* a small punitive air-strike? This makes no sense. Even if it had happened, punitive air strikes don’t mean war (see Syria, where Trump dropped some bombs on an Assad base but never went to war with him).

&gt; that someone like John Bolton (!) is in the administration

[Trump and Bolton are not buddies, and in fact they clash because Trump thinks Bolton is too hardball](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/white-house/trump-souring-on-john-bolton-meets-one-potential-replacement-and-eyes-another).

&gt; and the drumming of support the US has being in Pakistan

The US is in talks with the Taliban right now. Pakistan has a lot of leverage over them. That’s the main reason the US is trying to be on Islamabad’s good side. Not to try and get Pakistan to join some war with Iran that it will never, ever join, least of all under the current government.

&gt; Saudi Arabia ( bases there) and other ME countries

But the US can’t invade Iran from these bases for practical, logistical reasons as well as political reasons.

&gt; but that would be an argument in details.

It was the white group that turned it into the most powerful country over the course of a few centuries, not the non-whites. Only recently, a few decades ago, has the USA become very diverse due to mass immigration from the Latin countries and the white birthrate falling while the African American and Hispanic birthrates soared. 

Today the USA has all sorts of social problems thanks to its diverstiy. Anti-white racism is on the rise, with progressive whites taking an active roll to destroy their own people, thinking that by doing so makes them morally superior. They can't even make a simple TV show or movie without the production being scrutinized and criticised for how many white actors it has.

5996,"In the centre of the painting the viewer is drawn to the unmistakable figure of Venus, identified by the golden apple in her left hand from the Greek myth The Judgement of Paris. Entwined with her is the virile adolescent male figure with wings and quiver, Cupid – her son. The undeniable sexuality of their embrace (cupid fondling his mother's breast and kissing her parted lips) has long been the subject of scandal and debate. Rather than conveying the act of incest per se, Bronzino utilizes these two as symbols for the embodiment of male and female sexuality. Whatever the case, the erotic narrative of the painting becomes immediately clear.

The puzzle of the remaining characters inhabiting the edges of the scene is far more difficult to decipher. Much has been interpreted about them according to the classical perspective. However, an additional hypothesis is that they also accurately portray the clinical presentations of untreated syphilitic infection.

In the top of the painting, behind the aquamarine veil, is the interplay between two characters identifiable on the right as Father Time (symbolized by the hourglass) and on the left as Oblivion. Their actions have been debated extensively. One theory is that Oblivion, with her missing eyes and brain, and hence inability to remember, is attempting to throw a veil over the scene, so that it may be forgotten, bereft of lasting consequence. Father Time on the other hand is forcibly revealing the scandal, implying that the sexual encounter cannot simply be elapsed, and also revealing to the audience the characters of the foreground – each of which display signs of syphilitic infection. In addition to this established interpretation, with her missing eyes and brain Bronzino may also be portraying the neurological consequences of untreated syphilis; characterized by optic nerve involvement and dementia associated with general paresis of the insane.

Below Oblivion is the tortured figure of a man often interpreted to represent Jealousy. In 1986 this classical interpretation was refuted by Conway who provided compelling evidence that the character in fact displayed the clinical signs of secondary syphilis. The figure is held in painful flexion, the periarticular nodal swelling of his fingers evident, pulling at his hair with signs of patchy syphilitic alopecia. In addition, a fingernail is missing, consistent with syphilitic anchonia. His ocular sclera are reddened, and his toothless gums show signs of a sero-sanguinous discharge and perhaps a gumma present on his lower palate. Interestingly, his loss of teeth may be the result of the mercury poisoning, the established therapy for syphilis infection in Renaissance times.

In contrast to this tortured soul is the playful child to the right of the painting showering the besotted Venus and Cupid with rose petals. It is only on closer inspection that we see the symbolism in this character. His smiling face shows no sign of the trauma ensuing as a large rose thorn pierces through his right foot – engrossed in the passion, he is foolishly indifferent to the damage being caused in pursuit of that passion, interpreted by previous authors as representing Foolish Pleasure. However, is this lack of sensation also the result of syphilitic myelopathy and nerve damage – Tabes dorsalis?

The final character is perhaps the most obtuse and disturbing embodiment of all. The beautiful young girl dressed in green innocuously offers the lovers a honeycomb, symbolic of temptation. Yet on closer inspection she has the body of a monster, complete with a serpentine tail, hidden beneath her green dress. In her left hand she guards from view the sting in her tail, interpreted by many to represent Fraud or Deceit as she is both sweet temptation and evil consequence in one body.

Still the subject of continued intrigue and debate, Bronzino promotes his hidden public health message to the modern audience; as relevant today as it was nearly five centuries before.
