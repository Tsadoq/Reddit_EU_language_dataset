Because Russia still tries, NATO remains to an extent anti-Russian, but that aspect is not as central anymore, without the threat of an actual empire.

66,"&gt;Ok so I take it that EEG is basically the FIT, and it is paid by the consumer but as a separate item over the base price and other taxes.

correct.

&gt;So isn't it accurate to say that without any EEG, but with the same electricity source mix, the base price would get increased to the previous base + EEG level?

No, it's more complicated. The Price would get lower. But the People Building, but Windfarms and especially PV and other Solar Technology would be not less profitable or not profitable at all. Wind get lowest amount of EEG/FIT per KWH, while contributing the most. 

Right now Wind could be profitable without EEG and that Coal has a higher CO2 Prices, but the state still want incentive for more alternative Energy, so EEG/FIT is slowly decreased in Prices, the Problem is that the amount renewables rises, so Prices still rise slightly.

&gt; This is the only way revenues and profitability would be maintained in a system without the FIT.

See above. If coal get's even more expensive due CO2 contribution are cutting down subsidies are easily can compete with coal. Wind(in the right location) is very profitable as much changed. Solar got more profitable, but Germany has not much sun, for other countries I also profitable without FIT.

&gt;I mean, if you want to compare cost of electricity without taxes and other cross-country differences, you still have to include the EEG/FIT since it's a per-kWh flat contribution just like the base price.

71,"I already wrote this in another post but I think it's important to give some context to his speech. This is the first part of his speech with Jens Stoltenberg, Nato’s secretary-general (I just google translated it but I think the translation is ok). Hope people will stop making their opinion on one sentence out of context but I suppose this is how internet works.

 

&gt;The  first fundamental issue is how to ensure peace and stability in Europe.  This is the original, historical, vital meaning of the Atlantic  Alliance, created, I would remind you, in 1949 to tie the United States  to Western Europe and protect it from the Soviet threat. The world has  changed, the iron curtain has fallen. We celebrated a few days ago the  30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall. The Warsaw Pact has  disappeared. The Alliance, meanwhile, remained standing to be the  guarantor of our collective security. This implies today to return to  some essential topics in this area.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
First,  a lucid, robust and demanding dialogue with Russia. I assume I carried  the will to give a dynamic to this dialogue. I also assume to have done  it without ever being naive or complacent. Our Alliance has a history,  it also has a geography. And so, the relationship with Russia can not be  an unthinkable, because Russia is geographically part of Europe. I  deeply respect the concerns and security interests of all our European  partners and I make them entirely mine. I will defend them always in  priority. And I know what that means for their story. They know that.  This is the meaning, for example, of our concrete commitment to NATO's  deterrence and defense posture in the Baltic States and the Black Sea,  which has been constantly reaffirmed. We are and we will remain  intractable when our sovereignty or that of our partners is at stake.  But has the lack of dialogue with Russia made the European continent  safer? Is it in the interests of European stability not to tackle the  frozen conflicts directly or to let the situation in Ukraine get bogged  down? I do not believe that. It is in the interest of peace and  stability in Europe that in this respect, we will hold with the  Chancellor, on December 9, a Normandy summit here, to make concrete  progress in the implementation of the Minsk agreements. . And it is  because I believe in a stronger European sovereignty that I think that  we also need to build a new architecture of trust and security in Europe  through clarifying our relations with Russia, by setting our conditions  . For the same reasons, in the interests of peace and stability in  Europe, which I recall for me is the first objective, we must start the  discussion on arms control. We had a long exchange on this point. These  issues are covered by several multilateral treaties. They were also  historically covered by bilateral treaties between the United States of  America and Russia. We had the opportunity to express our regret for the  US decision to end the so-called FNI treaty. The treaties today between  the United States and Russia, negotiated during the Cold War, no longer  exist. The FNI treaty has been denounced by the United States, but I  remind you, it is our security that is at stake. It is that of the  European allies. And we can not remain in a situation where, having made  the best efforts to first avoid the violation of these treaties by  Russia, then this American decision, we would simply be here to find  that we are no longer covered by this agreement. bilateral. That is why  it is imperative for me, too, in our work and in our discussions next  week, to tackle this issue head-on in the Alliance, first and foremost  in the dialogue between Europe and Russia to recreate the conditions of  our security in the real world, that is to say, that of today. And the  new generation of agreements that I want, which will replace the INF  Treaty, must be the subject of a lot of work and coordination within the  Alliance and especially between the countries of Europe, but it  supposes an implication of the Europeans in this future treaty. We can  not delegate our security to a bilateral agreement or no European is  involved. And, secondly, it assumes to better protect some European  countries there too. Some countries, such as Poland, were not protected  by the FNI Treaty as it should be. And I hope that in this framework  that we build, we can take all security interests into account,  especially those that are closest to the border and the closest to  Russia. On this subject - we may come back to this during the questions -  a lot of echoes in recent days have awakened following the French  response to President Putin's letter: I prefer to be clear on this  point. First, France had the courtesy to share its letter of response to  President Putin with all Allies. This was not the case for all Allies. I  think it's a good method.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
Then we  absolutely did not accept the moratorium proposed by Russia or the  moratorium offer. But we considered that, as a basis for discussion, it  should not be dismissed by hand: because it was a basis for discussion  and because what was proposed was the end of a treaty, with nothing  else. Be serious. This is again the security of Europe.",,/r/europe/comments/e3cojy/russia_is_no_longer_our_enemy_macron_tells_nato/f92g04k/,Hurgen1,1575029367

81,"&gt;I did not say Marxism advocates for reformism. You are simply not reading what I am saying and for some reason believe that the state is always capitalist, which is not true.

It absolutely is if you understand why the state exists, as i explained in my previous comment, the state only exists because of contradictions in capitalism requiring a centralised point of power and a monopoly on violence in society to control the working class with opposing class interest to the ruling class.

Using the state during a transitional period is reformist, you 1. Keeping the capitalist production alive (temporarily) to 2. Reform it away using the power of the state.

The problem with this is that reforming away capitalism is impossible and will lead to major longterm economic problems as the transition period would take decades if not centuries.

The owners of the state, the new oligarchs in control of the state would in this society be extent also own the production, they would (just like the ministers in the soviet union) become the new capitalists.

They would not give up their newfound position of power in society, just as the current bourgeois wont.


&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_state#Marxist_theory_of_the_state
&gt;
&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictatorship_of_the_proletariat

Ahh, we have arrived at the dictatorship of the proletariat, arguably the most widely mis-interpereted concept Marx had.

First of at the time of creation dictatorship did not mean what is means today, whereas today it means one of a small groups of people controlling everyone, in the time of Marx it simply meant the control of one group over another.

What the dictatorship of the proletariat means is, the control over society of the proletariat. We currently have a dictatorship of the Capitalists.

The goal of the dictatorship of the proletariat would be to exclude the interests of any class besides the proletariat from having influence in society.


&gt;I have never said socialism is about the state controlling production. Your reading comprehension needs improvement.

You have repeatedly attempted to make the point that socialism is a transitionary period in which the state is taken control of, correct?

&gt;If I've managed to get anything into your skull, then let it be this: **You cannot have socialism without a state.** End of story.

Well here you just answered my previous question, you do not understand socialism if you believe this, you do not understand what revolution means, you do not understand what role the state has in capitalist society, and therefore you do not understand the goals of socialism if you believe it requires a state.

178,"**The UK should learn from France’s tech visa**

It’s the Groundhog Day the UK tech workforce never asked for. Repeated extensions to Brexit proceedings have prolonged the uncertainty felt by the sector.  

Although there have been efforts to portray the UK as open for business, European workers have been left wondering what their future holds. Should they hold out or hedge their bets on more stable shores? The latest proposals by the Conservative government to move to a points-based immigration system, similar to that of Australia, have brought little extra clarity. 

For London to sustain its digital dominance on the continental stage, let alone globally, the UK needs to strengthen its position on immigration and turn rhetoric into action.

**The ‘French Revolution’ in tech**

There may be trouble on the doorstep. Despite record volumes of venture capital investment in London tech, including encouraging contributions from Asia, 2019 has seen the rapid expansion of the tech ecosystem to some of its closest neighbours. France seems next in line to try for the European throne, having reportedly overtaken Germany in terms of investment in its startups. Berlin remains a successful tech hub, so what is France doing right?

The answer lies at the top. While President Macron has fostered an environment conducive to tech investment through labour reforms and access to tax credits, his ‘coup de maître’ has been the introduction of a new tech visa. This has been a key catalyst to French success and, increasingly, a point of differentiation between France and the UK. Its flexibility has been an important factor — renewable after four years, allowing holders to change companies within France, and with fewer eligibility restrictions for businesses and employees than the previous iteration.

Attempts to replicate this across the Channel have not been as successful. Only two of the UK’s new ‘Innovator’ visas have been granted to overseas entrepreneurs in the first three months it was available. In contrast, the French tech sector is actively importing talent and cashing in on the wariness surrounding the UK. Macron has turned Paris into a hotbed for tech investment and consequently an alluring location for overseas talent.

**Open the doors wide**

With the UK no closer to clarity over post-Brexit immigration policy for its workforce it must adapt to stay at the helm of European tech. Investing in the education system to make digital into a fundamental part of the curriculum, from primary school to university, is important. But nurturing a new generation of home-grown talent will not address the shortage soon enough.

The ‘Startup’ visa and ‘Innovator’ visa routes introduced by the Home Office in April were welcome initiatives and much needed positive engagement from Westminster. However, they clearly need to be re-assessed and haven’t made the same impact as the system in France. We need to go further. Tech London Advocates has long called for the cap to be lifted on Tier two work visas, which would send a message to the global tech community that the UK welcomes them.

Another reason for the success of the French tech visa has been the low administrative costs. To counter this obstacle in the UK the government must introduce third-party visa sponsorship, to both reduce costs for applicants and decrease the administrative burden on the public sector. It would provide a vitally important sector-led perspective, which cannot always be accurately communicated on a visa application.

Finally, the process for an overseas graduate at a UK university to transition from a Tier four student visa to a Tier two work visa has historically been marred in complexity. If overseas workers are proving hard to attract, then we need to make it easier for students to stay and work in the UK once they finish their studies. Some of our most successful UK businesses were founded by foreign entrepreneurs; not only have they transferred their knowledge to the sector but built businesses and traded back to their home countries where they have links. Removing the excessive bureaucracy will incentivise tech innovators and talent hoping to stay in the UK.

**It’s now or never**

We have the financial capital — now we need to re-evaluate our immigration position or risk a significant shortage in human capital. Brexit may be a prominent reason for the success of the French tech visa as European talent looks to hubs beyond London, but that only places more onus on evolving our system to make the UK more appealing and reflect the positive contribution of foreign skilled workers.

Brexit gives Paris, Berlin and other cities a window to capitalise on uncertainty and catch up with London. So London must send a clear signal to tech talent that it wants them. Amid the political chaos we can’t forget the impact Brexit is having on our most prized industry and its workforce. Britain’s door is half open to overseas tech talent — we must open it fully to stay ahead.

211,"The rich capitalist countries were rich before they were capitalist and most of that wealth came from colonialism. Causing or perpetuating huge inequality of wealth from feudalism in both colonizing and colonized countries.

Meanwhile most communist countries started with very little and industrializing faster than capitalist countries with the same start. Inequality was much lower too, especially compared to countries with similar GDPPPP.

Any sort of claim of meritocratic results of capitalism have to be evaluated against the reality of your future earnings mostly being decided by the earnings in which you grow up.

How come more equal societies have more social mobility, which is maybe the only way to hint at a measure of merit?

And you act as if in the Soviet Union a farmer's son or daughter never became a scientist. Social mobility was AT LOWEST ESTIME I COULD FIND more like Britain's.

313,"Italy is the only European country with a law against [""mafia association""](https://it.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associazione_di_tipo_mafioso) for example. 

That means, that here in Italy if someone has proven contacts with specific shady people/companies or even acts in a certain way, it can be immediately prosecuted and all his assets can be confiscated according to this law. Then starts a legal process and the police can  investigate to discover the other nodes of the organization.

It's nothing like normal crime, since mafiosi (especially those belonging to 'Ndrangheta) are extremely loyal to their boss, and a single criminal probably doesn't even know how all the organization is structured.

It's a bit like with Al Capone. The American Police knew he was a gangster, knew he was the big boss, but didn't have proofs that could be called evidence. The same happened and still happens in Germany, where investigations against Ndrangheta are carried out mostly by Italian Police (with Interpol) because German police can't legally arrest those criminals based on crimes they do not have laws for.

In conclusion, it's not that those laws didn't work. The very fact that this map exists is because the Police is carrying out investigations about them. Every 2 or 3 month you hear about big police raids where they arrest even 40 or 50 mafiosi all throughout Italy after years of investigations. It's a long and difficult process, but it allowed to fight Cosa Nostra effectively (especially after they [declared war to the Italian State](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capaci_bombing)), and today Sicilian mafia is just a shadow of its former self. 

However as I said, it requires specific laws, even for detention, like [41 bis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_41-bis_prison_regime). This last law was used against THE big boss of Cosa Nostra (Totó Riina, that order the killing of hundreds of people, even kids) for example, and it was the only thing he feared. 

ECHR criticised it multiple times, but really they don't realise how you have to deal with these kind of people (the big ones  at least) because they actually don't know anything about mafia.",Italy,/r/europe/comments/e2zixi/organized_crime_in_italy_by_mafia_family_and_by/f920bsj/,Gherol,1575007413

321,"&gt;Energy mixes is where it's at.

I agree. Majority nuclear with as much renewables as we can fit on the side. There's no feasible way to have a comparable space required to power output ratio with renewables as you'd have with nuclear. Same goes for reliability and the capacity to upscale energy production durung greater need.

&gt;There's a lot more to nuclear power plant siting than just having a stream nearby.

Absolutely. Nuclear needs fuel, somewhat removed location, location not prone to natural disasters like arthquakes, all that jazz. A good source of coolant water is however required, and that can be supplied by a stream strong enough to run a decently sized hydro plant. Like I said, I consider hydro to be the most viable renewable competitor to nuclear for the same reason nuclear completely crushes both wind and solar: namely consistent output of power, less affected by whims of nature, and taking up less space.

Coal, oil, and gas need to fuck off and die, and the only feasible way I see to achieve that goal without downgrading our energy grids reliability and output is with nuclear. Some countries may get away with more renewables, like Norway and my home country Finland because there's a ton of rivers and streams to support hydro plants, and the need for energy is quite low. Countries like France and Germany however may have no choice but to increase nuclear.",Finland,/r/europe/comments/e2wryz/european_parliament_declares_climate_emergency/f920j9y/,LordCloverskull,1575007634

Capitalism on the other hand is for the most part a strictly economy based ideology. Capitalism works in dictatorships aswell as in democracies. No other system has been as succesfull as capitalism to lift people out of poverty. Communism on the other hand just makes everybody poor except a few party leaders who can ironically live as oligarchs. It's true that capitalism has it's fault, which can be liftet somewhat through social security systems, but never fully eliminated.

482,"&gt; Getting sanctioned by that now really really powerful China will be interesting, especially if they use the same tactics the US tends to use. Any EU company that does deals with Poland will be punished in China.

You don't know how China would react. China and Russia aren't exactly best buddies, there weren't in the CW times and they aren't now. EU market is way more important for China than Russian market. China would not necessarily be interested in sacrificing its commercial interests in order to enable Russia to grow stronger and invade countries in Europe.

&gt; The moment the US, UK or France veto the UN resolution against Poland's nuclear program the NPT would be dead.

Why would it be dead? If Poland orderly left NPT, which would be a legal move, then what they did after leaving NPT would not necessarily affect NPT. Other countries could still be part of NPT like before. The question is whether Poland would be punished for leaving NPT.

It would of course depend a lot on the circumstances, and we can never know for sure, but in general, all powers are perfectly capable of applying double standards and if a nuclear Poland saved them the trouble of worrying against Russia, then they may find a way to rationalize why it's okay for Poland to have NW. The same they did with Israel, India and Pakistan.

Contrary to popular belief, NW do not have to be dangerous per se, neither Poland nor Belarus have irrational terror groups on its soil, hence there is no worry that they could fall into the hands of some kind of deat cult. And in the hands of relatively rational players, NW can serve as a deterrent and prevent a conflict. They are a big reason why there never was an open conflict between the US and USSR and why there hopefully won't be an open conflict between China and the US.

Of course I am not saying that it would have zero negative consequences for Poland, but if Poland is left alone against Russia, which would be the only situation where it would need nuclear weapons, the negative consequences may not be as bad, as you know, being invaded by Russia.

Of course Germany and France wouldn't really like a nuclear Poland, but they may close their eyes to it, if it means that Russia does not get closer to their borders without them having to invest significantly more in defending Eastern Europe.",Czech Republic,/r/europe/comments/e2ynhb/macron_says_nato_should_shift_its_focus_away_from/f91yczi/,kristynaZ,1575005380

497,"I'm qualified to rebut you as someone who holds opinions you've alluded to in an unusually nasty way.  I detest your rhetoric; I am not convinced you have the ethics to wield the weapons that you hefted.

Murder and child molestation are what I consider the death lines after which capital punishment would be justified if we could ascertain their commission with absolute certainty.  I oppose the death penalty, because I do not consider there to be an acceptable death rate.

Murder justifies a death line because it inflicts a death of the body.  It is simple reciprocity.  It is also what I consider ""dark"" or warrior reciprocity, but in this line I tolerate it; the most proper use of force is force contra force.

Child molestation justifies a death line because it inflicts a death of the mind.  Victims of child molestation suffer personality splintering and myriad psychological disorders.  Their potential in life is substantially impaired.

The existence of neither death line constitutes a withdrawal of human rights, but rather both death lines serve to reinforce human rights.  Quite simply: we must be alive to have human rights.  It is approximately the same principle by which we punish people lightly or not at all for roughness inflicted in the course of saving someone's life.  Is it a violation of someone's rights to be roughed up?  Indeed!  Yet we protect rights in priority order when pressured, and adopt the principle of triage, whereby the greater and more foundational right is the right to be alive to have rights.

Furthermore, you have used your obvious ethical deficiencies to embed a revolting lie.  ""A growing group place that line at being anything but a straight white monogamous Christian.""  A GROWING group?  Did you not notice that even Tunisia now has sex education?  It is not the Christian tradition to be enslaved to abuses and hostile to fully reciprocal ethics.  Most societies have been growing more tolerant and more honest in the recent decades.  The group of people who you ostensibly claim to viciously hate - yet dishonestly proclaim the success of - reveals, I suspect, your true master.  Take your chains off.  People have more dignity in life when they have pride enough to live without the shattered obeisance that breaks the warrior into endless hatreds.",,/r/europe/comments/e30ez7/german_murderer_paul_termann_wins_right_to_be/f91ylvy/,ShengjiYay,1575005627

528,"The level of rewriting and revising of history in Hungary is disturbing. Hungary wants to talk about ""victims of communism"" when Hungarian forces committed aggression against in Russia in 1941 and some 500,000 Hungarian troops were in Hungarian prisoner of war camps.

Hungary is responsible for the extermination of 550,000 Hungarian Jews. In May 1944 the deportations to Auschwitz began. In just eight weeks, some 424,000 Jews were deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau. After October 1944, when the Arrow Cross party came to power, thousands of Jews from Budapest were murdered on the banks of the Danube and tens of thousands were marched hundreds of kilometers towards the Austrian border.

The nature and methods of the actions by Hungarian troops against against Russian citizens were criminal: 

A. I. Krutukhin, a peasant in the village of Svetlovo in Russia's Bryansk region, said:  “The Hungarian fascist accomplices of the entered our village. All the inhabitants of our village hid from such a pack and they are a sign that the residents began to hide from them, and those who did not know how to hide, they shot them and raped several of our women. In the entire the village there were killings, burning buildings, and Hungarian soldiers looted our belongings and stole our livestock"" For 1941-1943 only in Chernigov region and the surrounding villages, Hungarian troops take part in the extermination of 60,000 Russian citizens. 

And instead of owning up to its past and atoning for its crimes, Hungarian government rewrites history.

In Hungary, there has been adulation for political leaders who carried out the Nazis’ bidding regarding deportation of the Jews. In Hungary, major foreign Jewish figures have protested these outrages by returning honors awarded by the state. The two best-known cases are Elie Wiesel and Randolph Braham.  In 2012, a statue of war criminal Horthy, who was involved in the Holocaust, was erected in Kereki in southwestern Hungary and in Csokako, a village in the country’s north, and a plaque in his honor was unveiled in Debrecen, Hungary’s second-largest city.

If the co2 cant get into the water, the plants and aninals there cant recycle it.

Even then the issue with top water is obscenely convoluted. For example. Oil seeps. Most oil wells are pressurized, and because of that, all the small ones are pushing oil up into the ocean. At least in the case of oil seeps, our issue is that we are not pulling oil out fast enough. Mostly becayse these oil seeps dont represent profit, the cost to drill vs the profit on the oil inside is too low. So they just sit there all aling the coast of the western US, constantly seeping oil into the water.

684,"Chinese companies Huawei, Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo, Lenovo hold about 50% of the global market share for smartphone sales. Apple has only a 10% market share and the Koreans with Samsung + LG have about a 25% market share. European countries and Japan don't make anything worth buying when it comes to consumer electronics. And other than Apple, which is declining, the United States doesn't have anything noteworthy. Clearly, countries like the United States and some European countries feel jealous and threatened that China is progressing and prospering while their countries are stagnating.

In many parts of the world, China is easily destroying the United States in smartphone sales. In India, Chinese Xiaomi and Oppo enjoy a 35% market share compared to only 2% for Apple. In Russia, Huawei and Xiaomi enjoy a 30% market share compared to 15% for Apple. In Egypt, Chinese companies hold almost a 50% market share vs. only 10% for Apple. And in Spain, Huawei and Xiaomi have a 40% market share vs. 20% for Apple.

I own the Huawei Matebook X Pro laptop and it's a beautiful, smooth, fast machine with strong battery life. It only cost me $1200, while a comparable Apple model costs $1800. Huawei's P30 smartphone right now is only going for a $500 for 128 GB storage, 6GB Ram, 2340x1080 resolution, and a 40 MP camera. Apple's Iphone 11 Pro goes for $1100.

What's going on is that some European countries and the United States have an irrational paranoia and anti-Chinese prejudice that goes back many, many years. In 1945-1949, the United States went against the Chinese revolution and backed up an unpopular regime that ended up being defeated and running away to Taiwan propped up by American gunboats. In 1950, the United States strong-armed some European countries like France, Britain, Belgium, the Netherlands to join it in an invasion of Korea, a country that was in an alliance with China. The invasion of Korea forced China to defend herself and her ally. At one point, elements in the United States government even threatened to use nuclear bombs on China.

And my poiny still stands that you can't build an military alliance with a partner who killed your citizens, create wars at your frontiers and finance extremist parties in order to undermine the political union you live in. Doing that is called ""appeasement "" and history taught us how great it was !

De Gaulle wasn't a russian shill but rather blindly anti-american, because americans posed and still pose a direct threat to France's military power in Europe and Africa. Nothing more than that

Here's an excerpt from ""Der Verlust des Mitgefühls"" from Arno Gruen which I put through a translator:

&gt; The following example shows how subliminal such mechanisms function (cf. Tages-Anzeiger, T.A., Zurich, 11.2.1994). When a seventy-seven-year-old man gets out of a tram, he feels hindered by another man because he is talking to the driver and he blocks the exit. The older man pulls a revolver, fires four shots at the other from a distance of two to three metres and disappears. By chance, the shooter is recognized four weeks later in a restaurant and arrested. He denies having fired, but carries a gun without a licence. During the search of his house, the police discover an armoury. Finally, the man confesses the crime. However, he claims to have acted ""in the heat of the moment"", to have been ""frightened"" by the other.

&gt; A judicial investigation is initiated and then discontinued. According to the public prosecutor's statement, the seventy-seven-year-old man had been in an ""error of fact"". He had mistakenly assumed that he was in a self-defence situation and had therefore been entitled to defend himself. According to the prosecutor, it was understandable that he reacted ""oversensitively to aggressive tensions and statements"".

&gt; ""What did I do,"" the victim asked a journalist, ""that he was allowed to shoot at me?

&gt; How should we understand the ""compassion"" of this prosecutor? Why does she side with the perpetrator and not protect other citizens from him? Doesn't her attitude give everyone permission to murder? What kind of compassion is this that pushes us against our own needs and interests, that makes us put aside the pain of the victim and denies the deadly danger that emanates from the perpetrator?",Germany,/r/europe/comments/e2z0e4/three_teens_admit_threatening_women_who_refused/f90gqzr/,neinMC,1574972123

The Palestinians use kids as soldiers and [Suicide bombers](https://static.timesofisrael.com/jewishndev/uploads/2015/02/Hamas11.jpg) and send them to blow up on Israelis..  in reality, the Israelis are forced to choose between saving their kids or the kids who try to kill their kids.

The Actual facts are:

* Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005. without a blockade, to the holy UN '67 line. AND REMOVED ALL SettLmEntS from Gaza

* in 2006, Gaza elected Hamas, since Hamas brainwashed the ppl ""We made the Zionist go away using our weapons!'' they saw Israeli withdrawal a weakness instead of a chance for Peace.

* Hamas imported missiles and [started shooting into Israeli cities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Palestinian_rocket_attacks_on_Israel,_2007) from the very same land Israel gave them (prior Egyptian territory)

* Israel blockaded Gaza in 2007

* 2018/19 Hamas use child soldiers to breach the international border between Israel and the De Facto state of Gaza.

The funny thing is that you are on r/europe which is known for left wing bias, you speak of your high horse but i doubt you even go outside of r/europe to read what opponents say.

Trump case facts:

Here are the facts so far from Biden case:
- Biden son worked for burisma at the time when Biden was VP and handled Ukraine
- Burisma was investigated by head prosecutor of ukraine.
- Biden publicly on tape braged about firing that prosecutor using aid money as leverage (something which democrats say is ""illegal"" and ""impeachement case"")
- Mentioned prosecutor was removed.
- That prosecutor swore under oath (before whole thing started) that he was fired because of Biden and investigation into Burisma.

Trump impeachement case:
- there is 0 direct evidence mentioning any hold up of aid money
- transcript doesn't say anything about Trump extorting Zelensky
- Zelensky said multiple times on record that there wasn't any extorsion
- none of the witnesses in impeachment case, were first hand witnesses. All of them ""heard someone saying someone herd something""

r/europe and rest of ""sudo-leftwing(but not really)"" us press were also believing 100% Trump worked with Russians. And yet Muller report directly stated they found no evidence of that, none of people who broke the law had anything to do with Russians.

The funny thing is that you are on r/europe which is known for left wing bias, you speak of your high horse but i doubt you even go outside of r/europe to read what opponents say.

Trump case facts:

Here are the facts so far from Biden case:

- Biden son worked for burisma at the time when Biden was VP and handled Ukraine
- Burisma was investigated by head prosecutor of ukraine.
- Biden publicly on tape braged about firing that prosecutor using aid money as leverage (something which democrats say is ""illegal"" and ""impeachement case"")
- Mentioned prosecutor was removed.
- That prosecutor swore under oath (before whole thing started) that he was fired because of Biden and investigation into Burisma.

Trump impeachement case:

- there is 0 direct evidence mentioning any hold up of aid money
- transcript doesn't say anything about Trump extorting Zelensky
- Zelensky said multiple times on record that there wasn't any extorsion
- none of the witnesses in impeachment case, were first hand witnesses. All of them ""heard someone saying someone herd something""

r/europe and rest of ""sudo-leftwing(but not really)"" us press were also believing 100% Trump worked with Russians. And yet Muller report directly stated they found no evidence of that, none of people who broke the law had anything to do with Russians. Each of them were sentenced either by lying to FBI or tax evasion.

So yes you are propagandist claiming i am propagandist.

European Parliament resolution of 28 November 2019 on the climate and environment
emergency (2019/2930(RSP))
The European Parliament,
– having regard to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
(UNFCCC) and the Kyoto Protocol thereto,
– having regard to the Agreement adopted at the 21st Conference of the Parties to the
UNFCCC (COP21) in Paris on 12 December 2015 (the Paris Agreement),
– having regard to the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD),
– having regard to the latest and most comprehensive scientific evidence on the damaging
effects of climate change provided in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s
(IPCC) special report entitled ‘Global Warming of 1,5°C’, its fifth assessment report
(AR5) and its synthesis report thereon, its special report on climate change and land,
and its special report on the ocean and cryosphere in a changing climate,
– having regard to the massive threat of loss of biodiversity described in the summary for
policymakers of the global assessment report on biodiversity and ecosystem services of
the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem
Services, of 29 May 2019,
– having regard to the 25th Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC (COP25), to be
held in Madrid, Spain, from 2–13 December 2019,
– having regard to the 26th Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC to be held in
December 2020 and the fact that all Parties to the UNFCCC need to increase their
nationally determined contributions in line with the objectives of the Paris Agreement,
– having regard to the 15th Conference of Parties to the Convention on Biological
Diversity (COP15) to be held in Kunming, China, in October 2020, where Parties need
to decide on the post-2020 global framework to halt biodiversity loss,
– having regard to its resolution of 14 March 2019 on climate change – a European
strategic long-term vision for a prosperous, modern, competitive and climate neutraleconomy in accordance with the Paris Agreement 1 ,
– having regard to its resolution of 28 November 2019 on the 2019 UN Climate Change
Conference in Madrid, Spain (COP25) 2 ,
– having regard to Rule 132(2) and (4) of its Rules of Procedure,
A. whereas immediate and ambitious action is crucial to limiting global warming to 1,5° C
and avoiding massive biodiversity loss;
B. whereas this action must be science-based and must involve citizens and all sectors of
society and the economy, including industry, in a socially balanced and sustainable
way; whereas it must support the competitiveness of our economies and be
accompanied by strong social and inclusive measures to ensure a fair and equitable
transition that supports job creation, while respecting the need for a high standard of
welfare and high quality jobs and training;
C. whereas no emergency should ever be used to erode democratic institutions or to
undermine fundamental rights; whereas all measures will always be adopted through a
democratic process;
1. Declares a climate and environment emergency; calls on the Commission, the Member
States and all global actors, and declares its own commitment, to urgently take the
concrete action needed in order to fight and contain this threat before it is too late;
2. Urges the new Commission to fully assess the climate and environmental impact of all
relevant legislative and budgetary proposals, and ensure that they are all fully aligned
with the objective of limiting global warming to under 1,5 °C, and that they are not
contributing to biodiversity loss;
3. Recognises its institutional responsibility to reduce its carbon footprint; proposes to
adopt its own measures to reduce emissions, including replacing its fleet vehicles with
zero-emissions vehicles, and calls on all the Member States to agree to a single seat for
the European Parliament;
4. Urges the new Commission to address the inconsistencies of current Union policies on
the climate and environment emergency, in particular through a far-reaching reform of
its agricultural, trade, transport, energy and infrastructure investment policies;
5. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission and the
governments and parliaments of the Member States.",European Union,/r/europe/comments/e2wryz/european_parliament_declares_climate_emergency/f8z4q35/,Neker,1574956839

I actually can. Russian communism was an insanely mismanaged mess of a system.

1036,"I didn't really understand this.

FITs are fixed per kWh payment above retail price that certain power generators receive for each kWh they sell. These are paid from the government budget so they come from taxes. I didn't mean particularly from the surcharges added to electricity price. I do not know the particularities of German electricity pricing and whether this EEG is the feed in tariff mechanism there. I just said that wholesale electricity price doesn't contain the FIT, and without FIT it would be higher. And I didn't say it's the ""sole reason"" either.

France also has solar/wind FIT mechanisms active...

&gt;Also Frances also susbsides their Energy through taxes, the biggest Energy Company is even state owned and even have part in the second biggest.

Every state-owned energy company is subsidized to some level. Even public energy companies get all kinds of subsidies, even if they're indirect ones. But just because EdF is state owned doesn't give us a quantitative number of the direct subsidy level comparable to FIT, which is a per kWh number.

There is a way to backwards-ballpark it though. France's nuclear sector generates around 370 TWh per year. So if you can get a number of how much direct taxpayer subsidy is given to the company per year, divide the two numbers and you get a per kWh number. I have no idea how much this is. As a simple example, for 10c/kWh it'd have to be $37bn per year.",,/r/europe/comments/e2hyi0/the_germans_are_hitting_the_atom_the_eu_would/f8z5q3o/,zolikk,1574957187

&amp;#x200B;

A government does influence the judiciary by legislation (affecting both the judiciary as an organization and the law they apply), which is inevitable and hence, normal.

&gt; but usually these people hold these positions for a long time, which leads to a rotation system in the long run. 

Long terms tend to encourage independence, life appointments (which we don't employ at the CC) even more. In fact, some of Fidesz's appointees to the CC did distance themselves from their sponsor over their term in the CC, but since Fidesz holds a majority (which is, for most of the time, a supermajority) since 2010, the CC leans increasingly towards Fidesz. Some of the regluation changes affecting the CC were actually welcome, such as relieving them from the burden of dealing with the constutionality of municipality regulations (there are 3200 municipal local governments in Hungary, which is borderline insane). On the other hand, any meaningful opposition attempt could (and was) cut short by amending the Constitution - but of course, one could reasonably argue that a supermajority is well within its rights to amend it.

There's been talks this autumn about another amendment, but that has been put to rest with the unexpected results of the municipal elections. It seems that Fidesz is more wary of shifts in the political landscape (both on the domestic and on the EU/EP stage, as the administrative courts were likely used as a bargaining chip on the latter) than of jurisprudential arguments.",Hungary,/r/europe/comments/e2hd2y/hungary_pulls_out_of_eurovision_amid_rise_in/f8y9qfk/,StatementsAreMoot,1574943602

German intentions are irrelevant.

And Germany caused this misconception by ignoring European rules, without consulting with the rest of the EU. You reap what you sow.

&gt; Germany doesn't need to consult EU members. 

Awesome approach, this will surely go down well with other EU members.

&gt; But what Germany did was tell countries like Poland what the EU is about: Solidarity with other EU member states. 

Excellent, I am glad to hear Germany will be cancelling Nord Stream 2 in solidarity with Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, stop appeasing Putin about Ukraine and increase its military spending to ensure proper protection of the EU's eastern borders. Solidarity is awesome!

As mentioned Rome's biggest military disasters before they started to decline came down to nationalist zeal in the case of Cannae and pride in the case of Carrhae. And yes militarist superpowers tend to have strong nationalist currents, which is one of the reasons they have all these wars and some of them become the ""great nations"" (while 99% have a short history of bloodshed and then perish). The British empire doesn't have the best reputation nowadays and neither does the USA, their great nations are mostly known nowadays for warmongering, warcrimes and fucking regions up long term.

Hell I'm pretty sure that if I go down the genocide list in wikipedia tribalism/nationalism and ethnic separation played a large role in 99% of them, because to massacre people on a large scale you first need to demonize them which is the modus operandi of nationalist zealots.

1399,"&gt; This is a fact very few tankies know: there were free elections in 1917 and commies lost them.

The fact that you are willfully ignoring: it was Bolsheviks themselves who made those elections happen. Provisional Government was constantly trying to postpone or avoid having those elections.

&gt; So just two months later bolsheviks dispersed constituent assembly by force.

Bullshit.

Activity of Assembly was suspended not by force, but because Assembly could not function. After Right-wingers boycotted Left (Bolsheviks and Left SR), **Assembly no longer had a quorum to pass anything** (400 out of ~715 delegates were necessary and Right-wingers did not have enough).

This is why Assembly did not reconvene: Right-wingers shut it down to force unconditional surrender of Bolsheviks (i.e. abolition of all Soviet decrees as unlawful) and refused to negotiate until their demands are met.

Bolsheviks simply called their bluff, waited for a week, and then recognized Soviets (direct democracy) as the only functioning government in Russia.

The only use of ""force"" is when guards of the building asked the Right-wing delegates to leave the building (giving them ample time to debate; it was 5 a.m. *next day*), as they had no right to use the building forever.

I'm guessing *this* is the fact very few Right-wingers know (or are willing to admit).

&gt; And started civil war to assume control over country 

There was no Civil War until the summer of 1918, when Western nations invaded Soviet Russia.

This is not just xenophobia, mind you; there are reasonable arguments against this, chiefly that it is *unenforceable*. Most people claiming asylum want to go to Germany or Sweden (because they've been fed stupid stories about those countries by people traffickers and social networks). So imagine a Syrian guy who wants to be in Germany is instead sent to the Czech Republic. What will he do? Sit on his butt here, taking 1/5th of the benefits he would receive in Germany? Nope. He'll go to Germany. This will happen in 90+% of cases. What will happen then? Germany will blame Czechia for ""non-compliance"" with EU quota policy; politicians in Bavaria and Saxony will demand border checks on the German-Czech border to ""ensure"" that refugees allocated to Czechia are not leaving for Germany. A pressure will mount on the Czech gov. to do something about it. By doing something they mean ""lock these people up in refugee centres so that they cannot leave"". Well, Czech gov. can do that and then a Western journalist will publish a feature on how evil racist Eastern Europeans keep poor asylum-seekers locked up in ""concentration camps"" in inhumane conditions.

Then there is the issue of national sovereignty in the area of immigration, which is a touchy subject since people believe it should be people living in the country choosing who they let in, which is also linked to the issue of security. Also, this would relieve the pressure on the EU to deal with the refugee problem comprehensively by enacting better border protection and processing of asylum of claimants outside the EU's territory.

1672,"In 2018, households in the European Union (EU) spent almost €2 100 bn (equivalent to 13.0% of EU GDP) on ‘Housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels’.

This represents 24.0% of their total consumption expenditure and is by far the EU's largest household expenditure item, ahead of ‘Transport’ (13.2%), ‘Food and non-alcoholic beverages’ (12.1%), ‘Recreation and culture’ (9.1%) as well as ‘Restaurants and hotels’ (8.7%).

 The remaining household spending was distributed over 'Furnishings, household equipment and routine household maintenance' (5.4%), 'Clothing and footwear' (4.7%), 'Alcoholic beverages, tobacco and narcotics' and 'Health' (both 3.9%), 'Communications' (2.3%), 'Education' (1.2%) and ‘Other’ (11.4%) – which together represented 32.8% of total expenditure in 2018.

A more complete overview of household final consumption expenditure, broken down by consumption purpose, is available in this [interactive infographics](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/news/themes-in-the-spotlight/household-expenditure-2018).

**Finland, Denmark and Slovakia spend highest share of household expenditure on housing, Malta spends least**

In the vast majority of EU Member States, ‘Housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels’ represents the most substantial item of household expenditure.

In 2018, the share of household expenditure devoted to housing was largest in Finland (28.5%), Denmark (28.1%) and Slovakia (27.7%). They were followed by France (26.3%), the United Kingdom (26.0%), Sweden (25.9%) and Czechia (25.2%).

In contrast, Malta (10.3%), Lithuania (15.0%) and Cyprus (15.1%) spent the lowest share of their household expenditure on housing.

Finland recorded highest increase in housing expenditure

Of all household expenditure main items, housing was the item that saw the most significant increase in spending over the last decade in the EU, rising from a share of 23.2% of total household expenditure in 2008 to 24.0% in 2018 (or +0.8 percentage points (pp)).

Between 2008 and 2018, the share of ‘Housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels’ in total household expenditure grew in most Member States. The highest increase was recorded in Finland (from 23.7% of total household expenditure in 2008 to 28.5% in 2018, or a rise of 4.8 percentage points (pp)), ahead of the Netherlands (+3.1 pp), Portugal (+2.7 pp), Bulgaria (+2.5 pp), Ireland and Spain (both +2.1 pp) and  Luxembourg (+2.0 pp).

In contrast, this share dropped in 10 EU Member States: Slovakia (from 30.6% in 2008 to 27.7% in 2018, or a decrease of 2.9 pp), followed by Hungary (-2.1 pp), Germany and Latvia (-1.7), Malta (-1.3 pp), Cyprus (-1.0 pp), Poland (-0.7 pp), Sweden (-0.4 pp), the United Kingdom (-0.3 pp) and Czechia (-0.1 pp), while it remained stable in Lithuania.",,/r/europe/comments/e2ti63/household_expenditure_in_the_eu/f8xihb2/,boemul,1574919851

If we want just to describe the reality, then someone fleeing war-torn country does not stop to be refugee just because he used working visa as a perfectly legal way for migration.

If we want to stick to some bureaucratic/legal language, things may be different.

Talking legal way is perfect when phrasing treaties.

The point about it all being paid in a year is also pure bullshit, since the reserves are an absolute resource, not something that replenishes year by year. Sell our gold and our dollars in year 1 and they won't reappear in year 2.

The fact that Corbyn has essentially pledged off the cuff to wipe out the entire UK net reserve of all foreign currencies and gold to nearly fund one policy (he'd still be several billion quid short) demonstrates how fucking stupid Labour's policymaking has become. Those funds are vital for our ability to regulate the value of sterling, for government services to make payments overseas and (crucially, to my mind) for the UK to fulfil the requirements of its IMF membership.

But we were *hella homophobic* like anywhere else to significant degrees, and in large part it still wasn't socially acceptable to be *openly* supportive even after those staunchly against homosexuality became a minority. The 00s were a sea change for western Europe's views on homosexuality. At the start of the millennium only a few countries even had ""partnerships"", and then the Netherlands set off the chain reaction of acceptability in 2001. I was a kid at elementary school then, and ""you're gay"" was still the ultimate zinger. The attitude change was *enormous* in just a few years.

even if exaggerated, it doesn't paint a pretty picture.

They give the situation themselves, don't they. Half of the period were wars and occupations.

&gt;Also devaluation works when you have sovereign currency, not when you're part of Euro and your incompetence and devaluation would reflect on half of EU countries.

This gives even more options - the ECB could have done the same with much less effort, for the same beneficial effect except the export boost (which is a mixed blessing anyway as you also lose buying power). And the ironic thing is, *they have done so by now*. But not after unnecessarily waiting for two years, during which the Greek debt snowballed, and the interest rates of sovereign debt snowballed around the Eurozone because of this policy, causing unnecessary debt all over the Eurozone.

That being said, devaluation should certainly not be the first choice, and internal reforms in Greece were necessary.

1940,"What about ""Serbo-Croato-Slovene"", which was the official language in the ""Kingdom of Yugoslavia"". What happened to that language? 

Serbo-Croatian is part of German speech imperialism.

The word first originated in the foreword of the translation of the first serbian dictionary ""Srpski rječnik by  [Vuk Stefanović Karadžić](https://sr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%92%D1%83%D0%BA_%D0%A1%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%84%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%9B_%D0%9A%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%9F%D0%B8%D1%9B)"" into German in the year 1824. The translation was written by Jakob Grimm, known mainly as one of the Grimm brothers . So the word was neither in use by Croats nor by Serbs and is the invention of a German linguist.  The same goes for the the term ""Balkan"", which was popularized by  Johann August Zeune in his 1808 publication (first mention of the term ""Balkan peninsula""), which was later used by Serbian nationalists. Both termini, i.e. Balkan and Serbo-Croatian, are dismissed by the vast majority of Croatian historians and intellectuals. 

Croatian dictionaries were first written in the 16th century, more than 200-300 years before a Serbian dictionary even existed. That was also the reasoning behind Jakob Grimm's term ""Serbo-Croatian"". He didn't see enough originality in Vuk Karadzic's dictionary, so he thought it was a Serbian version of Croatian. 

Only Serbian nationalists would think that ""Serbo-"" as prefix, would somehow mean that Croatian is a sublanguage of  Serbian, which is what they propagated for decades.

Even Karadzic himself admitted that he doubts about the originality of his dictionary:

*  *""Svi Slavenski narodi kromě Serbalja vostočnog' věroispovědanija  imaju svoje Rěčnike. Mi ga sami trebamo...Ja sam takovij Rěčnik  preduzeo, i već skupio. On će pomenutim' potrebama udovletvoriti.  Soderžavaće sve Serbske rěči, koe se nalaze u Rěčnicima: Kurcbekovom'  (koi e samo imenom Serbskij), Dellabelli, Belostencu, Jambrešiću,  Stulliju, Voltičžiu, Hajmu; a imaće jošt' ednu tretinu pravih Srbskih'  rěčij, koe se ni u ednome, ot rečenih Rěčnika,﻿ ne nalaze.""* (""U  Fruškogorskom' Monastiru Šišatovcu 20ga Marta 1816.; Sabrana dela Vuka  Karadžića, 2. tom, Prosveta, Beograd, 1966.: ""Objavlenie o serbskome  rěčniku"") 
*  *""{Srbi s pisanjem na narodnom jeziku} nisu uranili prije druge  polovine osamnaestoga vijeka dok su braća zakona Rimskoga, osobito  Dubrovčani i Dalmatinci, pisali u šesnaestome vijeku u najveći jek!!""* (V.S. Karadžić: Skupljeni gramatički i polemički spisi, III., 1896., Beograd, str. 260.)
*  *""Da sam sve napečatio Hercegovački (npr. djevojka, djeca, vidjeti,  lećeti i pr.), onda bi rekli Sremci, a osobito varošani i varoške: pa  šta sada nama ovaj nameće Horvatskij jezik.""* (“Narodna srpska pesnarica, čast vtora, Beč, 1815., skupio Vuk Stefanović Karadžić”) 

Especially the last two quotes are of importance, since even Vuk Stefanović Karadžić, who invented the Greater-Serbian ideology and was an idol to people like Milosevic, ""admitts"" that there exists a ""*Horvatskij jezik"", i.e. ""Croatian language"".*

Later the term ""Serbo-Croatian"" was used mainly by those who propagated Ilyrianism and Panslavism, but not as a serious, scientific term, but as political term. It was thought that people would unify behind a Panslavic idea, which btw was seen as an enemy by Marx and Engels, who thought of Croats and Czechs as ""dogs"". For the German ""Übermensch-Ideology"" terms like ""Balkans"" and ""Serbo-Croatian"" were welcome. Since everything that generalised other people, underlined the individuality of the Germans.

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly a quote by another German speech-imperialist: Friedrich Engels in 

Der demokratische Panslawismus

\[""Neue Rheinische Zeitung"" Nr. 222 vom 15. Februar 1849\]:

""Wir denken nicht daran. Auf die sentimentalen Brüderschaftsphrasen,  die uns hier im Namen der kontrerevolutionärsten Nationen Europas  dargeboten werden, antworten wir, daß der Russenhaß die *erste revolutionäre Leidenschaft* bei  den Deutschen war und noch ist; daß seit der Revolution der Tschechen-  und Kroatenhaß hinzugekommen ist und daß wir, in Gemeinschaft mit Polen  und Magyaren, nur durch den entschiedensten Terrorismus gegen diese  slawischen Völker die Revolution sicherstellen können. Wir wissen jetzt,  wo die Feinde der Revolution konzentriert sind: in Rußland und den  östreichischen Slawenländern; und keine Phrasen, keine Anweisungen auf  eine unbestimmte demokratische Zukunft dieser Länder werden uns  abhalten, unsere Feinde als Feinde zu behandeln.

Und wenn Bakunin endlich ausruft:

""Wahrlich, nichts *einbüßen* soll der Slawe, sondern gewinnen soll er! Wahrlich, leben soll er! Und wir werden leben. *Solange* uns der *kleinste Teil* unsrer Rechte bestritten wird, solange *ein einziges Glied von unsrem gesamten Leibe abgetrennt oder losgerissen gehalten wird*, solange werden wir *bis aufs Blut,* werden wir unerbittlich *auf Tod und Leben kämpfen*, bis das Slawentum endlich groß und frei und unabhängig in der Welt dasteht"" -

wenn der revolutionäre Panslawismus diese Stelle ernstlich  meint und, wo es sich um die phantastisch-slawische Nationalität  handelt, die Revolution ganz aus dem Spiele läßt, dann wissen wir auch,  was wir zu tun haben.

Dann Kampf, ""unerbittlichen Kampf auf Leben und Tod"" mit dem  revolutionsverräterischen Slawentum; Vernichtungskampf und  rücksichtslosen Terrorismus - nicht im Interesse Deutschlands, sondern  im Interesse der Revolution!""

My own preference would be that the bot simply attach a stickied message about the nature of the source if it's been problematic, rather than delete stories from it.

So Corbyn dodges around the question for a while and Neil doesn't let him to do so, corners him extremely well for a while to finally get an answer. That's brilliant journalism but he also messed up at the end. Corbyn finally answers the question, then goes on about his talking points on the subject and as soon as he does, Neil says ""You can't tell how you'll pay for it"" despite the fact that he just finally got an answer on that. Then Corbyn points out that he just did in fact told him the answer, reitirates the answer. Then Neil tries to counter his answer with ""reserve doesn't have this money"" except the problem is he said it the first time Corbyn answered the question as well and Corbyn said ""it's not going to be paid all in a year"" which he ignored to say the same thing about reserve not having that money a 2nd time and Corbyn points out that it's not going to be paid all in one year again. 

I think the video cuts too soon because it cuts right as Neil goes ""alright, it still costs this much per year, where is that money in reserves"" which is a good question and overall brilliant journalism for most of it to force Corbyn to answer the question but there's also a lot of unnecessary subjective bullshit at the end there.",Turkey,/r/europe/comments/e2grrg/jeremy_corbyn_reveals_dossier_proving_nhs_up_for/f8w7y0k/,lavta,1574885104

&amp;#x200B;

 

The Mali mission was about helping a poor democratic african state when it was being invaded by ISIS and AlQuaida wannabe, who then teamed up with the touaregs in the north who were not really wanting to impose islamism on all of Mali but were pissed off at the gov ignoring their requests for more autonomy.

The Malian army did not have the training, the morale or the equipment and where being routed like crazy, to the point where a column of armed truck was marching on the south and its capital.

Mali made a plea to France in person and at the UN, France got troops there overnight, stopped the column, and kicked the extremists in the balls so hard US military think tanks used the operation as a demonstration of a capability that the US army should try and learn (recomposive/swarm units, ability for a miitary unit to work properly as single force, but also to dis-assemble in a dozen sub units that work just as well and later re-assemble at will, with minimal losses of efficiency in either form - we don't do that because we're awesome, but because unlike the US we can't maintain several full scale units at once engaged in combat remotely in another continent like that long term, it's much cheaper to do it our way but it needs proper training and tactics).

Then to avoid our own afghanistan (we're already dealing with the real one) we made a deal with the touaregs to force mali's gov to work with them and allow them some autonomy, if they stopped helping the islamists dickheads and helped secure the cities against them instead.

Then we made a second mission with the other african nations there to make sure it was not a ""France thing"", to ensure they can work on their own security, and of course Chad joined in because their army just follows us ever since we were there when they needed it.

It's basically a joke in French that there are more people who loved président Hollande in Mali than there was in France.

All of that to say: if France did not get involved there back then, it's not a maybe that we would have had ISIS 2 in northern Mali.

2138,"&gt; 4. All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.

According to you, this is the law that Turkey has broken. But you are in fact mistaken. 

&gt; territorial integrity or political independence of any state

The YPG, who Turkey's operation targets, does not have any state in Syria. The YPG are a non-state factor, who, until their deal with Assad after the operation, were occupying land in Syria *illegally*. You can throw Article 2 straight out the window. Attacking a state was never the goal of this operation. 

And meanwhile, I advise you take a look at Article 51: 

&gt; Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security. Measures taken by Members in the exercise of this right of self-defence shall be immediately reported to the Security Council and shall not in any way affect the authority and responsibility of the Security Council under the present Charter to take at any time such action as it deems necessary in order to maintain or restore international peace and security

The YPG, who has been proven to have several affiliations with the PKK in the past, is a threat to Turkey's national security. Considering that the UN has not yet taken any measures to come to a peaceful resolution, it is 100% within Turkey's right to launch an attack in order to secure her borders.",Turkey,/r/europe/comments/e20p28/exclusive_turkey_holds_up_nato_military_plans/f8vvee5/,ozan0053,1574878021

If so, this permits the EU to erect NTBs between the UK and third-party trade partners.  (Obviously, the US objects to this, as the US is such a third party.  *cough* Factory-farmed US chicken.)

My guess is that this is not likely to be a winnable fight for the EU.  If the UK were going to agree to terms that would permit the EU to establish [NTBs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-tariff_barriers_to_trade) between the UK and third parties, there'd be little sense in the UK not taking European Union Customs Union membership and permitting the EU to set *tariff* barriers, and it would avoid a lot of trade hassle with the EU.

Not true. I remember the days that Turkey told EU to put PKK on the terrorist list, but EU didn't give a jack and Turkey was powerless at the time.

PKK has never been removed from the terror list. That list is updated every six months. You are probably referring to 2008. There was technical/procedural errors made when puttin PKK on the list. Those technical errors are gone. Go check the current terrorist list to see PKK on it.

By now most Germans could not care less about Poland (that was different 20 years ago). Poles insist on living in the past instead of looking forard to the future, contrary to the way France and Germany made their friendship happen after WW2, where both just said ""ok guys, the past is the past, shit happens, lets forget about it"". 

Poles always think that somehow the world owes them. That they do not have to make an effort on their very own side to improve relations, that only ever the other side should move. They ask for reperations despite getting a huge amount of land (not even by their own doing, but given by the Soviets) and that more then 70 years after the event. On the other hand there is nothing Poland can offer to make a friendship worthwhile. They just take, never give. The refugee question was another such example, couple thousands refugees to help out southern Europe in their plight was already too much while german tax payers finance huge projects in Poland (which the Poles then try to bend as if Poland does Germany a favor by accepting the money.

Then came Yalta and as the news travelled back on the agreement the moral obviously went down as they realised that home was probably not an option anymore.

2446,"Translation from the interview (captions are not exactly on point):

Professor: In the era of Trump the right is very radical and the left is radical. Universities in America (refers to US) are usually left leaning. Columbia is some kind of socialist left heading towards communism, it is a new type of communism. 

Moderator:  I think you're exaggerating but anyway...

Professor: I'm not exaggerating

Moderator:  It's about political correctness pushed to absurdity.

Professor: The political correctness reached the level of a diseases, it is the jaundice of America. 

Profesor: We, the teachers of acting school of which I was the director, were summoned and we were told that we have to create a committee that hires a new professor because one of us retired and we had a free spot.

Moderator: How many were you?

Professor:  We were 5 or 6, and the dean of Art school told us that we were too many white professors, too many heterosexual male professors and it is required to hire a new professor, preferably a black woman, and if she is gay it's very good, but if it's a man it would be very good for him to be Puerto Rican or black, and of course, it can't be someone like you Andrei, because you're man who's been married and you are heterosexual and have children.

Moderator: It's not a joke?

Professor: It's not a joke. And then I asked: What if the best, most skilled to be a professor and teach the students which spend a lot of money on this tuition, candidate is a white male who has a family and is married?

Moderator: And?

Professor: And they told me ""no, you cannot hire this candidate"".

Moderator: Did you have someone in mind or you were just having a principle discussion? 

Professor: I was just have a principle discussion,  after which it turned out that someone who was  very qualified was not hired, and they hired someone else who was a black gay person.

Moderator: And that was the point in which you decided to quit? 

Professor: No, this was a point  in which I felt they took  a decision that is against my principles and that I am unfair because I am the head of this committee. I felt that I had to accept something because I was told to so, because they order it. I felt like I'm in communism again.

Professor: The second time was when we had an audition for new students, audition for which students come from all over the world not just from California on fixed amount of spots. \[...\]

Professor: Anyway, in an audition, a transsexual, a boy who decided to be a she, came, and I asked him ""What did you prepare for this audition?"" and she says ""I prepared Juliet's monologue"" 

Professor: \[explaining what Juliet's monologue is\] I don't believe that a boy that decided now to be a girl can be the 14 years old pure girl that was Juliet. He could have tried other scenes from other plays and I ask him ""do you have anything else but Juliet?"" ""No, does it bother you?"" he answered,  I said, I'm not irritated but I don't know how you could make me believe you are Juliet. ""Can I start the monologue?"" he asked. ""Yes, obviously"", he tried it, and after he finished the rest of the committee started blaming me for not being able to believe he isn't Juliet, ""Because I can't believe that"", I said, ""I don't believe he can play Juliet and I can't believe that if he is accepted as a student at Columbia, I wouldn't be able to work with this boy who became a girl 3 years ago, as Juliet. I can't, I cannot be dishonest to myself"". I sent my resignation letter and I left.

This issue is magnified by the fact that meat processing plants have huge control over the price of beef here.

The protests were acting under a large single campaign but that seems to be splitting into smaller factions now.

There are lots of little things that have gotten the protest to this point here. This link about yesterday and today's protests in general.

Yeah ok.

Because the conditions agreed upon in 2015 aren‘t met.

Because Turkey has little to offer other than its geographic location. This won‘t change anytime soon.

#[Trump fans are much angrier about housing assistance when they see an image of a black man](https://www.vox.com/identities/2017/9/8/16270040/trump-clinton-supporters-racist)

&gt;In contrast, Clinton supporters seemed relatively unmoved by racial cues.

#[Do white people want merit-based admissions policies? Depends on who their competition is.](https://www.vox.com/2016/5/22/11704756/affirmative-action-merit)

&gt;white applicants were three times more likely to be admitted to selective schools than Asian applicants with the exact same academic record.

&gt;the degree to which white people emphasized merit for college admissions changed depending on the racial minority group, and whether they believed test scores alone would still give them an upper hand against a particular racial minority.

&gt;As a result, the study suggests that the emphasis on merit has less to do with people of color's abilities and more to do with how white people strategically manage threats to their position of power from nonwhite groups.

2996,"&gt; Emergency landings of airplanes are a realistic scenario and have happened many times before.

And for this reason every flight starts with emergency instructions demonstration. So why make a separate video about it?

&gt; Terrorist attacks with bombs and automatic guns in Poland are fear mongering and have no base in reality and no other purpose than scaring people in following the ruling party and its divisive rhetoric.

Here are some reasons for making this video one could think of:
* Polish people travel abroad where terrorist attacks do happen.
* Poland slowly opens its borders for workers from different parts of the world.
* One can never be sure what future brings.
* Better safe than sorry.

&gt; The situation depicted in this piece has nothing to do with real life, and if you believe otherwise, then you have already fallen for their propaganda. Life in Europe has never in our. history been safer than it is now.

I don't know if there exist people who are awful to animals, who are not also awful to humans.  People want to believe that humans are special, but to the right (wrong) kind of mind, animals and people are all just participants in a complex scenario, reduced to entities defined by their capabilities.  The capabilities of an animal are so much less than the capabilities of a human, especially the social capabilities.  An animal has a hard time reporting on its needs to others.  It cannot report a crime committed against it the way a human can.

I can only claim to be speculating; I do not know some full psychology of this issue.  Yet I suspect that if people hurt animals who cannot report crimes committed against them, they will also hurt humans who cannot report crimes committed against them.

All of that said...  It's hard to imagine what kind of surveillance apparatus would not have poor access to evidence around animal abuse.

3277,"That rhetoric is often just politicians trying to impress their voters *which you should be familiar with as well :-)*.     

The intention is that EU countries keep their debt at 60%(?) of GDP for a stable and healthy foundation.     

Some years ago Greece (and Portugal, Spain, Ireland) had serious financial issues needing a massive bailout from the European Bank (Germany paid a lot of that), but they only could get that money after those countries made some painful adjustments to their internal financial affairs (which they did).     

The thought was that those 'examples' would suffice for the other countries to get their affairs in order, and 'the EU' made it perfectly clear that such a bailout would not be repeated, but despite of that a year ago Italy's Salvini almost started a 'war' with the EU by promising higher pensions starting at a lower age, while also promising lower taxes (it did get him elected, and he only backed off because the EU would throw him under the bus).     
France isn't a very good bookkeeper either, see [list](https://www.statista.com/statistics/269684/national-debt-in-eu-countries-in-relation-to-gross-domestic-product-gdp/), and I get the impression that *(cnbc.com)* does not look at facts but only listens to the loudest ""Gib Monies"" (or whatever Trump's propaganda team uses as yardstick).      

On top of that, IF France/Italy want to improve themselves then they not only should start collecting 'all' taxes and not start paying pensions at age 55, they should also invest in upgrading their own industrial sector (efficiency) or branch out (start-ups) and such, the European Bank even has negative interest rates at the moment (you need to pay to have money in your savings account), something I'm missing from (cnbc.com)'s article.",Flevoland,/r/europe/comments/e1yawp/europe_could_rev_up_the_world_economy/f8taqg0/,mrCloggy,1574799457

Eastern Europe was extremely multi-ethnic, everyone had their own language. But if there's one thing that I know then it's that many of us speak a lot of languages. Heck, I know Jews who speak Polish never having lived there because their parents kept it alive. But sure, we never learnt the languages of our host nation, except for when we did and participated in politics. Which was it actually?  
   
Why do you assert this view as if all Jews collectively huzza'ed when the soviets came rolling in? The largest Jewish political party was staunchly anti-leninist and Russians had been for quite some time the worst rulers around qua their policies. You really paint us as this anti-Polish group of people whereas the only negative sentiment I ever hear about Poles is thát they're antisemitic. And painting us as a monolith that hates Poland is so fucking strong if you'd only know half of the history of our persecution. Heck despite everything that happened in the 20th century Poland still expelled its remaining Jews in 1968.

I don't get your point. The world did not get safer by nuclear arms was what I was trying to say. Any speculations about deaths of a 'WWIII' aren't really interesting due to the fact that most probably the world will get nuked in large parts and most of humanity will die.

&gt;And nuclear scientists aren't the experts on how close the world is to nuclear war. 

Can you name anyone more entitled? I haven't really heard anyone scientifically important distrusting them or their score, but I'm curious for your arguments!

&gt;Only hold as much weight as the people who signed the treaties let them have. 

Yes. And still it was due to treaties that made the de-nuclearization of the UdSSR and the USA begin (until the US withdrew) or made it possible to supervise Iran's nuclear activities (until the US withdrew). Of course in every treaty lies the possibility of betrayal, which I guess most of us have experienced the one way or the other in everyday life.

Rebuild the main train station.

Expand tram lines to high usage centers outside the city (office parks, uni campuses).

Tunnel underneath the city to alleviate traffic on the ring roads.

Rebuild the regional bus terminal.

Deploy a zoning system for parking in the historical centre, bringing in huge amounts of money for the city for decades to come.

Expand the Geothermal District heating system to more neighborhoods in the city, easing reliance on natural gas for heating and hot water.

But I digress. I just wanted to point out that France is the second biggest spender in NATO, and probably the only NATO nation outside the US with force projection capabilities, and that not meeting the 2% threshold is due to accounting rather than lack of commitment to the Alliance spending goals.

Btw I don't think that a European army will solve the main problem in the Alliance: the fact that apart from the US, France, Poland and the UK, everybody underspends and this makes the alliance overly reliant on the US. The bet that leaving NATO would act as a wake up call to Germany, Spain, Italy, Benelux and the rest of Europe is a very risky bet and we could be left without anything to defend us.

-Russia will be less dependant of china, a huge benefit on the global scene 
-Russia will have less interest to threaten Eastern Europeans countries as it could have much more repercussions (this last point is subject to speculations honestly)

● Text that was published after the thesis – meaning other authors might have

3801,"&gt; Any ideas to this? My main point is that absolute illegalzation of drugs is really countereffective to the actual reason that it's illegal, but absolute llegalization in a sort of laissez-faire-politic would end in it imploding on itself.

So, my biggest fear with drugs is societal. To live in a society like that of China during the Opium Wars, where a significant population is slave to their addictive habit. I believe is unethical and that without government intervention this is possible in any country in the world. Nowadays we consider addiction a disease, so people get health treatment. Well, as most doctors will tell you prevention is preferable to treatment, that why we also vaccinate our kids.

To so this, I don't think we should completely legalize (with the exception of weed, which I consider to be in the category of alcohol and cigarettes), because I don't think it would work based on the inelastic economics of addictive drugs, plus I find it unethical as a government to allow substances that are very addictive and unhealthy, after all it's a governments responsibility to protect its citizens even if the citizens make dumb choices (e.g. to a lesser extent eating excessive fast food), and mind you we/the EU, have banned or regulated less harmful substances for much less than that.

Besides ethics the thing with drugs is the economics. If we legalize, weird things will happen, because drugs are considered inelastic (aka not effected by price). Cartels will get less money, but will it be enough to put them out of business? Or will usage go up or down? Dunno. Also, will we see a new sort of crime where we buy drugs cheap in ""legal"" NL and resale for large premium in other EU countries?

However, that said drug use should 1) not be criminalized, and 2) drug use should actively be discouraged, 3) and drug dealing should be actively policed. In the Netherlands, we do 1, we used to do 2 because our grandparents were from a generation that practically didn't use drugs ever, and 3 was never an issue.

3827,"Because anti-semitism refers to a particular phenomenon in its historical context. The term was coined to refer to Jews in the context of 'scientific' anti-Judaism. As such it is a phenomenon distinct from general hatred of Other. Besides while antisemitism and islamophobia have their intersections (in particular in far-right discourse as is to be expected) there is no generalized singular hatred that covers both groups (but not others than them, which is just run of the mill racism). Why do you object to this?  


I seriously dislike aipac but so do most Jews. That's why we don't have a pope, no one person gets to claim an authoritative position from which he or she represents all Jews.   


Which brings us to the evergreen accusation of double loyalties. As a Pole you live in a Catholic nation. Much can be said that there exists a double loyalty between the church and the Polish nation, yet of course most would immediately know this is not necessarily the case. The same is true for me and Jews in general.

For example, if we acknowledge the astronomical amount of wealth extracted from India in our 300 or so years there, the damage done to the country's development, then we can see that empire lives on today in various struggles that continue on the subcontinent.

The various European empires established dominance in parts of the world that heavily influenced subsequent trade deals signed as empires withdrew. What should we do about global trade built on colonial coercion?

Even today, vast amounts of money flow from 'the global South' to 'the global North' (hate those terms, sorry, but you know what I mean). More than enters poor parts of the world in aid money. That is to say ---  **wealth extraction that began in the colonial era continue today in more or less the same direction as it always did.**

I believe everyone is racist. I believe this is a human thing. Black people are also racist towards white people in Africa. [Example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GslPzhFLyas). But i also believe that it can be learned not to be this way. With proper exposure.

In Eastern Europe because there are very few black people there was very little exposure, so even racism towards black people is pretty rare. People look odd at black people because they are not used to but i don't believe i've ever seen or heard anyone mistreating them in any way. They don't have a reason to. We never heard on the news that black people are doing bad shit. So there is no reason to be racist towards them.

Gypsies on the other hand, they are constantly mistreated, because most of the exposure we had with gypsies was bad, terrible or worse.

Just today on /r/Romania we had [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Romania/comments/e1i9v1/crima_%C3%AEnfior%C4%83toare_s%C4%83v%C3%A2r%C5%9Fit%C4%83_de_membrii_unui_clan/) piece of news. 3 Gypsies killed a man in Braila because he asked them to piss somewhere else.

You seem to believe that people in EE are racist just because. But they are racist because that was their exposure to gypsies.

Same goes for Black People in other countries. For example take a look at this [documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLxhutdnFNU) which was made by the former leader for Commission for Racial Equality. 

Check out [14:30](https://youtu.be/tLxhutdnFNU?t=861). Romanians in the UK are the biggest group of pickpocketers. When you see what Romanians went to England, mostly are uneducated or gypsies. And yet they gave every Romanian a bad rep. When I go to WE it's sometimes awkward to say i'm Romanian because of the reputation my poorer countrymen gained.

This particular scene is juxtaposed with the rainbow pride flag, which happened to be flown in solidarity with the victims of the Orlando nightclub shooting. When I saw this and remembered the original photograph from a textbook in my studies, I hastily had it printed out and returned to the scene.

3975,"&gt; Because of whataboutist idiots who hate women more than they actually worry about the plight of other men. 

I completely understand this, don't get me wrong. I'm not advocating for a ""Domestic Abuse against Men"" day or something to that regard. A general awareness campaign focussing on both genders makes much more sense. You can draw all kinds of wrong conclusions if you only study 50% of the population and 60% of the victims. That's the kind of cherry picking of data and plain bias I got taught to avoid, not promote.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; If there's an awareness campaign about anything in the Netherlands **exclusively about the Dutch issues**, should foreigners force themselves into the discussion and start blabbing about how **other countries share the problem** as well? 

You are contradicting yourself a little there so I don't know how to answer that question. If it's an awareness campaign in the Netherlands **exclusively** about Dutch issues, then people from different countries don't share the same problem because that's what the word ""exclusive"" means. Without that specific word, I'd say of course they can have a voice if they are affected by the same problems. 

I don't really understand what you're trying to say. Are you trying to make a comparison with the topic of this AMA? Domestic abuse isn't exclusive to either men or women, it's an issue everyone deals with. Hence why excluding half the population based on gender is not an ideal way to tackle or raise awareness of this problem.",The Netherlands,/r/europe/comments/e1h84h/hello_reddit_im_lauren_chadwick_a_journalist_at/f8rtcru/,SLimmerick,1574752251

 Or try to download Gastromapa - it will give you only the best tips for a coffee shops, bars, bistro, restaurants etc.

 If you are a beer person - visit Plzeň, I live here (can give you a tour through this city) mainly for the legendary Pilsner beer. 

 If you like wine... well, you can try some wine around Brno, yet my friends are saying it is not good at all.

Because you guys don't stop beating a dead horse with the red hearing/whataboutism.

If a topic focuses on how women suffer/are discriminated against people like you bring the ""but what about men, we suffer too!"".

It's also exasperating seeing this reaction and behavior especially when it's a legitimized, proven, researched issue that touches a group (here women) not only more than men when it comes to numbers but also by the nature of it too: ""because they are women"" and many of you are not open minded enough to understand **why** it is such.

Obviously it's a human nature issue. But you don't touch the human nature part before fixing the gender/patriarchal part first, which is a bigger issue.

[This](https://www.academia.edu/2267614/Muinas-Tartu._Uurimus_Tartu_muinaslinnuse_ja_asula_asustusloost._Summary_Prehistoric_Tartu_A_Study_of_the_Settlement_History_of_the_Tartu_Prehistoric_Hillfort_and_Settlement) is the most complete overview of the archaeological findings from the area that I could find. 

The section on page 169-173 talks about the dating of the finds, of particular interest might be the graphs on page 170 - the left one concerns the fortress, and the right one concering the surrounding settlement. 

As can be seen the frequency of finds spikes up sharply around 1030, then drops down again in 1060. Which lines up with the recorded founding of Yuryev and it being razed.

There is another spike in the early 13th century for the fortress, but there is no such spike for the settlement. 

In general the volume of findings is low, which makes it unlikely that the settlement/fortress was continuously inhabited during the entire 1030-1224 period.

As for evidence of inhabitation prior to 1030, there is some, but the settlement was likely small (not a ""city"" of any import), and abandoned before the 11th century.

I don't think we know for sure what it was called. The fortress and surrounding region were named as Tarbatu in the 13th century chronicle, but that does not mean it necessarily bore the same name several hundred years prior and there is no written record prior to 1030.",Estonia,/r/europe/comments/e1cepb/the_medieval_topography_of_tartu_estonia/f8rf6uc/,EestiGang,1574738873

4277,"&gt;True but this time both sides have equal power instead of one of them having that power while other doesn't.

Great, now if my home is invaded, if I catch the criminal instead of having a 95% chance of the him escaping and 5% of him doing something to me (and also since he will most likely not have a gun himself I can still fight back) I have like a  50% chance of having a lethal gunfight. Sounds like a triumph to me!
And you don't need to have a gun to protect yourself from rape, there's pepper spray and similars for that, unless they do it in group in which case having a gun would have been equally useless. Not to mention that if someone is in the 3-5 meters range the gun is completely useless unless already cocked and prepared, so you would still be better off with a knife or spray. 

If someone pulls a gun on you you're screwed regardless if you have your own gun, it's who draws first, if nobody has a gun at least you have a chance to run away.

&gt;ome is not all. Dealing with 10k people who have guns is quite different than 4mln people with guns.

It wouldn't have mattered one bit. *Not one bit*. Even if every jew held a gun, the Nazis would have still demanded them to hand them over, and most of them would have done it because they were convinced it wasn't going to get THAT bad, just like the few who had them did. And if they tried to rebel they would have failed spectacularly since they weren't united by anything other than being Jews, they weren't willing to fight against a society that until the last moments they felt was still their own, and most importantly they would have just helped the cause of the Nazis by consolidating the public opinion against them even more than it already was at the time, thus allowing the Nazi police and army to crush them instantly since they knew each one of them due to meticolous registration.
There's no way, absolutely no way in hell that the Jews owning weapons would have been of any significant help to resist against the Nazis.

&gt;You don't know much about how to occupy place. You can't do that when everyone has a gun. Winning some battles is the easiest part of invasion, keeping it occupied is complete hell in that case.

Oh, but you can. That 100% of the population owns weapons means nothing when 95% of that population isn't willing to fight for its freedom. What you'll get is an initial response that will stop very soon once the occupants start to do revenge killings on the population. The vast majority of people aren't willing to risk their lives to repel an invasor, not to mention that with modern technology there are ways to monitor your population that basically make succeeding in any significant uprising from extremely unlikely to impossible, and the professional soldiers will have a field day making short work of the majority of weapon users who don't have the slightest clue about guerrilla tactics.

Basically the only advantage you have is that the 5% of the population that was gonna fight the invaders with or without guns just gets more access to guns, instead of needing to steal them or get them from foreign powers.

So in order to be *slightly* more protected in case of a foreign invasion, which is in and of itself extremely unlikely seeing as the EU has nuclear strike capabilities, I should elect to be at a much higher risk of getting shot in my day to day life?

4298,"&gt; So, it seems that Bosniaks, alongside Croats waited to see who would win the war, and then, joined the forces. 

Not necessarily - I dont know much about the Bosniak case but the Croat population was rather divided during WWII, and the idea of them sitting idly on their asses is an exaggeration. Of course you had the fanatics which joined the Ustashe, who (for the most part) remained true to their ideology to the end. You had those who joined the Partisans from the offset, and likewise you had the bulk who were either indifferent and with no real reason (at least not initially) to take up arms against the new establishment. Having said that, it most certainly varied from region to region also (eg. Dalmatia which was given away to Italy). 

The tide of the war turning was a factor, though you already had skepticism and distrust towards the Ustashe regime, especially from the Domobranstvo. However, as the balance of power changed, this no doubt served as the catalyst to take more concrete action.

Having said all that, the Chetniks literally did what youve described, opportunistically jumping from side to side over the course of the war.

&gt; They all to happily claim their part in liberation of Yugoslavia but always forgetting to mention that the Serbs took the brunt of that war

Well they rightly can claim their part, as with any other nation which contributed. I dont think any rationale person would doubt that Serbs bore the brunt, but as I mentioned previously, the initial reasons for whether to/not to take up arms varied amongst the different groups and by region.

&gt; and that many of those who survived WWII was expelled from places they were born and controlled by Bosniaks and Croats today

Because you seem to think she was just some immigrant that happened to born in Poland and Poles want credit just because she was born there, but you don't realize how much being Polish was part of her life, she was a Polish nationalist.

Her parents lost land for supporting the Uprisings against Russia, her farther was a Math and Physics teacher, when the Russians shut him down too, he brought home his lab equipment and thought her how to use it. After completing gymnasium she went to the Flying University, a patriotic institution. She was supposed to marry some decently accomplished Polish Mathematician but he was too poor.  When she went to France she wanted to return to Poland and Pierre was willing to move with her and be a French teacher. They only stayed in France because she was not accepted in the Krakow academy, so for convenience, not for ""beginning to feel French"" or whatever immigrants would tell you these days. Despite this she thought her children Polish and continued to travel to Poland with them. She still used her polish surname Sklodowska and her Nobel prize was given in both. 

&gt;It would be ungrateful, insulting to her husband's memory and to Becquerel's work as well as a big flip off to my country's hospitality that I would lose, instantly,

And you don't think, that its insulting to both \*her memory\* ,that the world remembers her as Marie Curie even though she never lost her Polish identity and purposefully used both surnames? And Poland for creating such an individual? I know France provided her with the resources for her discovery but most of the work was done is a small shed outside of the school not an actual lab, she was rejected from Krakow academy because of Austrian law and even before she moved to France she was already and intelligent and strong women, and that was Poland's doing.

Yea, it's almost a suffix, but unlike proper suffixes, it doesn't follow vowel harmony. Estonian has lost vowel harmony, but Finnish still has it. So the same suffix is different based on the vowels of the word. Like ""kaksi-ko"" meaning a question ""two"". But if the word has a front vowel like y, the suffix is -kö. ""yksi-kö"".

Kaa in Finnish doesn't follow this. We say yhdenkaa instead of yhdenkää, which is how a proper suffix would do it.

4536,"Translation

The fiasco of the independence process and the electoral collapse of Citizens in the last general elections have reactivated the strategy of the PSC to place itself in the political centrality of Catalonia.  The Catalan Socialists will hold their 14th congress from December 12 to 15 in Barcelona to print a change to their speech and attract the constitutionalist voter who in the last Catalan elections of 2017 raised Inés Arrimadas to victory and who now can feel orphaned.

""The spectrum of the two communities must be definitively moved away,"" says the framework paper that will be discussed at the congress to refute the effects generated by the process.  “It is time for the languages, the school, the Diada and the senyera to become everyone's again”, adds the document, in which a new linguistic pact is claimed, without considering Catalan the vehicular language in the school or defending the  Linguistic immersion that has been applied for more than three decades.  At the same time, they also request a new model of public media to make TV3 the plural television that has not been in recent times, according to the Socialists.

 At the same time, the PSC defends, as it has been doing since its foundation, in 1978, that Catalonia is a ""nation"" that must be recognized and that Spain is a plurinational state in which the most appropriate form of territorial organization is federalism  .  ""The PSC has more than 40 years of history and has always defended that Catalonia is a nation,"" said this morning the secretary of Organization of the party, Salvador Illa, who has been surprised ""because this is news.""

 ""We want a Catalonia capable of forging its future as a nation, thus guaranteeing the continuity of its language and culture and with full respect for the languages ​​spoken in the territory in a federative and plurinational relationship with Spain,"" said the Socialists in the resolution adopted  at its 2016 congress.

 The following year, the executives of the PSOE and the PSC signed the so-called Declaration of Barcelona in which it says: ""For the Socialists, a process of strengthening the self-government of Catalonia, of improving its financing, of  better recognition of his national personality and his driving role of the whole of Spain "".  And he continues: ""As we formulated in July 2013 in the Declaration of Granada, we are convinced that the definitive solution to the current disagreement will go through a constitutional reform that makes Spain a federal state. In this way, it is necessary to move forward until fully recognizing its  plurinational character "".

 Catalan Socialists believe that the broken or ""severely damaged"" pacts (particularly languages ​​and education), which have built their national cohesion since the Transition, have to be remade.  The framework paper defends that ""they will have to be forged again because the desire for unilateral appropriation of their central elements by the independence movement has caused their abandonment by a very relevant number of citizens of Catalonia.""

 These are some of the main proposals of the document that the congress will discuss.

 Recognition of Catalonia as a nation.  Catalan Socialists consider that Catalonia and Spain ""are plural and diverse, a group of peoples with their own uniqueness with social, cultural and political ties that have held them together.""  Therefore, the PSC understands that ""recognizing Catalonia as a nation and Spain as a plurinational State"" is the way to understand their ""union and equality in diversity"".

 Dialogue, negotiation and agreement.  The document is committed to these three steps to solve the fit of Catalonia in Spain and to ensure ""more levels of self-government, starting with the improvement of funding and political recognition for Catalonia.""  The first step would be an agreement between Catalans, with the reform of the Statute of Autonomy defended by the PSC although it is not explicitly stated in the document, and then the constitutional reform.

 Bet on federal Spain.  The PSC summarizes this idea in four points.  Change the current rules to otherwise distribute the competencies of the autonomous communities;  change resources with a new financing model for Administrations;  change the representation model, making the Senate a Chamber of territorial representation and recognizing the ""national plurality"" of Spain.  “The main lines of the agreement have to go through more Catalonia in Spain and more Spain in Catalonia,” says the text.  ""Federal Spain would allow it to increase co-government and responsibility on the part of the autonomous communities and visualize their multiculturalism and, at the same time, facilitate the involvement of Spanish institutions in the future of Catalonia"", recognizing the capital of Barcelona and infrastructure  They don't exist now.

 A flexible linguistic model.  The PSC considers that the pact of coexistence prevailing in Catalonia since the restoration of democracy “has been broken by the instrumentalization made by the nationalisms of the language, by the independence process, which has associated Catalan with its cause, and by a  partisan use around its use, especially at school ”.  Given this fact and the ""current risk of the mother tongue becoming a factor of social division in the school"", Catalan socialists intend to achieve ""an effective and emotional coexistence of Catalan and Spanish.""  For this they propose a multilingual educational model, ""with the flexibility that the sociolinguistic reality present in our country demands"" and ensure knowledge of the two languages.  At the same time, the PSC is committed to the recognition and preservation of multilingualism in Spain, ""articulating the defense of all official languages"" in order to ensure that all citizens can speak their language and the Administrations guarantee them that right.

 A new TV3.  The framework paper considers that so many years of nationalism in Catalonia, as well as the independence process, have caused a division in Catalan society and an unprecedented crisis that has been aggravated by “victimhood through the misrepresentation of history” and  the situation of Catalonia with respect to other territories for several reasons: the partisan use of institutions, the lack of impartiality and neutrality of the public media and ""the political instrumentalization of feelings and emotions"".  A part of the programming of TV3 and Catalunya Ràdio have turned them into ""instruments of agitation and propaganda"" at the service of independence.  To combat this situation, the PSC asks to “reconfigure” the radio and television that depend on the Generalitat so that they are “at the service of all and recover their credibility”, so that they are “the rapporteurs of diversity and plurality, neutral  regarding the different political options ”.  The consensus allowed the creation of the Catalan Audiovisual Media Corporation, but now a new law is needed, so that the addresses of TV3 and Catalunya Ràdio are designated with an international competition.",Spain,/r/europe/comments/e1k38a/the_psc_reaffirms_that_catalonia_is_recognized_as/f8pr4mh/,Matrim_WoT,1574705975

Of course. German-Diesel-spokesperson Sinn.

And shortly thereafter, data published by VW confirmed that its e-Rabbit vehicle emits slightly more CO2 than its Rabbit Diesel within the German energy mix. (When based on the overall European energy mix, which includes a huge share of nuclear energy from France, the e-Rabbit fares slightly better than the Rabbit Diesel.)
&gt; 
&gt; Adding further evidence, the Austrian thinktank Joanneum Research has just published a large-scale study commissioned by the Austrian automobile association, ÖAMTC, and its German counterpart, ADAC, that also confirms those findings.

4652,"&gt; One of the major topics currently in Slovak media is how to ensure hungarian participation in next parliament since thanks to infighting between two main hungarian parties (Most-Hid and SMK-MKP) its very likely that none of the two will pass the necessary 5% tresh-hold for entry to parliament.

I think that it won't be good that there (likely) won't be a Hungarian party in the next parliament, but honestly, they deserve that. Bugar is a spineless idiot and SMK with the Orban influence is even worse. However, I am worried that their absence in the parliament will lead to unrest and radicalization among the minority.

&gt; Btw Most-Hid and SMK were close to achieving coalition for next elex, but then FIDESZ which de facto controls SMK intervenes and vetoed it.

I am from Russia. And I guess Russia makes everything for the EU. Even with Crimea. 

It seems to be an anti-European move. But in fact, it is a 100% pro European move. 

With Crimea annexation, Putin destroyed any capability to build the Russian empire (USSR style). After Crimea Russia cant control Ukraine with diplomacy. This is literally impossible. And moreover, Russia cant conquer Ukraine with the army. This is impossible too.

Without Ukraine, Russia can't build an empire. Putin pushed Ukraine to the EU and blocked Ukraine's way to NATO. This is a 100% pro-European move.

&gt;(b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;

We disagree over participation of other actors. This is a key statement 

&gt;The Congo Free State operated as a corporate state privately controlled by Leopold II, although he never personally visited the state.

It was a corporation, multinational corporation with Leopold as CEO and a frontman. 

&gt;In 1876 Leopold II of Belgium hosted a geographic conference in Brussels, inviting famous explorers, philanthropists, and members of geographic societies to stir up interest in a ""humanitarian"" endeavor for Europeans to take in central Africa to ""improve"" and ""civilize"" the lives of the indigenous peoples.[13] At the conference, Leopold organized the International African Association with the cooperation of European and American explorers and the support of several European governments, and was himself elected chairman. Leopold used the association to promote plans to seize independent central Africa under this philanthropic guise.

And this

&gt;Leopold began to create a plan to convince other European powers of the legitimacy of his claim to the region, all the while maintaining the guise that his work was for the benefit of the native peoples under the name of a philanthropic ""association"".

...

&gt;The king launched a publicity campaign in Britain to distract critics, drawing attention to Portugal's record of slavery, and offering to drive slave traders from the Congo basin. He also secretly told British merchant houses that if he was given formal control of the Congo for this and other humanitarian purposes, he would then give them the same most favored nation (MFN) status Portugal had offered them. At the same time, Leopold promised Bismarck he would not give any one nation special status, and that German traders would be as welcome as any other.",ER,/r/europe/comments/e0kdhu/belgium_begins_to_face_brutal_colonial_legacy_of/f8o5u3o/,InatticaJacoPet,1574664073

Spain and Finland were very poor countries before WWII. You can for sure find even poorer countries, but in the region of Central Europe, Poland was certainly poorest. And that simply led to weaker starting position after the war. Agricultural policies then made things even worst making Poland lack behind Eastern Germany, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and even Soviet Union, Especially it's western Republics like Latvia, Ukraine and Belarus.

I am not saying that there was no progress in Poland, but it was slower and Poland was experiencing constant economic problems all through Socialist period because it could not manage to industrialize it's economy.

that is just shortsighted. Famines happened throughout human history, because of crop failures and war.

Romania didn't have starvation a few decades before communism, or 3 decades after communism ended, but did have a severe famine right as communism started and food shortages in the 80s. All glory to communism https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_famine_of_1946%E2%80%9347#In_Moldova

You serve no one but your country’s interests. And you neither need nor deserve our thanks. Die for your country all you like, but don’t dare presume you’re doing it on our behalf as well.

“Then why does Europe not kick us out or at least stop asking us to stay?”

Europe doesn’t ask you to stay. Some eastern EU members do, due to their fear of Russia. The rest just want clarity - will you, or will you not be useful to us. Under Obama, you started being much less useful, and under Trump you’re becoming quite detrimental to our safety.

Which brings me to your comment on Macron - you seem to think he wants you to stay - he doesn’t. He’d much rather the US left, hence his latest controversial interview.

The rest of the political class (in Germany, for example) simply like the status quo, and the US doesn’t want to leave, which makes it difficult to remove them. It is a convenient passive state that politicians don’t like to disturb (which is also why I think Macron’s statements are both brave and neccessary), as it would likely cost them internally.

“Either theres a reason the US is still here, which I assure there is, or your governments are corrupt and cant help but love that sweet dollar.”

Yes, I stated the reason - the US needs Europe to be it’s base of operations. And no, it cannot be viably replaced by other locations as points of entry to Africa and Asia, as you presume. No other place has the neccessary technological, economical and infrastructural base, while located so ideally and while having such positive and friendly relations with the US. And, not to forget, while being so safe from external threats to US assets.

2002 was when Germany decided to phase out nuclear. The first nuclear plant shut down one year later.

5406,"&gt; That’s because raising birthrates is something contrary to human choice.

I'm not so sure. I think the modern welfare state actively discourages having kids, by setting up the incentives the wrong way. Economically, children should be an asset, because a society that doesn't have kids will eventually do very bad economically as well (let's assume negligible immigration).

An example policy would be to get old people to receive a pension that's a percentage of the tax their kids pay. Say, 50% of the tax the kids pay to the state goes to the parents instead. So if you have 2 kids making $2000 each, and they pay 40% tax, you get 20% of $4000, so $800. This encourages people to have babies, and also encourages them to make sure they're well educated and get good jobs.

But then you'd need to stomach making people with no kids live in poverty in old age, which is almost impossible politically, especially in very leftist countries like Europe has.

You would also need a propaganda machine that shows kids like the coolest thing ever.",,/r/europe/comments/e03gon/tackling_demographic_issues_crucial_for_eus/f8n9dxh/,bossdebossnr1,1574640715

5409,"&gt; Manama (AFP) - French Defence Minister Florence Parly took aim Saturday at ""gradual US disengagement"" in the Middle East and said its failure to respond to provocations blamed on Iran set off a dangerous chain of events.

&gt; Since May, tensions in the Gulf have increased with attacks against tankers, a US unmanned drone being downed, and strikes on key Saudi oil facilities.

&gt; Iran was blamed but denied involvement.

&gt; Despite the attacks on its Saudi ally and having one of its own drones shot down, the United States has avoided equivalent retaliation.

&gt; ""We’ve seen a deliberate gradual US disengagement,"" Parly said at the annual Manama Dialogue on regional security, adding it had been ""on the cards for a while"" but had become clearer.

&gt; ""When the mining of ships went unanswered, the drone got shot. When that in turn went unanswered, major oil facilities were bombed. Where does it stop? Where are the stabilisers?"" she asked.

&gt; ""The region is accustomed to the ebb and flow of US involvement. But this time it seemed more serious.""

&gt; Parly said the US drawback was a ""slow process"" and acknowledged that a US carrier strike group had just entered the Gulf.

&gt; ""But the trend is, I think, quite clear and thus probably irrespective of who wins the next elections.""

&gt; The US aircraft carrier strike group Abraham Lincoln sailed through the key Strait of Hormuz last week to show Washington's ""commitment"" to freedom of navigation, the Pentagon said.

&gt; It was the first time a US aircraft carrier group has passed through the strait since Iran downed a US drone in June in the same area.",,/r/europe/comments/e17g8s/france_takes_aim_at_us_inaction_in_mideast/f8n9ikm/,quixotic_cynic,1574640762

He and Lenhard Ng are the only two children in the history of the Johns Hopkins' Study of Exceptional Talent program to have achieved a score of 700 or greater on the SAT math section while just nine years old; Tao scored a 760.[13] Tao was the youngest participant to date in the International Mathematical Olympiad, first competing at the age of ten; in 1986, 1987, and 1988, he won a bronze, silver, and gold medal. He remains the youngest winner of each of the three medals in the Olympiad's history, winning the gold medal shortly after his thirteenth birthday.

I wholeheartedly agree. It could actually be a symbol of Romanians and Hungarians working together to create something positive. (I assume that delaying the Ottoman advance is seen positively by all of us.) That's why it's sad that it's used to create discord.

Hunyadi vára is one of the (if not *the*) most widely recognised remnants of Hungarian history in Transylvania. It could have been easily posted as Hunedoara (since that's its name) or the Corvin Castle (referencing history) but no, the one castle in Romania that Hungarians care about and is historically important to us was simply posted as ""Romanian Castle"".

Better than realistic alternatives. And yes, there's such a thing as the international law, which the West pretends to care about, when it's convenient. Barging into another country without a proper mandate is a no-no.

So 99% of governments in human history have been illegitimate? Doesn't make much sense.   

&gt;How is it working, so many years of war and now you also have Turkey tearing their country apart.  

Turkey has no appetite for conquest, they are bound to leave eventually. That's why the peace process is important, a political solution is required. Most of the country is recovering already.   

&gt;One difference though, US supported rebels might have, if Syrians were lucky, established democracy and some rule of law.  

Democracy? No chance of that happening, not in this region, not in this day and age. Building democracy is much, much harder than overthrowing the government and praying for the best. The society, the institutions must be ready for it, and that requires decades of incremental changes, and only then you could begin to consider a revolution. Otherwise, it'd be all for nothing.

The current president (and president-elect) Klaus Iohannis, obtained from state a house in the main square of Sibiu by using fake inheritence documents. He rented out the house for 14 years, with the last year of his possession earning him 30.000€/year. He  used the money to buy several other houses in Sibiu, which he also rented out. 

He lost the house as the justice system decided the documents he and his associates used to claim it were fake and he had to also give back the money he received in rent. [link with details (in Romanian)](https://www.riseproject.ro/iohannis-a-pierdut-casa-fabrica-de-bani-luata-de-la-stat/)

When he was first elected, when asked how he obtained his wealth, he claimed that by investing money he got from tutoring students in physics (he was a high-school teacher). Now we know he lied. When asked ""how come no other teachers got rich by tutoring students?"", his answer was ""tough luck!"" (this became a meme in Romania).

The idiot (Viorica Dăncilă) was made Prime-Minister after the mastermind and true leader of PSD (Liviu Dragnea) wanted a trustful prime-minister who would not have any original ideas. The previous two PMs were fired after they started to become more independent and did not want to follow 100% the directions of the puppeteer. 

However, after Dragnea was jailed, she found herself actually leading the party. Dragnea made sure that no other leader would actually rise in the party, so Dăncilă was the only one who actually stood a chance in the party chaos.

Disengagement? The US launched a missile strike on Syria's Shayrat Airbase after the chemical attack and launched a cyber attack and new sanctions on Iran after the drone incident.

5716,"&gt; Why was Poland’s situation so much worse then other exes Warsaw Pact countries?

Entire books have been written about this. I'll try to condense it.

1. WWII: Be Poland. Get your entire country destroyed. Start rebuilding.jpg
2. 1945-1965: Modest progress. Europe was booming everywhere.
3. 1965-1975: First cracks appear and then widen quickly. The economic model is clearly not working. ""Very stable genius"" PM decides that it is best to massively borrow money from the West to buy expensive machinery. The simple idea is that by using much more modern industrial tools, productivity will skyrocket! Problem is, if your economic incentive structure is fundamentally irrational, you could have the best tools in the world. Won't make a difference.
4. 1975-1980: Serious balance of payments issues emerge. There is no export boom but all these expensive stuff have to be rapid. Take loans to repay loans. At this stage, the ruling communist party is in complete denial about what is happening. 
5. 1980-1989: You default because you can't pay back all these loans. They were taken in foreign currencies and as the currency collapses, it makes it all that more expensive. (This is what Turkey witnessed, but on a much smaller scale, in 2018-19). Spend the rest of the decade in purgatory. The system is on life support. By the end of the decade, there are outright rationing, martial law and the shops are empty. Hyperinflation sets in.
6. 1989-2019: Embark on massive reforms. You've lost everything already so why not shoot for the stars?

&gt; Weren’t all economic decisions managed by Moscow?

Warsaw Pact countries which weren't part of the Soviet Union were ""under the influence"" of the Soviets. So these countries had a lot more independent sway, but still only within the confines of communism. If they got uppity (Hungary in 1956 or Czechia in 1968) then the tanks got sent in.

I have a childhood memory of my dad reversing my grandfathers car up the Loibl pass in very heavy snow as we were going into Slovenia to catch a flight home from Ljubljana at the end of Dec 1990 while many Slovenians were coming down the Loibl pass leaving Slovenia for Austria fearing war due to the recent Slovenian Independence referendum of Dec 23rd in which they voted to go Independent 

It was very dangerous conditions ice and heavy snow and many Slovenians were driving downhill in Yugos without any snow chains with all their worldly possessions strapped to their cars 

We were having problems of our own too:

My dad was driving my grandfathers new car and my grandfather told him it was front wheel drive so my dad put the snow chains on the front wheels but after several attempts to get up the pass and checking the manual it turns out it was rear wheel drive !! - nightmare 

We stopped to change the snow chains over (much to the amusement of the Austrian police) but the car still wouldn’t go up the hill in the heavy snow and ice so dad just ended reversing up while avoiding Yugos sliding down the pass - so thats how to make a rear wheel drive car work in heavy snow and ice with snow chains !!

5886,"I dont agree on the premise the Uk wants to be in the eu on that time.

Let's put it like this. As if it were people in a relationship.

the Uk says i want to break up, we have to think about splitting our belongings and i need a new place to live (this is the metaphor for leaving. obviously)

So the eu is sad things have come this way but it wont settle for less than its entitled to and it's also their house so the uk needs to leave not the other way around. So for a few years they discuss who gets what and the Uk needs to find another place to live (have deals in place on its own)

This process takes way longer than the agreed amount of time agreed so after that time the uk asked if they could please still live in the same house because finding a new place is hard. Its agreed but onder certain terms.

The uk doesn't follow those terms and is dragging its feet on leaving, is basically a disruptive influence on the rest of the household.

in this scenario would you say someone that's committed to breaking up and doesn't keep to agreements, that the uk actually wants to stay? or does it want a easy place to live.",,/r/europe/comments/e0ueho/uk_ignores_eu_disciplinary_action_over_failure_to/f8jtzgz/,d_nijmegen,1574604276

5960,"&gt;...once again it’s practicality over privilege haha. A vast majority of Americans own cars.

This is not a god-given fact, that's a result of the infrastructure.

&gt;Having a city optimized for cars, subways, trains, and even bikes, are the most practical methods to optimize a city on.

That's not a method. You can't optimize for every mode of transport at the same time.

&gt; Even horses got the thirty feet of space you feel your two foot body needs lol (width), because they use that space, like cars, people don’t

That's plain nonsense, people used the entire width of the street to walk on before it became illegal.

&gt;and that’s why people with cars get the “super special privilege” that you’re so irrationally jealous about.

That's not irrational. Just do the math: It costs a lot more space to move less people, and all the parkings everywhere ensurest that everything is further apart, making distances unnecessarily large. Up to 25% of space in car-centric American cities is taken up by parking, and that's very wasteful use of space.
