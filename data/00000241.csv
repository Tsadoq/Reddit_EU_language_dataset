As now German companies are no longer allowed (under threat of fine of the US) to trade certain goods with Iran, and therefore the potential profit cannot be created, they have lost money.

As this is considered damage inflicted on companies by outside parties (the US government), they can sue the US at the WTO.

And as the WTO has multiple times in the past issued judgements against the US for such cases, you can be rather sure that there will be some monetary recourse the EU can take. For example India (i think) was allowed to violate patents held by US companies and produce their own generic drugs.

So, if Germany / the EU wants to really be a bitch to Trump, his assets in the EU would be a rather fitting source for restitution. The US government might have to repay the Trump companies for that down the line, but just for the hastle alone it would be worth it.

If his EU assets aren't enough, the next areas hit would be assets of US companies that have their headquarters / main workforce in states controlled by the Republicans.

107,"&gt;Boeing complaing about illegal subsidies when it is basically kept afloat by the largest subsidy program of the world, the American military, really is rather ironic.

It isn't. Boeing makes everything from commercial jets, to missiles, to spaceships. It's business is much more diversified, and healthy business. Boeing can't work without profits, but airbus can because it will continue to be injected full of taxpayer money. 

&gt; the American military
How is the US supposed to get military planes then? Boeing competes with Northrup, Lockheed and many other defense companies for these contracts. Airbus doesn't compete for anything. They just get the money and unfairly compete. Are you going to consider all government contracts as subsidies? Those aren't even the problem. The problem are illegal or ""prohibited"" subsidies and these are the ones that US/Boeing has a problem with.

Also, Historically, Boeing has won the vast majority of rulings in the WTO. The upcoming one may just be in Boeing's favor. 

I feel like the discussion is getting sidetrack, so I will avoid going any further.

If the United States has been far from responsible with its powers, it’s still been far more responsible with its powers than previous global powers were. I think my main point is that you also live under the security that my government provides—that the US is the linchpin of the world order and the relative peace we have enjoyed for 3 quarters of a century, that it has done far more good than harm, and that the main “threat” it presents now is that it will no longer take seriously its obligation to promote liberal values and punish bad actors. I don’t condone all of the foreign interventions, but do you think that if the US had never intervened in foreign countries the world would be a better place? And what specific threat do you see the US posing if it’s not the one I mentioned? Genuine question here because you and others here seem to see the world in a radically different way than I do.

I think you've been influenced by some of the anti-EU talking points. The overhead in bureaucracy and cost is relatively small.    
      
Total budget of  the EU for 2018: 160 billion euro. On a total GDP of about 15 trillion euro, that's very slightly more than 1%.    
     
Some comparisons:    
    
Federal budget of Germany: 330 billion euro, or about 9.5% of GDP.    
Federal budget of USA: 4 trillion dollar, or about 21.5% of GDP.     
     
So you see, the bureaucratic overhead of the EU is fairly small, and I would argue that most of the work the EU does actually goes towards *reducing* the overhead and red tape involved in anything that crosses borders.

202,"&gt; Is the stupid ""why don't you want to buy our shit food!"" argument around the corner again or what?

No one but trump has ever made that argument, and it really ignores all of the illegal support and propping up of companies by the EU. 
Just bother reading into the airbus V. Boeing trial at the WTO. 
The WTO has already ruled that the ""infamous"" Washington tax breaks were legal, and that many of such ""subsidies"" that are concurrently cited by airbus supporters were legal. The few, about $3B, of illegals subsidies were addressed, and the US is considered to be in compliance with WTO rulings. The same can not be said about Airbus, which has refused to comply with about $25B in ""illegal subsidies.""
If the US refuses to comply after the Airbus ruling that is coming soon, tariffs will follow, but I bet people will claim that it's only part of the ""trade war"" and nothing to do with the actual WTO ruling.
You either believe in the system, WTO, or not. 

&gt;That's out, with the WTO ruling Boeing received illegal state subsidies.

nope.

I don't mean to be dismissive, of EU support. But you seem to make it seems as if paying 1/3 of what the US pays for a one year, or less campaign, somehow makes up for the decades of America paying most of the bills, and securing the capabilities to actually engage in warfare.

Lybia was a French-Anglo intervention, it makes sense for their contribution to be a little larger. Nonetheless, the US ended up paying most of the bill.

Blocking regulations are all about making it more profitable for the company to ignore the sanctions than to conform to them, because the cost of the sanctions will be fully refunded (or in some cases, because even higher fines are levied if they conform to the sanctions)

This is something that was done in the 90s and that could be done now, although it would cost the state a lot more money

In the 90s the European states had an economic advantage by doing it because the trade was more valuable than the cost of blocking regulations

Now the European states would lose money by doing it because the trade would be less valuable than the cost of blocking regulations

The author of the article you posted believes that this change means that European countries would not introduce blocking regulations now even though they did in the 90s

The US is widely criticized for both doing too much and too little to fight extremism.  The argument that there is a problem somewhere else is at best a weak one.  If Europeans think the UAE is so important then why are they not more focused on it addressing it themselves?

As for torture and illegal imprisonment that depends on who you ask and how you want to define what laws do and do not apply to the US.  We certainly do far less than Iran so if you are arguing in support of Iran, you are the one supporting torture and illegal imprisonment here.

Israel is perfectly happy to live in peace and has repeatedly offered peace.  muslims like the leaders of Iran are the reason that there is no peace there, not the Israelis.

So, let me get a few things straight: in an horrendously stupid decision, the army cut back on spare parts a few years ago. Yes, we have sometimes seen the results of this in recent years. That's a fact. However, the current ""wave"" you seem to see is a result of a\) media sensationalism, especially by the more right wing media \(BILD etc.\) and b\) the ongoing conflict between the heads of the German army and the ministry of defense, especially the head of said ministry, Ursula von der Leyen. The army wants her gone and is out for blood, leaking misleading and sometimes even falisfiable reports about the state of the army in an attempt to both get rid of her and receive more funding at the same time. That Eurofighter article that was here a week ago is a good example of this, as nothing of this is in any way based on falsifiable facts and is contradicted by other reports. Same with the u\-boat situation, which indeed aren't our of action but scheduled for maintanence outside of the usual circle because quite frankly, we have the time to do it right now. All but one are fully operational though and could go out to sea on extremely short notice.

&gt;As for me buying into military propaganda, that's hilarious. There is nothing I'd love more than our troops leaving Europe.

I never doubted that and quite frankly, please fuck off. Spares money and we have less bad drivers on the road. But that's not my point: my point is your inherent notion that the EU army is somewhat incapable of defending it's own territory, which is a myth invented by exactly that complex for reason easily to be seen through. F35 is a good example. ""Big bad Russians coming, spend more money! No no, don't develop your own plane to replace the Tornado, you need a replacement right now! Look, we have a plane with a vastly overridden budget we really need more buyers for, are you interested? Funny, what a coincidence!""

365,"&gt;  Putting maximum pressure on Kim just brought him to the table.

Bullshit. Talks with Xi Jiping did. Sanctions *never* stopped NK, and they developed nukes *while* sanctioned. NK survived literal famines that killed hundreds of thousands. You think recent sanctions somehow daunt it? Iran can do the same goddamn thing, and they can do it *right now* because of the deal breaking down. Especially now that the Iranian conservatives got handed their victory ***by Trump himself. Trump just did the Iranian conservatives a service.*** You know, the guys that *actually* want a nuke and don't give a damn about the foreign trade? Can't imagine why it would be good for them to *not* be proven right. Almost like Iran could start to move in a more politically liberal direction or something since it proves good for the populace and elite alike.

**And now Trump has just proved to Kim that he can't trust any deal made with America.**

Trump's claim were completely ludicrous, especially the ones about monitoring Iran's facilities. Iran **can't** cover up traces left behind by the shit required to build a nuke. Not unless they can halt inspections a few hundred million years.

The shit you and Trump want is essentially a complete dismantling of Iran's military, as well as turning Iran into an outright puppet state. Trump has literally made several of the same demands that the Austro-Hungarian empire made of Serbia, basically demanding to be allowed to freely police it.

If I were Macron or Merkel, I would summon all EU leaders at the Throne of Charlemagne (you need strong symbolic signals here, and Americans are typically well aware that they lack a long history) and issue a joint statement that clearly states that

1. The US decision is dangerous, stupid and wrong.

2. The EU will put Western values, in this case particularly *Pacta sunt servanda*,  above the relationship with the US.

3. The EU will stick to the contract if Iran sticks to it, too.

4. The EU will retaliate all potential negative consequences for EU companies that the US wishes to impose.

It may well be that a small number of EU countries (among these probably Poland) may not wish to sign such a statement, but then the statement would just mention the countries involved.

Independent observers:

&gt; There are no indications that Iran developed such weapons at the time.

You: Gun sales have increased, but gun murder has fallen. That surely means there is no correlation between guns and crime.



Me: I agree but, [how come the amount of gun owners has fallen, then?](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/03/20/us/20guns-webgraphic/20guns-webgraphic-popup.gif) Answer: Fewer people own guns, but the ones who do now own *more* guns than before. 




You: So there is no correlation between the amount of guns and violence. 




Me: I agree. It's about how many owners there are. It makes no difference if a gun-killer owns one or two guns. It makes a difference if he has zero or one gun. If you give 1 more gun to a guy who *did not* have a gun before, then that it's more dangerous (statistically).

[This is the table](https://i.imgur.com/t00Twu9.png). The figures are lower because in the first post I mistakenly included attempted crimes as well, but the end result is no different. I see no clear sign that violent crime is decreasing, or much less that it reached historically low levels.

547,"Around the Bothnian Bay in Sweden/Finland there's also a tribe called Kvens. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kvenland

And in the region north of Svealand in Sweden in what is today called Norrland (North Land) lived Hälsingar (Hälsings). There's atleast written records of them in: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribes_of_Widsith 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hälsingland#History

For a long time Hälsingland was used as a definition of the entire region of Norrland and wasn't a part of the kingdom of Sweden / Svealand until the 13-14th century. And when finally become part of Sweden the name of the region got more or less replaced by the name Norrland. Hälsingland as a name exists but as a much smaller provinces among others that make up the region.

So you should add Hälsingar as a tribe by the coast of Norrland.

567,"&gt;I was honestly kind of confused about Gotland because I wasn't sure if the names were simply coincidences or actually indicitative of the territorial control. 

It's just a similar name. Gotland was one of the richest places in all of northern Europe at this time due to trade. It was likely fairly independent, but might have been ruled by the Swedes at some point. 

[This guy writes about it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wulfstan_of_Hedeby), read the passage there. From what he says it sounds like the Swedes (Svealand) ruled over all land north of Denmark (on the east coast). But there was according to other sources kings in Götaland around the same time, so who knows. That guy might have not gotten the exact truth from whatever was his source. It was in 880 too, so not necessarily relevant to 800. The island was independent a century or two later as well, so it's really hard to know. 

On another topic, [this is the traditional ""lands"" of ""Småland""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sm%C3%A5land#/media/File:Map_of_landscape_Smaland_Sweden.jpg). Some of them might have been ruled by the Geats or Swedes at some points in history. But generally they were indpendent chiefdoms or whatever, and very isolated in the deep forests of that area. That's why they are still literally called ""small lands"". I would hesitate to include them in any Swedish kingdom, but you could also go with some source and stick with it I guess.

That does not make them political prisoners, in fact more times than not, both organizations are absolutely out of touch with any problem they try to meddle in. It is not up to them to decide that.

&gt;  that shows there is something really wrong with Spanish justice when judging people from national minorities.

Everyone is subject to law, no matter your origin, religion, political opinion or sex. Should it be any different would not only be unjust, but an insult to everyone without the privileges. That I cannot accept as even an argument.

&gt; Another example is that Germany completely rejected the accusation of rebellion against Puigdemont while Spain keeps it for other politicians (including Carme Forcadell, who was not even part of the government at that time!).

You don't need to be part of the goverment to be an active part of the coup d'etat, the main example would be the head of the mossos, who surprise surprise is not accused of rebellion. 

Also Germany? HA. The fiscal may disagree with you, as they have made more than clear that they see the charges as reasonable. 3 local judges, decided a really complicated matter, in the span of a week that even here there has been a debate for literal months between jurist of how to best aproach it. I'm sure they read the more than 1000 pages long report... What happened with puigemont was by the way a complete extralimitation of the judges there, but that is a completely different matter.

&gt;  The only explanation for that is that Spanish justice is not neutral when judging Catalans or Basques.

Completely out of the ass you got that.

Ukraine was incredibly far from such a thing. Just look at how hard and slow EU accession talks are going for the most advanced Western Balkans countries - Montenegro and Serbia. At best they're set to join in 2025 and the European Commission itself said that was quite ambitious despite it usually being super optimistic about this stuff in order not to discourage them.    Ukraine isn't even half of their level, it would take it ages to get into the EU and NATO.    

True usually NATO membership comes before EU but that may have been different in Ukraine because of Russia. As long as it felt safe Russian propaganda could easily convince them NATO was bad or bribe their politicians to stall. In fact I believe the whole EU process would be stalling immensely because Ukrainian politicians don't benefit from EU reforms and because of propaganda.    

But now... joining the Western sphere has become a matter of life or death for Ukraine. Things will probably move faster than if Putin had stayed put.

&gt;Russia annexed Crimea because it sees it as a strategical point in the black sea that they do not want to fall in NATO's hands.   

Yes, though really Russia sees everything that way. They'd annex the whole world if they could. It's not like this is unheard of. Every country used to be this way, but today Russia is one of the few that still thinks like an Imperial power. But people and economy are much more important than land these days and ironically Russia's land grabs are leaving it in a weaker position.


&gt; US's foreign policy historical stance against Russia is very aggressive and Russia gives it back to them (it goes both ways).   

What has the US done to Russia since the end of the Cold War? Yeah the US is generally very aggressive but not to nuke states. North Korea has been left alone all this years due to having half a functioning nuke, Russia with its arsenal is as safe as it can be. Only way for there to be war is if Russia starts it. And they've tried hard, 3 Europeans wars since 1989, how are people not more outraged? British citizens poisoned with WMDs, Dutch citizens shot out of the sky. Russia is really getting away with everything and it's definitely not trying to have peace.

695,"&gt;It probably needs to happen alongside fiscal transfers for the Eurozone to start working properly...

I would argue that fiscal transfer mechanism isn’t that essential, with the correct reforms, with decent target agreements and things like completion of the banking union. Indeed, I think it is an argument that is starting to gain some traction, people were to happy to write the Euro off at the hight of the crisis and people who were sceptical before felt vindicated. With people on either ends trying to push this narrative because it suited them.

Anyway, all a fiscal transfer mechanism means is a way that money can be moved from one place to another, it can taken many different forms and so I don’t see why it would need tax harmonisation. With many arguing beyond what the United States already has. Even if it was to take the form of a budget, I don’t see any reasons why it can not be different tax rates in different areas. 

&gt;The US has federal taxes creating a tax floor, and supporting the federal government. That includes corporation taxes..

USA states still have a lot of power, with some like Delaware having a reputation of being a low tax economy. 

&gt;It would certainly remove one of the tools members have to compete. 

This is the argument for tax harmonisation not because a fiscal union requires it. 

&gt;For the UK, joining the Euro would be poisonous politically, almost regardless.

Mainly because politicians and the press made it so. The euro is pretty popular in most of the countries that adopted it. With even the public in new adopters being pretty ok with it. The worst part about adopting the Euro is actually do it and I am pretty sure in time people in the UK would be pretty accepting of it. Even more so with European federalism, which still means that countries can have a lot of power with in it and national identities are protected. The press did a good job of scaremongering about that one. 

&gt;For the UK, joining the Euro would be poisonous politically, almost regardless.

I don’t think it is as anywhere near as politically poisnous as you think it is and if argued for in the right way can become pretty attractive. Like I said above, it would be different from having a referendum about the euro vs having one for eventually joining it. 

&gt;Any referendum in the future is going to be fought by the No side on opening borders, scrapping the pound, and federalisation.

Some leave campaigners made the same arguments during the last referendum doesn’t mean that they are correct or the public view them as a bad thing. 

 &gt;The idea that the government of countries where their populations do not support something as fundamental as a currency union would join one is pretty abhorrent.

You keep on overestimating the British opposing to the euro. I would imagine if the UK joined at the start, the public would be pretty supportive of it and wouldn’t want to leave. People move on and adapt like most things. Pretty confident that it wouldn’t be regarded as realistic to do so, there isn’t no article 50 for the euro. Besides a lot of countries that joined the euro showed polls with a majority not supporting it, government should lead and not lead to. 

&gt;I'm a Labour party member, I promise you it's a Labour and Conservative party thing. 

Labour members overwhelmingly voted to remain, there are polls show that Labour members support a referendum on the terms. Also, just because they are critical doesn’t mean that they want to leave. I think anyone can say something about the eu that they don’t like. 

&gt;If there hadn't been a left wing argument, the UK wouldn't be leaving the EU. 

No the leave side was largely driven by right wing politicians. The main figures in vote leave (with exceptions like Gisela Stuart) were Conservative politicians or have close ties to and Leave.EU/Grassroots out was more of a right wing Populist group. There were left wing campaigns but they were mute in comparison. 

 &gt;Once the issue was in the open, there was a lot of support to have a referendum.

The fact that the referendum was popular doesn’t mean that what is in them is popular. People normally like the idea of referendums regardless. 

&gt;It might be, it might not, it'll be interesting to see how young people who haven't been in the EU see it at that point. 

That would be quite a long way and there would still be that legacy, it would also depends on what happens in the rest of the EU and the benifts of joining (which you overestimate against). 

&gt;Which is why the UK had a non-binding, advisory referendum.

Just because they cannot make it binding doesn’t make it right.

&gt;The problem in the UK was that people had no way other than voting UKIP

UKIP weren’t the one who won office on the promise to hold a referendum so they clearly did have a choice and that doesn’t make it right either. The Front National got through to the 2nd round and won over 30% but Macron wouldn’t change his EU stance because of it. Part of governance is leadership not pandering.  

&gt;They didn't negate their responsibility, they asked for a direction.

The public is ill equipped to make such a decision, that is why representatives are elected. It shouldn’t be any more patronising than saying firefighters are in the best position to put out fires. I think Germany did the right things with this kind of referendum by banning them.

&gt;Not a chance

There certainly is a path to renter the EU and as I established you overstimulate the opposition to things like the euro, which isn’t even required as Sweden has shown. That was what people said after the referendum but they persisted and I am sure they can find a at to make it work afterwards.

738,"The EU has so much untapped potential. The EU could probably pull off being a confederate republic far better than the U.S. did. The US states and former colonies tended to be more similar than different, so the U.S. steadily became less a confederate republic and more of a republic with a strong federal presence. European countries would probably be better at avoiding agreeing to a stronger federal government due to a greater degree of diversity between them than between the states of the U.S. In my opinion, the EU could be a huge economic power (and military too if it chose) if it just cooperated enough to form a confederate republic with a weak federal entity. A lot of this I derive from Montesquieu.

Excerpt of Montesquieu

Book IX. 1, 3

&gt; If a republic be small, it is destroyed by a foreign force; if it be large, it is ruined by an internal imperfection.
To this twofold inconvenience democracies and aristocracies are equally liable, whether they be good or bad. The evil is in the very thing itself, and no form can redress it.

&gt; It is, therefore, very probable that mankind would have been, at length, obliged to live constantly under the government of a single person, had they not contrived a kind of constitution that has all the internal advantages of a republican, together with the external force of a monarchical, government. I mean a confederate republic.

&gt; This form of government (Confederate Republic) is a convention by which several petty [small] states agree to become members of a larger one, which they intend to establish. It is a kind of assemblage of societies, that constitute a new one, capable of increasing by means of further associations, till they arrive at such a degree of power as to be able to provide for the security of the whole body. It was these associations that so long contributed to the prosperity of Greece. By these the Romans attacked the whole globe, and by these alone the whole globe withstood them; for when Rome had arrived at her highest pitch of grandeur, it was the associations beyond the Danube and the Rhine—associations formed by the terror of her arms—that enabled the barbarians to resist her...

&gt; [A Confederate Republic], is able to withstand an external force, may support itself without any internal corruption; the form of this society prevents all manner of inconveniences.

&gt; If a single member should attempt to usurp the supreme power, he could not be supposed to have an equal authority and credit in all the confederate states. Were he to have too great an influence over one, this would alarm the rest; were he to subdue a part, that which would still remain free might oppose him with forces independent of those which he had usurped, and overpower him before he could be settled in his usurpation.

&gt; Should a popular insurrection happen in one of the confederate states, the others are able to quell it. Should abuses creep into one part, they are reformed by those that remain sound. The state may be destroyed on one side, and not on the other; the confederacy may be dissolved, and the confederates preserve their sovereignty.

&gt; As this government is composed of petty republics, it enjoys the internal happiness of each; and with regard to its external situation, by means of the association, it possesses all the advantages of large monarchies.",,/r/europe/comments/8hvdzn/irish_people_in_favour_of_the_eu_goes_over_90_for/dyn8tge/,Goofypoops,1525793276

Are guns the reason the US has a high murder rate? Well, let's look at where the US ranks, in the world for murder rate. Where do you think [that is?](https://www.indexmundi.com/facts/indicators/VC.IHR.PSRC.P5/rankings) (Think before clicking.)

Are there countries with high gun ownership rates, but [low homicide rates?](http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/small-arms-survey-countries-with-the-most-guns-1.3392204)

Does gun control (which is a very vague term. Do you mean a ban, or registration?) work? The answer is that it [does not seem to make much difference, or leads to higher crime.](https://crimeresearch.org/2013/12/murder-and-homicide-rates-before-and-after-gun-bans/)

I don't mind the interest, but I get very frustrated by the willful ignorance.

BTW, the answer to the previous questions.

1. Most common gun used in a murder is a revolver. Murders by rifles of all types are less than murders by hands and feet.

2. Urban, black males between 15-25 have a homicide rate of over 77 per 100,000. All those NRA members that you hate? Hardly ever commit any crime.

The important part is that the number of arrivals of refugees to the EU massively decreased after Germany got involved, to the point that we are now at pre-crisis numbers again. I'd call that securing the borders which you describe as right-wing, the CDU has also always been in favor of deportations, those however are the responsibility of the German states and courts, not the German federal government. The only thing the German government can do is to close loopholes and declaring countries as save so deportations to that country can happen, that's what Asylpaket I&amp;II were for, the only reason why those didn't include Northern Africa or Afghanistan was because the SPD has been blocking it, the CDU was always in favor of deportations to Afghanistan. Keep in mind that between 2013 and 2017 the Linke, Greens and SPD held the majority in the German parliament and were also part of almost all state governments.

&gt;Beatrix von Storch: requests gun use at the borders, is against abortions and thinks the climate change isn't real.

858,"A tax haven is a region in which there is zero or close to zero corporate tax. It describes places like Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, St. Lucia. The Irish 12.5% corporate tax rate is very far from that, and very few loopholes exist for businesses located in Ireland. The ""double Irish"" was a mechanism whereby multinationals would abuse the difference between Irish rules treating multinational revenues (which tax only domestic revenues, considering the rest taxable to where the company is headquartered) and rules of other jurisdictions. They'd set up letterbox non-companies in *actual* tax havens, and book their profits through Ireland, but attributed to those shell corporations. The double-Irish-dutch-sandwich (is anyone else hungry) is similar but more complex, but also abuses rules in the Netherlands to the same end.

That particular loophole  was ended by legislative change in Ireland back in 2014, giving companies currently utilizing it a couple years to stop using it (you can't expect multibillion dollar corporations to completely restructure their tax affairs overnight). To date, Ireland remains one of the only countries to ever change it's laws to *prevent* multinational corporate tax evasion. The fact also remains that the countries most facilitating this are the US (which straight up allows it's companies to keep revenues offshored and never pay tax on it) and the UK (which vassalizes most of the actual tax havens as ""crown dependencies"" or ""overseas territories"").",Connacht,/r/europe/comments/8hvdzn/irish_people_in_favour_of_the_eu_goes_over_90_for/dyn1mew/,KilometresOMalley,1525786171

877,"&gt; he essentially called for violence against others simply because they fared better in the capitalist system

...Not really. Otherwise he wouldn't be best buds with Engels, who worked for his family's business, of which he was a stakeholder.

Marx understood that there were fundamental contradictions within capitalism and that these contradictions would lead to suppression of the workers by the owners. The owners had political and economical power and could easily hold their own on those terms. For the balance of power to shift would mean the owners giving up power, which they aren't likely to do and use force if necessary (as has been shown throughout history). If one side uses force and the other doesn't it is not likely to end well for the side that doesn't.

879,"Ok, so my replies:

1. ""But both markets stagnating and markets increasing are results of the competition aspect. Because competition's goal is to kick out other competition. When this is achieved, there is stagnation. So the very goal of competition is a negative state of affairs.""

Not true in this case, since this market was created from a scratch, it didn't exist before. My company was one of the few leaders who has designed not only new devices but also a new workflow for doctors, and it actually took a long time to prove to the doctors that this workflow is better both for the doctors and patients. then other companies came in, when the market has expanded drastically.

2. ""And who made the decision to create mediocre products for high prices? "" 

No one, it is what a new technology costs. R&amp;D is complex and expensive, market is small so in order to make any profit at all you must put a high price on your goods. In production it is always like that - the higher volume, the less price; the smaller the volume, the higher the price. But then if market expands, and your sales are good (as it happened) there is no point in lowering price and designing a new product, since sales are already good - that's where competition comes in.

3. ""Would you willingly create mediocre products if you were given the choice?"" - 

An engineer's job is to design the most cost-effective design while meeting the initial requirements for the product. So a product always gets not as good as you can make it, because you must save costs and not go over the top with features. But again, if there is no competition - you get lazy and do not try as hard as when it's stepping on your heels.

By the way, I used to work in a state-funded research university, but left it due to shitty salary and shitty management. Oh, and my work was useless because the management (appointed by the state) always came up with useless shit which sounded good only on paper. Now I have been working in a western company for the last ten years, and these have been amazing years. Everything is so much better simply because the founders actually care about their business. In the beginning it was their garage company - now it is a large enterprise, and I watched it grow. No way a state manager will ever be as efficient and flexible as people whose actually own the place.

The thing is, your ownership of those tools and that equipment is arbitrary. You're not actually using them yourself, you just have them so that people like me have no choice but to go through you for our production, so that you can skim some profit off the top despite not actually contributing anything other than your arbitrary permission to use the equipment.

You can argue that I have the option of going elsewhere and selling my labour to a different capitalist, but the relationship there isn't going to be meaningfully different, the only difference will be how much or how little the other guy takes off the top. If my labour is in demand, then I might be able to get different firms to compete for it, so that I get a better deal, but there's a limit to how good that deal will be, because my employer always needs to be able to make a profit off my labour. Beyond a certain point, my labour will no longer be in demand. Marx's theory basically holds that as production becomes more and more capital intensive, and less labour intensive, that point will grow lower and lower.

Eventually, the only option for people who don't own capital will be to refuse to recognise the private ownership of that capital, and demand the full benefit of their production.

What happens in Sweden is only relevant for Sweden. Trying to compare Germany to Sweden is irrelevant because you're dismissing statistics from both countries and relying only on vague articles that have no sources for their claims, but only the subjective personal accounts of a few people.

&gt; The two sources can sometimes show contradictory images when compared.  While NTU often gives a more accurate picture of the actual vulnerability of the population, crime statistics are a valuable source to see how much burden the judiciary has as a result of crime.

The population's vulnerability refers to the fear mongering phenomenon that's being discussed in the DW article..

969,"40% of all small satellites are made in the UK. They are global leaders in satellite development through companies like SSTL. Although some of these are technically part of the multinational EADS astrium they are based in the UK, staffed by Brits and tied into British academic institutions like the world-renown University of Surrey Space Centre. The UK has a proven track record of delivering on military satellite programs... indeed it was the UK that designed the encryption technology for Gallileo. For example, the UK's family of [Skynet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skynet) military communication satellites provide most of the military coverage for NATO in Europe and bandwidth is leased out to other countries for a profit.

This GPS project is by no means outside of the UK's technical capability and they have the money to do it if they want. This entire project only costs as much as one of their [two new supercarriers](https://ukdj.imgix.net/2017/12/MH170004020.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&amp;fit=crop&amp;h=580&amp;ixlib=php-1.1.0&amp;q=80&amp;w=1021&amp;wpsize=td_1021x580&amp;s=bdc592b4e88380a39fde717571b04428).

Remember that whilst Italy and Germany were mainly interested in the civilian applications of Galileo, the main priority for France and the UK (who both have serious military's) was the high precision military aspect. The UK alternative is likely to be complimentary to the GPS/BOC 1.1 system, working alongside Galileo and GPS, but giving the UK the redundancy of having their own dedicated satellites for military use. 

Remember as well that the UK's entire strategic nuclear deterrent is the submarine launched Trident II D5 ICBM. Unlike France for example who also have the [ASMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air-Sol_Moyenne_Port%C3%A9e) air or ship launched nuclear tipped cruise missile or gravity bomb. It is quite likely the Trident missile can use GPS as part of its orientation and target selection, and therefore this satellite system will also form part of the UK's strategic nuclear deterrent.

Until the world is perfect? I'd say every single one of us, because it will never be.

&gt; many more have died under capitalism either through starvation or lack of proper health care than anyone ever has under communism

Mostly because almost no one still lives under communism. Many more died proportionally when under communism than the reverse.

Also, at least living conditions around the world are improving. We can't make it a perfect place over night, and we'll make mistakes along the way, but at least we're making some progress.

&gt; Besides, all of the starvation deaths under communism can be attributed to a few famine events

Kind of disingenuous to ignore the millions that were purposefully murdered (Gulags, Killing Fields, Struggle sessions, ...).

&gt; mostly caused by environmental factors

Lol. Stalin genociding Ukraine is environmental? Mao's stupid policies are environmental? Current day Venezuela is environmental?

&gt; whereas with our current system we justify writing off about 10-20 million every year

[citation needed], because what I find is around 9 million starvation deaths a year.

1051,"&gt; Oh no, I do not think otherwise. But when they go after the ones throwing bricks through a window they attack the protesters. So others come up to defend them and that's how you get police injuries. Sometimes they even attack without reason (rare but happens).

Well it's their literal job to protect the property of people as well from criminal vandalism. So they had to take action to stop it or at least reign it in and arrest the perpetrators. At that point, when other people who are up until then innocent intervene and attack the police for doing what is necessary to preserve order, they become complicit criminals too. I just can't recall events where that happened before to this extent, with so many criminals in one place committing criminal acts together.

The Euro 2000 riots in Charleroi between English and German hooligans perhaps came close.

&gt; Fascists are stupid but they won't start to throw molotovs in the Parliament... what else should they do except threaten and beat commies, NGO members, non-whites? People with no political power.

The people whose possessions were destroyed also had no political power, which is obviously different from physical violence. Though ... I admit I'm scared that it's only a matter of time before far leftists also aim their arrows at civilians they disagree with; the hatred and threatening langauge I've read on this board (not per se this subreddit itself alone) is concerning too, especially because the mob mentality seems much stronger, which isn't illogical as it's literally a collective ideology.

&gt; Your first comment asked for destructive behaviour by other political groups in a single event. I gave you far worse events and the reasons why fascists don't have the police against them during protests (no hate towards capitalism -&gt; no vandalism -&gt; no police intervention; many fascists are policemen -&gt; no repression unless strictly necessary) but you discarded them because they are not done during rallies.

I guess there was a miscommunication. I literally meant destruction caused by large groups (as in lots of people at one place at the same time) at a single location. I guess people interpreted that ""group"" as ideological group, not a ""group of people"" at one place.

That's why the counter-examples weren't revelant to me, as I'm already fully aware that individuals or tiny groups from the far right have been known to commit far worse acts, yet on a smaller scale and I never implied otherwise (though people may have read it that way due to interpreting ""group"" differently)

&gt; They are two different behaviours that have reasons behind them, as if I asked you to show me events of blacks being beaten by a small group of communists. It does not happen because it's not the group's praxis/ideology.

That's a valid criticism, I'll accept that.

Though I hope you can also understand why I do find mass events like in Hamburg scary myself, especially because of the lack of condemnation for these mass crimes in group. Our far right party would never say anything good about a Breivik or even a sole (empty) mosque arsonist, yet leftist groups seem to freely support this kind of destruction and violence.

That does strike some fear in me: one day I might be the target for being a normal civilians with some moderate possessions, a relatively centrist ideo-set all in all (some left, some right) ... will I be an enemy some day if their group grows? There is a lot of violence condoning rethoric going on too, as much if not more than on the right I feel.

The fact that you had to add that fudge factor really confirms my analysis of your POV: you just label 95% of all possibilities on the axis as capitalism. Not really surprising that the best possible combination comes from that 95% then, is it? But then the label capitalism is all but meaningless.

&gt;State capitalism is capitalism. Social democracy is capitalism. 

By that labelling system, the USSR after the perestroijka was capitalist too. If you label everything capitalism, the label capitalism becomes meaningless.

1097,"Semi factual.. You need to check who was in power and who Tsar Nicholas appointed to run the provisional government. Check their names.. They were all members and aquaintenses of Royal blood. Nicholas abdication was to 'apease' the masses. And was nothing but a gimmick or a ploy, to put the people he wanted to take control. A 'provisional goverment'... That would put two royally acreddited candidates up for a vote? You call that change? You might as well call Putins government a well functioning democracy....  Because what the provisional government represented was far less accomodating than even putin. And let us not pretend that the provisional government had much power either at that time of turmoil (despite trying to control the situation). There were many factions ready to overthrow and take control. 

As for Stalins rise to power.. Lenin had stated categorically that Stalin must never lead. He had leon Trotsky killed with an ice pick and numerous others, and systematically took out everyone who opposed him.

There is no reason to have a 'provisional government' which is identical to the royals they wanted to step down.. Who in turn were to put up candidates that served them. That is the very definition of a puppet election.

And let us not pretend our democracies are not headed in the same direction, as major company capitalist interests are what fund, bankroll and decide who wins essentially. Its social engineering. I find it amusing how upset the West gets when Putin fucks with them.. But they do it all the time... Hell the US NRA, is such a big player in the USA, they cant even pass basic common sense gun legislation.

""The Polish-American historian Marek Jan Chodakiewicz stressed that after the Soviet takeover of Poland in 1945 violence had developed amid postwar retribution and counter-retribution, exacerbated by the breakdown of law and order and a Polish anti-Communist insurgency. According to Chodakiewicz, some Jewish ""avengers"" endeavored to extract justice from the Poles who harmed Jews during the War and in some cases Jews attempted to reclaim property confiscated by the Nazis. These phenomena further reinforced Żydokomuna sentiment. Chodakiewicz noted that after World War II, the Jews were not only victims, but also aggressors. He describes cases in which Jews cooperated with the Polish secret police, denouncing Poles and members of the Home Army. Chodakiewicz noted that some 3,500 to 6,500 Poles died in late 1940s because of Jewish denunciations or were killed by Jews themselves.""

&gt;
&gt;Your accounting of US religious geography is impoverished and, ironically, backwards in the way that people are backwards when they get all of their politics from television.
&gt;
&gt;I could take you on a tour of thriving and wealthy religious communities in the heart of DC and NYC, spread out over tens of large congregations. I could take you on a tour of thriving religious communities throughout the agricultural midwest, which is a large area that, on average, leads the nation in average income everywhere except for the wealthiest urban centers. Have you ever been to Denver, Phoenix, Portland, Atlanta, Minneapolis, Des Moines, Dallas, Houston, or Orange County? All of those areas are heavily religious.  You are too ignorant to know how uninformed you are.

Positive correlation between religiosity and social and economical backwardness is a fact. It holds both for the USA and the world at large.

&gt;&gt;Not seeing any evidence so far, just a bunch of handwaving and poor logic.

&gt;Where is your evidence?

&gt;Handwaving and poor logic? All I have from you is..derp...Religious areas is poor! I was actually taking it easy on you, because you aren't giving me any logic to work with and you obviously don't know your topic. You made the unsupported assertion, not me. Your rhetorical incompetence is starting to bite you on the ass.
&gt;
&gt;I could school and embarrass  you on the topics of economic and religious geography. There is no ""logic"" involved in what I told you. It is fact. Which, I know, is something that Marxists have trouble reconciling. When they use weasel word excuses like ""hand waving"" to substitute for the fact that they don't have a response then I know that they are out of their league and trying to bullshit their way through an argument.

&gt;&gt;""Whenever it is fully implemented as communism"" tells me that you do not know the marxist definition of the Communist society.
&gt;
&gt;LOL...sure I know the ""definition"" of a communist society. I know your retarded ideology as good or better than you do, which is why I'm against it. I like free shit to, but Communism's singular purpose is deceit. Yes, I know that you think that ""dat real communism"" is when the State disintegrates, but that will never happen for very specific and unmovable reasons. Which is why your ideology is a lie and why the manifestation that you read about in the USSR and see in China is, indeed, fully implemented communism.

Congratulations, you went to Wikipedia and learned the marxist definition of the Communist society. However, demonstrating religious immunity to facts, you persist in calling ""Communist"" the societies that do not fit the definition.

&gt;&gt;You may as well claim that religion does not lead to oppression and mass murder.
&gt;
&gt;Religion is a belief in a principle, period. 

Maybe go again to the Wikipedia and read the definition of religion. Your ignorance is tiresome.

&gt;Communism is as much of a religion as any religion, only it raises the mechanical proletariat, which is as opposite to the traditional concept of god as one can get, to the place of god.


Right, and science is ""as much of a religion as any religion"". To someone who does not know the definition of either, that is.


&gt;Any belief can lead to mass murder, and so your assertion has no meaning because it applies to every political or other belief. However, the fact is that Marxism killed 100 million people in the 20th century and Mormonism, for instance, did not.

1239,"Comparing Venezuela and Chavez to the USSR is borderline hilarious, as if both are even remotely similar in anything. It is like comparing Pinochet with Thatcher, or Erdogan with Mullah Omar.

Like it or not, Chavez was an enormously popular politician who managed to die before he saw the shit he created, he died before the commodities boom ended and Venezuela went to the dogs, despite his attempts at taking power through a coup he won elections, and his opponents are very controversial figures themselves. In 2006 Chavez won by a massive landslide when he won 62% to Capriles 36%. Even with electoral fraud, you don't get such a high a landslide in Venezuelan politics. 

Here is an idea between the garbage Venezuela had to pick from in the last election which Maduro barely won under slightly questionable circumstances.

&gt;The campaign was characterised by insults from both sides. Examples include Maduro calling Capriles ""Prince of the Bourgeoisie"" and ""capricious"", while Capriles described Maduro as ""Satan""[19] and as ""bird brain"", ""great fool"", and ""liar"".[20] Maduro also ""employed comments that were regarded as homophobic, calling Capriles a 'little princess' while declaring 'I have my woman, I like women'.""[20] In the campaign, Maduro sang a rap song in which he described his opponent as ""the little bourgeois shit who shits himself of fear when the people raise their voice"". He also implied that Capriles was gay, referring to him being unmarried. Capriles then said he loves so many women he can't decide. He also declared that Maduro's wife was ugly and asked who wants to be with her.[21]

If, and quite possibly when, AMLO wins Mexico it won't be a violent revolution or due to one, but because his opponents did a great job making him look like reasonable alternative, same way they did with Chavez. People forget that Venezuela was crumbling for the last 40 years and the chaos in the 90s which brought Chavez to power.

1242,"&gt;In the US, worker's movements basically went nowhere until politicians, often from old and powerful families, provided them with the right to organize and collectively bargain. 




This is just simply wrong. Worker’s rights were not simply “bestowed” upon Americans. American workers engaged in firece batle with corporations to fro the right to unionize and the ability to collectivly bargain. From organizations like the American Federation of Labor, the Congress of Industrial Labor, to the knights of labor, Americans founded unions and fought THEMSELVES thier rights. Americans went on numberous strikes that had to be crushed by the government, and were not afraid to be violent to secure there rights. Heck even the UAW (United Automobile Workers) gained recognition by occupying a factory in Flint, Michigan an refused to leave till thier demands were met. The individuals in power made changes because they had to make changes. They made changes because the workers put thier feet to the fire to the point were they could not longer avoid their demands. 




&gt;Then there is the direct bestowment of rights and social security to the poor by the closest thing we have to royalty, the Roosevelts.



Is your point here that what makes a monarchy is not ths hereditary rule by one family over the state, but instead the ability of one family to “bestow” rights upon the poor? Thats just wrong. Also I think it is important to point out that its quite ironic how you mention the Roosevelts when Teddy Roosevelt was known as the “trust-buster” and literally went around breaking up companies and forcing corporations to make concessions to worker’s rights orgs.

Here's the rate by subject, it says that the national murder rate was 6.0 . It's likely higher because village communes and tribalism in the North Caucasus may prevent police from intervening or solving blood feud related murders, but it can't be so high as to make the number anywhere above 8.

1324,"I know, that's what most people said: this case was heavily commented because most of us assumed the French law makes any sexual relationship between an adult and a minor who's less than 15 years old non-consensual/rape (and yes, makes the abuser a pedophile, who thus should be sentenced to a harsher sentence than if he had raped an adult). But it turns out there is no age statute below which a minor is said to not being able to consent. That will probably change very soon though (as I wrote, the government is about to present a bill in the Parliament, which covers several new measures related to sexual and sexist offenses. I don't remember exactly what the new proposed law will be on that particular matter: sorry I can't be bothered to google it right now, I remember reading about it and noting that feminist activists apparently thought it was not good enough, it was quite complicated to understand in my opnion. I'll write about it here in future threads when the MPs vote on it). 

So (I just checked again the articles on these 2 cases)

-1) The man was 28 and the girl,""Sarah"", 11 (It happened in April 2017). The man's lawyer said that the girl lied about her age: she allegedly told him she was 18. She on the contrary said that she showed him her school liaison diary (on which you can clearly see that she was in her first year of middle school). The man had approached her before in a park near her building and chit-chatted to her. When he approached her again as she was walking back from school, she followed him to his flat and they 'had sex'. She then knocked on her neighbor's door and told her about it, allegedly saying that ""she kind of agreed to it"", but then when said neighbor called the mom (who was at work) and the 11 year-old repeated her story she expressed her confusion and shock. The mom filed a complaint for rape (as you would do), but since there was no use of violence, threat or surprise and that the age difference apparently isn't considered to be a sufficient element to qualify as ""constraint"", the magistrate decided that a jury wouldn't (and shouldn't - in the prosecuter's eyes, maybe, idk) convict him for ""rape"", but opted for the lesser offense of ""atteinte sexuelle"" (= up to 5 years of prison only). Journalists published articles about the case shortly before the trial and when the trial occurred they decided to postpone it, I *think* this time he will be judged for rape. So we'll see.

-2) The man was 22 and the girl, ""Justine"",  11 too (I remembered 13, I don't know why). This one happened in 2009, but went on trial last autumn only (which is totally 'normal' in France. Our justice system is vastly underfinanced). The  details are also quite minimal. The man met the girl outside of her building and she followed him to a nearby park were he 'had sex' with her on the ground. She allegedly said that she said no but that he was preventing her from moving. The man said that she had consented and that she had lied, saying she was ""14, about to turn 15"" or ""15, about to turn 16"" - depending on the articles (the age of ""sexual majority"" I was mentioning before, that most people know about, is 15, so I mean, even if she lied... you're the adult, play it safe). Anyway she's 11, this 22 year-old man has sex with her, she doesn't tell anyone... she ends up pregnant. That's when she tells her parents. A complaint is filed. The trial happens almost 10 years later (...) (what about the pregnancy you may ask. Well, she didn't have an abortion, it was much too late, she had the baby. Great story! The kid was given up to the social services. Poor little kids, both of them. ). So the trial is for ""rape"" (that's why it happened much later than in the other case: the Court is different and since they are overworked, victims -and innnocent until proven guilty accused people- have to wait several years before a verdict. Since the elements presented couldn't prove this wasn't consensual, the man was acquitted. Yep. Again, there were articles (these two trials happened during the same time period last autumn, which probably boosted the media attention, plus it was during the MeToo movement) and the Court decided to appeal the decision so there will be a new trial too for this case. 

-Both stories are very similar. One might really wonder why in one case the prosecution decided that, given the lack of elements proving the rape in their minds, they decided to treat it as ""atteinte sexuelle"" (sexual abuse, instead of sexual crime), while in the other case they considered it rape and asked for 8 years (which the jurors didn't agree with). There is another similarity: incidentally both little girls were black. This led to comments about the fact that maybe the outcome would have been different if it had been white girls. (Black girls are seen as more ""mature"" sexually, or more quickly). Many people think that a girl's physical appearance is indicative of her psychological, physiological and cognitive maturity (We don't even know what they looked like at the time, obviously. But I mean, even if they looked older than 11 - I know it can be actually difficult to assess the age of girls between the ages of 14 and 20ish, but 11... not buying it at all and that wouldn't even matter if they looked 18). There were  rumors propagated online, which to my knowledge are totally made up: a rumor about the fact that one of these two girls had fake ID papers (= an immigrant whose mother lied in order to get the nationality) and thus wasn't in fact 11 but older : completely false apparently. Another rumor about the fact that one of the girl (the same maybe, I don't remember which case that was about since the two were being commented at the same time) had sent nudes to adult men : again, apparently made up but propagated on online forums (that wouldn't matter either imo). I even read comments about the fact that one of the mothers was prostituting her 11 year-old daughter. It's crazy what people can write on such cases without having any access to the details.

1447,"I understand how genetic clusters work. That's completely besides the point. It doesn't matter if there's any more to ""race"" than surface level looks for our discussion. The fact is that racism is hatred or categorization of people in superiority-inferiority rankings based on **biological** grounds, rather than ideological ones. Otherwise the 30 years war was about racism. The Austrian Civil war in the interwar period was too. Any conflict between phenotypically identical, but ideologically opposed groups would have to be considered racist in motivation. That's an absurd way of defining the word. Racism is, essentially, ""judging people by the color of their skin [or more broadly: their origin, looks, etc.], rather than the content of their character.""

&gt;Lol, so you want to give all racists easy excuses? 

If people only make valid arguments against other cultures based on the values these cultures objectively foster and the practices they endorse, then there's nothing objectionable about that. It doesn't matter one bit what they're secretely motivated by as long as all their arguments are sound and defensible on non-racist grounds. Climate change could be used by anti-humanist, anti-natalist types as a cover to spread their agenda, too. Should we forbid climate scientists from speaking because it can be used by bad people to justify bad things? As long as what they advocate is sensible, I don't give a damn about their ""secret"" motivations. I can't look into their minds and I don't need to.

Calling out a very prevalent version of gipsy culture as opposed to Western liberalism, intentionally and explicitely parasitic and harmful, and bad in so many other ways (patriarchal, abusive, authoritarian, violent, etc.) must be allowed.

1465,"&gt; Of course it did. The Soviet was the worker council. All the enterprises were owned by the people and managed by the Communist Party in its stead. To deny that a country with zero (almost) private property was socialist is ridiculous.

No, it didn't. As I said, Lenin got rid of the soviets, delegation and all that jazz almost immediately after seizing power. All decisions were made, and all the profits were reaped by the Central committee and other prominent party members.

Ownership means having the right to use the object, the right to the goods derived from it (crops, factory produce), and the right to alienate it, ie. to destroy the owned thing, or to transfer some or all rights to someone else. In the Soviet Union, virtually all means of production were *de facto* privately owned by the Communist Party, not the people. Lenin called it ""state capitalism"" for a reason - that is exactly what it was.

If I am forced to work for a shitty wage, with no say in what or how is made, and everything I make is owned by someone else, then it doesn't matter whether that someone else are calling themselves Mega McCorp or the Communist Party. To say that USSR was socialist because some assholes liked to fancy themselves as such is like saying that North Korea is democratic.

&gt; Oh, the company you work for (and ""own"") goes bankrupt? Tough luck, the cooperatives running the other companies don't want you to share in their profits.

Oh, the capitalist enterprise you work for goes bankrupt? Tough luck, capitalists running other companies don't want to hire you, or pay you a wage you could survive on. Except that, given the much more higher survival rates of cooperatives, you are statistically more likely to get in such situation in a capitalist setting than a socialist one.

&gt; You want an over-arching structure ensuring the equal access of all people to all the means of production and the goods they produce? You're back at Soviet style socialism.

If you ask me, providing equal access for all people to all means of production is impossible, although who knows what the ever increasing automation will bring. Neither worker ownership nor wage labour are good models when most of the work is done by machines. Anyway, Soviet style central planning with a small group of people deciding who gets to use what is hardly but that.

The Soviet Union was an attempt to bring about a socialist state. Any such attempt will necessarily fail, not because they did, but because Marx was wrong about everything, from LTV, to exploitation, to historical materialism. Lenin *did* try a more radical experiment first, which failed so badly and cost so many lives, that even a socialist ideologue like him had to reorganize with his New Economic Policy.

Oskar Lange's ""market socialism"" that he so vehemently developed and defended was also completely scrapped as an idea that he never implemented it when he was in charge. The Yugoslavian worker cooperatives were so awful that it too had to change systems.

Whenever tried, socialism either evolves into soviet-style central planning or gradually into capitalism, when its politicians have any concern for their people's wellbeing (like Deng). To point to ""workers collectives"" *within* a capitalist society as evidence of their superiority as a general modus operandi is absurd.

1503,"Germany through holding Rhine which connects it to the North Sea had much better position to trade goods, to have better logistics than many other nations. It's also important how it is positioned, Benelux was rich region from middle ages, which kickstarted market economy inspiring British which perfected idea and exported it globally. Therefore Germany held navigable river which opened for them three most developed markets in XIX century excluding USA (early XIX not really that big market). That's mine opinion. I felt that caspianreport could cover Germany more thoroughly, but I think he did good job overall. 


Riverways are maybe not so important now, but they helped to grow economy and trade along their paths, fostered new settlements and so on. USA also benefits from this.

How on Earth does this analogy work? Adam Smith didn't propose funding jihadists in Afghanistan, nor does his economic theory have anything to do with ethno-nationalism or fascism.

Karl Marx directly, explicitly and unapologetically called for violence against a group of people.

Here are some delightful quotes from Marx. I hope someone can find some quote of Adam Smith that justifies funding jihadists in Afghanistan:

&gt; The theory of Communism may be summed up in one sentence: Abolish all private property.

&gt; Money is the jealous god of Israel, in face of which no other god may exist.

&gt; Contempt for theory, art, history, and for man as an end in himself, which is contained in an abstract form in the Jewish religion, is the real, conscious standpoint, the virtue of the man of money.

&gt; Very well then! Emancipation from huckstering and money, consequently from practical, real Judaism, would be the self-emancipation of our time.

&gt; The very cannibalism of the counterrevolution will convince the nations that there is only one way in which the murderous death agonies of the old society and the bloody birth throes of the new society can be shortened, simplified and concentrated, and that way is revolutionary terror.

&gt; We have no compassion and we ask no compassion from you. When our turn comes, we shall not make excuses for the terror.

1559,"&gt; and to be among different people than northerners whom they already spend most of the year with.

So what exactly do you want? Because I usually don't take time off my schedule to be among people of my own country which I don't know, let alone tourists. I have my friends and my social circle, and you are not a part of them, just like most other portuguese people are not part of them. There is literally no such thing as travelling somewhere ""be among different people"". I'm not a tourist attraction. Should I pretend to be your friend and want to hang out?

What exactly does a tourist who wants to ""experience a different culture"" want? Most of them can't speak the language! I could point you to places where you could eat like a local, but guess what, you'd either not enjoy it because most locals aren't paying top money for food so our daily meals are rather banal, or you'd not even be able to make an order because they don't understand english. Places which are popular with tourists are so for a reason, and that is that they give you something tailored to you for a price. People who work there will make every effort to communicate with you in a language you understand, which can't be expected of most everyone else. They can provide you with some unique food experiences from typical dishes which we mostly don't eat every day and when we do, we usually cook at home. Or you can go to the places where locals have their daily lunch and enjoy the usual cheap dailies. Literally steak with fries or boiled fish or any such normal food that you could get at home.

If you want a ""local experience"" be read not to be impressed. Our lives aren't special or somehow better than yours.

I don't mean to be blunt but the only way to get a ""local experience"" is to actually live here for a while, make friends here, build your own social circle here. Learn the language, have a job, etc... Nobody is going to pretend to be your friend or have a good time with you if you are going to stay here for a week unless you put in the effort. So why not enjoy the architecture, go to places which are full of tourists because they are legitimately interesting sights and experiences? Just because a restaurante or food thing is full of tourists it doesn't mean it's bad or unauthentic. Heck, ""authentic"" pasteis de belém are literally only sold at one place in Lisbon and they are always full of tourists, which doesn't mean they aren't the best pasteis you can get.",,/r/europe/comments/8hm6sm/byebye_locals_tourists_are_taking_over_europes/dym3438/,[deleted],1525736410

p87: 54% Poles totally disagree (while 35% totally agrees) that Poland could face better future without the EU; 

p50 &amp; 92; Poles got way more trust in EU instituations (parliament/comission/ECB) than in polish gov/parliament (trust EU instituations : 43/45/36, polish gov/par 29/22)

p.97: Trust in EU 43 trust vs 42 no trust

p. 101 the younger the people the more trust in EU they got (from 39% in eldest group to 52 in youngest); distrust is pretty even across the board with ~42

p.103 image of the EU: 50% got total possitive, total negative at 14. When it comes to agre groups slightly over 50 got totally possitive.

1646,"&gt;Does it make you sad to see Russia beating USA in these statistics?

I don't want the chart to be misleading; I guess I should have put the year for when the statistics were published.

First as a disclaimer, the information collected by the United Nations for these countries above took place between 2011-2016.

The 11.31 rate for Russia is from 2011. Their most recent rate recorded is from 2017, and it is now at 6. 

European Russia's murder rate hovers around 3-4. The rate is inflated nationally due to Siberia (some regions as high as 28, but almost all of Siberian Russia's rate as a whole is above 10). [I found this cool link.] (https://academic.oup.com/esr/article-abstract/19/1/41/551334)

I guess I do see hope for them. The murder rate in Russia in 2006 was at 20.02, and it is now 6. Hopefully we can see that drop to Europe's average rate. My dream is for violence to cease and world peace.",,/r/europe/comments/8hr0x7/as_an_american_i_was_curious_to_know_the_murder/dylvofq/,Vartanaut,1525728799

1654,"&gt; The interior really isn't all that different from Gare du Nord- soaring ceilings with sections of glass roof and wrought iron supports. The pictures certainly make it seem a bit antiquated (it was built in 1910)- but they are old pictures and it could easily have been modernized just as Gare Du Nord (built in 1866) was.

This is what I was trying to say. The interior is very typical of a railway station and should be possible to be modernised. There are lots of interiors of train stations like that in the Netherlands as well.

Making the comparison to Gare do Nord. Don't you think the scale of the elements of that train station looks better than the one of Penn Station? It's hard to explain, but for me at least it's better to look at. That's why I commented in the first place, the Penn Station building doesn't feel right to me. Maybe it's the sheer amount of columns. Maybe it's that they tried to imitate something and stayed away pretty far from the function of the building. 

Another difference is that the façade of Gare du Nord is directly connected to the interior hall, while for Penn Station it's part of some kind of outside building, but that's not something you'd see from the street level of course.

I looked at pictures of the other train stations you mentioned, and while I'm not a big fan of those buildings either, I'd choose to demolish Penn Station if I had to choose one. All of them combine the inside with the outside better.

I guess it's just this style in general I'm not a huge fan of, while I can enjoy buildings like this hotel.

&gt; People were upset at the time too. And remember- they wanted to do the same thing to Grand Central and that is one of the most beautiful buildings in NYC.

Sure, but all I'm saying is that I understand why they demolished it, especially given the spirit of that time, which you can't deny was a thing.

Free market and capitalism don't necessarily go hand in hand, since capitalism tends to reduce the number of market actors, i.e. successful actors can use their clout to reduce competition to increase their profits.

That's what happened during the late 19th century, when market actors coalesced into a limited number of non-competing monopolies and had to be shattered by force.

1719,"&gt; Thats seriously not true, at least in germany. The major problem with shitty new buildings in the bigger cities exists here because real estate companies can build whatever crap they want and it will still sell because theirs almost endless demand for flats and apartments.

It’s definitely true. Modern construction standards demand orders
of magnitude more investment for compliance. The main  beneficient
being the renter (in Germany) or prospective owner (practically
everywhere else).

&gt; Most people want to live in old buildings because they have high ceilings and big windows, just google flats in germany and you will find that those are usually the prefered ones.

Not by a long shot. High ceilings may look superficially nice but their
effect on energy efficiency is devastating. Renters vote with their wallet.
It’s their call if they prefer the extra meter of distance to the ceiling over
a reduction on the heating bill. The same goes for facades: historicizing
stucco may evoke a warm and fuzzy sentiment when viewed from the
outside. But when given the choice between proper and compliant
insulation or a useless ornament, rationality prevails.

Only the richest can afford to waste their income on non-functional
parts, but then the alternatives to pimping what is essentially a cheap
19th century working class apartment are endless.

1730,"&gt; US broadcast? Is that a joke? I don't know a single person who has an antenna. 

So, decades and decades of active attempts at censorship doesn't matter because of relatively recent tech-movements neutering the FCC through technicalities?

&gt; In any case FCC tried and failed many times:

They have succesfully imposed fines for 'indecency' for quite a long time; which is still a form of censorship. The fact that legal technicalities mean this is increasingly irrelevant in the age of non-broadcast TV and radio doesn't somehow absolve the US government and turn it into a magical bastion of perfect free speech.

&gt; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Byrd

One can always find singular cases to support ones views. For instance, I don't believe that drawing cartoons should be a [crime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Diana) regardless of the content, but the US government apparently disagrees.

The US generally has pretty good freedom of speech, absolutely, but there are more than enough exceptions to it that it's become problematic; more than enough of them to sink the ignorant black and white notions that often pop up in these types of debates of the US somehow being the only place with real free speech (a notion that can only be maintained through an ignorance of both the real dangers to free speech in the US and the actual expressions and protections of it in Europe).

1733,"&gt; The PPP is designed specifically to make international comparisons adequate

Not the way you think it does. PPP does *not* adjust for internationally-traded goods and services. Think of a laptop computer or a smartphone. The price will be the same the world over, more or less. Typically the only real difference is the taxes/import duties that a government attaches to it, but that's not in the control of the selling company. 

What PPP *does* do is adjust for the fact that, even in advanced economies, the vast, vast majority of purchases are of domestic origin, hence the ""international comparisons"" tag. But /r/peacefull_protest is also wrong, because even Portugal has a higher nominal GDP per capita, their nominal wages are in fact not much higher (and in fact somewhat lower on a gross basis).

Furthermore, a larger share of this nominal wage will be eaten up by higher costs.

Finally, housing prices does *not* count as inflation. And Portugese housing prices, especially in big cities, have become silly. ",Europe,/r/europe/comments/8hoqrx/ifm_data_poland_would_be_richer_than_portugal_in/dylnuen/,FriendOfOrder,1525721503

Portugal may be more stable, but it's not untouchable. It's a matter of time, the tourism boom will drop, either because of some bad event or just becoming out of fashion. Something cheaper might take it's place as well.

But instead of focusing on real and sustainable growth, we are turning our country into a tourist resort. And the brains we create eventually leave (yet another gain for richer countries). 

It's getting to a point that it's barely affordable for Portuguese people to live in Portugal, let alone have vacation as well, and for any resort to work there has to be people to serve, and that's what Portugal is becoming. Are you proud of that? I'm not, because we have proved countless times that we can do so much more, particularly in the technology field.

Ironically, I had to leave my country to be able to afford buying a house and spending some decent holidays there. I'm a programmer, by the way, so I could even get a slightly higher than average salary in Portugal.

Also, many Southern European countries are blessed with good climate, which boosts their housing market.

**Sales of Olanzapine per a *schizophrenic* citizen of the US per year=** 2200000000/(325700000*0.005)= $1350.94

1841,"&gt; Contrary to many /r/iamverysmart approaches to style, I believe that total clarity while still maintaining the same level of insight is the toughest and most intelligent thing someone could do

Yes, I'm so glad we moved away from that. In Marx's time, both literacy rates and the price of printing presses were vastly different that today's. 

But one side effect of his writing is that you are forced to comb over it thoroughly, which is what ever writer would want. 

&gt;Marx' and Hegel's style don't really impress me, therefore.

I agree. Hegel's not only influenced philosophy, but greatly influenced how philosophers write. 

&gt;Thanks for revisiting it! It is a tough topic, and the essay is regularly misconstrued to make Marx look bad

An hour and a half well spent. He does look bad if you give it a superficial read.

&gt;but I think it's an early approach to what we call societal stereotypes. It wasn't really a big topic back then and Marx tackled it fairly well I'd say. Of course he ties everything back to his basis theory of bourgeois exploitation etc and you can attack that, of course.

Yes, with the prior context (his feud with Bauer, and his philosophy on bourgeois exploitation), it's obvious what the intent of his writing is. I wasn't aware of his feud with Bauer, and I assumed that Marx had a similar shortcoming that *many* leftist philosophers had about Jews; they were inherently part of the ""bourgeois problem"".

This is regular everyday stuff you experience as you walk on the street. It's okay to primitively think ""that shit ugly"" or ""wow, look at that beauty"" without putting more effort to it.

In fact, that is exactly the thing so many elitists in the field of architecture are missing out.

Before the new building was finished, Parliament took place in this beautiful building (which admittedly was not really big enough). However, this building is a much better example of Scottish architecture.

&gt;standards of modern architecture

That's somewhat my point; modern art/architecture standards are not representative of human aesthetics. Modern design only shocks, there is no aesthetic value. Classical designs are based on mathematics, and natural designs - there's a reason why they've lasted millenia.

&gt;worth a visit

I've been in and seen most of the building, I really dislike all of it: concrete, horrible wood, unnatural angles, etc. If they wanted to do something ""modern"" and representing Scotland, they could have at least done it in the style of Charles Rennie Mackintosh - whilst I'm not a personal fan of his architecture (I think his interior design and decoration was much better), it is preferable to what we have.

The Taxi drivers ripped us off two times by constantly changing price. They had different prices depending on where you wanted to drive. For instance the short trip from the Hotel to the city center was the lowest rate but he always took the highest. I didn’t knew that until someone explained it to me later. 
That all happened while i traveled together with my romanian ex girlfriend, so they also rip off their own people. Thanks to god we left after a week or so. Brasov was a whole different story though. One of the nicest cities I’ve ever seen and definitely the city with the most attractive women I’ve been to so far. 
After all a great vacation. I like the romanian folks in general. It’s just like they need to do something illegal from time to time because reasons.

1935,"&gt;But it is correct, a country that fears their citizens will remove the guns from their hands by all means necessary.

By the way, if you want to fight your government in case its needed (which is what your argument comes down to), you'd need more than just handguns.

You'd need bazookas, tanks, fighter jets, perhaps small nuclear devices, et cetera. You get the point. All those things are not allowed in Switzerland.

Your government, any government, will laugh at you when you stand there holding your hunting rifle.

So the question is, where do you draw the line? And every country draws that line differently.

Your liberal gun law isn't really about defending yourself against the government. That's why the law is limited. You can't own every weapon you want.

&gt;Fully automatic guns are [banned](https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/society/bearing-arms_how-gun-loving-switzerland-regulates-its-firearms/43573832) outside of military purposes, as are most semi-automatic guns that were once fully automatic. 
&gt;
Heavy machine guns, laser sights, night vision features, silencers and grenade launchers are also not allowed for civilian use. 

Stating you need liberal gun laws to fight the government if necessary, is really a non-argument. If that's your argument, you need no gun laws at all. So everyone can buy a tank if he wants to.

And you can't. So according to Mr. Suter's previous statement, Switzerland is a dictatorship as well. Cause you can't own any weapon you want.

Hence the ~~bonnläppar~~ rural population have dug fiber connections themselves and are even less interested in mobile broadband now.

Meanwhile on the subject of normal subscriptions (voice and data) PTS has this to say:

&gt;**Mobile voice and data**


&gt;Sweden had the cheapest price for a mobile subscription including at least 100 
calls, 140 SMS and 2 Gbyte of data per month. That subscription cost SEK 95 
per month with Comviq (Tele2). The price decreased by 34 per cent compared 
with 2016, when the equivalent subscription cost SEK 145.


&gt;PTS’s comparison of Swedish mobile subscriptions (voice and data) shows that 
the lowest price decreased in the 100 Gbyte data category between 2016 and 
2017. In 2017 two operators (Tele2 and Telenor) launched subscriptions with 
unlimited data. The lowest price in that category is at the same level as the 
lowest price for 100 Gbyte subscriptions in 2016.


&gt;The price per Gbyte is strongly related to how much data per month is 
included in the subscription. The more data that is included, the lower is the 
average price per Gbyte. The highest price per Gbyte for subscriptions with 
limited data was SEK 199 (for a subscription with 1 Gbyte), while the lowest 
was SEK 3.5 (for a subscription with 100 Gbyte).

2033,"&gt; So workers are fucking 100% right in not only fighting to keep the working conditions they managed to win in the past, but also to fight for better working conditions. This benefits everyone but management/share-holders, and if they can't deal with cutting down their personal profit margins for the sake of a healthier work environment, then the company needs to be nationalized. And then the working conditions needs to be imposed on all other companies uniformly, once again to benefit safety of flights.

That creates a toxic business environment, business owners have full right to gain more from the company than the workers (per capita). A worker is not risking anything while working, at the end of the month he will get a fixed amount of money that he agreed to and if he does not like that he can walk off from the deal, meanwhile business owners are risking their personal wealth for bad decisions, they are taking bigger risks in their personal wealth. If a company goes under, a worker will get his final pay and thats it. But the owner will lose money, his personal money, but he agreed to risk losing it, because he could gain more. 


What you are suggesting would create so toxic environment in France that there would be no point in create jobs for anyone else but yourself, why should I take my personal money, invest in company, so I could create a job for you and gain less from it than you are, but your are not risking anything at all. 

In the long run cases like this harm French job market, what company would like to invest in France when they can't get any profit from it? 


And don't get me wrong, I do support protests if conditions are truly bad, but when you want more even when you are getting above industry standard benefits then I don't see the reason for your protest other than just simple personal greed. At this point then company will have no other choice but to fire people or increase their business costs that are already higher than industry standard.

People parrot this fact a lot, when it really doesn't have the resonance that they think it does. The Eifel Tower was opposed by a committee of the *aristocratic, intellectual elite*. It isn't comparable to the *public* hatred of modern architecture. In fact, the Eifel Tower was readily accepted by the public, and was adored by visitors; 2 million members of the public attended its opening day. Whereas the Eifel Tower very rapidly became an adored icon, most modern buildings are 50+ years old an still hated. It's really not a valid comparison and I wish people would stop with it.

Would they abandon their investment?

Let me get this straight, you’re saying that Greece was created merely because someone felt that their interests are being threatened in the Mediterranean? So the international outrage in Western Europe provoked by the massacre of Chios never happened? The Philhellenes never happened?

2090,"""We don't build stuff like they used to back in the good old days!""  Usually implies ""they used to build stuff better.""

Nope.

I'm an architect and I just attended a conference on maintaining and restoring historic buildings.  One of the best presentations was by an expert showing lots of building techniques, materials and detailing in historic buildings that we, today, know is really bad for durability.  Some issues come from building in styles from areas with freezing winters and transplanting those styles to tropical or otherwise hot/stormy areas.  But a lot of issues come from building in climates where they get freezing weather, and Stockholm would be an example of such a climate.  

So to answer your question:  I don't know this project specifically, but typically this sort of thing happened because the original construction wasn't particularly durable, so that what was originally built in the 1870s was falling apart (and likely quite literally falling onto people trying to enter/leave the hotel), and the economics of completely re-creating those ornamental details didn't work at that time, so a more simple (and frankly, more durable) replacement was put in place.  Today, they can afford to re-create the original more ornamented facade (and likely it's made with more durable materials and detailed to better keep water out and better handle freeze/thaw cycles so it will last more than 100 years.)",,/r/europe/comments/8hlk9r/the_grand_hôtel_in_stockholm_has_its_ornamental/dyl1po2/,tomdarch,1525700139

But it also has benefits from a board perspective, as parachutes help ensure that the CEO won't bail on the company. Parachutes are only paid when the CEO is let go, not if he hands in a resignation because he'd rather play golf in the Bahamas.

Would you say this is justified? And all the shit started when Albanians wanted to secede from Serbia (Kosovo was never a state, but a region of SFRY). What did the USA do when few of their states wanted to secede? They went to war to stop them. What is going on in Spain with Catalonia? Same thing happened with Baskia region, they led the terror campaign, and no one batted an eye or tried to bomb Madrid to force them to let Baskia to secede.",,/r/europe/comments/8hlowd/on_this_day_in_1999_nato_bombs_the_chinese/dykwmp4/,tevagu,1525692739

2152,"Multiculturalism has historically been a good thing. Societies which rejected foreign ideas and refused to adapt, fell. The most successful empires all embraced new ideas, knowledge and concepts. That's not to say they became the exact same as the culture they met, but they took elements of it, just like they did with all other cultures. Keep in mind that the Islamic world has at varying periods in time been a center of free thought and ideas.

Europe will never become an Islamic theocracy. Muslims from third world countries won't ever be a majority. I don't think we should reject all who seek better lives here. I also don't see us as inhumanely dragging them here, but I do see how circumstances may force them, more so than then coming of their own will.

I do agree with you that fundamentalists and extremists are a problem. By my standards, anyone that puts religion over secular law and liberty, is an extremist. 

Your idea of robotics solving our problems send to me to be reasonable enough a proposal, but I'm not sure if there's really any conclusive studies.

My ideal would be a worldwide social market economy with strong worker protections and regulations everywhere btw.

Cruise tourists also drink and eat. 

&gt; rents, and displace people living in the city centers. 

That's a natural consequence of banning hotels from the city center.  Hotels are nice, high-density tourist accommodations that cater to the occupant's every need.  Once the current hotels cease to meet the demand, local residents take advantage of the opportunity and start to offer their own low-density tourist accommodations. 

If you don't want tourists renting apartments then you need to enable hotels to meet that demand.  If hotels don't meet that demand, your neighbors will.  If you believe that ""displacing people living in the city centers"" is a problem then complain to your regional and municipal governments for their role in creating a local housing market by imposing artificial restrictions on high-density tourist accommodations. 

Take for example Barcelona.  The sheer idiocy of the current government led them to fool everyone into believing that what they described as being a ""tourist problem"" would be fixed if they simply banned the construction of more high-density tourist accommodations within the city limits.  Well, so when these idiots started banning hotel projects the local population started taking advantage and picked up the slack with their low-density offerings.  Now, the same idiots running the show in Barcelona don't want to get caught with the proverbial egg on their faces, and thus decided to pick an escape goat: ad-hoc reservation services used by locals to rent their rooms and apartments, as if a website operator actually forced residents to open their doors to tourists.  Yet, by banning hotels they actually created incentives for local residents to profit from the demand.

I hope we do not see anymore of that but I wouldn't be surprised people perceive the lack of punitive measures as a lack of justice. 

Simply put people in the west today are way too spoiled lacking any real example of violence around them. Most people go around without experiencing any harm for most of their lives.

2444,"&gt;Just a reminder, justice punishments are not vengeance.


That is not exactly true. Justice isn't some modern term that got born from the most humanistic circles where we try to inflict the lowest amount of pain in order to bring back the criminals in society. The role of 'justice' is to take away the burden of vengeance from the individual. Allowing people to self inflict justice can be a recipe for disaster since people often go overboard with vengeance. Also it is possible that relatives do not perceive the revenge as just in turn will go around looking for revenge creating a cycle of murder. The state, taking the role of the vengeful hand is allowed to regulate that. But the basic rule is the same - alleviate and sate the innate need for vengeance from the person that has been wronged.


In that matter: Would you as a father/mother of a child that probably still doesn't clearly understand what happened feel that justice was served? Would agree that the state dispensed a proper amount of justice to satisfy you? If not would you understand if the father/mother takes 'justice in his/her hands'? If in 3 months you happen to be the judge in the trial of the father for the murder of the rapist would you acquit him? Would you be sympathetic to him and understand why he did it?",,/r/europe/comments/8hez12/sex_with_10year_old_is_not_rape_says_finnish/dykneba/,superduperwrong321,1525671979

2453,"&gt;Apart from the well-known repeated rape of virtually every girl and woman unlucky enough to be in the Soviet occupation zones, perhaps the most shocking outrage recorded by MacDonogh - for the first time in English - is the slaughter of a quarter of a million Sudeten Germans by their vengeful Czech compatriots. The survivors of this ethnic cleansing, naked and shivering, were pitched across the border, never to return to their homes. Similar scenes were seen across Poland, Silesia and East Prussia as age-old German communities were brutally expunged.

Czechs slaughtered quarter of a million Sudeten Germans ? Could anyone provide a reputable source of such claim ?

**The joint Czech-German commission of historians in 1996 stated the following numbers: the deaths caused by violence and abnormal living conditions amount approximately to 10,000 persons killed; another 5000 - 6000 persons died of unspecified reasons related to expulsion; making the total number of victims of the expulsion 15,000 - 16,000 (this excludes suicides, which make another approximately 3400 cases.**",Bohemia,/r/europe/comments/8hkvw6/how_three_million_germans_died_after_ve_day/dyknjvx/,Trax1,1525672262

I think that AirBnBs are slightly problematic. If you've got an apartment you should live in it yourself, not use it as a hotel.

People moving to a country (or richer people moving within a country) and thereby driving up the rents is a separate issue from people going there as tourists and not behaving properly.    
  
In the end, the goverment has to make laws and regulation to control tourism to a degree that benefits the country. Lack of those laws and regulations is a local problem, not an international one.

2463,"Although what you said is certainly true and spot on, about the whole 'unique' experience, it actually misses the point of this graffitti.

There are more context specific aspects to what is happening in a lot of places around the mediterranean.

For context I will copy paste my comment from below:

&gt; Airbnb-like business models mean that what use to be limited to hotel chains and some hostels or B&amp;B's is now a revenue stream accessible to every landlord.

&gt; What this means in practice is that the landlords that used to rent rooms in tourist hotspots, are now leasing them only on airbnb, and even landlords that use to rent 2 or 3 bedroom houses have kicked their tenants out for airbnb type business models.

&gt; The people who used to rent those rooms or houses are being pushed to live in the outskirts of town (where tourists would not book accomodation) and being charged 100% (and rising) more rent to be an hour away from where they once were in the city centre.

&gt; On top of this, if you have huge numbers of wealthy tourists throughout the city who's buying power is much higher then the median local, it follows that local businesses can ramp up their prices because there are enough tourists who will pay for it.

&gt; So the city where locals used to live, is now a Veneza-like movie set full of beautiful buldings where no one but the turists and the extremely wealthy actually live.

&gt; The places in the city where the locals used to go and spend their time and enjoyed themselves, have been bought out, boutiqued up, franchised into, places with no soul and with prices that none of the locals can afford.

&gt; This is what happened in Barcelona some years ago. This is the background for the anger and frustration you see distilled in that grafitti.

&gt; This is what will happen in my home town Lisboa in the next 10yrs, if none of the local governance has the balls to curb real estate madness and the wealth inbalance between locals and foreign investment.



For perspective on this situation, to add my anecdotal evidence, I lived in the UK for 9yrs and I've just moved to the Netherlands this past month. I am at a point where I can buy a 2 bedroom house in central Den Haag, but I would still not be able to afford buying the same 2 bedroom house in the neighbourhood I grew up in Lisbon.

&gt;and ending his text with the claim that it is necessary to eradicate such stereotypes and narratives? Right? 

I felt like t read more like it was tongue-in-cheek; Society is only ruled by The Jew^TM because it is organized (politically &amp; socially) in a way that values ""huckstering and money"". 

Basically, capitalism rewards self-interest and greed. The Jew^TM has no legal political power yet has political power, not because of accumulating private wealth, but society turns wealth = power, and values money over everything. Why hate do you hate The Jew^TM ? All society pedestals him, and has created him.

More guns availability does mean more gun violence, but most gun violence is gang-related targeted shootings, domestic incidents, etc. London has recently overtaken NYC in terms of homicide rate, largely due to a stark increase in knife attacks related to gang activity, so less guns doesn't necessarily less deadly violence, as criminals adapt.  

Take the two worst terror attacks in France in recent years as an example of how weak the correlation between the two is when applied to terror plots: Paris attacks- 9 terrorists armed with bombs and military grade rifles (in spite of strict laws intended to make such procurement impossible) killed 130. Bastille day attack - one guy with a rented truck killed 86.

2725,"&gt;Who said anything about easy?

You were the one arguing that village life is somehow preferable to working in an office, yet you didn't really specify why so I assumed it was because you thought it was easier. If that's not the case, then please argue your point better next time.

&gt;Do you think the easy way is always the best way? Can you empirically prove easier is better? 

Build straw man? Check. Attempt to destroy straw man? Check.

&gt;That reason is capitalism

Can you empirically prove that everyone does this because of capitalism? Just kidding, I don't use that kind of ""argument"". As somebody who did live in one such village and who visited many, I can definitely confirm it's not just because of capitalism but also due to a lot of other reasons, for example because people consider city life to be superior since it's more modern, because they think it is generally easier, because it gives them access to a lot of facilities that they lack in the villages, and so on.

&gt;does not imply a rural life is objectively worse than a city life

And this is a point that I have never made. There are definitely pros and cons to both life styles, which is why I didn't reply the first part of your comment because I agreed with the points that you made about clean air and people generally not obsessed with social media (though that is definitely changing).

&gt;Urban living is not without its trials and tribulations as well, but culturally we're taught that the trade-off is beneficial because it benefits a small segment of people for this belief to exist.

Can you please expand upon this idea? I don't think you could have made this point any more vague.

&gt;You're once again presenting cultural values as some kind of scientific fact or truth.

I sincerely fail to see the ""cultural value"" of eating something not because you necessarily want to, but because you don't have a choice.

&gt;You prefer trading money for imported goods in a store because it's what you're used to.

And most of the people living in such villages also trade money for goods, granted not in the supermarket but in farmer markets.

&gt;For starters I believe you are overstating the mortality rate of village-dwellers

This is not something exclusive to Romania, but the mortality rate of people living in villages is generally much higher compared to that of people living in cities *all around the world*, especially infant mortality rates.

&gt;revealing your culturally-based desire to avoid sickness and death at all costs

Since when did basic human desires devolve into ""culturally-based desires"" again? The urge to avoid sickness and death is a universal one, and always has been for crying out loud...

&gt;and to pretend these things don't happen outside of the village.

...and to straw man, since that is pretty much exactly what this point of yours is.

&gt;Whoever said poverty is romantic?

Perhaps idealize would be a better word? The point is that you seem to be talking about something that you have little to no information on, a preconception about village life in Romania that seems to only focus on the positive aspects and unfortunately many of those aspects are ridiculously misinterpreted. Also, when you are called out on these preconceptions you try to justify them by saying that I do not understand these ""cultural values""....despite the fact that I'm a Romanian, I have lived in such villages and also traveled to many others, and you are an American that seems to not have researched this topic very much at all.

Oh the hypocrisy.

&gt;Whoever said village life is poverty?

Considering the poverty rates in Romania...village life IS poverty most of the time.

&gt;acknowledge that not everyone prefers the same way of life you do

An argument that I have never made.

&gt;your preferred way of life is objectively better stand up to much scrutiny.

Neither do your constant straw man arguments.

Instead of constantly abusing the word ""culture"" and every variation of this term, how about you do some actual research on the subject you're trying to debate here?

2735,"&gt;It's not a ""slippery slope"" if you can comprehend that it is the right to owe guns that shall be bestowed upon a person after demonstrating they are fit for such thing, not the other way around.

You are unaware what a slippery slope is. These are endless restrictions which do not end, with more bans or far greater limitations every 5-10 years. This is a fact. They simply do not end. It's a travesty that illegal guns smuggled from Eastern Europe is used as a justification for even more restrictions on legal owners instead of implementing actual border controls.

Unlike other European nations, gun ownership in Switzerland **is** a right. The primary difference is that you do not need to provide justification to own a gun in Switzerland, instead the authorities have to provide justification as to why you cannot own one. Put simply it is a privilege everywhere else in Europe but a right in Switzerland.

These laws are objectively a massive infringement upon Swiss rights and liberties banning the most commonly owned magazine. Swiss citizens voted against more gun control in 2011, it turns out that most of them want to keep their rights and liberties. Who knew? I'm not saying that this right is unlimited, because there are already regulations in place. This however is an egregious violation of said right and Swiss gun owners have agreed to restrictions in the past. Eventually there comes a point where enough is enough and people draw a line against more control.

2810,"Thank you for your text. I really appreciate it.

&gt;It's simply that what Marx represents for you isn't what he represents for us. For us, he represents repression, he represents political trials against the 'state enemies', he represents decades of economic stagnation that left our country that was on the same level as Austria before WW2 in total ruins, he represents the communist regime that devastated and corrupted the minds of generations of people in this country, which is something that we are still recovering from.

I get this. With these dead people, we decide what singular point of perfection we can find in the imperfect whole, which we then tend to reify the whole. West chose to concentrate on Unions and extending voting franchises, East concentrated on justifying the present. I'm sure it feels bad -- I can even relate. Years ago I went to a British museum where there stood the famous photo of Roosevelt, Churchill and Stalin. Underneath it there was inscription: ""these people fought for democracy and for the  right to be free"". I was pissed the whole day and couldn't concentrate on anything else I saw. I still regret I didn't take a photo. I think you're experiencing something similar.   

Now that I remember, I used to know few yugoslavians few years back. They mourned how the wars had destroyed a country that was on bar with any in Western Europe. I have been wondering about it for years, and finally come to the conclusion that when people say they hate communism, they really mean that they hate Russian government. And I can get that. I totally can. There has never been a time where Russia has been a good place to be for the average worker, and it isn't a surprise that 20th century followed the mold.

&gt;&gt;My country isn't even the worst case, just go ask your neigbours in Estonia.

Naming Estonia is probably a bit different to you than it is to me, I suppose. To me it was Stalin trying to restore the Empire to its past borders, which we (Reds and Whites both) stopped with weapons, while in Estonia they tried appeasement and ended badly with them back in the fold. 

So this was something where communism wasn't really the reason, it was the pretense. The whole economic angle was just to keep the countries tied to Russia as strongly as possible. ",Terijoki,/r/europe/comments/8hf6gm/after_the_discussion_about_marxs_birthday/dyjz1ge/,OWKuusinen,1525641981

Spains unemployment rate has been below 10% like 5 years in the last 3 decades. You don't know anything, do you?


If you knew anything you would know that the only reason the Spanish economy hasn't crashed already is because the government has more than doubled, nearly tripled, it's debt in the last decade.


&gt; Those were all contributing factors but not the spark that set the whole thing off.


I can tell you don't understand much about economics. The spark doesn't matter, it's the underlying problems that matter. That's just a dumb statement. ""The problem with the great depression was the stock market crashing.""  Yeah... no.


&gt; if you ever take a single lesson of economic theory in your life, your prof can explain you that in detail.


Well one of us has 2 degrees in economics, one of us seemingly didn't even understand his high school economics.

Do Marx and Engels cross that line? That is to some degree a matter of oppinion, but you should understand why many people feel the line has been crossed. Marx he never called for ""Crushing the cockroaches"" but he clearly identified large social groups that would have to be somehow gotten rid off. And you should see why many consider the mass murder of those groups is just a logical continuation if those ideas, after all even the Nazis only resorted to mass murder once other ideas of getting rid of undesirables had proven impractical. 

Further, his view of social progress involved a lot of bloodshed for the greater good, as he admired the French Revolution long past the time most liberal thinkers had dismissed it as a bloody mistake. He supported British colonialism for the sake of ""progress"" according to his dialectic, in a period when the British were mismanaging their colonies to the point of starvation. Even if you believe in the whole ""ends justify the means"" thesis, this should give you a pause.

All in all, you should see why there's a pervasive feeling among a lot of people that it'd take a considerable amount of mental gymnastics to take Marx's social philosophy without reaching conclusions that are both dark and evil.

No. The real message is: ""If you don't understand who is mr. Navalny and still believe him, we'll show you"". A week earlier there was another mass protest in Moscow, against banning of the Telegram and for freedom of the Internet. No one was detained. Navalny was one of speakers there, [here is a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_aIjg5wWC80). Note that police is not detaining anyone. Because it was a real protest, not staged, it was organized using an official inquiry to close one of main city streets made by The Libertarian Party.  And there were no provocateurs to attack policemen or propagandists to film how kids would be thrown at police and then detained. 

Another recent mass protest was in Volokolamsk city located near Moscow, where a little girl [literally showed the local mayor what they want to do with him](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH5UB2N4_Xc). As you could see, police do not stop her.

During the dry season, the lake disappears, which enables paddling, fishing, hiking or grass mowing in the same area in just one year.

&gt; The lake normally stays on the Cerknica plain for about eight months a year. Water usually spreads over the surface of 20 km2, but at its fullest, the lake covers a surface of nearly 30 km2. When full, Lake Cerknica becomes the largest lake in Slovenia.

&gt; In the area, 276 bird species have been observed – one half of all European species; this is home to 45 mammal species – one half of all European species; 125 butterfly species can be spotted here – a little less than a third of all European species; 15 amphibian species spawn by the lake – nearly a quarter of all European amphibians... Biodiversity of the region is truly exceptional!

3075,"Yo no estoy idealizando nada ni negando que haya problemas en Suecia, sólo pienso que la gente vive algo mejor y que tienen una democracia más consolidada que aquí.

&gt;Perdona pero en suecia no se vive mejor que en España. Prueba de ello es que todos los suecos que pueden se compran una casa en España.

No. Eso es prueba de que con las pensiones que ganan después de haber trabajado en Suecia o bien con el dinero que ganan con empleos bien pagados conseguidos después de escalar en su carrera laboral en Suecia se pueden permitir de forma muy cómoda casas que a ellos les resultan baratas y a nosotros caras o normales. También es prueba de que a todo el mundo le gusta el clima cálido y de que España tiene muy buenas campañas de marketing turístico. Los ""expats"" del N de los pirineos disfrutan de todas las ventajas de vivir en España y de casi ninguna desventaja.

&gt;Pero aquí en suecia lo único que es mejor que España es la estabilidad laboral. Yo hablo con otros Españoles y todos llegamos a la misma conclusión. En España se vive mejor pero en suecia tenemos mejor estabilidad laboral. Créeme que aquí lo único que he ganado es en tranquilidad, porque la mitad del país esta vació. Apenas hay gente, al menos no tanto como en España. Es como si vivieses en un pueblo. Pero por lo demás, no, no vivo mejor, ni mucho menos. Todo es caro, muy caro apesar de que los salarios son altos, en general pagas mucho dinero por cosas que no lo valen.

Todo es muy caro, pero como has dicho los salarios son más altos. Y te parece poco la estabilidad laboral? Que no estoy diciendo que España sea un país tercermundista, claro que la diferencia de la vida entre dos países desarrollados no es muy grande, pero aún así existe y eso no se puede negar. Por no hablar de que tú supongo que habrás ido a Suecia con tus estudios terminados a buscar un trabajo. Cuánto dinero en educación te habrías ahorrado en Suecia? Y qué calidad tendría esa educación en comparación a la que se recibe en la mayoría de institutos y universidades de España? De nuevo, no sería una diferencia abismal, pero habría una diferencia. ¿Qué hay de los derechos laborales? Y de la protección medioambiental? Te parece poco?

&gt;Los indices de percepción en los que salen los países nordicos suelen ser en general, percepción. Pero la realidad del dia a dia es diferente. 

Si en el día a día ves corrupción no crees que la percepción de la misma tendría que ser mucho más alta? Me recuerdas a la gente que de verdad se piensa que España es el país más corrupto de Europa.

&gt;Lo de la vivienda en suecia es una locura. Especialmente en un pais que esta casi vacio por que lo población es pequeña. 5 y 10 años para encontrar apartamento estable no es ni mucho menos razonable.

Como he dicho, no niego que Suecia tenga problemas. Aún así me parece más grave tener que mudarte a la otra punta de la ciudad por no poder pagar el alquiler o tener que vivir en casa de tus padres porque no encuentras un trabajo que te permita emanciparte.

&gt;En España tenemos una burbuja de alquiler pero es por culpa del exceso de turistas y que mucha gente no se puede permitir comprar.

Te parece poco? A mí no, desde luego. Y más teniendo en cuenta que el modelo económico actual que tenemos fomenta el crecimiento del turismo masivo, aunque los habitantes autóctonos de las ciudades turísticas sufran. Además, el alquiler no sólo sube por eso, sino porque mucha gente se muda a las grandes ciudades a estudiar o trabajar y no hay viviendas que cubran la demanda, mientras que las Castillas, Aragón y Extremadura se vacían cada vez más.

&gt;Lo que pasa es suecia es pura corrupción.

Me gustaría saber más del tema. De verdad. Por qué encontrar pisos cuesta tanto en Suecia y por qué es por la corrupción? Especulación? Burbuja inmobiliaria?

&gt;Aqui en suecia a pesar de los altos impuestos están teniendo problemas con el sistema sanitario porque no tienen suficiente gente para atender a los pacientes

De nuevo, no niego que en Suecia haya problemas.

&gt;Creeme, esto no es un paraiso.
&gt;Yo era de los que pensaba como tu. Pero el dia a dia en suecia es muy diferente a como lo pintan en esas estadísticas.
&gt;Me hace gracia la gente como tu, siempre idealizando a otros paises. 

Es que ni creo que sea un paraíso ni idealizo a Suecia lol. Simplemente pienso que países como Suecia tienen menos problemas, o menos graves, que España. Ya está. También soy consciente de que España sigue siendo uno de los mejores países del mundo para vivir y que es mejor que muchos otros países desarrollados en muchos sentidos.

3076,"Sure, but use case differs. ""Actress"" can be used casually in English, but in Finnish you don't generally make a difference between actors and actresses unless there's a reason to. You could add *-tar* or *-tär* to these two example cases to make it female gender specific. Actor/Actress: *Näyttelijä -&gt; Näyttelijätär*, for Dancer: *Tanssija -&gt; Tanssijatar*.

Royal titles (kuningas, kuningatar) have gender-specific words very similar to other languages. But often cases these are different titles altogether, like witch: *noita* and wizard: *taikuri*. There are probably posher words than *dancer* to use in ballet that is gender specific if it's important, but I'm not knowledgeable enough, I tried googling, at least I know we have Finnish equivalents to cavalier: *kavaljeeri* and dame: *daami*, but like English and French these are not specific to the context of dance.",Finland,/r/europe/comments/8heq64/gender_of_the_european_countries_in_finnish/dyjm74v/,RassyM,1525628289

For the sake of an argument: if you ""just"" convince them so that they believe it's a good idea. Kids are easy to manipulate.

And as the Finnish requirement for rape is that violence or threat or violence is used, or if the person is in such a state they are unable to refuse (unconscious, disabled, in panic), then the intercourse is rape.

So if the child in question was not coerced with violence, with threats of violence nor was the child in a state of fear which rendered her unable to say no, then by law the intercourse is aggravated sexual abuse of a child, not rape.

3109,"That's actually how i feel about the Agenda 2010 created by Schröder in Germany. Many changes created under him were rather bad on a personal matter, but for the country they were required.

The changes to the employment policy created a new industry working with low skilled low cost jobs. Bad for everybody who is stuck in them. But at least the people are working, which is better than be unemployed. From my own experience, working at least some job will bolster self confidence and and will look ok on a resume when applying to better opportunity. Better than trying to explain why you weren't working at least. Without the shit job i did before, i wouldn't be at my current position as a civil servant. (Low pay, but great benefits and job security) 

The same with the unemployment benefits, which were changed with Hartz 4. Shit changes for the individuals but good for the larger population. In my first contact with the job agency my experience was just pure shit. I felt like the lady was really bummed out by the fact that she couldn't really sanction me because i didn't ask for social security money if i didn't fulfill everything that was required of me. But one of the job offers that she gave me, which i was required to apply for, resulted in an offer of employment for different job. I would have never applied for the first one if it wouldn't have been required.

Now that i gain a look in from the other side (i don't work for the job agency, but now hear their tales during lunch), these requirements under the threat of sanctions are their last way to force people to move their ass. On the topic on universal basic income they say that there would be no measure left to get people to even try looking for jobs anymore. 

Yes Schröder was a POS who sold out to Putin, and his changes did hurt a lot of people. But Germany went from called ""The sick man of Europe"" to the opposite.

3187,"It is not. 

Sex with children is a custom (even if criminalized, which it often isn't) in many African and Middle Eastern countries. In some of their states you can buy them as slaves - the only places on earth this is still true - you didn't think ISIS invented that custom out of thin air did you?. Usually also a woman going 'unattended' is expected to be used for sex because that is how low the threshold is for their society to regulate men's behavior. Same with children. Many MENA people fetishize white women and children *specifically* (look up the uncensored search engine queries on porn websites from certain countries like Kuwait if you want to feel horrified) - so many of the men coming here expect sex from them, they think the nudist beaches, western media, all implies casual sex all the time from whoever.

This is a cultural misunderstanding. The UK police report two or three gangs who are native predators - but nearly hundred times as many who do the same thing but because they target the 'white whores' - so they are classified differently although the actions are identical. 1% of the population is responsible for nearly all the rape. It's like industrial production instead of a lone creepy man trying to get away with a crime - that's why the right wing are gathering support in Europe. I don't care how left wing you are because if your family is affected by such people you'll be ready to unleash German Shepards into the streets - that's human nature.

&gt; military leader and general of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA), as well as a one-time ally of Nazi Germany and one of the organizers of the Halych-Volhyn Massacre.

&gt; In Germany in November 1941, the Ukrainian personnel of the legion was reorganized into the 201st Schutzmannschaft Battalion. It numbered 650 persons who were given individual contracts that required the combatants to serve for one additional year.

&gt; Shukhevych’s titles were that of Hauptmann of the first company and deputy Commander of the Battalion, which was commanded by Yevhen Pobihushchyi.

&gt; In spring 1943, the OUN-B's UPA launched a campaign of murder and expulsion against the Polish population of Volhynia, and in early 1944 against the Poles in Eastern Galicia. This was done as a preemptive strike, in expectation of another Polish-Ukrainian conflict over the disputed territories, which were internationally recognized as part of Poland in 1923.",Russia,/r/europe/comments/8he14t/poland_consigns_communistera_monuments_to_dustbin/dyj9nyp/,AIexSuvorov,1525613204

From Latin colōnia (“colony”) in Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium, the official Latin name of the original Roman settlement at Köln.  

&gt;[In 50 AD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cologne#Roman_Cologne), the Romans founded Colonia on the Rhine and the city became the provincial capital of Germania Inferior in 85 AD. The city was named Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium in 50 AD.  

As d1rtyd0nut said, it is a proper noun, so it doesn't have a meaning as common word, though it does have an origin related to ""colonia""(=colony)

3288,"&gt;Sure, it might be bad in the short term. But it's certainly not some catastrophy that will rek the UK economy. Which is essentially the dogma on reddit.

It certainly will have more than just short term influence on the UK economy. For example, it's very well possible that the Brexit may become one of the reasons for long term unemployment. The Brexit can very inflict severe damage on for example, the financial sector in the UK.

&gt;It's nothing compared to having to pay for the Greece-like failure of Spain and Italy in the coming years.

Speculation. The greek bankruptcy had a very specific set of circumstances, which are not given at the moment. Whether they're going to be given in the future or not is beneath my knowledge. I know of no credible institution that anticipates anything like this.

&gt;If every other modern country can do it, i'm pretty sure the UK can manage.

Sure it can, with a lot of effort and money. Both of which I don't see a lot in the UK these days.

&gt;Clearly it's not. Hence Brexit won the vote and Nigel Farage has become a household name across all of europe, perhaps even the world.

&gt;I know you really want it to be political suicide, but it's not.

a) Being known throughout the world as a major twat, isn't exactly a good thing.

3289,"No.. actually it was only slaves women and children who could not vote in ancient greece.. and only an idiot would roll back to that... we are past slavery and denying women in government. (If you argue that slaves were a large part of ancient greece... Today we have new technologies, such as AUTOMATION, which will destroy livelihouds under the current capitalistic system, rather than empower workers under the proposed system I am addressing)Does not mean there were not lessons in that democratic system where the voices of the working class were heard.
Obviously you can improve on it. Same way Marx’s work would influence rather than dictate.

Does not make Marx any less relevant. The notion presented, is not strictly any of these things... You just asked for a working example of what it was based on. But to create a better template, is not just about, 'rolling the clock back'. Its about utilising the abundance of great minds in politics up to today. Economist Yiannis Varoufakis, again presents great work for a working model.

It would be... simultaneously Libertarian since it prioritises empowered individuals (Hayek influence). Marxist since will confine the division between capital and labour, and global kenysian. But above all else, it will be an authentic democracy. And yes authentic democracy with the event of large corporations is at risk. They push their directives, they bankroll politicians, and vie with each other to elect the one they want through social engineering. Kinda Ironic how the Americans cried fowl play when putin did it, but say nothing when large corporations eg. gun companies represented by the NRA, are so entrenched in it...

3322,"&gt; I don't think we should blame a fictional character for anything

mate Jesus was an actual person lol. Whether he was the son of God or not is debatable, but his existence is a historical fact.

&gt; blame for some of those could be put on the church of Christianity

The Church and Christ are not the same though, just like Marx and the Comintern (closest thing to a church I think) aren't

&gt; Although I find it telling how you use Christianity as your example for terrorism, not a certain other religion that seems to have a much, much bigger problem with it - too politically incorrect, perhaps?

Focus on what I'm saying, not in implying things. I didn't mention Islam because I know fuck all about it. You could build an argument around it, no doubt, but I'm not able to do it. I grew up in a Christian family going to church and in a culture formed by Christianity. I'm trying not to talk nonsense so I pick examples that I know some more.

&gt; Hardly, they didn't advocate for a violent worldwide revolution to instate an economically unviable system.

I get your point, but I don't think this is the issue brought up in this discussion. I think people blame Marx  for the evils of Communism because he's the most famous communist of all time (probably). Had it been someone else, people would talk about them. If we want to be pedantic he didn't really advocate for it, he simply stated that this is mankind's destiny. Either way, I get what you mean and that's a fair point.

&gt; Whataboutism at its finest

I'm pointing out inconsistencies in this argument. Not denying the crimes of communist regimes or the suffering it created. If you blame Marx for Holodomor, should you blame Friedman for modern starvation ? No, we shouldn't blame either. That's my point.

&gt; A liberal democracy is not perfect, but it is the least bad system we have tried so far.

I perfectly agree with you on this. What I dislike is the fact that people seem to deny the positive heritage we have in modern society from Communism. We have unions, workers' rights, paid holidays, public healthcare and education partially because of Communism. I don't want to live in the Soviet Union, but I recognise that they were responsible for many positive things we have today as well as many negative ones.

Very few areas have actually china towns, majority of cities see the Chinese live amongst the English and are often newer immigrants. The china towns we have were in a way forced to be segregated a century ago. The Chinese were forced to live in those areas so they had no choice but to make the best of what they were given.

As to your second question, no, there is no desire to regain these territories. They have been lost. Europe's ethnic and cultural map has been constantly changing through history. Germany had technically been expanding eastwards for centuries in a process called ""Eastern Settlement"". The World Wars have mostly reversed this process as Eastern settlers were driven back into Germany by force. However, the german ""Lebensraum"" is still larger today than it was in 700 AD for example

3381,"Both Marx and Nietzche were missinterpretated and the results from both influences are totalitarian dictatorship that both of them didn't wanted and were against. Marx added fuel to what he believed would be the natural outcome of capitalism in developed industrial nations like England and Germany, with repressed workers blasting their economical repression. And that has nothing to do with Lenin and Mao did in their no industrial undeveloped countries. The very same we can say about Nietzche and the repressed Germans following Hitler on the supposed ""Nietzche philosophy principle of 'superior men'"". What such leaders do is to interpreted philosophies based on their own world view and interest to adapt it to their own goals, instead of the original philosophers views and goals. And it happens all the time even today, like people calling pos-modernism as marxism when it is obviously not. Or when people blame Marx for the existence of dictators like Lenin and Mao.

Therefore while those in my family who were adults when they fled retained their specific dialect to a certain extent, those ""eastern"" dialects largely weren't passed on to those who fled as children. My grandparents who spent the larger part of their childhood in Bavaria ended up speaking standard German, and so did my father, though with a slight franconian lilt.

3405,"Sorry for the late response.

I think it's important to say that even the conservatives in Spain argued these last years that when ETA ended, the dispersion policy should too. Because, again, *it's a war policy*, and not a justice related one.

Now that it ended, some of the same ones are like ""lol jk"".

In that sense, that's certainly not as we saw in this thread (e.g. ""fuck them"", and then the only redditor who idientifies themselves as basque being downvoted). There's divide in society regarding what should be done. The basque president himself, who isn't by any means a basque nationalist, is in favor of ending this policy, and the only thing preventing parties from doing so is how they care about their votes.

&gt;[...] Everyone involved knew what ETA was doing and was actively supporting that.

ETA was way more complex than just a terrorist band. It started in Spain during the fascist dictatorship —and they in fact killed the 2nd to the dictator back then, ironically contributing to the switch to democracy.

It also represented one of the mainstream choices for basque independentists for decades, and as such you could kind of grow into it. Meaning that if you were born basque and of certain basque feelings, supporting ETA in some way was one possible choice. Not probable, but having sympathy for that cause was rather common. Mind that the State had death squads, too, at some point, so it was in fact a war situation.

In that sense, I think it's important to remember ourselves that in unfair situations, in both reality and fiction, we call terrorist bands 'the resistance'. That's certainly not the case here, but it's as well not as easy as putting these people in the basket of other kinds of terrorism like the religious one, as their cause was —and still is— a legit one.

&gt;I do consider vengeance an important part of justice,

Then you must know you're in the other end of the pole of what are considered modern justice systems.

&gt;Nothing of value is lost if we take away the terrorists from these communities. 

Wrong.

This hurts society, in fact, as it's considered overkill by the ones in power.

Also we need to talk scale here. When i say this i don't mean majority of people but minority of people. Difference here is that in eastern europe % minority of people is WAAAAAY smaller than % minority in western europe or US.

here is fun part, 20% of US social scientist believed themselves to be marxists in 2006. Undoubtedly that % rose because we see very clearly change in academia today. Western Europe is different but social science is more or less following US social science especially in countries like Sweden.

3494,"&gt;Why is this so neglected in European history?

Largely because the Papacy, and as a result the rest of Catholic Western Europe ended up not recognizing their completely legitimate position as the Roman Empire to bolster their own Imperial goals.

Following the coronation of Charlemagne in 800 A.D, the Holy Roman Emperor was the true Roman Emperor in the eyes of the Catholic world, the Roman Emperor in Constantinople was merely the ""King of the Greeks"", which was a term that was deeply insulting to the people living there.

Then the renaissance and enlightenment happened, which wanted to assert itself as different from the Middle Ages, which they saw as a dark age in order to return to the glory of antiquity. To enlightenement historians, the history of the Eastern Roman Empire was a decadent, superstitious, oppressive age of decline and nothing of value.

3529,"The reason is mostly a sum of maaany things. Some people already mentioned it, but I'll try to expand it a little bit (talk about Spain. I don't know the situation of Portugal). Since the invasion of Napoleon, the colonies in America started their fight for Independence, and given that Spain already had to fight a war against the French, it was hard for Spain to keep the colonies. Actually, after the French invasion, during the kingdom of Ferdinand VII, Spain started losing all of their colonies (except Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Philippines, but we'll get to that later)

Also, you have to take into account *lots* of things that happened during the 19th century. On the one hand, you had the Carlistas wars. To make the long story short, Ferdinand VII died without a male heir, so he changed the law before dying so that his Daughter, Elizabeth II, could be the new queen. Ferdinand's brother, Carlos de Borbón, didn't recognize this change (since according to the previous law, because Ferdinand didn't have a son, his brother Carlos should be the new king), so he started a war against the ""isabelinos"" (those who supported Elizabeth). This just meant more reasons for Spain not to be able to keep their colonies.

And trying to summarize, Spain had a lot of different political systems during the 19th century that just contributed to more instability. The First Spanish Republic was established, and didn't even last a year. At some point, Spain even had to find a man from the Italian aristocracy (Amadeo de Saboya) to be the new Spanish king after Elizabeth fled the country. 

Finally, Spain lost their last three colonies in 1898 after a war with the US. And trying to summarize, just during the begging of the 20th century, Spain had the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera, the Second Republic, which had lots of political tension between the left and the right, for many different reasons, which ended in the Spanish civil war and then 40 years of a dictatorship.

Well, unless they have really bad family relations, of course they care somewhat. But ultimately it's not their problem. Young people also care about problems that the older generation are facing, but not strongly enough to actually do something about it.

The reality is that each demographic group primarely sees its own problems as the most important and the demographic group that is currently hit most by the housing crisis simply isn't a big part of the electorate. It's not even all young people, since the youngest voting group, i.e. people from 18 to cca 25-26 largely don't think about buying a property yet, they more so focus on studies, finding their first job, figuring out what they want to do in life and they are simply not settled down yet and so they don't want to tied down to a specific place by bying a property there.

So it's really more so people currently in the 25-35 age group that are hit and that's just not enough people for the politicians to give a shit.

3619,"That's not true. Most languages have a difference between animate and inanimate nouns that is somewhat relevant to certain words but one aspect of a gender system is that it is strictly required and an undeniable attribute of the noun.

That means that if you use it wrong in Basque, it will sound very wrong to a native speaker. In English, I don't even remember when the distinction is relevant (I think it was something with ""that"" and ""which""?).

It's like saying English has a neutral/masculine/feminine system because it has gendered pronouns.

Japanese has neither a plural nor a m/f/n nor an animate/inanimate gender system but it can express all the concepts that you can find in languages that have those things. Does that now mean that Japanese has those concepts? No. It has a suffix that indicates that you're talking about more than one thing but that's optional and not inherently part of the noun. It has a way to say ""he"" or ""she"" and somewhat also ""it"" (Japanese pronounce are an open class of words so you have a lot of pronouns) but it's not part of the noun. Nobody is wondering ""Do I have to use X or Y as a pronoun for this loan word?"" because it's irrelevant. Japanese also requires you to use a different form of ""to be"" (in the non-copula meaning of ""to exist"") for people than for other things but this might as well be a politeness thing, like literally everything else in Japanese.

And the opposite is also true. In Japanese, you cannot build a grammatically correct sentence without also making a social statement. There are different pronouns and verbs for different politeness levels. Not just ""polite"" or ""impolite"" but ""I'm equal to you"", ""you're above me"", ""I'm above you"" and then this goes into detail with things like ""I'm above you but we're still friends"" vs ""I'm above you and you're garbage to me"" (just like ""cunt"" will turn some heads in the US, the biggest insult in Japanese is a word for ""you"" that rich people used for their slaves/servants). Even things like not dropping words from a sentence can be insulting. It's like somebody is offended because you didn't drop a pronoun in Spanish.

This system is undeniably an inherent part of the language. It is impossible to not use it (just like gender systems and plural in the prestige form of most European languages).

In English, you can also express politeness. But it's not that relevant to the grammar. It's simply a different way of saying the same thing and everybody has a different way of saying it. If you talk to your boss, you better fucking say watakushi as a first person pronoun and you also better fucking add -sama or AT LEAST -san after his or her name. If you don't have to do this, it's because your boss is chill. Not because of your personal preference.

When talking about grammar, we're not talking about what can be expressed but what is encoded in the very fabric of the language. And the distinction between animate and inanimate nouns is simply not one of those things in most of Europe.

So yeah. Basque, as a non-IE language spoken by some mountain people in Spain that managed to hide for long enough so that the blood thirsty IE tribes with a superior complex didn't manage to snatch them and either kill them off or 100% assimilate them into their culture and society, is different. So different, in fact, that we know of an earlier stage and one major change of the language and literally nothing else.

There's no such thing as this, people who require visas for entry need a separate visa for both Britain and Ireland, but recently that's not currently required if they're Chinese or Indian. 

A Chinese or Indian national can visit the other country so long as they enter first the country which issued the visa e.g. an Indian with a UK business visa is free to make a trip to Ireland without an additional visa and vice versa if the visa's Irish issued, but a Russian with a UK tourist visa would need a separate Irish visa to travel there.

3636,"Animacy comes from the fact that certain things have different autonomy than other things. There are languages that have much more genders (or noun classes) than 2 all based on animacy. The highest one is adults, then children (and lightning is also part of that category, usually), then rivers and pets, then cattle, then stones and trees and so on. 

The 2 way distinction is simply this but very simplified.

Common/neutral is more arbitrary. It comes from the very senseless m/f/n distinction where masculine and feminine collapsed to one. As far as I remember, in Dutch, ""man"" and ""woman"" are common but ""girl"" is neutral because it has the same root as the German word for ""girl"" which makes it neutral through grammar. 

The same thing happened with most Latin based languages where the masculine and neutral gender collapsed to one.

The UK should, as a free and sovereign nation, be able to negotiate a trade deal with the EU without giving up their borders and having all the United States of Europe shoved down their throats.

3725,"I posit that this observation has more to do with the funding structure of academic research. This practice is certainly not limited to Sweden (I had very similar experiences in other countries), and there is a good reason for them in most cases:

Let's say you lead a research group that is working on a number of projects. Some of your staff may be funded by departmental budgets (e.g. lecturer positions), some may be funded by various research grants (potentially from different granting bodies with different regulations on what you can spend specific money on); Let's say your group has been working on a multi-year complex research project. At the outset you hired a junior researcher, postdoc etc. to work on this project and paid their salary from grant X. Now grant X is ending (grants typically last from 2-5 years), but the project is going well, you are happy with the person who is working on the project, and you want to continue pursuing this project. 

If the person working on the project also wants to continue their work on it, you need to find different funding to pay them. Since you can't pay your staff from grant X anymore, the person may need to officially apply for a 'new' position to be employed from a different funding source. Obviously, a person working on a research project for two years successfully has such familiarity and experience with the subject matter, that they can not be easily replaced by an outside candidate, even if this was the most qualified candidate in the world. 

So the 'job posting' is not really a job posting as much as it is an administrative requirement with a foregone conclusion, as there is really no new position to be filled. This is also the reason why these postings are only advertised as broadly as required, the requirements are often obscure or very specific, and people are comfortable 'deciding' on a 'candidate' 2 days after the posting closes. 

In general, my experience has been that when hiring people to a genuinely new position (e.g. starting a new project, recruiting a new lecturer, junior faculty etc.), people tend to be much more cautious and diligent in screening for suitable candidates, since the cost of hiring an incompetent person to such a position is considerable (e.g. an unsuccessful project may seriously hamper your future access to funding).

This is not to say that I deny the existence of corrupt practices completely, they certainly exist. But I would venture to guess that the vast majority of cases follows the above pattern. ",,/r/europe/comments/8h92xw/swedish_universities_are_rigging_their/dyisg84/,rgh85,1525578193

3764,"&gt;I think one of the issues with English foreign language learning is that we are not taught the grammar of English in any detail. We are taught how to identify a noun, verb and adjective but how the pieces fit together is not explored. So suddenly you're learning a foreign language for the first time at the age of 14 and the teacher is using these new grammar terms you've never come across., so you've got to pick up the grammar of your own language and that of the new one. 


Yeah very true. I think this plays a role as one of the (many) reasons English speaking people don't learn foreign languages often.


Once you can start basically communicating in a foreign language it is so much easier to gain experience and learn more. But for English speaking students they almost always don't break through that first barrier because the grammar of the languages they are taught is so much more complicated than their native grammar to the extent they aren't really prepared to deal with many foreign grammar concepts.



The problems seem to be flipped for people learning English as a second language. It's much easier to learn to competently communicate in English but hard to become fully fluent if that's your goal because of how massive English vocabulary is etc.

3818,"The whole language is constructed assuming each noun has a gender. Verbs have endings specific to the gender of the subject, plural forms change depending on the gender. Nouns assume different forms depending on the role in the sentence (word order doesn't matter because of that), and to know how to change nouns to indicate which role it has in a sentence - you have to know it's gender.

This system makes for very short sentences, and allows us to use pronouns more and still be specific with less words. The downside is more complex grammar rules. Example:

""Jasiek kłócił się z Anią. Rzuciła talerzem w okno, aż pękł.""

it means:

""Johnny argued with Annie. She threw a platter into a window, so [hard that] the platter broke.""

But word for word it would be:

""Johny argued self with Anny. Threw platter in window, so broke.""

Notice how much information is missing because we ignored the endings. We no longer know who threw and what broke.

""She threw"" is one word ""rzuciła"", and because of the -a ending we know it refers to Annie and not Johnny. It also encodes tense of the sentence. Similarly ""pękł"" is ""it (male) broke"", so we know the platter broke and not the window (which is neuter and would be ""pękło"").

On the other hand Polish is completely lacking articles, so we have the situation reversed - why specify a/the, when I don't care :) Remembering to use articles is one of the biggest problems for Slavic speakers learning English (apart from the insane spelling).",Poland,/r/europe/comments/8h8f0n/gender_in_european_languages/dyim6yp/,ajuc,1525570572

-Avram Iancu and his bunch did commit mass murder. They are responsible for the death of thousands of innocent civilians.

-For the record *if you want to know the truth* Hungarian chronicles built on literature not on facts. The first mention of Romanians were present before the Hungarians is from a gesta (namingly the [Gesta Hungarorum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gesta_Hungarorum)), not a chronicle. Gestas were written to tell a story in an entertaining way. Since these stories had mythical elements and built on legends, rumors and everything ad hoc available, it was expected from the author to add to the story to keep the overall storyline coherent. Because of that and because the gesta was written about the Hungarian conquest hundreds of years the conquest happened nothing can be taken seriously without further evidence.
To know how unreliable this is as a source: the author did not know about the Avars, Moravians and Franks yet they were present at the time of the conquest. A ton of important names were replaced by him with made up names despite contemporary chronicles mentioned them. He also made up a Hungarian prince by simply giving him a popular name of his own time. He mentioned once the conquest happened a knight tournament was held which was again a popular thing of his own time. In fact knight tournament's were probably unknown before his time.

By his time Romanians were present in the country which needed an explanation, thus he wrote they were present already in the conquest. However contemporary sources of the conquest and of the following hundreds of years don't state anything like that, which implies he did not copy this explanation from somewhere but made up by himself.

The gist is that it's an inherent *feature* of capitalism that wages will go up faster for a few people while they stagnate for the majority of workers since it is in the interest of the system itself to create this divergence.

&gt;Marx argued that, in accordance with the labour theory of value, capitalist competition would necessitate the gradual replacement of workers with machines, allowing an increase in productivity, but with less overall value for each product produced, as more products can be made in a given amount of time, meaning that economic output would increase, but real wages would stay stable, because the input of human labour stays the same.

It's also contrary to approaches such as trickle-down economics (which postulates that growth for the rich will translate to everyone getting richer).

In *this context* however I can't tell you what exactly the idea was behind bringing it up, probably the concept was understood as a deliberate attempt of ""Marxist parties"" to make society poorer or something similar.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/8h7heo/british_attitudes_towards_immigrants_of_different/dyig3zq/,rEvolutionTU,1525563326

I've had to copy and paste this comment a ridiculous number of times now because the myth keeps being peddled

----

&gt; It's in fact a quote from the article he (Andrew Neather - former advisor to Tony Blair) himself published in 2009 in The Evening Standard, 23rd October, titled:

&gt; [**Don't listen to the whingers - London needs immigrants**](https://www.standard.co.uk/news/dont-listen-to-the-whingers-london-needs-immigrants-6786170.html)

&gt; Three days later (26th October) he had to publish a follow up because certain papers and the Tories themselves went full conspiracy. In fact Neather is now doomed to writing about immigration for eternity, year after year in case you want to read his latest thoughts, because the conspiracy continues to be peddled from time to time.

&gt; ----

&gt; Here it is:

&gt; &gt; [**How I became the story and why the Right is wrong**](https://www.standard.co.uk/news/how-i-became-the-story-and-why-the-right-is-wrong-6739051.html).

&gt;&gt; **There's an old maxim among journalists that you shouldn't let yourself become the story.**

&gt;&gt; As the Evening Standard's long-serving comment editor, I'm mostly happy to commission others to write on these pages and let them take both plaudits and flak.

&gt;&gt; But when I find that not only have I become the story, in the row over Labour's immigration policy, but that my views have been twisted out of all recognition, I have to respond.

&gt;&gt; I wrote here last Friday that, in the wake of the Nick Griffin row, we had to be honest about immigration and the benefits it has brought.

&gt;&gt; I also wrote of my disappointment that ministers have shied away from this debate, a point I illustrated with an account of the shift in immigration policy almost a decade a go.

&gt;&gt; As a ministerial speechwriter in a former career, in 2000 I penned a key speech for the then immigration minister Barbara Roche, which mooted changes to make it easier for skilled workers to come to the UK.

&gt;&gt; That was based on a sensitive report on migration by the Prime Minister's Performance and Innovation Unit.

&gt;&gt; Multiculturalism was not the primary point of the report or the speech. The main goal was to allow in more migrant workers at a point when - hard as it is to imagine now - the booming economy was running up against skills shortages.

&gt;&gt; But my sense from several discussions was there was also a subsidiary political purpose to it - boosting diversity and undermining the Right's opposition to multiculturalism.

&gt;&gt; I was not comfortable with that. But it wasn't the main point at issue.

&gt;&gt; Somehow this has become distorted by excitable Right-wing newspaper columnists into being a ""plot"" to make Britain multicultural.

&gt;&gt; There was no plot. I've worked closely with Ms Roche and Jack Straw and they are both decent, honourable people whom I respect (not something I'd say for many politicians).

&gt;&gt; What's more, both were robust on immigration when they needed to be: Straw had driven through a tough Immigration and Asylum Act in 1999 and Roche had braved particularly cruel flak from the Left over asylum seekers.

&gt;&gt; Rather, my sense was that the nervousness came primarily from No 10.

&gt;&gt; According to my notes of one meeting in mid-July 2000, held at the PIU's offices in Admiralty Arch, there was a debate about whether the report should be published by the PIU or by the Home Office: the PIU didn't think the Prime Minister wanted his ""prints"" on it.

&gt;&gt; From Tony Blair, the man who took us to war in Iraq on a lie - and who later fired the faithful Roche on a whim, months before she lost her seat thanks to the war - I don't find that particularly surprising.

&gt;&gt; Perhaps the lesson of this row is just how hard it still is to have any sensible debate about immigration.

&gt;&gt; The Right see plots everywhere and will hyperventilate at the drop of a chapati: to judge by some of the rubbish published in the past few days, it's frankly not hard to see why ministers were nervous.

&gt;&gt; The Left, however, will immediately accuse anyone who raises immigration as an issue as ""playing the race card"" - as the Government has on several occasions over the past decade.

&gt;&gt; Both sides need to grow up. A diverse society that welcomes immigrants works.

&gt;&gt; We've got one right here in London. Why is that so hard to discuss?

When reading these communist-apologizing garbages I remember the recent article in one slovak daily. [The author](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jana_Be%C5%88ov%C3%A1) writes about a conversation she had with her english friend Nick who is in 70s and how with love he remembered his visits to Soviet Union back in the days and when the conversation gets heated, as she is anti-communist and actually remembers what these ""great ideas"" have done, he just said ""well, you in periphery had it hard, but in USSR it was really good"". She continues the article with video she saw from US where one Confederacy-wielding guy was arguing with black guy during some protests aginst some confederacy statue and when black guy asks why does he have that flag he says ""because its my family history, my family fought under that flag and owned farm under it"". On which the black guy asks who worked on that farm and confederato says ""they did. They were poor. Do you have any idea how expensive slaves were back then?"" and as he says it, he realizes what a dumbass sentence he just said and just moves away. When Nick said that, she got that image in her mind.

NYT and ""liberal"" western medias like you who glorify this bloody regime, go fuck yourself.

Hell even in economics today we have big trouble. When we work with productivity or GDP data in underdeveloped countries we sometimes don't even know if we can rely on them or if they're comparable. 

While the mathematical foundations of statistics and science were being developed in those days, the economy was not yet wired up to provide data, and physicists did not have particle accelerators and computers to process vast amounts of information.

4010,"&gt;It was the Austrian economists F. A. Hayek and Ludwig von Mises who resisted this idea most forcefully. In their landmark critique laid out in a series of papers written from the 1920s through the 1940s, they concluded that socialism must fail. In modern economies, hundreds of thousands of enterprises produce millions of products. Even with the most sophisticated computer technology, managing such large numbers would be far too complex for an administrative body trying to allocate resources. Modern economies, therefore, are too complex to plan. Without markets and prices, decision-makers will not know what is scarce and what is abundant. If property belongs to all, what rules should those who manage assets for society follow?

4019,"&gt; People have occasionally said that Germany has a somewhat risk-adverse business environment.

Could you perchance clarify what you mean by 'risk-a[d]verse business environment'?

If you mean to say that, generally speaking, people are less likely to take a risk in business, I would disagree for obvious reasons: There is no way you could possible build a first-world economy which has been around since the days of the industrial revolution if nobody takes any risks. 

However, if you were to say that in general, Germans are fare more likely to mitigate those risks, insure against them and often go to (almost comically) great lenghts to contain them, I would agree. 

There's a reason why the savings rate traditionally is absudly high in Germany. There's a reson why Germans tend to favour government bonds and savings accounts over stocks or even mutual funds. There's a reason why Germans tend to over-insure everything ten times over and why our insurance companies are among the biggest money pools in the world. And lastly, there's a reason why the traditional German accounting standards (HGB) tend to *understate* a company's assets on the balance sheet when compared to, say, US-GAAP or IFRS: the latter are geared toward the company's shareholders ('how much is the company worth?') whereas HGB is geared toward creditors ('is the company able to service its debt?').",Europe,/r/europe/comments/8h7heo/british_attitudes_towards_immigrants_of_different/dyi9omv/,ColourFox,1525555623

If their plan closes the N-Ireland border, there's  no deal because the EU will turn that plan down, if it keeps the border open the government will have problems with the Brexiteer faction in government, the ERG and the DUP.

4113,"I believe the U.S. has more long term benefits for immigrants, whereas in Britain it's more of a short term thing.

Many wealthy South Asians already have familial or business ties in Britain, and wealthy grade schools teach British English and culture, hence many already wealthy people move to Britain. This is why South Asians have less of a ""poor, stupid immigrant"" status there, because they already speak British English and already have ties over there, and are usually quite wealthy as well. In fact, in Britain South Asians are referred to as ""Asian"", and East Asians are called ""Orientals"", whereas in America East Asians are called ""Asian"" and South Asians are usually just called Indians or something. Goes to show that South Asians are just seen as already more integrated over there.

Here in the states, our immigrants are usually the ones who didn't come from extremely wealthy families, hence little to no ties to Britain, however, because of strict immigration, ours are usually more educated than the ones who go to Canada. However, our immigrants usually clump up in ""homogenous"" ethnic communities (Jackson Heights, NYC) and usually speak Bengali or whatever to each other, rather than English. 

But these immigrants worked hard to get here, as opposed to the ones who just got into Britain through ties, and they raise their children to make better people of themselves, so these children usually become the ""wealthy Indians"" we see, because they grew up around families with the ""immigrant struggles"" and with a large emphasis on good family standards, so yeah.

So, I think, because the immigrants in Britain tend to already be rich, they're not generally seen negatively. Whereas in America they come here poor, but they end up making their ways up. Idk, this is just a pattern I've noticed, idk whether or not its based on actual statistical evidence though.

As for the different nationalities within South Asia, idk, I feel like they're treated more or less the same here and in Britain, although I believe Bangladeshis and Indians would have more British ties than Pakistanis, hence they're seen as already more ""integrated"" there than Pakistanis. 

And of course there are exceptions. There are South Asians who come to Britain with nothing, and there are those who come to America with high paying salaries just waiting for them, but I'm speaking in terms of the general majority.",obesity and school shootings,/r/europe/comments/8h7heo/british_attitudes_towards_immigrants_of_different/dyi3s7t/,whatevenisthiswtf,1525548441

4115,"Many people from Eastern Europe think that ""exposure"" will change the attitudes of Western Europeans.

This is actually very wrong.

We've had ""*exposure*"" for a long time and our attitudes remain stable. 

I live in a small German town with about 7000 inhabitants. A few years ago, we've had a ""feud"" between members of a traveling Circus and members of another Circus in our town that made regional headlines when they clashed.

We've also had beggar gangs being carted in, then going door to door with signs in hand. I've called the police on them when they showed up at my door. The policeman on the phone told me that many people had already called.

Two years ago, I saw a begging child in the Christmas market of the neighboring town. Also alerted police to that.

Yet I have nothing against Roma or other traveling people. And I'm not alone in that. The general attitude here is between annoyance and '*Meh*'. People here are much more on edge regarding the (German) arsonists currently on the loose (some burning barns, some burning cars). People here were also much more on edge when the Albanian mafia tried to take a foothold in regional football.

The thing is: We had the same attitudes towards Roma here too, but that was 50/60 years ago. Elderly people tell about how there was much more hostility towards them back then.

It is kind of frustrating to see Eastern European redditors here (I'm not talking about you, but more generally.), often claiming ""You Westerners are so naive"" or ""You don't know these people"", when in reality, *we've been there and we just progressed out of it*.

PS: Another thing people have to realize about Germany specifically is that every criminal organization in Europe at some point has had the thought ""Germany is rich, why don't we try our luck there?"".

4124,"This isn't true for Dutch especially when Belgium is  included.

Essentially the story for Dutch is that the more you go upward the least significant the distinction between masculine and feminine still is; in the North in the spoken language it has completely merged and in the South it is completely distinct with different articles and everything. In Belgium and Brabant Spoken Dutch firmly is still a three gender language.

As far as the standard language goes it is also a three gender language though it is mostly based on Northern Dutch the basic story is that in the nominative case masculine/feminine are identical but the genitive case masculine/neuter are identical but the genitive case is very rare and except for one construct which goes in plural where the distinction doesn't matter anyway it can always be replaced by just using ""van"" (of); I read a linguistic analysis which concluded that 95% of the time even in writing people use ""van"" and only in 5% of the time a genitive.

The _actual_ situation in the spoken language is slightly more complex in that a subclass of feminine has emerged if you will which could be called transparently feminine in that it's a bunch of derivational suffixes which always produce a feminine noun and as such it becomes morphologically clear that this is feminine and doesn't have to be remembered on a word per word basis but the productiveness of the dative case as a purely prepositional case following exactly _one_ preposition has remained in all forms of Dutch and it is essentially only used with these feminine nouns (which are also disproportionally common with the genitive) and this isn't even a literary thing but constantly done in spoken language and intuitive even to speakers whose dialects no longer make the masculine/feminine distinction.

Apart from that an obsolete prescripted standard which is now abandoned also mandated that personal pronouns be used in concord with the grammatical gender of the noun but that is seldom done but still done by some sources like some political parties write their language in this style. In all dialects of Dutch relative and determining pronouns still follow the grammatical gender of the noun but those do not distinguish masculine/feminine in the nominative and only in the genitive again so that distinction is also rare.

But even in the literary language the genitive is an incomplete case while _in theory_ it is a full case with all possible forms in practice a lot of forms are highly obscure and essentially never used even though they are still intelligible to all speakers because they appear a lot in literature from before the 1950s when the genitive was strongly prescribed by teachers over ""van"". So while in theory any Dutch speaker can read ""de glimmen spieren eens Turksen Olieworstelaars"" (the shimmering muscles of a Turkish oil wrestler) it's unlikely to ever appear and a lot could not even correctly form it but a double genitive like ""één der taken der overheid"" (one of the tasks of the government) is more plausible to actually occur in written and even spoken language in part because ""overheid"" is one of those transparently feminine nouns whose -heid ending reveals its status as being feminine.

Apart from that a note on most slavic languages is that they have further subdivided masucline into two genders typically called ""masculine animate"" and ""masculine inanimate"".",,/r/europe/comments/8h8f0n/gender_in_european_languages/dyi3v1p/,geile_zwarte_kousen,1525548534

It's more of a case of the more you go north the less relevant the masculine/feminine distinction becomes.

Apart from that a _very_ relevant part of modern Dutch grammar are the subset of feminine nouns often called ""transparently feminine"" because their ending betrays their gender. As in any noun that ends on -ing, -heid, -nis, -tie, -schap and probably a bit more. In particular they still have a productive dative case which is isolated in usage purely as a prepositional case of one single preposition.

Essentially in modern spoken northern Dutch those and only those nouns are used like ""ter informatie"", ""ter vergiffenis"", or ""ter wederopzegging""—that construct is never productively used with a masculine, neuter, or opaque feminine noun and technically it's the dative case.",,/r/europe/comments/8h8f0n/gender_in_european_languages/dyi422g/,geile_zwarte_kousen,1525548765

In Croatian, we would say ""John je pao"" and ""Jenny je pala"". The verb has different forms depending on gender.

For things which are not humans, each word uses some gender (masculine, feminine or neutral). For example, apple (jabuka) is feminine. So we say ""jabuka je pala"" for ""an apple fell"" as we would say for Jenny.

4218,"&gt; If you're a Brit and you hate/dislike most foreigners, but at the same time you care about not being seen as a racist, who are you gonna ventilate your frustration on? Eastern/Central Europeans of course. This doesn't mean you only dislike people from CEE, you might as well dislike Pakistanis, Indians, MENA people and others but you won't say that openly.
&gt; 
&gt; As a result, it might look like there is a disproportionate amount of hatred towards Eastern Europeans in the UK, when in fact, they are just the easiest target. 

That's a fair point, but in the end, if racism/bigotry against folks from CEE is more socially accepted to express in public than does make a difference in the real world.

Marx was an idiot who wrote an idiotic book which didn't understand history, economics, politics or society, which called for the butchering of millions of people in violent, worldwide revolution, and which led to a century of economic thought which caused mass starvations, labour camps, dictatorships and worse.

FUCK YOU if you defend Marx. 

Socialism and communism been tried. They didn't work. Get over it.

Marx was not some kind of leading intellect critiquing the circumstances of his time. MARX NEVER EVEN VISITED FACTORIES OR WORKING CLASS NEIGHBORHOODS.

4240,"&gt; What people dislike is the economic side-effects of the large number of Poles moving here

You're whitewashing that. I've seen a number of Brits on this board whining about 'polski sklep'. I've never seen that in Germany, where I live, nor have I heard other people whine about it with non-trivial Poles and other EEs (Norway, NL etc).

Also, there have absolutely been racist/xenophobic attacks and to try to deflect that as saying ""oh it's just about the economic sideeffects"" is pushing it. There have been stories about people hearing someone talking in Polish and then attacking them. Let's see how you try to spin that. You're in denial. 

&gt; this subreddit continually treats the UK as a cesspool of racism, when it's anything but.

'Cesspool of racism' is too strong, but I certainly don't see the kind of attacks on EEs in either NL or Germany. And I read German media everyday. Or do you seriously believe that German media - not exactly known for being far-right - would cover up attacks on EEs?

Just because UK does have a problem with xenophobia doesn't mean that every British person is a racist wanker. But there is a problem you have, and to say it's just ""about economic side effects"" is giving yourself a massive cop-out.

For example Croatia is not shown with separate borders from Hungary, yet its situation within the Kingdom of Hungary was similar to Hungary's situation within the Habsburg Empire between 1700-1867. Checking out other regions as well, it seems this mistake also happens elsewhere, so the mapmaker wasn't consistent with drawing borders.

However this part I do not agree with:

&gt; If you look close, the mapper never put a border between between Principality of Transylvania and Hungary in the north, looking like Transylvania was part of Hungary all the time, even tho for most of the time it was not.

&gt;Principality of Transylvania under the ottomans (...) is shown with no border

The Turkish occupation lasts roughly from the 3.9 second  mark to the 5.9 second mark. During these 2 seconds, there is only one short flash at around the 4.9 second mark when Transylvania is missing its northern border (probably a graphical error). All the remaining time, there is a clear border between Transylvania and the other parts.

* Lithuania - 15.6% GDP, unemployment has risen from 5.8% in 2008 to 17.8% in 2010
* Latvia - 16.1% GDP (in case of Latvia, their property bubble collapsed just months before world crisis began), unemployment has risen from 7.7% in 2008 to 19.5% in 2010
* Estonia - 15.4% GDP, unemployment has risen from 5.5% in 2008 to 16.7% in 2010

What happened in Lithuania is that government quickly substantially slashed public salaries/pensions/other expenditure/increased taxation. Businesses followed with reducing expenditure. On TV PM/President were saying crisis will become even more worse so tighten your belts even more each day. This caused a huge loss in GDP very quickly. As I understand governments of Latvia and Estonia did similar. 

It seems such approach caused crisis to end more quickly than in other countries, so in 2010 situation was the worst but already started stabilizing and in 2011 we were back to growth.

Overthrowing a government might sound like hard and dangerous work but it's probably very easy - in comparison to the effort required to replace it. Most 'replacements' are just replacing the heads of state and some employees, not the apparatus itself. To fully comprehend the function of a state, just one department - it might prevent you changing it once you know everything - but that's the scale required - little wonder so many people fall on radical and unlikely to work plans.

process is destroyed.

To show the superior efficiency of free enterprise a simple argument appears to suffice. In a capitalist economy, as we have said, people are free to form workers cooperatives as they wish. If, then, such cooperatives promoted efficiency, why would they not supplant capitalist firms through the force of competition? If market socialists correctly judge the benefits of their system, efforts to establish it appear unnecessary: the market will accomplish the task by itself. If, on the contrary, capitalist institutions flourish in a free economy while cooperatives occupy only a minor role, is this not prima facie evidence that market socialism fails to work?

Still I think you get Peterson wrong. He doesn't believe that all these people are aware of being in a combined movement. He says that there are general things in common, which he brand neo-marxism and postmodernism, and he think those ideological movements are part of people's identity. There does exist postmodern authors and they do get teached out in universities. I always remeber my literature teacher, saying similar things about postmodernism. Many of the neo-marxist ideas also exists, as equality of outcome, which probably won't burn down society, but are still very wrong IMO. You have to be able to make broad abstractions to talk about culture. I am more worried about the people refusing to take part in the debate.

4368,"It's really hard to escape a missile when you don't know it's been fired until there's a couple seconds left before impact.


With modern AAM range, the jet with a 50% missile hit rate still wins against another with a 50% missile hit rate but a quarter of the detection range, who can't even know he's being engaged until the missile's closing in and turning on its active seeker. 

While that fighter is doing its best to escape the incoming missiles, the F-35 is free to do whatever he wants (like turn around and run away), still undetected. If he used all of his missiles, he just has to press a button on his throttle to datalink the other jet's info to an allied fighter. That fighter won't even have to turn on his own radar to fire a missile at him.

 Seekers have improved even more than countermeasures. It's also really hard to spoof a sensor that's only a few kilometers away from you. And anyway, that argument only works in favour of the F-35, because its counter measures and EW suite is significantly more advanced than every other fighter. It also has way better sensors to detect and locate incoming missiles and help the pilot use the most out of its countermeasures and perform the best defensive maneuvers to escape that missile.",,/r/europe/comments/8h43fi/will_germany_and_france_develop_europes_first/dyhrrmn/,Kryg,1525534619

4430,"\-Transylvania was inhabited in majority by romanians from the 18th century. \(It has not always been Romanians made the majority\)

\-Germans were not against Hungary in 1918, also since you mentioned legitimacy keep in mind Transylvania was divisible to ethnically homogenous and evenly mixable regions, yet no non\-Romanian representatives of Transylvania were invited to the assembly of Alba Iulia to vote about the union of Transylvania with Romania.

It was 1919 when the Germans turned against Hungary for numerous reasons including the Hungary they used to live in no longer existed, neither the monarch who they should have stayed loyal to, the Decree of Alba Iulia promised autonomous rights that they pushed for anyway \(which turned out to be unkept eversince\) and the Romanian army invaded Transylvania by that time.

Just so you know Austria has been tried its best to stabilize the status of Austrian remnants beyond its border \(South Tirol\). Hungary has been doing the very same civil mannered way. I am sure Hungary's neighboring countries like Romania will have the dignity to acknowledge the will of its native Hungarian minorities since these countries were formed by advocating to fight against nationalistic oppression in the name of equality. Maybe these are not big expectations from democracies past 19th century nationalist era.

\- Hungarians gained legitimacy by the acknowledgement of 10th century European great powers as it was the way according to contemporary ""international law"". Both the secular \(Holy Roman Emperor\) and the religious \(The pope\) great leaders of Western Europe acknowledged them, furthermore even the Eastern European great power \(Byzantine Empire\)'s leader. This acknowledgement was gained by diplomatic steps, foundation of a state and importation of Christianity.

Since you deny that Romanians migrated to Transylvania, meaning you believe they have been living there since antiquity despite no conclusive evidence from a 500 years period following that era, and growing contradictions of the topic, I want to address; Hungary was not only legitimate, but it gained its legitimacy by the successors of the Roman Empire \(both Eastern and Western\).

Edit: Despising Trianon is valid. The time when ignorance and nationalist oppression happened was in an era, when successful state-entities imposed the model, and the idea of the time encouraged it. (Also note that despite the atrocities, Hungary was the first in Europe to come up with law to protect its minorities.) In comparison the time when the Trianon decision was made Wilson's 14 points and human rights in their modern interpretation already existed. Besides the Hungarian society reached the point to resign over the lands that were not inhabited by Hungarians and make a fair agreement over the borders. Yet the neighboring nations took advantage of the Hungarians civilized manner, invaded territories that's population had nothing to do with them and continued to impose the very same (if not harder) nationalistic oppression policy which by this time was also deprecated, making only chauvinistic arguments to support it.",,/r/europe/comments/8h5pnt/1000_years_in_10_seconds/dyhlpp2/,sgsgdark,1525526857

https://www.reddit.com/r/HistoryAnecdotes/comments/5948ex/napoleon_demonstrates_that_you_should_never_be/

&gt; In the nine days between receiving the appointment and leaving for his headquarters in Nice on March 11, Napoleon asked for every book, map and atlas on Italy that the war ministry could provide. He read biographies of commanders who had fought there and had the courage to admit his ignorance when he didn’t know something.

&gt;‘I happened to be at the office of the General Staff in the rue Neuve des Capucines when General Bonaparte came in,’ recalled a fellow officer years later:

&gt; I can still see the little hat, surmounted by a pickup plume, his coat cut anyhow, and a sword which, in truth, did not seem the sort of weapon to make anyone’s fortune. Flinging his hat on a large table in the middle of the room, he went up to an old general named Krieg, a man with a wonderful knowledge of detail and the author of a very good soldiers’ manual. He made him take a seat beside him at the table, and began questioning him, pen in hand, about a host of facts connected with the service and discipline. Some of his questions showed such a complete ignorance of the most ordinary things that several of my comrades smiled. I was myself struck by the number of his questions, their order and their rapidity, no less than the way by which the answers were caught up, and often found to resolve into other questions which he deduced in consequence from them. But what struck me still more was the sight of a commander-in-chief perfectly indifferent about showing his subordinates how completely ignorant he was of various points of business which the youngest of them was supposed to know perfectly, and this raised him a thousand cubits in my opinion.

&gt;[…]

&gt; He reached Nice in fifteen days. When someone made the rather otiose point that he was very young, at twenty-six, to command an army, Napoleon replied: ‘I shall be old when I return.’

At the 4 second mark the Ottomans invade Hungary, and the country is divided into: at the middle Turkish occupied part (notice the southern border disappears), at the east Transylvania which was semi-independent (it has separate borders, but has the Turkish colour) and at the west Royal Hungary, which was occupied by the Habsburgs (hence the Austrian colour). 

Later as the Austrians liberated the country, all of Hungary changed to Austrian colours. The map is not wrong.

&amp;nbsp;

EDIT: to react to the edit of the comment I replied to: he questions why is the name ""Hungary"" there during the times it wasn't independent. Other country names which are also constantly on the map yet they weren't always independent (many weren't independent for most of the time): Croatia, Bosnia, Bohemia, Wallachia, Moldavia, Ireland, Estonia, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, etc.

Also the border of the so-called ""Great Hungary"", that is, the Hungarian Kingdom was more or less constant, regardless of who occupied it. Of course, if we go back to the early Middle Ages, drawing hard borders as if it were the 21th century is not correct.

4849,"When I was a eurokid in the 70s and 80s, ""American"" was practically a synonym for ""better, bigger, smarter"". When I started engineering school, emigrating to the US still seemed a wise career strategy indeed.

Then, a number of things happened.

The Big Bang of course was the implosion of the USSR. Soon enough I had friends and colleagues from all over Eastern Europe. Berlin and Budapest became places to be. The European Economic Community, which had just morphed into the European Union, quickly gained new members and a new importance on the international stage. Europe was once again a continent of tremendous opportunities.

China became to emerge as a manufacturing powerhouse. Other formerly Third-World nations were stabilizing and developping at a steady pace.

Oddly enough, the tipping point for me was the Clinton-Lewinsky affair. America became less of a beacon of liberty and more of a Petri dish of petty politics.

Then came W and all what ensued. America was now two steps behind everyone else.

4851,"I acknowledge my mistake about the amendments. But, Nixon started the Drug war. He wanted to keep the blacks and hippies in check. This was nothing new. Drug criminalisation has been used to punish minority groups since the 1800s e.g. opium became banned because the Chinese were using it, cocaine became illegal because blacks were sniffing it, and anti\-cannabis laws sprang up because Mexicans were smoking it.  

[Blacks and whites use cannabis at the same rate, yet blacks are far more likely to be arrested.](https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/1114413-mj-report-rfs-rel1.pdf) It's obvious that it's easier for the authorities to punish poor people, who might not speak English and are poor. Often uneducated, they are unlikely to know their rights and also unable to make use of the best lawyers to defend themselves. It's not that they are worse offenders. 

Furthermore, America simply fails on dealing with drugs. Drugs are not treated as a public health issue \(unless it's opioides used by affluent housewives\) and the goal of the prison system is just to punish people, offering no rehabilitation. I encourage you to read about the German prison system. American prisons are an absolute embarrassment. The amount of the population in prison is outrageous. The fact that prison reform has not happened suggests to me that if it did, some rich donors would become unhappy. Prisoners cannot even vote \(wonder why\) when locked up!

Maybe because of how the world was in late 19th century Europe, Victorian England in particular where Friedrich Engels explored how terrible the class society was there, with child labor in coal mines and all the unfairness and cynicism  Charles Dickens wrote about. It didn't seem like there was any progressive way out, until Social-Democratic parties were getting stronger. Eventually the masses stopped having any patience or trust in progressive change in Imperial Russia so the revolutionary Bolsheviks (Majority) completely took over what the progressive Mensjeviks (Minority) might have accomplished in the country.

 And at least the French Revolution brought about mostly positive chance in society there from that point, despite the initially bloody purges, repression of clergy and then the rise of Napoleon and the Napoleonic Wars, there more liberal views about sex and religion in France compared to other countries in the late 19th century, to the point that the poet Oscar Wilde, convicted for homosexual acts at home,  exiled himself to France.

4929,"&gt; War on Drugs has militarised the police force and was put forward only to target the blacks and other communities.

This is quite possibly the greatest misrepresentation of the facts. The War on Drugs was implemented as a measure against perhaps the worst of all demerit goods, drugs. Keep in mind that President Reagan graduated with a degree in Economics, not racism. He recognized the cost narcotics had brought upon American social life and economic efficiency. I would agree his actions were in failure, but this is due to the economic reality of narcotics more than anything else.

Reagan did not act to unleash suffering upon minorities under the guise of anti-narcotics enforcement. He acted in order to save minorities and others from the suffering CAUSED by narcotics.

&gt;...the Fourteenth Amendment specifies that it's acceptable when used as punishment for a crime.

It would seem you need to brush up on your Constitutional law. **The Amendment outlawing slavery was the THIRTEENTH, not the FOURTEENTH.** To refresh you, the fourteenth amendment gives all persons born or naturalized in the US citizenship. 

You are correct that the thirteenth amendment permits labor as punishment for crime but you seem to think this is related to the current state of prison statistics when you say:

&gt;Now minorities get disproportionately locked up in for-profit prisons for drugs because of harsh minimum sentencing laws,...

I will make this clear, **our justice system is set up to make the possibility of being wrongly convicted insignificant compared to the number of rightful convictions while still allowing for the expedient due process of law.**

In other words, if you have committed a crime, you have a very low of being convicted for one.

I am not going to berate you with the facts regarding the disproportionate figures surrounding the rates of homicides burglaries, and thefts as they relate to race, as I suspect you already know them, and they frankly meme'd to death these days, but just keep them in mind while you ponder that last statement.

In regards to your statements about state-run prisons, [it's been shown that state-run prisons tend to fare about equally in regards to quality-of-life and cost-effectiveness](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/es_20161021_private_prisons_economics.pdf). Also, keep in mind that [only 7% of state prisoners and 18% of federal prisoners reside in private prisons](https://www.aclu.org/issues/mass-incarceration/privatization-criminal-justice/private-prisons)

Nowadays the emotional aspect about the regions is largely absent from the mainstream. Of course that wasn't the case in the past. Immediately after the war, the regions were seen by many as [contemporary maps showed, to be parts of Germany ""under foreign administration.""](https://i.imgur.com/LZ7dPBd.jpg) This was in part a political move since millions of Germans from those regions had moved further West into Germany.

Still, eventually those memories were dulled by the winds of time. Moreover the huge issues of reunification of East and Western Germany showed how gigantic a task it was to rebuild a country even where both pieces were mostly made up of ethnic Germans who wanted to come together.

these are just some examples from reputable news outlets.

come on man ffs you know nothing.

those outside the schengen, including outside europe.
are subject to the countries own border control.
you are wrong on all fronts.
Hungary is losing its status as a democracy, dont say it is one.

Orban isnt just doing what his voters wants, he does this because its good business for him
once this crisis ends, and we are seeing the end of the tunnel by now.
he will lose votes and know hes gonna get fucked by the EU.
he doesnt want it to end.

you also didnt address my other arguments btw, curious.
shows you have no answer for them.

dont flip this one western governments.
if everything were up to the people, the majority of us would vote to end all migrations coming from EE and deport all EE.
and the east would throw another bitchfit.

you also didnt address my argument that the west is turning its back on the east.
our moderates are done with Poland and Hungary, and our right wingers still hate them.
everything that Hungary has done is shor term gains.
they will lose a lot longterm.

and before the east joined the EU, every single illegal immigrant was subject to the same rhetoric you use.
and they should still be.
just because the EU wills it, does not mean there arent any borders anymore, thankfully there still are, but weakened.

every single point you made was wrong.
except for the polling bit, that was correct. now look up how many in the west also want EE in their countries.",The Netherlands,/r/europe/comments/8gzskb/orbán_no_eu_money_should_go_to_migrants/dygxfwi/,MightyAdam,1525483577

Yes, its traditional.

I believe, this will be the closest election in 16 years. Economy is in the worst it's ever been. Erdoğan's actions are becoming less popular. The last referendum was very close and 3 big cities, (İstanbul, İzmir, Ankara) voted against Erdoğan in that. And for the first time in our elections, the opposition shapes the media. Opposition makes big moves (parties helping each other, alliances, etc), so they get a lot of media attention, and even bad attention can be good as we saw in US elections. In normal circumstances, I'd easily say this will be the Erdoğan's last election. But I can't because Erdoğan has total control on media and government. He will not go down easily, a dictator would do everything he can to save his ass. 


Either Muharrem İnce or Akşener will get to the second round against Erdoğan. We still have nearly 2 months, so this period will be very important for attracting the undecided. It's apparent that this elections will be very important in Turkey's future and I hope this time everything goes for better.",Turkey,/r/europe/comments/8h0qn7/turkey_opposition_names_rival_to_erdogan_muharrem/dygyej1/,Aenovejo,1525484683

The Lesson is about a teacher who kidnaps two of his unruly students and forces them to learn using a nail gun as a motive, and Inbred is about a bunch of teens who get kidnapped and tortured by a bunch of Inbreds in a remote area. 

The Retreat is probably my favourite and is about a couple who go to this island to rekindle their dying relationship, and find a guy washed up on shore who convinces them there's a zombie virus outbreak and can't go back. The whole time you're wondering whether he's being truthful or not while they're all stranded on this remote island 

Another great film I have to mention is the Norwegian film [Troll Hunter](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1740707/) - its a found footage format which I love and is about a bunch of documentary makers who discover these giant trolls in the wilderness and join forces with a ""troll hunter"" who is hired by the government to kill them and officially secret, but wants to come out and share his story with them for their documentary.

But that said, the issue here isn't the government restricting free speech unambiguously. The government is actually moving to PREVENT non\-government student groups from engaging in deplatforming as they say THAT is a violation of free speech. The deplatforming itself isn't government censorship. It's student protest and that's why I think this is a slippery slope argument. Because we're saying ""Students can't engage in a form of protest that makes dangerous and factually incorrect information at these venues difficult to put forward because it will stifle freedom of expression"" but those protests themselves are a form of free expression and the right to protest is also a valuable right.

Ok, [this here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkfT0XGrpn8) is an ok video to follow. Ingredients listed as you follow the video:

1, Potato (1 kg in general, but the video shows less)

2, water to cook it in

3, salt

4, Cook it until it's soft (not an ingredient, I know, but just so you can follow the video)

5, Flour (0,4 or 0,5 kg flour to match the amount of potatoes; NEVER pour the whole amount at once, go slow and mix it gradually)

6, Fat (from pig)

7, 1 onion

Follow the rest of the video (the end, sour cream is being poured over it)

5188,"That kinda factors in that... we should of course also try (and shouldve been doing that for ages) to stabilize and develop 3rd world countries so their people wouldnt feel the need to try and seek their fortune in another place. But that was hardly done, instead Africa was seen as a dumping ground of bad quality product sthat couldnt be sold in the west. 

You can find tons of articles of people trying to create businesses in those places that are just outcompeted by the cheap european stuff we throw at them. I remember two stories, one was of a (iirc) Nigerian woman that got together with other women and bought cows to produce milk which worked great at first. Then europeans came with their milk powder, which was lots cheaper and put them out of business, they had to slaughter the cows and ended up with nothing.

Another story was that of a tomato farmer also from western africa, who could not compete with the cheap tomatoes imported from Europe. Since we in europe only (well, mostly) want Grade A prodcus where does the rest go? We dump it in Africa. That farmer in the end migrated to italy where he worked as a seasonal worker on a tomato plantation.... 

The way we trade with africa makes it very difficult for them to generate wealth, generate jobs and lead their countries to the future because the only thing we (the west) care about is short term profit when dealing with them. I hoped the refugee crisis would change that approach but the only thing we changed so far was paying gatekeepers in Turkey, Libya etc, not address the root issues. 

So I say: Lets at least help those that brave the voyage and risk their lives to come to us to best of our abilities. And try and lobby for policies that change the approach we have towards Africa....

I`m not saying there is an easy or good way to fix all this shit that is going on but the way the issue is approached we are only making it worse. ",European Union,/r/europe/comments/8gzskb/orbán_no_eu_money_should_go_to_migrants/dygsdb6/,Slaan,1525477624

5251,"&gt; I imagine many are serving life sentences though. 

Well, there's no life sentence in Spain. Many ETA terrorists are already free, like the [woman](http://www.elmundo.es/espana/2017/06/13/593f7d84e5fdea711c8b45a6.html) who was convicted for 23 murders. She spent 23 years in prison. In the following years and decades, the majority of them will leave prison.

&gt; Not much point in reeducation and reintegration if you're coming out in a coffin.

Even in the case that by age (very old), someone is going to spend what remains of life in prison, the constitutional principles still apply. And the penitentiary activities dedicated to reeducation and reintegration still apply to them. Think of a case that is not uncommon: there is a legislative change and the penalties of X crime are reduced. Given that the favorable penalties apply retroactively, that prisoner would have to leave prison immediately by law. If this man hasn't been reeducated properly, it can be really dangerous. Things like this (unexpected reduce of prison time of ETA prisoners) have happened, for instance after the Parot doctrine change.

5259,"&gt; movement of people with anti-nuclear, pro-homeopathy style opinions

Those may intersect somewhere but usually don’t go together.
Irrationalist views (homeopathy, Waldorf schools etc.) are indeed
widespread even among the establishment but I’m not convinced
it’s worse than in neighboring countries.

The anti-nuclear sentiment is mostly supported by facts though:
I personally don’t share the preference for the kind of renewables
that are touted as the future over here (solar mostly), but it’s
definitely a position with economic, technological and systemic
advantages. Another important factor is the public distrust against
those corporation that would obviously be in charge of constructing
new nuclear sites: Time and again, they left the taxpayers with
a immense bills of secondary costs that entrusting them with
even more public funds for gigantic construction projects will
not sit well at the next elections. Cronyism in politics goes in
the same vein and preventing funds being spent on a few
mammoth projects is quite an effective counter strategy.

This controversial measure was adopted in 1990 by the Spanish Minister of Justice, to pressure terrorist to negotiate peace. During Aznar government, some ETA prisoners were brought back to Basque Country after negotiations. This ""distancing"" measure was considered illegal and unconstitutional by many jurists, besides negatively affecting the penitentiary principles of reeducation and reintegration. And the majority of the Basque society are against it. But some argued it could be beneficial to force ETA to negotiate.

The problem with this discussion, as you can see here, is that people get driven by emotions (*fuck those terrorists*, etc.) and it's difficult to have a strictly rational and legal debate about this. Terrorists must fulfill their long sentence in prison. But from a legal point of view, it's very difficult to argue they should also fulfill a second *extralegal* sentence (that also affects innocent people, like family). Seeing recent declarations by Basque President, it seems this situation will end soon, tho.

(Lebanon being the best example of this by far) Obviously putting money into those countries to help them cope is something we should do, but considering how many they have, its not so much to ask Europe, the richest region on the planet, and a region that is much bigger than Lebanon, to take in the very small amount of refugees (percentage wise) that get here.

Populist ideas are dangerous because they prey on desperate minds - for instance white dudes feeling like their whole world is ending because they might have to act like decent people and not benefit from their assumed dominance, or white people who perceive immigrants as savage interlopers who will rape their women and take their jobs. They prey on fear and offer an easy scapegoat and solution.

If people were so smart and ideas like this are just abstract, why did Hitler even get into power?

5412,"&gt; The median income here in Hungary is $600 in Budapest, but the rent for one bedroom flat is $300 a month, groceries $150-200 a month. There is a reason that 25% of the population lives in poverty here.

Though it has to be said, rents can be this high relative to salaries because rental markets are fundamentally different in west and east. 

In western Europe, like in North America, almost everyone rents and a minority of mostly wealthy people own their properties so the rent costs have to conform to what the average person can pay, with upward pressure because of large international appeal of western cities (everyone wants to live in Amsterdam or Los Angeles, not so much in Warsaw or Budapest) which east European cities distinctly lack. 

In Eastern Europe, on the other hand, vast majority of people already own their apartments that they or their parents got in communist times so the rental market isn't for everyone but is mostly for expats, people in international jobs and people with money looking to upgrade their apartment/house or to get second/third and so on place.

See: https://www.lazard.com/media/450337/lazard-levelized-cost-of-energy-version-110.pdf

(It’s been pointed out to me before by nuclear advocates that Lazard’s estimation is too high, if anyone has a better estimate, let me know.)

On the other hand, wind (and renewables in general) have been breaking records in 2017. 

http://www.irena.org/publications/2018/Jan/Renewable-power-generation-costs-in-2017

New onshore wind was on average $40/MWh in 2017. 2.5 times as cheap as Hinkley. And $40 puts it below the cost of coal or gas...

Offshore wind farms in the UK, Denmark, Netherlands and Germany saw record low tender offers in 2017. Germany and Netherlands have announced subsidy free offshore wind farms, putting the total cost at around €50/MWh. 

The downside is that renewable energy requires backup costs. However, I would argue that wind being 1.5-3.0 times as cheap as nuclear, that would leave plenty of room to solve that problem.

Nevertheless, I also believe that nuclear is going to be unavoidable. We’re definitely going to need it in the future. However, we shouldn’t do it because it’s cheap, because it isn’t.",The Netherlands,/r/europe/comments/8gx6q3/nuclear_power_in_the_eu/dyfqu76/,Bierdopje,1525440436

5614,"I cannot talk about the other professions, but in IT the problem is on both sides: employees and employers.

I have a comfortable enough job with a decent salary but have been kinda looking for something better for almost a year now. I am a more or less accomplished software developer with enough experience and a good enough CV to get 5 job offers a week on average since I turned my LinkedIn status to ""actively looking"".

From where I stand, the positions I am offered suffer from the following problems (all of these issues that have been chewed to death for years on subreddits like r/programming so what I am saying here is nothing new):

- A coder is a coder and nothing more. A glorified stenographer if you will. In all the places I have been (have been doing a fair bit of consulting as well) software developers are completely excluded from decision making, even when their opinions or ideas are relevant.
- Salaries are good but not nearly as good as supply and demand would require if there was indeed a problem with recruiting people. In reality, consultant rates have gone down since 2008. Hmm.
- Ridiculous requirements when it comes to ""years of experience"" which show a clear lack of understanding of the subject matter. This has led to a situation where I have felt forced to write shit like ""7 years of Java experience"" if it was 7 years ago that I had my first job at which some of the code I had to read and debug was written in Java. Bullshit.

All this is compounded by the fact that there is indeed quite a large variation in skill and you basically have to employ someone for at least a couple of months before knowing what they can and cannot do. This is of course a big reason why companies come up with ridiculous ""years of experience"" requirements or refuse to pay good enough salaries. Basically, companies kind of average the salary for the pool of software developers they feel they need to employ, understanding perfectly well that some of them are much more productive than others.

5652,"&gt;Your entire post is based on one giant strawman where you just take the concept of an echo chamber to the extreme and presume that reality actually works like that.

I took no concept to an extreme, and my analogy is something which really happened. How can I be more grounded in reality than quoting from it?

&gt; For your story to work, we have to uncritically accept the right wing idea that their ideas ARE censored and unavailable to the public. This is simply flat out wrong. We live in a digital age, and if Joe wanted to see their arguments, he always had the option.

No, your point is exactly *how* the story happened. You *can* access this information - from extremist websites who will very merrily divulge a one-sided view, and turn people into radicals. The fact that we're debating whether people explicitly invited to universities to talk should actually be allowed to do so should likewise show that your point that these views aren't censored is nonsense - if there was no issue, the whole debate is nonsensical. Finally, my post wasn't solely about the far right, that was just one example - you can apply exactly the same argument to any polarised political stance, and in fact should.

&gt;You say ""There's a clear and ever present danger created by this current culture of refusal to even talk about this stuff"", but there is no such culture, we talk about this stuff all the time.

Oh really? Do we? I've had several people privately message me, because they'd never heard any of the arguments against the racial IQ differences, and I've had to give quite lengthy rebuttals with evidence to them, because they were totally in the dark. When was the last time you heard that discussed openly and in earnest? When was the last time you heard a vibrant, respectful exchange of ideas around differences in crime between nationalities, rather than people saying it should be shut down shouting at people who say it's a massive issue? You cannot seriously look someone in the eye and say there's open debates on these things, because there simply isn't. 

&gt;Whenever you let a Nazi speak and then call them a Nazi, they cry censorship. It's ridiculous, but for them, it's also obvious: If you're a purveyor of truth, any disagreement with you is obviously an attempt to silence the truth.

*That's exactly the point of my post.* That's *literally* the entire issue. They will, of course cry censorship, because by being denied the ability to speak openly they are literally be censored. You are even advocating for that. Likewise, the whole bit about them being impossible to persuade is the entire reason I'm arguing for the proposal in the OP to begin with - if it's not tackled before the ideas crystallise, you are left with a bunch of fucking Nazis who cannot be logically debated at all.

&gt;If that is the case, he either went to the worst school imaginable, possibly run by actual Nazis, or never really got the lesson to begin with. People aren't taught at school that Nazis are evil because they're evil, they're taught that Nazis followed a murderous and frankly stupid ideology, and yes, that could be considered evil.

He was taught those things, and came to his own logical conclusion that they were evil. Don't extrapolate from a single line - the point was that he had an evidence backed view that Nazis were evil.

&gt;If you go to the Nazi forum and the first reaction is ""well, they're actually not so bad at all"", maybe you just always belonged there in the first place.

For **fucks sake**. No. No, that's literally the issue - if you go browsing for forums online, it's not like all the Nazi sympathising ones shove swastikas on everything and say ""let's go gas all the jews""; they use terms like 1488, then give you biased sources about races. It's much more subtle and insidious; the fact you don't know that when this is the literal first line of defence is a great example of why I still firmly believe these campus debates are necessary. Do you seriously think most people who become Nazis have always held those views? Do you think it's some immutable truth that they are going to become supremacists? Of course that's not true. I detailed Joe's trip, or at least what I know of it - he sought self improvement, and one of the places he found was a Nazi forum. It's a one foot in the door issue; the fact he's no longer a Nazi should've immediately shown you that he doesn't ""belong"" there.

&gt;And, mind that: I do not advocate de-platforming on the basis that their ideas are dangerous and could spread; because this would implicitly acknowledge their own delusion that they're peddling an undeniable truth apparent to everybody who hears about it.  advocate it on the basis of being better for public mental health.

I'm going to take umbrage with these statements - you have, throughout your post, stated that there is no deplatforming issue, and that we should ban this sort of speech. Now, even if you somehow can get around the fact that you're saying this speech is non-influential enough that you're not advocating on that (it is, in fact, highly influential, which is the main problem), do you think it's a reasonable argument to ban everything which could affect mental health? I am quite certain my mental health would be better if I never heard about war, crime or the challenges of others - should we therefore ban discussion of those on the grounds of improving mental health? We know insulting people is a significant problem with mental health - should we therefore ban all insults of everyone ever? Please don't be so disingenuous - I know you want to ban it so it doesn't spread and I think that's rational. Words don't need to be truthful to convert people, let's not pretend that acknowledging that is giving them any credence. But please don't pretend that there's some other major driving factor than minimising exposure to an effective virus-esque ideology.

&gt; There is no point in debating them, because they can't be debated; and that's an issue you have brought up at the very beginning of your post only to then entirely ignore it. If you attempt to debate those people, you lose, because their entire ideology is built in such a way that whoever argues with them will lose.

And yet, Joe is no longer a Nazi. Crucially, you're actually agreeing with my initial argument; you're quite correct that when these ideas set root they are nearly impossible to shift. For every Joe, there's a hundred who double down on their positions. What you seem to have missed is that I'm arguing for this to be attacks in universities - we know that views are extremely likely to change in those formative adult years, and that leaves young people highly susceptible to radicalism. It should come as no surprise that most Islamists charged with conspiracy to commit terror attacks are between 18-23, and in higher education - they are more likely to be influenced in that period than any other point in life past that. You cannot convince most extremists to change their mind, but you can give people the facts of the matter and humiliate those extremists with rational arguments, which does convince others they are wrong. That's the point - I feel it's better to nip the issue in the bud than to allow it to grow uncontrolled underground, with no open way to attack the heart of their key points.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/8gnimv/crackdown_on_students_silencing_free_speech/dyfr3xw/,ColdStrain,1525440737

5736,"Calabria launches herself in the future of industry 4.0 with Hitachi: the *Rail Italy* division of the japanase group has signed an agreement with the ministy of Economic development and the Region in order to expand the facility of Reggio Calabria, that will be expanded for the production and the assembly of new trainsets destined for the european and US markets. 50 new recruitments are already expected. A programme of industrial development that, other than the production investments, forsees a research and development project that looks towards the entire national territory.

Total value of the operation, 16 million euros, with which it will also be possible to expand the test areas for the vehicles and to install new robots in order to increment the quality levels of the special processes. The objective is “to increase the productive capacity, innovate the industrial technologies and to implement the process of digital transformation”, as specified by the Ministry. “Indeed, Hitachi aims at the creation of the trains of the future, suburban for the european market, trams and metros for the US market, produced in digital 4.0 factories”.

Theirs is the Frecciarossa 1000, but also the driverless metros for the cities of Milano (Linea 5), Roma, Taipei, Riyadh, Copenaghen, Honolulu, Salonicco and Lima; the traditional metros with driver for Milano, Fortaleza, Miami and in the near future also the one of Baltimora. In the italian factories of the company are currently in construction the duble decked regional Rock trains for *Trenitalia*. *Hitachi Rail Italy* employees around 2 thousand workers, divided etween the facilities of Napoli, Pistoia and Reggio Calabria, as reported by a recent article of the *Sole24Ore*.

For the minister Calenda “The development agreement [which has been] signed is an important step for fueling a virtuous process of [attraction of investments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Coy8Hoa1DNw) and consolidation of already existing realities in Calabria. A stimulus for productivity, human capital and infrastructures, that represents an important lever for the modernisation of the industrial fabric of the territories”.

According to the president of the Region of Calabria Mario Oliverio “the signing of the agreement constitutes a central point of the new industrial policy of Calabria. It secures the already existing employment and allows to immediatly expand the employees hired for indefinate time”. Francesco Russo, vicepresident of the Junta and regional assessor to logistics and habour system, belives that “this agreement is the demonstration that facilities like the one of *Hitach*i have a future in Calabria”.

Now don’t get me wrong, I am not someone who values marriage as something special or sacred, but a lot of people do. Gay people want to get married for the same reason that other people get married. Opposite sex couples can get a civil union as well, yet many choose to get married, because apparently they view it as something special. 

From what I can see here, people, gay or straight, want to get married not because of demonstrative reasons, but because they love each other, and view marriage as something that proves that to each other.

5744,"What I am trying to say is this entire series of events has been handled horribly and has taken to us to a point where we are all worse off than before as a society. The right is stubborn and is not going to budge and now they are stronger than before. The seperatist have thrown any pretense of wanting to do the right thing when they started only representating the parts of society that want a republic and declared themselves independent. Wanting something and then threatening to do something else that breaks the rules of a society is just as bad as someone refusing to listen to cooperate with a democratic demand and reach a consensus because it weakens those rules. I'm sure you are aware of the numerous uprisings that occured in the 19th century that had these aims in mind and made Spain unstable.  Instead of abadoning the messaging of seperating with a republic, they're still going to build their program around that. Meanwhile both sides are going to continue the ""It's not us, it's them!"" rhetoric because it gives them political strength. 

The only way I see out of this where the people in Catalonia  get something out of this(and I want them to since I believe that Spain is a pluranational nation and we have to work together to make our country prosperous and better) is for parties that aren't part of the governing seperatist coaltion and part of the national governing coatition to get voted out so that other groups can work to a consensus that everyone is happy with.

5770,"For instance on the issue of naval rearmament

The limitations imposed by the peace-treaty on the German military were severe, but outright unnecessary punitive in regards to the navy. Without going much into details, the gist of Versailles here was that the German navy was reduced in numbers to a token fleet(in the range of secondary powers) and in practice(through size limitations) barred from constructing capital ships. These limitations however went far beyond any kind of reasonable security against future aggression, the Entente effectively reduced the German Navy to nothingness.

The pre-war German Navy was in 1914 the second largest in the world and as such an immense symbol of pride within nationalistic circles which is why the democratic German governments after the war tried to amend these limitations towards more reasonable restrictions. They tried for instance to join the Washington Naval Treaty, which would have allowed Germany to have a fleet comparable to those of France or Italy. This attempt was not that unreasonable considering that even the extended limitations would have by no means endangered the might of the British Navy, however the British denied this. Admittedly, the British started to get warmer to that idea in 1930, however they were stopped by the French back then. 
In the end, a consensus on this issue was found, but this time without the French and between Nazi Germany and UK in form of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement of 1935.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/8gu599/french_soldiers_demand_respect_in_1923/dyflxwr/,Jmp20,1525433937

It is okay to just not care about the issue. But why not just support the reform and be done with it? If not enough people cared to push for certain reforms - slavery, for example, would still be around.

But then if the reform was successfully implemented, in some of the countries there still would be massive protests to reverse it. Then you'll be in a similar position. Why not just support the reversal? Surely if the reversal was implemented, the whole issue would be done with.

Hence the dilemma. In each country the definition of ""marriage"" and the consequences of ""same-sex marriage"" can be very different, but at the end of the day it is still either ""yes"" or ""no"", nothing in between.

The difference, however, is that the choice of allowing same-sex marriage seems to be much more stable in the long term with how the societies develop (from strict differentiation between men-women roles in the society towards looser and broader concept of an individual regardless of sex) and the fact that homosexuality was found to be a biological phenomenon with its place in evolution.

5832,"&gt;I just stated that the hosting domain is right-wing / conservative inclined, and that OP has conservative views when it comes to architecture, and I feel that we should keep this into account when debating such a matter.

And I don't really think this is relevant, given that the OP has almost certainly lifted this image from elsewhere. The hosting website can therefore not be used as evidence for their political persuasion.

&gt;The baseline discussion here with modern = GLORIOUS, post-modern = BaD is kind of simplistic, that's all.

These discussions are usually no more than aesthetic judgements, which is inherently simplistic. You can talk at length about the deeper socio-economic/political aspects of traditional vs contemporary architecture, but at the end of the day it comes down to what people visually prefer. Yes this is simplistic, but that doesn't detract from the view in any way.

Also, I don't agree with your assertion (in other comments) that being supportive of traditional architecture means that one is likely affiliated with the right. As someone keenly interested in architectural history, I often engage in discussions of this sort, and the vast majority of people are moderates/left-leaning.  Sure there are some right-wingers, but there are in everything. I myself am quite left-leaning, and don't like people assuming I'm right wing just because I like traditional architecture.

Again this mentality. The point is that you can build homes for poor people while still maintaining at least minimal architectural standards. It's like going to the very extreme with cost-efficiency, sacrificing anything left of beauty and aesthetics. Might sound ""useful"", but when entire cities are built like that, you are actually left with dull, depressing living space that implicitly affects its people's mentality. So later, do you start demolishing it all as you no longer face masses of homeless people as people actually seek decent homes or maybe it would have been wiser to keep some sense of integrity, variety and aesthetics in architecture, especially in cities where that's always been the case?

There's a reason such crap is no longer built. I think Soviet era could be a candidate of the worst architectural era in history of Europe.

Not really. They have the same problem as everyone else: no solution for what to do with the waste in sight. And no political will to find a solution either. So the issue just keeps lingering while the waste stockpiles get larger and larger.

For the USA they have a 2nd problem too. They agreed with Russia to reduce their nuclear weapons stockpiles. In the cold war each of them had over 30'000 nukes iirc. For a while they have been in the process of reducing them. But like with the waste from the energy plants they have no solution for these decommissioned weapons either.

5898,"&gt; I don't agree with your assertion (in other comments) that being supportive of traditional architecture

I'm sorry if I came off that way. I actually like old architecture, especially Gothic style buildings such as the Dome of Koln.

My point was not to make fun of people that like old stuff, it was just to signal the fact that this retoric with ""old is *better* than new"", modernism was the pinnacle of human culture and it's all going to the toilet ever since, everything that happened after the 60s culture-wise is toxic, is just a toxic way of seeing this world. 

I feel that this ""the status quo is good, any change from it is bad"" train of thought is typical of traditional/conservative views. I also feel that classical conservatives would have kept the opinion to themselves, would not have generalized based on anecdotes, and would have kept debates rational, ethical and moral.

The whole book is more or less built as guide to rulership with lessons on how to ascend to power, consolidate power and maintain power in a more less absolutistic state with the Prince having unlimited power. The afforementioned ""virtú"" is different from being virtuous as he means acting in the right way in certain situations. There are parts of the book, which are nowadays obsolete like the difference kinds of Princedoms or not using mercanary armies but militia armies recruited from your own lands, but there are a lot of universially applicable ideas.

For example the idea of the fall guy. Using the people as a shield against your rivals, as a popular Prince can rarely be ousted by political rivals when he has the support of the people. Either crushing your rivals completly and utterly so that no they may never recover or handing them the olive branch, but not acting in between the extremes. Ruling through fear, but not becoming hated as a result. Being niggardly with your own money, but generous with that of others. Maintaining a nice public fassade and not letting any vices, which can't be surpressed surface. Always being faithful and not breaking with any traditions, even and especially if the Prince himself is not very faithful.

The Prince has really to be read in conjunction with his other work, Discourses on Livi. All in all the Prince does not have to be an evil person, he can in fact have noble goals, but that does not mean he can shy away from reprehensible tasks.

The reason for this is that the EU's ports are Dutch, the goods for and from the industrial and population heartlands of Europe goes through the Dutch ports.

Excise and tariffs are collected by the Dutch, which then give them back to the EU budget. That is a big part of what you are seeing when you look at the contributions.

On top of that German and French ports have lost huge amounts of business to the Dutch ports, all that money is kept in NL, making the Dutch the biggest beneficiaries of Europe. Those moneys are not redistributed.

Europe enables this and it's fine, it's more efficient that way.

5978,"""poorer"" is such a poor word in this case. Swedes are not getting poorer compared to other swedes. We still have the same purchasing power within sweden as we did a year ago. The thing that is happening is that we have less purchasing power abroad because of our weaker currency. But that doesn't sound as click-baity as this title.

I work at the Swedish central bank. The reason our currency is plummenting is because our number one priority has been to get our inflation up so that we have a buffer in time of crisis. In mid april we missed our target inflation level which weakened our currency by a couple of percent since analysts expected us to hit. 

I can't go into too much detail, but there are strong forces from within the central bank that wants us to now start raising the rates already which will then in turn make the swedish crown stronger.
