I would strongly suggest that you join the union if you want the benefit it provide. You seems to not really know what you are talking about, applying different law for different countries is illegal under the WTO, but forming an union in which there is common rules and an abolition of border isn't.

Leave's claims about money to the NHS, that it would be the easiest deal in history and so much more. Not to sound childish but it doesn't seem fair to have a country to make a decision based on false evidence and then force them to go through with it no matter what. You could even argue that it might have set a precedent for making sure information is properly vetted and fact checked ahead of campaigns and referendums, forcing politicians and lobbyists into actually telling the truth lest they incur fines etc.

Also, not to sound sassy but if they wanted a situation where we can't revote, then that's exactly the reason why they should have used a legally binding vote.

167,"&gt; What's weird about that is the nationalist type's are, frankly, idiots. They rail against elites and outsiders and all that shit about how much better things were or would be but it's all some other country's fault 

Yeah, that's a strawman. No nationalist really beliefs it's the fault of other countries. It's the self-hating cult that is prominent in the West (but also in countries like India) that is the problem.  


&gt; While the left's no monolith they, accurately, address the fact the problem might be the guy back home sleeping atop wealth that'd make a dragon blush while pretending to 'create' jobs that pay half what they should. 

The issue with the left is that this is not the only problem there is. The rampant materialism in leftism I find a huge issue. There is more to life than money. Societal and cultural values, glory, honour, a sense of belonging, all of these are also important for a worthy life.   


&gt; It then splinters into a thousand factions that can't quite agree on how that should be addressed while the right builds golden statues to racist property developers as the second coming of christ. 

The fact that you think the right is not splintered just shows you are not very familiar with right wing groups and their beliefs.

179,"&gt;The UK is a sovereign, unitary state with some devolution. It's not really comparable to the EU in which each members state is an individual member of the WTO.

And EU countries are part of a union which allow them to do just that under the WTO, what is your point?

&gt;I have not once stated that you should be unable to put in such arbitrary rules. However, arbitrary rules have consequences which may include the UK targeting your goods in response.

We removed most of the border inside the single market so obviously we have to put them at the border of the single market, this is in no way arbitrary. There is countries in the union and countries outside the union this is really clearly defined and in no way arbitrary. What would be arbitrary is to randomly select country outside the union and don't apply rule for them. Which is not authorized under the WTO btw.

&gt;Every country is trying to have its cake and eat it. It's such a meaningless phrase.

That is a strong argument indeed. The fact that you are able to quite the EU and be surprized when you are considered like a countries outside the EU is always surprising.

212,"Last year’s summer was a try out of what we’re going to get in the coming decades. With the difference being that it’s only going to get warmer and more humid. I’m afraid of what summer will be like in ten years.
The amount of springtime and fall we had last year was noticeably shorter than they used to be. It won’t be long before those two will disappear entirely and we’ll end up with just summer and winter. Until winters get warmer and warmer and disappear as well, which hopefully is still decades away. (Hundreds of years, or even a hundred years feels out of the question, with the blue ocean event only being years at the most away at this point.)

Last year was the first year where my thermostat repeatedly reached its limit over several weeks. The limit is 35C. Had to have all of my windows open, otherwise I’d boil in my own apartment. For this reason alone I’m going to get blackout curtains for all of my windows this summer. Those at the south side of my apartment alone aren’t cutting it anymore. Also needing to get good anti pollen screens. Never had that much problems with hayfever, but last year was ridiculously bad. Never had to take cetirizine on a daily basis.

274,"The U.S. has dropped a key demand in negotiations over digital taxation of technology companies such as Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Facebook Inc., lifting a barrier that had raised transatlantic trade tensions and prevented an international deal.

Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told her counterparts at a virtual meeting of Group of 20 finance officials that the U.S. is no longer calling for a so-called safe harbor rule that would allow U.S. companies to opt out of paying such a tax overseas, according to a Treasury spokeswoman.

Yellen said the U.S. will now engage robustly in negotiations on both that issue and on a global minimum tax, the spokeswoman said.

The talks between around 140 countries on how to overhaul tax rules stumbled last year when Donald Trump’s administration demanded there should be a safe harbor regime. Most other countries said they couldn’t accept such optionality on paying tax.

“Today we saw a strong tailwind for a fair taxation of the large digital corporations,” German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said. “My U.S. colleague Janet Yellen declared today at the G20 finance ministers that the U.S. will join in.”

## Way to Go

There is still some distance to go to get a global deal on digital tax. Beyond the issue of safe harbor, the U.S. and Europe have long been at odds over the scope of any new rules. There are also outstanding issues over the amount of profit to be reallocated to different jurisdictions and how to ensure and enforce tax certainty.

“The devil is in the details and going from an accord on guidelines to a detailed one with lots of small and big issues to be defined won’t be a walk in the park,” Italian Finance Minister Daniele Franco said at the G20 press conference.

There are large sums at stake. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which is charing the talks, estimates that minimum and digital tax reforms together would boost tax revenues by between $60 billion to $100 billion, or 4% of global corporate income tax.

Disagreements over digital taxation morphed into a tit-for-tat transatlantic trade dispute in 2019 and 2020 as the negotiations dragged on.

European officials welcomed with the U.S. giving up on safe harbor, with Scholz describing it as a “giant step” to meeting the OECD objective of concluding talks this summer.

“Getting an agreement by the summer is within reach, above all since the U.S. has confirmed it has given up on the safe harbor principle,” French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said.",,/r/europe/comments/ltbszv/uk_eu_us_drops_digital_tax_demand_opening_door_to/goxejxl/,HappyPanicAmorAmor,1614392885

 *A person imprisoned or otherwise physically restricted because of their political, religious or other conscientiously held beliefs, ethnic origin, sex, colour, language, national or social origin, economic status, birth, sexual orientation or other status – who has not used violence or advocated violence or hatred*

And concerns around that were raised within the Amnesty given that Navalny had apparently, made comments (and launched a campaign at one point?) which may have amounted to advocacy of hatred and constituted incitement to discrimination, violence or hostility in the past, and hadn't repudiated those acts.

It's also worth pointing out that Amnesty have been pretty consistent about this, see the decision for Amnesty to no longer [consider Nelson Mandela a prisoner of conscience](https://www.amnesty.org.uk/nelson-mandela-and-amnesty-international), after the Rivonia Trial falls into the same category.

324,"It is not clear which is the oldest so the map is kind of bullshit. 

&gt;As the oldest university in the English-speaking world, Oxford is a unique and historic institution. There is no clear date of foundation, but teaching existed at Oxford in some form in 1096 and developed rapidly from 1167, when Henry II banned English students from attending the University of Paris.

vs 

&gt; The date of the University of Bologna's founding is uncertain, but believed by most accounts to have been 1088.[13] The university was granted a charter (Authentica habita) by Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa in 1158, but in the 19th century, a committee of historians led by Giosuè Carducci traced the founding of the University back to 1088, which would make it the oldest continuously-operating university in the world.[14][15][16] However, the development of the institution at Bologna into a university was a gradual process. Paul Grendler writes that “it is not likely that enough instruction and organization existed to merit the term university before the 1150s, and it might not have happened before the 1180s.”[17]

353,"&gt; I say these dual one-way pumps and hoses are counterproductive wastes of time and energy. It would be much better if there was only 1 pump that takes from whichever glass has more, and sends it to the other

Two one way pumps make a two-way pump. 

&gt; Or, even better, makes sure they are filled at the same rate from above.

This doesn't fix inequalities.

&gt; This is neither Feminism nor Masculism

Feminism wants to reach equality and once that's reached, just watch that the achievements are not lost. That's it. 

&gt; Division between people who want the same goal, equality of genders, is not a productive thing.

It's not feminists the ones dividing. See the comments here. 

&gt; And, colleges identifying as historically black should drop the racist banner and reidentify as something that actually says ""historically accepting of everyone"" instead. After all, isn't that the goal? 

Again, if you try to fix an unequal situation by giving the same resources to everyone, you just perpetuate the unequal situation.

&gt; Again, we need to be unified, not artificially divided by race-based and gender-based identification.

If you don't acknowledge problems that arise from race and gender identification you will never fix them. And pointing that these problems exist is not division. It is required to achieve unity.

* Bangladesh: had little-to-nothing to do with her.  She's never been there.  Her *parents* came from Bangladesh.  Bangladesh had no real ability to affect whether she was gonna go to ISIS.  Bangladesh maintains that she is not Bangladeshi, just that she has the right to apply for Bangladeshi citizenship (which they've already said, as I recall, that they would reject).

* The UK: Was where she was raised.  Had the legal authority, if anyone did, to intervene.  The country she knew up until she acted.

* The Syrian Kurds who were holding her: her only link to them was that she entered Syria illegally and linked up with a movement that was trying to impose some radical theocracy on them.  They've tried the people they wanted to try and consider her unimportant.  They just want her gone back to where she came from — she never had a legal right to be there.  Insofar as anyone has been a victim here, they've been.

First of all, you're pulling that out of your ass. There's literally nothing in the study that suggest that, you're just making it up to justify protect your precious ideology.

499,"&gt;Irreconcilable enemies? Decades to heal? Calm down, it was a democratic decision to leave a political union. That's it.

Yeah, you'll see it down the line if you don't see it now, don't worry. In the next decade or two, everything that will go wrong will be blamed on that decision (by both sides). 

We still see that in France about the 35h week, and it was a lot less conflictual than Brexit has been for you guys (and that was 20 years ago). And that will poison quite a bit any debate and political discourses for a while. 

And yes, Brexit has caused your parties to fracture quite a bit along the remain/leave lines and that will leave scars too. 

So yes, Brexit will leave scars on UK politics for a decade or two, nothing drama queen about it. It won't kill the UK, bring down the apocalypse or anything like that, but it'll be seen, remembered and it will sour a bit the ambient atmosphere in politics. 

And you'll get rejoin movements popping in if the economic situation of the UK doesn't improve enough and when you add to that the separatists movements in Scotland and NI gaining ground, there will probably be a bit of a rocky decade on that front too. Once again, nothing cataclysmic, nothing set in stone, but it'll sour the atmosphere for a while whatever happens next. 

So yeah, all in all, after 4 years of Brexit, I can definitely see why other whatever-xit parties tend to let go of that idea, especially since the UK had the advantage of still using the pound and not the Euro. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; While we're here, I've got a serious question. There are other Western  European countries that have decided not to join, I'm thinking Norway,  Iceland, Switzerland. Why is it fine for them to be separate but not the  UK? Why is the media painting us as some kind of traitors? Why, as it  seems from your reply, are people buying into it? 

Not sure what you mean by that. Of course you can leave the EU or never join, that's your prerogative as a sovereign nation, nothing evil or traitorous about that.

Every test has what is called false positive. It is when you take a test and it shows that you are covid positive even though you are not. Even the best test kits have a false negative of 0.1%, meaning that statistically for every 1000 tests one of those results would deliver a positive result. So how come your factory, which has most probably already had more than 1000 tests had 0 positive?

564,"&gt; How about the other three iundustries listed then? Childcare, preschool teaching and cleaning? You don't think men would generally ask more than what the employer is offering?

No, the reason why men don't go there / are not encouraged, or why they are rejected is precisely because there is a negative stereotype for men in those jobs, as if every single man would be a brute so they can't care for sick people, or a pedophile so they cant care for kids ; on the flipside it reinforces the stereotype of the perfect caring woman, as if there can't be abusive females in these jobs as well. So here is the sexism, men are portrayed always as evil, whereas females as always good. In reality all 4 categories exist good &amp; bad for both sexes, but for some reason only 2 are highlighted. This is the sexism right there. If gender relations would be more balancedly portrayed, then it wouldn't be that bad. 

.

Likewise I am not going to look down on males who go out of their stereotype and call them soyboys or whatnot, that is just stupid.

640,"These X amount of woman got killed, got harassed, got insulted media pieces are bullshit to me, you’re under total control of this trending media bias. Why X AMOUNT of woman’s death is somehow statistically important, are they supposed to live eternally, or is there a divine meaning to their lives just because they are from the opposite gender so we check back monthly how we failed to protect these worthy creatures? Check crime records, how many men are dying monthly, or how many men are getting assaulted, harassed or insulted. But men lives? Who cares. It doesn’t serve to any agenda. If numbers are quite above than woman murders, it’s not gender issue, it signals that crime is rising. There is a huge online gambling mafia rising in istanbul, its illegal, prostitution is also rising, and their mafia. Do you know how many of them are involving women as well? They just simply don’t go out and murder people, Sedat Peker used massage saloons to blackmail his rivals, who were the people working there? There are huge tendencies to commit crime in Turkey, for money or because of social backwardness of families that can’t adopt urban life. Education plays a huge role on that, those men are at some point, are being raised by their mothers. Was it your father who raised you? No. In our society our mothers design our childhood, they indoctrinate us. Should we blame them for not raising proper sons? Still no. Have you seen the news how many women sent nudes to that guy who murdered a woman so that he can relax in his jail, simply because he was a rich guy? And they wrote him she deserved it. Anyways, seems like you don’t understand what my point is. Regardless of how shit our country-government-culture towards our genders, Turkish women are lacking personal development by a huge margin comparing to Turkish men. Don’t tell me our system is patriarchal or whatever, this is the closest to EVEN as we can get in our history. There are universities, there are jobs, there are lots of opportunities for women comparing to our 50 years back. Do our girls struggling to climb up just as we do? No. Sheer amount of them are focused to marriage or living the moment. I met a Belarussian girl 10 years ago in Istanbul, their country is backwards just as ours, but we had a nice talk about video games, politics, history and we arranged a meeting to do sports together, cycle etc. When you talk about these to Turkish girls, they will stare at their phones and scroll down on Instagram and make you pay the bill, leave, never come back, unless you arrange a house party or a trip that she can make cool IG photos. You’re trying to justify their stall because they are in hostile environment while most of do live in the same environment is beyond baseless. Do you really believe they harass women on the streets only in Turkey, is that why Nasa has lots of females but Turkey is not having any successful female scientist? Keep on simping.

“Turkish men’s passion” is a delusion which way too many Turkish men have caused to be referred to as “Turkish men’s pushiness and desperation”. I’m a Turkish man myself. I’m not insulting anyone, this is a fact. No one appreciates that shit. 

And then there’s so many of the Turkish men in Turkey, who by your account must be some of the most hard-working, industrious people out there, and not the oversensitive, aggressive, disrespectful people I’ve so often seen around me.

The fact of the matter is, whether good or bad people, and without reference for individuals, Turkish women live in an incredibly hostile environment.

744,"&gt;Amnesty International says it no longer considers jailed Russian anti-Kremlin activist Alexei Navalny a ""prisoner of conscience,"" citing past comments he's made that ""reach the threshold of advocacy of hatred.""

&gt;The rights group declared Navalny a prisoner of conscience in January following his arrest upon returning to Russia from Germany, where he received treatment after a near-fatal exposure to what doctors believe was a Soviet-era nerve agent, known as Novichok, which has been used in the past in assassination attempts carried out by Russian intelligence. The Kremlin denies the attack, which is viewed by Navalny supporters and western nations as an effort to eliminate a troublesome critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

&gt;Earlier this month, Navalny was sentenced to 32 months in prison on charges that he broke the terms of a probation agreement tied to a 2014 embezzlement conviction. Navalny has called that case, and others against him, politically motivated.

&gt;In a statement issued Wednesday, Amnesty said referring to Navalny that it would ""continue to fight for his freedom,"" but that the organization had ""taken an internal decision to stop referring to Aleksei Navalny as a prisoner of conscience in relation to comments he made in the past.""

&gt;""Some of these comments, which Navalny has not publicly denounced, reach the threshold of advocacy of hatred, and this is at odds with Amnesty's definition of a prisoner of conscience,"" the statement said.

&gt;Asked by NPR to provide specifics about the ""past comments"" the organization referred to, Amnesty declined. However, in a follow up statement, Julie Verhaar, Amnesty's acting secretary general, referred to speculation surrounding the decision on Navalny, saying it is ""detracting attention"" from the organization's efforts to win his release.

&gt;""This distraction only serves the Russian authorities, who have jailed Navalny on politically motivated charges, simply because he dared to criticize them,"" Verhaar said.

&gt;""We note that some of Aleksei Navalny's past comments have been actively used by his opponents to discredit him,"" Verhaar added.

&gt;Amnesty International says it uses seven criteria to decide whether someone is a prisoner of conscience, determining, among other things, that the person ""has not used or advocated violence but is imprisoned because of who they are (sexual orientation, ethnic, national or social origin, language, birth, colour, sex or economic status) or what they believe (religious, political or other conscientiously held beliefs).""

&gt;Navalny, who has become the country's leading opposition figure and anti-corruption champion, has nonetheless long been controversial – including among Russia's liberals. Some of them have questioned overtly nationalistic statements that he made early in his career targeting migrants and ethnic groups in Russia's southern Caucasus region. His allies insist that his positions have evolved over time and suggest that Amnesty may have fallen for a coordinated online campaign by pro-Kremlin bloggers to discredit the opposition figure.

&gt;In recent days, videos of Navalny have been widely circulated on social media. In one that appears to be several years old, Navalny compares Chechen rebels to ""cockroaches"" and suggests that a pistol is the best way to eliminate them. In another video from 2007, Navalny espouses strong nationalistic views, saying, ""We have a right to be (ethnic) Russians in Russia. And we'll defend that right.""

&gt;To protest Amnesty's decision, an attorney for Navalny's FBK anticorruption group was quoted by Reuters as saying he would renounce his own ""prisoner of conscience"" status that Amnesty gave him in 2018.

&gt;Speaking to NPR's Weekend Edition in January, Julia Davis, a Russian media and disinformation expert, said Navalny ""still has nationalist leanings"" and among other things, supported Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea, which was widely condemned internationally.

&gt;""No one could say that he is in perfect alignment with all of the Western values,"" Davis told host Scott Simon. ""But there again, that's not what he aims to represent. What he mainly represents is the possibility that the Russians might be the ones to decide who gets to lead Russia.""",Germany,/r/europe/comments/lt0jhk/amnesty_rescinds_prisoner_of_conscience/gou9ycb/,PeteWenzel,1614354984

The Chair of the populist Finns Party, Jussi Halla-aho said he is not pushing for an EU exit and is “in principle” not against the bloc in a podcast published Thursday, despite his party’s existence being based on criticising the Union.

When running for the party leadership in 2017, Halla-aho said he would be actively seeking Finland’s exit from the EU also known as ‘Fixit’, as well as from the common currency.

However, in what is clearly a change of heart – possibly due to the pandemic, Russia, or simply political opportunism – the party leader said that as a net payer, Finland should now be leading by example and show other member states what is acceptable and what is not. According to him, his country should also defend its national interests.  

“There are many things that are cheaper to do together rather than separately. But, if the EU does not focus on issues producing a real surplus to member states and their citizens then the Union means just a disadvantage to us, “Halla-aho told the Hjalliksen kotona podcast.

It's actually a good gage of measuring climate change because it is a relatively controlled climate. You need enough insulative air and solar heat to warm the region up quicker. Greenhouse gases could be a factor in a consistent increase in a warmer Hungary at this time of year but it could also be orbital shifts as well.

996,"I also am unenthusiastic about the incentives created by having dual nationals having a sort of ""second-class citizenship"" that might be stripped by whichever country decides that they're annoying and to withdraw citizenship first.

There were historically certain reasons for this that I wouldn't call unreasonable.  Like, say a dual national has a war between two countries and serves in Country A's military, some countries treated that as choosing Country A

But there is no question here of that, of Begum picking Bangladesh as being a country to support over the UK.  She did something that made her undesirable to both countries, and the UK saw an opportunity to make her Bangladesh's problem.  I don't even know whether she knew that she could be considered a Bangladeshi national.  It is the position of thr British state that ISIS isn't even a country that one could legitimately join.  In practice, given that Bangladesh has not shown any willingness at all to take her in, she's the responsibility of some random Kurdish village, whose only association with her is that she was in opposition to them.

There is a whole lot that I am not enthusiastic about here.  Creates a lot of what I'd call misincentives.

* The purpose for permitting stripping citizens of British nationality in this case was that the UK shouldn't create stateless people, which creates messes.  It is quite possible, given Bangladesh's conflicting position, that she will be effectively stateless, with Bangladesh considering her British but not Bangladeshi and the UK considering her Bangladeshi but not British.  This sort of scenario was what the treaty that caused the restriction was aimed at preventing.

* The UK does not permit minors to renounce British citizenship because it does not consider them in a position to be able to make an informed call on the merits and drawbacks of this.  Even in a world where the typical adult understood that joining ISIS could result in a loss of citizenship, it's hard for me to see how to reconcile these two bars.

* Creates incentive for countries of whom British nationals are dual citizens to strip citizenship prior to the UK doing so.  Let's say that another dual national gets caught doing something undesirable for both countries, like committing a serious crime.  That country now has good reason to want to strip citizenship from the person before the UK does.  I believe that normally, there is good reason to want to discourage ""races to strip citizenship"" of this sort, this which encourage precipitous action of both countries.

* Almost all legal rights in the UK rest upon citizenship.  If someone's foundation there is undermined because they are dual national, this is a legal foundation that can be taken away by any tinpot dictator in the world — you cannot stop a country from saying that you are a citizen.  Some countries don't allow renunciation of citizenship at all, like Morocco.  Many (if not all) do not allow minors to do so.  Some charge hefty fees that individuals may not be able to afford — Turkey, for example, mandates military service and deals with conscription dodging by requiring someone who has not to buy their way out.

If the UK had had a severe penalty — even execution — for what Begum did and just punished her, that wouldn't create the sort of misincentives here, and I wouldn't be complaining.  But this seems to really create a lot of bad incentives for other parties moving forward.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/lsuiqv/bbc_news_shamima_begum_not_allowed_to_return_to_uk/gotjpsp/,duisThias,1614340903
