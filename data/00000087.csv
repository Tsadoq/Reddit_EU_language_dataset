57,"Ach Berlin. Was ist Berlin? Berlin ist die Stadt für die man sich als Deutscher auf internationaler Bühne schämen muss. Wenn man Berlin mit anderen europäischen Hauptstädten wie London, Paris, Madrid und Amsterdam vergleicht, treibt es jedem anständigen Menschen die Schamesröte ins Gesicht. Selbst kleine Länder wie Österreich, Belgien oder die Schweiz haben mit Wien, Brüssel und Zürich international vorzeigbare Städte mit hoher Lebensqualität. Deutschland ist gestraft mit Berlin, der Hauptstadt der Versager. Berlin beheimatet mit Abstand am meisten Arschlöcher in der gesamten Republik. Deutsche Bahn, Bundestag, Air Berlin und der Axel Springer Verlag sind nur einige Beispiele für den unfähigen Abschaum der hier beherbergt wird. Glorreiche Zeit sind schon längst vorbei, diese Stadt liegt am Boden. Der Berliner an sich ist durch und durch ein fauler Lump. Charaktereigenschaften die in jedem zivilisierten Kulturkreis als pure Faulheit, Unfreundlichkeit, Unfähigkeit, dissoziale Persönlichkeitsstörung und Dummheit gelten, erklärt der Berliner kurzerhand zur Berliner Wesensart. Ein weiteres zentrales Merkmal ist der alles beherrschende Minderwertigkeitskomplex. Deswegen projiziert der Berliner auf jeden der in irgendeiner Weise besser ist als er, massive Hassgefühle. Besonders die ihm in allen Belangen haushoch überlegenen Süddeutschen sind ihm ein Dorn im Auge. Er neidet ihnen den Erfolg und München steht ganz oben auf seiner Hassliste. Diese Stadt ist alles und hat alles was der Berliner gerne wäre und hätte. Das München dem Berliner sein Lotterleben finanziert, interessiert den Berliner nicht, er glaubt sogar insgeheim er hätte es verdient. Anstatt sich aus seiner aus Neid und Missgunst entstehenden Lethargie zu befreien und seine Stadt umzukrempeln, ergeht er sich in asozialen Schmarotzertum und hält noch große Stücke auf seine vermeintliche Weltstadt. Kulturell ist Berliner eher schwach veranlagt, große Werke liegen lang zurück. Auch gilt hier bereits das Aussprechen des Buchstaben ""g"" als ""j"" als große Kulturleistung. Fortgeschrittene beherrschen sogar das Anhängen eines ""wa?"" an den Ende eines jeden Satzes. Das Leistungsniveau in der Küche bewegt sich auf überschaubarem Niveau. Eine Wurst aus gemahlenem Seperatorenfleisch mit Ketchup und Currygewürz wird hier als Currywurst und als kulinarischer Geniestreich verkauft. Jeder vernünftig denkende Mensch hält eine Wurst mit Ketchup wohl kaum für den heiligen Gral der Küchenkunst und wahrscheinlich noch nicht einmal für ein Rezept. Großzügig lässt der Rest der Republik den Berliner in diesem Glauben um seine Minderwertigkeitskomplexe nicht überhand nehmen zu lassen. Wirtschaftlich ist Berlin ein einziges Desaster, selbst die späte DDR stand solider da. Ansonsten fußt die Berliner Wirtschaft auf alternativen Blogs, irgendwas mit Medien und Genderstudies wenn man den Universitäten glauben darf. Ungeachtet des wirtschaftlichen Bankrottes leistet sich der Berliner trotzdem Prestigeprojekte wie das Stadtschloss und einen Flughafen der mangels Funktionstüchtigkeit als Kunstprojekt gelten soll. Ebenso beherbergt diese Stadt sämtliche Zentralen der Volksparteien, die aus Marketinggründen auf das ""Verräter"" im Namen verzichten. Bürgermeister dieser Stadt war lange der lustige Wowibär der mit seiner Prestige&amp;Prosecco Politik alles in den Abgrund riss, was noch halbwegs präsentabel war. Kurzum: Berlin ist der Fliesentisch Deutschlands. Es ist das für Deutschland, was Griechenland für die Europäische Union ist und hätte Berlin eine offene Kloake, wäre es das Rumänien Deutschlands. Berlin ist ein Schandfleck, der Pickel am Arsche Deutschlands. Berlin ist der Typ der ohne Einladung auf deine Party kommt, noch nicht mal Alkohol mitbringt und auch nicht versteht dass er nicht erwünscht ist wenn man ihm ein paar Zähne aus dem Gesicht klopft und die Treppe runterwirft. Berlin ist das Detroit Deutschlands und gehört für 200 Zloty an Polen verkauft.",Bavaria (Germany),/r/europe/comments/ha0fgu/berlin_authorities_placed_children_with/fv00qxi/,Brudilettentraeger,1592305670

\- Conte's actions in the corona crisis have been  put under the spot light by regional politicians that claimed it was his responsability to create red zones in some areas and not theirs 

\- The PD is getting scared that Conte might create a party of his own as he seems to be pretty well liked 

\- The BLM derangement syndrome has hit  small degree Italy as well: the statue of a journalist was attacked ( he raped a little black girl and was a fascist, but to anyone with a brain those are not the reasons the statue is there) 

\- Milan's mayor (centre left) and politicians at large have declared this an act of mad vandalism so at the very least we are living in Amerika only a little bit. The statue has been cleaned

\- Sweden felt the need to accuse Italy of having a poor health care system. The Italian ambassador in Sweden was involved in the issue. This is at least the second time Sweden feels the need to be bitchy about corona probably ( in my opinion) to deflect how they pooped out of the vase on the corona issue

\- A group of terrorist was found and arrested ( anarchists) in Rome

&gt;shitty internet 

I'm just going to quote myself from earlier in this thread

 *An independent Finnish auditor released a study not that long ago* [*http://research.rewheel.fi/insights/2020\_may\_pro\_1h2020\_release/*](http://research.rewheel.fi/insights/2020_may_pro_1h2020_release/)

*TL;  DR: The government not only doesn't regulate the prices of the ISPs but also doesn't regulate the telecommunications market, and so allowed  Vodafone, the previously public-owned now Deutsche Telekom owned  Cosmote, and Wind to create Victus Telecoms. A holding company that owns  &gt;90% of the market and bars entrance to competitors.*

*And the best thing about it? The government was quick to throw the study (even though they commissioned it) under the bus.*

*Plus, 10 years of ridiculous austerity means no investments of any kind.*

&gt;other random problems that shouldn't really exist at that level?

422,"&gt; I don't think this is an accurate picture. The town had been predominantly German for a long time

That's not correct. The city had a notable German population because of the highly significant German merchant class but the hinterland was predominantly danish, only Angeln in the east was mixed. See [here](https://danmarkshistorien.dk/fileadmin/filer/Billeder/Artikelbilleder/Dansk_sprog-_og_kulturpolitik_i_Slesvig/slesvig_sprogkort.jpg). The city was somewhat mixed but overwhelmingly supported the danish king in both Slesvig-wars. The picture is relatively clear, Flensburg was a danish city with significant German influence.

&gt; I have never heard about this campaign of moving Germans to Flensborg?

Well, he doesn't present it well but the German government pursued a policy of Germanization in the former duchy of Slesvig. The primary force was [culturally](https://graenseforeningen.dk/om-graenselandet/leksikon/fortyskning) (e.g. making German mandatory in schools, churches and administration, heavily discriminating the use of danish) however there was also an element of [settler politics](https://graenseforeningen.dk/om-graenselandet/leksikon/jordkampen) involved. On top of that of course the cultural repression was an incentive for Danes to leave for Denmark. People who stayed were stripped of Danish citizenship and got Prussian and later German citizenship instead. On top of that Prussian military service was obscenely long (3 years + 4 in the reserve) and Danes were risking getting drafted for Prussia's and Germany's stupid wars to come (my grandfather was drafted in WWII despite being danish for instance). 

So of course in 56 years the scales were massively shifted. If the cultural markup was still like 1864, Denmark would have probably opted for a single referendum for all of Slevig which would have been decisively in their favour.",For a Europe of the Regions!,/r/europe/comments/h9asp1/100_years_ago_today_north_schleswig_was/fuz3ej6/,tobias_681,1592277320

446,"&gt;  Just seen a video of a black guy shot at twice at point blank range for nothing more than running with a tazer. 

Do you really believe that this happened?

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6059375/Police-body-cam-captures-man-shot-officers-stealing-one-tasers.html

&gt; Parker had just been in a collision with another vehicle shortly before noon, near the 114 Mile Marker on I-95, which ultimately sent his vehicle with him still inside careening into a small lake, with its front end completely submerged in water.

&gt; 'Sit down,' one officer says. 'Sit down, dude. Do yourself a favor, just sit down, man. This isn't, like, what you think it is. You just need to sit down right now.' 

&gt; It sounds like Parker then says, 'I gotta sleep,' to which the officer on camera replies, 'No, you're not. you're bleeding.'

&gt;The officer then steps back, out of view of the body cam, and says, 'Sit down or you're gonna get lit up,' while pointing his taser at Parker. Gesturing with it as he speaks, he says, 'You're gonna sit down one way or another.'

&gt;The officer who had been doing most of the talking before this point, who is seemingly the one wearing the body cam, then moves around to Parker's left side and places his hand on his shoulder.

&gt; That's when Parker grabs the officer's taser.

&gt; At this point, Parker has stopped near the driver-side door to the ambulance and is pointing the stolen taser at the officers.

so:

1) Intoxicated

2) Driving

3) Caused an accident

4) Refused collaboration

5) Stole weapon

6) Pointed weapon at an officer

So two things went wrong: First, they went from de-escalation to threat and second, they shot him even though he had a non-lethal weapon.

Were the police trigger-happy? Sure. But the guy did not one, not two, but 6 escalation steps.",Czech Republic / New Zealand,/r/europe/comments/h9q1vg/under_police_pressure_france_backs_off_ban_on/fuz4fx7/,Unicorn_Colombo,1592277967

Ad-hominem attack. 

&gt; Britain and France declared war on Germany in 1939 and were actively engaged with trying to materially deprive them through sanctions and blockades 

When did this ""actively engaged"" actually start? and how much actual damage did that to Nazi Germany?

&gt; while the soviet union shook hands with Hitler carved up Poland 

More lies and projections. Soviet union never shook hands with Hitler and didn't carve up Poland; they saved Poland.

&gt;  started economic and trade relations which built up the German war machine. 

Actually, they didn't. That ended in 1941. And western nations did more ""building up the German war machine"" than USSR ever did.

&gt; Without this relationship Nazi Germany would not have carried out war the way it did and the soviet union itself would not had been invaded.

Nice assertion and more projecting. 

&gt; The British were fighting the Nazis before the soviets did, they fought them in France.

How exactly did they ""fight"" them? with baguettes with forks?

&gt; they fought them over the skies of Great Britain

That's not fighting, that's just camping.

&gt;  they fought the Italians in North Africa, 

That's not fighting that's defending colonial possessions.

&gt; the Germans in Greece

Source.

&gt; So they didn't wait. 

False. They did wait by not invading Nazi Germany until the outcome of the war had already been decided.

&gt;  What were the soviets doing until they were invaded in 1941?

Saving the people of Poland. Half of the polish population and territory was saved thanks to the Soviet Union.

&gt; Licking Hitlers asshole helping him build up his army, invading neutral countries (finland) and mass murdering poles.

Its an embarrassment because the EU is of the member states and the member states have mechanisms within NATO to defend other EU member states but don't want to make use of them.

Nearly 50% of NATO's  Enhanced Forward Presence in the Baltics is non-EU despite EU member states clearly having greater interests in the region, that's just bizarre.

NYC has three commuter rail lines: LIRR from the East, Metro North from the North, and PATH from the West.

I suppose people could technically use LIRR within NYC, but the fares are roughly 3x so I doubt anyone does. It also only has one stop in Manhattan, and a few in Brooklyn/Queens. I think Metro North is similar. PATH only has terminal stations within NYC so it's only useful for traveling to/from New Jersey.

The express lines are indeed quadruple (or sometimes only triple) track lines. They are still pretty slow, but (for example) Manhattan is only \~13 miles long, so the travel times aren't that bad. It's still much better than taking the locals.

589,"37% of the population of Ireland live in rurual areas.

For a combined public road network length of 99,830 km (62,030 miles) in 2018.

Norway has a road network of 92,946 kilometres (57,754 mi)

The United Kingdom has a network of roads, of varied quality and capacity, totalling about 262,300 miles (422,100 km).

Both those distances are taken from Wikipedia, but what we can see is that although Norway is 4.5x the size, Ireland actually has a bigger road network.

The UK, with 13x the population has only 4x the total road network, is another good reference. 

If you visit Ireland, you'll realise every single one of those roads in Ireland have houses on them, so covering the entire country would require getting fibre onto every single metre of that 99,830km of road.  That's before the cost of addding installations for every single one of those rurual houses. 

The 63% of the population who live in urban areas have quite good speeds overall, and even a decent number of the rurual areas have good connections too.

Basically, an early‐to‐mid XX century building combining a Neo‐Baroque façade with cubist elements and formerly the tallest building in Europe.

Granger is right, though. Madrid was never much in the medieval period, so very little remains from that era. And several old sections were additionally destroyed in order to build what you see in the photo. Much of this street is unified in a Spanish Baroque style that was all the rage during and after Spain's golden age (XVII and XVIII century).

Madrid unfortunately has no castles, as it simply was not a major city when castles would have been most useful. Madrid was selected to be the capital based on its central position in Spain, nearly a century after the reconquista in Spain ended. At the time, it was not much of a city, and so the buildings you see are mostly from the modern age or at the earliest, the late early modern period+enlightenment. The main street was mostly built in the XX century, but incorporates parts that are as old as the XVI century. Regardless of the fact that the buildings are mostly from the age of enlightenment and the modern age, there was a push to standardize around the Spanish Baroque style. It's a style I quite like, to be honest.

If you ever do decide to visit, don't despair: the lack of castles in Madrid proper is more than covered by places like Toledo (historic capital city) only a bit over half an hour away by train. Perfect distance to travel in the morning to check out and return if you're short on time, or you can stay there as quite a number of tourists do. Also, there's El Escorial, Aranjuez, Segovia and Ávila which all have excellent palaces, castles and other impressive architecture (from Roman aqueducts to medieval fortifications and intact city walls).",Spain,/r/europe/comments/h9mdcc/spain_madrid_gran_via/fuycs8z/,AidenTai,1592262327

629,"&gt;In legal terms, there is a huge difference. How is that not obvious to you? 

Well occupying forces are Armenian and draft calls occupying forces to withdraw. Legally or not it means the same thing just with a little more gentle tone. 

  &gt;If UNSC decided that it's specifically the armed forces of Republic of Armenia carrying out the occupation, it would definitely mention it in explicit terms.

Like I said if it did it would be vetoed by Russia. 

&gt;This argument is also false since the resolutions that accuse official Tel-Aviv of occupation date back to the 70s/80s. If we go by your logic, how come the US didn't veto it back then? You can find the list of vetoed UNSC resolutions here. 

If you had look at the list yourself you could have seen nearly every US veto includes Palestine and Israel. Also which resolution is that because I couldn't find it?

&gt;Yet another false statement. Nowhere in the documents will you find a section that requests the Republic of Armenia to withdraw forces.

Wrong it says ""withdrawal of occupying forces"" and this includes Armenian forces as well. ""Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh included 8,000 volunteers from Armenia itself; Armenia's military in the report was exclusively made up of members in the army."" Armenia went with Spain strategy in WW2 send armies but made sure they are ""volunteers"" not part of your army.

Some would stay, Dublin is probably a good place to do business, but definitely not all of them. So some of that ""fake"" GDP should vanish. If it was true that those holes had been closed.

691,"Network engineers.

Bits are relevant to transport information through the physical world, so information amounts directly related to the lower layers of the [OSI model](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model) (and especially layer 1) are measured in bits. A cable doesn't care about the complexity of the content, it only cares about accurately transmitting one bit after the other. Another example are streams and online videos - it is irrelevant how big a video is, only that you can load it faster than you watch it. That's why streaming services state their minimum required bandwidth in bit/s. 

Bytes are more relevant for computer programs (higher OSI layers), since having to manage memory on a bit level would be a nightmare - a bit can only hold ""0"" and ""1"" while a byte can hold a letter or a small three digit number. So all application related storage information is measured in bytes. Since all day-to-day interactions of regular users with a computer take place on OSI layer 7, users are seldom confronted with bits.

Also this helps to avoid confusion about overhead and throughput. During data transmission, information is added to the transmitted data that contains things like ip and mac addresses, the used protocol and control information to smooth the paket flow (all this is called called overhead). This information must be transmitted for the transmission to work, but takes bandwidth away from the actual data. Again - this is irrelevant on the bit layer, since all bits are equal. But since your ISP doesn't know what protocols you are going to use, therefore how much overhead is generated and how much bandwidth will be used for overhead info, they can't guarantee content throughput - only bit throughput.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/h9mk6s/europe_by_internet_speed/fuye5ut/,SeeSebbb,1592263020

We know everything about WW2, the names Hitler, Stalin, Roosevelt, Churchill, Mussolini are known by every schoolkid, we know dates, we know the meaning behind cities as Nagasaki, Hiroshima, Berlin, Dresden, Tokyo, Stalingrad, Hamburg, Pfrozheim, and like.

The Thirty Years War (30YW) was a conflict which happened some 10 generations ago, we have few if any monuments, people know little about it, few can name any military leaders of Sweden, Palantine, or Mantua, nobody has any family photographs of family members who died in the battles, etc.  30YW is not within our psyche.

747,"&gt;It was Michel who made the reality clear — albeit with a confusing mixed metaphor: “Ready to put a tiger in the tank but not to buy a pig in a poke. Level playing field is essential.”

I don't believe that that's a mixed metaphor.  It's just two metaphors in a sentence.

To be a mixed metaphor, the two would have to interact within their literal meanings and screw up the metaphorical meaning.

Example mixed metaphor: ""Don't count your chickens before they hatch unless you want them all to be in one basket.""

That's mixing ""don't put all your eggs in one basket"" (a metaphor for not letting everything rely on a single thing that might go wrong — like a dropped basket of eggs breaking them) with ""don't count your chickens before they hatch"" (a metaphor for not relying on something that might go wrong going right before it actually goes right, like eggs failing to hatch).  The literal meaning of both is about eggs, so having those interact literally mucks up the metaphor.

But as-stated, that's not what Michel's sentence does.  Each metaphor is complete and stands alone and its proper metaphorical meaning is achieved.

If he'd said something like ""we want to put the tiger in the tank and the pig anywhere but the poke"", that'd be a mixed metaphor that would be somewhat-similar to his sentence.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/h9nbqm/brexit_summit_tigers_and_pigs_but_no_fish/fuxxvpb/,duisThias,1592255240

865,"&gt; The Social Democratic Party of Hungary merged with the Hungarian Communist Party and their politicians actively participated in the creation of the Hungarian Soviet Republic.

That is not the whole story:

&gt;the newly united Socialist Party created a government called the Revolutionary Governing Council, which proclaimed the Hungarian Soviet Republic and dismissed President Károlyi on 21 March. **The liberal president Károlyi was arrested by the new Communist government on the first day**; in July 1919 he managed to make his escape and flee to Paris.[11] **On 23 March, Lenin gave an order to Béla Kun that Social Democrats must be removed from power**, so that Hungary could be transformed into a true communist state ruled by a ""dictatorship of the proletariat"". Accordingly, the Communists started to purge the Social Democrats from the government on the next day.

They tried to built a country in the aftermath of WW1, and within 3 days, Lenin ordered the communists to betray them. That's literally the opposite of what you are claiming.

&gt; The Social Democratic Party of Hungary again merged with the Hungarian Communist Party to create the Hungarian Working People's Party.

That also happened in East Germany under the pressure of the soviets. That wasn't a voluntary decision, but a forced procedure where all social democrats where purged and the party ceased to exist.  The party you are accusing of building a regime actually worked in secret and organized the 1956 revolt, only to be beaten into underground by the soviets again.

Or consider low income housing residents whose individual financial situation is exploited by multi-billion dollar property developers.  They are just happy to have a place to live and could care less that their financial difficulties were used by some unknown wealthy people to make enormous profit.

Oh, yes, I know this very well. I don't see big problem here, after all lies that many Germans have been spreading here about Ukraine.

&gt; Ukraine does objectively not qualify as a NATO member at this point. No  German conspiracy is keeping it out, requirements for NATO membership  are simply not met by your country.  

There is a procedure to get qualified, it's called membership plan and it's blocked by appeasing countries, including Germany.

&gt; 11,5% of Ukrainian imports stem from Russia. Just 2% of German imports  do. Relative to its size, Ukraine is a shockingly evil collaborator with  criminals, if trade counts as collaboration. That's obviously not the  case, just like Germany is not the evil boogeyman you imagine because it  tolerates that Gazprom builds a pipeline. 

 Ukraine also does not cooperate with Russia to build new infrastructure designed to undermine other states. Obviously Ukraine can not replace all imported goods from Russia immediately (if you look at dynamics trade volume decreases with time).

&gt; I'll ignore your ramblings regarding what you think ""Realpolitik"" is. They contribute nothing of substance. 

Realpolitik is when somebody says you ""oh, yes you are right, but we still do whatever we want and we don't care about you"".

I refuse to allow LGBT peoples rights to be used as a tool against Poland, they are way too important for that. 

The world is complex, and achieving lasting social change is complex and hard. The current EU approach is not achieving lasting change, but damaging this very proces, while pretending to care.

And if you're talking specifically about EU bureaucrats taking UK bureaucrat jobs, then you make it seem like a bad thing. Don't you want LESS bureaucrats in total? In which case, the EU does exactly that.

And also, the UK was part of the EU. Which means UK citizens also worked for the EU, and that created jobs for UK citizens.

And also also, a lot of businesses in the UK are gonna close if they haven't already, so that's gonna impact jobs much more significantly.

The more you dig into Brexit's claims of creating jobs for the UK, the more it falls apart.

IMO the only way the UK could survive Brexit without serious long-term damage is CANZUK. And I actually like that, even if I think the UK staying in the EU is better. I don't want the UK to fall apart, and CANZUK would actually be fantastic for everyone involved, it might even be better for Britain long-term than being in the EU, I don't know (it would still have a Northern Ireland problem but whatever).

&gt;Beating up people is bad. But there is beating people for not liking them, and there is beating up people for being fascists.

&gt;You draw an equivalence between two completely different types of violence.

Again, no there isn't. You're merely rationalizing violence towards people whose ideology you despise. Do we not live in a civilized and modern society where fair representation and punishment through the judicial system takes precedent over vigilante justice and lynching?

Rokossovsky: Yes, but the Germans are going out of their way to eliminate them. It is very difficult for us to keep them, and we are losing a lot of people. Keep in mind that we have more than two months of continuous fighting behind us. We have liberated all of Belarus and almost a quarter of Poland; but the Red Army can get tired at times. Our losses were very high.

Werth: Can't you help the Warsaw rebels from the air?

Rokossovsky: We are trying to do this, but in truth, it is of little use. The insurgents have established themselves only in certain points in Warsaw, and most of the cargo falls to the Germans.

Werth: Why can't you allow British and American planes to land behind Russian lines after they drop their cargo in Warsaw? Your refusal caused a great uproar in England and America…

Rokossovsky: the Military situation in the area East of the Vistula is much more complex than you imagine. And we don't want British and American planes to be there right now in addition to everything else. I think that in a couple of weeks we will be able to supply Warsaw ourselves with our low-flying planes, if the rebels have any discernible area of territory in the city from the air. But dropping cargo in Warsaw from a high altitude, as the allied planes do, is almost completely useless.

Rokossovsky: The home Army command made a terrible mistake. We \[the Red Army\] are conducting military operations in Poland, we are the force that will liberate the whole of Poland within the next few months, and Bur-Komorovsky and his henchmen have stumbled in here like a red-haired man in a circus — like that clown who appears in the arena at the most inopportune moment and is wrapped in a carpet… If it were just a matter of clowning, it would not matter at all, but it is a political gamble, and this gamble will cost Poland hundreds of thousands of lives. This is a terrible tragedy, and now they are trying to shift all the blame for it to us.

1364,"There are many reasons besides stereotypes. First of all, Estonia is economically far behind the Nordic countries. Your median salary as well as GDP per capita are less than half of those in the Nordic countries.

Another factor is that your views are, on average, not aligned with those of the Nordic countries. For example, the Eurobarometer on Discrimination 2019 shows that Estonian views of LGBT people are far more outdated compared to Sweden, Denmark and Finland. I am pretty sure that most other comparisons of opinions would group you with Eastern European nations rather than the Nordic countries as well.

Even though there are some cultural similarities between Estonia and the Nordic countries, the gap is still quite large. If I travel from Finland to Sweden, pretty much the only thing that changes is the language. Even that is not a huge difference as we have been taught Swedish for years in school and I hear Swedish every single time I walk near the city center here in Finland. You most likely don't even realise how tied the cultures between the Nordic countries are. Even the non-Swedish speaking Finns sing drinking songs like Helan går in Swedish, hold crayfish parties in August, celebrate Saint Lucy's day in December, etc. When I take the ferry to Tallinn, it feels like going back two or three decades and removing the Swedish influences on the culture.

I know that it is common in Estonia to group the country with the Nordic countries, and I hate to break the bubble, but nobody in the Nordic countries considers Estonian Nordic.",Finland,/r/europe/comments/h8pi8n/pisa_2018_european_ranking/fuvw1ss/,aenc,1592212475

1376,"I know, however, in 1865, a french cartographer (I think his name was Mieulet) decided he didn't care and draw a different border that ""annexed"" some Italian bits.

Despite the French unofficially recognizing the 1860 whenever ""serious stuff"" is involved (i.e. construction sites for the Monte Bianco Tunnel, Skyway cable car, etc) they still officially stick to their 1865 version of the border and sometimes the French Gendarmerie is kind of a dick and, in some occasions, stopped Italian alpinists that were climbing on the Italian side by applying french regulations. Basically, they acted as if the border was where their maps say.

Funny enough, some of the top Italian and French cartography/history experts and alpine guides agree on the fact that the border is indeed the one shown in the Italian maps.

TL;DR: In 1865 the french ""stole"" some bits of land by simply drawing the border differently. Basically everyone agrees on the fact that the correct border is the one from 1860 but the French are too proud to admit it (and it does not make such a great difference) and so they ignore that.",,/r/europe/comments/h8t5jq/territorial_disputes_on_europe/fuvw5sz/,TheAlpsGuy,1592212589

Not counting microstates it is Switzerland, with 125km of track per 1,000 km^2 (5,196km in total).

The city became part of Romania.

 The total period during which border control is reintroduced at internal borders, including any prolongation provided for under paragraph 3 of this Article, shall not exceed six months. Where there are exceptional circumstances as referred to in Article 29, that total period may be extended to a maximum length of \*\*two years\*\*, in accordance with paragraph 1 of that Article. 

Emphasis mine

That period may be prolonged, \*\*no more than three times\*\*, for a further period of up to six months if the exceptional circumstances persist.

But the whole article 29 is basically a cop-out for the whole Schengen treaty. So I say it again: Schengen is a joke. The way it is written now, countries can always find a scapegoat motivation (terrorism, immigration, economic costs, excessive export of smorrebrod) to suspend Schengen and still enjoy the common market, which, when the UK pushed for it, the EU ate their face.

Again if you « Knew so much about WWI », then you would’ve known the exact reason why the US did not just invade Japan. The entire reason (which was clearly valid), that due to how ruthless Kamikazie and Bonzai attacks had gotten when the US soldiers kept advancing towards mainland Japan, the US figured that invading Japan would be so deadly, ruthless and destructive, that they would not be able to take the death toll.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handover_of_Hong_Kong

&gt;The United Kingdom obtained control over portions of Hong Kong's territory through three treaties concluded with Qing China after the Opium Wars: 
&gt;
&gt;* 1842 Treaty of Nanking: Hong Kong Island ceded in perpetuity
&gt;
&gt;* 1860 Convention of Peking: Kowloon Peninsula and Stonecutter's Island additionally ceded
&gt;
&gt;* 1898 Convention for the Extension of Hong Kong Territory: the New Territories and outlying islands leased for 99 years until 1997
&gt;
&gt;Despite the finite nature of the New Territories lease, this portion of the colony was developed just as rapidly as, and became highly integrated with, the rest of Hong Kong. As the end of the lease approached, and by the time of serious negotiations over the future status of Hong Kong in the 1980s, it was thought impractical to separate the ceded territories and return only the New Territories to China. In addition, with the scarcity of land and natural resources in Hong Kong Island and Kowloon, large-scale infrastructure investments had been made in the New Territories, with break-evens lying well past 30 June 1997.[5]

-

&gt; Margaret Thatcher, in discussion with Deng Xiaoping, reiterated the validity of an extension of the lease of Hong Kong territory, particularly in light of binding treaties, including the Treaty of Nanking in 1842, the Convention of Peking in 1856, and the Convention for the Extension of Hong Kong Territory signed in 1890. 
&gt;
&gt;In response, Deng Xiaoping cited clearly the lack of room for compromise on the question of sovereignty over Hong Kong; the PRC, as the successor of Qing dynasty and the Republic of China on the mainland, would recover the entirety of the New Territories, Kowloon and Hong Kong Island. China considered treaties about Hong Kong as unequal and ultimately refused to accept any outcome that would indicate permanent loss of sovereignty over Hong Kong's area, whatever wording the former treaties had.[15]
&gt;
&gt;During talks with Thatcher, China planned to invade and seize Hong Kong if the negotiations set off unrest in the colony. Thatcher later said that Deng told her bluntly that China could easily take Hong Kong by force, stating that ""I could walk in and take the whole lot this afternoon"", to which she replied that ""there is nothing I could do to stop you, but the eyes of the world would now know what China is like"".[16]",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/h8t5jq/territorial_disputes_on_europe/fuvbqjm/,duisThias,1592194936

1692,"The moral equivalence you were doing is just wrong though. 

China's camps are absolutely worse and their function is different, so Europe literally does have the moral high ground here. 

The people in the European camps aren't being worked to death, they're not being ""re-educated"", you could say they're there against their will, but they actually **are** free to leave, just not in the direction they want. The people in Chinese camps do not have any of these luxuries. 

Another one people like to bring up is the Japanese Internment camps Americans had, but that's also really disingenuous. They were definitely a shameful moment and shouldn't have happened, but... more people came out of those camps than went into them (due to births during imprisonment). 

They were even *paid* for working, yes their wages were very low, but the point is, it was very different from going to a place like Auschwitz II Birkenau so it would actually be really disrespectful to Holocaust victims to compare them. 

But even comparing China's camps to Nazi extermination camps is still wrong since China's camps are not, as far as we know, extermination camps. If I say the Uyghur camps aren't like the holocaust though I'll probably be downvoted because people will think I'm ""defending"" China.

&gt; The UN rights chief provided examples of the pandemic’s impact on various communities in several countries in the Americas and Europe.

&gt;For example, in Brazil’s São Paulo state, people of colour are 62 per cent more likely to die from COVID-19 than their white counterparts. Higher mortality rates have also been reported in the Seine Saint-Denis department in France, home to many minorities.

&gt;Meanwhile, data from the United States shows that the COVID-19 death rate for African Americans is more than double that of other racial groups.

&gt;The situation is practically mirrored in England and Wales, where the death rate for black, Pakistani and Bangladeshi people is nearly double that of white people, even when class and some health factors are taken into account.

&gt;  ""This virus is exposing endemic inequalities that have too long been ignored. In the United States, protests triggered by the killing of George Floyd are highlighting not only police violence against people of colour, but also inequalities in health, education, employment and endemic racial discrimination”, the High Commissioner said.

Regarding neoliberalism, that's a fair point of comparison. That said, other European nations have embraced neoliberalism to varying degrees in the same period we have. Interestingly, one of the central crticisms among some *leftwing* EU-sceptics is they believe the EU has become a neoliberal project ( [this is an interesting article outlining the critism](https://nplusonemag.com/online-only/online-only/the-origins-of-european-neoliberalism/) ). So I don't know if in 2020 the UK has an economic policy which marks it out from all of Europe as distinctly American (could go further in that direction post-Brexit, of course).  
  
Five Eyes can be seen as evidence of the so-called [Special Relationship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Relationship) between the UK and the USA. I don't know if that distinct diplomatic alliance makes us 'the US of Europe', rather than just *different*.   
    
I've never heard anybody suggest CANZUK be extended to the USA, personally - I've only heard it touted as an equivalent of the EEC for the major Commonwealth countries.

The sweater on the first guy to the right, is what you would usually see someone wear when fishing. It is similar to the Icelandic variants, though distinctive in the patterns knitted as decorations. What really stood out to me was the buttoned shirt which they all seem to be wearing variants of. This looks to be the coat worn with the national dress. This would be wierd in and of itself, but seeing as how they are all wearing the traditional hat to go along with the national dress, this photo might just be staged to show how the faroese peoples live.

1829,"\&gt; Is Hungary anti-immigration for all foreigners then?  

They don't need to be anti-immigration. No one sane would stay if they didn't have family. The government is pro-saying-whatever-gets-votes, and that includes a healthy amount of generic xenophobia. In the case of westerners, this goes to depicting their governments as undermining the country.

\&gt;  How many European countries have you been to?  Is the bigotry all the same there? 

Lived in more than on one hand, but less than on two. And no, again, region specific. Romanian though is a shit card to have generally, not a good reputation anywhere.

\&gt; So you think America would be better off not doing a census asking people for race?   Do most places in Europe not ask for racial statistics? 

Absolutely. Most European countries do ethnic, not racial, statistics. And France does neither, and it's actually illegal to do racial statistics, since it's considered racist. 

\&gt; I’m not sure if the media played this up, but It does seem that populism became more prominent in Italy due to the African Migrants; Germany and Sweden due to Muslim Migrants; and the UK due to South Asian migrants 

For Italy it was the sudden North African illegal migration. Germany has a history of it with, in order, Turkish workers migration in the 70s, Yugoslav migration in the 90s, New Member migration in the 2000s and now Middle Eastern migration, every time the same shit happens, because germany hasn't gone full assimilationist, they still feel uncomfortable calling anyone not German by 10 generations German. Sweden is doing its own weird thing. And the UK has no problem with South Asian migrants since 1980, it mostly disliked Eastern Europeans.

Really, the two things that have made things worse in Europe has been: sudden migrations (either of Eastern Europeans or Middle Easterners) and the muslim radicalization of 2000s and 2010s. But we've done this dance before, with communist and fascist radicalization of the 1970s, and the worker migrations from the Middle East, Turkey, and North Africa. It passes.

Trump, Brexit and Bojo are the anglosphere having an epileptic fit caused by english twitter, 4chan and PR agencies.

\&gt; Aren’t Europeans more likely to accept you if you’re an EU citizen which gives a right to movement over someone from Africa and the Middle East?

A legal right doesn't automatically translate to tolerance let alone acceptance. But in most places I'd likely have the advantage over someone from Africa or the Middle East. It's more complicated in France or the UK, where both are better represented.  


\&gt; When you say you’re Romanian, is that the same group as Roma?  

No, and that's exactly half of the problem. The other half being that ethnic Romanians can be just as bad as ethnic Roma.

Like, if a neo nazi says they wish all those filthy refugees down the street were dead and in his mind he has plans to burn the refugee home down then is it your foremost duty to educate him and bring him to the right path or try to save lives at all cost, possibly by making him feel unsafe or at least that there will be repercussions.

Yes, and there are hundreds of survivors.

Why do people always somehow forget the hundreds of survivors when using how many houses were in the tower as a metric for how many died.

If you're arguing everyone who lived there died, then it's hundreds dead.

If we acknowledge the hundreds of survivors, the figure doesn't look odd. iirc there were 120 units in the tower and keeping in mind that in any block a decent number are studios or granny flats, hundreds of survivors and 70+ dead isn't a conspiracy tier low number.

I say that as someone whose nan lives on the 19th floor of a block within a mile of Grenfell that's currently having its cladding taken off.

2058,"Rolls-Royce triggers £250bn nuclear race: Huge boost for economy if UK consortium gets go-ahead to build fleet of mini reactor plants

*By Neil Craven, Financial Mail on Sunday
21:54, 13 Jun 2020 , updated 10:47, 14 Jun 2020*


A consortium of British businesses led by manufacturing giant Rolls-Royce has submitted proposals to Ministers to accelerate the building of a new fleet of mini nuclear reactors in the North of England. 

The plans, circulated in Whitehall 'in the last few weeks', could see construction of high-tech factories to build the small reactors begin by next year. 

The consortium – which includes UK construction and engineering firms Laing O'Rourke, Atkins and BAM Nuttall – would use British intellectual property to build the reactors. It would work with partners from the US, Canada and France. 

It has been estimated that exporting small nuclear reactor technology could be worth £250billion to the UK if the programme is successful. 

Sources told The Mail on Sunday that the plan is 'starting to resonate' in parts of Government because it could boost the economy as the country recovers from the destruction wrought by the pandemic. 


Figures last week showed the economy contracted by 20.4 per cent in April and job losses in the travel, hospitality and retail sectors are mounting. 

Sixteen Rolls-Royce-backed reactors, each able to power a city the size of Leeds, could be built by 2050. The project would employ 40,000 people. 

Hundreds of related jobs would be created this year if the Government gives the green light. 

The plan to deliver British-made nuclear reactors would help the Government to meet the UK's commitment to shift to clean energy by 2050


It would also appeal to Tory MPs keen to reduce Britain's reliance on China. Chinese firms are currently appointed to build large nuclear reactors in Britain at locations including Sizewell in Suffolk and Bradwell in Essex. 

However, there are growing concerns among senior Tories about Chinese influence over critical infrastructure in the UK. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has indicated his intention to distance the UK from China economically, amid talk of phasing out Huawei's involvement in Britain's new 5G mobile internet network. 

Meanwhile, Chancellor Rishi Sunak is under pressure to announce measures to boost the economy in his mini-Budget next month and in his full-blown recovery Budget pencilled in for the autumn. Formal backing from the Government would propel the project into activity, says Tom Samson, interim chief executive of the consortium. 


He told The Mail on Sunday: 'We could be looking at locations and beginning to build factories as soon as next year with modules [to build the reactors] starting to come out of the factories by 2024 or 2025. 

'We've got over 100 people today working on the programme. It could generate hundreds more jobs even this year. As soon as we get the signal we'll be able to start ramping up our activities on engineering, planning and project management.' 

The so-called small modular reactors (SMR) would be manufactured piece by piece in factories before being transported to approved sites for assembly. The production line process allows reactors to be built more cheaply. It is understood that the cost of building each one will fall to £1.8billion after the first handful are constructed. 


The rollout plans submitted to officials require £500 million of funding with the Government putting up half. That investment would follow an initial outlay of £36 million made last year, with half provided by Government. 

Samson said the plan 'could deliver near-term economic benefits as part of the economic recovery'. He said: 'We can do a number of things in parallel. We can develop the technology, we can be preparing sites to host the SMR across the UK, we can also look at where the factories could be and start to look at what commitments are needed to commence construction.' 

Most of Britain's eight large-scale nuclear power plants are due to close within a decade. The sites under consideration for the new project include Moorside in Cumbria and Wylfa in North Wales, where plans for future large reactor projects were recently shelved. 

Samson said: 'We want to become a champion of that clean energy space and I think, equally compelling, is the potential to connect the SMR programme to the production of industrial heat applications, synthetic fuels and aviation fuels being deployed in our engines, not just to provide energy into the grid. 

'It's not unrealistic for us to be focusing on bringing on the first unit by 2029.

2064,"The article:

&gt;In 2010, Maxwell Itoya, a 36-year-old Nigerian who sold shoes in an open-air market in Warsaw, Poland, was shot dead by a Polish police officer in controversial circumstances. Despite the fact that Itoya was unarmed and had no criminal record, the officer claimed the Nigerian lunged for his service weapon following a heated verbal exchange, prompting him to shoot in self-defense. But Nigerian witnesses present told a different story, saying the policeman had shot without any warning following his exchange with Itoya.

Wikipedia:

&gt;Itoya worked as a street vendor at an open-air market in the Praga district of Warsaw selling counterfeit shoes.[1] Itoya had been living in Poland for eight years[1] and was married to a Pole with whom he had three children.[2] On 23 May 2010, there was an action of Polish Police on a market to curb down on illegal and black market trade. After one of the traders was asked for documents and refused to give them, police arrested him. Itoya interrupted and asked why[3][4]. Afterwards, Itoya died after being shot by police.[1] 32 immigrant traders were rounded up and arrested, including 29 Nigerians, one Cameroonian, one Guinean and one Indian.[1] The police and press described this as a riot.[1]

&gt;The exact reason for the lethal shot being fired is unclear: police sources said that it was an accident and took place during a riot that started when vendors were checked for documents and thus Itoya was being arrested; according to witness' accounts the riot only started after the police opened fire.[5]",,/r/europe/comments/h8r02d/europe_needs_to_talk_about_race_too/futr8yq/,fornocompensation,1592161921

**P**ythagoras was born on the Greek island of Samos, in the eastern Aegean Sea off the coast of Turkey, some circa 570 BC. His father Mnesarchus a Phoenician merchant from Tyre; his mother was Pythais, a native of Samos. He spent his early years in Samos, but also traveled widely with his father as a merchant at sea. He was granted citizenship in Samos for supplying them with necessary food when they were undergoing a difficult famine. [Onion Knight](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Davos_Seaworth), anyone?

According to some reports, as a young man he met Thales of Miletus, who interestingly was also likely Phoenician by birth. Thales was impressed with his abilities and advised him to head to Memphis in Egypt and study mathematics and astronomy with the priests there, which he soon had the opportunity of. He also traveled to study at the temples of Tyre and Byblos in Phoenicia, as well as in Babylon. At some point he was also a student of Pherecydes of Syros and of Anaximander (who himself had been a student of Thales). While still quite a young man, he left his native city for Croton in southern Italy in order to escape the tyrannical government of Polycrates, the Tyrant of Samos (or possibly to escape political problems related to an Egyptian-style school called the ""semicircle"" which he had founded on Samos).

And of course, Pythagoras is credited with inventing the Pythagorean Theorem.

2114,"&gt;Germany effectively lost the war without any real possibility of comeback in Stalingrad at the end of 1942. Anything delivered after that probably still helped defeat the Nazis, but Germany was bound to lose at that point anyway.

Objectively, Germany lost the war before it even started it. But it is all understood in a hindsight, with the whole set of facts at hands.

However what these facts also show, is that the Soviets in the East were far closer to the defeat than the common belief dictates. World War 2 was decided less in battles and more at the assembling line. 
 Whichever country could better sustain the pressure, maintain the supply line and had greater manpower efficiency would win in the end. It was essentially a same type of war as World War I, just with more mobile formations.

And now the point is, the war was **not over by 1942**. It took on an order of magnitude more resources to bring down Germany from 1943 to 1945, than it took to stand the ground in 1939-1942. Even with Lend-Lease the Soviets struggled, and even with all other variables in place they had spent unsustainable amount of manpower to recover what was essentially a scorched ground, and neared the bottom of their manpower pool as early as 1944.

Effects of 500+ would be achieved by lowering the taxes, and they would be nationwide, not only for those who have kids, menawhile they added or increased over 30 different taxes. 500+ target was to increase average children number per family.

2187,"Limiting terms and staggering them is a solution to #2, but not to #1 and #3. 

Judges are special because they are supposed to be impartial and responsible to the law, rather than to anyone else. 

Thus, neither politicians (because of partisanship) nor the people (because of tyranny of the majority) should be electing the members of such committee/association. But that committee should also has its powers strictly limited.

Let's look at 3 different situations:

A. The judge is going against the law (senile, corrupt, etc.) The people and some proportion of the politicians are unhappy but other judges may see his/her removal as a threat.

B. The judge stays within the law but rules with (or without) certain political agenda. Ruling party and some proportion of the people are unhappy.

C. The judge stays within the law but he/she makes decisions unpopular with the majority of population - going against majority religion, giving rights to hated minority etc. Many of those people are unhappy, and some portion of politicians exploits that.

How can we make sure that A is impeached but B and C are not?

Your proposal (externally appointed members) still makes removal of B and C easy while not guaranteeing A, because one party or coalition can stay in power longer than 2 election cycles.

Instead, #1 and #3 should be addressed by strictly limiting the  power of the committee and potential for corruption (*elected* internally, with short/rotating term limits as you described). And impeachment should require cooperation of powers: legislative branch (OR large petition brought to legislative branch) brings the impeachment, and judicial body must investigate it and conclude whether the law was broken. If they agree, the judge is impeached.

This allows everyone to agree on A (judges are placated by the fact that their removal should be lawful) but prevents removal of B and C. 

The vulnerability here is the situation where most judges are corrupt and will protect even A as ""lawful"" despite being elected and rotated. But in society that rotten, most politicians are usually also corrupt, so keeping B and C might be still worth it.",⚑ For the glory of Chaos ⚑,/r/europe/comments/h8u6wq/26_years_ago_young_belarusian_president_alexander/futem9l/,Idiocracy_Cometh,1592155029

2271,"I have not heard of this from any Americans and Canadians that I know. Actually I have never heard anything good about West Virginia other than the John Denver song. Historically people are moving from rural areas to cities rather than the other way around.

Vest Virginia is one of the US states where the least amount of people want to live, and have huge issues with outmigration. It is the highest shrinking State in the US, with massive amounts of people are leaving for more desirable states, and on top of that more deaths than births with an aging population while young people continue to flee the State. It doesn't have many jobs. It has one of the highest unemployment rates in the US and 19% of the population lives in poverty. People aren't really moving anywhere like that.

There are people here moving to cheaper countries, retiring in Spain, etc. But it would be amiss to compare those countries to the horrid situation in West Virginia.

To give you a short summary of the party:
Very conservative, very connected to the polish church ( a lot of money went that way during their current reign ) and to the concept of a traditional family - which, in their belief, is a man, woman ( without any possibility of an abortion whatsoever ) and a couple of kids - all of course on the board of the christianity train. 

When they started to rule they also started to destroy our judiciary system - we’ve got a couple of battles against the UE now in terms of that, but their essential goal is to have all the judges under their rule, and, unfortunately, they are almost on the finishing line.

Looking on the International scale - USA yes, hurray, allies, love and friendship. Germany, Russia, France etc - nay, bad nations, still want to destroy Poland. 

So, that’s that in a nutshell - always happy to have a longer chat on this topic, if you’ve got any questions.

Also, don’t get me wrong, Poland is very polarized now - I’m expecting to see at least on post soon under this conversation saying how PIS is perfect, so remember it’s just my opinion.

2341,"&gt; I must say as an LGBT person that I strongly agree that a medical diagnosis should be needed in order to change one's gender identity. I strongly support people's right to live their life how they want to, but given that we are very often dealing with young people making what will be one of the biggest decisions of their lives, I do think some caution in the process is needed. 

[Ireland and some places in the USA disagree with you.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_the_Republic_of_Ireland#Gender_identity_and_expression)

&gt;On 15 July 2015, the Gender Recognition Act 2015 (Irish: An tAcht um Inscne a Aithint, 2015) with major amendments passed both houses of the Oireachtas and President Michael D. Higgins signed the bill into law on 22 July 2015.[50][87][88] The law allows legal gender changes without the requirement of medical intervention or assessment by the state. Such change is possible through self-determination for any person aged 18 or over, resident in Ireland and registered on Irish registers. The law came into effect on 8 September 2015.[89]


Also, I think some caution is needed but I disagree with psychological evaluation being a requirement, I think it should be suggested but not a requirement. 

Isn't that one of the reasons for the  2+ years long waiting times in the UK?

Higgins signed the bill into law on 22 July 2015.[50][87][88] The law allows legal gender changes without the requirement of medical intervention or assessment by the state. Such change is possible through self-determination for any person aged 18 or over, resident in Ireland and registered on Irish registers.

Geothermal plants are cool but doesn’t work everywhere.

I won’t even talk about burning thermal powerplants.

Modern designs of nuclear powerplants shut down by design even if everything goes wrong. They can turn down the production as fast as thermal powerplants. By the way, it produces a shit ton of energy.

2411,"Not OP, but the best sources for the German casualties are Zetterling and Overman, and Krivosheev as for the Soviet casualties (except for the number of death in captivities).

According to Overman in  *Deutsche militärische Verluste im Zweiten Weltkrieg* **, 5.3 million of Germans were killed, among which 4.1 millions were on the eastern, including around 1 million death in captivities and 1.2 millions died on the western front (including 100 000 in captivities, 25.000 of which died in French camps)**. This is a high estimation, Overmans worked on the archives of the Deutsche Dienststelle, a government agency that keeps the service records of the 18.3 million Germans who served in the armed forces, in the form of cards. Of these 18.3M, there are 3.1M soldiers declared dead in service. He analyzed the remaining 15.2M cards from a sample and found that 14.4% of them had no longer shown any sign of life to the administration after the war. This makes 2.2M missing, presumed war dead by Overmans. This method is criticized by Niklas Zetterling as among the 2.2M missing, there are not only those killed on duty or in prison camps, but also deserters, prisoners who chose to stay abroad (especially in the USA), war criminals on the run, people who died of natural death or disease... 

For Soviet casualties, according to the study of General Grigori Krivosheev and his team of researchers, published in the West in 1993 as *Soviet Casualties and Combat Losses in the Twentieth Century,* **the Soviets lost 8.7 million soldiers killed: 6.9M dead on duty, 0.5M missing presumed killed, and 1.3M dead in German prison camps.** Thought most historians estimate that about 3.5 million soldiers died in captivity (out of about 5.5M taken), not 1.3M, once corrected, those numbers reach **10.9 million of soldier killed**.

This figure was obtained from reports sent by the Fronts to Moscow and kept in the archives, they are only estimations for the particularly chaotic period of 1941-42, and the number of prisoners repatriated in 1945 (1.8M).

So the figures are pretty skewed toward the Soviet Union.",France,/r/europe/comments/h8pnzu/lets_not_forget/fushcaq/,Illya-ehrenbourg,1592132712

2500,"\&gt; Direction matters, Russia move from Europe and expanded, Turks came from central Asia. 

Okay boyo, let me correct the basket case you got there. Firstly, neither Russia or Muscovy before it was in Europe until Russia pushed for the broadening of the eastern border of Europe in 1850 to it's furthest east possible interpretation, so that it would include Moscow and they can give amunition to people who like to argue trivia facts and technicalities in its favour. Before that \[there were several competing definitions\](  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundaries\_between\_the\_continents\_of\_Earth#/media/File:Historical\_Europe-Asia\_boundaries\_1700\_to\_1900.png](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundaries_between_the_continents_of_Earth#/media/File:Historical_Europe-Asia_boundaries_1700_to_1900.png) ) the oldest one being delimiting Europe at the Don.

\&gt; Russia is Christian additonally, so it belong to the Occidental cultures. Turkey is oriental, with Occidental elements, See Atatürk failing secularisation efforts.

This might be mindblowing to you but not all Christian Culture is the same. The extension goes with Islamic culture. Both Russia and the Ottoman Empire derived their influences not from your idealic image of what ""Christian Culture"" might mean (probably with all the greko-roman pagan work that actually makes Europe work) but from Byzantine Culture. Byzantine Culture was imperial, and caesaro-papist. And it is by no small coincidence that both Russia and the Ottomans were centralist empires with rules with religious roles. 

This lack of understanding in the difference between Occidental Christianity(Catholic or Protestant) and Oriental Christianity is annoyingly common in the sort of bigotry which likes to paint us all as one big happy family in hopes of getting some of their xenophobia out there.

2507,"Hm, I used to be in the German army and shoot with P1 (pistol), G3 (rifle), MG3 (machine gun) and MP3 (submachine gun) and a some more special things.

For me, hitting with pistol and submachine gun was always no issue at all ... and so it was for most of my comrades. The distances are really near. With G3 things were quite different ...

So when I see violence-ridden US movies (""Hey, we have a problem. Sure, let's use violence to solve this problem!"") they all the time shot with their pistols to targets near of them ... and they almost never hit. To me, this is so ridiculous.

So my taking away from this is that a german police officer that doesn't have too much training is maybe ...

For a comparison, the USA has only about 4x more people than Germany. So if your numbers were only 4x as high as Germany's, we'd be in the same boat. Similarly, NY has only about 2x as much population as Berlin.

It's not a medical condition/birth defect for mainstream lgbt communities but it's literally a fashion/political statement. If one randomly started saying that they identify as a diabetic/disabled but they actually weren't diabetic/disabled, people would say that it's bullshit and harmful behavior, but if the same people claim to be trans in the exact same situation then that's fine and not problematic...

If the damage to the Perle is significant enough that repairs are impossible or excessively expensive, the French Navy may have to keep its other Rubis vessels in service longer and/or accelerate construction of the Suffren class.

Wow, so either run the existing subs a bit longer or speed up the construction of new ones to replace. What a remarkably 'rethink' of France's strategy!

3061,"&gt;If you want to talk about how access to money affects this kind of thing, doesn't it then follow that they would *also* be more active in these ""non-mainstream"" realms, because there's more money to invest overall and people have more disposable income?

It would certainly suggest that you're also more visible there. But money is not as portant there. I'd argue that in those areas ideas and concepts compete more than money, and I certainly believe that cultures often breed ideas. The art world is more diverse by nature, because art created from different backgrounds is just more interesting.


&gt;Or did you think that all Americans are only interested in consuming blockbuster movies and fast food, just because that's the things the rest of the world adopts from them so universally? It's so easily exportable *because* the rest of the world loves it so much.

I mean that last part is pretty much what I said, so I'm not sure how you managed to turn it around like that. America stepped in with big money to produce mainstream entertainment when Europe was in shambles. The U.S. pretty much defined how we expect mainstream entertainment to look, etc. And I argue that's where the U.S. is actually dominant. 


&gt;I know so many Germans who simply do not consume contemporary German culture, be it music, TV, films, art, comedy. In their own words, it's simply not of good quality.

I don't know them, so I can't judge, but I think the reason for that is that they're not actually looking for anything there. Maybe quality for them is production quality. Maybe they're to used to mainstream U.S. entertainment to deal with how different German cultural output often is. Maybe they have so many international friends that they just prioritize the shared experiences.

Small tangent, but do you realize how many foreigners actually practice their craft in America, because of better funding and access to international audiences? Often especially talented creators do that. Guillermo del Toro, Roland Emmerich and Nicolas Winding Refn were all born and raised and learned to make movies in Europe. In a sense, many things coming out of the U.S. are multinational, rather than simply American creations. These people stay creative Europeans, even when working in the States.


&gt;I'm sick of riling people up though, I really don't mean this post to be hostile or come off too unhinged.

Don't worry, I'm not riled up. I just wanted to share my perspective. Yours is confusing to me. And if you didn't want to seem hostile, I think you really should have considered what you're implying. 

I think the very idea that people stop creating out of ""laziness"" is absurd and kind of hostile. What could it be born out of, if not hostility or a feeling of cultural superiority? 

The desire to create is a human one. I don't think any culture on this planet has ever slowed down out of disinterest or collective laziness. Maybe arts are seriously underfunded or even censored in some countries, but even then, I guarantee you, people are making these movies using their cellphone cameras and recording albums in their bedrooms. 

You might not think they're good or interesting or worth it, but that's a whole other matter. I even agree with you that many people in Europe don't pay too much attention to the culture being created around them. And I think it's sad. 

But I guarantee you, every country on this planet has significant cultural output. If you don't see European (or African or South American) culture being created, you're not looking for it. Now with everything being spread online and US media dominating pop culture, its easy to overlook it, even when it's from your own country.

But its actually a great thing to give it a shot and take a look at it. And it's really easy to do.

Listen to some Swedish metal or Dutch EDM, watch some French comedies, some Spanish thrillers.

And recommend ""In the Fade"" to your German acquaintances. If they care for movies, they should've seen it. Actually, they should probably watch all of Fatih Akins movies. He's one of German cinemas all time greatest, even comparable with Werner Herzog and Fritz Lang in my opinion.",,/r/europe/comments/h82ijl/queen_victorias_terrible_humiliation/fuqzcz1/,TroublingCommittee,1592090177

&gt;**Jeremiah St. Juste (23), defender, Mainz**  
&gt;  
&gt;Institutional racism is a big, big problem worldwide, a big problem in the Netherlands as well, and a big problem in America on a different scale. The demonstrations show people can’t take it anymore. Really, it’s enough. It has been enough for 400 years, but I’m glad the movement has been gaining this much momentum and traction. People are fed up, speaking up, going on the streets and demonstrating which is very good. I hope people are not afraid to speak out anymore and continue to do so, even though they’re in the presence of people who are ignorant about the situation, even though they might be alone in this situation. I hope more people will speak out. A lot of people have been doing it already but not enough to solve the whole problem.   
&gt;  
&gt;I’ve been stopped many, many times because I drive a big car and I’m ""not supposed"" to drive in a big car as a black man. It \[racism\] is in schools, it’s everywhere. I feel ashamed to tell people who are not from Holland about the use of blackface ""[Zwarte Piet](https://www.dw.com/en/dutch-pm-deems-black-pete-tradition-racist/a-53700075)"" \[*editorial note: A helper of St. Nicolas traditionally portrayed by a white man in blackface*\] in the country. When you talk about this subject, people go on the defensive, they feel offended right away. It’s not black against white. It's everybody against racists. That's how it’s supposed to be. A lot of people are ignorant. They don't really know much about the situation. They can't feel what people of color feel, I understand that, but they can educate themselves. This is so important. I’ve heard a lot of people already changed their mind about the subject and about ""Zwarte Piet.""  
&gt;  
&gt;It is a big mistake to say, ""I don’t see color"" because I have color and people with black skin have black skin and you should see them as somebody who has black skin because if you don't see color, you don't see the person for who they are.

(Speaking only from memory) the first was a terror attack by a single man in Trollhättan who went to a school and stabbed multiple children, police were called to the scene and he was quickly shot.

The second was a much more controversial case, police had been called to an area where an armed man was reported, eventually they found someone matching this description and acting strangely, the police tried to talk to him but instead he pointed his gun at them and was also shot. Only afterwards did the police find out it was a replica gun and the man acted strange not because of drugs or alcohol but because of a severe mental disorder.

3281,"Quoting the FT

Poland’s president Andrzej Duda claimed on Saturday that “LGBT ideology” was “more destructive” than communism, as the central European country heads towards a bitterly contested presidential election. 

Speaking at a campaign event in Brzeg, a small town in the south-west of the strongly Catholic country, Mr Duda, who is backed by the conservative-nationalist Law and Justice party, said he agreed with another politician from the ruling camp who said that LGBT “is not people, it’s an ideology”. “The generation of my parents did not fight for forty years to kick the communist ideology out of schools . . . in order for us to now accept that another ideology should arrive, that is even more destructive for people,” Mr Duda said, describing the LGBT rights movement as “neo-Bolshevism”. “We have our tradition. We have our culture that is based on over 1,050 years of history . . . We won’t allow [Poland] to be taken away from us. We won’t let any ideology, neither communist, nor socialist, nor any other take it away from us, because this is our identity. And let no one try to lead our children on the wrong path, because we won’t allow it.”

 Mr Duda’s comments come two weeks before the first round of what is likely to be a close race between him and the liberal mayor of Warsaw, Rafal Trzaskowski, who has been supportive of LGBT rights and emerged from a field of 10 candidates to become Mr Duda’s nearest challenger.

Poland does not legally recognise same-sex partnerships, but in recent years attitudes towards LGBT rights have begun to shift. One poll last year found that 56 per cent of respondents were in favour of civil partnerships, and 41 per cent backed same-sex marriages, both record highs. However, especially in smaller towns and rural areas, more conservative values still hold sway. And just as it did before the European and Polish parliamentary elections last year, Law and Justice has sought to use the LGBT rights movement — which it portrays as a product of foreign values inimical to Polish traditions — to rally its conservative base ahead of the June 28 presidential poll. 

Earlier this week, Mr Duda signed a declaration in which he pledged to “protect children against LGBT ideology” and ban the “propagation of LGBT ideology in public institutions”. His allies have gone further. Joachim Brudzinski, the Law and Justice MEP who is head of Mr Duda’s campaign, tweeted earlier this week that Poland was “most beautiful without LGBT” while another Law and Justice MP, Tomasz Rzymkowski, last week tweeted a cartoon comparing same-sex marriages to a marriage between a man and a goat.

 Mr Duda’s comments drew criticism from opposition politicians. Robert Biedron, a rival presidential candidate and Poland’s first openly gay politician, called on Mr Duda to “finish with this hate”. Agnieszka Dziemianowicz-Bąk, from the leftwing grouping Lewica, urged the LGBT community to ignore Mr Duda’s words. “LGBT are people. What the government is doing is inhuman,” she tweeted. Donald Tusk, Poland’s centrist former prime minister, also criticised Mr Duda, tweeting that “The President of the Republic should take care of its reputation. Andrzej Duda is doing everything to ruin it. His campaign is an embarrassment in front of the whole world.” Mr Duda hit back, calling Mr Tusk a “coward” for not running against him, to which Mr Tusk replied that he had been interested in running against Mr Duda’s “superior” — a reference to Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the founder of Law and Justice widely regarded as Poland’s most powerful politician",Wales,/r/europe/comments/h86glr/polish_president_says_in_his_campaign_speech_that/fuq8zlg/,gorgeousredhead,1592075678

3332,"I have never said that ""the office of President holds no power in Poland"". President is important office in Poland but that doesn't make Poland semi-presidential republic. President has those powers to counterbalance the powers of the legislative authority, in particular the Sejm. But despite this, Sejm remains the most powerful institution in Poland.

&gt; Our President matters much more than in, say, Germany - where he’s a complete rando.

Yeah, but legal position of Czech President is almost the same as Polish President and yet, on this map Czech Republic is marked as parliamentary republic and not semi-presidential republic.

&gt; Just because Duda is a puppet of Kaczynski doesn’t mean the office of President holds no power in Poland.

Also I don't really like this argument. Why would the president argue with a government belonging to the same political party? The only case that occurred in the history of Polish parliamentarianism was the tensions between Kwaśniewski and Miller, and this occurred during President Kwasniewski's second term when, one could say, he no longer needed a party.

I don't like to use argumentum ab auctoritate but in this case I think it is useful. In ""Polish Constitutional Law"" by Leszek Garlicki you can read that ""The Constitution of 2 April 1997 maintained a parliamentary system of government in Poland, which corresponds to both the tradition of the Constitution of 1921 and the practice of public affairs after 1989.""",Poland,/r/europe/comments/h86x9i/systems_of_government_in_the_eu_select_countries/fupueaz/,LackOfFunNicks,1592067951

The British establishment didn’t give enough of fuck about Irish lives to modify their economic plans, and that lead to mass-starvation and disease causing the deaths of over a million people. That is distinct from an active, purposeful attempt to wipe the Irish out.

I’m going to assume you won’t be convinced by this, but facts are facts, and the academic community is relatively settled on this issue. I do not agree with using the term genocide outside of it’s actual legal definition because the distinction matters, and frankly, whether or not the actions of the British government constitute genocide or not doesn’t change how bad it was.

Because we were in a state of limbo between the East and the West, the US and USSR both readily sent us money and resources. But with the cold war calming down at around the time of Tito's death, the influx money started to slow down and the economy started to be troubled. Even if Tito hadn't died the economy would have sooner or later crashed. The result of that would have probably been unrest and so on.

3710," Queen Victoria was completely attached to her first Prime Minister, Lord Melbourne. So much so that sometimes she was called Mrs. M, as in Mrs. Melbourne. In 1839, two years into her reign, Lord Melbourne's government fell and Robert Peel formed a new one. Melbourne was a Whig, and Peel a Conservative. Now, Peel ran into a huge wall when he asked the Queen to change up some of her ladies in waiting, who were all Whigs, most of them being in some way related to prominent Whigs. Victoria had been forced to ask Peel to form a government, but she refused to get rid of any of her ladies. Even when Peel tried to compromise and asked her to only change a few of the most prominent and important, the Queen refused. In the end, Peel saw this as such a stumbling block that he could not become Prime Minister. To the Queen's delight, Lord Melbourne was able to return. Effectively, Queen Victoria became the last British Monarch to block a Prime Minister from assuming office. This is a level of power that the current Queen couldn't even hope to wield.

&gt; That is the ignorance you carry and not me changing the topic because  topic is ""corruption"" and you call corruption specificly on this  goverment which is true but also missleading from knowing the truth  about Slovenan politics and all im pointing out is they are no different  from the other goverment with corruption yet it bothers people now?  What about 5 years ago? That does not make sanse, why would corruption  be an issue now while everyone knew they steal in every goverment It was  even spoken on media many times how money (we talk in millions)  disappers for different projects they did in the past. If you trully  care about Slovenia and where you live then you would be protesting also  before otherwise its just some two faced game and thats what majority  sees now. 

And here you are doing it again. I said protests are also about corruption. You don't counter that point at all by proving they are, in fact not corrupt at all, you are merely saying ""others are corrupt as well"".

Basically you are trying to shift the topic from ""this government is corrupt and people are protesting that"" to ""others are corrupt as well so this is clearly not about corruption"" and try to shift talk into explaining actions of previous governments so the point that this one is corrupt is forgotten.

And this financing is one of the reasons why this machinery is heaping praise on Orban, that is obvious. The question is whether it was done legally or not, and that is still under investigation. And SDS showed great interest in this investigation even when they were in opposition and have now replaced police leadership and placed their own people there. Coincidence?

Looking at the different industries, the one with the largest decline in production in March and April 2020 was motor vehicles (-33.5 % in March and -68.5 in April compared with the previous months), followed by manufacturing of leather products (-40.4% and -60.2%) and wearing apparel (-32.8% and -30.4%).

Pharmaceutical products had an increase of 16.9% in March, which turned to a decrease of -11.9% in April.

In March compared with February 2020 the largest decreases were recorded in Italy (-28.4%), Slovakia (-20.3%) and Luxembourg (-19.8%). In March, industrial production still increased in four Member States, in Ireland (15.3%), Finland (2.2%), Greece (1.9%) and Lithuania (1.7%).

Corruption, economic collapse and and output comparable to the 1970s output, alcoholism, collapse of morals, values, no stability anymore, brain-drain. Basically very very bad stuff.

It's worth noting that once she began being pressured about the post on their IG, she suddenly said she hadn't posted it. However, she said she supported the rules and also repeated them at the protests. She essentially is BLM Denmark and seems to have near-complete control, being the founder, spokesperson and apparently self-appointed leader. There's an unsettling video from one of the protests where three black women asks her how a decission on not allowing a young man to speak was reached. She avoids answering, but then randomly accuses the three black women of not supporting the cause and begins talking about wanting to die(!). According to her she was contacted in 2016 by the original BLM-USA that asked her to start a chapter in Denmark, but nobody has been able to verify that claim and BLM-Denmark isn't listed as a chapter on the original organization's page. All very strange.

In the start the Danish protests seemed to have lots of momentum and good media coverage, but in just two days she managed to turn it around.

4017,"Calling out a demographic for having a majority opinion is not anything like ‘lumping people in a basket’. Majority opinion = something believed by at least 50%. Not 100%. You risk diminishing how widespread Greek racism is (towards Turks especially) by calling that dialogue ‘ageist’.

Racism and age are very obviously correlated. It’s because as we age, the world moves on and we get left behind. Generations commonly share a majority opinion about something. Eg. In 1958, only 4% of Americans approved of interracial marriage. That’s just the truth. You can call out a generational belief and label that racist without saying the whole generation explicitly is racist.

I’m a big advocate for making allies but I’m not looking for any in old people because our brains literally shrink with age and our fear of death (according to many psychological studies) makes us cling to the society we knew. That further entrenches your existing beliefs and makes learning new things or unlearning literally impossible.

What are your opinions on the concept of a ‘racist country’? Does such a thing exist since you can’t lump everyone in a basket?

4180,"No, it was posted on the story of their official IG before to Danish protests. It had presumably been taken from a site dealing with US protests, but I have no idea who made it first. It was widely covered by Danish media because it really was peculiar in a Danish context. All three things posted further up in this thread were there and when asked by the media she confirmed it.

1) White people should form a chain to protect black people from police.
2) Don't talk to the press if you're white, full stop, or at most just say you're there in solidarity. No mention of speaking on behalf of blm, in which case it would've made sense (obviously, random protester shouldn't pretend to speak on behalf of blm).
3) The restrictions on chants were there, both I can't breathe and Hands up, don't shoot. This rule was also repeated by her on loudspeaker at the Copenhagen protest. The argument presented was that being killed by police is something that happens to a greater extent to black people, i.e. it is their experience. However, that's not the case in Denmark, meaning that this restriction on chants would prevent everybody in the country from making it, regardless of skin color. Similarly, the experience of a black person in Rwanda, whether during the genocide or today, is not the experience of an African American (unless that person happen to originate from Rwanda). US guidelines may be reasonable in the US, but for them to fit everywhere else one has to assume everwhere else is like the US. 

At the protest she also insisted that blacks and whites should stand/walk in separate parts of the protest, and that any chants/singing only could be started by black people. Restrictions/rules that are based solely on the color of your skin is... well, there's a word for that. Rather tragicomical at an anti-racist protest where one of the main strengths is that people of all colors turn up in support.

It is revealing that she ended up attacking Amnesty (also disregarding one of its leaders because of his skin color, but he's half white, half immigrant [evidently not enough for her], and has a long history of fighting for civil rights), even alienated politicians from Enhedslisten (a party that is far-left to an extent virtually unheard of in the US; in comparison Sanders &amp; Ilhan Omar would only be slightly left of center) and started a fundraising without seeking permission (it's easy to get, but they do verify that the fundraising is real and that the money really go to the promissed cause), while a number of people of immigrant origin ended up distancing themselves from her.

4255,"A reddit thread no matter how well moderated is not peer reviewed. Here’s a piece (http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/29258/) that calls the famine a genocide in its abstract. There are other people who say it isn’t, and you can read their arguments, but it depends on what you consider ‘deliberate’ killing. So the trolly problem comes into play.

If you think not pulling the switch to save the person means you’re responsible for their death, then you agree this is a genocide. It is a deliberate killing of a people based on their race (regards Trevelyan’s anti Irishness). Even if the UK did not set the course for the death, the death is their fault and would not have happened if all of Ireland was made up of Anglo-Irish instead of a mix of Anglo-Irish and Catholic, because Trevelyan specifically mentioned that his harsh decisions were made due to the fact this was Ireland, and furthermore the high exportation of food and landlordism that exacerbated the circumstances were traits of British rule.

Kind of a joke you’re calling me karma whoring since all I’m barely ever on reddit and really just use it to read story posts and check the Manchester subreddit lmao. Kind of reminds me of the “looks like a Bot!” argument on twitter when you don’t agree with someone.

4271,"&gt;The most controversial issue in Anglo-Irish affairs is the allegation that food was exported during the Famine. This was first claimed by Irish nationalists as a reason to end British rule and the Famine certainly put an end to the idea that Ireland would be a part of the United Kingdom for good. However, it is extraordinarily difficult to prove the claim true or false, and to my knowledge no one has. Records of exports simply weren’t kept or have since been lost. It is certainly true that some food was exported, but there is no way of knowing how much or if it would have prevented the Famine. Food was also imported. The starving Irish had little money so merchants naturally (in their mind) sold it abroad where they could get a better price.

This year there is a good crop of rice, but we are faced with an acute shortage of wheat, aggravated by unprecedented storms….By cutting down military shipments and other means, I have been able to arrange for 350,000 tons of wheat to be shipped to India from Australia during the first nine months of 1944. This is the shortest haul. I cannot see how to do more.

&gt;I have had much hesitation in asking you to add to the great assistance you are giving us with shipping but a satisfactory situation in India is of such vital importance to the success of our joint plans against the Japanese that I am impelled to ask you to consider a special allocation of ships to carry wheat to India from Australia….We have the wheat (in Australia) but we lack the ships.

So some of those English families did assimilate, just as Irish families did.

4391,"&gt;Races  
&gt;  
&gt; are not a thing, not racism.

False diochomy. One cannot exist with the other one. If race isn't a thing, then racism isn't because it's touching upon a terminology and thing that doesn't exist after all. Xenophobia is then used, for any discrimination against any ethnicity. I'm following up the polish terminology here + adding that ""race"" is not a thing.

&gt; Racism is discrimination based on a perception that another group of people is some hostile ""race"", and because races don't exist, it can be applied to any group, like Eastern Europeans, Jews, Muslims, Roma. 

That's xenophobia.

&gt; It doesn't matter what is the exact type of the persecuted group, as long as they are perceived as a ""race"" by racists. 

Racists perceive anyone that is slightly different physically (to only certain places, like facial shape, skin colour, hair etc) to be a race.

&gt; These overlap. Do not pretend like prejudice in Poland is directed at just general ""others"" when Poles clearly behave differently towards white foreigners and brown foreigners. 

Yes, in Poland is is taught that this is the case of racism and not xenophobia, even though xenophobia is also a correct term here.","Eurosocialist / DemSoc (Podlaskie, Poland)",/r/europe/comments/h7f3gz/george_floyd_protests_across_europe/fun1vjw/,Mifil_,1591996413

Alexis Ohanian didn't get his job because of professional qualities, he gave it to himself based on him being himself. And any white applicant wouldn't be hired for their professional qualities either, but for their connections to the group of people that make up the boards of reddit and Y-Combinator. I'm sorry, did you think board seats are awarded to people that deserve them? You don't live in a meritocracy, the majority of board seats are inherited by family members. Racial quotas are actually a great way of breaking down those powerful webs of connections to allow someone with actual talent to get the job. 

So there it is: racial quotas bring the world nearer to where you think it is because a diversity hire actually needs to prove themselves against every other potential diversity hire and they actually have to deliver results to keep their job. Case in point, Ellen Pao. Definitely more capable of running the site than Huffman or Ohanian, yet got booed out as nothing but a diversity hire. 

&gt;since the Turks are of the same race as the Germans. They are all Caucasians.

Dude... Race doesn't exist. We're all one human race and that's not my opinion, it's *genetics.* If you want to use eugenics to make your people stronger, you'd need to interbreed to gain those traits, not murder everyone until you're left with a super small genepool of ""pure whites"" that reproduce the same genetic defects over and over again. 

In essence: you're right the media does successfully dictate what racism means. And yet they still have a way better understanding of it than you. You haven't ""peeked beyond the curtain,"" you're sitting in Plato's cave, looking at shadows. Stopping ""reverse racism"" doesn't help white people because quotas are used in places where regular white people don't have access to anyway. White guy with money and family connections, white guy with genuine talent, who gets hired to the board of directors? The white guy with money and family connections. White guy with money and family connections, black guy with genuine talent, who gets hired to the board of directors? Not the white guy with talent. See how the result for him always stays the same with and without affirmative action?

Gypsy culture is very isolationist, they actively encourage their separation from the mainstream culture of the countries they reside in, they even have a term for people who are not gypsy, ''gagiu''. They have a whole system of karma basically called ''bacht'' and you have more ''bacht'' by respecting the gypsy traditions, which is often at odds with the culture of the country they are in. For example, at gypsy burials they usually sing and dance, while in Romanian culture, that is very disrespectful. In gypsy communities that organize themselves in their traditional way, a ''satra'', they have their own elders tribunal called a ''stabor'' that judges based on their laws.

4589,"Igor wasn't black, you see. 

But nobody cares about Floyd either. Not even in the US. At the top it's an excuse for political power grabs, at the bottom it's a good excuse for a riot after sitting in lockdown for two months. And that is all it is. Over here most people are just joining in because it's cool, American, and due to the corona stuff one of the only available social events (and, of course, the left wing gets to make political pushes). At least they didn't riot. 

At least in the Netherlands, protests like these (there are loads more every time - they protested Trump's election too, etc.) are also basically networking events.

If you're young, from a left-wing nest, and hoping to make a political career, these protests are where you start. When you go off to university, you join the protests. You make your first connections there, get to know the organizers, then join a bunch of committees and the youth wing for a left party (most likely GL). From there you make more connections, join the real party, climb its ranks, and maybe you'll be mayor of a city some day. More likely you'll end up halfway up in a tax-funded NGO, but then you'll still have a dead easy job for quite a bit of money and where you won't get fired for anything.

You can just join a party you support - and people do, though not in very large numbers - but you won't climb its ranks that way, or get the cushy jobs like e.g. vice director of an art museum. The people who started young at the protests will outmaneuver you at every turn. This is also why it's important to come from a left-wing nest, as your parents will show you how it works in the beginning.

For the right-wing it is similar, but different, and doesn't involve protests. Their cursus honorum is as follows: start out from a right-wing nest (again, not strictly necessary but it will really help), then when you go to university, join a ""corps"". (Like a fraternity, but an old-timey and expensive one for rich people.) Since you're a right-winger, you're probably studying something technical or business/economy, so you can meet people there too. With those connections you then join the youth wing for a right party (most likely VVD). From there on out it's similar to what the left wing does, except you don't end up in a well-paid nothing job at an NGO, but in a a well-paid nothing job in a large corporation. 

This is also why it's almost always left-wing protests. The right wing doesn't use protests in the same way. 

You get the occasional 'real' protest (where people are actually angry about something our government did or didn't do to them), they then often get called ""right-wing"" protests because they're not the left-wing protests, but they are not the same thing.",The Netherlands,/r/europe/comments/h7f3gz/george_floyd_protests_across_europe/fum85la/,marinuso,1591981848

4690,"&gt; You gave no example of why everyone is racist though.

Pretty much everyone has stereotypes in their heads about different groups of people. We can't really help it, stereotypes are an efficient way for our brains to categorize things. 

When you see someone who looks different, your lizard brain sounds the alarm, it's an evolutionary defense mechanism, because back when we were hunter-gatherers there were probably a lot of good reasons to stay the fuck away from different people. They were competing for very limited resources, so they could've been dangerous. They could have spread diseases you weren't immune to, because we were less intermingled. etc

So the most racist and the most xenophobic people were the ones who survived best because it was simply a good strategy to be that way. 

Countless experiments have been done and it seems people, even really young children who couldn't possibly have learned racism, tend to choose to self-segregate, subconsciously. 

Now, if you live in an ethnically diverse society, this can be a problem. If you grow up segregated all of your experiences with other ethnicities will be based on stereotypes, the minority of actual racists will be the one in charge of the conversation.  You might not think like them, but your lizard brain does. 

So what's needed is for people to be cognizant of this and actively work not to treat people based on stereotypes, and if possible to try to have actual experiences with real people from those groups, rather than stay solely in ther in-group.",Romania,/r/europe/comments/h7f3gz/george_floyd_protests_across_europe/fulrbyp/,Relnor,1591974629

These laws would not be so ridiculous if people really cared about data protection. 

The reality is that when a complete technological illiterate can understand, they get angry. Otherwise they're no different from anywhere else.

What are you basing your opinion on?

&gt; I think this issue has a much different nature in Europe than in the US, and these protests will achieve absolutely nothing except vandalism and more coronavirus infections.

Again, people protesting in Europe are not saying that it is the same situation as the US. All countries will experience it differently due to historical, cultural and policy differences. People are not saying 'Our systemic racism is the same as the US!', they are saying 'We also experience systemic racism'.

&gt; We have barely forgotten about the refugee crisis, which led to a rapid rise in radical right wing parties in the EU, as well as radicalize entire countries such as Hungary or Poland.

The refugee crisis has fallen off the front pages because that is how media works. It sounds like you are savvy enough with how media works, so it shouldn't be a surprise to you. Does that mean the refugee crisis has gone away? No. It is the same with systemic racism.

&gt;Climate change will force us to put our money where our mouths are. Then all of today's protesters will be forced to face reality, which is not as simple as these protests make it out to be.

&gt;1. It is **not necessary to use only the most deadly gasses.** 

This is our sentence.

&gt;2. It is **necessary to use not only the most deadly gasses.** 

This is not our sentence.

The main difference between the two is what the 'not' is associated with. In sentence 2, 'not' is associated with 'only', which in turn is associated with 'the most deadly gasses'. Because of this, different conclusions can be made from this statement:

1. The use of gas is necessary.
2. The use of the most deadly gasses is necessary.
3. In addition to the above, the use of non-most-deadly gasses, is necessary.

In sentence 1, however, 'not' is associated with 'necessary' and this allows our sentence to be interpreted differently:

1. The use of gas is not necessary.
2. The use of only the most deadly gasses is not necessary.

Combining this with the rest of the paragraph, it can be interpreted as:

'The use of the most deadly gas is not necessary, since you can achieve the same results, when it comes to defeating your enemy, using non-lethal gasses instead.'

* He is known for his love of fast (and expensive) cars and used to be nicknamed *Prins Plankgas* or Prince full gas. He was fined for speeding multiple times and even had his driver's license suspended in 1987. Also of note is his love for very expensive watches.
* It's been rumoured multiple times he had an affair with a former Miss Belgium and gifted her a Mercedes worth around 500.000 euros (in today's money) in 2000.
* There were suspicions that he tried to sell the photos of his newborn twins for 15.000 euros to a gossip magazine in 2006.
* He has founded many foundations for various purposes and always paid himself and his family members very generously (less of a scandal, but it reinforces the fact that he profits from his royal status without doing too much actual work). One example is his expenses covered by one of his foundations included 10.000 euros for gas.
* Many instances of him meeting with diplomats of various countries without the consent of Belgian Parliament (every action of royal family member with other countries has to be approved by Parliament, so they don't seek out their own foreign policy strategy). Oftentimes, with ministers or diplomats from questionable regimes.
* He was the first member of the Royal family to be called as a witness in a fraud case in 2006/7, the *Marineschandaal.* Though he was never a suspect, it showed a picture of his character and who he interacted with.
* Recently, in 2017, he met with Chinese diplomats in Brussels and even posed for a picture with these Chinese diplomats in his official Belgian marines uniform. He posted the picture on Twitter himself, seemingly unaware of the controversy it would cause. He was fined 15% of his royal pay, some 45.000 euros, but he plans to go to the European Court of Human Rights to fight this.

It's weirder actually.

Nobody ever mentions the first 5-year plan ""at all costs"" when talking about this. Nobody ever mentions the wider 1932-33 famine. Nobody ever mentions a the political and economic background of the events that preceded and followed... That's why there's no historic consensus of it being an actual proper genocide.

4888,"That's simply not true. There are some that are ""opportunity seeking migrants,"" but that's why permanent refugee status is a long time coming (my Syrian friend had to wait two years for his here in Switzerland). In the meantime, they're given a temporary refugee status that's actually quite shit (he lived in a dorm with other refugees in the middle of nowhere and wasn't allowed to work to earn income) and they are questioned several times, sometimes more than a year apart, in order to make sure their story is true. If the relevant institution finds anything wrong in the application, they are forcibly sent back to their country. Even after that, it doesn't give you the same rights and opportunities as other residency permits.

The main reason why refugees try their best to get to countries like Sweden (or Switzerland, for the matter) is that in the countries that are more easily accessible they have to live in overcrowded camps where there is an almost zero chance of your status as a refugee being processed in the foreseeable future. That means you can't earn any income or even leave the quite small perimeter in which you live.

The main problem is that the countries closer to Syria (to keep this example) are overburdened, often poorer that Western countries, and/or do not have the will to do anything about them.

When you look at the numbers, you can tell that Europe isn't taking that many refugees in. The top countries are Germany (with 0.8 million) and Sweden (0.1 million).

&amp;#x200B;

Though there are no documentation that the famine (which took place in other parts in Russia as well, also about half of Ukraine territory was only slihtly affected by it) was PLANNED and there were intentions to kill people in Ukraine.

  
The famine in 1932-1933 took place all over the USSR and death toll was even higher in districts where no Ukrainians were present.

If you check this map -   [https://ic.pics.livejournal.com/burckina\_faso/26952019/191194/191194\_original.png](https://ic.pics.livejournal.com/burckina_faso/26952019/191194/191194_original.png)  (the death tolls in rural area of various USSR districts. Ukraine is marked as 4а, 4б, 4в...4ж; 5 is Crimea. Numbers are promilles (1/1000), (e.g. death toll in Crimea was 12.1 of 1000 people)). You can see that the death toll in districts 6 (Caucasus), 7б and 8б (central Russia) is similar to the Ukraine districts.

Also, if you check similar map of death toll among urban population ([https://ic.pics.livejournal.com/burckina\_faso/26952019/191409/191409\_original.png](https://ic.pics.livejournal.com/burckina_faso/26952019/191409/191409_original.png)), Ukraine has no leading positions as well.

So, no genocide is seen. Famine is seen, which, again was not planned and there were no intentions to kill the specific group of people (differently from Nazis during WW2).

And given that the ICC is more reliable (in terms of resources, independent, unbiased and competent judges, etc.) than Afghan courts, it should only add to the legitimacy of the deference.

Our teacher told us about the crimes of the Stalin era, but now I'm fairly sure that she did it on her own volition.

Anyway, I doubt that many students would retain this knowledge nowadays.

5223,"Truth to be told, administrative city boundaries are not a perfect way of comparing cities. For historical reasons, Paris city limits roughly correspond to zone 1 (out of 5 zones) of the public transport network. 

Sizewise this would be roughly equivalent if Berlin's city boundaries were located at the S-Bahn ring (zone A).

For comparing city sizes it makes more sense to compare the population of the entire agglomeration, i.e. the connected area with buildings. In this way you are independent of historic administrative boundaries and get a feel for the size. That said, some cities in the US or Australia are so much spread out that counting the entire agglomeration sort of overestimates the city size because the population of the agglomeration would suggest a much stronger urban atmosphere than what you really get. An example in Europe for this setting would be the Rhine-Ruhr area in Germany.

&gt; But the USSR had already started the heavy industry in early 30s   all their war infrastructure like factories and supplies had been moved inside the country where they couldn't reach.  

Not enough quantity or quality, which is why they desperately needed the American aid.  They had to move them to the mountains because the Nazis were advancing so quickly. And how do you think having to quickly move all your industry east effects supply? It disrupts it leading to shortages. I repeat, they lacked the resources and industrial capacity.

&gt; as well as securing the collectivization of agriculture 

Didn't to much good when millions were starving in  famines. I repeat, the soviet union lacked the resource and food. 

&gt; And I don't downplay the late but very welcomed US aid. It was  incredibly useful. But yeah, the USSR would not have lost even without  it. 

Except that is exactly what you are doing, downplaying the aid

  [Nikita Khrushchev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikita_Khrushchev) 

&gt; I  would like to express my candid opinion about Stalin’s views on whether  the Red Army and the Soviet Union could have coped with Nazi Germany  and survived the war without aid from the United States and Britain.  First, I would like to tell about some remarks Stalin made and repeated  several times when we were “discussing freely” among ourselves. **He  stated bluntly that if the United States had not helped us, we would not  have won the war. If we had had to fight Nazi Germany one on one, we  could not have stood up against Germany’s pressure, and we would have  lost the war.** No one ever discussed this subject officially, and I don’t  think Stalin left any written evidence of his opinion, but I will state  here that several times in conversations with me he noted that these  were the actual circumstances. He never made a special point of holding a  conversation on the subject, but when we were engaged in some kind of  relaxed conversation, going over international questions of the past and  present, and when we would return to the subject of the path we had  traveled during the war, that is what he said. When I listened to his  remarks, I was fully in agreement with him, and today I am even more so. 

 Marshal G.K. Zhukov  

&gt;In  a confidential interview with the wartime correspondent Konstantin  Simonov, the famous Soviet Marshal G.K. Zhukov is quoted as saying:  
&gt;  
&gt;Today  \[1963\] some say the Allies didn’t really help us… But listen, one  cannot deny that the Americans shipped over to us material without which  we could not have equipped our armies held in reserve or been able to  continue the war.

&amp;#x200B;

 Russian historian [Boris Vadimovich Sokolov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Vadimovich_Sokolov) 

&gt;On  the whole the following conclusion can be drawn: **that without these  Western shipments under Lend-Lease the Soviet Union not only would not  have been able to win the Great Patriotic War,** it would not have been  able even to oppose the German invaders, since it could not itself  produce sufficient quantities of arms and military equipment or adequate  supplies of fuel and ammunition. The Soviet authorities were well aware  of this dependency on Lend-Lease. Thus, Stalin told Harry Hopkins  \[FDR’s emissary to Moscow in July 1941\] that the U.S.S.R. could not  match Germany’s might as an occupier of Europe and its resources.

Wikipedia Lend Lease

Again Zhukov 

&gt; Now they say that the allies never helped us, but it can't be denied  that the Americans gave us so many goods without which we wouldn't have  been able to form our reserves and continue the war,"" Soviet General  Georgy Zhukov said after the end of WWII.  
&gt;  
&gt;""We didn’t have  explosives, gunpowder. We didn’t have anything to charge our rifle  cartridges with. The Americans really saved us with their gunpowder and  explosives. And how much sheet steel they gave us! How could we have  produced our tanks without American steel? But now they make it seem as  if we had an abundance of all that. Without American trucks we wouldn’t  have had anything to pull our artillery with.""

U .S. Ambassador to the USSR William Standley 

&gt; ""It seems that the Russian government wants to hide the fact that it  receives help from outside. Obviously it wants to ensure its people that  the Red Army is fighting this war alone,"" he said during a press  conference in March 1943.

The Soviet Union was the last of many countries to sign a non-aggression pact with Germany (Latvia, Estonia, Poland, Turkey, etc) and tried its best to industrialize and prepare for war.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The Soviet government by diplomacy and other means was striving to delay the Germans until autumn when the approach of winter would postpone any attack until 1942. If Soviet tactics succeeded, then the war with Nazi Germany would come almost inevitably in 1942, but valuable months would have been gained. The period “from now until August” was the most dangerous.  
&gt;  
&gt;This meeting was followed by a series of desperate attempts to appease Hitler. Friendly economic and diplomatic gestures were made. Painful efforts to avoid even the semblance of provocation were continued. On June 14, 1941, TASS, the Soviet news agency, issued a communiqué emphasizing friendly relations with Germany, which was “unswervingly observing the conditions of the Soviet-German Non-aggression Pact, just as the U.S.S.R. is doing” and denying rumors, emanating from London, of an “early war between the two countries.” Berlin ignored these gestures. Hitler had already made his decision.  
&gt;  
&gt;By dawn on June 22, 1941, Timoshenko, Zhukov, and his deputy chief of the general staff, Vatutin, were receiving frantic communications from front commanders. All reported air attacks and requested orders. Timoshenko told Zhukov to telephone Stalin.  
&gt;  
&gt;At 4:30 a.m., all were assembled in Stalin’s office. He stood by the table, his face white, with an unlit pipe in his hand. He was visibly shaken.Molotov hastened into the room from a meeting with the German ambassador. He reported that Germany had declared war.Stalin sank into his chair and sat in silence. This was one of the most shattering moments in his whole life. He had used every means at his disposal to avert this war.

Germany rebuilt its shattered military at four secret bases hidden in Russia. In exchange, the Reichswehr sent men to teach and train the young Soviet officer corps. However, the most important aspect of Soviet-German cooperation was its technological component. Together, the two states built a network of laboratories, workshops, and testing grounds in which they developed what became the major weapons systems of World War II. ————-Without the technical results of this cooperation, Hitler would have been unable to launch his wars of conquest.————-

For example, going to university became a lot more expensive for our own people, due to less subsidies from the government. And since the debt we have is quite managable we've got a really good creditscore. 

Italy, on the other hand, has consitently spent more than they earn. And due to that they have a quite bad creditscore.

Yes, the Khmer Rouge Communists supported mainly by China, invaded Vietnam (which was allied with the Soviet Union against China), and Vietnam decided (wisely) to strike back because they feared all the weapons China was pouring into Cambodia would make them a worse enemy later on. In retaliation China invaded Vietnam (but was thrown out). Which was the third nations in a row Vietnam defeated: France, USA, China.

The USA has acted quite despicable against Cambodia. The last insult was when Obama demanded they repay a loan Nixon had given to the military junta which preceded the Communists - a regime the USA had installed in the first place, for them to be more positive towards US bombings. And at a time when Cambodia is still struggling with things like child nourishment.

It was a Papal grant, which means the whole of Catholic Europe had to recognised it. Which it didn't, which is why I said it was a huge blow to Pope's authority. The next Pope, Clement VII, changed the treaty to open the new discoveries to be claimed by other European kings in 1533 for this reason.

&gt; Citation needed.

“... Out of our own sole largess and certain knowledge and out of the fullness of our apostolic power, by the authority of Almighty God conferred upon us in blessed Peter and of the vicarship of Jesus Christ, which we hold on earth, do by tenor of these presents, should any of said islands have been found by your envoys and captains, **give, grant, and assign to you and your heirs and successors, kings of Castile and Leon, forever, together with all their dominions, cities, camps, places, and villages, and all rights, jurisdictions, and appurtenances, all islands and mainlands found and to be found, discovered and to be discovered towards the west and south,** by drawing and establishing a line from the Arctic pole, namely the north, to the Antarctic pole, namely the south, no matter whether the said mainlands and islands are found and to be found in the direction of India or towards any other quarter, the said line to be distant one hundred leagues towards the west and south from any of the islands commonly known as the Azores and Cape Verde. With this proviso however that none of the islands and mainlands, found and to be found, discovered and to be discovered, beyond that said line towards the west and south, be in the actual possession of any Christian king or prince up to the birthday of our Lord Jesus Christ just past from which the present year one thousand four hundred ninety-three begins. And we make, appoint, and depute you and your said heirs and successors lords of them with full and free power, authority, and jurisdiction of every kind…” —Pope Alexander VI, “Inter Caetera”

All territories found *and* to be found, forever. That's what exclusive means.

&gt; Find me an instance when Portugal or Spain cited the Treaty of Tordesillas in a dispute with a third country.

They didn't, because they didn't have the power to enforce it and nobody recognised it. The Pope already looked ridicule with this grant nobody respected, an humiliating war would have mades things worse. Which is why as I already said, Pope Clement VII changed the treaty in 1533.

&gt; Or better yet, find me an example of a legal contract between two parties ruling a third party that's not under the other two

Find me an equivalent of someone with the authority of the Pope who granted stuff that haven't even been discovered outside of anyone's known territory.

&amp;#x200B;

**Germany**

In Germany before he was even president there were thousands of people as far as the eye could see just to see him speak. It wasn't an event where he was a guest speaker, it was JUST for him. After his presidency he was welcomed by Merkel infront of another crowd where the vast majority of all signs were positive messages about him like ""We love you Obama"" 

&amp;#x200B;

**Ireland**

He was once again treated like a rock God where they shut an entire town down, everyone had to re-enter through US secret service but the vast majority weren't really upset but rather estatic. They literally lined his routes like he was the Pope. When he went to a city in Ireland, the streets were so packed that they wraped around, people couldnt even see him but wanted to be there for the moment.

&amp;#x200B;

**UK, Queen of England drove Obama** (kinky)

Even the Queen of England was excited to see him again. She drove them back to the palace from Marine One. Not only that but Obama was given the extremely rare opportunity to speak infront of the British government in likely Britians most important building for anyone to speak from (at least thats what they tout when others like the Pope and Nelson Mandela spoke from there)

&amp;#x200B;

**Vietnam** 

I know not European but even there, he was again treated with huge respect and massive crowds everywhere he went. He was literally on every news channel, even his car got front page news from state ran newspapers. 

&amp;#x200B;

Clinton was treated well, Bush pre-9/11 and even after 9/11 was mostly treated well.. yeah people act like Trump is all of America and all US presidents - ever.

I really want to hear reverse psychology on this, if Turkey had a tiny rock close to Athens, and called it an island, and claim all the sea around Athens and lock Greek sea within 5-10 kms, what would you guys think?

Admit it, it looks stupid and not fair. Leave being patriotic for a while. The countries should draw their sea portion from their mainland, not from their island and which is more close to Turkey than their own country.

That is why Turks are growing more and more angry every day and Erdogan having huge support. Greeks are outright seeing themselves and their sovereignty superior than Turks, look at this arrogance on the map, it’s not a small African tribe country that you try to lock few kms within its own water, it’s a country with 80 million population, and 10 millions of Greeks are trying to override their country on yours.

5661,"Ethnic cleansing includes population exchanges as well
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_cleansing
&gt;Ethnic cleansing is the systematic forced removal of ethnic, racial and/or religious groups from a given territory by a more powerful ethnic group, often with the intent of making it ethnically homogeneous.[1] The forces which may be applied may be various forms of forced migration (deportation, population transfer), intimidation, as well as genocide and genocidal rape.

In the case of the greeks there was a population exchange and a genocide committed by the Turks. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_genocide
So he was correct when he talked about ethnic cleansing. You can see about the population exchange and how it is considered a form of ethnic cleansing here as well. 
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_transfer. 
Also he was correct when he said that most of the Greeks were driven out and escaped to Greece before the population exchange of 1923 but they were later consindered as part of the population exchange in order to not be able to return to turkey or claim their properties. There were 2.130.000 Greeks in Turkey before the population exchange. 300.000-900.000 were the victims of the genocide and the rest of them are consindered as part of the population exchange even though they were driven out before the population exchange took place. Only 189.916 were exchanged. 
&gt;About 1.5 million Christians and half a million Muslims were moved from one side of the international border to the other.
When the exchange was to take effect (1 May 1923), most of the prewar Orthodox Greek population of Aegean Turkey had already fled and so only the Orthodox Christians of central Anatolia (both Greek and Turkish-speaking), and the Greeks of Pontus were involved, a total of roughly 189,916.[26] The total number of Muslims involved was 354,647.[27]

Also here
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_exchange_between_Greece_and_Turkey
&gt;By the end of 1922, the vast majority of native Asia Minor Greeks had fled the new state of Turkey due to defeat of the Greek army in the Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922).[5]According to some calculations, during the autumn of 1922, around 900,000 Greeks arrived in Greece.[6] According to Fridtjof Nansen, before the final stage, in 1922, of the 900,000 Greek refugees a third were from Eastern Thrace, with the other two thirds being from Asia Minor.[7][8]

As for the muslim  minority of the western Thrace: 
&gt;Under the Treaty of Lausanne, 1923, Greece and Turkey conducted a population exchange: all the Greek Orthodox Christians of Turkey would be resettled in Greece apart from the Greeks of Istanbul (Constantinople), Imbros (Gökçeada) and Tenedos (Bozcaada), and all Turks of Greece would be resettled in Turkey apart from the Muslims of Greek Thrace.[13] 

While Turkey committed these crimes against the Greeks of Constantinople, Imbros and Tenedos

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imbros https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenedos
 to the point that there are only a handful of Greeks there now, Greece honored the treaty and the muslim minority has increased in number
&gt;In 1922, the Muslim minority left in Western Thrace, in Northern Greece, numbered approximately 86,000 people,[4] and consisted of three ethnic groups: Turks (here usually referred to as Western Thrace Turks), Pomaks (Muslim Slavs who speak Bulgarian), and Muslim Roma, each of these groups having its own language and culture. The minority enjoys full equality with the Greek majority, and prohibition against discrimination and freedom of religion are provided for in Article 5 and Article 13 of the Greek constitution.[15] In Thrace today there are 3 muftis, approximately 270 imams and approximately 300 mosques.[16]. 
The Muslim minority of Greece is the only explicitly recognized minority in Greece. It numbered 97,605 (0.91% of the population) according to the 1991 census,[1] and unofficial estimates ranged up to 140,000 people or 1.24% of the total population, according to the United States Department of State.[2]

The first Greeks settled in Anatolia during the 20th century BC and since then Greeks were living continuously in Anatolia until the 20th century AD.  I find it interesting that you consider ""outright crazy"" the ""bitching"" of the greeks but you don't consider outright crazy the fact that you, a turk, is complaining to a Greek about how Greeks ""invaded"" your ""turkish"" lands in 1919 after Turks had already started committing 3 genocides (Armenian, Greek, Assyrian) since 1914. The same ""turkish"" lands where Greeks were living  for thousands of years and the Turks invaded.

Also what you said about provocations in Thessaloniki isn't correct either.
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istanbul_pogrom
&gt;The events were triggered by the false news that the day before, Greeks had bombed the Turkish consulate in Thessaloniki, in northern Greece—the house where Mustafa Kemal Atatürk had been born in 1881.[5] A bomb planted by a Turkish usher at the consulate, who was later arrested and confessed, incited the events. The Turkish press, conveying the news in Turkey, was silent about the arrest and instead insinuated that Greeks had set off the bomb.[6]
The trial revealed that the fuse for the consulate bomb was sent from Turkey to Thessaloniki on 3 September. During the Yassıada Trial it was claimed that a twenty-year-old university student named Oktay Engin was given the mission of installing the explosives, two sticks of gelignite, in the consulate's garden.[25][27][28] The consul M. Ali Balin allegedly first pressured consulate employee Hasan Uçar, but Engin was brought in when Uçar resisted. Both of them were arrested after the attack.[29]",,/r/europe/comments/h0xg3u/countries_with_less_population_than_istanbul/ftq4k80/,Capriama,1591902528

5689,"Yes, out of ethnic differences between Czech and Slovaks and a general apathy between each other.  Moravia and Bohemia are both parts of Czech and both speak the same language and are currently Atheist/historically Hussiite. 
Besides this, Bohemia and Moravia where both parts of the Crown of Bohemia for 500 hundred years, while being a single political entity with Slovakia barely passed the 70 years 


The island of Taiwan and continental China both speak the same language and were historically part of the Ming with Koxinga and of the Qing and of the republic of China who lost the Civil War to the peoples republic, so the claim passed to the winner of the Civil War

The republic of China was a corrupt, unpopular government sponsored by the USA who got what it deserved: lose. 

The only reason they were more developed than Continental China is because of millions of free dollars given by the US and the fact that Chiang Kai Shek stole all the gold and national treasures as he could, besides Taiwan not being affected by the Civil War as much as the mainland, besides Taiwan being more modernized because of Japanese ownership for the last 50 years prior to the lost of WW2. 

There is a lot of hate towards China lately, which is justifiable, I mean, China is becoming the new empire and both the US and the white, democratic liberal world are scared that a country they once exploited is going to take that position of #1. This is why the US and allies have consistently sponsored terrorism in Gansu and Xinjiang just like they did with the Taliban and Al Qaeda in Afghanistan or sponsored an unpopular undesired Dalai Lama to retake his feudal monarchy to enslave the Tibetan people. 

Mao wasn't perfect and neither is the CCP. The 100 flowers campaign, the great leap forward and the cultural revolutions are examples (incredibly overused) of mistakes that have been committed. 

Yet the ending of illiteracy, end of poverty, abolishment of slavery in Tibet, end of Opium addiction, liberation of the woman, the rebuilding of the poorest nation on the world while at the same time being on constant threat to nuclear extinction and on permanent boycott until Richard Nixon... It is very admirable to say the least. 

Compare that to Europe or Japan/South Korea/民国 China/India/Latin America who received billions of free money and protection to rebuild and still couldn't surpass the US

Yes and no. I do understand that frustration; but on the other hand you still get half of everything you can add to your pay even now; and I find it not unreasonable for the strongest shoulders to bear the heaviest burden. We're not the US :-p

I just looked up the brackets, and [https://www.expatica.com/be/finance/taxes/taxes-in-belgium-100073/#rates](https://www.expatica.com/be/finance/taxes/taxes-in-belgium-100073/#rates) puts the high bracket at 50% for this year. I also fall in the high bracket, and I only land at 36-odd percent averaged; to be quite blunt, if your income is at the point where you're actually approaching 50% you earn a multiple of what I do and I can safely assume you're not starving :-)

That being said, though; I do understand the frustration; personally I'm frustrated more by how the money is used than by the fact that I'm contributing over a third of my income. The whole political caste is stagnant and focused more on themselves than the actual running of the place for the benefit of the populace - and, honestly, the parties who proclaim loudest that they're different are in front of the handout queue.

Something really must change; but I'm not convinced it's the tax rates.

- NATO had to bomb Serbia because Bosnian-Serbs supported by Serbia started a civil war when they committed genocide against Bosniaks.

- Because of the genocide the Albanian population in Kosovo didn't feel safe and declared independence to prevent another genocide.

You can call the EU what you want, but the truth of the matter is that FYRs want to join the EU and if the Serb population keeps being so aggressive you will be the last FYR to join the EU.

Yes, the bombing of Bosnian-Serbs was controversial at best and a grave failure in humanity at worst, but it's not like Serbia is the Angel there either.

5939,"&gt;am coming from looking at the world as a calm thoughtful adult mindful of my own biases and trying to learn the facts and not just lash out as a child.

If you're not interested in actually looking into the criminality of what the US has done in the last decades then you're not really trying to learn the facts. If your first response is to call such critique ''childish'' and ''edgy'' it shows that you're the one with absolutely no capacity for thinking outside of your own headspace and biases. But, again, I understand where this unwillingness to critically approach the US comes from - it's deeply uncomfortable to look at our allies through such a lense, especially taking into account where criticism of them is against our national interests.

&gt;You look at uninformed, envious loudmouths, who like the position of sitting on their high horse offering thoughtless criticism sometimes fair, but mostly unfair, denying the complexity of the world choosing to simplify it to some non-existing theoretical complex and think ""how could I be more like these shitstains"".

So if you admit the criticism *has factual basis* and is not just rooted in plain anti-Americanism (which I fundamentally disagree with, as imperialist actions are fundamentally bad whether done by the US, by China, France, Russia etc.), why do you grandstand here pissing on me, calling me childish and acting as if I'm quoting 8chan talking points?

5944," Bullshit. The word ""Slave"" comes from Latin. I think all western countries have this word. From Spain to Sweden how is it possible for all of them to have this word and say its because Slavic people were enslaved ? Did Spain enslave Slavic people? No, they did not, but they have this word. So they just start using it because it was the trend to enslave Slavic people? This explanation was done by Germans I beleave, and they are not big fans historically of Slavic people. 

The word I think was recorded first as ""Eslabo"" and the word for Slavic people in Latin is ""Sclavini""(plural).

What is the word for work/labor in Latin? **LABOR** \--&gt; EX+LABOR-&gt; ESLABO -&gt; (SPANISH ESCLAVO) (FRENCH ESCLAVE) etc.

The important/respected work ""LABOR"" , work that is **not** important/respected EX+LABOR. ""EX"" meaning ""outside"", like EX+HUSBAND , no longer the husband.  If Most catholic countries have this word it must be because of that.

5954,"u/LowEffortPenguin is not saying that. Is talking about using the ""Veto"" not just disagreeing/voting against.

Invoking a Veto, unlike what seems to have become fashionable, should not be used just because you dislike a proposal. It is, politically speaking, the equivalent of a WMD, and it should be treated as such, and in any reasonable (read pre-2010) world it should only be used if the proposal actively threatens the member state. 
So, yes, by this logic, if a member state thinks something is Veto-worthy, if they are honest, they should also consider it as potential cause to invoke clause 50, especially, when faced with a near unanimity for the other side of the issue.

OTH I actually partially agree that the package just not be a “free money” bag. I think that it should be accompanied by the creation of a EU central Budget and Tax Authority with full overriding powers over member states tax policies and budgets, beginning with any net receivers of this “package”, but extending, within 5 years, to all member states. And place this authority not under the control of the European Commission, the Eurogroup nor the ECB, but under full control (and answerable only to) of the European Parliament. 
That would assure that we would not have this problem ever again, and that fiscal idiocy by individual member states is kept in check.

5976,"&gt; It is not that simple, friendly connection of Serbia with China (and with African countries if that matters) is older than EU, and Serbia does get at least some international support from China. Serbians do have positive feelings about Chinese.

Uh.. so what? Aren't there other countries you have long diplomatic relations with? India, Morocco, Argentina, etc.? I'm sure there must be some but that doesn't automatically make you relations better does it? In Bulgaria I've heard the Chinese investment promoters say the same: we have long diplomatic relations, everyday people in China totally know about Bulgaria and like it very much, blah blah. They're just making up stuff to hype their ""investments"". And saying general nice stuff because that's what diplomats do. Google Obama saying country X ""punches above its weight"". Same shit from China but worse.   

&gt;the only difference with China is that China is more transpatent about their expectations.   

China is the last country to be transparent with something. Is it not enough they're pretending to be doing anyone a favour with their investments that are actually loans paid to Chinese companies? People don't seem to realise how great of a business this is for China. Imagine you had a rich friend that loaned you 10k euros. But you had to return them with interest. And you were only allowed to spend the money for buying things in your friend's supermarket. So you friend gets the money back immediately... and then again when you return the loan. And if you didn't repay the sum you friend  got your car as collateral. That's what  China is doing. It's making crazy money from its loans. It's basically a social program for Chinese workers and companies that someone else pays for. China is not the one doing you a favour by investing in you with such  terms, if anything China owes YOU for giving it such nice opportunities. I'm sure Western governments would love to do the  same things as China but let's face it if they tried everyone would criticise it as neocolonialism.    

&gt;Additionally, event if that is all free money it is not even close to amount Serbia lost and is losing on the actions of EU. Like amount of educated people that left.

The rest was all in the Asian side of the war which had pretty much nothing to do with Germany. Not that this makes any of it ok but I just don't like when we use wrong numbers during discussions.

Now what exactly is worth 40 millions deaths? Maybe another 40 million deaths? Perhaps total extraction of resources from the losing side (which the soviet union pretty much did in all of eastern Europe axis country or not)? Maybe enslaving the defeated population for 40 years?

You quickly get to the point where only by committing other atrocities would you have something comparable.
