1,"Actually, Soviet grand strategy was 1) waiting for another imperialist war, 2) waiting for another great depression, and 3) outcompeting the capitalists in the meantime. As it played out they failed on all three accounts, but the reasoning is rather interesting. The lesson Leninism drew from WWI is that imperialist powers will *eventually* always go to war with each other *and* that such wars will likely lead to a communist revolution as it did in Russia. And the lesson the Soviets drew from Marx was that capitalism is inherently unstable and will always lead to big crashes of the economy. And obviously they believed in the superiority of their system so #3 was a no brainer. But as it turned out, the 'imperlialist' powers forgot to have another war with each other. Instead they rather banded together in the face of an external threat, the Soviet Union. They also forgot to crash their economies, always trying to fix the shortcomings of capitalism, learning from the crashes of the past and successfully mitigating economic crises when they do occur.

&gt; 
&gt; # The real lessons from Sweden’s approach to covid-19
&gt; 
&gt; **Sweden is held up as a champion of liberty. In fact it is the home of pragmatism**
&gt; 
&gt; [image](https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/563/90/sites/default/files/20201010_LDP502.jpg)
&gt; 
&gt; *Editor’s note: Some of our covid-19 coverage is free for readers of The Economist Today, our daily newsletter. For more stories and our pandemic tracker, see our hub*
&gt; 
&gt; THE GREAT thing about using a small country to support your argument is that your opponents are unlikely to know what is really going on there. Perhaps that is why Sweden, with 10.3m people, has become a much-cited example in the debate about how to deal with covid-19. Liberty-loving Swedes are supposedly pursuing a mask-free, lockdown-light strategy that will create herd immunity without bankrupting the economy. Sweden’s success, it is said, is a standing rebuke to the left-wing killjoys who love bossing folk around and shutting everything down.
&gt; 
&gt; Sweden does indeed hold lessons—but they are less about freedom than about using trade-offs to generate lasting social cohesion. The country makes an odd paragon for fans of small government. The last time it pursued individualism red in tooth and claw, social policy was in the hairy hands of men who went to work in longboats. Today Sweden is a progressive beacon, lying seventh in the OECD’s ranking of social spending—ahead even of Germany.
&gt; 
&gt; Fans of Sweden are right to point out that, in the first phase of the disease, the government had a light touch. Although it banned large groups and issued plenty of health advice, it rejected blanket lockdowns. But that was not a particularly successful approach. Sweden has a fatality rate of around 60 per 100,000, ten times that of Finland and Norway, which did lock themselves down. Swedes’ freedom did not spare the economy, even though many deaths were among elderly people no longer working. Output in the second quarter alone shrank by 8.3%—also worse than the other Nordic countries. A high caseload is bad for the economy.
&gt; 
&gt; One rejoinder is that, unlike Britain, France and Spain, Sweden has not seen a second wave. However, even if you leave aside the fact that cases in Stockholm County roughly quadrupled in September (in absolute terms, they are still low), Sweden’s new strategy for the second phase converges with Germany’s. Contrary to some claims, this is not dependent on herd immunity—Sweden still has a large population of susceptible people. Rather, it entails rapid large-scale testing and contact-tracing so as to identify and suppress outbreaks early. This is accompanied by a clear, consistent message that is sustainable because it gives people autonomy (see article). Those are the building blocks of successful anti-covid-19 strategies everywhere.
&gt; 
&gt; The lesson from the new Swedish policy is not that it is libertarian, but that the government weighs up the trade-offs of each restriction. For instance, when someone tests positive, their entire household must go into quarantine, but schoolchildren are exempt—because, the government reckons, the gains from shutting them away are overwhelmed by the lasting harm to their education. Likewise, the quarantine lasts five to seven days, compared with two weeks elsewhere. The risk of spreading covid-19 in that second week is small and shrinking, but the harm to mental health of extended isolation is growing.
&gt; 
&gt; Sweden is a high-trust society, where people follow the rules. And yet its approach is based on the idea that, as covid-19 is here for a long time, asking too much of people will lower compliance and thus spread the disease. Low-trust societies may need a different balance between coercion and self-policing but they, too, need sustainable rules.
&gt; 
&gt; And what of masks? Sweden’s fans seize on mask-free crowds in Stockholm as proof of its liberty. But that is not the basis for its policy. Government experts argue that the evidence that masks help is weak, and that their other measures work fine. In this, Sweden is out of step with other countries. If the disease charges back there, that is likely to change. After all, its policy is based on evidence and pragmatism, not blind principle. ■",Sweden,/r/europe/comments/jdxvq4/the_real_lessons_from_swedens_approach_to_covid19/g9b7buz/,Ampersand55,1603103449
19,"now i dont understand - what part should be banned in your opinion ?  
the part of the muslim being proud of his son killing the teacher, or the part of the news that reports it?

both have the potential to incite violence and hatred.

i agree that it really IS hard to always stand up against ""hate speech"" (lets call it that, despite i really, really dont like that term) with rationalism and that sometimes it's sheer impossible - but assuming we say that a liberal democracy (in whatever form) is the optimum form of society, we absolutely need to assume that the people need to be mature and susceptible to reasoning (otherwise it would not be the best society).

That leads to the conclusion that people that are NOT susceptible to reasoning should not be part of the ""voting"" class (lets call it that, i dont have a better word, no native speaker, sorry) and/or the society itself (depending on if they are willing to accept the rules the society has).

That leads to the conclusion that if we live in such a society - and i think we should at least strive to - hate speech can not have a big effect, if the reasonable people do not ""give up"" but always stand up and tell the hate speecher that s/he is wrong.

It's a bit of a paradox, i agree. But it is absolutely necessary for a free society to allow free speeches in EVERY aspect. it is NOT necessary to tolerate every ACTION - but if you think something that is just said or written has such dangerous effects on people, it is not only a bit insulting to those people, i think.

if my idealistic views are not aligning with reality, thats expectable. Does not change a thing that free speech SHOULD be an absolute value with no exceptions.",,/r/europe/comments/jdqmvb/paris_knife_attack_attackers_family_proud_of/g9b7bwk/,merodac,1603103451

22,"Thread was locked so I couldn't reply.

&gt; What you are saying is basically in this context (the job) he is allowed to touch women because it is never sexual

I never said this, stop strawmanning. The reason you can touch a woman as a doctor is because your calling, which is to heal, takes precedence. The same way you are allowed by law to kill someone if that same force is facing you, it's called self-defense, because your life takes precendence over your attackers right to live. The world is not black and white, so stop acting like it is because it helps your weak argument.

&gt; So there can be no way that a handshake can be not sexual in their eyes?

Better safe than sorry? It's not that all contact with women is sexual, it's just that some can be, and that is enough.

&gt; Regardless of culture you do see there is major flawed logic in this right?

The greatest idiot is he who tries to find logic in religion. Faith, religion and deities are all above human logic. Religion can be dogmatic and it still isn't an argument for it being wrong. Religion is neither right nor wrong. It just is, and it's your choice to believe if it's right or wrong. And last time I checked, our european values are all about allowing everyone to decide for themselves.

As other people have noted, there were other things he was likely rejected for. Things that are not compatible with the german constitution. And that's OK.

54,"&gt; You think people in Essex, York or Scotland suffer from and are less aware of the Viking colonization (which has culturally and economically divided them from the rest of Britain ever since) than the Belgian colonization of Congo?

In general they are less aware of its negative consequences.

Try ask regular Portuguese about it. Don't expect many to know.

They are less common. And yes, often they are less valid. Being alienated from part of ancient history (Roman Lusitania is part of Portuguese ancient history) is lesser harm than dealing with instability and poverty as result of something that ended less than century ago.

India has nukes.

China has nukes, and an increasingly strong navy and army, and is likely to become a rival of the US sooner rather than later.

START has expired and it doesn't seem like it'll be renewed.

Trump is not unlikely to withdraw the US from NATO if he wins re-election, which could lead Russia to take risks and miscalculate in Eastern Europe.

Trump allegedly suggested nuking a hurricane to prevent it reaching the US.

I also as a rule don't believe in multicultural states. Especially not ones consisting of antagonistic people. Belgium is a perfect example. One of the most advanced countries in every way in the world but the North and South are fuming about each other and not capable of electing governments. If Belgium can't manage what chance do Greeks and Turks have?

I think ethnic self determination is the best way towards peace. Whether that's for the Kurds in Turkey, Turkish Cypriots in Cyprus, Albanians in Kosovo or Armenians in NK.

This is the one thing I wish could be reformed whether in the Quran or Hadith, whether it matters at all what non-Muslims do. Ofc fundies wouldn't read any editions, but at least it would clearly show the intent of moderates in distancing themselves from radicals so that non-Muslims can see moderates as friends.

And what the hell is up with fatwas and mullahs having power to meddle in politics despite being religious leaders? There is a big problem with the Quran or Hadiths, if they propagate the authority of sharia or extol the virtues of giving the church all power.

Christian theocracies have been based on the idea of imitating or bringing the Kingdom of God, though the clear message the Bible has is to let God do all that in the Rapture and whatnot. I feel either the Quran or Hadiths have some form of ""creating a society that follows Allah's rules"" like the Old Testament does, except there is nothing to supercede that? 

Mixing religion with law is an inherently fundamentalist notion and though some aspects of sharia are just recommendations etc., they really dictate life even for moderate Muslims.

You are mistaking the US imperialism for secularism!
And all those excuses to ""bring democracy"" to countries that just happens to try to change to trade in euro instead of dollars.
I agree with you - this is one of the worst and most dangerous things that happened in the last decades (and is still happening). It lead to a lot of deaths (not millions per se) and a lot of suffering.
and sadly some european countries are also taking part in this, but - politics always is more complicated than that, and sometimes you are forced to do things and smile doing it that you dont want to.
btw - the US itself is definitely NOT secular. A country that has it's leaders vow swear to the bible? That is like in the dark middle ages, but with a pretty paint (and a strong military).

but that all is not secularism. thats the american imperialism.

now that we were able to bring light to this misunderstanding, i hope you can re-think your view of sekularism. Just take my statement about who is responsible for your actions (an imaginary friend or yourself) and try to think for yourself how that extrapolates. i am sure you will get to the same conclusions if your mind is open.

365,"I'm want to discuss, not to argue, in the sense that I'm trying to not make any type of accusations.

If God is a an idea in people's mind, it can't defend itself. And yes, I think that more rigorous ideas based on empirical evidence have defeated less rigorous ideas not based on evidence.

But I'll think about the possibility of God being real and point out the contradictions that I've found:

First of all, there isn't a well-stablished definition of God. So I'll define it as a: ""*Conscious, intelligent entity with extraordinary powers*"".

In the first page of Genesis I, God is described as the creator of planet earth, light (electromagnetic radiation), the firmament (stars and the rest of the universe, I suppose), water (H2O molecules), plants and animals (carbon-based molecular structures), including humans.

But God is also described with human-like features:

In [Exodus 20:1-5](https://skepticsannotatedbible.com/ex/20.html), God is described as being able to speak words and have feelings of jelousy towards other gods. And in [Proverbs 2:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+2%3A6&amp;version=ESV), it says that God has a mouth and from it comes knowledge. There can be more examples, but those are the ones I've looked so far.

The problem I see is that there is a contradiction in the claim that a conscious and intelligent entity is the creator of the universe.

First of all, the only empirical evidence we have about conscious entities are developed animals.

So, what is the structure of developed animals?

They are complex and dynamic structures of eukaryotic cells ([microscopic image of the skin](https://ohiostate.pressbooks.pub/app/uploads/sites/36/h5p/content/10/images/file-598f210dbfe01.jpg)).

And eukaryotic cells are structures of water and carbon-based molecules such as [nucleic acids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA#/media/File:DNA_Structure+Key+Labelled.pn_NoBB.png), [phospholipids](https://www.creative-proteomics.com/images/Phospholipids-Analysis-Service.png), [proteins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Na%2B/K%2B-ATPase#/media/File:3b8e.png), [carbohydrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycogen) and combinations of those. Molecules are structures of bonded atoms. And atoms are structures of the some of the fundamental particles described by the [Standard Model of Physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model#/media/File:Standard_Model_of_Elementary_Particles.svg).

Then, why/how are developed animals conscious beings? These following links offers the current scientific understanding of human consciousness:

[*Consciousness: New Concepts and Neural Networks* by Tong Zhao et al., Front Cell Neurosci. (2019); 13: 302](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6629860/)

[Neural Correlates of Consciousness](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Neural_correlates_of_consciousness#The_Neural_Correlates_of_Consciousness)

[Models of Consciousness](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Models_of_consciousness)

According to the [Integrated Information Theory](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Integrated_information_theory), a conscious entity NEEDS to have a complex structure COMPOSED of interconnected and interdependent elements that can be in more than one state. Like excitated or inhibited state of neurons. That has implications:

* Any conscious entity can't exists without the existance of interconnected components, like neurons, molecules, atoms or the fundamental particles of physics. Therefore, a conscious entity CAN'T BE the creator of the fundamental elements of the universe.
* Any conscious entity must have a dynamic and complex structure, therefore it's structure is unstable and can't be eternal.
* Any conscious structure have a limited processing power and action-producing power determined by the scope of the structure. A conscious entity can't be omniscient or omnipotent.

That huge contradiction is why I think God is just the character of a series of book written by different people [over 11 centuries (8th BCE to 3rd CE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorship_of_the_Bible).",,/r/europe/comments/jdnjej/muhammad_in_the_hell_sant_petronio_church_bologna/g9ap6f9/,FlyingCanary,1603084110

435,"Iraqi Kurdistan is allied with Turkey. Turkish and Peshmarga forces fought together in 2015 against ISIS. When Saddam gassed the region with US-made Chemical weapons, it was Turkey that opened its doors to Iraqi Kurdish refugees. Iraqi Kurdish channels go out of their way to air Turkish soap operas even.

Trust me, the dynamic that's repeated on the press is heavily distorted. It doesn't hurt Erdogan as much as it probably hurts ordinary Kurds by constantly conflating them with the YPG/PKK as if they're all the same. During the Iraq-Iran War when  the separatists attacked Saddam and he bombed them back, that hurt ordinary Kurds. The same dynamic applies to Syria.

How often do you hear ""the Kurds"" and ""Kurdish forces"" like they're a monolith? They are diverse like any other ethnic group. There are secularists, moderate Islamists, as well as Kurdish Jihadist groups like Ansar al-islam and Harakat Salaheddin el-Kurdi.

You would never hear anyone say ""the Arabs"" or ""the Persians"", because people will call you out for the generalizations.

The amount of fake sympathy and fake outrage people on the interwebs display, I would like to see for an actual stateless people like the Rohingya, who are being genocided by Myanmar.

Kurdish people all have Turkish, Iraq, Syrian or Iranian passports. They aren't stateless. Not every large ethnicity has an ethnostate. There is no Tamil or Telugu or Marathi country, no Fulani country, or the dozens of large ethnicities in Indonesia and Philippines or the several in Africa. They share their country with other ethnic groups.

As a neutral outsider, a Kurdish state doesn't bother me anymore than any other state. Whether its a Salahuddin (Kurd) or a Baibars (Turk), it is the same. The political West continues to push deluded narratives until it bites them in the ass.  The first large Kurdish rebellion began because of a Sunni Islamist preacher Sheikh Said against the rightwing Turkish secular dictatorship.",,/r/europe/comments/jau93i/turkish_authorities_have_banned_a_kurdishlanguage/g9admbz/,wholelottagifs,1603075912

630,"  The main reason Islam forbids any kind of portrayal of Muhammad is to decrease the amount of people who may praise him to the level of the God. 
  If we take a look back to the Arab geography before Islam, the main religion on the area consisted many gods and they were represented with statues. People were praying to those statues and had a respect to them like they are the gods and not just statues of them. After Muhammad became a prophet and started spreading Islam, he himself didnt want people to make his paintings or statues. There were still pagan Arabs living and some of the muslims converted to Islam from paganism. According to Islam, Allah is the only god and Muhammad is just a human being with a special job of being Allahs prophet. Muhammad had the fear of people praising him to the level of Allah, which by the way it is one of if not the biggest sin according to Islam, because of their old habits.
  I dont identify myself as a muslim even though i come from a muslim majority country which makes me informed and educated about Islam.

677,"&gt; do you think any set of people is intrinsically more moral than the others?

No. I don't believe in intrinsic morality.

&gt; This is indeed the dispute I am involved in. What dispute are you discussing then?

One between you and me, not one between you and other person. Interpretation of text and logic.

&gt; You are heavily off track here. What I think is factually incorrect is the very first comment (I responded to a comment defending it), claiming that European colonization was the invention of slavery and war.

I know that what you think is factually incorrect is very first comment. I am not off track. You apparently think that I want to discuss morality of colonisation. I don't and that should have been obvious several comments ago if not from start.

&gt; I will ignore the orthographic cynism and the insult.

1) Using wrong word isn't matter of orthography.

2) It wasn't supposed to be insult.

3) Again - you aren't ignoring if you are responding...

&gt; You very clearly mentioned my ""not outright dickish or having a nice style""

No. I clearly stated not being outright dickish or having nice style for example doesn't prevent one from being hostile. There is no ""you"" in that sentence and even if there was, that doesn't mean I am talking about you specifically. General/hypothetical you is pretty common thing.

&gt; as well as my imagined downvoting,

Read it again. Do you see me saying that you specifically are downvoting me? Closest thing is saying that it's possibility.

&gt; Read your own comment again.

You read it again. Carefully. Don't assume and jump to conclusions, work with precisely what I wrote.

&gt; I'm referring to the 2 long comments I posted

OK. Does it really count as disregard if it has nothing to do with my objective? You more and more seem like someone who is offended because I am not paying attention to your work you put so much effort into...

&gt; Again, not discussing something 

They are questions. How about you answer them?

&gt; Then stop insulting me.

I can't stop, because I haven't started. If you interpret my words as insults, which I fully admit can happen, that's on you.

&gt; If you have nothing to say to me, don't.

I have something to say to you, it just happens that it might not include you, which I can't possibly know. Is such concept alien to you?

&gt; You pointed out something trivial in the guise of an attack

You might be surprised how many struggle with something so trivial. Also - guise of attack? What?!

&gt; Yes please continue being childish

I can't continue, because I haven't started. Maybe you should stop saying that you are ignoring something and actually ignore it instead.

690,"I actually studied Islam in a history minor at university. One of the papers on the subject brought up a good point. When asking people exactly what sharia law was... most of them (whether they were for or against it) couldn't really define it and honestly didn't know what it precisely  is. 

Another book in the course (a good one ""Sharia made by a Christian Jurist, sadly in Dutch) went on to describe it as a judicial methodology. There is as much difference between it and Dutch law as between Dutch and US law.

The funny part is that even in the very very unlikely event sharia law came in the changes would be substantially less than people assume. This is because the people making the law may be using another judicial methodology but they are still picking and choosing what to take, how to interpret it etc. They can easily for example leave of anything they dislike.

In short, most people arguing for or against Sharia law don't actually understand what it actually is.They have an image in their head that bares some vague resemblance to the actual thing.

If a positive property *φ* implies a property *ψ* in each possible world, then *ψ* is positive, too (axiom 1).[\[note 3\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_ontological_proof#cite_note-11)  Gödel then argues that each positive property is ""possibly  exemplified"", i.e. applies at least to some object in some world  (theorem 1). Defining an object to be Godlike if it has all positive  properties (definition 1), and requiring that property to be positive  itself (axiom 3),[\[note 4\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_ontological_proof#cite_note-12) Gödel shows that in *some* possible world a Godlike object exists (theorem 2), called ""God"" in the following.[\[note 5\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_ontological_proof#cite_note-13) Gödel proceeds to prove that a Godlike object exists in *every* possible world.

The idea that Macron is just going to come along and usurp the most profoundly held religious beliefs of people through a mixture of pro French quasi-propaganda and mass state surveillance is not compelling to me.

I'm not saying I have a better idea by the way and what he's doing is probably at least the right direction and intent. Frankly my #1 desired policy change would be a massive decrease in migration and acceptance of refugees from problem regions.

786,"&gt; The US does immigration better that’s a fact. Most Muslims immigrants in the US integrate fairly well within a generation at-least compared to Europe 

That's quite simple to explain: the US doesn't have the most uneducated illegal immigrants coming to its soil. Mostly because the US is geographically separated by a whole ocean so crossings are impossible.

Consequently only the most educated, secularised and civilised people from Muslim countries go there. French Muslims of similar level of education and secularism don't cause any problems either. The fringe community of Islamists does though.

&gt; The US has 11 million illegal Mexican immigrants alone lol. 

Let's do some honest and comparable comparisons please. The US has the size of the whole Western Europe in terms of population. Germany alone welcomed more immigrants than the whole US in the recent years despite being 5 times smaller.


&gt; They don’t have beheadings and terrorist attacks on a daily basis like Europe. If current trends continue bad things are horizon for Europe. 

Perhaps because Mexicans aren't Muslims and consequently you won't see any Islamist terrorist attack from them. 

If Europe had the chance to have uneducated Mexicans instead of uneducated MENA/Maghreb migrants, we would definitely be better off and with close to zero terrorist attack.

The belief is that the Azeri soldiers posted the picture on the social network page after the killing. The brother had two consecutive telephone conversations with the Azerbaijani soldiers, during which several Azerbaijani soldiers collectively mocked and tried to humiliate the brother of the killed soldier.

Since you don't actually link to your sources and as I see from the comments of the OP probably they are not very objective, don't educate me here on being biased. Take a look at the mirror.

&gt; According to the former minister of education and science of Lithuania, [Zigmas Zinkevičius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zigmas_Zinkevi%C4%8Dius), Lithuanian Poles are Polonized Lithuanians who ""are incapable of understanding where they truly belong"" and it is ""every dedicated Lithuanian's duty"" to re-Lithuanize them. Lithuanization promoted the cooperation of Polish and Russian minorities, who support the [Electoral Action of Poles in Lithuania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_Action_of_Poles_in_Lithuania). 

WTF? The guy is dead, this was said maybe 20 years ago. 

&gt; [Lithuanians are increasing number of Lithuanian language lessons in minority schools, disproportionally minisculing minority language lessons.](https://www.icelds.org/2018/09/03/increasing-hours-for-the-lithuanian-language-in-minority-schools-why-and-how/) 

This was never accepted and there are explanations that this breaks the EU law we agreed to. 

&gt; If I were Lithuanized, I'd have behaved no differently. 

No Polish people are, were or will be Lithuanised. Whoever tries to prove otherwise are just creating unnecessary conflict. As I mentioned the party in question - Tomaszewski's party - has done absolutely nothing to represent Polish or Russian people in the parliament, but living from the constant conflict as it elects them to government. If they would actually care about minorities - most of the problems wouldn't exist nowadays because majority of Lithuanians are happy to have minorities and help them when necessary.

And the husbands are responsible for serving their wives and their households. And the mother has a higher position and authority than the father.

Anyone who is bleeding is considered impure. If you are bleeding from a wound for example. Periods also are NOT just blood, but tissues as well.

&gt;1. I neither wrote nor implied that.
2. It isn't argument opposing mine. It is statement that has nothing to do with my objection.

I argued that the point raisen is a good point, and gave the reasons why. You disagreed and said my argument was irrelevant.
Exercise: Revise 1 and 2 in view of this.

&gt;No, it isn't. I've read comments. ""Also age of colonization and invasion and slavery"" does not have same meaning as ""Portugese are evil"".

Indeed, if you hyperbolically reduce a sentence it stops having meaning. That's not what I fought against. I fought against the _factual incorrectness_ of that original comment. I keep saying this over and over, and you keep hearing what you want.

&gt;1) Technically I didn't say that your comments are hostile responses.

I cannot find any useful meaning in this sentence to advance the discussion.

&gt;2) What is hostile response is in eye of beholder. 
Not being outright dickish or having nice style for example doesn't prevent one from being hostile.

I did not intend to be hostile. ""In the eye of the beholder"" will allow you to say anything. For example, right now I feel you are insulting me, because you have deliberately disregarded all my structured arguments and are accusing me of being hostile for some reason that only you can ""behold"". This is insulting in my eyes.

&gt;I've labeled exactly one of your statements as irrelevant, which wasn't even argument.

See above. It was an argument supporting the idea that the point was a good point.

&gt;1. Neither of those things were supposed to be arguments either. Do you think that every statement is argument?
2. I explained why your statement (not argument) was irrelevant. You responded with ridiculous question. There is no way to have discussion if one can't correctly interpret text.

The majority of Muslim countries in the world have a very wealthy elite class with exceptionally privileged quality of life. The rich and powerful in these countries have not changed any power structures or systems in their own countries to better the lives of their citizens or the common man. 
Is this reflected on at all by Muslim immigrants who flee to the western world?
There isn’t a daily wave of western immigrants struggling to get into Islamic countries, is this ever a consideration these Muslim immigrants ever think about or are they really that brainwashed? 

The Muslim world is always very good at finger pointing and preaching what is good or what should or should not happen but for over 500 years no Islamic country has contributed to world peace, human freedom and/or innovation by any measurable global manner.

He claims he doesn't shake the hand of anybody, yet a whole court went up being busy asking him loaded questions that would also make any traditionalist Christian struggle with a ""GG compliant answer"".

Case in point: They ask him if Muhammed caricatures should be allowed to be shown, which according to the Quran they shouldn't, but Germany also has [blasphemy laws on the books](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stgb/englisch_stgb.html#p1570) which have been plenty used to [slap fines on people being critical of Christianity](https://www.spiegel.de/panorama/justiz/gotteslaesterung-gericht-verurteilt-ehemaligen-lehrer-in-luedinghausen-a-1079284.html). So what's the *right* answer here? 

Quite a few Muslims have tried to sue on the basis of that law, afaik not a single one has won.

Then there's the fact that the circumcision of children, for religious reasons, is actually also a rather blatant breach of the German GG and the UDHR. Yet nobody wants to make much of a stinker about that topic because that would also affect Judaism, just like this ruling would affect any Haredi Jew, but I guess the headline ""Germany denies Jewish person citizenship over their religion"" just ain't as mainstream palatable as the Muslim version.

Google Operation Bullfinch if you want some evidence and believe me this business hurts and upsets me as it directly impacts my local community and ultimately tars me with the same brush and unfortunately isn't an isolated incident.

Jumping on the bigot bandwagon and trying to shut down discord around this topic doesn't help the situation and it was fear of this that exacerbated the problem in several real life examples. You ask for statistics, ofcourse I haven't imperically tracked every debate and argument I've had with fellow Muslims, but anecdotally, of all the times the conversation about Asia Bibi (also google it if you don't know the background) the overwhelming consensus was her treatment and death sentence was justified. It was particularly disheartening to see this view held by British Muslims who had been born, raised and educated in the UK and who held a variety of professional jobs. 

Your pseudo outrage at my original comments pales in comparison to the sheer exasperation I felt trying to explain to, otherwise intelligent progressive people, that in 2019 no one should be put to death for blasphemy, all while passing a spliff between us and waiting for the coke dealer to turn up so we could head out into town.",,/r/europe/comments/jdcyax/man_denied_german_citizenship_for_refusing_to/g98ggoe/,DaddyShark28989,1603038783
969,"Like I previously said: Wanna see some genetic researches (as that's what you mean when you say the Greeks have no connection to their ancestors) that prove you, not just slightly, but completely wrong. You even used to Arvanites as an example, a group of people that no only had part of the Greek DNA in it as many of them were living in Northern Epirus but a group that also assimilated willingly and quickly. Not just culturally but genetically too. 

That is what happens when a smaller group of genes enters a larger one. It doesn't overtake it, nor does it dilute it unless it is of significant size. It simply get assimilated with time. Same thing happened to every group of people that you mentioned. Even the Slav, who were the most populous, rarely make up more than 10% in a Greek person's gene pool as shown by studies, which I am more than happy to provide.

Even Egypt that has been dominated by the Arab culture retains 70%+ of it ancient gene pool. And 70% shows a great dilution, too. Greece is at 90%, showing minor dilution over time.

In any case, as I saw you typing in Albanian in some comment I will just say: Get you head out of your ass. The Arvanites were and are a part of the Greek history but they were in no way as numerous as you might believe. No, they did not win the Greek was of Independence for the Greeks and no Greece was not ""speaking Albanian"" until a Bavarian created the modern Greek language. 2 minutes of research are enough to understand that.

But that is typically for the first generation though, the subsequent generation of offsprings of immigrants do integrate but on case by case basis, many of the latter feel alienated. If you notice, many Islamic terror attacks in Europe were perpetrated by Western-born Muslims and they are radicalised because they feel not being seen as locals but as perpetual foreigners despite being born and raised in their respective countries. So they don't feel they belong in the country and culture they knew all their life, instead they turn to the ancestral culture of their parents which contain extremist elements ready to exploit vulnerabilities.

While I can't speak about shaking hands specifically, LGBT and womens rights is absolutely not respected by the majority of muslims. Hell, in the UK alone, effectively half the population thinks homosexuality should be outlawed and nearly half think women ""should always obey their husband"". While the latter might not sound so shocking, when you consider most conservative muslims don't live in europe, you may reconsider your quote. 

If you were to say that most muslims in your area dont have integration problems then I wouldn't disagree, as that is the case with me, but the ultra westernized muslims I interact with are a very small sample of the larger global muslim population.

But there is now, and the society has been doing just as well without handshaking. Apparently it's easy to get rid of this supposed pillar of social interactions. 

&gt;People would bat an eye, and they do, if a man shakes the hands of all the men present but refuses to shake the hand of a woman. I've seen it happen. Here it had more consequences given the context.

My entire point is that the consequences in this case are ridiculous. His refusal could at worst be interpreted as rude, but it in no way makes him incompatible with the society he's been living and working in the past decade. 

&gt;You are being willfully obtuse. Him not shaking hands with her based on her gender has nothing to do with her being the superior in this instance. If anything it demonstrates what lengths he is willing to take to not shake the hands of women even when it would be in his benefit.

Your argument was that this is about treating women as equals, but this is nonsense. If he'd done this in any other context, nothing would happen, but here it resulted in life changing consequences. 

They're not equal, and he's being painfully made aware of that fact. 

&gt;So what? Seriously? Not eating pork and sausages isn't of as much consequence compared to behaving differently around women because you see them as inferior.

Was it because of sexual temptation or because he sees women as inferior? He's saying that he's promised his wife not to do it, so he obviously respects women enough to hold on to that promise and face unjust consequences.

It was a surreal experience, the departure hall was almost empty at about 07:50 on a workday.

All but one of the four terminals were closed, check in was super quick, as was security.

Allmost all shops and cafés were closed after security. I got to my gate and there were a few people there, perhaps 15 or so...

But I was the only one called to my flight, it was bizzare getting on the bus to go out to the plane, it felt as a mix of being a VIP and being abducted.

The plane I flew on was unmarked, it was from a very small airline, it was a Fokker 50, and as I got on it it kind of felt like it was my own personal plane...

It was just me, a flight attendant and two pilots, really odd to me, the last few years I had flown to and from London for work once a year, and have never flown in a private plane.

Anyway, we take off and flew to my destination, my bag was the only one on the baggage belt, I did my work, and checked into a hotel, everything was quiet, that is the main thing I remember, everything was quiet and fast.

The next day in the morning, I head to the airport to fly back, it was a tiny airport, it had only 4/5 gates, this time there was a massive 100% increase in the ammount of passengers flying.

We were two passengers on the plane, so it didn't feel that strange, I sat in the middle of the plane, the other passenger sat in the front of the plane.

We got hand sanitizer from the flight attendant this time, and the other passenger wore a mask throughout the flight.

We landed, and I got on the bus, the other passenger was old and needed more assitance, so she got a special transfer to the terminal.

HOWEVER inferring some kind of prejudiced reason as to why they’re not wearing them (“they wanna seem manly and strong”) simply based on their ethnicity is where the logic ends and racist nuances begin.

For example in my personal experience, a lot of immigrants don’t trust our “Ämter“ or official government institutions as more often than not, they’ll  get treated like shit if their German is not perfect or theyre poor or jobless.So when the government rightfully proclaims a mask mandate, people are skeptical.

1369,"How many Armenians do you think remained in the areas Azerbaijan managed to take over during this war? If you can't figure out, let me know. Why do you think Azerbaijan is shelling residential areas of cities since day 1? Do you think the Syrian jihadis Azerbaijan imported are going to be nice to christian Armenian civilians if they stay? Do you think Azerbaijan's president saying they will drive every Armenian dog out of Karabakh is an indication they want the Armenians to remain? Do you think executing POW-s and posting videos, or posting photos with severed heads of Armenians is a sign they want Armenians to continue living there? 

It is naive to think Europe will do anything, Armenians will fight their fights by themselves as before. Even our ""ally"" Russia, because of whom we are being constantly ostracized here, does jack shit to help. I think this was the worst miscalculation that all our different leaderships did throughout the last 30 years.

Firstly, Giertch wasn't arrested. He was detained and then has been released on bond. Prosecutors didn't even request from court to arrest him.

Secondly, there is no rule in the Polish law which would say, that to detain an attorney, the prosecution office needs to consult with the bar association.

Thirdly, from what I read, during searching of Giertych's law firm, representatives of Warsaw Bar Association were present.

1474,"I think the trial period should cover most cases you'd want an intern.

You work for 3-6 months, get paid for your work and receive training. Similar to the internship the idea is that you're learning skills that you then use in the company as an employee or at a different similar position in the company if they wish. 
During that time either employer or employee can end the contract for any reason with no further obligations.

This will incentivise the company to actually train you and give you a job afterwards since they are paying for it. 
If they have no intention of hiring after then probably the job/intern position is of no value anyway.

If the trainee turns out to not be suitable then the employer can just cut their contract during the training period with no obligation for unemployment pay, so they don't have to worry about costs other than the basic pay, which if it's work worth doing they should be paying for anyway.

Only thing I can think of to watch out for is companies endlessly cutting the contract and rehiring the same person to keep them as an indefinite trainee who can be cut at any time. A rule saying that if someone has worked in a position for X months out of the last 12 months even with small breaks in contract then they should be considered an employee and owed any applicable benefits.",,/r/europe/comments/jcimj5/european_parliament_calls_for_ban_on_unpaid/g96voe6/,Muff_in_the_Mule,1603003942

1523,"Naples (Italian: *Napoli*; Ancient Greek: Νεάπολις) is the regional capital of Campania and the third-largest city of Italy, after Rome and Milan, with a population of 967,069 within the city's administrative limits as of 2017. Its province-level municipality is the third-most populous metropolitan city in Italy with a population of 3,115,320 residents, and its metropolitan area (that stretches beyond the boundaries of the Metropolitan City of Naples) is the second-most populous metropolitan area in Italy and the 7th-most populous urban area in the European Union.

First settled by Greeks in the first millennium BC, Naples is one of the oldest continuously inhabited urban areas in the world. In the ninth century BC, a colony known as Parthenope or Παρθενόπη was established on the Island of Megaride. In the 6th century BC, it was refounded as Neápolis. The city was an important part of Magna Graecia, played a major role in the merging of Greek and Roman society, and was a significant cultural centre under the Romans.

It served as the capital of the Duchy of Naples (661–1139), then of the Kingdom of Naples (1282–1816), and finally of the Two Sicilies until the unification of Italy in 1861. Naples is also considered a capital of the Baroque, beginning with the artist Caravaggio's career in the 17th century, and the artistic revolution he inspired. Due to poverty and lack of opportunity, waves of Italians emigrated from Naples in the late 19th and early 20th century, with most going to the United States, where they settled in industrial cities. Between 1925 and 1936, Naples was expanded and upgraded by Benito Mussolini's government. During the later years of World War II, it sustained severe damage from Allied bombing as they invaded the peninsula. The city received extensive post-1945 reconstruction work.

Since the late 20th century, Naples has had significant economic growth, helped by the construction of the Centro Direzionale business district and an advanced transportation network, which includes the Alta Velocità high-speed rail link to Rome and Salerno and an expanded subway network. Naples is the third-largest urban economy in Italy, after Milan and Rome. The Port of Naples is one of the most important in Europe. In addition to commercial activities, it is home to the Allied Joint Force Command Naples, the NATO body that oversees North Africa, the Sahel and Middle East.",Bucharest,/r/europe/comments/jda4u1/downtown_napoli_italy/g96lawe/,pistruiata,1602996409

1526,"I spent some time working in Hungary and there's more to it than this. Not defending Viktor Orban's anti-LGBTQ policies or in any way saying he's a humanist leader, but Orban was hardly the only one in Hungary condemning the naive open-door policy towards economic-migrants-claiming-to-be-refugees that many countries in the West have had (esp. the USA, UK and Canada), and his condemnations and hostility towards Islam were shared by many liberal Hungarians, including many in the gay and feminist circles in Budapest where I was stationed. And as for George Soros, I'm sorry to speak bluntly about this but he brought a lot of the hostility on himself by underwriting many NGO's using shady practices (at a minimum) to try to smuggle economic migrants into Hungary. That's essentially human trafficking no matter what pretty platitudes are attached to it, and if anything Soros and other supporters of such activities should feel relieved they haven't been imprisoned for human trafficking across borders.  I feel like Reddit sometimes has this naively idealistic view of politics and the politicians who actually bring about the tough-love policies that protect a nation--often unpleasant but necessary--from demographic and cultural upheaval. 

Expecting that kind of needle-threading from politicians in Hungary, the Czech Republic and Poland--to oppose mass immigration whilst also being liberal and humanist otherwise--is asking for a unicorn, and the reality esp. in ex-Iron Curtain countries like that is that you're going to have to hold your nose and accept some of their backwardness to have someone in office vouching for strict borders and cultural preservation. Orban is no doubt coarse and downright troglodytic on many issues to say the least, but the practical political reality on the ground is that he's the only respected figure in Hungary with the history and gravitas there to unite the government around a coherent policy to block the kind or refugee and economic migrant streams that would destabilise his country. He's going to be very imperfect esp. in the eyes of us in Western Europe, but that's the political reality right now. Perhaps if the more mainstream liberal parties in his and neighbouring countries were more honest and realistic about the dangers of mass immigration to their small, densely populated countries, and the realities of Muslim difficulties in assimilating in the West, there wouldn't be so much need for the Orbans and Kaczynskis to be in office putting their foot down instead.",,/r/europe/comments/jcu5m6/french_police_make_arrests_after_teacher_beheaded/g96lnj6/,auldlangy,1602996623

1529,"&gt;Conceived by Tsar [Alexander III](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Alexander-III-emperor-of-Russia), the construction of the [railroad](https://www.britannica.com/technology/railroad) began in 1891 and proceeded simultaneously in several sections—from the west (Moscow) and from the east (Vladivostok) and across intermediate reaches by way of the Mid-Siberian Railway, the Transbaikal Railway, and other lines. Originally, in the east, the Russians secured Chinese permission to build a line directly across [Manchuria](https://www.britannica.com/place/Manchuria) (the Chinese Eastern Railway) from the Transbaikal region to Vladivostok; this trans-Manchurian line was completed in 1901. After the [Russo-Japanese War](https://www.britannica.com/event/Russo-Japanese-War) of 1904–05, however, Russia feared Japan’s possible takeover of Manchuria and proceeded to build a longer and more difficult [alternative](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/alternative) route, the [Amur](https://www.britannica.com/place/Amur) Railway, through to Vladivostok; this line was completed in 1916. The Trans-Siberian Railroad thus had two completion dates: in 1904 all the sections from Moscow to Vladivostok were linked and completed running through Manchuria; in 1916 there was finally a Trans-Siberian Railroad wholly within Russian territory.

Marine Le Pen and many other FN officials are quite vocal about protecting LGBTQ communities, and openly pro-Jewish loudly condemning ex. the Islamist attacks on the French kosher Jewish supermarket and Jewish schools. There may be some parties doing what you're saying but from my experience working in France and Belgium, it's hard to make blanket statements like this. As a rule the populists in Europe are going to be quite vigorous in emphasising ideas of national unity behind their traditional culture and religion (same as I've seen for their counterparts in traditional parties in Asian countries), but for at least some of them esp. in the EU, a part of their embrace of Western values is the protection of Jewish and LGBTQ minorities who if anything are most directly in the cross-hairs of Muslim militants.",,/r/europe/comments/jcu5m6/french_police_make_arrests_after_teacher_beheaded/g96m88o/,auldlangy,1602996972
1535,"&gt; but just feels there's no point in keeping bashing Britain here, a bad deal was made  

Because this is not a matter of people ganging up on Britain to bash/mock/banter for shits and giggles. This is a direct result of British actions that will not end this year once Brexit ""finalizes"".  
Just yesterday there were emails from the Tories saying something along the lines of ""omg, guyyeess, those nasty EU fucks won't give us a deal, we don't know why, it's not fault honestly, we rlly wanted a deal"". They keep lying over and over and over again, so the reactions will definitely not stop now.  
I expect people to also continue to mock and make fun of them when more effects of Brexit are shown, specifically because they lied through their teeth and there's few things that are more gratifying than making fun of a liar.  
And the audacity of calling mocking lies and corruption ""anti-british"" is frankly astonishing. I wouldn't even dream of saying someone's anti-romanian because he was mocking one of our corrupt fucks.  
And I find it even more funny nowadays since just a couple of years ago Brits were throwing a lot of mean-spirited and sometimes bigoted attacks towards us and eastern europeans and when people pointed it out they just went ""it's just bantah mate, hehe"". Well, it's our turn now.  

&gt; There's no need for all of this it's not the end of the world.  

On that point, I beg to differ. Well, not literally, but more in the sense that I'm already pretty convinced that Brexit will lead to UK performing Seppuku by means of Scottish independence and maybe Welsh independence too who knows, and Ireland reunification.",Romania,/r/europe/comments/jcqy2g/macron_on_brexit/g96maap/,ceproastaimata,1602997008

You are wrong comparing internship to free graphic design. In Uni you are taught by people with marginal to moderate practical experience and you are fine with it. Maybe some retired or semi retire practitioners too, but it's unlikely. So in many fields internship is the only way of learning how real professionals are working, meanwhile you are not going to contribut besides making coffee.  

I know how it feels, I was working for free for 3 months in legal office after I had 2 years of experience in tax office (intern for 2 years, but paid... 2,5 euro an hour :)).

1800,"Do not forget the poems! He wrote a fair amount of homo-erotic poems.
Here is one for Francesco Algarotti, nick named the Swan of Padova.  

From Königsberg to Monsieur Algarotti, Swan of Padua

""This night, vigorous desire in full measure,
Algarotti wallowed in a sea of pleasure.
A body not even a Praxitiles fashions
Redoubled his senses and imbued his passions
Everything that speaks to eyes and touches hearts,
Was found in the fond object that enflamed his parts.
Transported by love and trembling with excitement
In Cloris’ arms he yields himself to contentment
The love that unites them heated their embraces
And tied bodies and arms as tightly as laces.
Divine sensual pleasure! To the world a king!
Mother of their delights, an unstaunchable spring,
Speak through my verses, lend me your voice and tenses
Tell of their fire, acts, the ecstasy of their senses!
Our fortunate lovers, transported high above
Know only themselves in the fury of love:
Kissing, enjoying, feeling, sighing and dying
Reviving, kissing, then back to pleasure flying.
And in Knidos’ grove, breathless and worn out
Was these lovers’ happy destiny, without doubt.
But all joy is finite; in the morning ends the bout.
Fortunate the man whose mind was never the prey
To luxury, or grand airs, one who knows how to say
A moment of climax for a fortunate lover
Is worth so many aeons of star-spangled honour""

There is no evidence that Leopold II (who never went to the congo) was involved in any shape or form.

If you actually read how anti-slavery he was and to what lengths he went to stop slavery and abuse in Congo between factions, he is one of the nicest leaders on that map up there.

The fact 'Belgians' feel any kind of shame for him, while France is erecting statues of Napoleon who slaughtered and invaded Belgium as a past-time, is insane. I have never seen a country with such misplaced self-guilt as Belgium.

Again, given that the polio vaccine killed many people initially, with the kind of rules the FDA has in place today the development of the vaccine would have been halted. This would result in tens of millions of people living in absolute misery.

Today, novel drugs for cancer, alzhimer, parkinsons, and other diseases are withheld from the public because they are either deemed too dangerous, or are never fully pursued due to the immense costs.

The support for preventing tens to hundreds of millions being helped due to a few deaths that might happen is a massive fallacy and an extremely dangerous one. It has everything to do with loss aversion, the idea that people consider a loss to be much more significant then an equal gain.

&gt;Other countries have far more medical regulation than America does and have much more effective healthcare systems. Regulation obviously doesn't hold them back, it makes the system safer and more accessible.

It's easy for them to do that since most of R&amp;D still happens in the US. So it's easy to take something that someone else has paid for and distribute it to people. It's far more difficult to create something that will help people who have never been helped before.

He was a Portuguese explorer that lead a Spanish expedition (Edit: the first sailing around the world), in a moment where Portugal and Spain were not very friendly to each other.

Spanish people were suspicious of him, Portuguese people were suspicious of him.

He was a very stubborn SOB, not a nice guy at all,  but with balls like coal buckets.

He died defending the retreat of some of his men.

From Wikipedia:

"" In the immediate aftermath of the circumnavigation, few celebrated Magellan for his accomplishments, and he was widely discredited and reviled in Spain and his native Portugal. The Portuguese regarded Magellan as a traitor for having sailed for Spain. In Spain, Magellan's reputation suffered due to the largely unflattering accounts of his actions given by the survivors of the expedition. ""

1932," A direct application of the law isn't always the best solution to some conflicts when it comes to real world issues. The Aegean and Eastern Mediterranean EEZ issues are one such case. Greece using the EEZ laws to their maximum potential would completely isolate Turkey's western coast from both its southern and northern coasts, effectively cutting off the northern and southern coasts of Turkey from each other in the process. You must realize that this would only lead to even worse conflict between the two nations later down the line.

 There are many cases where two countries settled their EEZ boundaries diplomatically through negotiation, due to certain special circumstances. Greece's current EEZ claims seek to isolate the western coast of Turkey in the Aegean and achieve total dominance through linking their own EEZ with that of Cyprus' in the Eastern Mediterranean.

 This issue can't be solved with a direct and maximalistic application of the current laws. Greece is rejecting offers of solving the matter through negotiation because they know the laws favor them. By rejecting negotiation and trying to completely leave Turkey out to dry, they're only serving to destabilize the situation in the Aegean.

The former is entirely in the Greek heartland (including today's South Albania/North Epirus) and the latter lay in what is today Central Albania. What was Epirus Novus, also called Greek Illyria? The colonization of the area by Greeks, so much that they assimilated locals and they became a majority. Same thing happened in today's Northern Thrace (South Bulgaria).

Unpaid work devalues way more for students and unemployed people then people imagine. It literally devalues the value of work for everyone in society.

Muslims of MENA and North Africa aren't frankly open to self criticism. If it were the case, these countries would be seen as examples of freedom of speech and enlightenment.

Vietnam was 22 percent, Denmark, 18 percent.](https://jyllands-posten.dk/indland/ECE11949593/stor-andel-af-indvandrerunge-har-faaet-en-dom/) Source and updated figures [here.](https://unitos.dk/2018/11/14/1987-convicted/)

Finally, we have we compiled a [crime index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_to_Denmark#/media/File:Denmark_crime_index_year_2015_immigrant_men_15-79_yo_per_country._Adjusted_for_age.png) some years ago. The numbers speak for themselves, but you can read more on the methodology [here](http://www.dst.dk/Site/Dst/Udgivelser/GetPubFile.aspx?id=20704&amp;sid=indv2016)

Unfortunately Denmark specifically doesn't have a study which controls for crime and poverty, but you can use the [official statistics website to pull that data.](https://www.dst.dk/da). While it's true that MENA migrants earn less than Danes, our generous welfare system means *no one has to live in poverty.* This confounds social researchers, and many have shifted goalposts to *inequality.* I.e. if one group earns less than another, maybe *that* explains higher crime. Indeed we see similar phenomenon in other countries. This is an area of hot social *and* philosophical research. If a man is well fed, has a home, and all the creature comforts he might need, why should he turn to crime just because his neighbour has even more? You'll need to ask the MENA migrants that.

2292,"&gt;You defend an article, that compares a group op people that want to serve the world with a group of murderous lunatics that wanted to destroy the world

You are such a moron. The article doesn't do that and either you are to dumb to read and understand it or your hate boner for the NZZ and the AFD disabled your brain. You perfectly show how easy it is to manipulate and radicalize people. 

&gt;All because you want to drive your SUV to the bakery instead of walking 100m.  

You know nothing about the people you are attacking yet you still resort to unfounded accusations. Prove that I drive a SUV. 

&gt; There is a reason why the only people that defended that bullshit  article were the successors of that group of murderous lunatics, the  AFD. 

Since you are such a big fan of science go ahead and show me some proof that only the AFD agreed with that article, I am sure you already have a representative study at hand. Or did you form your opinion in your twitter bubble?

&amp;#x200B;

And as for TESLA. How many cares did they sell compared to the German care industry during the last 5 years? Show me some sources that the German car industry is ""in great danger to go bankrupt"" because they didn't focus on EVs or is that just another one of your stupid opinions? How many people can afford expensive TESLA cars unless there are massive subsides payed by other tax payers? The German car industry is building and selling the cars people want to buy, no matter how much you dislike it. The EV market is small compared to the ICE car market and it will stay like that until EVs are in an affordable price range or until some green idiots get to make laws that prohibit the sell of ICEs (deliberately destroying our industry). 

Btw TESLA is currently building a gigafactory near Berlin. Who are the idiots who are trying to stop TESLA building it? Some industry hating environmental activists who are worried about ground water and a small part of forest. 

The only ones who are destroying our wealth and industry are radical climate activits and the green party who's demands increase the cost of energy and who try to stop any construction of infrastructure and industry. 

I still haven't heared a single solution to the climate crisis and a feasible path to a climate neutral society without ruining our economy and increasing our cost of living from you.

The problem as always is extremism, and I do include those who feel that this was justified in that as do you because that thinking creates these monsters - but this isn’t every Muslim.

Fight for unity not division, it is not the fault of a peaceful practitioner of Islam who finds this aborrhent just like it is not every white lads fault that freaks like Elliot Rodgers kill a bunch of people. It is the thinking that excuses it that is responsible, we must accept that extremism doesn’t come from nowhere and tackle the kernel of truth to the insane demands. This isn’t a left/right/religious thing it is just division, let’s work as a continent to discuss things we dislike and be open and of course anyone who cannot participate in this and the rules of society no matter their race gender or creed can be put in a hole never to see the light of day. I do agree that immigrants who ascribe to radical Islam need to be send back to the shit holes they crawled from as I can think of no better lesson to teach them regarding the truth of these extremist beliefs. 

Let’s not be like the yanks who excuse despicable acts from their own political aisles and instead stand firm on our values, like this poor teacher in France and not use it as an excuse to foment even more hate.

Chechnyan (plural Chechnyans)

A native or inhabitant of Chechnya.

After the Caucasus it's Europe's main highland, so maybe don't.

2377,"&gt; You are just playing dumb, ""NZ did is with 5 million people and fuck all density, EU can do the same""

You have to prove to me that population density is a factor in how we can deal with COVID. Ever heard of burden of proof? You are saying my assessment is incorrect, so you need to get some proof to demonstrate it. [Here](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01944363.2020.1777891) is a study saying density is counteracted by connectivity as a factor, so in fact density might have the *opposite* effect on COVID response. Great argument, mate. So much for taking the time to study and digesting information. You are clueless.

&gt;And then comparing us to Asia who have went through this before and already learnt these mistakes...

And I linked you the GHSI, which states European countries (and the US) were supposed to be *better* prepared than Asian countries, but now evidently aren't. 

&gt;You add literally nothing constructive, just bullshit and you think it is helpful?

My constructive argument is that a full lockdown can eradicate the virus. You never demonstrated how this is incorrect, except by saying it's an unrealistic proposal. Which is just your worthless opinion tbh. Imagine I am saying building a school in a town is the solution to illiteracy and your counter-argument is ""well, it's really hard to do and I am not sure we could even pull it off, building a school"". That's an analogy of your argument. That the proposal to do the obviously correct thing is ""unrealistic"" and thus should just disregarded.

&gt;I asked you to take your time and digest the info and do some research, you didn't, you just came back with another rambling comment.

The fuck are you talking about? lol. You accuse me of hindsight, even though I have proven to you that I made the same comment at least two months ago. You are ignoring shit I write. Constantly. I am evidently far better informed on this issue compared to you.  

&gt;You act like the EU has done nothing which is crazy, you compare to NZ and Asia but you don't even know what they did that was so successful and don't take any context in at all.

I have said **nowhere** the EU has done nothing. Go ahead, quote where I have said this in comments. I dare you. See, this is why I lost all respect for you over the last few comments. You just make shit up and then gaslight me about it. Disgraceful. Here is what I said about the EU and you obviously didn't even read:

&gt; **No, the EU is doing more than some member states and I want the EU to have a more centralized control in this situation. Mainly because we can't have both Schengen and national policies for Covid.**

Also, NZ has no cases. Sounds successful to me. The countries I listed also have vastly lower mortality rates, so whatever they are doing is evidently working and we should do whatever they are doing, which is harsher lockdowns. In the metric of deaths, one of the best (larger) European countries, Germany, is ranked 66th. Vietnam and Thailand are ranked in the 180s. You keep talking about context but you give me nothing to build a counterargument on. ""Uuuuh, they are different because of island and smaller and fake and no testing. So we can't make any comparative statements."" is the laziest argument I have ever read on this website.

&gt;As I said, you are passionate and that is good but you are misusing that, you are the exact same as the people who protest masks just on the other side of the argument, you use the same tactics and same ""logical"" leaps as they do.

I don't care at all how you perceive me, dawg. I have the only example of eradicating COVID on my side of the argument. New Zealand got rid of its COVID cases by doing what I am proposing. Or more precisely, I am following this line of argument, because I have seen it work in NZ and other countries and want the same here, so **less people die.** Get out of here with your horse-shoe bullshit, comparing me to anti-maskers. If anything, people who aren't willing to go for a full-lockdown are the ones who are okay with people dying. You are presenting the ""well, we have to take it slow and can't rush things""-line of arguments that I constantly hear from people that don't believe in climate change as well. 

&gt;Best of luck to you, hopefully it all gets better soon.

Yeah, continue hoping. My prognosis if we don't get our shit together, by spring there will be a huge outbreak all across Europe and we will just be forced into a lockdown anyways. It will be widely unpopular and badly executed, so it won't be as effective as a controlled closure. The same problems as we had earlier in the year will happen again. You will find more and more people who will argue on the side of ""well, a couple thousands deaths per day isn't too bad if you think about it"", while our economy suffers over the span of 1,5 years instead of biting the bullet for a month and returning to normal. When that happens, you are welcome to return to this comment section tell me how right I was.

2399,"&gt;Again you failed to answer my question ..do you see nagorno karabakh as an independent state or annexation by Armenia ?

This is not a genuine question as of course Nagorno Karabakh is an independent state by it's own Law. Armenia is by intention not recognizing it as it would prevent the peaceful settlement of this conflict. Something Armenia as well as Azerbaijan agreed to, observed by OSCE. So, the argument that NK is not even recognized by Armenia is one of the weakest you could search for. Of course, as soon as this dispute is settled NK would hold a referendum to join Armenia. But nice try to distract. 

Since you did not respond to my previous comment, here again: If Nagorno Karabakh is  illegitimate so is Azerbaijan as both countries seceded under the same Law on secession from the USSR:

&gt;Article  3. In a Union republic which includes within its structure autonomous  republics, **autonomous oblasts**, or autonomous okrugs, **the referendum is  held separately for each autonomous formation.** **The people of autonomous  republics and autonomous formations retain the right to decide  independently** the question of remaining within the USSR or within the  seceding Union republic, and also **to raise the question of their own  state-legal status.**",,/r/europe/comments/jc8m74/armenia_to_impose_economic_sanctions_on_turkey/g93jc5l/,Cultourist,1602938522

Greece is currently the only European country for which the German government has not issued a travel warning due to the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. Cyprus is also considered safe, with the exception of the occupied ones.

With yesterday's update of the relevant directives, the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs advises citizens to avoid ""unnecessary"" travel to all European countries, or their areas where there is a significant increase in cases of coronavirus infection. Decisions, as clarified, are made on the basis of epidemiological data from the Robert Koch Institute.

Indicatively, as a whole ""high risk"" countries are considered - among others - France, Spain, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Belgium, Slovakia and Malta, while ""dangerous"" are considered areas of Poland, Italy, Austria, Denmark and Bulgaria. A special case is Norway, for which there is a general warning, but not because of an increase in cases, but because Oslo has included Germany in the ""danger zones"" and imposes quarantine on anyone returning from there.

Regarding Greece, the German Foreign Ministry points out that despite the increase in cases, the country is moderately affected by the coronavirus, while stating that the main emphasis is on Attica, Epirus, Western Macedonia and some islands.",,/r/europe/comments/jcsu9a/greece_is_the_only_country_in_europe_for_which_no/g93aneu/,IASIPxIASIP,1602930622

2429,"I’m talking long term, as in, currently we’re seeing a grasp for power between the major world superpowers. London just lost every sort of respectable global representation and weight. Sure, they’re still part of the G7, so they didn’t need EU representation there, but that’s mostly it. As far as sovereignty from foreign superpowers and their markets goes, London just took a huge hit. On a global scale where they’ve hugely partaken in globalisation, they’re now coverless. The EU can’t and won’t protect them anymore from China, Russia or the US. 

They have no powers in the council anymore, and if they want the EU to allow them to somewhat partake in the bin market, they’ll have to follow rules they’ll have no say in, just as do Switzerland and countries in a similar situation. The UK is not special, it was absurd from the very beginning that they thought they’d be treated differently.

If Scotland were to join the EU, not only would they have a voice that’s being heard, as do smaller countries like the Netherlands, Austria and Belgium, which let me remind you, as things stand now, these small countries have VETO POWER ON EVERY EUROPEAN DECISION, but they’d also still have the representation on a global level of one of the global superpowers. What eu-sceptics don’t seem to be able to grasp is, that alone, they’re not only vulnerable, but insignificant and an open target for the big markets of China and the US that are only waiting to exploit us.

Scotland would still be a, and I’m not trying to be insulting here, partially annoying member, considering a bit more than one third of them are eurosceptics, which would lead to European progress being slowed down. So I’m not saying they absolutely have to join. What I’m saying is that not only would they directly benefit from rejoining the common market, but as far as 20 years from now goes, Scotland would already highly benefit from being an EU member.",Milan,/r/europe/comments/jch5kz/a_little_over_a_year_ago_one_of_our_scottish_meps/g93ap2g/,talentedtimetraveler,1602930672

2439,"Eh. As I see it, this sort of blustering - like Johnson's admittedly more graceless one - can be useful for getting people on one's ""side"" fired up but is detrimental when it comes to getting things done. 

A No Deal would harm both the UK and the EU. 

The UK would certainly not face economic collapse because of it and neither would the EU, of course - the UK would remain one of the most prosperous countries of the world and the EU would remain one of the most powerful unions - but the impact of such a decision would still be considerably detrimental for both. 

It can be argued that such an outcome would likely harm the UK more than the EU, and I would tentatively agree with that (with the caveat that predicting long-term economic consequences of international agreements - or lack thereof - is a chancy business in the best of circumstances); but if the EU faces economic repercussions from a no deal outcome (which will not be catastrophic on their own, but still are not something I'd particularly look forward to - especially considering the current COVID crisis), it will not console me much to know that the UK is faring even worse.

2577,"1) There is no deficit requirement for joining the EU; it applies to joining the euro. As you point out, Scots aren't keen on joining the euro.

2) Scotland is not allowed to run a deficit so it has none. You can argue that an independent Scotland would have an X% budgetary deficit, but you can't do that based purely looking at the status quo. Some things will cost more, some things will cost less, and you will gain and lose some sources of revenue. This won't just cancel out; the exact balance will depend on things like exit negotiations and future fiscal policy.

3) Fishing makes up less than 1% of Scotland's economy and workforce.

4) There are alternatives that would make the situation a lot simpler than Ireland. For example, if Scotland was in the EEA outside the customs Union and Schengen, you could maintain the CTA and have an independent trade relationship with the UK. Worth noting that the UK/Ireland situation needs to be resolved and would establish a precedent should Scotland want to be a full member of the EU.

5) EU accession does not work by a queue system. Let me repeat that since this myth keeps being brought up: there is no queue. Scotland needs to meet the Copenhagen criteria to join the EU, which, as part of a former EU member state, it will have no issue doing. The main challenge will be actually developing the institutions required of a state (comprehensive taxation system, diplomatic functions, a central bank, regulatory bodies, and so on). If you can develop the functions of a modern state, all you need is for there to be political will in the EU for Scotland to join.

I would still be against but would allow students to get paid significantly less if the apprenticeship is for their direct profession and is related to their studies.

Having a trainee benefits all sides as some work is done by someone else so the company still benefits from it. But for students, doing any kind of work still has some expenses, be it travel, eating out during work and so on. Its unfair to expect them to pay for it out of their own pocket and do work while learning and also not everyone could afford to do that, while being an apprentice would deny you the opportunity to work another job due to time constrains.

You should definitely do some research before you speak. They are the sea border. A simple drawing. In the detailed description of Cihat Yaycı, the continental shelf of the islands appears in white in the regions we have declared. However, according to the Lausanne treaty, no work has been done in areas where ownership is disputed. It was stated that there should be a discussion with Greece at the table and a decision should be reached. Guess what happened? Greece raised its flag to the islands with disputed ownership and armed certain islands. Then they tell us to come to the table. Which table? There is no table and we are not to blame. We landed all our ships in October and where was the European Union? Because the thing is, the European Union and Greece don't want to talk. Europe says they should accept what we say. So stop talking two-faced. Turkey has done everything for the republic on the table, but you did it consider as impotence. A typical complex country example. Turkey will be on site after that time. He will get what he wants by paying every price The economic embargo puts the economy, which is already in a difficult situation, to a deadlock, but the Turkish nation sees it as an attack on itself and shows resistance. When attacked Turkey's economy and the people of Turkey will do what techniques; Treaty of Montreux to shut down the throats necessary, to permit the flow of European refugees (who will also be supported indirectly, pay attention to the smugglers), Asia and Europe's most profitable bridges , will be closed to Europe's ambargoc companies (when the Russia and Turkey gone , roam the end of the world now) Turkey's balloon economy  will gone but it will establish an inward-looking economy from the very beginning.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV_trial_in_Libya

The HIV trial in Libya (or Bulgarian nurses affair) concerns the trials, appeals and eventual release of six foreign medical workers charged with conspiring to deliberately infect over 400 children with HIV in 1998, causing an epidemic at El-Fatih Children's Hospital in Benghazi, Libya. About 56 of the infected children had died by August 2007.

The defendants, arrested in 1999, were five Bulgarian nurses (often termed ""medics"") and a Palestinian medical intern. They were first sentenced to death, then had their case remanded to Libya's highest court, and were sentenced to death again, a penalty which was upheld by Libya's highest court in early July 2007. The six then had their sentences commuted to life in prison by a Libyan government panel. They were released following a deal reached with European Union representatives on humanitarian issues—the EU did not condone the guilty verdict in Libya against the six. On 24 July 2007, the five medics and the doctor were extradited to Bulgaria, where their sentences were commuted by the Bulgarian President Georgi Parvanov and they were freed. Furthermore, a controversy has arisen concerning the terms of release, which allegedly include an arms trade as well as a civilian nuclear cooperation agreement signed by French President Nicolas Sarkozy in July 2007. Both the French and Bulgarian presidents have denied that the two deals were related to the liberation of the six, although this has been alleged by a variety of sources, including Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, son of former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi.",Bulgaria,/r/europe/comments/jcabto/french_expresident_sarkozy_charged_with_criminal/g92thx8/,zar4er,1602912752

Hm, a think tank which is funded by the US government says stuff which fall in line with the US government. Againe ""Obama giving Obama a medal"" meme is in full force.

&gt; As presently postured, NATO cannot successfully defend the territory of its most exposed members. Fortunately, it will not require Herculean effort to avoid such a failure. Further gaming indicates that a force of about seven brigades, including three heavy armored brigades — adequately supported by airpower, land-based fires, and other enablers on the ground and ready to fight at the onset of hostilities — could suffice to prevent the rapid overrun of the Baltic states.

Yes, it is talking about Russia being able to take control of Estonia. It does not talk about Russia being able to somehow defeat NATO in the long run. Thus any of those hypotheticals are pointless, because Russia would not go in if it would be clear that it would loose.



_____________________________________________


But since we are at it, the same think tank also says in another [article](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR1879.html)

**However, many Russian policymakers appear to have increasingly concluded that the strategic goals of the United States and NATO are not compatible with the long-term security of the current regime in Moscow. While a direct attack on NATO is unlikely, Russia is likely to explore additional avenues to signal its displeasure with ongoing U.S. and NATO activities.**

**Posture enhancements that could affect strategic stability deserve special scrutiny. Given the centrality of Russia's nuclear deterrent to its security, Russia may be willing to run substantial risks to forestall further development of NATO capabilities that could threaten Russian leadership or command and control systems. Differing perceptions between the two sides over the implications of NATO development of these capabilities has the potential to lead to conflict.**

HMmmmm. What could that mean in simple terms? Even more instability, because Russia feels threatened by NATO. The difference is that NATO is massively superior to Russia, thus there is an actual threat as opposed to NATO's posturing.

It is common knowledge that most of Russia's shenanigans around their western borders is because they are threatened by NATO and are doing everything to stop them expanding (which is working apparently). Now Russia's shenanigans are used to make NATO even more threatening, even though Russia only did the shenanigans because NATO was already threatening. This will OBVIOUSLY solve problems. /s",,/r/europe/comments/jchthf/us_army_to_establish_forward_command_post_in/g92f6tq/,yawaworthiness,1602902013

2841,"&gt;What I'm getting at is that, it is not normal for you to think in the manner that you replied to the above poster, with the same breath saying we are ""defending interests"" and eliminating ""threats"" while at the same time you listed pretty much all your neighbouring countries as the ones that you got serious issues with. Issues that you are trying to resolve by of course projecting power upon others, in pretty much every case.

Let me ask you a question, do you justify ally intervention to Syria aganist ISIS? If yes you can keep reading otherwise don't bother yourself.

 [Turkish cities on the Syrian border attacked by ISIS and PYD](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/operation-peace-spring/ypg-pkk-rocket-attacks-injure-16-civilians-in-se-turkey/1609031) a million times and [Erdogan has been asking for a safe zone](https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2019/09/erdogan-pushes-syria-safe-zone-unga.html) to keep Turkish civilians safe and settle the Syrian immigrants (which accumulated to 3.6 million people and cost more than 40 billion dollars to Turkey). So Turkey kept diplomatically demanding a safe zone till August 2016 which was the start of Turkish intervention in Syria.

 So do you believe ISIS and PYD are not a greater threat to Turkey than the EU faced aganist ISIS? Don't you think this is a double standard that Turkey is humiliated for defending itself aganist terrorist organization just like the other allies did in Syria? 

&gt; Instead of resolving actual issues however, which can be hard I admit and most importantly can cost elections, the population of the country is slowly but steadily starts blaming everyone around them apart from the leadership, that brought them into this state to begin with.  

I realized this, too. Just a couple of years ago everyone was pissed off at Erdogan for its trigger-happy attitude towards threats but now people see that we have no choice but to fight back. No one in the west doesn't care if Turks are dying in the terrorist attacks and actually expect us to be happy with a terrorist puppet state on our Syrian and Iraq border.

2873,"I don't see point in lying. (I did spend most of the 2 weeks at inside as I just came to do etätyö and it took most of my day so I didn't loiter outside a lot anyway.) Finland has failed in some ways with the quarantine and I'm not surprised why people have done only half-assed quarantine. Nothing is mandatory and is just ""suggested"". At back home we're slapped with £470 fine if we need to quarantine and you get caught outside (they do checkups). You don't get to shops, busses etc. at all without appropriate mask and 2m gaps are enforced. You can visit other family members but there has to be max 6 people and if you get caught its time for a fine again.
 
It's shame it's not the same in Finland because I have a feeling that even those +200 cases per day we keep having could be a lot less with actual rules instead of just ""suggestions"". Finnish people are smart and that shows with how we have just 200-300 cases instead of 1100 we had in Scotland within 24h. (Finland and Scotland have about same amount of people in the country, their is just a lot smaller and they're more touchy feel compared to Finland). 

And also have someone who knows their stuff on the airport covid info point. I felt weirded out them saying I'm good to go only to hear 3 days later from another source that I should do a quarantine.

Open the borders and risk asymptomatic carriers spreading the virus earlier than expected and at an uncontrolled rate, before Germany is ready to handle at least its own people?

The government handled it decently well. You can't use feelings when it comes to life and death matters like a pandemic. Not if you want to at least be able to ensure the safety of your own people.

3047,"From the article:

In a resolution adopted on Thursday (8 October) with 574 votes to 77 and 43 abstentions, EU lawmakers urged member states to ensure that young people who enrol for the Youth Guarantee schemes are offered “good-quality, varied and tailored job, training, apprenticeship or internship offers, including fair remuneration”.

The text condemns the practice of unpaid internship as “a form of exploitation of young people’s work and a violation of their rights.”

“This battle against unpaid internships has been going on for a long time. For too long we have got used to unpaid traineeships but this has got to change,” European Parliament President David Sassoli told reporters last week, addressing concerns about a large number of unpaid interns and trainees working in EU institutions and across Europe.

MEP  Brando Benifei (S&amp;D) told reporters that “the European Parliament is now leading by example, and unpaid internships are illegal in the House. What we want now is for this to be replicated across the EU so that, once and for all, we rid ourselves of the problem of unpaid interns”.

Sassoli said the youth guarantee “is an important tool and sends out a message that interns deserve a decent wage”.",,/r/europe/comments/jcimj5/european_parliament_calls_for_ban_on_unpaid/g91rtie/,49orth,1602887369

3192,"In France, all impoverished areas have the same problems with poverty, drugs, violence and gangs. White banlieusards and maghrebi ones are not any different from the same gang/poverty issues.

The difference comes when you exclude the Maghrebi from societal life and they introspect it to be because of their origins and then go and join others who have that same understanding. That’s how you get large pockets of Algerian/Tunisian/Marocain people tying stronger to their background identities than a French one.

You can actually see this inside France too, mostly with Bretons. Bretons who move to Paris and get stuck in banlieues often form groups with others from Bretagne and become insular from others. It’s how excluded people will form community and identities.

It gets amplified as worse with people who recruit for jihadi groups targeting these isolated groups and seek to weaponize this dissatisfaction with being excluded in France. There’s a strong link with many homegrown Islamic terrorists and this cycle, in Marseille, Paris and elsewhere.

A very simple example are the Charlie Hebdo attackers. They followed this same cycle, and in their first jail term they came into contact with more radicalized individuals and where furthered along the pipeline.

3278,"&gt;Yes but obviously someone ordered the judicial system to do that. I don't think anyone other than Putin could or would give such a command, at least not without Putin's approval.

When you are the president people do favors for you without asking.


&gt;Can Putin resign, though? He seems too powerful for that, and too rich. 

Yes, he can, he’s getting old and tired.

&gt;Doesn't he basically own a share of all business going on inside Russia? 

Not really. It’s the government that owns the share, not him personally⁠, more like the group of people that forms budgets, government programs and controls cash flow

&gt;Russia is an authoritarian state. Of course those other oligarchs may do stuff on their own, but they don't seem to ever act against Putin's wishes, at leat not overtly.

3524,"For the 90s war, I definitely talk about that.  And I also believe in civilians' right to return to their homes, and I think Armenia and Artsakh should take more unilateral steps in that direction.

However, at the moment, it's not totally clear if it's both sides committing war crimes in anywhere near equal measure.  It's clear that a certain regime with a terrible terrible record on telling the truth (or allowing others to tell it) really wants everyone to think it's both sides.

Not just on war crimes, but on every single escalation and violation of civilisation norms - who attacked first, hiring jihads, human shields, being a terrible dictatorship...  The terrible dictatorship accuses the other side of literally every single thing it's caught doing.

But this is somewhat orthogonal to the question of recognition.  Azerbaijan, for example, deserves recognition despite whatever it does

If you recall, in the beginning of all of this, the NKAO voted peacefully for independence, and that was denied, and they were attacked, besieged and shelled, and then had Afghan mujahidin thrown at them, by the Azerbaijani authorities.

Pretty similar to what's going on now, really.

If the Azerbaijani authorities back then had just agreed to allow and honour a peaceful vote, instead of attacking and creating a war zone, then all those people would still be in their homes, and of course it could have negotiated much better terms, given the NKAO lines.

(I remind you that there were also hundreds of thousands of Armenian refugees from Azerbaijan, but the politicisation of that fact is noticeably different between the two societies.)

So, I agree with being hard and forcing honesty from both sides, however being neutral means applying the same standards, and it's fairly clear who is the aggressor here, and against any sort of compromise.

Azerbaijan has basically always threatened war unless it can impose terms (""autonomy"" under a terrible dictatorship that doesn't actually allow anyone in to see how that autonomy is respected) that would allow it to do genocide, and it has basically never ever proven that it wouldn't do genocide.  It's like Ramil Safavor knocking on your door.

So morality aside, it's pretty logical why those guys up in the mountains aren't going to capitulate - it's a death sentence.",,/r/europe/comments/jc6thh/time_for_the_world_to_recognize_artsakh_republic/g8zv33k/,adammathias,1602851375

There is a lack of places for patients, even those with life-threatening conditions. The powerlessness of rescuers and ambulance dispatchers and the hopeless situation of Warsaw hospitals in the era of coronavirus - such a picture emerges from the recordings between rescuers and the ambulance centre, which were accessed by the tvn24.pl portal.
The recordings available to the editorial staff of tvn24.pl come from Wednesday 14 October. They record conversations between the dispatcher and crews of individual ambulances of the Voivodship Rescue and Sanitary Transportation Station on duty on that day in Warsaw. The communication is carried out using generally available radio channels.
For a dozen or so days now, we have been informing you that there is a shortage of places for COVID-19 patients in hospitals all over the country. The facilities also stop admitting people with other illnesses. Planned treatments are being suspended and subsequent hospitals are being transformed into facilities for coronavirus-infected patients only. Queues of ambulances are lined up in front of the Hospital Emergency Wards, as documented by TVN Warszawa reporter, among others.
Recordings from the Warsaw ambulance allow us to realise how dramatic the situation in the health care system is becoming.
""Try to get in illegally"".
The first message comes from 3.12 p.m. The ambulance crew asks what to do with the patient. The conversation does not indicate the condition of the person in the ambulance or what is wrong with them. From the context it can be deduced that the rescuers are waiting at the W. Orłowski Hospital in Czerniakowska Street in the Powisle district. The crew of another ambulance joins in the conversation, offering advice to their colleagues: ""If we had a problem with handing over a patient at 'Orłowski', we got into it illegally with transport. Try to squeeze in. Maybe it will work'. Their hopes are being cooled by the dispatcher: ""The transports are still waiting in the morning. Unfortunately, we cannot squeeze it in, because there is no way. There is no way.
After 20 minutes, the ambulance crew asks what to do with the patient. ""We leave and go."" - says the dispatcher. ""But we are to throw him at the door here? Or where? Because they don't want to open the door. The door is closed to the emergency room when you enter,"" they report from the ambulance. The police are involved in the action. The dispatcher expects the officers to force the doctor to accept the patient. This is not the case. ""The doctor at 'Orłowski' will not accept the patient. He refuses to fill in any documents at all and to declare that the patient may stay somewhere in the bushes. I do not know where. In the presence of the police. The police also say that there is nothing they can do about it. What further decision? - asks the paramedic in the ambulance. 
At 3.43 p.m., a dispatcher sends her to Grochowski Hospital on Grenadier Street. The dispatcher regrets that due to the lack of places in the hospitals ""unfortunately we are not able to have teams for patients in need"".
The situation on Grenadiers is repeated. ""They are blocked because COVID is on SOR. Is there in the emergency room. So I am just passing on the information that there is no option for the patient to stay here. - informs the crew. ""No, there is no option. You leave the patient on the Grenadiers. We're not going anywhere else. The fourth hospital that refuses to admit a patient."" - says the dispatcher is clearly upset. Again, the police are called in, but again the intervention ends in nothing. 
More hospitals mean more failures. ""Międzylesie does not want to accept. There is no room."" - are reported by rescuers. ""No one has a seat."" - clearly, someone in the control room is conveying the words. 
At 4.51 p.m. the dispatcher contacts the ambulance again. From the context, it appears that in the meantime, she has been talking to the regional coordinator, who has appointed a place where the patient is to be met. The dispatcher passes the information on to the crew with a clear snack: ""You can't guess which hospital was chosen by the voivode, indicated to receive your patient. Smile and be proud to go to Professor Orłowski Hospital. By the decision of the Mazovian Voivode, the hospital must receive the patient"".
This is the facility where the rescuers rebounded from the door an hour and a half earlier. 
""All right, here we go, let's see. There will probably be quarrels over the next one."" - says one of the rescuers. 
""No quarrels. The governor's decision."" - cuts off the dispatcher. 
This is where the recording ends. We do not know whether the patient was admitted to W. Orlowski Hospital or what happened to him later. 
""They have no staff, they do not accept. They have dug in.""
The next recording starts at 17.06, also on Wednesday. The crew of the ambulance reports that they have a patient with dyspnea, cold and temperature, but with a negative result of the COVID-19 test. The rescuer is to go to the Chernikovsky Hospital at Stępińska He senses problems, so he asks the dispatcher to inform the institution. Without success. At 17.24 the rescuer reports: ""Stêpiñska claims that it is closed, they sent a letter, they have no staff and do not accept. They dug in. The crocodiles are in the moat. And a patient is suffocating. Where should we go?'.
""Patient with dyspnea?"" - asks the dispatcher. 
""Yes, the doctor came to the ambulance, when he listened to the interview, he moved away and said that we should go to Wallachia. So we have nothing to talk about here. Where can I go?"" - the rescuer asks. The Ministry of Internal Affairs hospital in Wallachia is an outpost for people from COVID-19.
""But the patient has no confirmed result and Wallachia is clogged, it will not accept without confirmation of COVID. We leave the patient in Stępińska Street. We leave the patient in Stępińska Street"". - repeats the dispatcher.
""They dug in. The crocodiles are in the moat.""
""The doctor wrote on the card, said categorically 'no'. He won't accept, he won't give a bed and that's it."" - are being explained by the rescuers.
The push continues until 17.44. The dispatcher: ""'Listen to me, I spoke to the coordinator at this moment, who said that he would receive you at the Solec Hospital [in the Powiśle district - ed] this patient. And that the doctor from Stępińska, who went out to that patient, said that it was not true, that he had a saturation of 50 or 60 only 80. I don't know how he did it'.

""Good. He has 46 at the moment. I am going to Solec."" This is the end of the recording. We don't know what happened to the patient.
- A person with a saturation at such a level qualifies for immediate connection under a ventilator - says tvn24.pl the doctor working in a covidovymen ward.
""They die and will keep dying"".
On Wednesday, TOK FM radio informed about the dramatic situation in Czerniakowski Hospital. A group of doctors from the internal medicine ward are planning to leave work, and the Warsaw City Hall has dismissed the management of the facility. There are more COVID-19 patients in the hospital, who have nowhere to be transported. On Tuesday, a dramatic Facebook entry was posted by the head of the Anaesthesiology Ward of the Czerniakowski Hospital, Dr Tomasz Siegel.

""There are no places for patients with COVID-19 in the whole country for a long time. (...) The statistics provided are fictional. The number of ventilators does not matter, what matters is the number of intensive care posts and staff able to treat the most severely ill patients. The intensive care facilities are over. A week ago there was a queue of 12 patients from COVID!"" - wrote Dr. Thomas Siegel.
According to his report, on Friday 9 October, he received an order from the Ministry of Health that he should activate 38 covid places in his hospital. ""Where should I evacuate the patients who are currently occupying these places? Where should I move them? The Minister did not say, he could not, because there are nowhere else to go. Which hospital will take over the area of the last internal ward for non-infected patients from southern Warsaw? He did not write because nobody is able to take over anything if he himself is completely burdened. (...) From the very beginning these orders remain a fiction. They were created to make a press conference and erase the blood of people who are dying before our very eyes and will die for lack of help. - Siegel ends his entry.",Poland,/r/europe/comments/jc8yme/there_are_no_places_no_one_has_a_place_dramatic/g8zvetw/,cheezus171,1602851608

3669,"We definitely are „only a few weeks behind“. We had some tame weeks but since 7 days or so the numbers are spiking, following a pretty visible exponential growth even back into something like August.

I think this mostly stems from weather changing (it got really cold so outside activities like chilling in the garden/park are not really comfy any more, but chilly) and from people just being tired following distancing.

I hope the numbers are a wakeup call and people start to pay more attention, especially regarding private meet-ups and private parties.

I don’t have high hopes that we (Germany) can prevent a more serious lockdown (similar to March). Politicians are reacting to slow and to careful, when numbers started to raise over 1000 three weeks ago would have been the time to react, but everybody played it down.

Testing is one part of the equation, followup and contact quarantine the other. That went well for about up to 1000 cases per day Germany wide, but currently the officials are completely outnumbered by cases, and we will see cascade effects based on people not being informed of official quarantine.

This brought us through summer, and this is what will fail utterly now.

I just hope people understand the seriousness quickly. And yes we have good testing capabilities. But testing does only help if you can do contact follow-up ASAP.",,/r/europe/comments/jc5e4a/daily_new_confirmed_covid19_cases_per_million/g8zmwm5/,daiaomori,1602844342

3686,"Angela Merkel has called on Boris Johnson to keep negotiating over Brexit, saying the EU will need to compromise, ahead of a statement by the prime minister on whether he will walk out of the trade and security talks.

In comments designed to cool the temperature of the troubled talks, the German chancellor said both sides needed to find common ground. Johnson had threatened in September to abandon negotiations if an agreement was not in place by this weekend.

“In some places things have moved well, in other places there is still a lot of work to be done,” Merkel said. “We have asked the United Kingdom to remain open to compromise, so that an agreement can be reached. This of course means that we, too, will need to make compromises.”


Downing Street had reacted in dismay as the French president, Emmanuel Macron, led EU leaders at a summit on Thursday in demanding the UK swallow the bloc’s conditions or face a no-deal exit.

The EU had proposed a further “two to three weeks” of negotiations but the summit communique said it was up to the UK to “make the necessary moves to make an agreement possible”.

Issued on Thursday afternoon, the leaders’ statement had asked the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, to “continue negotiations in the coming weeks”. Barnier said he would be in London on Monday.

However, to the frustration of Downing Street, a call for an “intensification” of talks, included in an earlier draft of the statement, was deleted by the time leaders signed it off.

The UK’s chief negotiator, David Frost, tweeted in response: “Disappointed by the [summit] conclusions on UK/EU negotiations. Surprised EU is no longer committed to working ‘intensively’ to reach a future partnership as agreed with [the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen] on 3 October.


“Also surprised by suggestion that to get an agreement all future moves must come from UK. It’s an unusual approach to conducting a negotiation.”

The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said on Friday morning he had also been “disappointed by the lack of flexibility that seems to have come out of the European council”. But he emphasised that a deal was still possible.

“We’ve been told that it must be the UK that makes all of the compromises in the days ahead, that can’t be right in a negotiation, so we’re surprised by that, but the prime minister will be saying more on this later today,” he said. “Having said that, we are close [to a deal]. With goodwill on both sides we can get there.”

EU officials said they believed Downing Street was seeking to create a moment of political crisis. According to EU sources, the summit statement had been seen by No 10 and there should not have been any surprises.

The change to the original draft had been made ahead of leaders seeing the communique and it was merely done as a call for intensified talks had been made in the last summit conclusions, the source said.


Raab noted in his comments on Friday morning that there had been more “emollient” language from other quarters in Brussels, in a reference to a statement from Barnier in which he promised to “speed up” negotiation.

“We’re available, we shall remain available until the last possible day,” Barnier said. “The negotiations aren’t over – we want to give these negotiations every chance to be successful. I shall say to David Frost we’re prepared to speed up negotiations in the next few days.”

Following the issuing of the summit communique, the leaders had held a two-hour discussion on the most contentious issues that stand in the way of agreement: how to hold both sides to the deal, EU access to British fishing waters and the so-called level playing field demands, sought by Brussels to ensure neither side can undercut standards or over-subsidise parts of the economy to give its companies a competitive advantage.

The heads of state and government were asked to put their phones and tablets into lockers to avoid any leaks during the discussion.


The Irish taoiseach, Micheál Martin, said Barnier had provided a presentation on the most thorny issues remaining.

“Fisheries loomed large in the presentation and in the subsequent debate, and of course a dispute mechanism to have a proper process in terms of how to resolve any subsequent disputes if an agreement was to be arrived at,” he said.

“I think [Barnier] senses that he will continue negotiating until the very end to get a deal, but there are difficulties. I think that it would be fair to say that there are challenges, and particularly on those last three items that I referenced – in terms of level playing field, in terms of fisheries, in terms of governance, that there hasn’t really been sufficient movement on those fronts to at this stage suggest that there could be an agreement, so there’s significant work to be done yet.”",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/jc7hrj/merkel_urges_johnson_not_to_abandon_brexit/g8zn05c/,nmcj1996,1602844444

What is more, any Common Security and Defence Policy mission, whether military or civilian in nature, requires unanimity to be launched. Due to the European Union’s growing internal divisions, the number of such military missions has declined steadily in recent years.",Luxembourg,/r/europe/comments/jc058w/sweden_to_increase_military_spending_by_40_as/g8z9sb0/,JackRogers3,1602829925

Now we have the bosses serving long prison times, but they keep on organizing their businesses from the prison. They have enough money and power to do that.  People still live in fear for them.

They liquidate each other, each other's brothers, each other's girl friends, and lawyers. The burden that they put on the system and the society is just too big.

One does not impulsively earn 500 000 euro, this can be only achieved in full consciousness. The suffering that is created by narcotics trade is so big, that death is justified.

3949,"&gt; No reliable evidence.

Then there's never any 'reliable' evidence about anything in history. 
I can also use the same claim about anything. Since USSR was one of the biggest aggressors in WW2, there is a huge chance it made up most necessary evidence it now uses to defend itself. 

&gt; None of them orchestrated anything. Yeltsin was 8 years old. Khrushev was in Ukraine repressing ""hostile elements"".

I meant they acknoledged this event was orchestrated by USSR side.

&gt; To Finland under radical nationalists? 1917-1944?

Finland wasn't under radical nationalists. (At least no more than for example Russia was). That's historical revisionism attempting to make finland look like it deserved to be invaded.

&gt; But instead you want to glorify some greedy warmongering guys and paint them as victims to ""bad USSR"".

The only big warmonger in Europe other than Hitler, was Stalin, who attacked Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland. There's no doubt here who's the warmonger. Countries of few million people would never attack soviet union and there's no motive for it, while there was plenty of motive for USSR to attack them.

&gt; To learn how these politicians put an eternal shame on your country by making it nazi ally.

(Not my country btw.)

To only reason Finland was a nazi ally was because USSR attacked them first. USSR made them an ally of Nazi.
Obvious choice, in my opinion. It's the same reason other countries had forces which were allied with nazis, to fight against soviet union. People, who were attacked by soviets first, saw Germany as the lesser evil at the time. Especially with Nazi propaganda, which probably promised them freedom if they fought soviets. 

&gt; No it was used as last measure to irrationally brave Finnish parlament, who refused dialog even after being threatened with war.

Which would've been the right to do, to be honest. The Iraq War paved the way for the rise of ISIS, and terrorism in Europe as a result as well. And don't forget the influence ISIS had in the Syrian civil war, which caused a refugee crisis. 

&gt;A behemoth EU army will become useless because it's activation and usage will be complex as you have to get all the EU nations to agree.

4206,"I strongly disagree, his philosophy is completely antithetical to fascism. The only thing they have in common is not jerking around metaphysical other-worldly concepts removed from reality and instead focusing willpower into down-to-earth tangible action, but ever then fascism preaches abnegation and immolation of the self for the sake of an abstract.

The übersmench is not just someone particularly strong in the sense of being capable of physical violence or dominating through sheer might, but rather someone who is intellectually and morally mature enough to grow beyond externally imposed dogmas limiting him. He struggles because he does not conform with the place he has been provided, he questions rather than meekly accepting axiomatic principles, and he replaces taught moral codes with his own values. For a fascist, that's an aberration.

Fascism seeks to replace individuality and critical thought with uniform affiliation to the nation and to the hierarchy, turning people into cogs of a machine and supervising every part does is function coordinately. Fascism permanently requires an *outside* common enemy (real or imaginary) but that's a just a tool to sustain its own structures, on the inside confrontation or dissent aren't allowed because all effort has to serve a purpose that advances the common goal of enhancing the nation's greatness in a way dictated by the leader.",,/r/europe/comments/jblmei/today_we_celebrate_the_birthday_of_nietzsche_one/g8y11tj/,potato_devourer,1602800867

I don't know what you mean with better nature. I'd say that the Alps, Andalusia, .... are more beautiful than anything to be found in central Europe but that's just an opinion, there is no real ranking or score for such things. There is however a ranking/score for the air quality of cities and the best in central Europe is prague with a D-. Cities in Switzerland, Germany and France reach scores up to B+ with cities much larger than their competitors.

There once again is no score on lifestyle. I can however tell you that the life expectancy in western Europe in generally much higher than in central Europe and even Germany. 

My personal experience with public transport is that transport in cities like Dusseldorf, Paris and Amsterdam was much much better than in Prague, Krakow and Gdanks. IES Abroad ranks the quality of public transport with Paris as the best in Europe followed by Munich, Berlin and Amsterdam. 

I can send you the links if you want it's just a bit annoying on mobile.

No, that embargo has not been ""lifted for the navy"". That embargo never applied to any weapons deals which had already been approved when the first restrictions on weapons exports to Turkey were passed in 2016. The most recent version of the embargo only applies to weapons systems that could be deployed to Syria, such as those tanks Erdogan has wanted for a few years, but doesn't get. 

Overall, the Merkel government has approved more weapons exports than previous German governments, even though the bulk of the German population opposes weapons exports. That is bad. But I doubt they could successfully block the exports of those submarine parts even if they wanted to. Delay, yes. Block, no. The main approvals already were granted ten years ago, and revoking those could easily be challenged in court.

And if you have different testing conditions introducing variables between countries (for example, in x country you get tested only for exhibiting symptoms; in y country you get tested regardless of symptoms; in z country, only front-line staff are being tested etc.), the caseloads may not perfectly reflect the prevalence of the virus in the communities in a way which can be used to compare incidence rate. Even the varying speed at which tests are being processed (x country's turn-around time might be days earlier than y country's) would lead to inaccuracies.   
  
So wouldn't different approaches to and rates of testing introduce variables that can't easily be accounted for in international comparisons?

4370,"&gt;Boris Johnson is on Friday expected to try to force Brexit trade talks to a moment of crisis, amid claims in London that Brussels is dragging its feet by insisting that future concessions must come from the British side.

&gt;David Frost, the prime minister’s chief negotiator, said he was “disappointed” with the outcome of a European Council meeting, in spite of the EU committing to continuing with talks next week.

&gt;British officials claimed the “atmospherics were not good” at the summit and that Mr Johnson would make a statement on Friday, in which he will emphasise talk of a “no deal” end to the transition period on January 1.

&gt;Downing Street declined to say whether Mr Johnson would pull out of the talks altogether, and his allies said he was in “no hurry”, suggesting he would take time to assess the EU position.

&gt;But Tory MPs have long speculated that the prime minister would engineer some kind of political “crisis” as a prelude to make concessions to secure a deal.

&gt;Lord Frost referred to Mr Johnson’s statement on September 7 in which he said there needed to be an agreement by the European Council. If none was in place, Mr Johnson said “we should both accept that and move on”.

&gt;However, the downbeat view in Number 10 will be greeted with raised eyebrows by senior figures in both London and Brussels, where there is a growing belief that a deal is within sight.

&gt;Michel Barnier, the EU chief negotiator, on Thursday offered the UK “intensified and accelerated” Brexit talks to try to close a trade deal by early November.

&gt;Speaking after a summit discussion of EU leaders in Brussels, Mr Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, said his team was ready to travel to London on Monday with a view to making the most “of the two to three weeks that remain to us.”

&gt;He held out the prospect that talks could soon enter a more concentrated format — often referred to in Brussels as “the tunnel”, although Mr Barnier said he disliked the term — if landing zones came into view on the remaining sticking points. These are fishing rights, level-playing field conditions for business, and governance arrangements for the future agreement.

&gt;Lord Frost gave a tart response to the EU’s conclusions, saying he had been “surprised” by the suggestion that all future moves needed to come from the UK. “It’s an unusual approach to conducting a negotiation,” he said.

&gt;Lord Frost seized on an EU leaders’ decision to strike from their summit conclusions the wording in earlier drafts that vowed to intensify the negotiating process.

&gt;During his press conference, Mr Barnier made it clear that the EU was eager to pursue such an intensification of talks. He even set out a tentative schedule he hoped to discuss with Mr Frost on Friday, including sessions in Brussels the week after next, after the putative London round.

&gt;The summit was EU leaders’ first in-depth discussion on Brexit this year and came as a mid-October deadline for a deal, outlined by Mr Johnson last month, elapsed.

&gt;While officials have not reported any breakthroughs following talks in recent days, there have been signs of movement on the UK side in the area of state subsidy policies.

&gt;Fishing rights stand as the most difficult obstacle to a deal, as the two sides dig in their heels over the new regime. The EU entered the future-relationship negotiations seeking to “uphold” access to British waters as well as existing catching rights for more than 70 types of fish that swim over the EU-UK maritime border. 

&gt;Arriving at the summit, French president Emmanuel Macron said he was ready to accept a no-deal outcome to Brexit talks if the UK did not shift position, with negotiations still deadlocked.

&gt;However, Mr Macron at least indicated some willingness to negotiate on fish saying that he was looking for “a good compromise” on the issue, while warning that he would not allow the sector to be sacrificed.

&gt;EU leaders in their statement reaffirmed “the Union’s determination to have as close as possible a partnership with the United Kingdom”.

&gt;Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, said any deal must be a fair one, but she stressed that the current effort “is worth it”.",Europe ,/r/europe/comments/jbvtrw/johnson_ready_to_force_brexit_crisis_with_nodeal/g8xoy27/,TirNaNog84,1602794409

&gt; As for buildings, telling me population estimates means nothing.  Mexico  City has more people than NYC or Chicago.  More people in India than  the US. 

Not sure what you are trying to say here. Not only was the population of ancient and medieval China many times that of Europe (this remains true to this day), their economy was much more powerful as well. China remained incredibly rich compared to the rest of the world until colonialism and the industrial revolution eventually allowed European nation-states to bridge the gap and get ahead.

&gt; As for the length of Hadrian’s Wall- function of the geography there, ok? 

The point there is that the Romans deciding to stop at Hadrian's Wall was not a function of geography. There was nothing in the geography of northern Europe that would stop the Romans. Their stopping at the wall or at the Rhine frontier was simply due to a lack of ambition to advance further. They could have pushed up and put the frontier at a different wall or river and actually did at some point (like the Antonine Wall or the Elbe frontier), but eventually came to the conclusion that holding those lands didn't really provide any additional value (just more sparsely populated land with similar barbarians) for their efforts and retreated again. The same is true for the various versions of the Great Wall of China. The point is that empires aren't limited in their expansion by geography, but by ambition. Empires will conquer as long as their rulers and people can muster the ambition to do so.

There is a slight difference between releasing a single person and dropping claims for greek land.

If you drive an animal into a corner it wont have any other alternative but to attack.

It's really not though. 

You would be disappointed how eager 'everyone' is, the US doesn't like the EU and doesn't really take it serious either. Inside the EU discontent has been growing as well. Norway didn't want to join, Switzerland didn't want to join, the UK voted to leave, and there are plenty of other countries that are not eager at all to set it up or maintain it, though are not given the choice, for obvious reasons. When they are given the choice, the outcome is clear. The referenda on the constitution was a good reminder of that.

&gt;Elections need to be free and fair to give a legitimate winner. It can't be ""oh this candidate that we gave 90% still would have got some 55% at least, so it doesn't really matter"".

Where's the edge? What percentage of fakes is acceptable?

&gt;So who says what are the ""correct"" results? The state media? The opposition? Each side will just claim they won and we don't know the truth. Only when you get true results can one be declared a winner of free and fair elections. 

I agree. 

&gt;Of course it does. The government is betraying its nation if it robs them of their vote. The government is supposed to serve the people, never the other way around, and cheating elections is usurping power. In fact, riots are the logical conclusion once you have spat in the face of your people. 

There are laws for implementing a right to protest. Opposition did not followed them.

No, it did not.

As to how it was created:

4750,"&gt; The OP who used what in my opinion is a strawman argument because of the (imo disingenuous, extreme) exaggeration and what in your opinion is a thetorical figure, replied in response to someone who wrote an informative response disproving Kurds are not allowed to speak their own language, which just is false. I'm not saying Turkey is not a backsliding democracy (quite the opposite actually), just that it's unfair to respond with a ""rhetorical figure"" against someone who replied with correct information against a falsehood that is being spread here on Reddit. 

Bit of a run-on sentence, mate, but I think I got the gist of it. Thanks, I understand where you're coming from, I think we're just disagreeing on the minutia (where the devil, as it were, is).

That Kurds are not allowed to speak their own language is indeed false; however, the *is* a qualifier for this, because while it is not technically illegal to speak Kurdish, Kurds are not allowed to be taught Kurdish in public schools. Similarly, there are serious (and not entirely unfounded) concerns about Article 301 of the Turkish penal code (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_301_(Turkish_Penal_Code)) which has been heavily criticized by eg Amnesty International: https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/EUR4413352019ENGLISH.pdf

One of the fears is that Kurds can and will be prosecuted based on that article, solely on the basis of expressing their opinion in Kurdish. If they expressed the same opinion in Turkish, the article wouldn't necessarily apply.

Despite this, they havent jacked up the prices. They're still committed to providing customers with the best prices and value. And overall, despite all the hate it gets, this is a very beneficial thing.

If government created barriers to entry were removed, insulin price would drop to the cost of production plus distribution. If big companies tried to run others out of business, those other companies would simply switch to the production of other drugs. And the second the alleged monopoly company tried to jack up the prices, they would switch to synthesizing insulin.

The answer is less regulation, not more.

If the polio vaccine were being developed today, it would never see the light of day because some people died during early testing. Today there are other drugs that arent available or arent being developed due to insane testing criteria. Because God forbid that a willing participant dies every once in the blue moon, while millions of others are spared utter misery.

We're already on the second wave, and fortunately, now, we have better treatment options and a better understanding of the disease course.

Every death and every sequelae from the infection are the responsibility of the Hubris of Swedish decision makers. With reports everyday of post Covid19 associated disease on a significant portion of the infected population, including youger subjects, its quite surprising that people throw around the economic argument when we're risking to create invalids of a significant portion of the workforce . Also, if you consider the EU26, the picture is quite different than what is espoused in this article, although I have no doubt we're weeks away of the inevitable downturn in infection rates also in the EU. As a final note, where in the EU the excess death has been under control, in the US 1/3 of the excess death during the SARS 2 CoV has been caused by poor access to healthcare, so I'd be wary of using the US for comparison on anything other than the absolute absence of empathy for the vulnerable population.",,/r/europe/comments/jb68of/on_brink_of_disaster_shaken_europe_overtakes_us/g8vc6wx/,humperdrumpf,1602736667

They don't need to convince anyone of anything about socialism in order to win people over on those issues.

And meanwhile, *actual* socialists in the US find themselves having to ally with progressives electorally and rhetorically, since they agree with them on many of the issues, but are forced to listen to progressives jabber on about terms and labels which they clearly don't understand.

So we touched on how Russia and China (and Singapore) are basically authoritarian capitalist countries. Where the economy is capitalist more or less but the social norms, i.e. individual rights and due processes are weak. 

We didn't touch on many of the other countries though, its an american government class. European countries were listed in the same ""quadrant"" of capitalist democracies like the US, but if i had to guess on the list i'd say canada, france and Germany were socialist (in that the government owns factories or means of production and dictates what is made and how its distributed instead of the market dictating these things.)

The second thing is about swinging majorities - a solution to that would be to have three referenda, each a year (or maybe 6 or 9 months) apart from each other, with the question. A majority (or whatever target fraction) of the votes have to accept it each time or it's considered rejected for, say, 5 years (after which it can, but doesn't have to, be reintroduced).

The most important part for me, though, is that the next steps get handled by referenda rather than just by politicians.

At the end of the day socialism and collectivist ownership of the means of production can't work on a National scale with the existence of state protected private property rights.

Social democrats are not this way. They are closer to what you would call a welfare capitalist meaning they seek to create robust stopgaps for low income, middle class or disabled individuals to keep their standard of living at something more reasonable, minimizing financial burdens on these groups wherever reasonable.

Bernie calls himself a democratic socialist either because he doesn't know the difference or he does but thinks the term sounds more appealing to voters even if voters don't know what it actually is.",,/r/europe/comments/jb04nn/the_most_socialist_countries_according_to/g8uoyv9/,huruga,1602721913

5364,"Your definition of an ideology is incorrect.        
         
Your argument is also based on the false premise that I have somewhere claimed that ""someone can not be a socialist but still be a democratic socialist"". Nowhere did I say that.       
         
The reason I'm getting so many comments is because people didn't read this part of my comment:    
       
""There is a difference between one's ideology and what one can accomplish given their electorate and the dominating ideologies of their governing bodies.""               
             
&gt;The statement ""Ideologically he is a democratic socialist"" is simply false. Bernie Sanders has never made a single proclamation about enacting socialist economic model. If you are so annoyed by these responses just edit your post so it says social democrat as that's what he is.          
         
*Your* statement is simply false. Bernie Sanders has, on many occasions: 1) described himself as a *democratic socialist*, and 2) promoted democratic socialist policies. In addition to this, and being pragmatic in a center-right country, he has also supported the idea of adopting many of the *social democratic* policies of Nordic nations. Do you see the difference here? He identifies as democratic socialist, but understands that the U.S. is not yet ready to adopt many democratic socialist policies, so he has opted to promote social democratic policies (and some democratic socialist policies, mind you).             
         
This really isn't that difficult of an idea to grasp. But this argument is trivial anyway as there is considerable overlap between both *ideologies*, and many democratic socialists and social semocrats caucus together because of this.

Whether the Union is good for these regions I couldn't say, and forecasting what they would look like as independent countries is nigh on impossible, as current revenue is not at all reflective of what revenue as an independent state would be.

I was only speaking about the Union from an English point of view, and as the status-quo is now, England has by far the largest financial burden, and if I was English I'd be looking at that and saying 'what's in it for me?'

Other than for historical reasons the Union does nothing to help the average English person. They have no devolved government, English nationalism is a dirty word (and yes I am aware that most English 'Nationalist' groups are racist, I'm just posing the question of why is that the case), and financially they pay out billions upon billions in block grants every year.

Also England quite clearly has very different political goals than the other countries, which personally I would strongly disagree with BTW, but I'm not English so it's none of my business how they want to vote. This means that the Union actually holds them back (again speaking from a certain point of view) from being able to implement their ideas, because they have to deal with the likes of the SNP who oppose their interests at every turn.

No, it shouldn't. Secularism means progress *away* from religious influence over the government, nothing less.

Also, all your little ... opinions that you presented are just so far removed from reality that I honestly have no idea what to respond. It's like trying to have a conversation with someone whose worldview is based on what the little green men coming out of the walls are saying.

I don't know if you're delusional or just indoctrinated. You're not a victim. The UN, for its many flaws, is about as good as we are gonna get.

If you can't even recognize that, well, then I'm not surprised that you keep deflecting, deflecting, deflecting, without offering any substantial input. You just keep regurgitating your irrelevant analysis of the situation of arabs in France, as if that in some way justifies the actions of Turkey: internal displacement of 2 million kurds, the burning of unwanted books, the lynching of kurdish people, illegaly invading a neighboring country.

&gt;Are you really suggesting that?

You bet your ass I am. I've already reasoned for why.

As a side note, for all I care, all religious schools, all churches, all mosques, everything about religion should be separated from public funding. If you want to voluntarily subject yourself to the poison of fairytales in order to hate those who think differently, then by all means do so, but you should not get a single cent of money or a single shred of support from the secularized government.

Healthcare provided by the government? Socialist.    
Taxes on the wealthy? Socialist    
Environmental regulations? Socialist

I'm putting it into quotation marks because your reasoning is far from logical. Not because it's not ""a proper word"".

I am aware of what a strawman argument is. That's not what happened here. It was rhetorical figure to illustrate a point and make an argument based on that point. 

The reason for the play getting cancelled isn't because it ""got political"" but because Turkey is failing semi-democratic state sliding into religious fundamentalism and authoritarianism and this is just another way for the floundering government to assert their power over a minority in order to appeal to their voter base. It's not that Turks are racist, or that this is ""typical Turkish racism"", it's that the Turkish government is actively oppressing a minority -- and this is just one more straw on that haystack.

Your anecdotes about visiting Turkey is neither here nor there, that proves nothing. The systematic oppression of Kurds since the 1960s and the denial of the genocide in Armenia, however, does prove a pattern.

1) Large multinational companies cannot negotiate special tax treatments. That is some kind of reddit myth thats keep on persisting. You are reffering to the ruling regime. A tax ruling is nothing more than asking the tax auhtorities to say: yes the law is applied that way and not that way. The taxbase is not artificially set. It is just a way of making sure, that before investing in the Netherlands, which tax regulations apply for your business case. So quite tax efficient actually. No big surprises after a few years... 

https://www.eumonitor.eu/9353000/1/j9vvik7m1c3gyxp/vh7ej5swx001#:~:text=The%20Code%20of%20Conduct%20Group,of%20information%20on%20those%20measures.

Harmful tax regimes are being discussed in the code of conduct group of the EU. The old Dutch Tax ruling regime was somewhat harmful, since it was not very transparent to other member states, so it had to be altered. Just as various other tax regimes of member states. 

If anything for example Italy is the country where the effective tax rate deviates the most of the statutory tax rate of all OECD countries. Around 5%. So in Italy on average the effective tax rate is 5% lower than, due to tax deductions whatever, the statutory tax rate. In the Netherlands that is about 1%? 

For the link and raport: https://www.oecd.org/tax/beps/corporate-tax-statistics-database.htm

2) ""he Rolling Stones, U2, Boeing, US Steel, Walt Disney, and Johnny Walker, have taxable presence in the Netherlands"". This is due to the fact that the Netherlands does not have a tax on royalty's. Such a tax will be implemented in 2021 to combat tax avoidance. It is not a tax regime designed on purpose. Traditionally the Netherlands just didn't have a withholding tax on royalty's. Combine that with the fact that the Netherlands has an excellent tax treaty network and suddenly the Netherlands is (along with an efficient and competent legal system) a nice place to reside Ip rights. But like I said within a few months that will not be possible anymore.

5593,"I'd argue the Cuba is actually socialist, unlike China.

There is basically zero private property in Cuba. Enterprises are either government-owned, or owned by their workers. This can either be in the form of a cooperative, or in the form of a family owning a small business without any external employees.

Then, there are a few foreign companies that are allowed to operate in Cuba, but they're mostly geographically confined to the densely touristed Varadero.

And then, they have just had an amendmend to their constitution which will allow private companies, but IIRC only for a limited period of time before the amendment has to be re-approved, and with limits for how big those companies can be.

Futhermore, the Cuban government seems to care about its citizens in a way that the Chinese government doesn't. It's a poor country and many people don't have much - but there's nobody who goes hungry, everyone has access to world-class medical care for free, and there's a budding democracy in place. While the national assembly has limits on who is allowed to run (subject to party approval), the local and regional assemblies are very democratic, and all levels have the option of immediate recall if the constituents no longer support their representative. And lastly, various non-governmental citizen's organizations are allowed a lot of influence on the legislative process, meaning that there's a significant grassroots democracy in place, even though the actual elective democracy is lacking on the national level.",Denmark,/r/europe/comments/jb04nn/the_most_socialist_countries_according_to/g8tz7h4/,wasmic,1602707812

Oh, look, the goal posts are moving again.

&gt;I am pretty sure if you made a play praising hitler, it would be banned in germany for instance.  Even the swastikas on video games are banned in germany. Lots of ww2 games are being heavily adjusted for germany.

So now you're comparing the PKK to nazis. Your lack of historical awareness is at the same time astounding and disgusting. Godwin's law in full effect. You do realize you've already lost this argument, right?

**They are banned in Germany because Germany has vowed** ***never*** **to let it happen ever again.** *You know?* The thing? The systematic mass murder of more than six million people? The very same kid of thing that Turkey refuses to even admit they've committed? *Genocide,* dude.

Banning a play in Turkey because it happens to mention PKK without vilifying them as if they are the first iteration of ISIS is *not even in the slightest comparable* to that. The very notion is imbecilic and without any kind of rooting in history.

&gt;Turkey has a much more serious threat than germanys neo-nazis, we cant let any terror propoganda IF its actually terror propoganda.

You are saying that kurdish people wanting recognition of their human rights is worse than literal nazis. Hoo boy, get your head out of your ass for five seconds, might do you some good to breathe actual air for once.

&gt;Authorities have not yet delivered a satisfactory explanation, and that is an actual problem, but if the play was adjusted so much so that its making PKK propoganda, then they should not be able to do that. If its a vague claim, then what the governor did is wrong.

5621,"&gt;The Norman aristocracy did not see themselves as French.

You're right, to an extent. For ideological reasons (the Duke of Normandy trying to gain independence), they liked to stand apart. The whole Northern invader identity and the Norman legal code were part of that. But it's as meaningful as getting pissed on Saint Patrick's day and calling yourself Irish.

The Anglo-Saxons absolutely referred to them as French at the time of the invasion. And now they don't. Again, ideological reasons.

&gt;but there would be no idea of a French identity for another couple of hundred years and calling anyone but the Capets and parts of Ile-de-France French is rather anachronistic

That's nonsense. There was a well established cultural identity at that time across the political borders. Much like England, in fact.

&gt;frankisised

Gallicized.

&gt;And they didn't exactly speak French, they spoke Norman which was a separate dialect

Norman was exactly French, as well as one of the most mainstream dialects of it.

5652,"The leader of Poland's ruling Law and Justice party, Jarosław Kaczyński, has threatened to veto the EU budget and coronavirus recovery package. Brussels, however, reaffirms its conviction that the budget agreement will be passed on time.

In an interview with the right-wing daily „Gazeta Polska Codziennie”, the leader of the ruling Law and Justice party, Jarosław Kaczyński, was asked about the „serious battle with those in the EU who want to impose their values on us, or even subjugate us”. – I will call these actions what they are: what we’re seeing here is an effort to take away our sovereignty, even in the sphere of culture- Kaczyński commented.

Speaking of Poland’s relations with the EU, he drew parallels with the Soviet Union and the Polish People’s Republic. – If you consider the communist model, i.e. the Soviet Union, the existence of private agricultural farms under such a regime was a horrendous idea, and yet they still existed in the Polish People's Republic. The same holds true for the Catholic Church. It continued to exist despite the harassment and brutal persecution by communist authorities. So even under such unfavorable conditions, certain spheres of human freedom, the possibility of choice, had to be defended. Of course, Poland was completely subordinated to Moscow, but it remained somewhat separate nonetheless- he said.

Kaczyński: They want to take away our sovereignty. There will be a veto
Kaczyński further stated that ""today, the EU institutions, all their different officials, some politicians that the Polish people have never even elected, demand that we verify our entire culture, reject everything that is especially important to us, just because"". - There’s no other justification. It’s against the treaties, and it goes against what the Polish Parliament declared in terms of our cultural sovereignty before we joined the EU. There will be no consent for such actions. We will defend our identity, our freedom, and sovereignty at all costs. We will not be terrorized with money. Our answer to such actions will be clear: no- he said.

Asked whether Poland will veto the EU budget, he confirmed. – There will be a veto. If the threats and blackmail continue, we’ll firmly defend Poland’s vital interest. Veto. Non possumus. And this will be our answer to anyone trying to subjugate us. – he declared, adding: I’ll say it again- we're on the right side of history, and those who want to take away our sovereignty based on their own whims are headed for a fall.

Prompt response from Brussels
During the General Affairs Council meeting on Tuesday, Poland’s Minister of European Affairs, Konrad Szymański, refrained from using equally strong words. However, he still declared that Poland does not agree to the „rule of law mechanism” as proposed by the German EU presidency in September.

Responding directly to Kaczyński, the German Christian Democrat and chair of the European People’s Party, Manfred Weber, Tweeted:- Nobody is ""blackmailing"" anybody Mr. Kaczyński. Citizens all over Europe are concerned about rule of law and don't want their taxes to support governments that undermine the independence of the judiciary or the freedom of the media. What are you afraid of?

Kati Piri, the Dutch vice-president of the second-largest center-left club in the European Parliament, announced a tough stance on protecting the rule of law in Poland.

- We cannot continue, neither politically nor financially, to reward Mr. Kaczyński and his acolytes for destroying the Polish democracy. This has nothing to do with ""terrorizing"" or ""imposing” values. The Polish government must guarantee its citizens all fundamental freedoms enshrined in the constitution and in the EU treaties- she explained.

- Polish citizens are EU citizens. The Union will take up all necessary measures and use all available instruments, including the budget and the Reconstruction Fund- Ms. Piri argued.

Michael Roth, the German Minister, pointed out that Kaczyński’s reaction “is nothing new”. -  Even if some member countries sometimes criticize the conditionality mechanism, the heads of states agreed to it during the July EU summit. It’s difficult to imagine the European Parliament will agree to the recovery package if such a measure isn’t guaranteed– he said after the Council meeting on Tuesday.

Even though avoiding a direct polemic with Kaczyński, the European Commissioner for Justice, Didier Reynders, stressed that the rule of law proposal should protect the EU budget against ""generalized deficiencies in the rule of law,"" because the purely anti-corruption aspects will be dealt with by the new European Public Prosecutor's Office (Poland and Hungary have not yet joined this EU institution).

The Monday negotiations between the European Parliament and the German Presidency did not bring much progress on the issue of linking the EU budget to the respect for the rule of law. Yet, in private, high-level European diplomats voice their conviction that the EU will be able to work out a compromise in the coming weeks.",Poland is no longer democracy and nobody cares,/r/europe/comments/jb3zaj/kaczyński_threatens_to_veto_eu_budget_over_the/g8tksjg/,xorrag,1602700504

5657,"On a trip through China last year, I went into a bookstore to get a Chinese book as souvenir. And to my surprise they had Chinese copies of both 1984 and Animal Farm. They were in beautiful print in a high class bookstore. My mind was blown, I did not expect that.

So I did some research as to why these translations even exist. Apparently dystopian works by western authors are no problem according to the Chinese government. But books like these written by Chinese people are censored to high heaven. This is supposedly because the common people in China do not read/trust Western authors, while Chinese authors are fervently read and could influence the masses. So the only ones who read these kinds of books are the highly educated people who already have access to foreign matters like news, books, etc... So it doesn't make sense to censor these books as that might tip of the educated people more than the books themselves.

At least that is what a quick google search told me. It is truly fascinating and kind of sad that thus kind of literature is not enough anymore to warn Chinese citizens about the dangers of totalitarian regimes.

5730,"&gt; At the same time as taking in foreign vocabulary, English hung on to the old Germanic words that had the same meanings. The result is that today English speakers end up with lots of choices when they write or speak. We can decide whether to *wish* for something (if we're feeling Anglo-Saxon) or to *desire* it (if a French mood takes us). Our *clothes* (Anglo-Saxon) can become *attire* (French) if we're being formal. And as we *climb, mount or ascend* (Anglo-Saxon, French and Latin) the social scale, we might swap our *house* (Anglo-Saxon) for a *mansion* (French). If such a building gets destroyed, we could *ask, question* or *interrogate* someone as to whether it happened by *fire, flame* or *conflagration* (Anglo-Saxon, French and Latin).    
Sometimes, even today half a millennium or longer after this process of absorption took place, we show off the richness of our language by using two words of different origins alongside each other. We can say that it's *fit* and *proper* (Anglo-Saxon and French) to have a bit of *peace* and *quiet* (French and Latin) while we draft our last *will* and *testament* (Anglo-Saxon and Latin), otherwise the whole thing will go to *wrack* and *ruin* (Anglo-Saxon and French).

While still bad of course, it's no surprise after centuries of that oppression people fight back and have had immense anger against them, the Haitian revolution is a similar scenario to this for example.

&gt; Where do you think the line should be between “developed” and developing”?

Several factors are considered in distinguishing developed and developing economies.  
   
One of them is human development index. China [fares among the top countries](http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/2019-human-development-index-ranking) in this criteria.  
  
Another one which is given strong consideration is the GNI (Gross National Income) per capita and here, Chine is in the middle bracket of ""upper middle income countries"", ranking alongside countries like Turkey, Bulgaria, Venezuela, Botswana, Kazakhistan, Mauritius, Serbia, Brazil. In my opinion, this is not a criteria that makes a correct assesment of a country's economy when we consider that Kuwait, Qatar and Malta are ranking among high income countries together with US, Canada, Germany, and other advanced economies.  
  
In terms of living standard, China again ranks among the best (among top 15).  
  
Another criteria is how developed a countries industrial base is and here China is among the best in the world right now.  
   
According to [WTO definition of ""developed"" and ""developing"" countries](https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/devel_e/d1who_e.htm): *""There are no WTO definitions of “developed” and “developing” countries. Members announce for themselves whether they are “developed” or “developing” countries. However, other members can challenge the decision of a member to make use of provisions available to developing countries.""*

There's no way Baltics would ever dictate anything in the EU, I talked about a leading position. Besides, I'm not talking about some local feud, but about democracy.

The problem with Germany and France is that they still talk about getting Russia behind the table. I mean, we've been trying that for 25+ years, it's not working. In the end, can you even think at least one, a single developed country that can be considered an ally of Russia. Because I can't. And that says enough about that country, it's in bed with anti-Western dictatorships and it's not intersted in improved relations with Europe, at least not on equal terms. Hence, when things go hot in Belarus, one should *not* contact a country that has no *bona fide* whatsoever, as we know it will not only achieve absolutely nothing, but also further gives Russia a sense of entitlement believing it has some say in its neighbourhood. It shouldn't.

If EU would be more willing to show its teeth, it could openly put itself as a rival power of Russia in Ukraine, Moldova and Belarus and demonstrate vocally that it wants to exclude Russia from European affairs completely, shutting its influence down in every single European country. Russia lost a lot of influence with collapse of USSR, but losing its closest East Slavic nations of Ukraine and Belarus on top of that would be further humiliation and difficult to play down in Moscow. 

What is more, already now we can see how Russia's influence is not that strong in the Caucasus and they are in a poor position in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. Russia is much weaker than it wants others to believe.
