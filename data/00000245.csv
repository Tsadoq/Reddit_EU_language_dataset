46,"I don't understand what you mean about ""trying to deceive people into thinking [...] they mean 'medical abortion'""?

Trying to get a handle on the real numbers, here, I found the government statistics for 2016 abortions at https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/report-on-abortion-statistics-in-england-and-wales-for-2016, and births at https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/livebirths/datasets/birthsummarytables.

Women who live in England and Wales had 185,596 abortions in 2016.

62% of those, i.e.  ~115,000, were ""medical abortions"".

The number of live births was 696,271, plus 3,112 stillbirths equals 699,383 ""babies born"".

So ""babies born"" plus abortions = 884,979 babies that were either aborted or born.

Therefore, 185596/884979 = 0.2097 is the fraction of ""babies are aborted"", which is indeed more than 1 in 5.

So slightly over 1 in 10 babies is aborted medically, and slightly under 1 in 10 babies is aborted surgically, with roughly 8 in 10 babies being born.

Your ""7.8 per 1000"" figure doesn't match any of this, so must be abortions per 1000... women? of certain ages? Which isn't what their sign says. They say 1 in 5 babies. And that figure seems to be correct.

Feel free to make choices for yourself and Grant everybody else the same right.

And arguing that the abortion of a fetus with 0 brain activity (&lt; 12 weeks) equates to the murder of a thinking person is a nonsensical claim.

A religious person might want to believe that some higher being put a soul there upon conception but that's just an opinion. That fictional higher being can sort that out on judgement day.

223,"&gt;Now you're getting down to a ridiculous level. If someone is raped and gets pregnant from that, it clearly wasn't her choice to get pregnant.

That argument is valid, but only for cases of rape \(which account for a small fraction of abortions overall\). 

Would you not agree that, except for cases of rape, the mother is at least partially responsible for her pregnancy? To say otherwise would be ridiculous.

Now, if you don't consider the unborn child to be \(morally\) a distinct person, all that about responsibility doesn't mean anything. But if you do, then the mother does indeed have a duty to continue the pregnancy \(again, exempting rape\). 

So why would you not consider the unborn child a distinct person? It's not part of the mother's body, the science is pretty clear on that\- so the ""it's the mother's body"" argument doesn't work here. The ""clump of cells"" argument is also pretty disingenuous. I'm a clump of cells. You're a clump of cells. Literally everything alive is a clump of cells.

294,"&gt; If the experiment has been done 10 times globally and you have the data from all 10 experiments and you say ""well that's just a sample, I need to examine the entire population""

No, it just means that you should always keep in the back of your head some non-zero chance that your apparent correlation doesn't actually exist. You then have various ways at your disposal to control for that rate. That's true for all statistical inference and it doesn't touch the question of whether or not correlation implies causation.

&gt; If the data from the 10 experiments globally is accepted by you as the entire population then you can have correlation (be it linear or otherwise) with a high statistical significance, but no causality (be it direct or through confounding/hidden variables)

You almost never know the entire population. I think for the PISA tests that compare school systems there was some obscure subregion that had only 500 pupils of the relevant age and decided to test them all instead of doing inference. Anything short of that and you haven't got data on the entire population.

*So the case you describe here is one where non-correlation doesn't imply causality* (which is a bit trivial as an insight frankly)

&gt; If we take the coin-flip example: Two people throw a coin ten times each. Every time both of the coins show the same result. The correlation (as determined by the correlation coefficient) is 1. The significance level is better than 0.1%. There is no causality.

You wouldn't use Pearson coefficients to describe coinflips and your Pearson coefficient also wouldn't show that there is correlation in the population (the infinite possible number of flips).

This is a case where there is very likely causality (and where there would be neither correlation nor causality otherwise). Now, the data cannot tell us what the cause is. It could be an unbalanced coin or it could be that they flip the same result on purpose (some people are quite good at that with some training).",,/r/europe/comments/8d80nf/irish_abortion_referendum_poster_placement/dxlrmsx/,tomvorlostriddle,1524104116

If half of all pregnancies end in miscarriages, the very lowest number you can say is (190406/2) / (696271 +190406) = ~.11.

But that's the VERY LOWEST. In fact, we have to consider that 1. all abortions are for known pregnancies, and 2. abortions take place partway through pregnancy, and miscarriages are [more likely to happen early](https://www.healthline.com/health/pregnancy/miscarriage-rates-by-week#3). 

Their number is perfectly reasonable for a poster. It's certainly not a **LIE**.

336,"&gt;EU is quite in good relations with the US

The fuck it is. 

Americans and Europeans are disagreeing more and more on everything imaginable and the tables are turning where EU citizens now think they're the best at virtually everything (case and point this subreddit). 

You see TTIP being squashed whereas CETA that's virtually identical with the fears Europeans had that'd come from TTIP becoming reality. Canada heavily favours GMO's, we don't deny that. CETA had no transparency during talks, just like TTIP. Business will be able to sue governments. The three major things that Europeans said ""fuck no"" to when the Americans were suggesting a trade yet CETA was welcomed with open arms. 

It had nothing to do with the things I listed above, it had to do with a great deal of fabricated information and a hatred for the US. To say the EU and US are buddies is an extreme exaggeration and if there is a plot by third party states ie Russia / China to divide then I'd say it's working out extremely well. 

It's hard to find a comment section rather on Reddit, YouTube or any platform where it doesn't even mention the US at all yet the US has to be brought up by Europeans  and it's rarely ever positive. 

Japan and South Korea, exact opposite. You see the vast majority of comments highly favourable - that's what allies look like, thats what a good relationship looks like. 

EU is warming up to China far more than it is with the US and you're seeing more and more things ignored that'd otherwise not be tolerated simply due to closer trade relations and less reliance on the US. Euro &gt; Beliefs / Moral High ground. The alliance between the EU and US is dead, as of right now it's merely for defense forces and trade -  nothing more.

352,"&gt; Do you have any evidence anti-semitism is on the rise in the Islamic world ?

I never said it was on the rise, it was always very high.

&gt; Maybe, but I think there is a pretty large Jewish population in Iran. Does that imply Iran is not anti-Semitic ? Or do you only use that argument when it suits you ?

Yes, Iran is the only exception of a place where a decent chunk of Jews actually stayed, but the fact is that 200,000 Persian Jews live in Israel vs. 9,000 Persian Jews who live in Iran, so it's still not that impressive.

&gt; I think every prominent Israeli politicians has been called a Nazi, and plenty worse than Hitler. By fellow Israeli politicians. Also Palestinians are under the longest occupation. Claiming their hatred for Jews is irrational is just insane. If they feel like this without a legitimate reason than I would agree with you.

370,"&gt; I honestly don't understand why people would find abortion as a solution

Because unwanted kids are at a very high risk of not having a happy childhood, potentially to the point of where they will get abused or even killed either by their own overstressed parent/s whose life was ruined, or by foster parents who likewise lack an emotional connection to the child, if the kid gets out of the foster home in time at all. This kind of upbringing in turn risks a predisposition to a life in crime, possibly drug addiction, since they would lack the imprint of social values conveyed by a loving family. Remember: child abuse is often the cause of the parent having been abused themselves, too.

Of course even extreme risks are not a guarantee, but why even take the risk? Regardless of your personal beliefs regarding ""life"", until a certain point already determined by medical science (and which is used to inform abortion policies in countries that allow them), a fetus *is* nothing but a lump of cells whose removal is no different than donating a liver.

I honestly don't understand why people would want to force kids into a world that does not want them. This is not a recipe for happiness, but for a lot of preventable suffering.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/8d80nf/irish_abortion_referendum_poster_placement/dxlimyw/,akashisenpai,1524095094

499,"Look to Lebanon, my friend. Here's what me and my friend think is going to happen:

Israel has been ramping up its Gaza offensive substantially. We believe that this is part of the Israeli strategy to get the Hezbollah to start thinking about moving southwards through Lebanon. If they don't move, more Palestinians die. Meanwhile, Saudi announces that Israel has a right to exist and thus, begins the process of preparing its citizenry towards a future where the Palestinian concern is not for them to worry about. Next, I imagine the Israeli forces will pull back and wait for the anger to build back up. When it does, some terrorist attack will be 'allowed' to happen. This will bring widespread condemnation from the Saudis who will disavow the use of terrorism towards achieving long term political stability. Since, the attack will come from Hezbollah which will now be in Southern Lebanon, Israel can use this as the *casus belli* to go into Lebanon after Hezbollah asking the Lebanese forces to stand down or be considered as aiding the terrorists.

Yes?

&gt;What makes you think succesful worker-cooperatives would allow in new partners, if the partner can't bring with him large economic resources?

What do you think people do NOW? Do you think businesses pay people more than they're worth? Of course not, they pay them the bare minimum they can get away with, and any excess value that THAT worker creates, is profit. The principle behind a cooperatives is that a worker joining from a more steadfast, less lenient position, would earn MORE of that value that they create. The people in the Cooperative want someone to join becaause they want to expand their business to create more value for everybody, but that doesn;t happen if they don't hire more people. In fact, these are just the exact same principles by which ANY business in todays world hires workers. What's the difference?

 A business owner in our current economy doesn't want new workers joining because it takes away from profit margins and into salaries. A cooperative doesn't want people joining because it takes away from profit margins and into salaries. There is no difference. Shitty businesses that don't hire people fade away, and cooperatives that actually hire people and expand, carry on.

&gt;Basically mobility goes down, unemployment becomes permanent, no poor people will be able to compete in the economy and income inequality will become unreal.

You have this literally entirely wrong. The world as it is today has enough money to hire everybody, and give everybody a VERY decent wage. In fact, enough to make everybody middle-class.

585,"The opposition has literally nothing to offer except vague terms arbitrarily thrown around. And in terms of economy or policy, most of them are mostly tested and proven failures of pre-Erdogan era while Kılıçdaroğlu is a tested and proven failure of Erdoğan era. He's lost election after election but he's not even democratic within his own party, he won't allow criticism or make way for new faces to take over; he will instead kick them out of the party.    
    
People who are young or unfamiliar with Turkey (beyond foreign press reporting) have this idea that the opposition would bring more democracy, make better policy, bring more stability to the country or the economy but they can't be far from the truth. Just take the economy. The economy before Erdogan was an era of semi-hyperinflation. Say you'd buy a pack of cigarettes for 8 million liras one day (yes, million), next month it would be 10 million, a month later 12 million. Turkey had no freedoms, I'm not a religious person at all, but girls who are religious and wearing head scarves wouldn't be allowed in universities or allowed to hold public jobs. The TV/Radio watchdog (RTÜK) and university watchdog (YÖK) are actually creations of that era. If internet was as much mainstream in that era as it is now, we would most likely have more restrictions on internet than we now have (which is very minimal, considering)..    
   
Another example to illustrate the character of the current main opposition party:  I've done business with CHP before the referandum and they scammed us with payments. We sent them invoices, letters, made phone calls, talk to powerful people in their party. When we finally told them them that we reserve the right to take them to court, they said ""go ahead, you can't do anything"". They're right, they are protected by party laws. I don't like Erdogan but at least when you do business with AKP or their people, they pay you when you send them invoice. And to me this is more significant and concrete than Ataturk or other irrelevant stuff they're arbitrarily preaching about.
     
I wouldn't trust them with a dollar, let alone the country. The economy is not good right now but I believe it would be even worse with Kılıçdaroğlu and his people.

603,"International trade is conducted in dollars. If Austria sells wine to Turkey, to buy coffee from Brazil, you all conduct your exchanges in dollars. The reason for this system is that oil is based in dollars, which was caused by US establishing this system in the 70-s by directly making large oil producers only sell the resource in dollars. But that's not what your question was, so whatever.

This system provides an artificial demand for dollars. If you want to buy coffee from Brazil, you needs dollars, remember. Dollar itself is just a paper, and has been since the 70-s when the US refused to exchange dollars for gold on demand, something that was stipulated by the Bretton-Woods agreement.

A single country refusing to trade in dollars is a minor problem, but if, say, all of the world's countries were to suddenly switch to euro, the demand for dollars would collapse which would lead to a collapse of it's real value (which in this case is just dollar's exchange rate to other currencies; since much less people need dollars, it's exchange rate would fall), which would most likely decimate the US import-based economy which needs a ""strong"" dollar to continue to exist.

Oh, and I almost forgot. This system is also largerly responsible for how the US has the unique ability to just print money to supplement their budgetary income. Since the world's economy is growing (all things equal, when your country's economy grows the demand for ammount of money in circulation grows at a similar percentage), printing them below a certain threshold would not incur any inflation. And since there are so many dollars circulating in the world, printing a few tens of billions above the threshold won't give you any noticeable inflation either. 

P.S. Also, the US has a poor record of bombing/invading countries that switched/were planning to switch from dollars to other currencies in the international trade. Google it yourself, but be cautious, it may be very redpilling

In an episode of TV4 News, a woman pronounced on the attacks that the US started against the Syrian regime this week. In the feature, TV4 translated the Arabic word ""Amrika"" to ""Russia, Iran and the regime,"" which Free Times was the first to draw attention to.

In the article, a woman had a living in Syrian Douma interviewed and she said, according to TV4, ""The attack didn't get enough effect, so we want to see more. We want them to avenge us. Russia, Iran and the regime must get away from here because they have stolen our country and our land.""

There is also a lot of literature on immigrants not being achieving net contribution here in Sweden, but to each their own. Which brings me back to the experiences of other people. Everyone is affected differently. Have you wondered beyond just the surface correlation of why less educated people vote anti-immigration? Not everyone has been fortunate enough to attend universities and receive high paying jobs. These people who you say have a lack of education are left to fight over low-skilled jobs. When a large wave of immigrants come and in fight for those same jobs it immediately causes friction as it becomes a threat to their ability to support their family and themselves. A lack of education doesn't make a person bad, nor evil, nor hateful. What I believe is a larger problem is a lack of understanding. Everyone has had a different upbringing, different opportunities in life, and for the left to not understand that just because you are thinking about yourself or your family first before people from another nation does not make you a hateful Nazi. Most people just want to live their lives, provide for those closest to them, and leave the world in a better state than when they came.

She would stick out more in Bavaria. A Japanese woman from lets say Nagasaki, who speaks rudimentary German, will stick out less in Berlin, then a fully integrated Japanese Berliner that moves to an Alpine Village in Bavaria. 

&gt; cultural values and norms that are universal in that society.

Let me think, what are the cultural norms that are universal in German society? What are the *Grundwerte*. The three state pillars are Democracy, Socialism and Federalism. For the society. The dignity of a person is not to be injured. The law applies to all persons equally, regardless of their ethnicity, origin, religion, age or sexuality. Person have the freedom of choice as long as it does not interfere others pursuit of happiness (this includes things like where they live and what occupation they fallow, something that was not the case in the DDR). All persons in Germany enjoy the rule of law, and the state demands that all persons follow the rule of law.

&gt;I don't know what you're complaining about really??????????????????????????????????

You are using absurd arguments.

&gt;Germany before he becomes a German? A month? A year? Ten years? Never?

In most cases 8 years.

&gt;And how do we arrive at that number exactly?

Through democracy.

&gt;Why don't you want to answer it? 

Are you asking a counter question to my counter question?

&gt;so how do we determine if someone is trying to make Germany better or worse if not by evaluating it to German cultural values and norms?

We don't. Germany does not have a court that judges the intention of an immigrant and if the subjective goals align with the German cultural values and norms. What kind of crazy Orwellian police state do you think Germany should have to determine if someone has wrongthink? If an individual brakes a written law then, there are judges, prosecution, punishment, executive forces for that.

779,"I'll try to explain what went through my head when I came out vs. after I'd discussed the movie further with my friend.

When I came out, I liked the death they gave Luke. I thought it was kind of cool how he had evolved from a physical fighter to a spiritual / mental fighter with the whole self-projection thing. I also thought there was some Nirvana-esque beauty to the idea that he died while meditating and became one with the force, much like Obi-Wan. I didn't want Luke to die because he got straight up defeated in combat, and what they did works around that nicely. That is the key feeling I had when I exited, probably in part because it's the last thing that happens in the movie. But aside from that, I also liked the idea that they gave space ships fuel. It's cool that they're working with a very relatable, finite resource, and it definitely helped the movie build suspence as the supply ran out.

Afterwards, my friend (who I didn't see the movie with) pointed out a slew of aggravating flaws, which I cannot help but agree with:

All the men are either incredibly incompetent or childishly, foolishly headstrong, while all the women are wise, courageous and strong leaders. Obvious examples are Finn for incredibly incompetent and Poe for foolishly headstrong, while Vice Admiral Holdo displays strong leadership, both Rose and Rey courage, Leia wisdom, etc. This is likely because the current MO in Hollywood is to portray women in power and downplay male leadership. I have no problem with Hollywood's mission to defeat the patriarchy, but the levels Disney takes it to are ridiculous. General Hux is a bumbling idiot, and Finn is so fucking retarded that he completely forgets about his exceptionally important, time-critical mission to secure a code breaker, and thinks he has time to gamble?! Good thing he has wise and kind Rose with him, and while we're at it, let's deliver a thinly veiled message about animal rights in that whole casino subplot. Nevermind that it serves no purpose because they ended up simply getting caught anyway.

Luke's insistence on remaining on that island and his life out there are at odds with the Luke fans remember from the old trilogy. They are simply not in keeping with the character Luke is. Even Mark Hamill stated that. First of all, Luke Skywalker would never attack a student. But secondly, he would definitely not isolate himself to flee failure. It feels like Disney tried to make Luke's isolation pay homage to Yoda's exile. Luke's mannerisms and his initial refusal to teach Rey come across as comically senile, much like Yoda's. But this is not like Yoda on Dagobah - Yoda went into exile because he failed to stop the emperor and had to flee persecution. In The Last Jedi, Luke went into exile because he was ashamed of what Kylo had become under his tutelage. But that's cowardice, and Luke is no coward.

Killing off Snoke disregards the need to properly explain subplots so criminally that really, it should offend even Tommy Wiseau. That whole character is almost an ""Oh, Hi Mark!"" deal. Why did I get invested in his back story, again? Actually, what the fuck IS his back story? Where did he come from? Is he sith? He looks old. Where was he during the Empire? Why didn't Sidious sense his power? So many questions that Disney just clearly did not give a shit about. Also, it seems Snoke's understanding of the force should've been sufficient to take proper precautions against Kylo's mounting animosity. At least enough to not get killed that easily.

Holdo's ship, the Raddus, utterly annihilates several capital ships in the pursuing armada when she jumps through them. Scientists probably should've whipped out that idea of a weapon sooner. They could've put warp drives on an asteroid and just used that as a ram instead. It would've saved them a lotta trouble. Nonetheless, it was a noble sacrifice by Holdo. She did it to secure the survival of the refugees. This was clearly the right move. Unless, of course, it's Finn doing it to sabotage the superlaser siege cannon. Then it's wrong. Good thing he has wise, loving Rose to tell him so.

Disney has, well, Disneyfied all the romantic story arcs of the movie. In the original trilogy, the romance subplot is Leia and Han (and, to some extent, Luke... bold move). In these movies, all participants in romance arcs are teenagers. We don't get anti-hero adults, we get angsty (Kylo) or goofy (Finn) teenagers. Finn is a fool who has to be protected by Rose. Kylo is a goth kid, and now Rey's love must save him from his inner demons. This is Hunger Games / Twilight love, not Star Wars love.

Disney cheapened the path to force mastery. You can be unconsciously force sensitive, and powerfully so, sure. But it requires rigorous training and absolute focus to harness its power and wield it. You have to dedicate your god damn life to it to get any good, whether you're Jedi or Sith. The force does not and should not respond to untrained, chaotic novices like Rey in any kind of coordinated manner, and it should definitely not snap broomsticks into little kids' hands at random.

There is so much more, and I could go on and on and on, especially because I purposefully did not touch upon any of the equally grave flaws that stem from The Force Awakens, because I feel that's a topic on its own. But I stand by my opinion as previously stated: The Last Jedi is an absolutely terrible movie, and it does affect my desire to keep watching Star Wars at least on the big screen.",,/r/europe/comments/8d2fms/latvia_please_explain_this/dxkmjdg/,CHPedersen,1524065907

815,"&gt;whether the Turkish government actually does anything to achieve these claims?

They do. Cyprus Afrin and Manbij are in Misak i milli. In western Thrace we have a lot of Turkish propaganda through the Turkish consulate in Komotini. Also when Ships planes or helicopters go in our eastern islands Turkish Navy/Airforce/Coastguard sais theyre in turkish area and they need to leave and harass them. We ignore them and tell them its Greek area and we force them to leave. These are childish games that lead to accidents that happen a lot lately. Also there is the issue with Turkish Kurdistan and if(when?) they lose land they will try to grab some land elsewhere. These things will likely happen in our time better get ready. As for balkan countries and especially Albania theyre the biggest issue in Europe. Kosovo is considered both Albanian and Serbian land and same goes for FYROM with Albania and Bulgaria. They will escalate at some point.

For Greeks its more of a dream that someday well get them back cause our grandfathers left that area and Constantinople was our Capital for 11 centuries with great meaning to us like Jerusalem is to Jews.

Armenians were fucked up quite hard and Ararat is kind of Holy to them so they will always want that back and indeed try.

So bottomline Greece tries to keep the status quo and current borders in the region while spending a lot for defence. While Turkey tries the opposite by recognising Kovovo, Fyrom as Macedonia, occupying Cyprus and now parts of Syria and also buying oil from ISIS and Iran. Forced Greeks in Turkey to leave in 1955 even though they were protected by Laussanne treaty causing issues over islets and the Greek EEZ and list goes on.

What i dont get is why Turks feel mistreated when Turkey is huge as it is. Erdogan is using that and acting like Hitler asking for more ""space"" and borders of his heart.

837,"&gt;Beginning immediately after the German surrender and continuing for the next two years, the United States pursued a vigorous program to harvest all technological and scientific know-how, as well as all patents in Germany. John Gimbel comes to the conclusion in his book, Science Technology and Reparations: Exploitation and Plunder in Post-war Germany, that the ""intellectual reparations"" taken by the U.S. and the UK amounted to close to 10 billion dollars, equivalent to around 100 billion dollars in 2006.[3][4] (see also Operation Paperclip).

&gt;Operation Paperclip was a secret program of the Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency (JIOA) largely carried out by Special Agents of Army CIC, in which more than 1,600 German scientists, engineers, and technicians, such as Wernher von Braun and his V-2 rocket team, were recruited in post-Nazi Germany and taken to the U.S. for government employment, primarily between 1945 and 1959. Many were former members, and some were former leaders, of the Nazi Party.[1][2]

&gt;In 1947, the Marshall Plan, initially known as the ""European Recovery Program"" was initiated. In the years 1947–1952, some $13 billion of economic and technical assistance—-equivalent to around $140 billion in 2017—were allocated to Western Europe. Despite protests from many beneficiaries, the Marshall Plan, although in the less generous form of loans, was in 1949 extended to also include the newly formed West Germany. In the years 1949–1952, West Germany received loans which totaled $1.45 billion, equivalent to around $14.5 billion in 2006.

&gt;The Marshall Plan was only extended to Western Germany after it was realized the suppression of its economy was holding back the recovery of other European countries and was not the main force behind the Wirtschaftswunder.[11][11][12] Had that been the case, other countries such as the United Kingdom, which received much greater economic assistance than West Germany, should have experienced the same phenomenon. However, often overlooked is the effect of the ""unofficial contributions"" of 150,000 U.S. occupation troops, earning as much as 4 Deutschmark to the dollar. These marks were spent within West Germany to buy food, luxury items, beer and cars, as well as entertaining the locals and for prostitutes.[13] During exercises such numbers of soldiers would swell to over 250,000. Nonetheless, the amount of monetary aid, which was mainly in the form of loans, about $1.4 billion, was greatly overshadowed by the amount the Germans had to pay back as war reparations and by the charges the Allies made on the Germans for the ongoing cost of the occupation, about $2.4 billion per year. In 1953 it was decided that Germany would repay $1.1 billion of the aid it had received. The last repayment was made in June 1971.[12]

&gt;By 1950, the UK and France were finally induced to follow the U.S. lead, and stop the dismantling of German heavy industry.

If they print money, the value decreases and so does the value of the retirement funds, which people don't like in general.

The opposite is also not desired as it removes value from the economy and slows it down.

This is why having your own currency as a reserve currency somewhere is so great: It basically means some other country removes your currency from the open market and just sits on it while you can print the equivalence and inject it into the market. The value stays equal but your country is able to buy goods while another country paid for it.

There is a huge downside to that, if those other countries no longer think your currency is stable enough they might want to cash it out, which can mean a sudden and catastrophic inflation for you.

1035,"&gt; Sooner or later you'll have to understand that in order to so many nations to coexist on a single planet there will be need for respect of the international law.

Which must be written with respect to all nations' needs and interests. Greece never sought to address Turkey's legitimate concerns and adopted the convention wholesale, which _doesn't have a mechanism for resolution for non-parties_. Turkey is following international law when it comes to UNCLOS, by applying the 1954 convention.

&gt; Lol. Bad example. Not even half of the UN countries have signed that.

So there is a number at which a treaty becomes binding for everybody rather than just its parties? Why? I think it's a pretty good example.

&gt; Sources

Really? Even your conscripts openly say that there are tank battalions on the islands and exercises for amphibious landings and the like. There's artillery, heavy AA, armor and the like. Even wikipedia probably lists this stuff. Kos, Chios, Lesbos all have large army units that have been growing since the 60s.

&gt; Let's take a look at the CHP. Historically statist: check, Ultranationalist: check, Chauvist: check, Imperial foreign policy: check, Populist: check, pandering to paramilitary far right groups like the Grey Wolves: check

Wow, talk about stretching it. You could apply half of these to SYRIZA and its roots. Fine.

Historically statist: Historical is irrelevant. Note how you couldn't say statist now.

Ultranationalist: no check. You must have no knowledge of Turkish politics beyond blatant propaganda to believe this.

Chauvist: eyeroll, another label that neither establishes fascism nor is clearly definable

Imperial foreign policy: no check. Even if the claim was genuine, your rocks do not constitute enough value for anything remotely resembling imperialism. CHP defends and defended non-involvement in nearly every conflict Turkey has had in the past 40 years. Including Syria fyi.

Populist: no check and not a qualifier

pandering to paramilitary far right groups like the Grey Wolves: no check, empty rhetoric and the Grey Wolves have long since been pacified.

&gt; Looks pretty damn fascist to me.

&gt; When UK leave many countries will try to make some cuts, let's hope they succeed. 

Just naysaying isn't going to bring you anywhere.

&gt;Export subsidies was dropped indeed, which was change for good (that you somewhat didn't consider in your earlier argument for status quo is always best).

I never made an argument for the status quo for the sake of the status quo. Stop putting words in my mouth.

&gt;That implies that we have data on a real change in policy, that didn't have big effects on production.

While the export subsidies were removed, the budget stayed in the CAP and was used for land management subsidies and other related things.

Furthermore, I don't think that food export should be subsidized since that in no way contributes to our own food security.

&gt;It is simply a lie that production would disappear if we removed CAP.  There are no facts behind this, so if you don't want to give proof the contrary, we won't get forward. 

Prove it yourself then instead of calling me a liar. Why should your claim get precedence over mine?

&gt;EU is not the competent authority for rural development anyway. That is local policy and should be done by the municipality, why does everyone reject the principle of subsidarity?

*The municipality?* Are you living in a third world country where no farm company larger than a village exists, and everyone gets his food from local farms in the same village?

There will always at least be a flow of food from countryside to city.

1137,"I don't know if what would become the Czech republic had a lot of outward migration but that had a massive impact on the Irish language, it was one of the few countries in the world which saw it's population continuously decrease over the century between 1855-1955 which is notable since I'm intentionally excluding the famine years here. If you were born in Ireland in that period you had a very high likelihood that you would leave and die elsewhere, the country was barely a bastion for it's own people and most permanently moved to other English speaking countries like the USA or Britain. As is often the case with these kinds of things economics had a much greater effect than government policy (you could make an argument that, compared to other European countries the British government actually had a lot less institutionalized, deliberate attempts to erase local languages compared to places like Russia, France or Germany, certainly they weren't doing anything to stop the Free State from reversing things after 1922), Ireland did not have the economic strength to really prevent large scale migration and the Irish language was economically useless in most regards, it was worthless in the countries people moved to, and it was of limited use in Ireland itself since the major cities that dominate the economy have historically not been very Irish speaking, especially Dublin. Traditionally Irish speaking areas have been concentrated in the poorest areas of the west, which saw the largest migration. 

My vague understanding is that the Czech lands became very economically important by the end of the 19th century, which was something Ireland did not have.

In addition to all of this serious movements to build Irish national identity around language instead of religion came surprisingly late, the Gaelic League was only established in 1893, although it succeeded some similar societies going back a few decades further.  Irish language revivalism was also surprisingly strongly associated with Protestant intellectuals, instead of the Catholic majority, who understandably wanted to shift Irish nationalism away from based more around the Catholic faith towards less religiously orientated cultural markers like language that they could avail of too. I understand that Czech language revivalism was already a thing at the end of the 18th century.",,/r/europe/comments/8cxnp3/distribution_of_the_irish_language_in_1800/dxk2lvc/,Khwarezm,1524036867

1233,"&gt; In my opinion you should see a country more as a society and not by its culture.


Society and culture are not independent of each other. In order to even have anything that could be considered a society you need a common set of cultural values and norms. That's part of the reason the Middle East and large parts of Africa is such a shit show. Western colonial powers drawing boarders without considering the  different populations' cultures, which completely fucks over any possibility for a cooperative and functioning society. 


&gt;  You don't have to be German to be German.


Yes you do. If you're not a German living in Germany you are a foreigner living in Germany. I'm not saying there's necesserily anything wrong with that, i'm just pointing out the obvious. If I go to Germany for vacation I don't become German for two weeks, and if I move to Germany without adapting to the cultural values and norms of German society i'm not gonna become German. I'm gonna be a foreigner permanently living in Germany.


&gt;  it's not about assimilating all of their standards but it's about accepting their rules and contributing to this society.

&gt; You just have to try to make Germany better than it was before you joined.


""Better"" is subjective, and often implies not respecting the current rules. That's how you change things, for better and worse. For example, Islamic extremists don't want to outlaw homosexuality because they think it makes society worse, they think it would make society better. Right?


So how is it decided what makes society better or worse? What measurement do we use? We use our cultural values and norms.


If someone has a different set of cultural values and norms, how would you cooperate to make Germany better? For example if someone views women as property and think homosexuality should be outlawed... how would you cooperate with such a person to make your country better? He would have to adopt your cultural values and norms, there can be no negotiation on those points. Also known as asmiliation.

&gt;France was in no shape to win a war back then, let alone to properly mobilize. 

NO country was prepared for war. Hitler BET on it. Wehrmacht had problem with capturing Austria, and that was country that joined Germany willingly and collaborated with them. Capturing Czechoslovakian arms and industry was completely vital for Germany later success.

&gt; Now imagine France entering a year earlier, without the UK - achieving nothing but both Czechoslovakia and France being dismantled. 

Entering earlier would force Hitler to back off. Situation on western front would be completely different, since Germany would have to either split forces or try to push one player out of the war. Germany would probably try to kill Czechoslovakia, but the fortification was formidable and while it hold advantage in long run, in the short run Wehrmacht would bleed heavily and possibly stail, before they understood that they have to use a different tactics. This would give time for French to ride into Germany essentially unopposed.

In fact, French had more and better tanks in start of the war. They had them just distributed as support for troops, not as tank division.

Furthermore, if French enter into war, British would be obliged as well and Soviet union as well, since it promised it and it ignored this only because French and British did. Either that, or Poland would try to score war with Germany rather than with Czechoslovakia, as it did historically (and almost failed).

Looking back on the last four generations, none of my ancestors were born and raised in the same country. My great grandfather was born in a country with an emperor. His ""class"" limited what he could be and who he was able to marry. We overcome this era and installed the first German democracy in which my grandfather was born. He was born in the weimaranian republic, which failed and let to one of the most horrible times in human history. A time in which he was raised, with racism, war and death around him. A time we were also able to overcome, grow out of and become better. My parents were born in a parted country, a country of terror and imminent death, with WW3 all over the place. A time, we were able to overcome, we were able to grow on, become better. I was born and raised in a unified country, still very young and in no way perfect. And I'm sure we will overcome this time, become better and learn from our mistakes.

Failure is a part of life. It's nothing to worry about. If you don't fail, you don't get a chance to become better.

* 2) ""Bullying because I'm German"" - includes the desire to change schools without an option for it.
* 3) Bullying because of someone telling on others. Includes teachers who told the victim it's their fault.
* 4) Bullying because of an immigrant background. Includes a teacher piling onto the victim because of their personal beliefs.
* 5) ""Generic"" bullying that resulted in depression and self-harm. Includes parents calling out ineffective procedures and missing money.
* 6) ""Generic"" bullying during which someone didn't speak up to his parents (to not worry them) and teachers who were unable to do anything.

In 1907, when I happened to spend two or three months in Berlin, we Russian Bolsheviks often used to laugh at some of our German friends on account of their respect for the law. There was, for example, a story in circulation about an occasion when the Berlin Social-Democratic Executive fixed a definite day and hour for a demonstration that was to be attended by the members of all the suburban organizations. A group of about 200 from one of the suburbs arrived in the city punctually at the hour appointed, but failed to appear at the demonstration, the reason being that they had waited two hours on the station platform because the ticket collector at the exit had failed to make his appearance and there had been nobody to give their tickets to.

Example: You are a cook. You join a new town. This new town is 100% full of teachers. What do you do? Do you become a teacher too? Naw, you accept their rules but you contribute your skills as a cook to make this society better.

The same goes for muslims, jews, syrians, russians, whoever wants to be part of Germany: I don't care were you're coming from, I don't care what religion you have, what culture you are/were part of, etc. As long as your goal is to make this society better, contributing to this societies goals and as long as you respect and obey this societies rules, you can basically be whoever you want.

Also Americans have a lot of respect for the Greeks: they basically invented democracy and they were the first to write quality incest erotica, which is very popular in our Southern States. Frankly if it came to all out war Americans would almost certainly support ground troops to support Greece, which would essentially necessitate us taking out a ton of their military everywhere they operate, and give the Kurds the opening they need to finally get a state. Israel would almost certainly support Greece as well, and that’s a military you don’t want to fuck with either. I imagine Bulgaria and some Balkan States would see the writing on the wall and commit to Greece immediately as well. 

Frankly Turkey has been holding the strategic importance of the Turkish Straits over our heads for way too long, they get too uppity and they just might lose them, or at least one side of them. Also Turkey’s anti-intellectual bent will either suppress their best and brightest or force them to immigrate. That basically destroys the future of their economy, military and government.

Of course our relationship hasn't been perfect thru ought history though it must be mentioned that during the war you bring up we were essentialy an Ottoman vassal state. Also Muhammad Ali brought a lot of Greeks to Egypt who helped build up buisnesses and banks including one of the largest still in operation, bank of alexandria. But yes our relationship only recently took off after Greek independance and have been stellar since. As a liberal Egyptian myself I can say it is unfortunately our government mirroring our conservative society (only some idiot MPs have proposed the anti-atheist laws but the government hasn't acted upon it). Better the nominaly secular yet conservative Sisi then the Muslim Brotherhood. Anyway despite the domestic politics the ties between Egyptians and Greeks are deep and our mutual energy infrastructure projects alonside Israel and Cyprus will be benefitial to all.

The EU is what shifted the polarity in Europe from national competition to national cooperation. No other geographical region in the world today has the kind of friendly relations that Europe has. Nowhere else has this kind of social integration either. America and Canada maybe but the scale isn't comparable (and culturally they're practically the same compared to the differences between European countries).

To come back to NATO, NATO wasn't enough to ensure France and Germany would stay friendly. That's why the French foreign minister came up with that idea of a coal and steel union that later turned into the EU. Make war impossible for generations, not just while memories of the war are still fresh.

Because, just like you, they'red affected by Italian politics. Whereas with Romania, they aren't affected, they don't live here, and they'd be in trouble if they ever decide to come back.

&gt;...ok, let's say 0,55 € for 1 kg..am I rite? +/- VAT and shit... with 60/75 €cents I buy, here where I'm live, 60 to 80gr of bread...

The quality must be better. We import foreign frozen dough. There was recently an article confirming that Western products are, qualitatively, superior than what they export in the former Iron Curtain.

&gt;my Romanian neighbours[...]work as bricklayer (specialized) and live here in Italy since 10/12 yrs (average salaries 1.5-1.8€ VAT and all the shit included+Italian ""pension points"" that could be ""redeemed"" in the years to come)...both mothers works under the table as cleaning ladies...let's say 500/700€ montly, no VAT and no shit included...all below the radar...so 1.5k+500€ makes 2K€ on theirs bank account (or pocket money...) VAT AND TAXES AND SPEEDING AND SHIT PAYED.

So the numbers would vary between: 

a) €1,500+€500=€2,000 (the lowest)                                        
b) €1,500+€700=€2,200 *&amp;* €1,800+€500=€2,300 (the ”middle ground”)                            
c) €1,800+€700=€2,500 (the highest)

The average static result is €2,250. 

&gt;So, given the change, makes like 9.3K LEU...

The average would be... RON9,3k or RON10,4k.                                     
They don't live in Romania, though.

I understand. The outcome &amp; expectancies are faulty, though.

1509,"Question | Answer
---|---
Where are you from? | Originally from Greece but I currently live in Netherlands. I've also lived in the UK for a couple years.
What languages can you speak fluently? | Greek &amp; English
What is your usual timezone? | CEST
Do you have a PC available that you can use for modding? | Yes, I'm also a software engineer if we need any related work.
Are you willing to use [Slack](https://slack.com) and [Toolbox](https://www.reddit.com/r/toolbox/)? | Sure
Have you had previous experience as a mod inside or outside of reddit? | Yes, I've been a mod for my university's forums but just for a few months.
How would you want to improve /r/europe, if you could? | I think it would be nice if we had better tagging of posts and more AMAs from European personalities. Regarding the AMAs, I think we should focus on bringing not only more politicians but also people from the academia with studies on EU matters.
Why do you think you would be a good addition to the /r/europe mod team? | While, I haven't been commenting in /r/europe threads very actively, I've been following this subreddit for as long as I remember. I'm mentioning this because I think that (a) if I become a mod I'll follow-through with my mod-responsibilities, and (b) given my familiarity with /r/europe, I'll be able to follow good mod-practices. Throughout the years, I've seen first-hand how bad behaviour from mods can burn down a subreddit in the past and I'd like to think that I'd take a very judicious and moderate approach as a mod (no pun intended).
Do you believe in working as a team or mostly working alone? | I believe that this is not a binary choice. It depends on the context. Sometimes it's more useful to work as a team, while sometimes it makes more sense to have a more relaxed cooperation and in some cases it might be better to work alone on a task.
Would you rather use 0400 or 04:00 when meaning 4 am? Why? | Uh... as an engineer all I see with 0400 is the ~~decimal~~ octal representation of 256 :D However, in case this is a serious question, I'd go with 04:00.",,/r/europe/comments/8d02rm/open_mod_applications/dxjegpx/,w3lcome_home,1524007906

1512,"That does not matter, its a culture defined by the Quran. The morals stream through the entire community.

I agree that christianity also has some of the same racist/nationalistic/chosen people bullshit in it. But Jesus was more of a hippie and the religion is over all much less aggressive and imposing.

Most of the middle east is struggling and not thriving.. Because there is ALWAYS a group, trying to follow the Quran strictly, and another group who 'pretends' to be muslim.. But really are not following the Quran or what it REALLY says. This creates an imbalance or constant war, between following progressive humanitarian morals, or following the holy book as it was written.


The Quran is an enemy to any western nation, weather people wake up and admit it or not. It stops integration and seeing others as equals. Without it integration would be a lot easier.

Where are you from? | Germany
What languages can you speak fluently? | German, English
What is your usual timezone? | UTC +1
Do you have a PC available that you can use for modding? | Yes + Notebook for Mobile Usage
Are you willing to use [Slack](https://slack.com) and [Toolbox](https://www.reddit.com/r/toolbox/)? | Yes I am!
Have you had previous experience as a mod inside or outside of reddit? | I used to run a couple of RPG Boards, administrated a full fledged Naruto page (please dont laugh :D) (Content Creation, board administration, rules, Disclaimer and stuff like that) The Naruto page had around 100 Members. 
How would you want to improve /r/europe, if you could? | Try to engage the community more with itself. Organize open debates and events with, for example, AMA's from Europe oriented politicians or political parties.
Why do you think you would be a good addition to the /r/europe mod team? | I have way too much time on my hands at the moment and am nearly 24/7 on Reddit. I know how to be objectiv oriented, can gulp down my bias and accept challenging thoughts and ideas which go against mine. Also I know that when you are a mod you have to interact with the community differently and cannot behave like a normal redditor. The position requires a certain kind of professionalism and I can provide that. Also I know a lot about Graphic Design and can help out in that area of expertise aswell. 
Do you believe in working as a team or mostly working alone? | I think every job has different regulations and requirements. It always depends on the kind of job and I would not want to generalise that. At least to give somewhat of an answer: I like to work alone when I can but prefer to work in a team when I am confronted with stuff I am not knowledgable in. For example as you stated yourself: When to ban, when not to ban, what type of ban and so on is deemed okay for certain kinds of behaviors.
Would you rather use 0400 or 04:00 when meaning 4 am? Why? | I would use 0400 because that way no one can confuse what time is ment. It is the official time used in the Army and most armys around the world so there is some kind of standard to it. I also like the sound of 0400 compared to 04:00.

At that point the situation took a different turn as the Americans realized the stakes became too high and Turkey soon backed off.

Here's the ***opening*** from the website you linked, again:

&gt; Overwhelming percentages of Muslims in many countries want Islamic law (sharia) to be the official law of the land, according to a worldwide survey by the Pew Research Center. But many supporters of sharia say it should apply only to their country’s Muslim population.

&gt;Moreover, Muslims are not equally comfortable with all aspects of sharia: While most favor using religious law in family and property disputes, fewer support the application of severe punishments – such as whippings or cutting off hands – in criminal cases. The survey also shows that Muslims differ widely in how they interpret certain aspects of sharia, including whether divorce and family planning are morally acceptable.

&gt; The survey involved a total of more than 38,000 face-to-face interviews in 80-plus languages.

1757,"&gt; Give me enough time and I'll give you tonnes of videos where people from X country are being racist to people from Y.  

You're saying that racism is everywhere and I agree. 

&gt;  it's nearly always isolated incidents. 

Well, no. Some countries are more racist than others. And one aspect to its definition is the frequency of racist events happening. If I see some statistics claiming that 69&amp;#37; of Polish people don't want non\-whites to live in Poland AND there are events of violence targeting non\-whites, it would be fair for me to conclude that these events and those numbers are correlated.

I lived in Poland for 8 months as a foreigner. My opinions come from first\-hand experiences and only backed by statistics. When I was there I had enough of racist ""jokes"" when I never disrespected anyone or when we were not close enough to engage in a friendly banter. I mean, should I have made ""stealing cars"" jokes whenever I met a Pole? And immediately after? 

 Yet, I have nothing against Poles as a whole nation. I'm glad to have befriended amazingly helpful and welcoming Poles as well but that doesn't change the fact that racism is a problem in Poland. I see many of your countrymen don't want to address the issue and instead beat around the bush by saying stuff like ""we just want to keep our pure Polishness"" or whatever but I call it pure racism. I wish you'd acknowledged it and then intend to change it.

People don't like differences. Children are just more honest about it.

(How many times has a kid called someone fat, without thinking they did anything wrong ? It's a simple fact for them, no reason for it to be wrong)

We all prefer people similar to us from the day we're born. It's a natural reaction. You're more likely to be safer and survive that way.That's why we don't like anybody who is different than us. Children as just more primal about it.

Adults do the same thing albeit in a different way. We look for people who share our opinions and exclude and bully the persons who don't. (ie laugh at them and their beliefs, mock them, would never consider them a friend, whatever, 1000s of examples)

You're doing that very same thing, by mentioning religion here, or morons or bad parents. 

Except now when it's adults we're not really able to speak of some reasons openly about why we dislike some people as it might carry social repercussions.

&gt;  Doubling the capacity of NS 1 could completely alter the delivery pattern of Russian gas imports to the EU

Correct

&gt; The fully operational NS 2 would make Germany the potential recipient of the majority share (70%–80%) of the gas Russia exports to the EU

Correct

&gt; The single gas corridor to Greifswald could replace the Eastern entry points and turn Germany into a major gas hub for the Continent

Correct

&gt; The abundance of directly transported gas would arguably lower the price of the resource for Germany, but it would have a 
detrimental effect for most CEE member states. The Eastern market would face higher prices for gas.

Would it really have a detrimental effect on most CEE member states? Detailed analysis on that is the core of making such a paper valuable.

&gt; However, the ability to redirect most of its supply to Germany would give the Russian Federation potential leverage in future negotiations on bilateral contractual agreements and price setting

This isn't detailed analysis. It just says ""There's potential leverage"". Thanks. Germany says it's negligible, Poland says it's a new Molotov-Ribbentrop pact.

Analysis on this would be the only thing that makes a research paper like this valuable. But it's simply glossed over.

Ultimately it concludes

&gt;  The redirection of most Russian gas to NS 1 and NS 2 would make these countries dependent on the resale of the resource by Germany

Which I believe is the real motivation of Poland. It's not to not become more dependent on Russia (beyond superficial arguments like the ones in this paper I haven't seen detailed analysis that would suggest the Russian leverage against Poland would be increased by having Poland buy it's gas from German hubs instead of from Gazprom).

There's people writing about that quite a lot, mainly opinion pieces, but it's a pretty tricky thing to do rigorous scientific studies on. 

&gt;But it's slightly misleading as it's grouped into ""western"" and ""non-western"" which means chinese (etc) lower the average for muslims in crime and lower the netcost in welfare but at least it's better than having it available and then hiding it because the data is ""racist"".

If you manage to serve despite disliking communal living, you are coping with it. If your ability to serve is notably hindered by communal living then yea, you most probably get a discharge.

&gt;I was talking about punishment for failing to comply, though being forced into an abusive environment can certainly cause lifelong trauma as well.

How does said punishment ruin your life?

Also how is it abusive? Abuse according to Wikipedia is ""improper usage or treatment of an entity, often to unfairly or improperly gain benefit. Abuse can come in many forms, such as: physical or verbal maltreatment, injury, assault, violation, rape, unjust practices, crimes, or other types of aggression.""

Discipline which you do not like is not the same thing as abuse. Just because you feel sad and offended does not mean it is abuse.

That doesn’t make sense considering vertical mobility in Imperial
Russia was a very rigid, formalized process that was governed by
the so called [“rank table”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_Ranks)
layed out by Peter I in the early 18th century. (Through which,
ironically, Lenin’s father got promoted to hereditary nobility.) The system
purportedly added a small element of what in today’s fashion might
be called “meritocracy” when it was first introduced but this
aspect was watered down by Peter’s successors. In the end, the
system exacerbated the societal ossification and was just another
instrument of an oppressive regime.

Our laws are sufficient as it is right now. It's difficult to change individual laws regarding all of these areas rather than improve the laws that restricts how people can join the Swedish society. It's not JUST child marriage. If you are for instance an ISIS fighter you can still be a refugee, so you can still seek protection and unless you've commited crimes against humanity or violated international laws then you get away with it, even though these things are very illegal in Sweden. These things can include FGM, torture, honour killings etc.

&gt; Yeah, but the people in regular refugee camps don't become productive members of society. The goal with the refugees we take in is to give them a new home where they can live a proper life, unlike in the refugee camps where they are just sort of in a limbo. The Syrian civil war for example has been going on for 7 years now, do you really think it would have been better if all the countries instead of taking in refugees just kept them in camps not doing much?

No the goal of taking in refugees is not the same as the goals of an immigrant, you confuse the two. Currently we're only helping the few rich ones who can actually get here, for one. For two they're in limbo because the closest countries can't afford to do much else for them, only a very small part of refugees actually live in camps (and thus are in limbo) and that's because they can't afford anything better.

1890,"&gt; How about more modern conventional method, like little green men that you don't actually know who is invading? What if suddenly large military groups of uncertain origin and authority start popping up? What if the country who is accused of the invasion states they are not doing it and that the forces are renegade forces beyond their control?

Let's be honest, who really thought the 'little green men' in Ukraine were anything but Russian?

You don't move any army that easily without a trace. And even if the aggressor tries to play dumb, you still know they're the ones attacking your territory. In that case, all bets are off and nuclear weapons will be used.

 Again, had this scenario been tried in the cold war, we would not be here today.

&gt; What if technology as advanced to the point nuclear weapons are obsolete and can be deferred?

Look that's really a stretch but I'll bite. If such a technology is attained, the world balance would be entirely changed and we'll then see another arms race. You'd need a lot of resources to develop those and no country hostile to us now or historically has the means to partake in such activities.

1912,"&gt; Applying for asylum doesn't give you the right to cross multiple safe countries illegally.

Actually, it does. In fact, it is, as of today, the _only_ way to actually apply for asylum if your travel documents are not recognized.

&gt; No you cannot, according to International treaties the refugee has to apply for asylum in first safe country. The fact that German government under Merkel ignores it's own laws is another issue.

So, did you sue to the ECJ? That's what we did when our government ignored EU laws. EU gave them a fine. Our government pays that fine year after year while still doing the same thing.

I don't see Germany even receiving a fine for that, so what they do must be actually compatible with EU law.

1922,"&gt;With a population over a Million, Cologne is also home for more than 60,000 Turkish migrants. The Armenian community suspects the city succumbed to pressure by Turkish organizations.

I am reminded of a quote from the author of fahrenheit 451, which provides a rather cynical (although perhaps not inaccurate) view on such a situation;

&gt;“Now let's take up the minorities in our civilisation, shall we? Bigger the population, the more minorities. Don't step on the toes of the dog-lovers, the cat-lovers, doctors, lawyers, merchants, chiefs, Mormons, Baptists, Unitarians, second-generation Chinese, Swedes, Italians, Germans, Texans, Brooklynites, Irishmen, people from Oregon or Mexico.

1960,"&gt; To be honest, I find it pretty ironic how many of the same people who denounce things critical of Brexit “project fear” are also the same people constantly predicting the collapse of the euro. So they don’t have much of a leg to stand on, in the first place. It seems to me that project fear is entirely fine if it suits them.
&gt; 
&gt; 

Not only that is a deranged whataboutism, it's not even remotely true. I read plenty of people in the profession cautioning on  how ""project fear"" predictions were based on motivated reasoning who aren't particularly anti-Euro and were even strongly anti-Brexit.

For example, and this is a a very high-profile one, Paul Krugman was one of those people:

https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/06/30/the-macroeconomics-of-brexit-motivated-reasoning/


And Krugman is a guy who will often allow his prejudice to cloud his judgment, yet even for him what happened was a step too far.

I think laymen constantly miss this point: I have no problem with people who forecast a decline on UK's potential output because of Brexit, even though I disagree with them (because the disagreement is mostly over assumptions and at this point nobody can be sure of being right/wrong - it depends on future public policy choices by the UK). But people who predicted or keep predicting recessions and demand side crisis were and are deeply unserious. They simply put aside pretty much everything we know about economics to create political talking points. I mean, if those people were to be right, then we could burn about 90% of most macroeconomic textboos used in schools today, including Krugman's on trade. 

As for the rest of your ramble, I doubt you could pass an Econ 101 test.

1994,"&gt; Actually, it does. In fact, it is, as of today, the only way to actually apply for asylum if your travel documents are not recognized.

No, you got it confused. By applying for asylum, your legal prosecution for illegally crossing borders is frozen. If you are determined to be a real refugee, your illegal crossing is pardoned. If not, legal penalties will still apply.

&gt; So, did you sue to the ECJ? That's what we did when our government ignored EU laws. EU gave them a fine. Our government pays year after year while doing the same.

Germany IS the EU. Are you truly that naive to believe that you can succeed in suing Germany which basically controls EU? Slovakia and Hungary sued EU over migrant quotas, and the case was instantly dismissed.

&gt; Literally a concentration camp for illegal immigrants, where they are tortured until they give out the name of the country they should be ejected into.

There's nothing wrong, with putting illegals into concentration camps, basically every country has such facilities for migrants. If they have been convicted by court, for torture that is bad. But it shows another issue with illegal migrants, it's nearly impossible to deport them.

2008,"To be honest, I find it pretty ironic how many of the same people who denounce things critical of Brexit “project fear” are also the same people constantly predicting the collapse of the euro. So they don’t have much of a leg to stand on, in the first place. It seems to me that project fear is entirely fine if it suits them. 

 They weren’t wrong those predictions were largely about post Brexit scenario and even the ones that were, were based on the assumption that article 50 would be triggered asp. There is an overwhelming consensus that Brexit will negatively impact the economy and that doesn’t disprove that just because there has been some positive news before it happens doesn’t disproves that it would. The UK has also been lagging behind much of Europe for most of the post referendum time so it is not like there hasn’t been no impact whatsoever. 

Just by the fact that leaving the EU means putting barriers between you and one of the largest markets means that there is going to be some impact. It also likely means divergence in certain standards, meaning that companies have to deal with different regulations in order to sell their products in those markets. In order to get a trade deal with those countries outside the EU would most likely make it so. It is also not inter single market trade that would be impacted as many companies set up busines in the UK because of easy access to the rest of Europe. That promise is why Japanese car companies opened factories in the to begin with. 

With the average figure for a comprehensive trade deal being around 5% loss in GDP. That doesn’t mean that you cannot find token pro Brexit economist but these people use pretty questionable methods in order to get their figures. One of the ways is to assume that they can remove all the regulations and trade that way. When countries aren’t going to agree with that, to begin with.

Of course only time will turely tell the real impact of it but it is not looking good and don’t assume just because things look good now doesn’t mean that those negative assessments are wrong. Just because there are times when the UK is doing comparably well doesn’t mean that it wouldn’t have been consideredly better off if it had remained.

2066,"&gt;So we should cultivate rice in Europe?

No, we can always swap food for food even under a constrained supply, as long as we have our own trading chips (literally, heh).

&gt;Or what is your point? The chance we will have a problem to feed our populations in a free market is zero. We would only import things we can't produce more efficiently, and maybe rice prices would increase if something bad happened in a country. However food security is not a problem, we could simply switch to potatos. Europe has great soil and climate for food production. 

But that's the whole point: in a free market, you'd get a countryside that would drain empty, leaving the land uncultivated, and a lot of suburbs constructed near the cities, on former farmland. So that would mean in both cases that that land *wouldn't* be available to switch quickly to potatoes if need be (because covered with concrete or forests), nor that we would have the machinery ready to cultivate it.",Limburg,/r/europe/comments/8cpshs/up_to_25_of_english_farms_could_go_bankrupt_after/dxibjf5/,silverionmox,1523972398

&gt; Those who accept only a transcendental theology [i.e., knowledge of God based on the theoretical standpoint] are called deists; those who also admit a natural theology [i.e., knowledge of God based on the practical or judicial standpoints] are called theists' 

Deists, then, are those who, after reflecting logically and/or transcendentally on the concept of God, come up with a positive answer to the question of His existence. Theists are open to these two perspectives, but regard them as only secondary to the more basic use of empirical and/or hypothetical perspectives in developing a theoretical affirmation of God.   
Only from the latter two perspectives can God be regarded not just as 
&gt; 'an original being or supreme cause' (as in deism),   

but also as 
&gt; 'a supreme being who through understanding and freedom is the Author of all things'.    

Thus, Kant asserts 
&gt; 'that the deist believes in a God, the theist in a living God'

2118,"&gt; it seems to me over the last few years that Azerbaijan's relations have been better with the EU then Armenia

I don't know if you know this or not, but Armenia's recently signed the Comprehensive and Enhanced Partnership Agreement with the EU, an agreement that is basically an Association Agreement, something needed for a Euro country to become part of the EU, without the free trade aspect of it due to being forced to be part of the EAEU. The agreement will be ratified by this year, and will begin being implemented by even June of this year. Azerbaijan, on the other hand, is still stuck with a much more inferior agreement signed back in 1990, and the new agreement they're trying to come up with will both take many years to come to completion, and will also be inferior to the Armenian one, simply because they don't have the desire to integrate into the EU-zone. They wish to be in their own sphere, preferably with Turkey backing them up, a country that, although officially backed by NATO, does not have their actions sponsored by them, and is further distancing itself from that organization with each and every passing moment.

Any and all PR relations Azerbaijan acquires is received due to their oil money, whereas the Armenian one is more backed by genuine political will and empathetic desire.",Armenia,/r/europe/comments/8cn2a2/protests_in_armenia_megathread/dxi5trq/,Nemo_of_the_People,1523964806

Thanks for proving my point.

&gt;How is that NOT comparable to millitary service besides ""waaa I don't like millitary service""?

You get to choose where, when and for whom to work. You choose a career that fits your interests. You can quit a job if you don't like it and you can live off your savings. In the army, you get ordered around like a dog with no recourse, no freedom of movement, no option to quit if you don't like the work or coworkers, essentially you're a slave bound to a place and employer for a certain length of time and that employer can ruin your life if you don't comply. And you didn't choose any of it. You weren't asked and you may not be suitable for the work, it was simply forced on you.

Now, what Austria does with offering the option for civil service looks a lot better since you get more choice and you're actually contributing to something, unlike compulsory military service when there is no realistic prospect of a defensive war.

also:

*A straw man is a common form of argument and is an informal fallacy based on giving the impression of refuting an opponent's argument, while actually refuting an argument that was not presented by that opponent.*

my point was that correlation ≠ causation, in this particular matter that human rights and democratic standards are not the main reason of western wages compared to central/eastern wages

you're ignoring history and democracy development (it's been roughly 20 years not including 90s which were a mess in Slovakia) and expecting countries to be on the same level west is in less than a generation

shifts in society and politics do not happen overnight, it's a rough process during difficult times

also, why do you put government and population in the same bag? do you think everyone in CE/EE is backwards thinking, authoritarian supporting ungrateful leecher? have you ever visited any of those countries? don't you realize majority of population are normal human beings strongly supporting democratic institutions, opposing to corruption, etc.?

2188,"&gt; But in Catalonia all the signboards and signs, shops, bars, advertising, etc ... are in Catalan by law, and not in Spanish. In France, French is the only official language, and its policy towards other minority languages is much more restrictive than Spain.

So France is much more restrictive, while you're explaining without blinking that literally everything has to be in Catalan in Catalonia. Sounds pretty restrictive to me but hey, what do I know.

&gt; So, Spain has an undemocratic policys against catalonia, but Catalonia have a lot more language liberty and autonomy than France or any other European autonomy.

2212,"I don’t know these indexes but it’s also irrelevant, we both know that there are so many factors which can be counted into softpower that it’s hard to have a coherent stat on it.

Edit: it seems you guys think [Soft Power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_power) is a solid stat, but in reality it’s very complicated, if not impossible, to get solid numbers as soft power consists of:

&gt; Soft power is the ability to attract and co-opt, rather than by coercion (hard power), which is using force or giving money as a means of persuasion. Soft power is the ability to shape the preferences of others through appeal and attraction. A defining feature of soft power is that it is noncoercive; __the currency of soft power is culture, political values, and foreign policies. Recently, the term has also been used in changing and influencing social and public opinion through relatively less transparent channels and lobbying through powerful political and non-political organizations.__

So let me ask y’all downvoters: how in hell do you even codify the Impact cultures have? There isn’t a formula or anything. 

That’s why I’m saying that these indexes aren’t coherent or comparable, because every Think Tank will have a different approach to it.

The only thing all agree upon is a form of Clausewitz‘s definition of peace (everything that is not war is peace): everything that’s not hard power can be soft power.",,/r/europe/comments/8cu9q6/saw_this_on_rdankmemes_and_thought_id_share_it/dxi2fup/,mu_aa,1523957540

Well, yes. 

That's the reason why the USSR constantly lagged behind even though many great advances came from there. It's hard to do science while being paid like some janitor in the US with comparable living standards, if not worse. Double as hard to do rocket science when you get turned into a slave scientist by made up charges with your family taken hostage and you yourself getting tortured by the scum of the earth.
If the USSR wasn't a cannibalistic shithole, perhaps we would have jumped several decades of tech into the future. Oh well, the USSR was never about the tech or science.

It was about the central planning of everything by the absolute central authority, who happened to be bomber terrorists from early XX century and behaved accordingly.

&gt; it had nothing to do with RF but rather some kind of mafia?

As if it were separate things.

&gt; It would only means that RF is so weak that cannot preserve its valuable assets regardless of it's posture.

Currently the only valuable assets are oil, gas and the nuke pile preventing others from taking oil and gas. Other things, ~145 million units of human capital in the RF included, are not really valued, hence the piece of news you can see here.

2358,"Nope, not true. The Netherlands is the second largest foreign investor in the US and to economies like Brazil and China the Netherlands is actually more relevant than the German economy. Rotterdam harbor is the direct lifeline of the German industry area the Ruhr and the Netherlands and Germanies economy are extremely dependent on each other. 

The Netherlands is also soon to be the 4th economy of the EU, not irrelevant at all, unlike little bankrupt hellas. But alas, as we all know Hellas will continue to sell itself to the Chinese as they already do now. 

Its rather pathetic to claim that the Germans vallue their relations with countries like Spain and Hellas more than with countries like Austria and the Netherlands. We are all Germanic people, our languages are nearly the same and our cultures have so much more in common that a German among Dutch people wouldnt even be noticed by a Greek. Much like how you can put a Macedonian or Bulgarian among Greeks and i wouldnt notice. 

We are just different. And thats not wrong, one is not better than the other, but its childish and foolish to just ignore the difference and keep pushing your federalist agendas. We do not hold the same level of tolerance towards each other as we do to people with the same or a similiar language, culture and society.

Just think about how your countrymen responded when their pension age was finally raised to northern European standards. You guys were burning down your own capital. If you ask me you guys dont have to work till the same age as us. Your society vallues wealth and business success less than we do. Again, thats not a case of ''better'' and ''worse'', you guys vallue other things more than we do. Those are cultural differences. If a Greek is satisfied with the luxeries and wealth it can obtain by having a pension age of like 54 then be my guest. Stop working at 54. I dont look down upon it. Its cultural differences. In the Netherlands we stopped working at 65 for decades and it became 67 during the crisis and its going up over 70 soon. Those are our standards. We dont hold the right to push our cultural standards on you guys. Because you guys are **different** than us.

The Germans, Scandinivians, Austrians, Dutch, Flemish are all Germanic. You can see the resamblance very well in our cultures. You can literally see the cultural difference within a country like Belgium where they share their country with Walloons. You literally see it within a single state how much of a difference it is. Belgium has existed for what? 150 years now? And still they have a very hard time having a functioning federal government with 2 different cultures within the same state. Yet EU federalists think they can combine more than 20 cultures in a much, much shorter time spam.

2403,"&gt;I don't believe integration is the primary goal of refuge. That's more a policy situation for each nations immigration regime . Refugees generally are temporarily displaced, like the Hungarians and Iraqis I mentioned before. 

Most of them are no refugees. They were no controls in place at the boarders, remember? Everyone was able to come. 

&gt;If there was a Syrian peace agreement in place many refugees would probably want to go home, as the Hungarians and Iraqis did before to rebuild their lives. 

Here the numbers for Austria: in 2016 more Asylum seekers came from Afghanistan (11500) than from Syria (8730). 

In 2015 there were 85.505 asylum seekers. In 2016 there were 39.860. (in a country of 8 Million, roughly 1% of the population in those two years alone.)

Yes legit refugees should leave their host country to return to their home countries. Immigrants don't and they can't be deported as they have no papers, their home countries refuse to take them back.

Austria had got a vast Scandinavian style welfare system and large migrant communities. Those people see themselves as migrants. Why should they return? They don't. We already see that with declined refugees. They just don't cooperate. They stay. 

Ireland had other experiences. You also had economic difficulties, not much welfare for the unemployed. I guess most of your refugeesare identified with papers and are real refugees, who fled from war.

There were Germans that were part of the Roman Empire and had nothing to do with the ancient Romans as in the Roman people (not Roman citizens). It's a common thing in multinational empires. In the Ottoman Empire, Greeks were technically Ottoman citizens but they weren't actually Ottomans in race/blood/heritage/roots etc. The Ottoman Empire included lots of different nationalities regardless of the fact that they were Ottoman citizens in paper. 

Everyone keeps telling you that in that particular Empire, Greeks identified as Romans for others reasons related to religion, not heritage. ""Hellenes"" had come to mean ""pagans"". The Greeks that were christians though, had taken the name ""Romans"" not because they weren't Greeks but because of that separation. They'd tell you they're Romans to make that distinction, not because they didn't know they were Greek. There were many Greeks living in the Empire, they didn't just vanish in thin air.

2457,"&gt; Was this around during the time of Frederick the Great?

No. It wasn’t even built back then. What you see is the third iteration of castles on this hill, constructed by romanticist far relations of the Prussian in 1850–1867 (yes, that friggin quick). It was Frederick IV who took the initiative following an idealized misunderstanding of his family’s and central Europe’s medieval past similar to [Ludwig II in Bavaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuschwanstein_Castle). (They never get it right, of course: One of the early Hohenzollern dukes was ~~just another aristocrat~~ a robber baron who was so reviled that his subjects revolted and burned down the first castle in the 1400s.)

The present castle was planned from the beginning to serve quasi-museal functions. Apart from the incorporated walls from earlier epochs, no part of it was designed for war. Hilltop castles in the middle of nowhere had long lost their strategic function in those days. It’s kind of a show case for family history which to some extent overlapped with that of central Europe, no doubt. 

Frederick IV died while the construction still wasn’t completed. His successor, the subsequent Emperor Wilhelm I, actually *loathed* the jumble of architecture and barely ever spent time there. Instead, he had his own reconstruction thing going on with [Königsburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C3%A2teau_du_Haut-K%C5%93nigsbourg).[*]  
Frederick the Great of course never stepped foot in this part of the world.

*In fact, Wilhelm even tried to bring in a famous architect from Bavaria who left on the spot, declaring the new Hohenzollern castle to be unsalvageable.",Laurasia,/r/europe/comments/8cphjk/castle_of_hohenzollern_germany/dxhwott/,the_gnarts,1523944880
2458,"He has a point and I'd say completely dismissing it like you're doing is a lot more idiotic than the point he's making.

Human evolution doesn't work any different from other animals and we've seen during various domestication processes that you can achieve significant behavioral changes in just a handful of generations, sometimes even in just one or two generations. [A species of birds on the Galapagos islands was recently classified into a separate subspecies after behavioral changes in the population led to a split that prevented interbreeding](https://www.sciencealert.com/darwin-s-finches-evolve-into-new-species-in-real-time-two-generations-galapagos). With the [domestication of foxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domesticated_red_fox) we've seen that targeted breeding can result in noticeable changes in behavior in just a few generations, with full domestication achieved after 10 generations.

In a similar sense, WW2 acted as a great filter in which a significant percentage of the more aggressive parts of Europe's populations were removed from the gene pool. That certainly had its effect if you look at Europe's population as a whole.

But of course acknowledging this would imply that certain physical realities are indeed a thing, like evolution having effects on the brain, on behavior, on intelligence, that racial averages exist, that race isn't just a social construct and such, so of course the mental midgets here will just ridicule it as it doesn't fit their view of the world.",,/r/europe/comments/8ctmt0/why_germany_didnt_join_the_syria_strikes/dxhwoyf/,TechnicalPianist,1523944886

2464,"Why is the ability to vote on every single matter that most people are completely agnostic about the highest value of human existence? Here is just a few issues with it.

The modern sense of liberal democracy says that we can vote about everything with a supermajority, and that we can restrict the state with a supermajority. That implies we can make long term planning. If all your wealth might be taken away from you next year, why work? If the state-owned media might disappear in one year, all the competent people will seek a safer job right now. Stability is one of the most important things for people and you can't set up incentives for the state nor free market without it.

What about freedom? If you want to build a new app? Do we really have to vote on all the decisions you make? You wouldn't even be able to start. Most likely you would be assigned a job, that you most likely will hate.

What about freedom of information? If the state owns everything, and we are supposed to vote on it, how will we keep the citizens informed? The same problem will happen in a democratic university and other schools. In a modern university, every professor have high personal freedom and can tell the administration to fuck off on most issues. The free flow of information would disappear. 

What about freedom of religion and political leanings? You have just outlawed the mainstream political opinion. The property of every religion will be seized, there is no way where independent persons can give you advice on how to live your life and what to vote for.

With all these issues, what is stopping a strong man from taking control out of the fear, misinformation or desperation of the people?

2590,"&gt; a little condescending towards actual slaves in the new world

Also, WTF do you mean by that? They had is as bad as any slaves in the new world by that time. If anything, you're trying to white-wash the horrors of colonial Sweden by comparing to something else that came later. It's like saying it'd be condescending towards Jews to mention any forced labor in history except the treatment of Jewish slave labor in Nazi Germany World War II era camps.

Every ""[indentured laborer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indentured_servitude)"" (a form of slavery that's not hereditary) shipped there were in practice a slave, whether from Africa or Europe. Europeans were typically convicts, but also ""unwanted"" ethnicities from European colonies, like [Irish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_indentured_servants) or [Finnish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Sweden), which were motivated by racism; condemned by being a certain ethnicity. Most of the British condemned at least got the choice between death by hanging and forced labor, latter often meant being worked to death in poor conditions. Many chose death by hanging. The usual depictions of African American slaves is from an era 100-200 years later; mid-late 1700s to mid 1800s. The hereditary slaves that were established later at least were valuable property, so they were often treated better. The difference between indentured labor and other forms of slavery is in many cases splitting hairs.

Slavery (hereditary, property, no slave-owner contract) in North America didn't begin until the end of New Sweden, so the fate of the Finns were among the worst in their time:

&gt; In 1654, John Casor, a black indentured servant in colonial Virginia, was the first man to be declared a slave in a civil case. He had claimed to an officer that his master, Anthony Johnson, himself a free black, had held him past his indenture term. A neighbor, Robert Parker told Johnson that if he did not release Casor, Parker would testify in court to this fact. Under local laws, Johnson was at risk for losing some of his headright lands for violating the terms of indenture. Under duress, Johnson freed Casor. Casor entered into a seven years' indenture with Parker. Feeling cheated, Johnson sued Parker to repossess Casor. A Northampton County, Virginia court ruled for Johnson, declaring that Parker illegally was detaining Casor from his rightful master who legally held him ""for the duration of his life"". ^[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States#cite_note-17)

Later, in 1662, slavery was made hereditary by the mother's status, because slave-owners liked to literally fuck their slaves and didn't think of the consequences:

&gt; In 1662 the Virginia royal colony approved a law adopting the principle of partus sequitur ventrem (called partus, for short), stating that any children born in the colony would take the status of the mother. A child of an enslaved mother would be born into slavery, regardless if the father were a freeborn Englishman or Christian. This was a reversal of common law practice in England, which ruled that children of English subjects took the status of the father. The change institutionalized the skewed power relationships between slaveowners and slave women, freed the white men from the legal responsibility to acknowledge or financially support their mixed-race children, and somewhat confined the open scandal of mixed-race children and miscegenation to within the slave quarters.

2635,"That certainly is the case, and in that sense, a hypothetical referendum could have been beneficiary for all of Montenegro, as it would have laid that question to rest once and for all, a lot sooner.

Instead of it, due to DPS having the parliamentary support to pass it at any time, they completely abandoned the pro-NATO campaign, which in turn gave rise to the half-truths, lies and even outrageous lies spread by parts of the opposition, spearheaded by DF.

Examples of this were the false claims that NATO is planing to build bases in Montenegro, a substantial increase in government expenditure, actually going so far as to cite the military budget we would have regardless as the cause of it, etc. , in addition to the bleeding hearts populism guised under the ""won't somebody think of the children"" type of bullshit.

Had there been a referendum, there would have been a proper pro-NATO campaign that would have educated people about NATO, and all the benefits that come with the membership. Doing so would attract enough support of the ~20% that haven't decided, thus allowing the referendum to safely pass. Instead of that, they kept on spouting meaningless, bullshit phrases, which is why there's still a ~40/40/20 divide on the matter.

In any case, allowing such, easily dispellable bullshit to persist rightfully leads one to believe that the reason for it is because it's beneficial to DPS. Say what you will about Milo, but as /u/apartid said, when it comes to politics, his skill is unmatched.

Still, as time keeps passing by, this matter will be laid to rest. It may take a couple of years more, but it's an unstoppable process that's already well underway. With each passing day, the question of NATO membership is becoming less relevant, with the focus slowly switching to economic issues. 

Deep down, the average voter understands this, but sadly the same can't be said for a lot of our opposition, which is why there are more and more people abstaining from voting. So long as all the opposition offers is populism and ""Milo thief"" rhetoric, they will not win. But you already know that, as the situation in Serbia is eerily similar in these regards.

2662,"&gt; “These men had nothing to lose, and I could imagine the most desperate among them prepared to lash out in an unpredictable and even murderous manner,” Ahmed writes in “Journey Into Europe,” the latest installment of his series on Muslims around the world. “This, I felt, was Europe’s ticking time bomb.” 

Ya, because all the Eastern Europeans who live in similar situations have all gone and started bombing people. What is this shit? Don't treat us well or we are gonna bomb and kill you?

&gt; Many patterns of discrimination, Ahmed notes, are rooted in colonial legacies that vary by country; in his assessment, Pakistanis in Britain are better integrated than, say, French citizens of Algerian and Moroccan descent. 

I think some Brits on here would differ.

&gt; But even absent empire, many of the Muslims he speaks to find it hard, if not impossible, to fit in. “In Denmark they strangle you slowly, slowly,” one interviewee proclaims.


What? Doing what? Because they don't suck your cock?

&gt; Ahmed also documents how Muslim communities end up reinforcing negative stereotypes. Refugees bring with them sectarian and ethnic rivalries that make little sense in Europe.

So who's fault is that?

&gt; Ahmed spends little time analyzing the role of economics in promulgating these xenophobic sentiments. Nor does he compare Muslims’ fates with the predicament of other migrants — Polish workers in England were, after all, a major target of Brexiteers — or the situation of Christians in the Middle East. 

Thank you for pointing this out. Like why don't these people explain why Eastern Europeans are not causing so much trouble as other certain groups.

&gt; The book’s most interesting observations don’t concern Muslims, though, but the white Europeans who are struggling to reconcile the presence of these perceived outsiders with their idea of who they themselves are. 

No. You aren't gonna do this pseudoscience bs that we are just all confused.

&gt; He hopes Europeans can form new, hybrid identities that broaden the criteria for who belongs.

How about Muslims do that as well then we can talk. 

&gt; Europe happens to have a homegrown example of this philosophy in medieval Andalusia

""Non-Muslim groups in the Umayyad Caliphate, which included Christians, Jews, Zoroastrians, and pagan Berbers, were called dhimmis.

They become increasingly arrogant, so people got tired but they still didn't see any alternative. But, in 2013, Donald Tusk(leader of Civic Platform) left Poland to become a leader of European Commision. Without him, they started to fight between each other, and PiS ceased the occasion. They hide their most radical politicians like Kaczynski and put new young moderate guys as candidates for president and PM, additionaly they promised that they are going to increase social spendings GREATLY. Hysteria against refugees was raging through Europe already, so they promised that they are gonna be a centre-right party of young people, but focused on family and welfare and that they are not going to let refugees in. Civic Platform still had an advantage, but because of the internal fights and arrogance it was getting smaller and smaller and finally, they lost presidental elections. Parliamenatry elections were even worse because new Modern party(ALDE) rised and took some votes from them.

PiS got 38% of votes, but two leftist party also splitted, United Left(coalition of leftist parties) got 7,8%(threshold for coaltion is 8%) and Together(New Left) got 3%,(threshold for parties is 5%). Other ring wing libertarians got 4,76 and boom, 15% of the votes went to the thrash bin and PiS got majority of votes in parliament.

This comes mostly from gangs in the Baltic regions that easily escapes via the Öresunds bridge and the ferries from the next town over, Trelleborg to Poland. This is the plight of being the gateway to the continent.

Regarding the shootings and the bombings, yes they do happen. Mostly in the ghettos and it's all gang related. Done in the middle of the night, when no one is around. It's a scary escalation but no one have been harmed by a bomb so far as they haven't been used with that as the intention.

Otherwise I'd say it's a normal city where people live a normal life. It's a beautiful summer city with lots of events. A couple of sandy beaches and bath houses for those warm summers. Lots of nice parks for people to roam. A fuck load of malls to spend both time and money at.

Not a lot of clubs though but thr night life is great and they do let lesser know artists get their chance to shine so this is a great town to watch the rough diamonds before they get famous. Just gotta find them.

2821,"&gt;You're not a dictator so you don't have private individual veto power. If you want to have more influence, convince other people.

Your answer not to the point. Still it shows democracy is a dictatorship of majority.

&gt;No, we can't. Because you end up with a ""who will guard the guardians?"" problem: how do you select the people who will judge whether the deciders are capable?

It was explained. By tests. How do you choose if someone is capable of driving? How do you chose if someone is capable of being a teacher or an engineer? Do you vote or do you have tests to see if you have knowledge?

&gt;Furthermore, you'd end up with a (hopefully enlightened) despotism because at some point your superior elite will have a different opinion about something than the population will then proceed to force it on the population. So you'd still end up wasting a whole lot of energy controlling and fighting against your own population: it will not be guaranteed to be enlightened, but it will be guaranteed to be despotism.

I'd rather live in enlightened despotism than in democracy full of idiots. I am utilitarian by heart and I would like to see humanity progress not degress as we have in democracies right now where stupid people vote.

&gt;The specifics depend on the country, but yes, that makes perfect sense if you realize that it's about obtaining consent, not about making the best decisions. Technical decisions don't depend on voting, too, so it wouldn't even matter.

Would you obtain a consent from group of sadists to mutilate your body? Because that is what you want. For a group of sadist to decide what to do with you because it is ""democracy"".

&gt;It's not that easy to become elected. If you can do that, you definitely have a better ""knowledge about how politics work"", as you said.

Check Polish politicians ""Kononowicz"" and ""Łukasz Tusk"". Both were used by people who did know how politics work while on their own having no idea how it works(one is mentaly handicapped other was just hired by political group because of surname). It is not easy to be elected. But being elected doesn't mean you have any idea what you are doing.

&gt;If you think it's too easy, go ahead, get elected and do better. Democracy offers that option.

If I wanted to be elected and was sociopath or psychopath who are preferable in democratic elections then I would be elected. I know how I would easily gain votes saying things I do not agree with. Because it is not hard to get votes. It is hard to be a sociopath for people who aren't sociopaths.

&gt;Simply getting elected is a sufficient test for political awareness. Demagogues only get elected because they appeal to sentiments that exist among the population. Now we are forced to address those sentiments. That's a feature, not a bug.

As said above. Getting elected has nothing to do with political awareness. You can be a pawn with no political awareness.

Being forced to address sentiment being ""a feature"" is a nice whitewashing of nasizm and Holocaust from your side. It was just a feature.

&gt;They have political goals. If they want to see those realized, they'd better hire some real experts that are good at their job.

What political goals can you have in ""democracy"" that can put you out of office after 4 years? Most goals will consist of getting rich as fast as you can. Do you go to a job and think - yes I will only work here 4 years? Do you start a company and think - yes my company will last only 4 years?

&gt;If you assume that everyone is plainly corrupt and out for personal gain: there is no system that will produce anything else but corruption if you try to run it with corrupt people. 

I do not assume that everyone is corrupt. I assume that most of the people are just plain stupid and unable to vote because they have no knowlegde about politics.

&gt;t least under a democracy exposing corruption is incentivized because that tends to get you votes at the expense of the corrupt ones.

Only thing I can say is - BULLSHIT.

&gt;Unless the population accepts corruption of course, but under that circumstance it's not possible to get a better result under any system.

And again BULLSHIT. Population does not accept corruption, but the elected has the means to cover corruption and elected are the people who judge themselves over corruption. And populi has short memory and is emotional (ready any psychology of crowd book) so even if the ruling party is corrupted they can easily obtain votes by playing on emotions of populi. Especially stupid ones. It has nothing to do with a system but much to do with stupidity of the people.

&gt;Old habits die hard. People who used to be corrupt are afraid to stop being corrupt because they have learned that they will be the sucker left holding the bag if they aren't. How long has your government been a democracy?

Why do you ask how long my government was a democracy? Does it matter? We are talking hypothetical things. Argument about ""young democracy"" would be flawed here. Yet government is chosen by people who aren't government. And incompetent and corrupt officials ate chosen mostly because they are chosen by uneducated stupid people.

2840,"After WWI the German public was experiencing chaotic times with a lot of uncertainty. A lot of people wanted stability and were mentally ready for a genius leader to save the country from its decline. Eventually the big Nazi minority gained power with the help of president Hindenburg. Adolf Hitler and the Nazi party got rid of democracy and were preaching to make Germany great again. The war started with the justification that the contract of Versailles was too harsh. Why did the war continue after that? Probably because Germany was so deep in debt by that point. The support of the German public was solely built on the promise of employments and economic improvements. Stopping the war would likely have led to a collapse of the financial system which could have overthrown the dictator government. So instead of paying their debts with the German economy, they chose to invade their neighbors and finance their expenses with stolen resources. Because they had hands down the best military in Europe, the war was very successful and led to more support of the German people. Because of that they continued the war again and again.

All of this was explained, justified and preached to the German public with xenophobic, antisemitic and racist propaganda. The enemy had to be a subhuman creature to justify taking every measure against it. The nazi idea was likely just as much of a reason for the war than the economic situation and domestic politics. The nazi idea introduced aesthetics into politics. Sorting people by race, eliminating those who don't fit the ideal, shaping the world with one idea that is more important than human lives. Those are aesthetic reasons. It is no coincidence that Adolf Hitler identified first and foremost as an artist, and war was his artistic tool. And for the perfect artwork, one needs to take extreme measures. One could also argue that the war was inevitable in that sense -  a natural continuation of the nazi idea, if you will. This is the reason why we have to be very careful with traits of nazi ideology in modern politics. The step from idea to calamity is quick and easy.",Brussels,/r/europe/comments/8cnd60/the_german_reichstag_in_1900_old_cupola/dxh4xx2/,FliccC,1523914639

Edit: For example, my mother was not working for a while. He was able to go to hospital and etc thanks to my father's social security. Because law says ""Your partner in a marriage is eligable to use your social security rights, as well your official kids"".

My parents had both legal and religious wedding (Religious wedding is imam comes to your home, prays couple of things and says you are wife and husband now etc). Now if my parents were just religious wedding couple, she couldn't have any rights like I mentioned above. Because government does not care if an ordinary imam said ""you are wife and husband now"". 

On the other hand, according to religion, sex outside of religious marriage is a sin. So you need sex to have kids. If one is religious, it tries to obey to this rule normally. But on the other hand if you only do religious marriage, it is enough in front of god that you can have sex. Because god doesn't care about a couple of government paper. So technically one can just have a religious marriage and not a government one, and if this couple has kids it would not be a sin for them but it would still look on paper as this couple had kids out of marriage because only marriage is kept record is Legal government marriage and it has nothing to do with religion.

2926,"&gt; It's ethnic cleansing, it's against those human rights things I thought we all agreed on and didn't have to argue about any more.

It's not, actually. Refugees aren't immigrations by default. Refugees are forced to abandon their home country because it's unsafe due to (conflict). The host country, or by international treaties is not actually obligated to take part fully, but a lot chooses to do so.

There's a lot of law involved with this but it's perfectly fine to assume a refugee is going to return to their country of origin. Claiming that people are ""proposing ethnic cleaning"" because of this is what's proposterous.

&gt; Where in the Geneva convention does it even say that? Either way I'm pretty sure it doesn't force any country to return refugees when it's safe to do so, it only allows it at most.

Treaties aren't forcing by nature, but they strongly hint that returning is an important part of shielding a refugee. Countries who does not wish to obey this may run the risk of breaking international law depending on the circumstances.

&gt; And Sweden's laws has up until now not allowed that, so to change it now would be... Well, I'm pretty sure it would break at least article 9 of the human rights declaration. 

What are you talking about? We're discussing international law, you can't hold refugees against their will.

&gt; About arbitrary detention/arrest/exile. It's a bit borderline I guess if they aren't Swedish citizens. But considering they previously had a legal right to stay here, removing that for no legally justifiable reason is almost certainly a no-no.

If they're illegal in the country it's not borderline to arrest them because they break laws by being in the country illegally. There are thousands of people who go underground and it's linked to crime since it's easy to for instance abuse these people and/or they can commit crimes of their own.

&gt; Either way, do you have like no empathy for these people? I would honestly not think I would have to argue about this with people? I completely understand wanting to limit the number of refugees accepted into a country, or immigrants in general. But to throw out people already living here is fucking cold.

I do but that shouldn't be the main argument here. If they wished to immigrate they should go through proper channels so the Swedish society doesn't lose on it every time. Your definition of living is litterally just having to flee their host country because of conflict. A host country is being quite generous in providing food, shelter, education and money for free. As a society, especially as small as Sweden it doesn't come as a surprise that several aspects of it is failing, like health care.",Sweden,/r/europe/comments/8cm9w4/swedens_violent_reality_is_undoing_a_peaceful/dxgwx72/,IntelligentNickname,1523907318

And you are the ones that get offended that they overuse it. 

&gt;Don't say ""people like you"". You're trying to place an opinion on me.

Yeah, sorry about that. 

&gt;I don't get what you're trying to say with that last part either, are you saying that all humans are inherently a little racist or that just Swedes are a little racist?

All humans. I mean there's probably some that really aren't. But prejudice is an extremely natural human thing. The goal of these anti-racism people is to work against human nature in this case, eradicate racism as a concept pretty much. While a lot of the ""racist offenders"" also don't like racism. But their definition of racism is different and only refers to actual hurtful acts or that sort of thing. So when the anti-racism people start calling people racists they get extremely offended because they imagine something much worse than it really is. If they would just be like ""oh, I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to"", or that sort of thing, then there wouldn't be a huge issue in most cases. Likewise the anti-racists could be more understanding of regular people who might be a bit ""racist"", but don't really hurt anyone. But the two camps just don't go well together, that's the problem. 

I don't know this, but I think most Swedes are somewhere in between, in principle they support the anti-rasism group. As far as that their ideas doesn't really hurt anyone. But they are also not very ready to commit to it, because in the end they don't really think it's the most important thing in the world. But yeah, that's just my thoughts, might be misjudging people in that case. I've witnessed the first thing I wrote about way too many times though, as someone who has and has had friends on relatively extreme ends of both sides. 

&gt;This is exactly what I mean. You automatically go to the extreme without any regards to the discussion or topics at hand.

Just said what I thought, what's so extreme about it? You went pretty extreme to start with. If you were talking about only giving out temporary residence permits and that sort of thing I wouldn't have disagreed, but that is definitely not politically incorrect, so that's clearly not what you meant. Just starting to deport people who weren't born in this country is pretty much the definition of ethnic cleansing.

All the moderates need to do is give up the whole ""cultural equivalency"" narrative and recognize that Western culture is obviously significantly better than the third world countries where these migrants came from (duh, that's why most want out to come to the west).  At that point you can look at the situation rationally and see that clearly these people have very limited experience existing outside of the cultures they came from and will need significant effort integrating.  If European countries can see that and reduce migrant numbers to more moderate amounts, people can actually integrate into Western culture instead of isolating into pockets of isolated slums as has been the case in sweeden.  

The prevailing narratives seem to be that either all migrants are great people looking to bring our society the wonders of cultural exchange, or they're all murderous terrorists.

No of course I'm not claiming every single Muslim is responsibly for any act of terror in France. That would be an absurd thing to claim and you're just setting up strawmen there.

Your and my Muslim friends are irrelevant quite frankly. The issue of violent anti-French/anti-West terrorism exists within the Muslim community and it is an issue that has been borne out of Muslim immigration *to* France, it is an issue that would not have existed without that immigration. Do you understand that?

*France would not be grappling with this terrorism without mass immigration from North Africa, this is why many are opposed to further immigration from Muslim countries*.

I also know that they are a real thing and that there are real problems relating to those areas, which is why I made sure to point that out, but you apparently missed that. But calling them ""no-go zones"" is extremely misleading at best.

Go there, to the more populated places with sign that says Allah is gay if you truly believe that, but we both know you aren't going to do that without police escort, and I'm not saying it's a no-go zone because you can't do *that*, but it's no-go zone because you can't do that among other things.

&gt;It started when an English article reported about these ""vulnerable areas"" as no-go zones. They exist in other countries too, but are typically not the same as the ones in Sweden, which makes the name confusing. A few of them could probably be compared to some other so called zones in other countries, but we have 50 something of these areas in Sweden, and most of those are just regular fucking suburbs with a somewhat higher than usual crime rate.

Even adding benefits and whatnot isn't enough in most cases and not all that many countries in the world have the economy to support that, at least in a way that brings any significant results. If that was that easy, every developed country in the world would have fixed that problem and so far none have.
Focusing on education isn't enough to bring skills, and developed countries don't have a problem with lack of a skilled workforce as far as I know. In fact if anything the problem is that there's too many skilled workers without a job because the young have a hard time competing with the old due to lack of experience and many other factors and the economy isn't yet in a state that makes it possible for most sectors to be booming and hire new blood.
Automation will take the jobs of a lot of people, which despite being the way forward and will inevitably happen, it won't occur overnight specially since it's a rather touchy subject not every politician wants to touch, let alone openly support with actual action (ie policies, benefits, etc).

I personally view SDs and AfS ""solutions"" as too simplistic and irresponsible.

3106,"&gt;Yet the German military is not fit for purpose, according to Hans-Peter Bartels, the German parliamentary ombudsman charged with overseeing the country's armed forces, known as the Bundeswehr.

&gt;Bartels found that only 38 of Germany's 114 high-tech Eurofighter jets are operational, Deutsche Welles reported. It also has 93 Tornado fighter jets, but only 29 of them work. The number of German soldiers was around 600,000 at the end of the Cold War in the early 1990s. Today the country has just 177,000.

&gt;These deficiencies have led to embarrassing episodes among the few foreign missions in which German forces are currently deployed. Last week, the German tabloid newspaper Bild revealed that six of the country's Tornado jets that are conducting reconnaissance missions against the Islamic State in Syria cannot fly at night because their cockpit lights are too bright for their pilots' eyes.

Not really, education being free is just one factor. E.g. the level of education of your parents is just as, if not more, important. Also the environment you grow up in.

Also I am a bit confused about your point:

&gt; because Germans don't hire them.

I mean discrimination is a thing and especially when it comes to jobs Germany isn't exactly leading in fighting it. I actually did work for a financial firm in Germany and finance in Germany is more elitist than e.g. in the UK and event the US. Almost everyone graduated from a private, not public, university. E.g. EBS, WHU, FSFM... and those graduates are almost all exclusively from rich German families because an average German family couldn't afford the tuition fees for those private universities. UK and US top unis like Cambridge or Harvard are actually more geared towards low income people than German private universities. And top banking and consulting jobs are like 80% recruited from private universities.

3158,"If by native American you are referring to North America then you would also need to include bows and arrows, traps and canoes(these differ from nation to nation). Interestingly, some cultural groups lived in longhouses (yes, like vikings).

In terms of the rest of America /Pacific 

The Pacific islanders figured out sea travel very early. 

Mesoamerica was host to a number of large empires, modern estimates suggest that some of these empires may have eclipsed Europe in population. 

Natives in the Arctic and sub Arctic regions were well versed in technology that made sense for them. I'd like to see a European build an igloo as good as an Inuit.

What you're assuming is that it's only *natural* for Humans to arrive at the same technologies. In reality, one only develops technology if one feels as though they need it. Europe did a lot of warring, therefore better weapons became a priority. With better weapons came metalworking which produced more efficient agricultural tools.

Native north Americans weren't big on war as a general rule (some nations were) and Aztec warfare was fought differently than European warfare (sieges and biological warfare didn't figure into their worldviews). Additionally north American warfare typically had a greater emphasis on taking prisoners (some groups even adopted foreign prisoners). As such it makes little sense to use sharp/heavy objects to subdue prisoners when it only increased the risk of death. 

If they had needed swords, firearms etc. Then they probably would have arrived at some kind of gunpowder weapon and through advancements in metal working would have had metal hoes, ploughs etc.

Native tribes that traded with early European settlers did trade for agricultural implements and alcohol. (fun fact: as sex before marriage wasn't taboo in native cultures, many native women would sleep with settlers (who hadn't had access to potential partners for months) in exchange for some goods).

Native groups began to obtain firearms from Europeans as a means of resisting the advances of other European groups. This formed an example of proxy, colonial wars in the new world.

It's true that native groups did attack and kill large numbers of settlers. Though this formed a part of a larger, more complex back and forth, I'll attempt to explain the dynamic in Virginia 

- [settlers arrive and nearly starve due to lack of agricultural knowledge, as a gesture of good faith, the Powhatans and other native groups provide them their excess food, this continues for some time. One winter, the Powhatans don't have enough to feed themselves and the settlers; the settlers then raid native food stores, leading to the starvation of many natives. In reprisal, certain native groups begin attacking settlements. This eventually cools down, but the natives refuse to feed (pay tribute)  to the settlers. John Rolfe discovers how good Virginia soil is for growing tobacco and suddenly every Englishman wants in on this cash crop. The UK assumes monarchistic control of the Virginia company and begins increasing the size of the operation. The natives groups see women arriving in addition to men and say ""Oh shit, they're gonna expand."" This creates more conflict. After the US starts the war of independence, the natives pick sides, those that side with the UK are forced West, those that side with US are allowed to keep small amounts of territory, this doesn't last. As the US demands they move, they attempt to skirmish with the US army, but lack the numbers to win and are forced West too.]

I think its a different case altogether, but I admit I'm ignorant on that subject, so I don't know how much I can say about this accurately without messing up so feel free to correct me. 

I do have to say that its a whole other ball game compared to Eastern Europe, which don't have those levels of artificial borders. If i'm not mistaken, many of the countries there today are composed of similar ethnicities or have already been countries for many years beforehand correct? Czechoslovakia was a more similar case but had a cleaner break as well as a stable environment as well as a reason that tied them together before that was no longer a thing anymore. 

With the middle east and parts of Africa its not like that at all. Again, not making excuses or whining or whatever but I don't think the situation is comparable. If you unite a people together that have no interest in it for a country that hasn't existed ever in their history for an identity that was made up randomly you'll find that people only stick to two things, their ethnicity and religion or a dictator that keeps things together with an iron fist. 

That brings me to your other point of why haven't they just settled down and redrawn the map or just made progress? Tbh, I agree with you on that partially. Yes they could have, but its much harder in practice especially with their history. An attempt at this was made with the Arab spring in 2011, but well...I mean we have a civil war in Syria right now because the strongman dictators I mentioned before didn't want to lose power. Then foreign interests wanted to get involved and...well you can see where we're at today. It would have been the same thing with Sadaam eventually too had my country not invaded Iraq. Redrawing the map would also have been hard as well. An example would have been Sadaam, who wouldn't have given independence for Kurds (who also, with no surprise to anyone, also have a significant portion of their population in Syria). Its what I mean by original mistakes made by colonial powers in the first place. Had they paid attention to the history and divisions of the place and made a Kurdistan, you'd be hard pressed to find people who wouldn't agree that they would be a lot better off today. People can try hard to make progress and have their own countries but in conditions like that its easier said than done. 

Now does that excuse the actions of the people living there and resorting to things like religious extremism and genocide? No, and all that does is fan the flames and make things even worse. However, I feel its important to recognize how it got that way and how those conditions were able to persist. To me, at least, it makes sense. 

TLDR: I think the difference is that the middle east was set up to fail, whereas Eastern Europe was not so much.

I admit, i'm at the end of my knowledge of both Eastern Europe and the Middle East. If the situation really is that comparable then I guess I'm totally wrong with my assumptions. I guess I have much more to learn. I'd love to know more about Eastern Europe and its history though. Its something that I haven't gone in detail yet.

They can redeem themselves, nobody is ever convicted for life to be shun and never trusted - thought it does not help their chances of being trusted, as a big part of their voters went to SD and will most likely go there if they do not take a stricter stance on immigration (and other things).

With such big border that we have, I think its necessary to have a large amount of men ready even if their quality is not the highest - you can put a battalion here and there in the forest.

After the fall of communism, Russia had collapsed, first economically, then politically, with immediate end to any democratic developments there as a result.

It also made sense to assume Russia would recover and move back in, like they ended up doing in Ukraine. Maybe that's fine with you, I don't know.     
     
Shortly after Spain, Portugal and Greece overthrew their dictators, they joined the precursor of the EU, which had a very stabilizing effect. Even under the very severe circumstances of the financial crisis followed by the sovereign debt crisis, there was never any threat of reverting to a military dictatorship.    
     
Even if you do give the highest priority to your wallet, consider the fact that it's really not all that much money we're talking about. If you sum up the net EU receipts of these new member countries, about 15 billion, this comes down to about 0.08% of the GDP of the EU as a whole. In fact, the entire 2017 budget of the EU was only about 150 billion euro, a bit less than the government budget of Denmark. Compare that to the $4 trillion federal budget of the US.

That is exactly what the pro-independence parties had been doing for decades and there was precisely **zero** engagement from Madrid. Changing the constitution is **not a legal issue**, it is a **political** one as it can only be changed by the lengthy political process I outlined previously. 


So I have no idea where you are getting your timeline of decades from. Can you predict the future political whims of the major Spanish parties? There is no ""due process"" for Catalonia to engage with here, they can't do anything through the courts. They have tried to open negotiations again and again and been stonewalled, yet they still got elected with democratic mandates to try and achieve independence.


Even when push finally came to shove and they finally held an attempted binding referendum (after being elected by the Catalan people to do so) the President even forwent a showy declaration of independence instead instantly ""suspending"" the process towards independence and appealing for Madrid to come to the negotiating table. 


Instead of doing anything of the sort, he and members of his democratically elected Government are now being detained by the Spanish Government with real prospects of spending the rest of their natural lives in prison. All for carrying out their democratic mandate in the most open to compromise manner possible completely peacefully.

In other words, what people *see with their own eyes* is 20, 30, 40 percent. So really, I'm surprised people's average estimate is not higher.

2. Does this include the second, third, et cetera generation? Because if it doesn't, that is a big problem.

The facts are the only war crimes in Bosanska Krupa were done by Serbs who in 1992 forced all Bosniaks out of their homes. 



Oh actually found out what happened in a testimony on trial of Gojko Klickovic



Na suđenju za zločine u Bosanskoj Krupi, svjedoci Odbrane Gojka Kličkovića su govorili o “bezbjednosnom iseljavanju” Bošnjaka iz grada, te započinjanju sukoba na tom području 21. aprila 1992. godine.

“Tih dana osjećale su se velike tenzije među stanovništvom. U školi u kojoj sam radio kao profesor, počela su i otpuštanja. Srbi su naprasno ostajali bez posla. (...) Muslimani su 1992. godine otišli, ali to ja ne bih nazvao protjerivanjem. Oni su iseljeni i njih niko nije dirao, a Krupu su, isto kao i mi, napustili iz bezbjednosti”, rekao je Rajko Senić, svjedok Odbrane prvooptuženog Kličkovića.

Za niz zločina počinjenih na području Bosanske Krupe tokom 1992. godine, Tužilaštvo BiH tereti Gojka Kličkovića, Mladena Drljaču i Jovana Ostojića.

U optužnici se navodi da je tokom maja 1992. godine, “u skladu s pismenom naredbom Gojka Kličkovića”, bošnjačko civilno stanovništvo iz grada Krupe, te naselja Zalug, Arapuša, Zalin, Potkalinje, Veliki Dubovik i Velika Jasenica prisilno iseljeno na područje Bihaća i Sanskog Mosta.

O dešavanjima prvih dana sukoba u Bosanskoj Krupi govorio je i Branko Kljajić, koji je kazao da je srpsko stanovništvo u tom periodu masovno prelazilo sa lijeve na desnu obalu rijeke Une.

“Ne mogu da kažem da bi nam se nešto desilo da smo ostali, ali više nije postojalo povjerenje među Srbima i muslimanima. To je tako. Svako je išao u svoj ‘tor’. Mi smo prelazili sa lijeve na desnu stranu Une, a muslimani sa desne na lijevu. I tako smo se i spasili”, rekao je Kljajić.

We have a K130 corvette the Magdeburg in close range of Syria. Shiptracking: https://www.vesselfinder.com/de/?mmsi=211911000

The Braunschweig class ships have a launch platform not only for ship to ship but for ship to surface missiles too with 4*RBS-15 MK.3 missiles. 

If you look up the data from Saab 

&gt;The RBS15 Mk3 allows for true fire-and forget operability in all weather conditions, thanks to its advanced prelaunch programmable active radar seeker. Mission planning is performed through the Missile Engagement Planning System (MEPS), which provides the operator with built-in decision support and advanced salvo firing management. In combination with high system readiness, the missile system facilitates rapid reaction response to any threat.

&gt;

&gt;Outclassing its competitors with a range of more than 200 km, the RBS15 Mk3 offers greater stand off and defence penetration capabilities. Unbeatable defence penetration is achieved through the unique combination of an advanced active radar seeker with built in Electronic Counter Countermeasures (ECCM), low sea skimming, random manoeuvres and increased thrust in the terminal phase. 

 

&gt;Its long range combined with a large number of horizontal and vertical waypoints mean that the operator can make tactical use of its flexible  trajectory as well as using the missile for over-the-horizon targeting. The missile’s large and lethal 200 kg blast and fragmentation warhead is triggered by delayed impact or proximity fuse function, causing a devastating impact on any target, including large naval vessels.

Here is the lyric:

Joy, beautiful spark of the gods,

Daughter from Elysium,

We enter, drunk with fire,

Heavenly One, thy sanctuary!

Your magic binds again

What convention strictly divides;*

All people become brothers,*

Where your gentle wing abides.


Who has succeeded in the great attempt,

To be a friend's friend,

Whoever has won a lovely woman,

Add his to the jubilation!

Indeed, who calls even one soul

Theirs upon this world!

And whoever never managed, shall steal himself

Weeping away from this union!


All creatures drink of joy

At nature's breast.

Just and unjust

Alike taste of her gift;

She gave us kisses and the fruit of the vine,

A tried friend to the end.

[Even] the worm has been granted sensuality,

And the cherub stands before God!


Gladly, as His heavenly bodies fly

On their courses through the heavens,

Thus, brothers, you should run your race,

Joyful, like a hero going to conquest.


You millions, be embraced.

This kiss is for all the world!

Brothers, above the starry canopy

There must dwell a loving Father.

Do you fall in worship, you millions?

World, do you know your creator?

Seek him in the heavens

Above the stars must He dwell.

We've thankfully moved past the time in the most of Europe anyway where violence has to be used to gain self-determination, or deny it for that matter.


But that has only happened because governments have become susceptible to political pressure, from inside and without. The reasonable course of action is to give Catalonia a referendum, it should never have to get to the stage where Catalans would even consider using violence or the Spanish state would ever consider or feel untouchable enough to use violence to suppress the independist sentiment.


And to be clear, I'm not suggesting we're approaching a civil war. Only that the recent developments in Catalonia - specifically around how Madrid have conducted themselves and the weird hyper-nationalist narratives you can now find form outlets including some posts in this sub that seem to be craving some authoritarian central government crackdown are not exactly the direction we should be aiming for.



&gt; Hey, you can hope that Spain collapses under the weight of its sin or something, sure. Weirder things happened.


Something is going to have to give. I think the past referendum was a turning point where Catalan Independist political forces would no longer accept the issue of independence being completely shut down by Spain in perpetuity. If they keep winning elections it will be very hard for Madrid to continue to suppress the issue in a way that wont risk converting even more Catalans to the cause of independence.

That's the question you should ask yourself; And I told you why NATO does indeed help.. See Ukraine or Georgia for counter-examples on this..

No, I said that he listed Poland's economic advantages over Russia and he mentioned NATO which only protects them from theoretical invastion and isn't boosting their economy. Russia has almost the same GDP PPP per capita as Poland.

&gt; Ok, my bad.. Poland wasn't officially in USSR.. It was just controlled at every god damn level by it.. Sometimes I do, indeed forget that Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, 

It was pretty relevant and had a lot of sense. They were having their own government and situation in 1968 was possible because Czechoslovakian leade independently from the USSR have tried to reduce market-economy relations, although he crossed the red line. It means that those countries were independent on some not so kinda important things like economic system.

&gt; Yugoslavia

In 1949 USSR terminated the agreement of friendship and partnership with Yugoslavia, Yugoslavia is the founder of the Non-Alignment Movement, wasn't a part of the Warsaw pact, had a defensive agreement with Turkey and Greece which are NATO memebers, Yugoslavia condemned the Soviet invasion in Czechoslovakia in 1968 along with Romania. Yugoslavia was getting economic support from the US in 1945-1947, US also supported Yugoslavia by money in 1950 when they had a drought.

Hell, I walk around Warsaw and there are quite a few foreigners in the city. Now, if I didn't know English I wouldn't know that some are students or tourists. So if the people asked don't know much English, then they will  probably inflate the  numbers some. AlsoWarsaw also hosts a sizeable Ukrainian population and, for the most part, people won't notice them unless the Ukrainians start talking amongst themselves.

Tl;dr: we have quite a few immigrants but it's easy to assume that we don't since we have immigrants from the East and they tend to blend in a bit more.

4046,"The US has agreed to lots and lots of things too, which they didnt keep to. 

Americans dont realise the quota isnt a hard limit. It wasnt signed off in a treaty. It isnt a absolute minimum within the NATO statutes. Its a percentage that was deemed the standard minimum during the late cold war and well into the 1990s. It is incredibly foolish to just assume this standard would last into a completely different era. The 2% was the standard while Russia was a world power and started to destebalize from within. Half of its industry, its population and its wealth joined the EU. The EU is now, like i said, the largest combined military budget on earth, only second to that of the US.

The US are our allies (for now, believing Trump NATO wont last). To us it makes no sense to up all national militaries to 2% so that we (NATO) can fight the rest of the world combined by a factor of 5 instead of a factor of 2. 

Americans cant feel entitled to demand a raise of military investments without looking at themselves first. Trump considers Europe freeloaders on American tax money. Demanding more European military investments is okay. Obama did this, altho in a much more diplomatical and sensible sense. Trump straight out called Europeans freeloaders. The same Europeans that answered the call to arms from Washington after the 9/11 attack. Dozens of European states flew in with the Americans to serve our part of the deal. 

My cousin lost his left leg in 2002 because of this. He completely lost his mind when he saw the American president refer to Europeans as freeloaders on the American military. All Dutch soldiers that died since the 80s was because of American lead missions and operations. We've never let our international allies down. 

This form of disrespect only shows to me that Trump was right about 1 thing. NATOs days died with the fall of the Soviet Union. Europe **should** raise its military standards. But not to serve American missions even more. We need a European military to protect European principles, vallues and boundries, and for that we absolutely do not need America.

America will always remain in the list of other modern western democracies that stand on the same side as Europe, but NATO should be cancelled. The tolerance between Americans and Europeans has diminished so much we are only fooling ourselves that we would die for each others protection. 

I would support a war to defend Canada, the UK, Italy, Poland, France etc. I dont see the reason to do the same to a country that views the EU as its dominion. Countries like Canada and Australia see European states as allies. The US sees us as a tool. A possible battlefield against Russia. A base of operations against the middle east.

4094,"Just saying though, regardless of OP's argument, the context is completely different.

Christians in the Middle-East are a historical remnant. They were there before Islam spread. They're natives. But their populations have been dwindling since the spread of Islam, and in modern times, the few remnants of Christians in the Middle East have been dramatically decreasing in numbers in the last decades (in Lebanon, and Egypt notably, in Syria lately too) because of the pressure from the radicalization of these Islamic societies. 

Not to mention these societies are extremely community based. There may be churches and mosques, but they don't inter-marry, or rarely. You'll only find your high standards of tolerance in Western countries. Not over there, not anywhere else. 

Anyway, Muslims in Ireland, or in most of Europe, are recent waves of immigrants who, within a generation, have the capacity, through their numbers, to radically change neighborhoods, societies, and culture. That's not necessarily desirable. Actually, it's highly undesirable for any sane society. It's one thing to be an immigrant trying to assimilate to your adoptive country, it's another thing to plant your minarets in the landscape and congregate. Now the latter sort of thing has been done since time immemorial, since humans have mixed and migrated.

In the absence of conflicting evidence I have to lean towards believing that what my government says happened, happened. 

But I'm not a fan of getting involved because even if its a worthy cause we won't commit to it fully. 

But if this stays a limited strike (and everyone says its a one off) then perhaps we aren't getting so mired. And there is a benefit to showing autocratic bad actor states (russia, NK) that western nations still dominate the skies and can still do this sort of thing if we decide its warranted. 

But.. we already did this exact same thing a year ago and clearly it didn't do much to deter Assad. And there are other known chemical weapons facilities which were not destroyed.

4164,"&gt; Christians in the Middle-East are a historical remnant. They were there before Islam spread. They're natives

This is also irrelevant. What matters is the society and how it functions without one wiping out the other one.

&gt;  But their populations have been dwindling since the spread of Islam, and in modern times, the few remnants of Christians in the Middle East have been dramatically decreasing in numbers in the last decades (in Lebanon, and Egypt notably, in Syria lately too) because of the pressure from the radicalization of these Islamic societies.

Middle-East kept its multi-religious structure way better than Europe did. Spain banished Jews and Muslims for instance, not to mention forceful conversions and executions from time to time. Middle-East was where Jews fled to go from Europe, for instance. Spread of Islam did not wipe out Christianity in Middle-East, however spread of Christianity wiped out paganism in Europe. 

No one denies that today Europe is more tolerant (except Eastern Europe and Ireland, perhaps) though.

&gt; Not to mention these societies are extremely community based. There may be churches and mosques, but they don't inter-marry, or rarely. You'll only find your high standards of tolerance in Western countries. Not over there, not anywhere else.

Intermarrying is not so common in Europe either? You do see here and there, but it is nowhere close being a normal thing. It results with family clashes and shit most of the time. It really is not easy to make it happen due to many reasons.

&gt; Anyway, Muslims in Ireland, or in most of Europe, are recent waves of immigrants who, within a generation, have the capacity, through their numbers, to radically change neighborhoods, societies, and culture. 

Change is change, no matter if the a convert native does it or an immigrant does it, as long as no one is forcing anyone, I see no problem. I don't see the point of worry to be honest. I mean, we have mosques in Germany since 1960s. If it was like anything you guys make it to be, we would have been Muslims by now. However, Germans do not convert to Islam (do not show me some individuals who did, I am talking in masses).

&gt;  It's one thing to be an immigrant trying to assimilate to your adoptive country, it's another thing to plant your minarets in the landscape and congregate. Now the latter sort of thing has been done since time immemorial, since humans have mixed and migrated. But you shouldn't expect people or societies to take it without considering certain bounds to protect their ancestral or cultural social order.

As I said, if Muslims were able to change anything, they could have changed Germany, but nothing has changed in the way that you are predicting. ",,/r/europe/comments/8cgnni/this_is_kilkenny_not_mecca_angry_opposition_to/dxezdoz/,[deleted],1523821522

4188,"Before some busy-body asks why an article nominally related to Canada is posted here... about a third of the content refers to the EU specifically.

&gt;The reason, which Rodrik glosses over, is that clever people adapt to existing rules. And the private sector has adapted to half a century of tariff-abating trade agreements by turning to regulation to gain an edge. Germany and Austria recently decided that all paperwork relating to freight trucks passing through their countries must be translated into German, a move aimed largely at Poland. Poland, in turn, has changed its retail tax system to advantage local stores over large international chains from countries like Germany. Last year, France implemented a law that required all dairy and meat products to be labelled with their country of origin, rearing, and processing. It worked: French milk imports from Belgium fell by a quarter. Italy has now copied the French regulation and applied it to pasta: labels will be required to show the origin of the wheat used.

&gt;I cite these examples first to offer a flavour of what the current battleground looks like: Trade competition is being fought through labelling requirements, arcane safety-testing guidelines, and obscure regulatory annexes—the more obscure the better.

1. Any Member State may decide to withdraw from the Union in accordance with its own constitutional requirements.  
2. A Member State which decides to withdraw shall notify the European Council of its intention. In the light of the guidelines provided by the European Council, the Union shall negotiate and conclude an agreement with that State, setting out the arrangements for its withdrawal, taking account of the framework for its future relationship with the Union. That agreement shall be negotiated in accordance with Article 218(3)[9] of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. It shall be concluded on behalf of the Union by the Council [of the European Union], acting by a qualified majority, after obtaining the consent of the European Parliament.  
3. The Treaties shall cease to apply to the State in question from the date of entry into force of the withdrawal agreement or, failing that, two years after the notification referred to in paragraph 2, unless the European Council, in agreement with the Member State concerned, unanimously decides to extend this period.
4. For the purposes of paragraphs 2 and 3, the member of the European Council or of the Council representing the withdrawing Member State shall not participate in the discussions of the European Council or Council or in decisions concerning it.  
5. A qualified majority shall be defined in accordance with Article 238(3)(b) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  

If a State which has withdrawn from the Union asks to rejoin, its request shall be subject to the procedure referred to in Article 49.  

Secession is pretty clear what not defined in detail is procedures and this is done with intent as to give EU broader powers and better negotiating position in secession talks. UK is receiving nothing beneficial the transition period is given to UK by EU law as is extension of said period. 

Not to mention that there are other articles regarding succession Catalonia would also need to first settle all border disputes, establish a central bank, repay all their obligations to Spain for the fiscal year as well as pay Spains share of the EU obligations for the current budget cycle.

I think they want to mix those things up. So if the public reject the deal they believe it will spur parliament and the government into remaining in the EU by attempting to reverse A50. However, I think /u/noxav is correct when he says a vote that leads to a rejection of the deal will just lead to a hard brexit.

4449,"(Responding to your other comment here as well)

Yes! I saw the other comment about supersition (I responded there as well), but I can't find anything myself in Swedish or in English (you mentioned Finnish sources?) to support it. I can only find sources telling of occasional raids* and trading happening between Finns (I include all tribes in Finland here, not only Proper Finns) and Scandinavians. Furthermore I found sources telling about the technological levels and as far as I have understood it the Finns in general were slightly after in technological advancement by the time except for Proper Finland which is regarded as belonging to the Nordic tech level group (I have no idea what it's called in English :P), but the technology spread from there and inwards to Tavastland and onwards pretty quickly.

The documentary also told about how the Scandinavians needed to change the boats at Ladoga to a different type which was provided by the Finnish tribes there (Karelians I guess) with which they were able to traverse the rivers downwards to Constantinople (or Miklagård). The Finnish tribes also had contacts all the way down to the Abbasid Caliphate and the vikings going on the trips would also trade and raid these areas.

I saw sources also telling about Finnish raids in Sweden which was interesting, so I suppose raiding happened both ways, although it doesn't seem to have been vikings living in Finland, but rather people from these Finnish tribes?

*There are remnants of around 90 proto-forts along the coastline which would be an indicator that there were hostilities. There are also mentions about the signal beacons as I'm sure you are aware of as well.

No, it's because there wasn't enough violence to warrant the high treason offense, which would be the german equivalent. It's not as simple as ""there's no equivalent offense"".

4486,"You're points are only half the truth. Mostly the half that's true for wealthy individuals.

1) Health insurance can't be directly compared between the US and most European countries. For example, co-pays and deductibles for every aspect of care are much higher in the US, even for your personal doctor/family doctor/GP this can be $100 [and up](https://www.policygenius.com/blog/doctor-visit-cost-deductible-copayment-coinsurance/). 

2) Also, wait times for specialist care are just as high in many parts of the US, [especially in cities](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucejapsen/2017/03/19/doctor-wait-times-soar-amid-trumpcare-debate) (where those specialists are located).

3) The best hospitals/universities may be in the US but they are definitely not easily accessible for someone earning an average income. You may have to choose between spending ""those 30%"" you mention either on education or healthcare. 

4) Your number of 30% doesn't really fit at all. The average disposable income in the US [is around $44,000](http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/countries/united-states) and for many people it's much lower, as the wealth gap is much larger than in other developed countries. The average cost of studying [at an American private college is $50,900 per year, for state college $25,290 per year](https://www.collegedata.com/cs/content/content_payarticle_tmpl.jhtml?articleId=10064). *Much* more than 30% in both cases. 

5) One more thing about your US/Norway comparison: You say that in the US you can *choose* to spend 30% on your education while in Norway you are forced to. What you forget is that in Norway both education and healthcare are basically free, thus accessible for everybody. Norway only has 3 universities (and only 5m inhabitants), all ranked in the top 300 worldwide. There is no bad college in Norway, while many American ones [are struggling](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2015/07/20/how-many-colleges-and-universities-do-we-really-need) More comparison:

&gt;""Investment in research and development is highest in Denmark, Sweden and Switzerland. The United States dominates the total output of research journal articles, but Sweden is the biggest producer of articles per head of population. The nations whose research has the greatest impact are Switzerland, the Netherlands, the United States, United Kingdom and Denmark. While the US and UK have the world's top institutions in rankings, the depth of world class higher education institutions per head of population is best in Switzerland, Sweden, Israel and Denmark.""

* ""unity in the opposition party"" (There was a lot of smaller party, and no big one, especially in the left wing. In a lot of regions Fidesz actually got under 50%, but because the opposition's votes dissipated between multiple parties, Fidesz still won that region.)

Humans would use reddit from certain IP addresses (home/work/school) while bot because of constant change would always connect from different address, something that is really unlikely a human would do. Additionally you could check device information that connected to the website, its normal for one user to use one or two devices. Its not normal for 1000 users to use the same one or two devices. Track their activity patterns, humans will have to sleep and can't write multiple comments in seconds and are unlikely to upvote/downvote random posts all over reddit, if devs are lazy the bots will just come to specific post and upvote it, a normal person first would somehow navigate to that post from with in the website.

Biases aren't determined by having different opinions and supporting different sides. Just because one side opposes another doesn't mean they're equally viable.

For instance, the wall could be painted with a theme that didn't align with most people's sense of aesthetics (choice of colour, for instance), and it most likely would have arised a very different kind of debate or none at all.

Secondly yes to suggest military intervention by use of ground troops to the extent of Iraq would under no circumstances be the best decision for Syria, assuming things remain the same as they are now. Not only would the west kill more innocent civilians but they'd also guarantee Syria's instability for decades to come. Need I remind you the Syrian army wasn't the only group in the war to have used chemical weapons and the stockpiles of weapons Assad does have would most likely be used entirely if an invasion occurred. It would also lead to a power vacuum and let rise to another dictator assuming the US stopped at liberation, of course they could occupy the region for years to come but to what end.

I wasn't comparing their approach to Iraq and Libya's, I was just stating that it could be the precursor to such an event. If it's left at what just happened then that's fine but I highly doubt it will.

If Assad started to attack other nations and infringe on their sovereignty I would 100% agree with you but he hasn't.

The origin of one's ancestors.

&gt;How long back do you have to look?

Forever. We all have ancestry outside of our country of origin but by and large the vast majority of the population's vast majority of ancestors come from a very small piece of land. Hell, you could probably even draw ancestry based on far smaller units than a state. If we went 100 years back, villages would have very clear ancestries.

Second, if things escalate like they did in Iraq? Afghanistan? Lybia? Are you serious? They have already escalate, a long time ago. In the real world, the death toll of the Syrian war is higher than the overall casualities of the Iraq War. The Syrian war isn't a minor conflict compared to those. In fact, one can say that what happened and is happening in Syria shows how non-interventionist approaches by the West can lead to horrific disasters, just like interventionist approaches can. And that's without counting all the people Assad murdered, tortured and enslaved before the war. 

I have found some people are so obsessed and unhinged by American military interventions, either real or imaginary, that they live in a completely alternate reality. As in, if there's a military American intervention, then that's the worst case scenario, eo ipso - in the alternative reality where that intervention didn't exist, things would surely have been much better. If there isn't, then an American intervention will always make it much worse. Moreover, conflicts where the American intervention is either small or non-existent are always minor things by definition, even if they're far more devastating than those where the US played a major role - this comment of yours is exemplarly in that regards.

Basically the appointment of a commissionaire is the EU saying to its national governments that they're still rulling a soveirgn country, so please appoint an arbiter to decisions that you may disagree with or may veto. 

Everyone votes on what they get to deal with. The commission, made by appointees of the sitting governments at the time of its forming enforces the laws, the council reflects the wishes of the national governments at any given time and the parliament the wishes of the people at any given time.

There were also many constituencies where entire opposion parties vanished due to a rule where if there are more votes in the urns than the amount of people who voted, the excess votes will be taken away from everyone (ie. 180 voters, but 210 votes in the urn - everyone loses 30, so Fidesz can still have lets say 60, but everyone else has 0 votes.

&gt;being that of keeping Iran off the South Caucasus

I think this is actually a very good thing, I view Iran to be one of the biggest dangers to South Caucuses. The two major players seem to be Turkey and Russia, United States in all honesty is not even involved in the region besides offering minimal support to Georgia and their grasp in Turkey (neighboring Caucuses) diminshes every year. Most support from Georgia is even provided by Turkey, not the United States ; such as Turkey inviting Georgia to NATO drills, Turkey training Georgia's military, etc.

It might appear good for Armenia to involve Iran in the region, but if Iran is involved. Shouldn't be surprised if Azerbaijan one day becomes like Iran and becomes a religious state which can draw religious support from Shi'ite militias like Iran is able to do in Iraq, Syria and Lebanon. These groups will utimately arrive and fight for Iran when needed... On other note, goal of Iran might have in the region is establishing a Talyshistan, which large portion of our south border will disappear. Their goal has always been to weaken us and destroy us as a nation.

Fucking Iranians already spew their bullshit online about Talyshistan and even about other groups: (REMOVED LINK) and not to my surprise I see Armenian names liking these articles. I am trying to emphasize Armenian involvement with Iran will only be detrimental to South Caucuses and to keep Iran the fuck out of this region. Whatever Iran involves themselves in they ruin. I say this because I see many Armenians who are keen to invite Iran into this area as if that balances Turkish influence in the region when that is Russia's role.

&gt;Also Armenia depending on Russia is not exactly in Armenia's favour either. Russia plays a balancing role - to keep both equal. That is not benefitting Armenia, nor Azerbaijan. It is benefitting Russia first. In 1994 there was no balance, the Armenian side won and had superiority, and yet it was precisely Russia which blocked them to push for something more than a ceasefire, from which point Russia's balancing role began.

Pretty much summed up in what I said above, but I still don't entirely agree. Russia is there to play foreign politics of Russia which Armenian is involved in, Azerbaijan is not. It is Russia protecting Armenian borders, Russia protecting Abkhazia and Ossetia, not anyone else. Russia doesn't want another war in their south borders though which I can agree with. Turkey has our backs, Russia is there to forcefully put their hands in our pockets.

&gt;The issue is that they officially use religion to this end.

Would these reasons provided by Pakistan have been the same reasons provided by Le Pen to support Armenia? I see no monetary or political incentives for Le Pen claiming to support Armenia out of Christianity, and an Islamic aggressor 'harassing' Armenia.

&gt;Turkish children are being brainwashed into Islam faster than Iran ever did. Unless some drastic changes occur that is what is waiting for Turkey. Ask a Turk who lives in Turkey who is in touch with what is going on in the school system. Sure at the end a synthesis of nationalism and Islamism could be put in place. But I assure you that Erdogan is not only using Islam as a rhetoric, but as a concrete policy for Turkey... and beyond. I agree with right wing policies of the others you mention including their use of religion.

Maybe you are right as I'm not living in Turkey. I've always been under the impression that these groups exists, but are balanced by other nationalistic groups and even by Kelamists who want to retain a secular system in their country. But I do recall seeing a video that some Turkish children recites (aftr being daught) that were Islamist in nature.

It's such a shame that we are not able to throw Islam down the toilet and realize that Islam is not compatible with Turkic culture or peoples. Islam is more of a proxy toward Arabism. Christianity has its threats, but not in todays politics and not the same extent as seen with Islamism.

&gt;Sure, but my point with the link is him saying this in the EOC (Another islamic union like the OIC). The context is religious in nature. That is Turkey using Islam to favour Azerbaijan. A bad analogy could be Armenia going to the EU Parliament (not same thing but I cannot think of a similar Christian OIC, it doesn't exist) and officially stating that EU members should support Armenia because of it being Christian. That would be an insane thing to do.

These sorts of religious institutions shouldn't even exist firstly, but I don't know how peopel would excuse or why people are OK with the Catholic Church's political power and it continung to be a political entity with its own nation state I believe? Either way the OIC offers no large support for Azerbaijan despite Azerbaijani ruling establishment trying to make it a religious conflict only to these Muslim groups.

I also say ruling establishment, because it is an establishment. Aliyev is just the figurehead of this establishment which is composed of wealthy families who've formed mafioso clans of power. His wife who is vicepresident also calls from an extremely wealthy and influential family. Azerbaijani government is mafia run, similar to some of these other countries you see in eastern Europe.

&gt;I would say this has more to do with Arab-Turkish issues than with Arab-Armenian issues - again it matters which country, as some have (or had) significant Armenian population.

If you know anything about Turkish-Arab relations, it is Turks who constantly bend their backs for Arabs and bleed for them (like seen in Mavi Marmara) or incidents of even Hamas operating in Turkey. Turkey puts itself in detriment trying to have good relations with these people; even 3,000,000 Syrians in Turkey now, and they spit on us as repayment.

You ask my opinion it is not Armenians or other who are threat to Turks, but Arabs and Islam. I have serious problems with Islam and other religions, but I don't think this justifies in harassing, insulting or attacking Muslim people who are not involved in these sorts of politics.",,/r/europe/comments/8ab3md/in_the_trenches_with_the_armenian_fighters_we/dxe2zix/,AzeriPride,1523772853

5058,"The Bellingcat article you're citing attributes the attacks to ""Syrian regular forces"", but is linguistically garbled and confusing because the author clearly isn't a native speaker.

Quoting:

&gt; Syrian regular forces continued their military escalation in several towns and cities in the besieged Eastern Ghouta, as they launched the most violent military attacks on those areas using several types of weapons. On Monday morning, January 22, 2018, the residential neighbourhoods in the northwest region of Douma were subjected to an attack with a chemical agent described as chlorine gas by locals, and according to many testimonies obtained by Syrians for the Truth and Justice(STJ), several rockets loaded with chemicals believed to be chlorine gas fell in those neighbourhoods, suffocating 21 civilians including women and children.

&gt; The attack came in the context of the military campaign launched by the Syrian regular forces on whole cities and towns in Eastern Ghouta on November 15, 2017

https://www.bellingcat.com/news/mena/2018/02/05/details-january-22nd-2018-chlorine-attack-douma-damascus/

What you are doing here is relying on bluff and a lack of patience by Redditors who won't actually read the source you're deliberately misrepresenting.

Bellingcat and SJT in no way, shape or form attribute this attack to other entities than the Syrian military, and you have no basis for claiming this other than your willingness to distort, bluff and lie, hoping we won't actually click the link and read for ourselves.

Maybe they want to live in an ""agricultural superpower"" and are angry that Vatutin and these men and women who came to honour him prevented them from it all the way until now - but, regardless, their opinion is not a mandatory one to have in any European country, and the fact that ""Sumerian"" police decided to basically back them in their ""action"" is an absolute fucking disgrace.

And to answer your question more explicitly: 
About 1000years ago, the British isles were largely speaking a newish Germanic dialect that we now call Anglo-Saxon (Anglo means angelic/English, Saxony is a Northwest part of Germany).

There was an invasion of England by the French and the English throne for a few hundred years spoke French. But the farmers in the countryside continued to speak Anglo-Saxon or German.

So the word cow, that a farmer would speak, is from German: Kuh. 

But the word beef, that a higher class person would order from their servants, comes from the French.  Beouf.

Many many English words, about 70%, come from Latin through French, but the simple farmer type words continue from German.

&gt;Which is their right. Makes them deplorable human filth, but nonetheless, there's nothing illegal about simply holding opinions - however evil. The question is whether it's okay to break the law, vandalise public monuments, and block war veterans (the most respected group in the rest of Ruthenian countries) from paying respects to their fallen commander. That's it!



Poland is Slavic. Czech Republic is slavic. Slovakia is slavic. Ukrainians are slavic. Montenegro is slavic. Croatia is slavic.


You know something is wrong with Russia when all of these countries are joined or trying to join NATO over Russia.

The pro-gov't media's reach is near complete with the voting-age citizens, whereas the independent and/or opposition one's maybe 35-40%. So there's already a gigantic group of people who will only hear news from the rabid pro-govt sources. 

Combine that with those people being generally older, rural, less educated and poor to a point where they struggle to make ends meet, and as conceited as that sounds, they don't really have the mental acuity to question what they are told. They believe what the TV says *because* it's on the TV and because they hear/read the same from the radio and the one newspaper they come accross.

5300,"&gt;1. Why would Assad risk antagonizing the West when he is winning the war?


Maybe Assad didn't personally make the decision but some military commander did. Either way, the war isn't over yet and chemical weapons are effective at killing people. Maybe they thought they could get away with it without anyone noticing. 


&gt;2 Why didn't the US wait for the OPCW mission to Damascus to provide evidence?

Why would they? The US, France, and the UK all had their own intelligence on what happened and all concluded that it was a chemical attack. Once they had that conclusion they acted.

You can't wait 2 months for the OPCW to respond. You need to respond quickly. Also, these countries don't care what the OPCW says, they use their own intelligence operations to draw conclusions. 


&gt;3. There was one research facility bombed which may or may have not built chemical weapons but 4-5 military installations were also bombed. They had Hezbollah and Iranian Republican Guards presence. US and allies don't like it that Iran extended its influence to Syria. That's the reason for the attack.


That would be a silly reason. The US, France, and UK wouldn't go through all this drama just to attack one research facility where a coupe Iranian and Hezbollah guys are stationed out of thousands in syria. That would do nothing.

5314,"&gt; This was about as innocent of a strike as possible, 3 remote targets were hit that were all limited to focusing on the regime's chemical weapons facilities and yet people are freaking out. 

The US have been keen on regime change on Syria for years. During the bush years, then minister of defence Rumsfield formulated [the target](https://www.salon.com/2007/10/12/wesley_clark/""): *""We're going to take out 7 countries in five years Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan &amp; Iran.""* Noone knows what this was supposed the achive, but its obvious that these are all middle eastern countries that are not alligned to Saudi-Arabia. It seems as if this concept was made with the idea of making Saudia-Arabia a regional power. In consequence, most of the middle east would be governed by the same kind of islamist extremism that is predominant in Saudi-Arabia or possibly even worse factions. There is nothing Europe has to win from this, therefore supporting such plans is contraproductive. Bringing extremist sunnites into power should be opposed just due to the consequences for Europe, i.e. new waves of migrants. Wherever they got into power, sunnite extermists have commited genocides against minorities. The civil war in Lebanon saw a decrease in minority populations, the christian population in ""Iraq with Freedom"" has almost completely vanished. 

While it is certainly true, that Assad has used totalitarian means to govern, i.e. the Mukhabarat, he has managed to balance the interests and relations of the various religious and ethnical groups well for the most time. The situation can be compared to the Soviet Union after Stalin: Chruchtschew and Breschnew: They were not comparable to western standards of governments, but clearly preferable to people like Beria.",Austria,/r/europe/comments/8c6x3j/megathread_us_uk_and_france_launch_military/dxd7h5m/,Autogegner,1523734559

5371,"&gt; We could comfort you even more. Your chance of getting raped should be way lower. Maybe around 0.0000000000001%. 

0.0000000000001% * 80,000,000 means that 0.00000008 rapes should happen in Germany per year. While that is of course a desirable state, it is quite illusory.  

&gt; 15 years ago I already tried to avoid Wedding, Kreuzberg &amp; Neukölln. Nowadays they are actual no-go areas, at least for me. Last 2 times I used the fkng U8 Ive been groped and I only used it once a year during daytime.  

Last summer I lived there for 3 months for an internship. I explored the area extensively, from Weiße Siedlung up to Kotti. I used the U8 2-3 times every day to get to work and meet with friends, never got groped, harassed, attacked, insulted or even looked at weirdly (although the drunk party guys on Friday/Saturday night were annoying).  


The people on the U8 (and Neukölln) are an illustrious mix of hipsters, Arab &amp; Turkish gangster bros, old Berlin grandmas, students, blue-collar workers, drunk hobos and tourists. If you would make me guess I'd say about 30-50% of people I saw in Neukölln were Arab/Turkish. My mother visited me for a week and I walked down Karl-Marx-Straße with her, and showed her the historic core of Neukölln and the [Körnerpark](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%B6rnerpark#/media/File:Berlin-Neuk%C3%B6lln_K%C3%B6rnerpark_Richtung_Wassertreppe.jpg), she loved it.

The Party's involved were Marxist/Anarchist who had little time for bourgeoisie democracy and had no intention of setting up a liberal representative democracy. There radicalism and unwillingness to compromise terrified the right which led to the African Generals invasion. By 1937 any chance of democracy on left or right was over.

5450,"&gt; In the case that there WAS a chemical attack: why would even Assad do that when he's about to win the war?

Douma is the largest city in Eastern Ghouta, a sprawling suburb to the north-east of Damascus which has been a hotbed of rebel activity. 

Douma was controlled by the Jaish al-Islam rebels, who for months had been in negotiations to withdraw and turn the city over to Assad. The sticking point was that the government wanted them to withdraw *and* give up their weapons, while the rebels wanted to keep them.

The chemical attack broke their resolve. Chemical weapons are terrifying: unlike with explosive shells, it's not enough to dig in and reinforce, they'll get you anyway. Sarin is odorless and colorless, you don't know it's there until people start showing symptoms. It's not a pretty death either.

The rebels agreed to the government offer, gave up their weapons and withdrew. The siege was ended without any further expense of blood or materiel. A message was also sent to the other holdouts, about the fortunes of those who refuse government offers.

For all of this, what price does Assad pay? not much at all. The Western reaction of bombing suspected chemical warfare sites  is several steps down from anything that would scare Assad. As you said, he's winning, and the West doesn't seem to be able to stomach doing what it would take to change that reality. He'll wait some other months and, if necessary, he'll do it again.",Italy,/r/europe/comments/8c6x3j/megathread_us_uk_and_france_launch_military/dxd163z/,Rabdomante,1523727728
5451,"&gt; I find the timing extremely odd, the reasons very weak, and the justification that was heard before many times. 

Fair enough, that's your opinion...

&gt; But please lets not pretend this is France and UK helping people in need around the world in some kind of rescue mission. 

No, of course not. I 100% agree with you on that. But let's also not pretend that these strikes were necessarily motivated by a machiavellian ""We want to control the middle east mouahahaha"".

Amongst the motivations to consider we also have:

- Allowing a regime to casually use WMDs as part of normal warfare, like Assad appears to be doing, without retaliating runs the risk of normalizing the use of such weapons, which is not good for any state, no matter how involved it is in Syria. It's in everybody's interest to make sure the Geneva convention and the various treaties concerning chemical weapons are respected, and that breaking them shouldn't be something you can just do without facing retaliation.

- Having chemical weapons around is dangerous: they are easy to use and can seriously harm an absurd amount of people (Just look at the Tokyo subway sarin attack). Making sure there are as little chemical weapons going around in general, especially in the mess which is the middle east, is in the interest of the nations involved there.

- ""Saving innocent women and orphans"" makes the military and state look good within it's borders.

- It's sending a strong message to Russia, that the states involved in these strikes aren't afraid of it. For the UK this is especially important with the Sergueï Skripal mess.

- It's hurting the Assad regime, so yes of course there's political motivation, as you said.",France,/r/europe/comments/8c47xx/bbc_news_us_allies_launch_strikes_on_syria/dxd16j3/,karmaecrivain94,1523727740

First of all you're not going to be ready to invade a country in 30 days no matter what. It takes months of preparation which gives you more than ample time to debate whether you should be invading at all. And even if it does allow the targeted nation do prepare so what? If you think they're worth invading then you should be willing to suffer the casualties that come from doing it properly and in a fully democratically accountable way. If you're not then you have no business invading anyone or anything anyway.

But this is not even an invasion this is a bombing run with your existing force structure in the region. Against an opponent that is more than aware of your intentions and as prepared now as they will be later.

This created the justification for Imperial antics. France, Britain and Spain have the largest empires and as such a large part of the world speaks English, French and Spanish.

The US was an English speaking colony that became extremely powerful extremely quickly (mostly as a result of slave labour in an environment suited to growing cash crops). The US then seized a number of Spanish holdings (remember the maine?).

The scramble for Africa happened before the Spanish -American war and stuck Africa (a huge landmass) speaking English, French, Dutch (later a variant called Afrikaans) and German. 

Britain and France were the European powers that came out on top after WW2, hence they expect everyone to speak English or French wherever they go in Europe. 

The US won the war in the Pacific, and occupied Japan, hence knowledge of English becomes important.

The USSR collapses leading the NATO countries (English as their lingua franca) to believe that they have ""won"" the Cold War. Therfore Western European culture(including the US) comes out reassured in their cultural dominance. 

The leader of NATO (the US) happens to speak English so now the world is expected to.

Tl;dr: culture wars and the results of the 20th century are what leads English speakers to believe that everyone should speak English. 

Edit: ""European ideas of superiority"" refers to the manner in which European nations define themselves in regards to other nations. You wouldn't say your neighbour is better than you, because it implies that you're worse.

Edit 2: I've forgotten Asia and South America (shows how Eurocentric I am). Basically English is important because of India and several wars with Chinese nations leading to the creation of British territories like Hong Kong.

South America is predominantly Spanish/Portuguese because of the decimation to the native population. As such, few people speak native South/ mesoamerican languages anymore.",,/r/europe/comments/8c5nnc/spanish_woman_attacked_in_london_subway_for/dxcuh10/,Flyingscorpions,1523720246

5590,"Oh, Berlin. What is Berlin? Berlin, as a city, brings nothing but shame to Germany on the international stage. When comparing Berlin with other European capitals such as London, Paris, Madrid and Amsterdam, any decent human’s face must blush in humiliation. Even small countries like Austria, Belgium or Switzerland have Vienna, Brussels and Zurich: presentable cities, complete with high standards of living. Germany gets punished with Berlin, capital of losers. In all the republic, Berlin is home to the largest number of arseholes by far. Deutsche Bahn, Bundestag, Air Berlin and Axel Springer are but a few examples of all the incompetent scum being kept here. Glorious times have long since passed, the city is face down in the dirt. Berliners are lazy sods to their very core. Traits that would, in any civilised culture, pass for nothing but laziness, rudeness, incompetence, dissocial personality disorder or idiocy, are taken by the Berliner and declared a way of life. That is why the Berliner harbours intense feelings of hatred for anyone who’s better than him in any way. Especially the all-around superior Southern Germany are a thorn in his side. He envies their success, and Munich makes the top on his list of hatred. That city is – and has! – everything that Berlin wants to be and have. Berliners take no interest in the fact that it is Munich that finances their dissolute lifestyle, in fact, they secretly believe that they have earned it. So instead of freeing themselves from their envious and resentful lethargy, instead of rolling up their sleeves and improve their city, they revel in their antisocial freeloading and praise their so-called global city. Culturally, Berliners are set up rather weakly, great works lie far back in history. Moreover, mispronouncing “g” as “j” is considered a great cultural feat. Advanced students have mastered ending each and every sentence with a “wa?”. The city’s culinary performance is second-rate. Here, a sausage made from glued-together, meaty odds and ends adorned with ketchup and curry powder is sold as a culinary masterpiece. Hardly any reasonable person would consider a bratwurst with ketchup a recipe, let alone the holy grail of culinary arts. Yet, in their magnanimity, the rest of the republic lets the Berliner keep his delusion, not wanting to amplify his inferiority complex. Economically, Berlin is an utter disaster, even the late GDR stood on more solid ground. The local economy is based around alternative blogs, something-something-media and, if universities are to be believed, gender studies. Disregarding his own bankruptcy, the Berliner treats himself to prestigious projects like the city palace and the airport – which, considering its inoperative nature, is likely an art installation. Moreover, the city houses all popular parties’ headquarters, who refrain from using “traitors” in their official names (Probably for marketing reasons). For the longest time, this “town’s” “mayor”, the jolly Wowibear, butchered anything he found left in a presentable state. Long story short: Berlin is Germany’s tiled coffee table. It is to Germany what Greece is to the European Union, and if it had open sewerage, it would be Germanys Romania. Berlin is a blemish, the abscess on the arse of the nation. Berlin is the uninvited party guest, who didn’t even bring any booze and wouldn’t even understand he’s not welcome if he had is teeth beaten out and got thrown down the stairs. Berlin is the Detroit of Germany and should be sold to Poland for 200 Złoty.",,/r/europe/comments/8c68t6/berlin_in_july_1945_color_footage/dxcol2i/,thephilosophicaldog,1523712763

“What has occurred in Syria in recent days goes far beyond the constant violation of cease fires. The response to these atrocities is legitimate and proportionate.” - Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy.

___

“This was a limited and targeted action to strike the capacity of building or diffusing chemical arms. It cannot and should not be the start of an escalation.” - Italian Premier Paolo Gentiloni.

___

“The strike against the Syrian regime that uses chemical weapons to attack the civilian population was inevitable.” - Acting Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis.

___

“We support the fact that our U.S., UK and French allies took on responsibility in this way as permanent members of the U.N. Security Council. The military strike was necessary and appropriate in order to preserve the effectiveness of the international ban on the use of chemical weapons and to warn the Syrian regime against further violations.” - German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

“Belgium strongly condemns all use of chemical weapons which are a blatant violation of international law. Belgium therefore understands the military action in Syria of our American, French and British partners who have targeted identified production facilities.” - Belgian government statement

Yeah sure. But his theories can't work without big government and is reason why you had those in communism.

Stop painting him as this peaceful guy. What he wrote directly tells people to overthrow current status by means of revolution.

&gt;You confuse authoritarian marxist-leninism with antiauthoritarian socialism

You are using therms created to wash away faults and failtures of his theories so that you can say ""it was wrong interpretation and this is why it didn't work"".

There was no doctrine on what to implement or not. Various nations took his teaching and tried to implement all of his teachings.

Variety comes from lacks in theory aka things he didn't predict because his theories were shit so other thinkers had to fill up gaps themselves.

Like case of ""takes means of production"" Marx doesn't say how (probably because he feared he will be killed if he stated it explicitly) but only way to put that in theory IS revolution.

Fair point, but as you say, that's already happened in much worse scenarios. I'd even add Iraq to that list.

Compared to the current standards, this was harmless and motivated by a very specific thing, the usage of chemical weapons. Which, frankly, actually works as a justification in my eye. This shit can't ever be acceptable.

&gt; Just as support for anti-Assad militant factions has only prolonged the conflict and cost thousands more lives rather than ending it.

I'm not so sure in that regard, why would that be?

Lets keep in mind that this failure named Assad caused the civil war in the first place, and this goes on since 2011. He would've been done if not for Russian support. The origins of the protest were liberal, even if a lot of Islamists jumped on the train and then ISIS joined. The conflict between Assad and Kurds, the latter being the primary faction being armed by the US, was pretty limited. 

In fact, the Kurds were more effective against ISIS than even Assad, who had struggled a lot; so much that you might argue that without US support for the Kurds the war against ISIS would've been longer. And the general, western bombing campaigns almost purely targeted ISIS. I don't think there were intentional attacks against Assad, besides the chem weapon retaliations? So why would they do anything but make the victory against ISIS more straightforward?

At least as long as there isn't a big fallout between Assad and Kurds, in that case all bets are off. But if they managed to get an autonomous, more liberal pocket in Syria, that's the best that could happen to the people.

5716,"Today in Olbia took place a conference on the future of fishing in Sardinia, in light of the recent developments in the local and international markets. The meeting – called “the fishing sector in Sardinia. State of the art and prospects” – was organised by the *Gruppi di azione costiera* [groups of costal action] (*Flag Sardegna orientale* and *Flag sud occidentale*), in collaboration with the regional agency *Laore* the *AMA* (*Associazione mediterranea acquacoltori), [Mediterranean association of acquaculture] the *API* (*associazione piscicoltori italiani*) [italian association of fish farmers] and the Comune [city administration]. At the meeting also took part the major operators of the market and the regional assessor for agriculture, Pier Ligi Caria, and the vice president of European Parliament’s fishing commission, Renata Briano. “we can define today’s meeting as some sort of states general of fishing in Sardinia” said Caria, at the start of his speech “the normalisation of Olbia’s mussel farming, reached last year by this regional governament with the concessions given to the local operators reunited in consortium, has favoured a sector stabilisation that was waited for years”, he added.

The assessor then talked about the future of fishing in the isalnd and of the regional governament’s help in the sector: “in the new FEAMP programme we have a fund of 36 million euros and we have shown that we want to change course compared to the past. With the 25 calls launched by the regional ministry 25 million euros have been allocated with financing requests that go over 21 million euros. We have worked together with the operators to make interventions that would garantee free enterprise and the safeguard of the product: from sea urchins to sea cocumbers and coral”. “it’s true that on sea urchins and lobsters we have more tight rules than compared to the rest of Italy, but maybe this has allowed us to protect those species that are dissapearing in other seas”, he concluded.

All the numbers of sardinian fishing 

With 1709 kilometers of perimeter Sardinia is the italian region with the longest shoreline, 21,6% of the national total, and it is the third for number of vessels, with around 1350. According to the sardinian chambers of commerce, there are around 4500 workers in the isalnd’s sector that go over 12 thousand workers when considering all of the releted industries. [Sardinian fishermen also work on just under 9 thousands acres of productive lagoons.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOmNWL5nzE4) In these surfaces is produce much of the island’s excellence: from mussels to crustaceans, mullets, sea basses, sea breams and eels.

5762,"&gt; Fair point, but as you say, that's already happened in much worse scenarios. I'd even add Iraq to that list.
&gt; 

&gt; Compared to the current standards, this was harmless and motivated by a very specific thing

Yes, there absolutely are worse examples but any additional case that you add to the chain only makes it easier for others to take it and run away with it.  

If you do something one time you can point it out as an exception, a mistake of the people who did it at the time, something problematic, etc. If you keep doing it over and over and over again then that ceases to be an option as it becomes the new normal. Chemical attacks of dubious origin are a lot further from becoming that kind of norm than bombing and invading countries left and right. And as a result it's the latter where I see the greatest danger, not to mention the fact that these interventions haven't saved but destroyed millions of lives on top of it too.

&gt; Lets keep in mind that this failure named Assad caused the civil war in the first place

It's really not as simple as that, because a conflict of this magnitude has more contributing factors than a singular initial cause. It has to be kept running and with that, you can already see how there are plenty of outside factors doing as much if not more than Assad himself to maintain the chaos.

Don't get me wrong, Assad **is** a shithead of a murderous dictator, but it's still his and not our country and without outside intervention and support on the side of the militants he'd have subdued the fighting years ago, as authoritarian regimes tend to do. There are plenty of other regimes of that kind that we have no trouble at all abiding.

&gt; Lets not yield to the cowardice of advocating dictators just for the sake of stability.

We do all the time. Let's not undermine international order and regional stability and waste away millions of lives by toppling every single dictator. The US, for example, supports some 70% of the world's dictatorships.

Sorry but this is not true, many sources (from doctors on the hospital to military personnel) have claimed there were not victims of chemical attacks, some doctors claimed many unknown individuals stormed the hospital creating panic giving water to everybody yelling that everybody was at risk of some poison gas in the area while others were carrying cameras. The images only show babies crying and people throwing water at them in a chaotic situation with lots of panic.

Sure, everyone gave them the benefit of the doubt the first time and got them to promise to destroy the stockpiles so that it wouldn't happen again.

""It is believed that the settlement was founded in the 6th century AD by Focko, a Bavarian nobleman. [...] The existence of the village was documented for the first time in 1070, and historical records show that some twenty years later, the lord was recorded in Latin as Adalpertus de Fucingin. The spelling of the name has evolved over the years; it is first recorded in historical sources with the spelling as Vucchingen in 1070, Fukching in 1303, Fugkhing in 1532, and in the modern spelling Fucking in the 18th century, which is pronounced with the vowel oo as in book. The ending -ing is an old Germanic suffix indicating the people belonging to the root word to which it is attached, thus Fucking means '(place of) Focko's people.'""

Uh huh.  So if everyone else in the periphery started on the goal of emulating Germany and strove for domestic wage repression and balanced budgets as well as export surpluses, nothing would change?  Nothing right?  

So keeping in mind that one person's (or nation's) surplus is necessarily another's deficit, how can all of the periphery *and* Germany run surpluses all at the same time against each other?  In fact, it quite impossible (fallacy of composition).  Germany relies - as this picture aptly demonstrates - on the rest of the union and especially the periphery running deficits vis-a-vis Germany in order to buy its stuff.

Spoiler alert: It's not america.

So now, rather than improving the situation, dire as it may be (which it is!), it goes from bad to worse. Just a matter of time until Damascus is burning, and then what? Another country to add to the list of countries that have been fucked over by americans.

Doesn't matter, because France has an entirely different government to the one it had in 2003, and France has been eager to bomb Syria since 2013 (they didn't because the British parliament voted against it, remember that?), and was, along with the UK, responsible for the mess in Libya today.
