https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irony#Situational_irony

&gt; Situational irony is a relatively modern use of the term, and describes a sharp discrepancy between the expected result and actual results in a certain situation.
&gt;
&gt;Lars Elleström writes:
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Situational irony ... is most broadly defined as a situation where the outcome is incongruous with what was expected, but it is also more generally understood as a situation that includes contradictions or sharp contrasts.[31] 

https://grammarist.com/usage/ironic/

&gt; A less accepted but longstanding definition of *ironic* is *markedly different from what was expected*. This is where *ironic* starts to rankle some people. But while this sense of *ironic* is more questionable than the original, it’s so widespread that we have to accept it. It’s even common in edited writing—for example:
&gt;
&gt;&gt;It’s sad and ironic that wranglings over abortion should in any way impede action that could save babies’ lives. [Guardian]
&gt;
&gt;&gt;There’s something ironic, in a limited sense, in the man’s moving to the suburbs and hurting himself on his own lawn. [Children’s Literature, Seth Lehrer]
&gt;
&gt;&gt;It may seem ironic that workers in a nominally Communist country don’t have the right to strike. [New York Times]

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214629618300598

""Contrary to a persistent myth based on erroneous methods, global data show that renewable electricity adds output and saves carbon faster than nuclear power does or ever has.""

It is also not remotely economical, as of the latest LCOE (levelized cost of energy) nuclear is over 3x more expensive than wind and solar. This means a given dollar figure of investment will give 3x as much decarbonization if invested into wind and solar instead of nuclear.

https://www.lazard.com/media/450436/rehcd3.jpg

Nuclear has never even been economically viable, it is never been done, anywhere without massive government support:

""Most revealing is the fact that nowhere in the world, where there is a competitive market for electricity, has even one single nuclear power plant been initiated. Only where the government or the consumer takes the risks of cost overruns and delays is nuclear power even being considered.""

https://www.worldnuclearreport.org/IMG/pdf/20170912wnisr2017-en-lr.pdf#Report%202017%20V5.indd%3A.30224%3A7746

renewables are subsidized less:

https://htpr.cnet.com/p/?u=http://i.bnet.com/blogs/subsidies-2.bmp&amp;h=Y8-1SgM_eMRp5d2VOBmNBw

And after all the subsidies nuclear has received, it is still not viable without subsidies, meanwhile wind and solar have many examples of subsidy-free projects

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-14/subsidy-free-wind-power-possible-in-2-7-billion-dutch-auction

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2018/10/31/more-subsidy-free-solar-storage-for-the-uk/

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/subsidy-free-solar-comes-to-the-uk

With the overall lower subsidies to the renewables industry, they have transitioned to being viable without in a very short period of time, compared to nukes which literally remain subsidy junkies 50 years after their first suckle at the government teat.

Renewables even make better use of subsidy dollars; the same amount of subsidy invested in renewables vs nuclear will give many times more energy as a result.

https://imgur.com/a/dcPVyt7

""Global reported investment for the construction of the four commercial nuclear reactor projects (excluding the demonstration CFR-600 in China) started in 2017 is nearly US$16 billion for about 4 GW. This compares to US$280 billion renewable energy investment, including over US$100 billion in wind power and US$160 billion in solar photovoltaics (PV). China alone invested US$126 billion, over 40 times as much as in 2004. Mexico and Sweden enter the Top-Ten investors for the first time. A significant boost to renewables investment was also given in Australia (x 1.6) and Mexico (x 9). Global investment decisions on new commercial nuclear power plants of about US$16 billion remain a factor of 8 below the investments in renewables in China alone. ""

p22 of https://www.worldnuclearreport.org/IMG/pdf/20180902wnisr2018-lr.pdf

meanwhile, a study on nuclear economics show:

https://www.diw.de/documents/publikationen/73/diw_01.c.670581.de/dwr-19-30-1.pdf

and summarized here

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2019/07/24/nuclear-a-poor-investment-strategy-for-clean-energy/

""The economic history and financial analyses carried out at DIW Berlin show that nuclear energy has always been unprofitable in the private economy and will remain so in the future. Between 1951 and 2017, none of the 674 nuclear reactors built was done so with private capital under competitive conditions. Large state subsidies were used in the cases where private capital flowed into financing the nuclear industry. The post-war period did not witness a transition from the military nuclear industry to commercial use, and the boom in state-financed nuclear power plants soon fizzled out in the 1960s. Financial investment calculations confirmed the trend: investing in a new nuclear power plant leads to average losses of around five billion euros.""

The results of this is that in 2017 there was over 150 GW of wind and solar coming online, but nuclear:

""New nuclear capacity of 3.3 gigawatts (GW) in 2017 was outweighed by lost capacity of 4.6 GW.""

https://energypost.eu/nuclear-power-in-crisis-welcome-to-the-era-of-nuclear-decommissioning/

Renewable energy is doing more for decarbonization than nuclear.

Now the inevitable response is ""muh storage"" but

Renewables+ compressed air storage is already cheaper than nuclear

https://www.rechargenews.com/transition/1821297/liquid-air-storage-offers-cheapest-route-to-24-hour-wind-and-solar

""“For a 100MW system, we are already touching [a levelized cost of storage (LCOS) of] $100 per MWh today,” chief executive Javier Cavada tells Recharge. “In ten years from now, I can see that being $50/MWh. That's very doable.”

By comparison, a new pumped-hydro plant would have an LCOS of $152-198 per MWh, with a comparable lithium-ion system costing $285-581/MWh, according to analyst Lazard.

With a new gas-peaker plant having a levelized cost of energy of $156-210/MWh, and wind power at $30-60/MWh (according to Lazard), it may already cheaper to balance the grid using wind-powered liquid-air storage than fossil-fuel technology. And if the LAES system is “charged” using wind power that would otherwise be curtailed, the wholesale price of that power would be close to zero.""

So we already have renewable+storage that is cheaper than nuclear.

Nuclear does not even work as a compliment to renewable energy.

It is a myth that a baseload generator like nuclear, ie something that makes a continuous output, is needed with VRE (variable renewable energy).

What you need is something capable of quick ramping up to fill in the gaps when no sun or wind. (batteries, Hydrogen, gas)

Nuclear is already expensive, and if wind and solar are cheaper 50% of the day (when there is wind or solar essentially), that means one would only need nuclear to provide ""baseload"" 50% of the time.

Except nuclear price is made up of initial capex more than fuel costs, so turning off a nuclear plant for when it is needed does not save money. What it means is it now has only 50% of the time to make the same money as before, so the price now doubles to the customer. Which is why nuclear will never fill the gaps in renewable energy, it is already expensive, and will only get more expensive the more renewables come online

Nuclear is a square peg for the round holes in the future energy grid.

Its decline will continue

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2019/07/24/nuclear-a-poor-investment-strategy-for-clean-energy/

""The economic history and financial analyses carried out at DIW Berlin show that nuclear energy has always been unprofitable in the private economy and will remain so in the future. Between 1951 and 2017, none of the 674 nuclear reactors built was done so with private capital under competitive conditions. Large state subsidies were used in the cases where private capital flowed into financing the nuclear industry. The post-war period did not witness a transition from the military nuclear industry to commercial use, and the boom in state-financed nuclear power plants soon fizzled out in the 1960s. Financial investment calculations confirmed the trend: investing in a new nuclear power plant leads to average losses of around five billion euros.""",,/r/europe/comments/d96dfq/you_can_spend_a_dollar_a_euro_a_forint_or_a_ruble/f1gjuy2/,Zealousideal_Swimmer,1569468892

[RT's got some video of Lukashenko and his son doing a PR video showing them manually-harvesting potatoes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AV8lz8Tq_w).  They've also got some sort of dinky tractor thing, but it looks like that just brings the potatoes up to the surface, dumps the soil off, and then plops the potatoes on the ground to make them easier to see and pick up.

*looks further*

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potato_harvester

&gt;Types
&gt;
&gt;Potato spinner
&gt;
&gt; A potato spinner is connected to a tractor through the three-point linkage. Older machines were drawn by horse and were driven by a ground drive. It works by a flat piece of metal which runs horizontal to the ground lifting the potatoes up and a large wheel with spokes on it called a reel pushing the clay and potatoes out to the side. The potatoes are then gathered by hand, placed into containers and transported from the field for further packaging.
&gt;
&gt; The potato spinner is becoming obsolete because modern potato harvesting equipment eliminates manual gathering of potatoes and leaves fewer potatoes in the soil. 

I guess that's what it is.

97,"When done by the government, a tariff and boycott can be the same thing. America did not sanction and embargo South Africa, they applied a tariff in order to add financial pressure as a form of boycotting.

So nice try, your condescending attitude has backfired. Word of the wise, you can be arrogant only if you're correct, otherwise it's pathetic and insufferable.

You have yet to actually respond to any of my points in good faith and have been overall rather rude, despite there not being any occasion to do so. I have not been condescending or rude towards you in the slightest, I have made straight forward comments defending my views, and you have yet to genuinely respond to a singular claim with anything else than a straw man. Here are my claims:

1. The Tariffs, while adding unpredictability to the markets, are not financially that big of a deal. Therefore any claim of ""recession"" is overrblown hyperbole. It is more accurate to say that these tariffs will slow down growth from say 3% to 2%, rather than say that ""OMG the market is going to crash by 40% tomorrow""

2. Unlimited economic growth at all costs is not a good thing. We have implemented regulations and bans for the sake of society numerous times. Therefore, even though no one ""wins"" a trade war economically, there are still good reasons to apply economic pressure on nations. A good example of this is when governments applied economic pressure on South Africa for the sake of ending Apartheid. 
3. China is a currency manipulator, patent stealer, and goods dumper. These are the explicit reasons president trump has given for the trade war. He has done a shit job at coalition building, and getting our allies on board with applying pressure to force China to come to the table, but at the same time, the goals of the trade war are rather rational.
4. Short term economic harm is worth it for structural reform, case in point, climate change. We need to address this issus, so even if there is lower stock growth for corporations, a good planet is necessary for a good economy. Likewise, even though China gives us cheap shit, it is healthy to fix the issue of patent stealing now vs later, even if it causes short term loss.

You can either respectfully tell me why you disagree with these positions, or you can bugger off. I will gladly ignore your previous snarkiness and have a genuine conversation about this, but if you respond one more time with a snarky strawman, there will be no response.",,/r/europe/comments/d77oj0/the_men_who_plundered_europe_bankers_on_trial_for/f1gl7he/,Lu___,1569469850

162,"You know, my first thought was ""how long can it take to determine that it's safe to slap a bomb on the thing"".

But then I thought of a few past incidents:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Midway

&gt; Simultaneously, *Yorktown*'s VB-3, commanded by Max Leslie, went for *Sōryū*, scoring at least three hits and causing extensive damage.  Some of Leslie's bombers did not have bombs as they were accidentally released when the pilots attempted to use electrical arming switches.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1967_USS_Forrestal_fire

&gt; On 29 July 1967, a fire broke out on board the aircraft carrier USS Forrestal after an electrical anomaly caused a Zuni rocket on a F-4B Phantom to fire, striking an external fuel tank of an A-4 Skyhawk. The flammable jet fuel spilled across the flight deck, ignited, and triggered a chain-reaction of explosions that killed 134 sailors and injured 161.

*googles for more*

https://www.quora.com/Has-anybody-ever-accidentally-fired-a-missile-prematurely-from-a-fighter-jet-while-still-on-the-ground

&gt; There was one such incident in 1982, during or just after the Falklands conflict: a Harrier GR.3 at HMS *Sheathbill* (the forward refuelling point established ashore) had one or both Sidewinder missiles fire uncommanded, causing eleven serious casualties among a group of troops (thankfully, I don’t think any killed).
&gt;
&gt; The Falklands invasion, by those who were there
&gt;
&gt; A claimed eyewitness statement - “One day I took the Squadron cine camera out on to the airfield to get some footage for the record. It was snowing and a group of soldiers was sweeping the runway with brooms. A Harrier was winding up for take off next to me. The men moved off to one side to let the aircraft go. I started to film the aeroplane as it whisked down the runway. As its nose wheel left the ground there was an almighty roar. The Harrier’s sidewinder missiles had malfunctioned and launched. The starboard missile shot off into some iso-containers to the side of the strip and exploded in a shower of sparks and flame. The port missile tore into the soldiers standing resting on their brushes. All the time I had been filming this, but I stopped now and started to run over to the soldiers. The scene was a mess. Soldiers had had limbs amputated. Others were staggering around or slumped on the ground. Fortunately, some SAS troopers, I believe, had been on the scene nearby waiting for a helicopter. They moved in quickly and started to administer first-aid and morphine. Medics arrived shortly after that, and a helicopter came in to start evacuating the injured to the hospital. It was clear that there was nothing for me to do. I walked slowly back to the Command Post feeling rather low, but presumably not as bad as the poor bastards I had just witnessed. I think the film I had taken was eventually used in the Board of Inquiry into the circumstances of the disaster.""
&gt;
&gt; Normally there’s a lot of safety mechanisms which prevent this, but one factor in the incident was that the Sidewinder fit to the GR.3 version of the Harrier was a hasty rush job for the conflict, and had not had the usual thorough testing to be sure that (for just one example) turning on the landing lights didn’t send enough of a spike into the missile’s cabling via some unexpected unshielded crosstalk to approach “fire me now!” levels.

255,"&gt;Skipping that Holocaust-y ""Albanian question"" comment

No I just think Yugoslavia should have done what the Greeks did after ww2. Deport all Albanians for their collaboration with the Nazis and Italy. Considering that the Czechs and the Poles deported almost all Germans from Sudetenland, Pommerania, Prussia and Silesia, we could have easily done the same with the Albanians in Kosovo. Instead, they recieved more autonomy than ever which just only emboldened them. Serbs have proven themselves time and again to be the most politically idiotic people in all of Europe.

&gt;give them the Presevo Valley, everyone is happier for it.

No because that's not part of Kosovo, never have been and never will be. It's also the territory where our main highway goes through so the answer from me is an definitive no. I mean what's next? Should we also give all Albanian bakeries exclave status simply because its run by Albanians? 

&gt;make an agreement about mutual religious freedoms

That's not gonna cut it. Not after the Albanians burnt and pillaged 700 years old monasteries and churches in 2004. The only reason why it hasn't happened again is because they are being guarded by KFOR troops 24/7. Otherwise the monasteries would be nothing but heaps of ruin because to them its unacceptable that Kosovo is historically Serbian land.They want to erase every single thing that reminds them of this fact. If they could, they would do the same thing the Chinese are doing to mosques and historical sites in Xinjiang. Maybe this sounds hyperbolic but based on the events of 2004, formal agreements about religious freedom don't guarantee the rights and physical safety of the Orthodox church.",Serbia,/r/europe/comments/d8lj8r/serbian_tabloids_blic_and_informer_report_on_the/f1ftts1/,Petique,1569452862

354,"&gt;As I have stated in another comment, the title is incorrect. 440 is total number of female homicide victims, not just domestic deaths.

Ah ok that makes for one hell of a difference, thanks for sharing.  

&gt;According to this source, ""12.2 out of every 100,000 women were victims of homicide"" in USA in 2016. That's approximately 60 per million.

Wikipedia says it's 5.3 per 100,000 *overall* in the USA as per my source. So that's a huuuge gap with 12.2 of every 100,000 women, especially given the fact that men are killed more. 

So how is the gap so big? 

The article you're quoting has ""security.org"" as a source. https://www.security.org/resources/american-homicides/

If you scroll down to the chart ""rate of homocide per year"" you will find that actually the stat is **2.9 per 100,000 for women**. The article you quoted is wrong. 

I can't even find how they made this mistake. There is one stat with 12 in it which states ""Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama each averaged over 12 homicides per 100,000 individuals."". Perhaps that's where they got 12.2 from? Somehow? Even then that's the overall murder rate, not woman specific. 

Interestingly enough, that same chart puts men at 13.7. Averaging out, that makes 8,4, a lot higher than the wikipedia article.",The Netherlands,/r/europe/comments/d950wn/440_pairs_of_womens_shoes_were_hung_on_one_of_the/f1fisbb/,Rolten,1569445362

357,"&gt; The law in a steadily increasing number of nations would disagree.

Well yeah, they're changing something defined in order to best satisfy people.

&gt; No it doesn't, it comes from Latin to describe being married - a legal institution/definition that has never been limited to a specific religion.

It's defined as being between a woman and a man, that's my point, and the bible AFAIK uses it a lot.                

&gt; And you do know words are created by people, and people change their definition all the time over time? Changing a definition from ""man and woman"" to ""two people"" is a pretty minor alteration for a definition to go through.

No, a new word needs to be formed. Look at e.g. the scientists, they've got a definition for everything, they don't change the definition when they discovers something new, they've discovered something new so no need to label it with an old word.             

&gt; You're making it a new term when it doesn't have to be. It's marriage, full stop.

But marriage is already a fully secular process in Germany. The marriage ceremony in church has absolutely no legal significance. It means nothing.

So how is that secular marriage in front of a government clerk in any way religious and requires protection?

Neither is marriage a Christian invention, because it has existed for centuries before Christianity or judaism were invented. As well as marriage being a concept in many completely unrelated cultures.



And same sex marriage being legal does also not force churches to required to hold same sex marriages.

That doesn't help with climate change. And it is also not sustainable long term. These plants have a certain life span, at some point they will be shut down – no matter if that happens by law or simply because it is too expensive to keep them running &amp; having to maintain them.

&gt; The bulk of CO2 production and deforestation needs to be defeated with political means.

Political means can only be successful if there is public support for such measures. And that support doesn't come from doing nothing.

&gt; The problem is that right wing politics and climate change denial need to be decoupled, convincing people already on your side has a low impact I fear.

Then you simply do not understand how politics works. You almost never have a clear cut 50/50 polarization into left/right and the goal of Fridays for Future is not only to reach left wing people, but also the center and then by extension, the right wing. Climate change denial and right wing politics can only be decoupled when the center starts to recognize climate change as the political issue it is. If that happens, Climate change denial becomes a political loser stance and the right wing (at least reasonable ones) has no choice than to change position.

I think that Slovakia is close to an even split between liberal and conservative values, the exact numbers depend on the current situation and events at the time, and the issue in question. For LGBT specifically, the reason that those who disagreed in this survey, is that there is stigma about adoptions.

Pay attention to this part:

&gt; Sixteen child petitioners – including Greta Thunberg and Alexandria Villaseñor – from 12 countries around the world today presented a landmark official complaint to the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child to protest lack of government action on the climate crisis. The child petitioners – aged between 8 to 17 – allege that Member States’ failure to tackle the climate crisis constitutes a violation of child rights. They urge the independent body to order Member States to take action to protect children from the devastating impacts of climate change.

Also this part:

&gt; Complaints filed under the CRC’s Third Optional Protocol are adjudicated upon by the Committee on the Rights of the Child – a group of independent experts. The Committee is able to receive complaints from children, groups of children or their representatives against any State that has ratified the Protocol.

This is also why the selection of countries appears so odd. Major emitters like China, the U.S., and Russia have not ratified the third protocol, and can therefore not be addressed through this petition mechanism.",,/r/europe/comments/d8yc1e/french_president_emmanuel_macron_says_greta/f1f72tl/,FblthpLives,1569438157

&gt; I can speak for Slovakia, which is the last in this list. I'm sad to see our country at that position, but I think it will get better in the future.

&gt; I think that Slovakia is close to an even split between liberal and conservative values, the exact numbers depend on the current situation and events at the time, and the issue in question. For LGBT specifically, the reason that those who disagreed in this survey, is that there is stigma about adoptions. I think a majority (not a large one) would agree with civil unions, but wouldn't approve of adoptions by homosexuals, especially among the younger generations (there are many alt-right supporters among them, too, but other than them and the strongly religious ones, most don't care).

Some questions about the EU permanent residence permit.
- What is the actual difference between this residence permit and the national ones from each country (i.e. advantages, disadvantages)? 
- If you had a EU permanent residence permit from another country (e.g. Greece) and you wanted to immigrate to the Netherlands, would the immigration procedure change? What kind of procedure would be done? What happens to the EU permit from the previous country?
- Do you think that this scheme has accomplished the purposed objectives, or do you think that improvements need to be made in the law (or if changes are already being done)? 

Regarding the EU Blue Card residence permit. I’ve seen that there’s a high disbalance between the countries giving this kind of permit (especially Netherlands vs Germany). Some time ago I remember reading that there would be changes in this residence permit but I haven’t heard anything new.

772,"Definition: 

&gt; The job vacancy rate (JVR) measures the proportion of total posts that are vacant, expressed as a percentage: JVR = (number of job vacancies) / (number of occupied posts + number of job vacancies). 

&gt; A job vacancy is defined as a paid post (newly created, unoccupied or about to become vacant) for which the employer is taking active steps to find a suitable candidate from outside the enterprise concerned and is prepared to take more steps and which the employer intends to fill either immediately or in the near future. Under this definition, a job vacancy should be open to candidates from outside an enterprise. However, this does not exclude the possibility of the employer recruiting an internal candidate for the post. A vacant post that is open only to internal candidates should not be treated as a job vacancy. An occupied post is a paid post within an organisation to which an employee has been assigned.

832,"I already explained why the court's judgement was so political/partial and has nothing to with ""preserving democracy"". Let's discuss your other points:

1. I don't care who else uses my argument and whether you support that other person or not. Please do not disqualify my argument based on that.

2. Negotiating with the EU and managing Brexit is the role of the government not parliament. Parliament legislates, the government executes. Parliament hasn't been legislating anything and now thanks to the court's judgement it seems like the government also can't execute or effectively negotiate anything.

3. Do a quick google about prorogation in the UK for a full list of controversial prorogations.

4. Are you saying parliament has been waiting the last 3 years to propose and legislate on things EXACTLY during the 5 weeks that it was prorogued? Just rewind a few weeks and you surely must remember there wasn't a single new parliamentary proposal expected or to be discussed. The 5 week period was not a particular crisis any different than the previous 3 years or at the very least the last year. Now Labour cancelled their convention, funny. Before the whole prorogation thing happened it was still scheduled to happen (and not be cancelled).

5. There was just enough time after prorogation to vote on a deal exit, a no-deal exit and maybe even on no exit at all (but not enough time for endless obstruction and sabotage of the negotiations which is what I suspect you support). And you have to have seen that the government doesn't even control anymore what gets debated.

6. I never claimed parliament lost its right to anything. Prorogation is a normal lawful procedure at the disposal of the PM / Monarch. They lost the ability to obstruct and sabotage for only 5 weeks... specially when they couldn't even agree on a new general election to at least ATTEMPT to break their obstruction and sabotage.

7. It's very normal in such a political court ruling of a very high court for the dissenting members to join in to preserve whatever is left of the legitimacy of the institution that they also make part of.

So you have a PM with no democratic mandate being accused of unlawfulness by an unelected court for doing what every other PM has done although in this case it would have stopped the sabotage and obstruction of a deadlocked parliament that refuses to renew itself with a new election, in order to push through the line what the people want since 3 years ago.",,/r/europe/comments/d8kv4n/suspending_parliament_was_unlawful_court_rules/f1e1gs1/,antiniche,1569409429

893,"&gt; He has billions because he owns a part of every singe amazon truck data center etc not because he lives in a mountain of $ bills

He can still sell his shares (and possibly damage the company) and the statement would still hold true. 

&gt; how has Bezos starting Amazon and providing services to the world made the world worse off?

It has made the world worse of in the context of how his bussines ethics affect his workers. They are humans like you and me. Why should they be treated like numbers? The work the people in the logistic centers have to put in is way worse than it is advertised as. A woman having a broken foot and being told they cannot call an ambulance  and should instead just take an ibuprofen or risk being reprimanded or fired directly is not ok. It is far from that. (source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FEWJJHEmk0)
On the other hand you have Amazon taking taking tax loopholes and avoiding to pay a single penny (embellished of course) in taxes in the EU. The delivery trucks use the same roads as delivery trucks of local companies, their workers come from the same neighborhoods as smaller companies and still they refuse to pay the same percentage in taxes. Taxes that are being used to develop the countries and further us as nations, unions - as humans. How are we supposed to grow as a society when the only lubricant for construction, R&amp;D and healthcare is not being distributed fairly? Amazone uses the roads significantly more that others? Of course they should pay more to keep them up. The percentage of the taxes stay the same or change only in certain margins. Who pays the roadworkers for the repair of streets? The Government. And last I checked we weren't living in world government under the Rule of Jeff Bezos or his executive board. But considering how much money they put into lobbying and trying to pay off government officials I'd say they're at least trying to get there.",,/r/europe/comments/d8yc1e/french_president_emmanuel_macron_says_greta/f1e28ul/,Jonnyjoh,1569410262

To supplement other replies, the SCUK *ratio decidendi* was based solely on *this* prorogation's effect of compromising Parliament's constitutional role, and expressly didn't consider BJ's motivations.

It is therefore not impossible for BJ to prorogue again provided he does so for proper purpose and does not frustrate Parliament's supervisory role.  Chances are, therefore, any new prorogation would be short and largely pointless (other than its proper function of introducing a Queen's Speech to set out a new domestic agenda).

Had BJ limited its timing and purpose to those ends, the ones he stated in the first place, it likely would never have gone to court because any disturbance it caused would have been *de minimis*.",,/r/europe/comments/d8kv4n/suspending_parliament_was_unlawful_court_rules/f1dvmtc/,StrixTechnica,1569401790

People radicalize in echo-chambers and often the most extreme one is the ""leader"" who gets to decide what their ""faith"" (for lack of a better word, since reason has been long gone by then) is going to be. So what the rest of us end up hearing is some drivel about personal grudges someone holds combined with over the top demands of the original idea.

I know the usual  ""BROAAAAAAH  SOVEREIGNTY !"" comes up and takes over any serious talk about shared forces but from an economical standpoint it makes perfect sense. Shared costs allow for an overall more efficient and modern military for everyone.

This goes beyond the military. Currently France supplies most of its neighbors in airborne firefighting capabilities, Belgium has helicopter with buckets but has to call France for anything bigger like a Canadair. They get payment in return but they still have to cover for maintenance and operation costs.

Why wouldn't they or anyone want a EU based Civil protection platform providing heavy an or expensive equipment? In the current system, countries provide their own equipment and and there is a EU led crowdfunding for transportation and operation.

In a Union with increasingly homogeneous customs system, why does every single country need a whole customs department? Just put a strengthened Frontex on the job, who'd be staffed by agents from all over the EU, with a shared experience and a better understanding of global smuggling routes, all that for a fraction of the cost of operating on a national level in every single country.

As for transparency, I'd much rather have a EU Intelligence Center in charge of Passenger Name Records, with your name being recorder in ONE record and managed by ONE entity, and with joint oversight, than having the current system, where every single EU member does its own flavor of PNR, with your own whole personal file in every single country you step into, doing god knows what with the data.

1001,"This is a borderline impossible topic to poll and you are either naive or biased if you don't see why. The 'personal ideal number of children' answer is one that coming from a place of daydreaming if you poll a 15-year-old, or one of personal regrets of all kinds if you ask a 60-year-old. It's also affected by the current family size as the answer will be adjusted according to that. 

If anything, the only interesting group would be those barely removed from childbearing age, those in their 40s, but still potential hurdles make it nigh impossible to determine a real figure. 

But what's certain is that thinking the ideal-actual gap can be closed is extremely naive. It's life that gets in the way, and not just financing. Save for indoctrinating women to be as servile and obedient as they were centuries ago, the stress of everyday life, disappointments in the romantic partner, unexpected illnesses or other major problems, will always maintain a gap between ideal and actual number of children. The OECD file actually relies on the 2011 Eurobarometer for the data, which found that gap to be around 0.3-0.4. That's normal and realistic.

2. Armaments. Air assets need to return to base to take on further bombs/missiles. There's a huge difference between being able to re-arm in 1 hour vs. 4 hours.

3. Sortie rate. In any serious military confrontation, you need to be able to maintain intensity of operations over an extended period of time.

1089,"By developping our own flavour of Union Owned Enterprises ?

Honestly, we have room for this.

China's economy started to thrieve in the late 1970s when they departed from SOE-only, and started to introduce a controled measure of free enterprise and free trade, while retaining the SOE model for strategic sectors such as energy, infrastructures and banks.

On the other hand, we did build the Union starting from a hodgepodgery of models and the free market may have been indeed the fastest track to the unified market we now enjoy. It may be time however that we take time to pause and consider where we now stand and where we are going.

There may be a number of industrial sectors where the free-market model is not the most efficient.

One such sector is electricity.


Electricity is not your ordinary merchandise. It requires huge, long-term invesments and can be distributed only via a dedicated, constrained network. It is both a consumer good and a strategic backbone. It has this unique logistic requirement that it absolutely must be delivered just-in-time, being the only market where production must always and at all time exactly match consumption, the only market where storage is not an option. No other commercial product is as sensitive to fast-changing meteorogical conditions, obviously for consumption but sometimes also for production.

The carbon footprint and the climate impact of electricity varies greatly according to local conditions, from Norwegian Queen Water to Polish King Coal, and it is high-time that we envision a continent-wide approach on this subject.

Other sectors could greatly benefit from adjusting away from our current competition-only dogma : railways, and generally transportations, military procurement ...

So, instead of lambasting Chinese companies as unfair competition, maybe we could ponder what could be learnt from them.",European Union,/r/europe/comments/d8lrch/european_firms_urge_eu_to_take_defensive_measures/f1dr4t9/,Neker,1569395532

1095,"&gt;How are they beneficial to Russia? Do you think that they would control such lanes? 

You know you can just google this and find out for yourself, right? I thought you had the authority to just ignore these points to make your own point. *Now* you are asking questions? I'll give you a starting point on the viability of that lane:

https://www.ft.com/content/2fa82760-5c4a-11e9-939a-341f5ada9d40

https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/29/russia-china-climate-change-1691698

&gt;Yes if the only effect of global warming was no ice in the arctic the new lanes would cause an economic upturn. I hope those northern Russian harbors do not exist at the moment or they are going to need replacement.

You'd think a country that is actively investing and preparing for climate change would take rising sea levels into account, right?

Also, as I said above. This is a cost-benefit calculation. But only for Russia. People like Putin would sacrifice a lot, but they wouldn't go as far as destroying their own base over it. I agree that they may have figured out that the economic upsides may be lower than the downsides after all, but if the only question was ""thousands of refugees flee third world countries"" vs. ""Russia gets some new shipping lanes"", you can bet your ass Putin wouldn't think about the humanitarian aspect of climate change first.

&gt;Yes the UN called it the most destroyed city in the world. Yet the world did not care. Because it was Chechnya, just like the world does not really care about Crimea or Syria etc. Or Iraq or Afghanistan. These are 3rd world countries getting hurt. 

So we are just ignoring that you didn't know what you were talking about here? Alright. This argument isn't about other caring either. It's about whether Russian leaders have the potential to do such things like massacring civilians just to get a point across. And the latest Russian leader proved this with flying colors.

&gt;Do you have a point here? The US vetoes anything regarding Palestine for example. Is it Russia bad US good? 

Nope, I think that's pretty bad too. But cool beans that you are slowly trying to shift this into a ""blame the USA"" discussion, when we were talking about Russia. A classic. It's literally impossible to criticize anything Russia did or could do, because USA also did a thing. Man, I guess I really don't have to follow the law all that much because other criminals exist.

&gt;So you have nothing but air. These bad billionaires are always including now trying to make money. They will burn the forest if it helps them make more money. But you have not shown how global warming will help them make more money.

You have outright denied it's a possibility that anyone can profit, when other people proposed arguments. 

&gt;New shipping lanes to whom? Canada? USA ? To sell Gas that might actually be tariffed to hell ? Russia will have to keep selling gas as it's their primary export (and already controversial for Germany to trade with them). They definitely do not want climate change, it fucks their exports. 

But your one dimensional and frankly amateurish assessment of the situation didn't take into account how Russia can benefit from climate change. New shipping lanes, more arable and livable land, easier access to ressources in Siberia. These are ways to make money out fromclimate change.

&gt;Russian oligarchs sure are powerful and rich but so are billionaires from the US and Europe. If you think the Russians have more clout globally your are mistaken. I don't think they have more clout than Saudi oil worldwide.

Way to shfit the argument to others again. Anything to say about the Russian oligarchs who keep trying to dismantle the EU but are more than happy to send their kids there to study? 

&gt;And they don't want global warming. They want to sell gas, they will want to keep selling gas despite global warming. But they are not pursing global warming as a strategy to improve their place in the world.

Great assessment. Do you have any soruces for that? It's funny because you probably believe that Russian Oligarchs are some sort of Oil and Gas CEOs, the lot of them. They have diversified portfolios nowadays. Oligarchs have made great transitions from selling Western products on the Black Market in the 90s to becoming bankers, tech-investors, media personalities, real estate investors and so on. These people will manage when oil and gas becomes unprofitable and shipping, farming, construction and mining are industries in which they can grow thanks to climate change.

&gt;You are wrong, while global warming will fuck up the whole planet, Russia will remain mostly frozen. Siberia is not going to turn to farmland or something. St. Petersburg will not find the warmer climate beneficial. 

I didn't say it will turn into a farmland, but it will become more habitable, that's for sure: https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/climate-change-crisis-siberia-habitable-russia-permafrost-melting-global-warming-a8946821.html

Throwing in St. Petersburg is again distracting from my actual argument. To reiterate once more, I agree with you that Russian leaders may have realized that the costs are higher than the benefits. That losing St. Petersburg may not be worth gaining new habitable land in Siberia. But that doesn't mean the economic potential in Siberia due to climate change doesn't exist.

&gt;And before claiming any imaginary benefits Russia will see it's main export being demonized and sanctioned. But somehow new shipping lanes are going to make things better for Russia.

Well, if climate change is actually combated, then gas and oil will eventually have to stop anyways. And if we fail to combat it, why would Russia get sanctioned after the fact? How lucrative these shipping lanes are is something I touched on above.

Sure, there are examples of where it'd be a major problem -- like, say that when Argentina attacked the Falklands the UK just dicked around for half a year (she didn't) and Argentina did everything possible to fortify the islands quickly (she didn't).  That might make retaking them considerably harder.

On the other hand, there are also examples of where it clearly wasn't a dominant factor.

Using regular fixed-wing aircraft carrier to combat piracy would be absolute overkill, by orders of magnitute. And since you never send carrier out there alone, you also need full carrier group. Or just send a helicarrier + destroyer, ones belonging to a member state.

&gt; I think was political call for solidarity rather than request of assets US did not have themselves. (...)

Yes, this is mostly correct diagnosis. Why only mostly? US was lacking in know-how in the ""nation (re)building"" department (task that they ultmately failed with, just as foretold by e.g. France). Which some of the EU countries have more experience with, due to being involved in such processes in some of their formed colonies. In other words: there was something US lacked and needed. Turns out, without capabilities to ""win the peace"" and without large scale European assistance, US ended where it ended regarding Iraq and Afghanistan.

&gt; would note that EU indeed lacks blatant military power and it has potential to backfire badly.

1. At this very moment EU has no means to decide what would potential EU military actually do (no common command structure and no framework to build such structure). It would require major changes or unlawfull power grab.

2. Creating EU military before building common, integrated diplomacy outside of negotiating trade deals _will_ backfire in even worse manner. Building common foregin policy would also give a very nce stick in terms of discouraging further military aggressions by Russia, which makes this necessary step also somewhat useful in the security terms.",PL /Lublin voivodship/ (please invest),/r/europe/comments/d8o6u6/germany_proposes_european_aircraft_carrier/f1difgw/,EastPoleVault,1569385235

If a war breaks out, then nobody is fleeing by private planes. That would be insane. Also, that would be a nonsensical reason to design a plane.

Any plane built between just France and Germany would be crazy expensive for lack of economies of scale. And it only take one election change to have a new government in either country pull out of the project, like how France pulled out of the Eurofighter.


Germany is in an especially hard situation. The German Air Force is falling apart today. They need new planes right now. They can’t wait 20 years until this SCAF plane comes around, it it ever gets developed. But if Germany buys the F-35, then that would kill the SCAF. It’s an issue of timing.

1374,"It kinda does since English isn't the ""native"" language of Ireland, therefore no one would see it as Irish dominance over the EU. Which brings me back to the point I was originally trying to make, finding a language that won't give a country preferential treatment or in other words a dominant position that will frighten other members. This isn't about Ireland and the other minor countries, it's about Germany, France and the UK. They're the leading economies in Europe and consequently German, French and English are the most understood languages here. So if you wanted to declare a future primary language for Europe (which in pursuit of european integration you'll eventually need to do), one of those would be the most reasonable pick. But there's a drawback, whichever language you pick the other countries will see it as the chosen country dominating the Union, ultimately weakening the unity of the EU. So you need a language that's both widely understood in Europe while it at the same time doesn't give one of the major countries preferential treatment. With the UK out of the picture, English is 'freed up' as a language. And while Ireland does primarily speak English, no one is worried about the Irish dominating the EU, or at least not to the same degree as they would've been about the British, French or Germans.

I gave you the fucking number of victims behind Republican lines, confirmed by multiple sources, how is that pretending massacres were minimal? I just stated the historical fact, just like that Nationalists carried their terror campaign in planned maner, while on Republican side behind massacres were anarchists and violent mob, who used the collapse of state to start a revolution, and with whom the Republican government was in conflict.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; War crimes don't exist 

So you are accusing me of denying crimes and then you say that? WHAT. THE. FUCK.  


&gt; communist paramilitaries 

I already told you most of them weren't paramilitaries but a citizens or defenders of the city (probably from the army or police force). But I can give you another example, if you don't like this one, the massacre of civilians fleeing Malaga. Up to five thousand unarmed civilians were killed by Natonialists. Men, women, kids, elders, everyone. What about that? Or maybe those were just 90-year old communist paramilitaries, veterans from Paris Commune and 5-month baby spies of Stalin?  


&gt; You can deny the Comintern rigged elections all you like it's a well known fact of Stalin backing the ""republic""

Yep, I can deny. The Communists in those 'rigged' elections earned 17 seats out of 473. My damn grandma can rig elections better.

and then in the meantime while nuclear decreased and coal and oil stayed steady natural gas has increased. had nuclear not decreased this could have been avoided. all in all CO2 emmisions from power production in Gemany have remained stagnant from 2010-2016. compare this to Britain which has halved CO2 emissions from the electrcity sector in the same time.

I saw their lawyer and the president of Francisco Franco National Foundation on TV today. Basically, their argument is playing the victim card and reduce everything to a violation of their rights as a family. They argued: ""What we see here is that a family is not allowed to bury their grandfather wherever they want; unlike the rest of Spanish families"". They didn't even mention Franco; wow it's all about the ""grandfather of the family"".

They said so because the Court also rejected their second choice, in case Franco wasn't allowed to remain in the Valley of the Fallen, which was to move Frranco in a crypt beneath Almudena Cathedral, literally in central Madrid city. What would make it a much more central place of pilgrimage than the actual Valley of the Fallen, in Madrid's outskirts. 

My predictions? The ECHR path is laughable. With the Spanish Constitutional Court there may be more doubts. Most of its judges are conservative, and some may even sympathize with Franco.

Now, I don't seek to incur the wrath of the late holy Central African emperor Bokassa I - may his enlightened imperial majesty rest in eternal peace -, so I won't denigrate the undeniable international superpower that is Central Africa, but perhaps it's not that central to the Vucic-Merkel talks.

As you said yourself, it's 5 EU states that don't recognize it, and just one is enough to make sure they never join. Which is why they're pushing us to recognize it, cause if the parent state does, no reason for others not to. We agreed to not block them if we join first, but again, we don't have to, there's 5 existing members that would.

Except we had full right to claim it seeing how the Ottomans took it from us. And we took it back. Albanians moving in during the Ottoman times while our people fled north is not our problem. It was agreed that the borders following the First Balkan war be drawn based on who had what before the Turks came. By your logic plenty of areas in Greece, Bulgaria, N. Macedonia and even Serbia itself should've remained a part of the Ottoman empire cause the Turks, or local Muslims who by that point often identified more with them than Christians, were a majority. 

Albania's borders established then were pretty similar to what they had at their peak before the Turks conquered them. So it was fair.

1840,"BERLIN — Just off a wide boulevard in a leafy west Berlin suburb, the U.S.-German friendship is alive and well.

Americans play football, sail and dance with their German friends.  The decades-old bond between the two countries is on full display.

Trouble is, it's *only* a display. Opened in 1998, the [Allied Museum](http://www.alliiertenmuseum.de/en/home.html), a free exhibition housed in an old U.S. Army theater, offers a window into what once was — and a welcome escape from what is.

Nearly 75 years after the end of World War II, the U.S.-German relationship isn’t just moribund, it’s on life support.

At both the official and unofficial level, the foundation that has  supported the transatlantic alliance since the 1950s is crumbling. About  85 percent of Germans consider their country’s relationship with the  U.S. to be “bad” or “very bad,” according to a recent study, while a  clear majority want Germany to distance itself from the U.S.

Angela Merkel is in the United States this week for the United  Nations climate conference but a meeting with the U.S. president, who is  also in New York, is not on her agenda. Merkel didn’t see Trump during  her last visit to the U.S. in May either.

While Merkel visits the U.N., her heir apparent, Defense Minister  Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, is in Washington, where she is expected to  face more tough questions at the Pentagon over German defense spending.

The fraying of ties — which began long before Trump came to power but  has accelerated since — carries implications that stretch far beyond  the two countries’ bilateral relationship. With China seeking to expand  its influence in Europe, and Russia eager to exploit the transatlantic  rift, the disintegration of German-American unity would have profound  implications for the future of NATO and the broader global order.

That might be why both sides are trying to pretend everything is OK.

“I have German in my blood,” Trump, who has treated Germany like a piñata since he took office in 2017, said during a brief [encounter](https://www.thelocal.de/20190826/i-have-german-in-my-blood-us-president-trump-on-his-plans-to-visit-merkel)  with Merkel at the G7 meeting in France last month. He added he would  be “very honored” to visit her in Berlin, while acknowledging he has no  firm plans to do so.

Trump’s sudden affinity for the land of his [forebears](https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-ancestry-forefathers-kallstadt/) triggered an audible guffaw from Merkel, who did her best during their joint press conference to keep a straight face.

“It’s not a problem for us to address difficult topics with one another,” she insisted.

### More worried than wunderbar

Berlin is so worried about the deterioration in the ties with its  biggest trading partner that Germany's Foreign Office is funding a  special initiative dubbed ""[*Wunderbar* Together](https://wunderbartogether.org/),"" a yearlong series of events across the U.S. meant to remind Americans how much the two countries really like one another.

Merkel's role in America's culture wars, where — depending on the  stage — she plays either the villain who opened the floodgates to  uncontrolled Muslim migration, or the saint who rescued people in need,  has complicated Germany's PR effort. That was apparent during the German  leader's May visit, when she was celebrated like a lost savior during  her [commencement speech to Harvard graduates.](https://www.politico.eu/article/german-chancellor-angela-merkel-takes-aim-at-donald-trump-in-harvard-tear-down-walls-speech/)

Merkel appeared to revel in the adulation. Whether it helps Germany,  which depends on the U.S. both in economic and strategic terms, to have  its leader at the center of America's partisan battlefield is another  question.

Germans' attitude to Trump is much more straightforward: They universally [dislike him](https://www.dw.com/en/germans-fear-donald-trump-more-than-vladimir-putin-poll-finds/a-44680092).

When it comes to relations between nations, most Americans continue to have a [positive view](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/11/26/americans-and-germans-are-worlds-apart-in-views-of-their-countries-relationship/) of Germany — in contrast to Germans' opinion of the U.S.

But the “difficult topics” that Merkel referenced dominate the  official conversation. Whether the question is Iran, trade, defense  spending or climate change, Berlin and Washington are at loggerheads.  Even in areas where strategic logic should make them natural allies —  such as confronting China’s growing influence — the two have failed to  move beyond their differences.

It’s tempting to blame the troubled relations on Trump’s withering  attacks on Germany. His riffs on Germany’s tepid defense spending, its  chronic trade surpluses and “[Ahngula’s](https://www.n-tv.de/der_tag/Trump-Angela-Angela-du-musst-deine-Rechnung-zahlen-article21156695.html)” migration policies are among the highlights of his rhetorical repertoire.

“In contrast to every other president before him, Trump has created  the impression that partnership amongst equals isn’t desired,” former  German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel, who now heads the transatlantic  lobbying group Atlantik Brücke, told me [recently](https://www.politico.eu/article/trump-germany-sigmar-gabriel-frenemy/).

In truth, the U.S.-German alliance has never been a partnership of  equals. Tension has been part of the mix throughout the post-war era to  varying degrees. If Konrad Adenauer and John F. Kennedy shared a mutual  dislike, Helmut Schmidt and Jimmy Carter absolutely despised one  another.

From the 1960s until the end of the Cold War, Germans took to the  streets in droves to voice their opposition to both the U.S. war in  Vietnam and the arms race with the Soviets.

Even so, this time, things really are different. And that's not just down to Trump.

1858,"BERLIN — Just off a wide boulevard in a leafy west Berlin suburb, the U.S.-German friendship is alive and well.

Americans play football, sail and dance with their German friends. The decades-old bond between the two countries is on full display.

Trouble is, it's *only* a display. Opened in 1998, the [Allied Museum](http://www.alliiertenmuseum.de/en/home.html), a free exhibition housed in an old U.S. Army theater, offers a window into what once was — and a welcome escape from what is.

Nearly 75 years after the end of World War II, the U.S.-German relationship isn’t just moribund, it’s on life support.

At both the official and unofficial level, the foundation that has supported the transatlantic alliance since the 1950s is crumbling. About 85 percent of Germans consider their country’s relationship with the U.S. to be “bad” or “very bad,” according to a recent study, while a clear majority want Germany to distance itself from the U.S.

&gt;“I have German in my blood” — *Donald Trump*

Angela Merkel is in the United States this week for the United Nations climate conference but a meeting with the U.S. president, who is also in New York, is not on her agenda. Merkel didn’t see Trump during her last visit to the U.S. in May either.

While Merkel visits the U.N., her heir apparent, Defense Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, is in Washington, where she is expected to face more tough questions at the Pentagon over German defense spending.

The fraying of ties — which began long before Trump came to power but has accelerated since — carries implications that stretch far beyond the two countries’ bilateral relationship. With China seeking to expand its influence in Europe, and Russia eager to exploit the transatlantic rift, the disintegration of German-American unity would have profound implications for the future of NATO and the broader global order.

That might be why both sides are trying to pretend everything is OK.

“I have German in my blood,” Trump, who has treated Germany like a piñata since he took office in 2017, said during a brief [encounter](https://www.thelocal.de/20190826/i-have-german-in-my-blood-us-president-trump-on-his-plans-to-visit-merkel) with Merkel at the G7 meeting in France last month. He added he would be “very honored” to visit her in Berlin, while acknowledging he has no firm plans to do so.

Trump’s sudden affinity for the land of his [forebears](https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-ancestry-forefathers-kallstadt/) triggered an audible guffaw from Merkel, who did her best during their joint press conference to keep a straight face.

“It’s not a problem for us to address difficult topics with one another,” she insisted.

### More worried than wunderbar

Berlin is so worried about the deterioration in the ties with its biggest trading partner that Germany's Foreign Office is funding a special initiative dubbed ""[*Wunderbar* Together](https://wunderbartogether.org/),"" a yearlong series of events across the U.S. meant to remind Americans how much the two countries really like one another.

Merkel's role in America's culture wars, where — depending on the stage — she plays either the villain who opened the floodgates to uncontrolled Muslim migration, or the saint who rescued people in need, has complicated Germany's PR effort. That was apparent during the German leader's May visit, when she was celebrated like a lost savior during her [commencement speech to Harvard graduates.](https://www.politico.eu/article/german-chancellor-angela-merkel-takes-aim-at-donald-trump-in-harvard-tear-down-walls-speech/)

Merkel appeared to revel in the adulation. Whether it helps Germany, which depends on the U.S. both in economic and strategic terms, to have its leader at the center of America's partisan battlefield is another question.

Germans' attitude to Trump is much more straightforward: They universally [dislike him](https://www.dw.com/en/germans-fear-donald-trump-more-than-vladimir-putin-poll-finds/a-44680092).

When it comes to relations between nations, most Americans continue to have a [positive view](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/11/26/americans-and-germans-are-worlds-apart-in-views-of-their-countries-relationship/) of Germany — in contrast to Germans' opinion of the U.S.

But the “difficult topics” that Merkel referenced dominate the official conversation. Whether the question is Iran, trade, defense spending or climate change, Berlin and Washington are at loggerheads. Even in areas where strategic logic should make them natural allies — such as confronting China’s growing influence — the two have failed to move beyond their differences.

It’s tempting to blame the troubled relations on Trump’s withering attacks on Germany. His riffs on Germany’s tepid defense spending, its chronic trade surpluses and “[Ahngula’s](https://www.n-tv.de/der_tag/Trump-Angela-Angela-du-musst-deine-Rechnung-zahlen-article21156695.html)” migration policies are among the highlights of his rhetorical repertoire.

“In contrast to every other president before him, Trump has created the impression that partnership amongst equals isn’t desired,” former German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel, who now heads the transatlantic lobbying group Atlantik Brücke, told me [recently](https://www.politico.eu/article/trump-germany-sigmar-gabriel-frenemy/).

In truth, the U.S.-German alliance has never been a partnership of equals. Tension has been part of the mix throughout the post-war era to varying degrees. If Konrad Adenauer and John F. Kennedy shared a mutual dislike, Helmut Schmidt and Jimmy Carter absolutely despised one another.

From the 1960s until the end of the Cold War, Germans took to the streets in droves to voice their opposition to both the U.S. war in Vietnam and the arms race with the Soviets.

Even so, this time, things really are different. And that's not just down to Trump.

### People power

For decades the German-U.S. relationship was sustained not just by military alliances and business interests, but by personal bonds. Even Germans critical of the U.S. agreed that American engagement was better than the alternative. At times of tension and disagreement, most Germans gave America the benefit of the doubt.

Over the course of the Cold War, millions of American soldiers were stationed in Germany, where many married and had children. Untold thousands of German teenagers went to the U.S. as exchange students and countless more studied at U.S. universities.

With the fall of the Berlin Wall, the number of U.S. military personnel fell dramatically from nearly 250,000 in 1985 to about 35,000 today. Though the U.S. remains a favorite destination for German high schoolers, the number of exchange students heading across the Atlantic has [dropped](https://de.statista.com/infografik/15212/deutsche-schueleraustauschprogramme/) by about 30 percent since 2009 to fewer than 6,000.

As the U.S. troops have gradually withdrawn, the residual gratitude many Germans felt over their presence has also evaporated.

During my first posting in Germany as a correspondent in the mid-1990s, the Germans I met brimmed with enthusiasm for all things American and were full of stories of their adventures there. Even if they took issue with many U.S. policies, there was a reserve of goodwill, a sense that we were all on the same side.

When the subject comes up these days, it’s like walking on eggshells.

“My father was a big fan of the U.S. and its democracy,” a new acquaintance told me recently, making it clear that he didn’t share his father’s perspective.

The German distrust began to take hold in the aftermath of 9/11.

1874,"While Germany’s decision under then-Chancellor Gerhard Schröder proved to be prescient, it also left a wound that has never fully healed. In recent years, Germany’s view of the U.S. has been framed by Guantanamo, NSA spying and Trump’s attacks.

Those issues made it easier for Germans to ignore persistent U.S. demands that Berlin reduce its massive export surplus, which most economists agree exacerbate global imbalances, or that it meet the NATO defense spending target. The last two U.S. administrations also pressured Merkel's government to spend more on security, albeit with little success. Trump, on the other hand, appears to have gotten the Germans' attention.

But Trump's relentless pressure campaign has come at a cost at street level.

&gt;“At the moment, Trump is the dominant factor in the transatlantic relationship”  — *Wolfgang Ischinger, former German ambassador to Washington*

For almost 60 years, Germans and Americans have celebrated their friendship with an annual *Volksfest*, an open-air fair with a replica town from the Old West, hotdogs and American music. In July, the fest was canceled for the second time in three years after Berlin Mayor Michael Müller, who heads a leftist coalition, claimed to have failed to find a venue.

Just weeks earlier, Müller’s city government refused to allow 20 “Candy Bombers” — the historic U.S. transport aircraft used during the Berlin Airlift — to land at the city’s Tempelhof airport, citing local laws and safety regulations. Some of the planes had been flown over from the U.S. for the event.

What’s striking about such incidents is that few Germans seem to really care. A couple of newspaper writers expressed outrage over the Candy Bomber snub, but the story was quickly forgotten.

Even though the U.S. remains the guarantor of German security, for many Germans, both in and out of government, America is just another partner, not a true friend. Travel-obsessed Germans still visit the U.S. by the millions on vacation, to enjoy the beaches in Florida or the sights of New York. Just like they go to Turkey, another erstwhile German friend with whom relations have soured.

Recent suggestions by U.S. officials that Washington might transfer its German-based forces to Poland were met with a collective shrug in Berlin. Even though most German officials viewed it as an empty threat, some joked that losing the bases might be worth it if it took Germany out of Trump’s crosshairs.

With official German-U.S. relations at such a low point, it’s been left to a small band of die-hard believers to keep the transatlantic flame burning.

“At the moment, Trump is the dominant factor in the transatlantic relationship,” said Wolfgang Ischinger, the former German ambassador to Washington who now heads the Munich Security Conference, an annual forum that has been a fixture of the transatlantic dialogue for decades.

Ischinger does not believe the the U.S.-German alliance can return to the “status quo ante” after Trump’s presidency, but he said he hasn't given up hope on a relationship that delivered his country from tyranny and returned it to prosperity.

“George W. Bush wasn’t that popular in Western Europe either,” he told me. “But as soon as Barack Obama emerged as a candidate, 200,000 people ran to Berlin’s Victory Column to listen to him speak and to cheer. Suddenly, America was highly popular again and our entire nation was excited.”

If all else fails, that could be the final exhibit in the Allied Museum.

120+ agreements is the *total* number of treaties between Switzerland and the EU (and it's more like 150 nowadays). Somebody clearly just took that number from a treaty database and said ""voila!""; when in reality it includes minuscule and nigh irrelevant agreements, such as the one from the 1960s on free trade of tomato soup or the one on coordinated surveying of migratory birds. Schengen is also counted a few dozen times because each amendment of the agreement is  ratified as a separate treaty, and therefore listed separately.

The treaties that take over some of the rights and obligations of the EU's single market are what's called the Bilateral Agreements 1 package. Those are the ones that have the guillotine clause around them. There are only 7 of them inside the package, 5 of which being relevant to the Single Market. They are most definitely not the same as the EEA treaty. Besides being of course of much limited scope (roughly considered to be about 1/3rd of the Acquis Communautaire in 1999, which is why Switzerland pays 1/3rd less in cohesion payments than a country of it's size would - nowadays, after 2 decades of stagnation, it's of course far less  than that); there are also some differences in substance, e.g. EEA members are allowed to put up immigration quotas against a new EU member for it's first 7 years of membership, but it's 9 years in the Swiss-EU treaty on free movement of people.",Bern (Switzerland),/r/europe/comments/d6bnxj/a_map_from_a_2016_reddit_post_represents/f1azi9g/,Lejeune_Dirichelet,1569315983

My intention with writing this, however, is to illustrate what the everyday Russian that does not sit on social media (I. E. The vast majority of Russians) feels about these accusations.

Most Russians feel outraged by these allegations of doping not because they think doping is morally wrong, but because in the mind of the average Russian, literally every single athlete in the Olympics is doping and most Russians as such find it unfair that only they are getting banned.

So simply revealing the Russians as doping is not going to change their minds.

 It was closer to school and library, you didn't need to walk by the road towards nowhere for no reason. Same thing happened to Likenai bus stop, the old one, was much nicer, although it was just a concrete box, those there nicer than these.

But look at me complaining like an old man. Progress is fantastic and I can't wait to see even more of it. I think they have opened [bridge](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=sirvenos+ezero+tiltas&amp;t=ffab&amp;iax=images&amp;ia=images) again? Cool that I'm going home soon.

2248,"&gt;Poland’s opposition on Monday called for the dismissal of the nation’s chief auditor following allegations that he let his house to a business which rented rooms by the hour and didn’t issue receipts.

&gt;The allegations that surfaced over the weekend are a new embarrassment for the ruling right-wing party ahead of Oct. 13 parliamentary elections, which the Law and Justice party is nevertheless expected to win.

&gt;Private TVN24 said over the weekend that Marian Banas, head of the Supreme Audit Office and former finance minister, let a house he owns in the southern city of Krakow to a shady business. It is illegal in Poland to facilitate prostitution.

&gt;Banas, who was *appointed three weeks ago*, said in a statement he had let the house for hotel purposes but has since sold it. He said he was taking TVN24 to court.

&gt;TVN24 hidden camera footage showed a reporter making payment to use a room for one hour, but not being given a receipt — in violation of fiscal law.

&gt;Questioned about it by the reporter, the man at the counter could be heard saying that he needed to call Banas about how to reply.

2404,"&gt;Absolutely, commieblocks really are an amazing way of providing a lot of good living space for a comparably low cost.

No, they are not.

We called the apartments ""matchboxes"" cause it felt like living in one.

They were poorly designed, there was no thought for parks, car parkings, ergonomy, efficiency, fitting with the environment etc.

They were just done as cheap as possible at industrial scale, so they could rapidly industrialize the country. They brought peasants from all over the country to live in these apartments and work in factories. And those people started growing chickens on the balconies and sometimes even pigs, cause that's all they knew. 

These fucking pieces of shit buildings were chock full of cockroaches, too. Some black, some red, all disgusting. All it took was one filthy family in the entire building, and you never got rid of cockroaches. Usually there were many filthy families in each building. 

As someone else mentioned, the floors were uneven, the walls were never straight, even the stairs weren't 2 the same size. Each step had a different surface and height. 

&gt;not just in the former GDR

Yeah, maybe the Germans were, well, German, and did their work better than the Romanians and others. But communist blocks are shit. I have no problem with people living in taller buildings.

During communism, towns were demolished and commie blocks were built instead so instead of a widespread town you have 10-20 commie blocks where everyone lives and that's basically the city. However houses are being built around them so I suppose it's better. 

In Bucharest you have the choice between the ultra expensive parisian/romanian architecture areas, semi-expensive commie blocks, the cheaper periphery with houses that are far away from the city center, or expensive new buildings, but those generally tend to be bought by young professionals starting their life.",Bromania,/r/europe/comments/d81xbf/rehabilitation_of_old_communist_blocks_bucharest/f1ahv25/,outslide,1569294421

Communists gave little thought to parks. They wanted to industrialize the country, so parks were not a priority. 

Had lots of friends who played in the streets. There were far fewer cars then, but still. 

&gt;Most of the downsides, such as poor insulation/noise levels is due to bad construction, often in the late 70s and 80s. Earlier commieblocs had much better soundproofing.

This is just stupid talk. Nigeria has a GDP per capita of $2400. There's no fucking way they become even remotely competitive with Western Europe in the next 50 years, not matter what tech transfers you make. Eastern Europe is now around $15k, which is light years ahead of Nigeria, and people still move West in too large numbers.

Even if you find some miraculous way to make African nations grow economically and prosper very quickly (which, I repeat, is impossible) you're still left with the issue of the planet definitely not having enough resources to support 5 billion people living Western European lifestlyles.

2544,"&gt; How many innocent people were killed by GAL???

All the hundreds of people that were killed by GAL were innocent. There's no death penalty in Spain. GAL were murderers. Two examples:

https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caso_Marey a French furniture seller, no relation with ETA at all

[Los GAL asumen la responsabilidad del asesinato de dos ciudadanos franceses cerca de Bayona](https://elpais.com/diario/1985/06/16/espana/487720802_850215.html) more French citizens

GAL were illegal Spanish police death squads established and funded by the Spanish government, that functioned as State terrorism. Are you really defending that? Why we need courts or a democracy when we can just kill people? If GAL happened to find you suspicious, they would kidnap you, kill you and hide your body. It didn't matter if there weren't clear evidences that you had committed a crime at all.

&gt; About the first link, you are talking about a couple cops that have been well-deserved suspended and they were not committed in a prison or jail.

*The camera recordings, decisive*

*In these recordings, you can see how one of the convicted agents tipped one of the detainees in the hallway next to the cells. Afterwards, the other convicted police officer can be seen changing their regulatory defense weapon while they close the door. And when it opens again, the video shows one of the detainees moving down the hall limping.*

You get 60% of your *base salary*, but Japanese salaries are typically structured so that the base salary is pretty low, and you get a lot of allowances and bonuses on top. In my case, I would've received roughly 35% of my actual pay. I simply couldn't afford to take any leave at all. Managed to use half a vacation day to attend the birth of my son, and then went to work in the afternoon.  
The parental leave pay is also paid out several months after you apply so you need to have savings beforehand, plus you have to cover health insurance and pension payments on your own while you're on leave (normally that's automatically deducted from your salary).  

Having a lot of paid days available doesn't matter if the *per day* pay is low.

There have also been a lot of articles in the news lately about fathers who have been retaliated against, demoted, or fired, for taking parental leave.

There's a reason why the norm in Japan is still for mothers to quit their jobs and become housewives when they have kids, and less than 5% of fathers take any parental leave at all.",Sweden,/r/europe/comments/d8ai6o/paid_parental_leave_how_eu_countries_compare_in/f19z2d4/,zaiueo,1569281583

If all the fishermen reregister in every EU nation, then it surely doesn't defeat the purpose in the first place. So much EU business seems to be about the letter of, and not the spirit of, the law. It's a dumb regulation for something like fishing, which a nationalistic sacred cow for so many countries because of the disaffected rural communities it supports and because of its image as a traditional, honest, working-class profession.

2734,"&gt;You can't just go around and randomly fine people. You'd at least have to proof that the directors actually caused the mess or at least could reasonably have prevented it.

How many years has TC been in decline? At least eight. In that time what have the directors done to avoid catastrophe? Have they sold off assets? Have they restructured their organisation? Have they adapted to changes within the market? The answer to these questions ranges from no, to barely. Their competitors have made enormous changes.

&gt;And to prove that would of course be neigh impossible since nobody can truly predict the market. So if the directors acted according to their best knowledge, faithfully executed their duties and followed a plausible strategy, there's not much you can fault them for.

Except that we can compare the failures of these directors to their competitors.

&gt;Businesses fail, that is just a natural part of capitalism and its process of creative destruction.

Indeed they do, but it is rare for them to explode like a supernova, and far more common for them to wither away. 15,000 people lost their jobs today. Even if we assume that the collapse of this company was inevitable, with better management these people might have been made redundant over the course of years, rather than over the course of a few hours. 15,000 people with experience and expertise in an industry, who now are simultaneously going to be competing for whatever job openings there are within the industry. Let us be generous and assume that 5000 find work within a month. That leaves 10,000 people no longer contributing to the economy, no longer paying taxes, stuck without the ability to earn income. Why should the responsible parties walk away freely? Perhaps some of the 20 million pound bonuses which were paid out to senior management last year should be confiscated.

Perhaps those responsible for the failures should be made to bear a portion of the cost?

2751,"That is indeed the most reasonable and democratic approach to solve the conflict. After all, some 80% of Catalans demand a referendum on independence to solve this. Which means that the absolute majority of Catalans want to solve it in a referendum, where the result is respected no matter if it's independence or remaining in Spain.

The majority of Catalan parties do support the referendum. However, that's not the case of Spanish parties in Spanish Parliament. And I don't think this is going to change in the near future. The two major Spanish parties (PP and PSOE) simply don't want Catalans voting on this. And it doesn't seem that it will change int he near future. I don't think our country is mature enough for this.

For a long time in history, Catalans have tried to secede from Spain, get more autonomy or be recognized as an independent state in a Spanish federation. For many years, Catalonia's independence and its status inside Spain had been a permanent topic of discussion in Madrid. Until a solution came in 1932. In 1932, 99% of Catalans voted in favor of having their right to self-determination recognized and to be defined as an autonomous State inside Spain. This was discussed in Spanish Parliament, were it was rejected, but Catalonia was granted a new autonomy instead. And discussion remained open for more recognition in the future. 

A few years later, however, everything ended when Franco troops won the Spanish Civil War in 1939. This led to 40 years of strictly unitary dictatorship, that had as one of its main objectives the prevention of any independence from Spain. All the progress made in the past, was destroyed there. And we haven't recovered yet from that. Decades of Spanish nationalism, indoctrination in schools, Francoism... that weren't completely eliminated during the Transition. Franco proclaimed the King as his successor and before dying, Franco told him to preserve Spain's unity at all cost. It was the only order the king got from Franco. Then, Francoists introduced the indivisibility of Spain in the Constitution. 

And that's how the things are now. A referendum seems a very difficult option for the Catalans. Unless they do it unilaterally of course, which is also hard.",Spain,/r/europe/comments/d8434w/catalan_separatists_held_for_planning_violent/f19ihxw/,JoseLuisAbalos,1569272909

Of course it is. It is a clear promise to go to the electorate and then act with whatever mandate that throws back. The Party is divided on brexit, so is the country, there is nothing particularly outrageous in suggesting it'd ask again.

&gt;Do they want to negotiate a new WA just to eliminate the risk of no deal, but they would rather remain in the EU? Or is their preferred option to be outside the EU, with remaining as a backup.

Again, I think the point here is that the country is divided, there is no simple answer, to presenting two viable options to the electorate and going on the basis of the outcome is entirely reasonable.

This is an entirely consistent position, it may not be a hard leave or hard remain one, but it does seem more likely to lead to an exit with a sensible deal than what the Tories are currently offering, which will be a positive to lots of leave supporting Labour voters (who'd like out, but don't want a no-deal exit if a better alternative is available).",United Kingdom - Personally vouched for by /u/colourfox,/r/europe/comments/d874qu/british_party_support_2019/f18yker/,-ah,1569265292

You're unhappy with a system that makes ALL votes count equally, in favour of a system that gives an unfair representation for voters and makes many votes not count? OK. The SNP get less seats under PR because they have way more seats than their votes should give them in a fair system. That's like complaining that it's unfair and harder to win since the officials have stopped you starting a football game 5-0 up and made you start at 0-0

&gt;another recent example was a proposal of a 2/3rd majority needed in Indyref2

Do you understand what the word ""proposal"" means? It's not a law, it's an idea. If anything, it's a good idea as you had a ref, you voted to remain, so now you want another one so best make sure it's concrete result. Will you have indyref3 if you win this one or does voting the way the SNP want end the need for it? SNP tried every cheat in the book to win the vote from a question ruled biased by the Electoral Commission, to holding it just after they spent millions on the 800th anniversary of Bannockburn, to allowing 16 year olds to vote and still lost.

I'm not saying it is outrageous. But if the party is divided, it clearly cannot have a position, like you're desperately trying to convince us.

Having a position means that you are offering a vision for the United Kingdom on its relationship with Europe. Labour has failed to come up with any plan, any vision for the future.

I can accept that they are divided on this question, they have no position and they will implement whatever the electorate wants (though that does not explain why they opposed to support it the first time). But that is not a position, it's an admission that their only position is against something and not for something.

\&gt;  This is an entirely consistent position, it may not be a hard leave or  hard remain one

How can it be consistent when it comprises two \*incompatible\* outcomes.

This has nothing to do with complexity/semplicity or hard leave/remain. I can accept as complex a position you want. ""We want to leave but we want to secure this kind of relationship with the EU.""

Scotland has 4 parties with a good chance of seats

&gt;I can and I will complain if people like yourself complain about the SNP, which was your response to my comment - if you can complain, 

I have NEVER complained about the SNP on here. You have complained about other parties so you've assumed I complained about the SNP to make a response when in fact I haven't. You're reading what you want into my comments. I attacked the voting system that means many votes effectively don't count. 

&gt;I can complain and I feel the SNP’s point about the decades of problems with FPTP are well made whereas the Tories are deluded 

The SNP take great advantage of FPTP. That was the point. You cannot say that FPTP is a bad system because it gives a government you don't want (i.e. the Tories) when the same system gives the SNP an unrepresentative amount of seats.

&gt;Thats the current political landscape and beating the SNP alone with this stick is pointless and only serves only unionist politics

In general, why this things seems really unlikely to me is basic supply and demand. If you want to sell something, but there isn't anyone to afford it you are not going to do any selling, so naturally the prices of similar goods drop to the level that there are buyers and if there are such a big price difference between wages and real estate either people hide most of their income or there are foreign people buying up all the stuff, which in countries with wages of 3600€ a year is not likely.",Lithuania,/r/europe/comments/d81xbf/rehabilitation_of_old_communist_blocks_bucharest/f190usr/,uniklas,1569266269

The rotten system would be there regardless of the EU. Member states still have most sovereingty over their financial development, even those that adopted euro.

CEEC were indeed developing before joining, but that was also in a large part thanks to the EU. Transition of their economies was supported by the EU financially, and furthermore they underwent many complex reforms to meet the Copenhagen Criteria. Now they are doing *better* in the EU as most CEEC regions get quite big funds from the EU.

Norway and Switzerland are out of the EU precisely because they are doing too well. Also, they are kind of in the EU already, because Norway is part of the EEA (Lichtenstein and Island also) which means it has to adopt most of the EU's legislative, and even pay for the membership quite big money.

Imo they are a net positive economically, and if they would start to consider learning Spanish probably they would be fun people for other retired people to hang out, unfortunately, on average, they keep to themselves, forming communities like they were in a different country (of course not everyone, but many, usually Germans in a much lesser degree).

wether you like it or not, such argumentations while may seem like trump card for you, have their own implications and complications

and im not ignoring the difference, im saying that that difference does not justify devaluation of said life to the point it can be terminated even if it doesnt endangers mothers life and mother doesnt even need to explain why she wants to kill another human being nor have medical reason to do so

killing without reason, or killing because of inconvenience, however great, is not justyfied, it is not justified to kill a human inside of you because you dont want it, not wanting something to live, even if its INVOLUNTARY dependend on you doesnt give you right to decide its fate

&gt;A gift of life is granted by a woman

life is not a gift, life happens, and long ago humans decided that life has certain rights, and that the way we  treat such life determines how we are treated, that whole line is a power trip, ,, oh i give birth or i give abortion, power of life and death in palm of my hand, no one can stop me, otherwise im not free""

determining your genders freedom based on ones ability to destroy human being in its most vulnerable stage of life is very sick concept

and your lines about laws, i mean i can list milions laws that were lawfull and accepted by society and completely immoral and we now look at them as barbaric, something being legal doesnt mean anything when morality is concerned, im sure youre familiar with the line ,,everything hitler did in germany was legal"", im not using that line to compare you or pro choicers to hitler, im using it to ilustrate the pointlessness of pointing out legality of the issue

EDIT: 

not to forget

&gt; You have no right to command women whether they have to give anyone life or not. 

but you are commanded to do it, after certain time period, and you are commanded a lot of things, i am commanded a lot of things, as i said, exercise of our freedoms is inherently limited as to not infringe on freedom of others

the line itself, ,,command women wheter they have to give anyone life or not"" implies that not commanding them to give life and they deciding to not give it means killing it, and commanding someone not to kill is perfectly moral and no one should have freedom to kill",,/r/europe/comments/d7uocb/50_000_people_were_marching_for_lives_of_unborn/f180pjc/,Wolf1481,1569251003

See this paper for an interesting case: [Multilingualism in the Northwest Amazon, Revisited∗](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.422.6762&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf). A kind of exogamy like the one described in the paper also existed in my country, Australia, which helps explain why the Australian Aborginal peoples were traditionally extremely multilingual. There's still people around who speak 6-7 languages, but colonialism and linguicide has really messed Australian multilingualism up.

&gt;Brazilians are monolingual because they basically are their own continent,

It took a linguistic policy that favoured Portuguese, and continues to do so, to stitch Brazil together linguistically. The Portuguese supremacist ideology accounts for not only the persecution of indigenous and African languages, but the campaigns to destroy the languages of immigrants, many millions strong, such as the Venetian language or or Plattdeutsch.

NOW it's the case that Brazil is a regional heavyweight with 200 million, mostly monolingual, Brazilians, but that is merely the end product of a bleaching process. I don't think that an average Brazilian from Porto Alegre is monolingual in Portuguese because they are being actively persecuted by the Brazilian state and thus forced to be monolingual at gun point. But they are monolingual as an end product of decades, even centuries, worth of first Portuguese and then Brazilian, oppression of Brazilian linguistic diversity. It's like a steam roller that has built up momentum, now it's hard to stop, and the remaining multilingual people in Brazil are getting crushed.",,/r/europe/comments/d838yf/empires_of_portugal_and_spain_1790/f180u16/,paniniconqueso,1569251055

Sites, or rather digital corporations,  that are admitedly legitimate, such as Google or even moreso Fakebook, do their part in diseminating misinformation. Targeted advertising enables targeted disinformation and undercover political propaganda. See Cambridge Analytica.

By capturing and concentrating the advertising market, those companies deprive the traditional press of what used to be a life-sustaining revenue. The printed press as lost 70% of its revenue in the last 20 years, sacked half of its workforce, including back-office but essential positions such as documentalists, proofreaders, fact-checkers ...

Digital media enable a quick dissemination of information, which is good. However, by reducing the news cycle to mere minutes, it deprived the journalists of the opportunity to do what they are good at : investigation, verification, cultivating sources and whatever journalists *used* to do and were trained for.

The laws and regulations governing the free press in democracy have not evolved much since the late 19^th century. They more or less survived to, and incorporated, radio and television.

3073,"Healthcare costs in Spain are 33% lower than in the UK. That's significant, especially considering why. The relatively low labor costs make up most of the savings.

If you look just at labour costs, we're talking about 50-60% or even 100% if you compare it with London.

But even that doesn't show the true picture. A nurse makes 35-40k pounds a year. A doctor makes 90k on average and 200k on the very high end. Even when the pound was strong that wasn't especially good. Now its roughly on paar with Germany and France and waaay below the US and Canada.

There are 150k vacancies. People aren't trying to fill them. Enticing people would require a significant pay bump. This is, again, only to cover existing patients.

Add the hundreds of thousands that would come from Spain means you also need more infrastructure. Infrastructure that's going to be difficult to build when, much like medicine, construction has over a hundred thousand vacancies. Construction materials are at an all time high in price a) because they've been going up constantly for over a decade and b) they need to be imported, which means they cost more because the pound is weak.

And again, the NHS isn't able to cover its needs now. It needs more infrastructure, higher wages, new equipment and a lot more staff now. If you took all the money spent in Spain it wouldn't cover the existing shortfall, not even remotely.

I don't know how much VAT you think they'll make, but it better be a lot and every penny better go to the NHS, because otherwise its collapsing. No two ways about it",Croatia,/r/europe/comments/d82nun/spain_will_remove_rights_for_british_residents/f181hfu/,neohellpoet,1569251324

To subvert Democracy

&gt; MPs and Governments left parts of the country behind 

Subverting Democracy in the process.

&gt; MPs and Governments allow votes to take place that their constituents 

This is point speaking specifically about Brexit.  The referendum wasn't needed, the public polls didn't support it at the time.  The public didn't care about having a say on Europe at the time it was called for.  The reason it was called is because the Tories believed Farage to be more of a threat than he actually was.  They called a referendum not out of any ""honor"" to the country or democracy process.  They called it try save their own party from internally exploding.

&gt; The issue you have is that they listened to the vote instead of ignoring it? 

Referendums shouldn't be legally binding IMO.  They're meant to be, and should be used as a ""checking in"" with the public on major issues.   I.E you hold a referendum on europe.  The vote is split by 2%, which would indicate there is no consensus on Europe.  Half the country wants to do nothing, half is unhappy.  Why would you allow a 2% margin to dictate the future of your country?  Have a G.E allow people to vote on your proposed solutions to the issue, not on the issue itself.

&gt; The issue you have is that they listened to the vote instead of ignoring it? 

No the issue is it was too close of a vote, within margin's of errors certainly.  Not only that, but it comes out that the side that won used underhanded tactics to subvert the vote, spreading miss information about the issues. Promising and guaranteeing things that were impossible to achieve.

3165,"Have you ever actually tried to get mortgage? I have. And I can't afford it. 

As per the Polish law, banks only allow up to 80% of property value, meaning that for a tiny 2-room apartment costing 450,000 (typical prices in Kraków and Warsaw), I have to provide 90,000 out of my own pocket + provision, which is an extra 10-30 thousand złotych. My mother worked her ass off her whole life as a white-collar worker for a minimal pay, and she cannot give me 100,000 złotych, I have to accumulate it myself.

Even though I'm among the 5% top earners in the country, I can't generate the necessary amount in less than 5 years. And I have no children. With just one child, my ability to save money goes down drastically. With 2 kids, I'll need a 3-room apartment - that's an extra 100,000 in costs. And I have to be fast, too, because banks won't give me mortgage if I can't pay it all off by the time I go into retirement. Considering that I still have to eat and pay a rent, I can't save up more than 30-40% of my wage. 

I could, of course, buy an apartment jointly with a spouse. But then who gets to keep it if we get a divorce?

3171,"Just because your house is pictured does not mean Google extracts value from it. Every day, your house is photographed dozens of times by satellites and those photos are used by lots of companies. If, say, a weather forecasting service uses those pictures (that have your house in them somewhere), do you complain to the weather forecasting service that they've used a picture of your house in their weather forecast? Also, this whole point is moot anyways as it's perfectly legal to take pictures of houses even if you're a commercial interest.

I am specifically referring to German law. According to § 59 (UrhG): 

&gt;&gt;(1) Zulässig ist, Werke, die sich bleibend an öffentlichen Wegen, Straßen oder Plätzen befinden, mit Mitteln der Malerei oder Graphik, durch Lichtbild oder durch Film zu vervielfältigen, zu verbreiten und öffentlich wiederzugeben. Bei Bauwerken erstrecken sich diese Befugnisse nur auf die äußere Ansicht.

A couple court cases make it even clearer but it boils down to you're allowed to photograph anyone's house or building in Germany as long as you:

- Are on public property when taking the picture

- Limit your pictures to ""Außenaufnahmen"", so no telescopically zooming in on windows 

- Don't use any ladders or drones (in practice this means heights around or below 2 meters max)

- If there are people in the photo, they must be unrecognizable or be categorized as a ""Beiwerk"", which typically means there must be more than 5 people pictured

I believe the argument you want to use is that youth turnout was lower, so complusory voting would have resulted in higher youth turnout and more votes for remain, am I right?

2 problems with that:

1. Whilst remain was strongly supported by the youth, even in the youngest age group, the leave vote was still 30%, and rose in every age group afterwards. (Also worth noting that even if 30% of 18-25 year olds want to leave, that probably still puts the UK ahead of any other Eurosceptic country)

2. In older age groups (let's say 35+) the voters who didn't turnout in the Brexit referendum (but would be forced to with compulsory voting) would most definitely have voted for Leave.

I agree people should learn the local language, it's a little crass not too - but it strikes me as more problematic in a scenario where people are looking for employment, which they are not and older people generally do struggle to learn a new language rather more than the younger people you would prefer.

Thanks for answering the bit I asked about though.. you seem to be saying they do contribute via other ways.. just not to social security related taxation, do they benefit from that though? They get their pensions and health care paid by the UK (don't their pensions also get taxed in Spain if they are considered residents? So surely at worst that is a neutral position?

Perhaps if they are such a detriment to Spain, then Spain should have done something to discourage those communities forming. Actually one of the most damaging periods to the Spanish economy recently was during the recession when Brits and others, did stop buying Spanish property... so perhaps that hints as to why it still happens. Not the entire reason, but a big contributing factor. You may prefer young people working there for the reasons given, but broadly speaking are those Brits living in Spain a net benefit to the economy or a net drain? If it's the latter I imagine a lot more would have been done to discourage them.

Usually, not much happens over here. But last week we were shocked by the [assassination of a lawyer in Amsterdam](https://www.dutchnews.nl/news/2019/09/shock-and-outrage-as-top-lawyer-is-shot-dead-in-amsterdam/)  
A bit of background. The world of organized crime in The Netherlands is increasingly run by people from north African descent, informally called the 'Mocro Maffia'. The department of justice is preparing a case against one of the kingpins, Ridouan Taghi, for the murder of six people.  
A former associate of Taghi, Nabil B, has turned state witness in the trial, after a friend of his was accidentally killed in 2017. Ever since, Taghi and others have been on the run but have left a trail of blood nonetheless, including the brother of witness Nabil B.

Last week, public prosecutor and attorney of the state witness Derk Wiersum was shot and killed in Amsterdam, a new low in the fight aainst organized crime.

Also last week, our parliament reconvened after summer recess.  In the traditional two day-long debate that marked the opening of the new political year, all parties lamented the death of Wiersum, considered it an assault on the rule of law and called for the government to step up the war on organised crime. It is likely that a new taskforce, the equivalent of the DEA, will be set up in the Netherlands.

The debate to mark the opening of the new political year was otherwise noted for its civility, the willingness to compromise and a celebration of the political center.

Fine, so when the medicine is advanced enough that fetuses can survive after 3 months, then if the woman does not want to carry the child, you can take it out of the woman's body and nurture it in an incubator. But before that happens, fetuses below the age of 3 months are fully dependent on the organism of the woman, because they are in fact, nothing more than a bunch of tissues without a developed nerve system. They do not even remotely resemble a human being.

If you want to prioritize the rights of a bunch of tissues over the rights of a fully grown sentient human being, then it's your choice, but I honestly find it ridiculous. 

Especially given that you argue from the male perspective, so you in fact do not face any threat you may face others telling you that you need to ""temporarily give up your bodily autonomy"".

3607,"I can actually see into a possible future where this has taken place...

No, of course I'm guessing. How could I know what will happen? There are no studies about this. I've said ""I'm against this, because this is what I think will happen"" from the start. I wasn't looking for a debate and frankly I have better things to do than research this stuff.

Valve's defense was specifically that they are selling subscriptions, but the court didn't buy that. Ergo, actual subscriptions would not be affected by this ruling.

So, if this ruling is not successfully appealed, and assuming Valve doesn't outright close the service for Europe, Valve would probably move to implement a second-hand market. No way in hell would they release their games onto other services, they would absolutely try to contain them on Steam and continue to enjoy their 30% (or more) cut. Many games also depend on Steamworks and other Steam platform services so that wouldn't work for them. Sure, the ruling probably stipulates that the keys should be able to be sold on any service, but if Valve plays their cards right they'll largely keep the sales on their platform.

So now we have a situation where both new and ""used"" (they're just digital licenses, they can't be used) games are sold on the same platform side by side. Selling a game is simple, you just set the price and click sell. Buying from a user is as simple as buying new and you are getting the same product.

Before the digital age, you'd have to bring the game to GameStop and get a shitty deal. Or put it up on eBay and post it to the buyer. That is if you don't want an impressive game collection in your shelf. It takes way more effort to sell. If you buy used you're getting a box that isn't pristine and a disc that may be scratched. Or you might get scammed on ebay. It's used! It's *different* from new.

The numbers you pulled directly described human behaviour under specific circumstances and I think *the circumstances would change*. Business would change too, adopting various models that circumvent the second-hand market. As I said earlier, subscription and micro transaction models would NOT be required to be resold, allowing current games like that to continue unaffected (if they are free upfront) and forcing other games to adopt models like that.

Of course things could take another turn. This is just a scenario that I find likely if the ruling is not appealed.

And I don't think this situation would be very friendly to single-player games with low replayability, so I reacted with bewilderment to your idea that those games would thrive. To address my concerns you would tell me why the current situation would be unaffected by a second-hand market like I have theorized or present an alternative outcome. Just saying that it wouldn't be affected at all and pulling numbers from a completely different situation does not help.",Finland,/r/europe/comments/d7b7em/french_court_rules_steam_users_have_right_to/f16c6lm/,fieldOfThunder,1569208141

Unfortunately, it’s **not easy to get a job in Iceland; you must have certain specialized work skills, like computer programming**. An employer has to show that the job can't be filled by an Icelander or an EEA citizen, and the employer must sign your work contract before you move to Iceland.

3803,"&gt;Germany's economy is one of the most export-based in the developed world.

Yes and most of it's trade is inter EU/Europe (65%) and North America about 10%
About 10% is Asia(Mostly China and a bit of Japan, Turkey and S. Korea). 5% is the Rest of the World. 
So not that much trade outside very secure Waters.

&gt;If not for the British, Americans, and others ensuring global freedom of navigation, Germany would have to spend a lot more to ship its products to its customers.

Also our customers are mostly the US and UK have problems with. 
The South Chinese Sea is such a problem, but even if China would claim all of it, it wouldn't hinder trade with China and other countries as there is still Innocent passage and Strait passage.

And if countries, like China don't adhere to it, not even if the German Navy was twice as big as the UK's there would be a chance to contest it. 

In addition how do you think securing shipping lanes works? Even UK/US are not protecting ships, but are mostly patrolling in endangered waters, or are fighting against territorial water claims from other countries, like China.

And mission against Piracy like ATALANTA or to help countries to secure their own territorial waters like UNIFIL Germany is helping. Missions to the South Chinese Sea, would be hard without foreign bases or oversea territories, which both US and UK have. 

&gt;Yet Germany has a very small navy with severe problems of under-funding.

As the first mission of every Nation armed forces is the defense of their home territory. And that how most Navy's are build up to. 
Countries which are Island like UK, Japan have large Navies. Or countries with large coastlines like Italy or Korea. Or countries for whom securing of the Sea is very important for defense(USA). 
Germany has a very short coastline. With both having quite special features which makes them very inaccessible for larger ships. 

So for defense we need our small U-boote (Submarines) and Schnellboote (Fast attack craft)[which we decommissioned]
But, we have Frigates and Corvettes, which are our Ship promised for NATO, with different roles, mostly suited for NATO Fleets or to be party of a NATO ally carrier fleet. 
So basically the main purpose of the German Navy is being part of NATO Fleets or US/UK/France Carrier Fleets. 

So please explain to me, what type of vessel we need for better Trade securing?

&gt;Yet Germany has a very small navy with severe problems of under-funding.

Define small Navy. It's not the biggest, but we have small coastline very secure coastlines. 
Underfunding... The U-boot story? That more bad luck and a program which is discontinued(Spare parts on Demand, which mostly is the reason for most bad Headlines and not the real issues)

Let's have an outlook in the now second smallest branch of the armed forces of Germany for the next 11 years.

9(10 as 1 is already delivered) new frigates replacing 8 old ones(total of 13).
5 additional corvettes (total 10)
2 additional U-boots (total 8)
10(or 11) new mine-warfare Units (total 10/11)
replacing old support ships.

that's what is already through. That's quite a lot and quite expensive. The manpower will be more an issue than money and vessels. As you see German Navy is growing and if you go in detail about the new ships, you can also see that Germany is tackling the difficulties with having ships far away without having bases/territory near by. 

And with the threats to the east there are thoughts about getting Fast Attack Crafts again. But those thing will be discussed with our Baltic neighbors as there is only one none allied country in the Baltic.

Bet if they are starving they wont be so hot on spreading their bullshit propaganda and trying to undermine our societies with the money we give them.

Do you honestly believe they'd starve cause of your sanctions, or even back down? Or that it would solve enough? Even if you brought them to their knees they'd get up sooner or later even more bitter. As for spreading their propaganda, your side does the same, everyone does. Do you really think you're better in that regard? The West spreads as much propaganda as Russia, likely more though.

&gt;Appeasing those KGB fuckers was the mistake of a generation. We let them get back up from the hole they dug themselves and all we get for it is them blaming us. What happened Ukraine is not against, or because of America or because of their ""security concerns"". 

How did you ever appease them? They were in deep shit in the 90s lead by a drunk idiot you backed. You let them go down the drain instead of making friends with them, instead being buddies to the US and helping them in their endeavours.

What happened in Ukraine is the result of a pro-Russian government being toppled on their doorstep and replaced by a pro-western one. Any country would flip its shit. Look at how the US reacted in Cuba, it's just that their invasion failed.

&gt;It was and is an attack against the European Union. A nation wants to join our union and they invade them. 

Has it ever crossed your mind that their enemy is the US, not really the EU? The thing with the EU is that for so long it's been an American whore. It often aided the US in its war, they're buddies diplomatically, their host US military bases, etc. And the US proved that even after the Cold War it's no friend of Russia's. If the EU cut ties with the US I guaranty that Russia would be much friendlier, possibly even up for an alliance against the US, as well as China in the future. It would be a good compliment too, Russia's strong military and nuclear arsenal, plus old Cold War ties complimenting the EU's economic strength and current diplomatic ties.

child did not rape that woman, it shouldnt bear the punishment, and i agree, psychological trauma is very real, so dont go smug with me like im telling you giving birth or putting child for adoption is easy, ITS NOT, and i never said otherwise, im saying that DEATH is not equivavelnt to psychological damage, i dont think that choosing between depression or killing someone else is a good choice, let alone you acting like abortion prevents psychological damage and not induces damage like it does

&amp;#x200B;

if you have to be psychologicaly damaged because of giving birth or because of abortion ,wich has more pros and cons? i say the alternative where there are two people alive at the end is always better than just one of them alive, same as one alive is better than both dead, its quite simple

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; A pregnancy is a **major** upheaval to women's body and mind. Hormonal changes are huge and alter the way they think, they eat, they feel about themselves or their surroundings. Their body is changed for the rest of their lives. The main organs take back their original place in months if not years after birth. Then there's the social status change, the responsibilities that you take or that people judge you for not taking. These are potentially deep deep wounds and scars to someone's psyche. 

&amp;#x200B;

i never disputed this, but you overlook that abortion too leaves permament changes to body, carries risks to health, even death on extreme occassions, social stigma and psychological damage inflicted are also great, 

you call me out like i dont know what im talking about but you act like only pregnancy has permanent negative consequencies and risks, abortion carries them too wich you seem to avoid

im not avoiding negative conseqiencies of unwanted pregnancy, im trying to make an argument that when dealing with two bad scenarios, the one where someone dies is objectively and moraly worse than than the one were two live, 

also it is worth mentioning that since such major hormonal and psychological stress pregnancy induces on females, not to mention pressures of their social surrioundings, if its alright to make life or death choices for another human being in that mental state",,/r/europe/comments/d7uocb/50_000_people_were_marching_for_lives_of_unborn/f15bgc6/,Wolf1481,1569187418

I do not agree with you. The health of the mother and of the embryo are not the only relevant parameters. The concerned woman's will and control over her own body is the most important parameter period. In my opinion, the baseline is that women should always be the only ones to decide if and or when she wants an abortion. That said there should be a limit as to when you can have an abortion related to the state of development of the embryo. This should be discussed openly by experts but around the 8th week of pregnancy seems reasonable according to what is scientifically consensual of the embryos development. Its around that time that an embryo becomes a foetus. At that point we can start looking at health parameters and allow abortions when necessary. Not having blue eyes, missing a hand or being a boy/girl doesn't seem enough to justify an abortion I agree with you on that.

There are reviews, word of mouth, gameplay videos, etc. all available for you. They even started to enforce actual gameplay over cinematic trailers to be shown on the store. Plus they have a refund policy in place as well.  
I don't know the future unlike you, but I have to express my concern for one-shot games and single player games that are heavily story based - games such as Undertale; Firewatch, Witcher even, games with little to no replayability that are of high quality can and will suffer the most in my opinion - after all, once you're done with it, there's nothing stopping you to sell the game or even gift it away to a friend who hasn't yet played it and in this case it's a loss for the developer and publisher regardless of the quality of the game.  
I understand that some gamers collect them as novelty and proof, but not everyone think that way.  
As a sidenote, if you purchase an early access game, a pre-order or any unfinished product of any caliber, you get a warning explaining the risks of your purchase. I really don't see how it's Steam's fault if the consumer ignores warnings and ends up with a bad product whining.

If you’re interested in superficial and undigested interpretations of sociological theory I’d suggest rereading (perhaps reading for the first time) your own comments! If you’re interested in forming an entirely different sociological theory that is entirely different from and that fundamentally contradicts Goffman’s “looper” theory, quoting Goffman without providing a substantial amount of material to substantiate you’re own, different theory, is relatively useless.

4099,"&gt;The problem with turning a constitution into a religion or at the very least the main pillar of a regime is that inevitably legitimacy will be lost (and that affects the whole system, constitutional court, chiefdom of state, all), which is a much bigger problem, and that's what's happening in spain.

I agree, I prefer the UK approach, it has risks, but it also has significant benefits and should mean that at any given moment the constitutional settlement is closer to reflecting public opinion and, frankly, reality than say the US constitution. It means that things are reinterpreted and updated as political and public positions change, and significant change still requires significant support.

&gt; Off course the cases of spain and germany are wildly different given that spain is a multi-national state with assimetric levels of devolution between the different nationalities and regions so the constitution is kept relatively vague in some issues and steely cold in others. The UK situation shows the strengths of its system, though, and I can only watch in envy.

To be fair, the UK also has asymmetric levels of devolution (even within entities at the same level, so Scotland vs Wales, or indeed City regions like London vs Manchester etc..), but that is easy to manage as it comes down to primary legislation and political pressure from those areas.

And yeah, I'd say that where some people see problems due to a lack of rigidity in the UK system, or indeed people looking at brexit and seeing it as messy, I'd argue that the messiness is a result of public opinion, it is because the UK is split, because there are differences and because the political system has to take that into account. I would prefer Scotland to remain part of the UK for example, but a system that rigidly defined that and made independence impossible or even just very improbable is not one that I'd see as fair or reasonable compared tothe current set up.

Maybe put cameras near the other points. Or have a few drones looking for trailers where they ought not be. Only if that proves insufficient would one have to start thinking about cutting off rural roads or making them untraversable to heavy traffic.

People keep talking about the border as if they expect a barbed wire fence is going up. I find it hard to believe it would be Ireland or the EU pushing for anything that.",The Netherlands,/r/europe/comments/d7ozlr/juncker_to_uk_dont_blame_brussels_for_postbrexit/f14drzd/,CRE178,1569172975

4176,"That's explicitly the *point* of the document according to the ""Does it matter?"" section of page 4. It's accepted within the community of speakers, but not everyone is actually in that community. While internally they might know what they're talking about, the EU doesn't solely deal with internal matters. At least on face value, the purpose of the paper is to make the EU more intelligible to non-EU diplomats.

...Of course, the fact that they want to standardize to British English fails to actually address the problem, because British English is also filled with a number of words and phrases that would be considered misused or incorrect by the rest of the English-speaking world. 

I do think that the EU should genuinely settle on a specific standard to use, it's almost purely aesthetic. I think that some of the made up words and grammatical mistakes look unprofessional. For the time being though, I think they'd be better off just cutting out the things that are wrong in *every* major version of English, rather than focusing so heavily on things that the British personally don't like. In fact, this focus is self-defeating for the supposed goal of the document itself. There's no way that the EU usage of the word ""dean"" is somehow less confusing than the proposed replacement of ""doyen"".

4258,"If we can't have a debate without calling each other idiots I'll respond in kind: the idea that single player campaigns would flourish and everything would be cool and awesome and bug-free is absolute idiocy. No, devs would implement other monetization models to avoid the disastrous second-hand market.

Just because they're good numbers doesn't make them applicable to any situation. My point is that the behaviour of players would change in such a way that the current business model where a game is sold once will stop working, since the customer can just get the exact same product from the exact same place for cheaper. How is that a sustainable business model?

Numbers from the past are irrelevant, since in that situation people had to go through a lot more trouble to sell their physical copies. If this court decision stands and Valve is forced to implement a second-hand market people can just go boop on the sell button and get it over with. It's not the same as going to a GameStop and getting a shit deal or putting your game on eBay.

Further, about accounts and micro-transactions, I'm using those as kind of placeholders of different strategies that game devs could think of to circumvent the second-hand market. And it would of course be legal, as the court decision only applies to Valve, ie the marketplace itself and not the product. I would further assume that this decision would also apply to the Epic store and others, making them all untenable for a sell-once business model.

That's not a requirement until the last hour. And then it's just a formality.

&gt;You know Lithuania is member of the EU and its approval is required both to make progress and to ultimately join.

Not really no. So was Croatian when they were blocking our chapters and yet... they stopped blocking them without us changing shit to their liking.

&gt;Man aside from being insulting and uncalled for, I really can't overstate how ironic that is. Russia was a thousand times harsher on them than NATO was on you and they were way more innocent. But you're the one calling them butthurt.

It's true though. And yet we don't have nearly as much disagreements with Americans as they with Russians. We're fine with them visiting, we're fine with them living here, we're fine if other countries have nice relations with the US, we certainly don't tell the EU ""If you want us to join you'll have to sour your relations with the US"". Although the EU seems to be doing that 😂

&gt;You said without any evidence. The 2025 date looks more than realistic if not optimistic.

Realistic for what ? As I said no country with border issues can enter. We're not recognizing Kosovo, we'll always have them. How is it realistic ? You implying that EU will withdraw it's recognition ?

&gt;I bet Montenegro will join if it has finished the chapters.

Montenegro has no border issues. Although if we really wanted to be dicks, it'd be pretty easy for Serbia to block Montenegro from joining.

Everyone can understand that Europeans don't want any more wars. But the answer is not to put your head in the sand, claim that war is now unlikely, and ignore all possible risks. 

The relative peace and prosperity of post-WWII Europe is not just some lucky occurrence. It's allowed many countries to concentrate on non-military aspects of their development. A true luxury! But you have to look at why this was possible (hint: it doesn't happen because you're neutral), and hopefully see that it may not be sustainable.

Further, you can't ""buy"" peace only through trade and good relations. Ukraine had massive trade with Russia before the invasions and annexations of 2014, for example.

So far as I am concerned, that is absolutely the right function of using parliamentary facilities, **to invite people from other parts of the world so that we can promote that peace, that understanding and that dialogue. And the idea that an organisation that is dedicated towards the good of the Palestinian people and bringing about long-term peace and social justice and political justice in the whole region should be labelled as a terrorist organisation by the British government is really a big, big historical mistake.”**

Europe is indeed more northerly than the US and still retains a temperate climate.

What North America has that Europe doesn't are the Rocky Mountains. They prevent moist warm air blown by the prevailing westerlies from crossing the North-American continent as far as Prevailing winds bring warm moist air from the Atlantic over Eurasia.

Likewise, if you compare the East Coast of North America with the East coast of Eurasia, you'll find that the two coastlines also have a very similar temperature gradient.

&gt;Not really no. So was Croatian when they were blocking our chapters and yet... they stopped blocking them without us changing shit to their liking.  

Yes really yes. Also I'm far from the mind Lithuania was alone in doing this. That's often how EU diplomacy functions. Have one untouchable member block something while everyone else shrugs and avoids taking a diplomatic hit. If Lithuania relents probably someone else will pop up to do the same.

Yeah because Americans were way kinder to you. Also many Americans regret it. Russians very rarely do.

Also Russia has a conscript Army. Known to be badly paid and equipped with sometimes low morale.

I mean Iraq under Saddam Hussain had also a very large army and PPP was even better for them. Numbers is not all.

And yes they have excellent anti air missle and good nuclear arsenal. But they have problems producing their modern tank in high numbers. 
They are constantly reforming their military and especially are lowering their number of conscripts for more professional soldiers.

While EU military are mostly building up. Increased manpower. Increased research. Increased procurement.

Let's look at Germany known in Reddit to be the leech of NATO. What it plans for the next 11years. 9 new frigates, two additional submarines, 5 new additional Corvettes, new support ships and minewarfare vessel. 1 additional division with all 3(4 if rapid reaction division is counted) completely equipped. Additional more tanks, IVF and other vehicles. Replacing the old typhoons with possible additional one with the newest charge and replacing the tornadoes.

It was a military dictatorship. You're just using the word as a blanket ""those bad guys"". 

&gt;Brave king 

Boohoo. Antonescu started negociations in '43 with the western allies because everyone and their dog in Romania had known for a century that you do not under any circumstane make any kind of deal with the russians. In parallel, the old parties were doing their own negotiations, again, with the western allies. In this whole equation nobody gave the slightest shit about muh king. Two months before the brave coupists went ahead, the soviets even accepted an armistice proposal. The coup itself was just an attempt to save high ranking asses, not to actually achieve peace. And because everyone knew what dealing with Russians would entail, I doubt anyone with half a brain were shocked after they took over.

As for games with micro-transactions (or some other way if monetization) of course you wouldn't be able to sell those games as they'd be free initially. That's the whole point why it would be a viable business model.

Single player games would get unnecessary ""accounts"" and other stuff like that to tie the user to the game. If it would go as you say, they would just be resold after the 30 hours instead of the 8, so no difference.

According to Innocence Project there are 2.3 — 5% of innocent in american prisons.

As for Russia, nobody knows, according to ЕУ estimation about 40000 cases related to drugs only were fabricated [1], but 99% conviction rates give a hint. Confessions through the torture, refutal of evidences etc are a norm in Russian courts.

Recently the scale of a problem became visible because of many literary political activists faced the system, and the facts of tortures, fake evidences, fake expert reports, provocations became visible. According to Institute for Law Enforcement cops and judges just do to the activists what they are used to do, this kind of judicial process is a norm [2].

Anyone who thinks the industry in the future will function exactly the same with the exception of you being able to sell your game is delusional, the developers are not stupid, they will definitely change how they deliver their products, and it's won't be for the better.

Politically, Protestants were practically without any power, being excluded from the court of the King and any position of importance. The Thirty Years war started in Bohemia as an attempt by these Protestants to secure legal protection and political representation for themselves.  
  
Unfortunately for them, the Protestant army was crushed at the Battle of White Mountain. In the aftermath, the population of Bohemia was aggressively reconverted to Catholicism. Protestantism was wiped out.

Bohemian lands are one unique in the sense that we can trace nationality back to the fucking 7th century. Even in high middle ages there are sources as what actually meant to be ""Bohemian"" and there are many sources of xenophobia towards non-""Bohemians"" of the time.

John the Blind could attest. When he came to the throne he was shunned for not being a proper Bohemian (which was cultural rather than lingustic at those times), both German-Bohemian nobles and Czech-Bohemian nobles told him to shut the fuck up and let them do their thing.

Charles IV, his son, was accepted mainly because he was deemed as a proper Bohemian (Premyslid blood+partly Bohemian upbringing+actually speaking Czech and German no problemo).

Nationality was not ""fluid"" it was real proper deal breaker and I can assure you that many German-Bohemians were pulling with Czech-Bohemians against Austrians, because fuck em, they are not Bohemian.

Its actually interesting read, you can find these anti-foreign tendencies littered everywhere in Czech history, hailing both from Germans who lived here and Czechs alike...

4768,"&gt; I am not at any moment ""using their stuff"". I am not stealing from them. I have never even seen them. I just saw a picture of their super-duper-protected ""art"", copied it, and I am now selling it. In which way am I limiting their freedom?

If there is a contract involved in using their art you are breaking that contract. You do not need to explicitly sign a contract to be part of it. However we were talking about games, not pictures of art. 

&gt; Because if you're gonna say ""I'm limiting their freedom of monopolizing that one piece of art"" I might agree, but that is exactly not a free market. Where is the competition -- the buyer freedom? the seller freedom?

You are stuck on the idea that freedom means you get to do whatever you want and fuck those others. Free market means buyer and seller get to make the contract they want to. Buyer doesn’t have to buy if they don’t want to and seller doesn’t want to sell if they don’t want to. If seller refuses to sell they monopolize their property and that is free market. If seller says you can buy this but not sell it further that is still entirely free market and you are not in any way required to buy the product. 

Taking pictures of art has more to do with unauthorized copying of products. That is very much a different problem. 

&gt; Let's leave the metaphilosphy for another day. This is a free market. There is some stuff that needs to happen for a free market to work -- e.g. private property. But stuff such as intellectual property or anti resale clauses or anti compete clauses are just artificial addons which are not in any way part of a ""free market"".

Everything in buying and selling is an artificial add on. The price is an artificial add on. Wouldn’t it be much more free if you were free to just take whatever you want. Clearly the seller is monopolizing their property if they do not give it to you. 

No. In perfectly free market the seller is free to monopolize however they want to and you are free not to buy from them if you don’t like it. 

&gt; I definitely need to enter it willingly, though.

If you are aware of it and choose to buy or use the products with the contract involved then you are entering it willingly. If you do not wish to enter a contract do not use the product.",Finland,/r/europe/comments/d7b7em/french_court_rules_steam_users_have_right_to/f11xs7e/,jaaval,1569132052

Twilight is still night untill a sunrise occurs.

Polar twilight is a subset of polar night, it is just a more precise description, and not something entirely different.

There is however always a catch, this is what some EU officials are complaining about.
2. In total percentage, trade with Russia barely reaches 10 percent (for 2017). So, although it is significant in absolute value, no one would want to lose that kind of money from trade in Serbia, overall you do most of your trade with your neighbours and the EU.
3. Given the nature of Russia's markets, it actually doesn't make a lot of sense to economically align with them. Russia is very poor and economically undeveloped; with the exception of some very specific products and raw resources there's not a lot of trade Serbia can do with them.

5092,"Mary Rambaran-Olm speaks at an academic conference in Washington earlier this month, at which she announced her plans to resign as second vice president of the group formerly known as the International Society of Anglo-Saxonists. (Leah Newsom)
By Hannah Natanson September 19
Mary Rambaran-Olm hates drama.

So, in one of the most dramatic moments of her life — as she took the podium at an academic conference to resign from a prestigious medieval studies group over its alleged racism, sexism and ties to white supremacy — she kept things simple. She wasn’t nervous, she didn’t tremble; she didn’t even bother to prepare notes.

Facing several hundred people in an auditorium in downtown Washington this month, Rambaran-Olm spoke for less than a minute: The International Society of Anglo-Saxonists (ISAS) was encouraging and emboldening white supremacists, she said, an attitude typified by its refusal to change its name. Rambaran-Olm, a woman of color, was stepping down as the group’s second vice president, effective immediately.

“I just said what I had to say,” Rambaran-Olm, a 41-year-old academic researcher who lives in Ireland, said later. “I didn’t understand at the time what ripple effect it was going to have — I didn’t think it was going to snowball.”

Snowball it did.

On Tuesday, following multiple resignations and outraged statements from other medieval groups condemning its actions, ISAS formally voted to alter its name, bowing to critics who argue that “Anglo Saxon” is code for whiteness, a phrase that is co-opted today by white supremacists around the world to advance a false version of white-dominated history.

It was a landmark moment for the group and for medieval studies. ISAS, one of the largest and longest-standing scholarly associations in the field, holds a highly regarded conference every two years that attracts scholars across the globe. Presenting at the event as a young scholar is “a huge deal” that can make your career, according to Erik Wade, a visiting lecturer at the University of Bonn who studies Old English literature and history.

But the battle over the term “Anglo Saxon” has implications beyond ISAS: It’s emblematic of broader issues roiling the world of medieval studies, Wade said. Over the past two weeks, Rambaran-Olm’s actions have forced the field into a contentious debate about the ways its past and present scholarship may reinforce white supremacy, a reckoning some are hailing as long overdue.

“The name change encapsulates a much larger issue of how medieval studies must wrestle with its own disciplinary history of racism and its connections to whiteness,” Wade said. “When something as small as changing an organization’s name generates this kind of pushback, that suggests how entrenched these hierarchies are.”

About 75 percent of ISAS’s 582 members participated in the vote to change the group’s name, and the motion passed with a roughly 60 percent majority, according to an email obtained by The Washington Post.


“There will of course follow a process for suggesting, discussing, and selecting a new name,” former ISAS executive director Robin Norris wrote in the email. “We apologize to our colleagues of color who have experienced the name of our society as just one of many microaggressions they have faced in academia.”

The switch came too late for some, and too soon for others. In the wake of Rambaran-Olm’s speech, ISAS suffered a steady drip of resignations from rank-and-file members and top leadership on both sides of the issue. Its advisory board of nine is down to just four.

ISAS President Timothy Graham declined to comment, and Norris did not respond to a request for comment. Rebecca Stephenson, the second Vice President of ISAS, wrote in a “collective statement” on behalf of the advisory board Thursday that the organization is “strongly committed to transparent progress on these important matters.”


The “term ‘Anglo-Saxonist’ is problematic. It has sometimes been used outside the field to describe those holding repugnant and racist views, and has contributed to a lack of diversity among those working on early medieval England and its intellectual and literary culture,” the statement reads in part. “We are grateful for the patience and support of our members as we begin to rebuild bridges between the divisions in the Society.”

In her email to ISAS members, Norris said the board was saddened by all the resignations and admitted: “We made you wait too long for change.”

“Mary’s resignation has raised difficult questions that will require a longer process of self-reckoning and evaluation on the part of the Society … the board pledges to effect changes,” Norris wrote. She concluded the message with the first of those changes: “With that, I resign as your Executive Director.”


Rambaran-Olm said she thinks ISAS is “taking a good first step” by changing its name. But much more must be done — and much more is at stake, she said.

It was never just about a name, said Eileen Fradenburg Joy, a scholar in the field and a former ISAS member.

“The entire field of medieval studies is undergoing massive upheaval because they have not dealt with long-standing issues of racism and sexism,” Joy said. “This name change controversy is sowing the fault lines that still exist between white scholars — because it’s all white people, a bunch of white people arguing over whether they’re racist.”

The discipline of English medieval studies — which is overwhelmingly white — focuses on literature, art and culture produced between roughly A.D. 500 and 1500 in England. Key texts studied include “Beowulf” and Geoffrey Chaucer’s “The Canterbury Tales.”

White supremacists have recently sought to revive this period of history as proof of white racial superiority, pointing in part to the era’s literary achievements as evidence that white society was far ahead of other cultures, according to Wade. They also see it as a time “of pure masculinity, some sort of warrior culture where men could be men,” Wade said.

Medieval symbols and references to historians of that era have cropped up at white nationalist and neo-Nazi rallies, including the deadly 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville. The gunman suspected in the 2019 New Zealand shooting that left 51 dead scrawled 18 references to the Middle Ages on his weaponry, according to medieval historian Paul B. Sturtevant.

The term “Anglo Saxon” has come to symbolize this particular vision of white medieval dominance, Wade said — a vision that is completely wrong for several reasons.

First of all, it was not a “monolithic white period”: People immigrated to England from all over (including places like Greece and North Africa), and would not have described themselves as “Anglo Saxon” at the time, said Wade, who resigned as a member of ISAS this week to show support for Rambaran-Olm.

Second, Wade said, people living in the region were not the insular and self-important bunch that white supremacists want them to be. The English did not “think of themselves as the center of the world,” according to Wade, and in fact looked to other societies for inspiration and education.",Frankenland,/r/europe/comments/d7ie6c/allegations_of_white_supremacy_are_tearing_apart/f108wh6/,weneedabetterengine,1569109035
5093,"Some of the most revered medieval texts draw heavily on literature produced by Spanish monks. Many in England were “totally obsessed” with travelogues about India and Egypt, Wade said. One prominent English king modeled currency on coins produced in Islam and another wrote to people in the Arab Empire asking for medical advice.

“This idea that they were not influenced by North Africa or the Middle East, all of these places, is just ridiculous,” Wade said. “They’re really, really trying to model themselves on this other part of the world.”

The false historical narrative that white people — in particular, Anglo Saxon people — were the only race to produce worthwhile literature, art and scientific discoveries during the Middle Ages took root when “professional medieval studies” launched in Britain in the late 1700s, according to Wade. At the time, the British Empire wanted to justify its colonization of other countries around the globe, so it was “politically convenient” to develop a view that the English had “always been superior,” Wade said.

That way of thinking became entrenched as the field developed, according to Wade, and still shapes the discipline today — informing who gets hired, who gets published, who gets tenure.

“This field … it’s just incredibly self-satisfied, smug, elitist, white and male,” Joy said.

Rambaran-Olm didn’t know all this when she chose to pursue a career in medieval studies. She just knew she’d fallen in love with the subject.

Her admiration began during childhood in Canada, when her father (a “huge Middle Ages fan”) introduced her to literary figures such as Robin Hood. Her passion was confirmed in college when she discovered “Beowulf.”

“I was just fascinated with Old English, this language that seemed so foreign but it was our language, my language,” Rambaran-Olm said. “I thought that medieval studies was something for me, too — until I found out that clearly it wasn’t.”

Professors and advisers made Rambaran-Olm feel alien and unwelcome countless times over the years, she said. Turning her down for a job, someone told her, “We couldn’t figure out how to justify to our students that you are an Anglo-Saxonist.” Teachers consistently professed amazement that she was interested in the field.

Still, she stuck with it, determined not to become one of the countless “people of color who leave silently,” she said. She joined ISAS in 2005 and, when the opportunity arose in 2017 to serve as second vice president, she jumped at it.

The organization is highly prestigious among medieval scholars (“a huge deal,” Wade said), so it was a possible boon to her career. More than that, Rambaran-Olm thought she could push for change from within, using her position of power for good.

“I was hoping I could reach not just the organization but work to make changes within our field, because our field is just laden with so many problems,” Rambaran-Olm said. “Too many people have left because of racism and sexism. … I’m one of the only people of color in the field.”

In her new role, she immediately began seeking to reform ISAS. She fought to introduce a sexual harassment policy and to “dismantle racism within the organization” by making it more inclusive of people of color, she said.

Of course, she also pushed for a name change — an idea first proposed by Adam Miyashiro, an associate professor of literature at Stockton University who wrote an open letter to ISAS in 2017 in part outlining the “racist understanding” of the term Anglo-Saxon. Miyashiro again made the case for changing the name at ISAS’s conference this year in Albuquerque.

“My argument was that we need to at least seriously consider the racist and white supremacist history about how that term has been used,” Miyashiro said in an interview. “This is not something we can run away from.""

For two years, every change Rambaran-Olm proposed met with “endless and total stonewalling” from ISAS’s board, she said. This month, following yet another disappointing board meeting, she decided she’d had enough.

In the hours before the Washington conference on Sept. 7, she called her mother and various academic advisers to talk through her plans to quit. Everyone agreed: It simply “wasn’t worth it” anymore. She did not want to do hard, lonely and pointless battle with the board for years to come.

ISAS’s vote this week hasn’t changed Rambaran-Olm’s mind. She has no wish to rejoin the group, she said, no matter what it’s called.

But she’s not giving up on medieval studies.

“I have a number of articles and two books in the works,” Rambaran-Olm said. “I just think — well, there are things to say, and if people are willing to publish it, I’m going to say them.”",Frankenland,/r/europe/comments/d7ie6c/allegations_of_white_supremacy_are_tearing_apart/f108x4x/,weneedabetterengine,1569109042

It lives in seawater, and can infect an open wound. Generally warmer water is more dangerous. However, it is actually very rare.

It also runs counter to the widespread rumor that seawater is naturally antiseptic, so there's probably a sort of a surprise bias working in it's favor.

Nice was never « largely Italian-speaking », it was Provençal-speaking with an Italian-speaking bourgeoisie. Much like Strasbourg was German-speaking with an educated French-speaking minority, for example. It only ended up under the Savoie crown for what I remember to be a tax rebellion (war of the Union of Aix).

Menton was **never** part of the County of Nice, but of the principality of Monaco and was annexed during the Revolution.

5271,"&gt;When You pay for software, it'll be changed over time. ""For free"". This is why software that gets updated online can't (or should not be) reselled. It's not like examples above.

Except it is, because you pay for it once and get the benefit from it as long as you wish to hold on to it. If you used it for 20 years, the seller would still only get the same amount of money, there is no loss to the publisher in you selling it (in the same way you might sell a physical CD, or a processor). You can no-longer use it, someone else can. The argument from the publishers is that they should be able to control resale, that isn't somehow a given in that circumstance. If they were selling a subscription, you'd have a point to a degree, except there would be no difference between transferring a subscription and buying a new one in most cases.

&gt;If You bought Doom on a floppy, You were free to sell that floppy to anyone. But the update/content-patch/expansion/sequel, Doom 2 - was a new product.

Sure..

&gt;Today games get more changes in a single update, than Doom 2 got in new, standalone release from Doom 1. 

That's true for some games, not for others, and it's the choice that publishers make, but again, you only pay for it once, and can not use it once you have sold it. So there is no loss in you selling it to another person and are no longer able to make use of it..

&gt;Do You see where my issue is? If You bought No Man's Sky - You didn't had to pay for the update that made the game totally different/better. Because it's digital. You can't have it both ways.

That's not having it both ways. The point is that if you own it, you can use it (updates or no, etc..) if you no longer have a need for it, why can't you sell it to someone else to make use of as you would have done had you kept it? There is no physical reason why it'd be different, no practical reason either. It comes down to what we think is fair. And again, if you spend £60 on something, then no-longer want it and see no further utility in it, why shouldn't you be able to sell it to someone else who might want to make use of it?

&gt;And sorry i sound butthurt, but as a small, indie-dev - this is just terrible idea, that will not affect big publishers (Madden '18, '19' '20, they don't care), but will affect people like me, that work on a single game for years.

I understand the issues within the industry, I have written and sold software in the past (on a service model generally, although VOIP systems rather than games) as a small business. It's a nightmare to compete and one of the small, but consequential elements I had at that time that most of my larger competitors didn't was that my customers owned (and could indeed resell..) the software that I'd written and put together (and indeed share the open-source components...).  My problem is that the industry (generally the large houses, I'm in Sheffield so I know quite a few Indy devs who all seem to take a much more reasonable approach..) is abusing its customer base, both by revenue maximisation approaches, but that includes a slew of things including an attempt to restrict resale.  There is no good reason, beyond revenue generation, that a game can't be resold.",United Kingdom - Personally vouched for by /u/colourfox,/r/europe/comments/d7b7em/french_court_rules_steam_users_have_right_to/f0zdv71/,-ah,1569092964

5274,"&gt; The Roman hosted many Etruscan and Latin refugees in the early stages of  the city and later managed to successful integrate and use Germanic and  African economical immigrants for at least a century and a half before  corruption and a million other things made this integration ineffective.

Sure, but the disatisfaction currently seems to broadly be about national issues that would be federal issues in Germany as much as they are national issues in the UK at present. Things like spending priorities and investment are after all allocated regionally and then generally spent regionally.

&gt;The Yorkshire and NRW administrations might work similarly in the end, but the way the people in those administrations ended up in those positions is just as important as the work they do.

Sure.. Local government is elected though, it's not as though Westminster is the only layer of elected governance in a UK context.

&gt;They also expand the level of political engagement, as previously disenfranchised or disillusioned people feel like they have another opportunity to make their voices heard. Personally, I believe it overall decreases the levels of political dissatisfaction, even it is marginal.

Local elections, Mayoral elections, PCC elections and so on tend to get vastly fewer people taking part unless they align with National elections, although I'd agree that that is driven by apathy from a feeling that it makes little different (which is daft because local government tends to have more of an impact than national government does in an immediate sense).",United Kingdom - Personally vouched for by /u/colourfox,/r/europe/comments/d77x6h/the_scottish_people_are_on_the_brink_of_backing/f0z3icy/,-ah,1569085476

That we can agree on for sure. The early DW books read as a parody of LOTR-like fantasy. And you see that during the series certain ideas get developed and some ideas don't really work and disappear. That's why I believe that the dwarf bread started as a parody of elven bread: instead of needing one bite that fills, the threat of needing to eat it keeps you going.

But why? Just like Nigeria has black people Britain has too. It's not about any narrative, but if the director thinks Gyasi was the best one to portray Achilles, than that's that. Nobody of them ever claimed he was black, nobody is pretending that Achilleus was black. Gyasi himself talked about that in some interview. 

&gt; But there's something about the way it's marketed that seems deliberately provocative, like it's begging for someone to post it on twitter raging about Achilles being black and for another one to come up with a smug reply about ""muh historical accuracy"". 

I mean yeah? Probably? But that doesn't make the outrage any less ridiculous. 


&gt; And about Achilles being a Scottish guy, I get your point. While he is described as blonde and fair, the chances of him resembling an Anglo-Saxon are slim, but at the very least it's consistent. I bet people would react differently if a black/white man played someone like Sun Wukong

5676,"Read the whole thing before acting so smug: 

&gt;In the wake of the ruling, parish **schools were closed**. A shortage of teachers led to the closure of a number of state schools as well, in spite of population growth. Parents began to withdraw their children from the state schools, since they were associated with the policy of Russification; **students were not allowed to speak Lithuanian among themselves**, and a discouraging atmosphere was created by the system of searches, inspections, and spying. Many students were schooled at home or in small secret groups instead, although this practice also **resulted in sanctions**.

Among others things like mass settlement of Russians into Lithuanian territory.

In adiditon: 

&gt; The years 1869-1885 saw the systematic removal of the Polish language from the **education system**, the end result, in 1885, was its placement *as a second, uncompulsory school language*. Only **religion was taught in Polish**. Dmitry Ilovaysky's history text books were enforced in school history classes, falsifying history and as such continually implemented Russification. Additionally, the Russian language was introduced into folk schools. Conclusively, speaking the Polish language was banned in **institutions of education**. There was also **an attempt** to introduce the Cyrillic alphabet into Polish. 

That's not ""Polish wasn't even allowed to be spoken in public."", genius. 

Note ""Only religion was taught in Polish."" and ""was its placement as a second, uncompulsory school language"". It wasn't banned outright. It was banned only in institutions of education not in public contrary to Lithuania. Meanwhile religion in Lithuania was still taught in Polish. That's what I mean. 

I never said that there was no russification in Poland and I never compared that Lithuanian or Polish people had it better or worse. I was talking about the language and Polish was the language of nobility and clergy so it still got a pass (ie in church)

And what do they get? A slap on the wrist at worst.

Frankly it's our fault as well. People just don't get steamed up about this sort of fraud because in general its just too mind boggling. Too complex. And too brazen to conceive of.

5990,"**Translation here :**

To combat the scourge of congestion and pollution, many large cities are seeking to limit car traffic and even ban cars, starting with the most polluting. A long and difficult battle, especially as many continue to see their populations grow.
An overview of the measures adopted by five major European cities to combat air contamination and transform modes of transport on their territory.

**I.
Oslo without cars, an old and far from won battle**

Between the central station to the west, the royal castle to the east, and Oslo Fjord to the south, Kvadraturen, the historic centre of the Norwegian capital, built in the 17th century, fits into a handkerchief. It is this part of the city that the municipality is clearing cars. An area of 1.3 square kilometres, where barely a thousand inhabitants live, crossed daily by 100,000 people going to work.


The decision was taken by the majority just elected in 2015, composed of the left and the Greens. Its completion should have been completed this year. It finally took longer than expected to implement an extremely controversial project, which even led to threats and harassment on social networks by the deputy mayor in charge of the environment, the ecologist Lan Marie Nguyen Berg.

The car problem in Oslo is not new, however. In 1990, tolls were installed at the entrance to the city. As the population is growing rapidly (+10,000 inhabitants per year), traffic has not decreased. Benefits were then granted to electric vehicles: free tolls and parking, permission to drive in bus lanes... A success since in 2018, one third of the vehicles registered in Norway were electric.

But Oslo wants to go even further, by setting up a ""car-free centre"", a new step towards the objective of reducing its CO2 emissions by 36% by 2020 (compared to 2009) and 95% by 2030. Since 2018, the 760 public parking spaces have been eliminated. One by one, the streets are closed to cars.

Beyond the ecological aspect, the municipality has made it a question of living well. To overcome the resistance of the inhabitants, it highlights the new activities that can be developed there. In 2017, six pilot projects were launched to test different solutions: widened bicycle paths, terraces, green spaces, games... Some of them have been made permanent. Others abandoned, such as this outdoor workstation, equipped with Wi-Fi and lighting, converted into goat shelters outside Oslo.

The result: according to a survey published in November 2018, 47% of merchants' opinions are negative, with most saying that the ""purging"" of cars in the centre has caused them to lose customers, while two thirds of residents say they are satisfied. The majority committed to continue their efforts if they were to be renewed in September, following the upcoming municipal elections.",Alsace (France),/r/europe/comments/d7730w/five_examples_of_large_european_cities_that_want/f0xuptz/,-Golvan-,1569047841

5992,"**II. London**

In central London, the private car has become a rarity. In forty years, their number at morning rush hour has halved. In Greater London as a whole (the equivalent of Ile-de-France), the decline has been 15% in twenty years.

And yet, the centre of the British capital still suffers from serious traffic jams and air pollution. Londoners have never taken their cars so little (now less than one trip per day per person) but the difficulties of transporting nearly 9 million people remain considerable.

The decline in car use began in the 1980s and continued with the introduction of urban tolls in 2003. On weekdays, between 7 a.m. and 6 p.m., a motorist must pay £11.50 (€13) daily to be able to drive in the city centre. The amount is enough of a deterrent that it is now really rare to work by car in these neighbourhoods (about 5%).

But the urban toll covers only a small area: it is 21 square kilometres, a fifth of Paris within the city walls. Its introduction has only shifted the problem; pollution on the surrounding roads has increased. In addition, London has been facing an explosion in the number of vans and chauffeur-driven passenger vehicles (VTCs), both of which are exempt from urban tolls, for the past decade. The delivery of orders over the Internet on the one hand and the success of Uber on the other hand have intensified traffic jams.

To cope with this, London has invested heavily in buses and metros over the past twenty years. The old reputation of lines constantly breaking down is no longer justified. But then again, it's overflowing everywhere. During rush hour, it is not uncommon to have to let several subway trains pass by to be able to sneak into a wagon.

In this context, and with an expected increase of two million people within 20 years, London Mayor Sadiq Khan has set a target: that 80% of trips within Greater London will be made on foot, by bicycle or by public transport by 2041, compared to 63% today.

No magic wand to achieve this, but an all-round approach. A charging zone of 15 euros per day for polluting vehicles (particularly old diesels) was set up in April in the city centre, and will be extended in 2021 to the equivalent of the Parisian small belt. Important cycle paths have been built, although they are often not separated from cars. Crossrail, a kind of new east-west RER line, will open in 2020, and another north-south line is under study. However, the battle for urban transport in London is far from won.",Alsace (France),/r/europe/comments/d7730w/five_examples_of_large_european_cities_that_want/f0xuryz/,-Golvan-,1569047929
5993,"**III. Barcelona's ""superilles"" are multiplying**

Count about three blocks long and three blocks wide, about nine ""islets"". Limit traffic within these ""super islets"" to authorized vehicles only (public transport, residents, emergencies, etc.). Rake the pavement as much as possible and reduce the speed to 10 kilometres per hour. Change the direction of the streets to form loops and prevent them from being used as shortcuts. Turn all intersections into large pedestrian spaces. File sidewalks, add street furniture so that the street becomes a space for meeting and living, and games so that children can reclaim the city. Draw athletic tracks, poems and labyrinths on the ground. There you will have superilles in Catalan or supermanzanas in Castilian, symbol of Barcelona's new urban policy.

In four years, the mayor of the Mediterranean city, former housing rights activist Ada Colau, inaugurated five of them. Not all of them are at the same stage of development. Some are more successful, integrated, green and successful than others.

The first, located in the popular district of Poble Nou and inaugurated in 2016, was surrounded by a heated controversy, stirred by traders and companies affected by the reduction in car traffic on this 15 hectare area. But after the initial reluctance, local residents, pedestrians or cyclists, succumbed to the model that allowed them to regain 25,000 square metres of public space, taken from cars. According to the city hall, two years later, the number of businesses on the ground floor has increased by 30% and traffic inside the super-island has dropped by nearly 60%.

From this first experience, the town hall drew lessons: the supermanzanas of Sant Antoni, La Horta, Hostafrancs and La Maternitat were designed in collaboration with neighbourhood associations to obtain the greatest possible consensus, so that residents understand that the super-islands return a large part of the urban space consumed by motorized traffic.

""Pedestrians, public transport and bicycles must have direct and fast roads, while private vehicles must be made more difficult to get through because if we create highways, they will use them,"" says Janet Sanz, the municipal assistant for ecology. The objective of the supermanzanas is also to contribute to the 45% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2030 to which the municipality has committed itself.

Before the local elections on 26 May, three new super-island projects were launched in the heart of the city, in the Eixample and Sant Gervasi districts. Mrs. Colau, who came a few votes behind the pro-independence Ernest Maragall and is in negotiations with other parties to keep the town hall, intends to implement them.",Alsace (France),/r/europe/comments/d7730w/five_examples_of_large_european_cities_that_want/f0xuu3f/,-Golvan-,1569048015
