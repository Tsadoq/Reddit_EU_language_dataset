20,"&gt; Again, they are called Gauls, and they are the ones from current France, the romans called them ""Galli"", but it´s still wrong. ""Gallic"" is something from Gallia (modern western France) or from the celtic Galli people.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaelic_Ireland
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaels

""Not to be confused with Gauls.""

&gt; Speaking a different language doesn´t necesarilly constitute a different ethnicity. Besides they have been intermarring for generations. There are variants but they are minimal.

What about the different genetic mixes between the north and the south.

&gt; Pushed out of what exactly? They colonized the island. Also the concept of ""english"" pre-dates the Norman invasions by centuries, even the Anglo-Saxons were refered as ""English"" The name ""England"" is derived from the Old English name Englaland, which means ""land of the Angles"". The Angles were one of the Germanic tribes that settled in Great Britain, alonside the Saxons and the Jutes.

As in they pushed out the native population rather than mixed with them for the most part. ""They colonized the island"" it's not like the islands were uninhibited before they got there, they migrated over and displaced a different ethnic group. ""England is derived from the Old English name Englaland, which means ""land of the Angles"" Yes but the concept of england predates the concept of the english by a very long time.

&gt; Many people do refer to themselves as that, I know, even some Americans call themselves ""Anglos"", but the correct term is still ""English""

But english encompasses multiple ethnic groups so no it's not the correct term for an ethnic group, it's a national group and a cultural group.

&gt; It is uncertain how many people in Wales consider themselves to be of Welsh ethnicity, because the 2001 UK census did not offer 'Welsh' as an option; respondents had to use a box marked ""Other"".

Though in 2011 64.6% of wales identified as welsh as part of nationality question. 
And this is what the most recent census question about ethnic background actually looked like https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6d/2011_UK_census_ethnic_group_question.png you'll notice it asks about white british, asian british and black british as the british is not seen as part of the ethnic group.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/bet5j1/map_of_ethnically_homogeneous_countries_in_europe/el8regg/,arran-reddit,1555646907

94,"&gt;I know. So that you can make assumptions about me.

Oh, I haven't had to make an assumption about you in quite some time - you've proven my initial hypothesis regarding your overall outlook and attitude with every post you make.

You've linked to this article:

[https://www.sott.net/article/411378-Chief-engineer-of-Notre-Dame-That-fires-flames-needed-an-accelerant-to-reach-and-burn-the-churchs-ancient-oak-beams](https://www.sott.net/article/411378-Chief-engineer-of-Notre-Dame-That-fires-flames-needed-an-accelerant-to-reach-and-burn-the-churchs-ancient-oak-beams) 

That website is ""Sign of the Times"".  Looking at some of their other articles it's pretty hardcore right-wing, with a few conspiracy and paranormal/news of the weird pieces thrown in for good measure.  Not what I'd call a neutral or unbiased source.

But, once again, you're being selective in who you believe.  This person's reputation and credentials are enough to satisfy your truth threshold, but the official statements from the people directly involved with the fire are suspect, to you?  You continue to be wildly inconsistent with your acceptance of authority.

That said, let's take a look at what he's quoted as saying, and see if we can't further our debate.

&gt;""I don't understand this at all. The fire's spread is extremely curious. With really old oak like that, it's super-hard, so you'd need a lot of smaller wood to first get the fire hot enough for the oak beams to burn.

Sorry, where does he say ""practically mineralized""?  Also, could you please explain what you mean by ""mineralized""?

&gt;In 2010 we replaced all the electrical wiring, so there's no way this was sparked by a short-circuit. We put new wiring in place according to modern standards. And we went even further; we installed state-of-the-art fire protection and detection systems in the cathedral.

Aside from those tools that generate fire as their primary function, such as welding torches, plenty of power tools generate electrical arcs within their housing as a part of normal function.  Aside from that, while I appreciate the faith this man has in his work, you'll find we live in a universe subject to entropy.

&gt;At all times, there are always two men on standby in the Cathedral, day and night, to go investigate anything the moment an alarm goes off, then if necessary to call the fire emergency services.

I'm pretty sure I read in one of the other articles you linked previously that those people responded to multiple alarms and didn't find the fire until it was out of control, at which point they called emergency services.

&gt;Old oak that is practically mineralized, difficult to burn.

This is the new ""jet fuel can't melt steel beams"", I take it.

&gt;Modern electrical wiring

Which I'm sure prevented a fair number of fires.

&gt;State of the art fire detection systems

Which worked as intended and detected the fire as early as 5:45 or 5:50, IIRC, but wasn't found by the...

&gt;Two people on alert in case there is any sign of fire

Who responded when the alarm sounded, and were unable to locate the fire until it was too large for them to control, at which point they contacted emergency services

&gt;No electrical appliances allowed in the attic

Without knowing where ""the attic"" is in relation to where the renovations were going on, that doesn't really mean anything.

&gt; Can’t wait to see the full results of the investigation!

You dodged my question, so I'll repeat it:  upon the conclusion of the investigation, you will unequivocally accept the official statement regarding the fire's origin?",,/r/europe/comments/bdil88/notre_dame_is_on_fire/el8uy14/,GearBrain,1555650366

No. A group of the celts native to some parts of the british isles. Ireland and west coast of scotland.

&gt; Scot and Scottish are sinonims

Only to those who don't know the different ethnocultural groups of scotland. Scots are from the south of scotland.

&gt; Highlander has never been an ethnicity ""per se"", it´s a form of self-identification, yes, but not an ethnicity.

Apart from the different ethnic background to the scots in the south, the speaking a different language, more than a thousand years of cultural differences. 

&gt; The Anglo-saxons were a germanic group that blended with other groups in the southern part of Great Britain to form the current English identity

By blend you mean pushed out for the most part and the idea of the ""english"" only really came about post norman conquest.

No thats what the majority of english people are defined as.

&gt;Yes. That is my point.

Which includes normal legal migrants.

&gt;They are denied asylum and yet left without any oversee. In many cases deportation is impossible due to unwillingness of their native country to issue documents. In many others, they go off the grid. The later part can be solved by closed processing center.
All this reminds me is that I've been waiting for new book for 8 bloody years.
With little repercussion unless you are citizen of EE or Balkan country. Closed centers end the ""go on the streets"" system which regularly ends up with migrant disappearing and going either asylum shopping or living permanently illegally.

This was and still is a competency of national governments, so I don't see how that has to do with EU policy.

&gt;There is this thing down south called Mediterranean Sea which is filled with both commercial and military ships and tons of air assets. Intercept-and-return is what Australia did. Intercept-and-return is something that EU doesn't do. Instead, EU ships ferry the intercepted migrants to EU territory.

465,"&gt; The video shows me a leader of a mob, so I’m sorry, I still don’t see the pacifism.

A man speaking to a multitude in a demonstration he didn't organized, asking for pacifism, seems pretty pacifist.

&gt; Instead of manifestos, they should start judiciary processes against those judges for acting in an unlawful way. Don’t you think?

Those judges have a lot of power, and political power. There's no way you can remove them easily.

Remember what happened when those messages were leaked, about PP leaders saying in their private WhatsApp group that they were going to control the Catalan trial using their appointed judge? [""Controlando la Sala Segunda desde detrás"": el 'whatsapp' de Cosidó justificando el pacto con el PSOE en el CGPJ](https://www.elespanol.com/espana/politica/20181119/controlaremos-sala-segunda-cosido-justificando-psoe-cgpj/354214577_0.html). Nothing happened to that judge. And most judges at the Supreme Court are politically controlled.

Without a major reform instating a real separation of powers in Spanish judiciary, no much can be done.

&gt; The fact that you thought I was trolling with my documented comments and my lack of insults perfectly portraits what I don’t like about the Independentist Movement.

Is that a lot ? Not, but that's literally living in London on minimum wage (1.5k being the minimum wage, though in reality I doubt many if any jobs in London pay \*that\* badly once you factor in tips &amp; benefits).

&amp;#x200B;

But add to that model \~200-500 that said person can get from the government in benefits (e.g. subsidies for renting), and you've actually got yourself someone that can can at least 600 a month, on minimum wage.

&amp;#x200B;

Considering how few people are on minimum wage, I find it hard to believe that 35% of UKs population is ""struggling"" just because of an ""unjust"" system. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's some fault of their own that causes the hardship, spending to get a status symbol (phone, suit, car, watch), having kids young, an addiction (gambling, smoking, stimulants) or just basic consumerism (traveling to tourist traps, buying useless shit from amazon... etc). 

&amp;#x200B;

Should we \*punish\* them for those faults ? No, I'm not claiming we should do that, that's a shit way to handle it. We should help relieve said financial pressure. But if you keep assuming said financial pressure is from ""mean capitalism"" and not due to other factors you are just going to keep throwing money at the problem when what you actually need is a different solution (education, banning said addictive behaviors... or maybe making them cheaper and safer if banning is impossible, encouraging people not to have kids so young by providing free contraceptives and abortions... etc).

&amp;#x200B;

And I say this as someone who comes from a family that was considered poor in a poor European country, I've live in ""council hosing"" for most of my life (before I grew up, that is), I have plenty of empathy and understanding for people that are in financial distress, but the bottom line is that it's more often than not of their own making.",Ireland,/r/europe/comments/behxu6/share_of_middleincome_households_having/el7orgz/,elcric_krej,1555617784

Not really, since you are still holding on to views that are totally against what the actual text says.

&gt;your dogging the quston by preposeing an alternative sanario that has almost nothing to with the original quston

No, I am not dodging anything. I am pointing out that your reasoning is flawed, since regulations are made a lot of times where the politicians themselves rely on experts and where goals are set for businesses to achieve to do better compared to what they do now.

That Content ID is currently the best example does not mean that once the directive goes into effect (which is at least a year or two away) the current state of it will still be the best that can be done. Technology moves quickly, but regarding this issue people seem to think it will stand still suddenly.

&gt;Witch in and of it's self is irreverent to the fact that company's are going to take the path of least residence/cost to implement filters

That is their choice.

&gt;Oh and BTW, 100 million might be pokit change for Google, but startups, but most smaller companys/sites 100% will not be able to afford that

Good thing then they are not expected to. Like I said, read the text. **Companies are not expected to implement measures they can not afford.** It is literally there in the text when it talks about when a company can be held liable.

&gt;So overall, do not reply UNLESS your willing to backup your beleaf that YouTube's ContentID system is a bad example by providing me with a better 1, 

Like I said before, most of the problems with Content ID is from Youtubers losing money in the time a video is claimed when it shouldn't be. Fix this (return the revenue stream once a false copyright claim is reverted) and they have nothing to complain about anymore. The system works pretty well.

There are many sensible people who made this same claim about many on the left. Are they all fascists? Steven pinker(the famous psychologist) made that claim for example, is he a fascist now?
Now you can of course disagree with xidada and Steven pinker and many others on that statement, but I think it’s quite Problematic to claim that anyone, that disagrees with you on that matter is a fascist. And Not only someone, who may have some fascist leanings and thought patterns, but a full blown fascist(and therefore dangerous?). I think this is a prime example of political polarization.

Overall not everything is left or right, or good or evil. This alarmist and moralistic rhetoric doesn’t benefit anybody really. I’ve once read an interesting article on contemporary nazification. And by that it meant how the left smears almost anyone as a nazi. And of course if you do that, you stifle political debate(because how can you debate nazis?). You can demand censorship and deplatforming (because why should hate speech be given a platform?).

There are no other connections. Based on that single arrow and some funding you cited, an overreaching conclusion is reached: the entire system of French organizations is being pushed by ""Anglo-Saxons"". 

OP, this is a bad conclusion and you should feel bad.

*""In fact, the first reflections of the Observatory of Food Innovations lead to the finding of a major offensive by major foreign manufacturers on the French meat market. Specialized in vegetable proteins, insect-based substitutes, or cell meat obtained by the in vitro development of stem cells, these actors lead a cognitive and informational fight aimed at changing French attitudes and diverting them from consumption patterns.""*

*""From the funding of anti-media, ultra-media NGOs to aggressive lobbying strategies on European standards, such as the Zootechnical Directive, these companies often linked to Anglo-Saxon investment funds or billionaires seem to have made the penetration of French market a priority by partnering with mass retailers. The Observatory of Food Innovation will attempt to decipher this strategy of encirclement, but also its consequences for the French economy.""*

603,"Well, arguably it is more acceptable, because it wan't colonialism

'Colonialism' as a concept wasn't really what happened in pre-Celtic Ireland as it didn't exist yet. There was no concept of nation state or mercantlism, no sense of a people taking ownership of another in the name of their state. These people weren't 'colonised' or 'exterminated' in any real sense. Like with the Normans, Angles, Saxons (or even the Romans to an extent) etc who moved into Britain, they absorbed and integrated with local population through marriage, migration and integration.


The Ulster Plantation was a deliberate project undertaken by the British State to supersede the Catholic population with a Protestant one as a way to claim ownership over parts of Ireland. Colonisation required the *replacement* of one people by another, or at the very least the placement of the colonists as the dominant social group within the colony.

634,"&gt;So people vote for the Brexit party for their Brexit policy to the one institution that cannot give them Brexit, but vote for the Brexit party merely as a protest vote in the place where they can actually get the Brexit policy they want.

Yes, because it sends a message (a protest vote..) without the Brexit party actually being in a position to do anything. Their candidates could all be Llamas and it wouldn't matter, because the UK is leaving the EU so we won't have MEP's in a few months. No-one is expecting the Brexit party in the EP to do anything to take the UK out of the EU because, as you point out, it can't do that.

&gt;How about having a second referedum and sparing us all having to deal with this?

How does that help? The UK would vote leave and we'd be in the same position we are now. The solution isn't a public vote, it's MP's finding a compromise that works and taking the UK out of the EU.

663,"&gt;I firmly disagree with your suggestion that Scotland does not have a fiscal deficit but, even if that were the case, the important thing is that an independent Scotland would have to cut spending or it would have a significant budget deficit by default as a result of current budget spending trends.

Being active in the pro-independence community, and having spent lots of times discussing the economic implications of an independent Scotland, I'd absolutely agree that changes would be needed somewhere, most likely in the form of higher taxation (as I support the Nordic high-tax/high-spend model), along with moderate cuts over the medium term.

I'm not denying that change would be needed, but I do reject the arguments of 'instant poverty' etc.

&gt;The fact remains that any change in the relationship between Scotland and the rest of the UK as proposed by the SNP and independence supporters which would lead to a divergence between the two countries

Absolute.

&gt;and both hard and soft economic barriers would lead to diminished economic growth in Scotland and resulting job losses.

See, this is where we disagree. I don't see any evidence that independence would result in diminished growth, or less trade between the two countries.

You have to ask yourself this: what can Scotland do at present, as part of the UK, to increase it's growth? What powers can Scotland use that it has to improve things?

I would argue that it can't, and that is must rely on passive changes that are made at a UK level.

You also have to ask: if Scotland is a net exporter to the UK (which it is), why would demand for goods from it's only overland enighbour stop in the event that the UK has put up trade barriers with the EU? 

&gt;The prosperity of entire Scottish regions and sections of the economy would be sacrificed or at the very least gambled on the altar of the ideology of independence.

There is that misunderstanding of independence again. Do you think I want independence for its own sake? Do you think most of us do?

&gt;It doesn't appear to be a price that a majority of Scots are willing to pay, even in the face of new challenges like Brexit.

&gt;I think strong relations between EU and Turkey would make Turkey more democratic and more secular in the long run

False. You assume that EU wants to make Turkey a part of their union. But that's plain wrong. EU sees Turkey as its outdoor guarding. That's all. 

Neither EU nor Europeans want Turkey to be a part of EU. Because Turks are not Christian and even if we were the most secular, most open minded people in the world, they'd rather let religiously conservative places like Armenia join EU than Turkey.

And if EU wanted Turkey to be democratic, why was their media dead silent in Ergenekon trials?

And on secularism, EU really does not care about that.

&gt;In addition there are a lot of things to learn from EU in terms of abortion rights, gender equality, marriage equality, other minority rights whether it’s ethnic based or gender based etc., enviromental awareness, cheerishing diversity, freedom of press and expression and so on.

(2) Greece did not have its own currency, and was left to their own devices by the ECB until they changed their fiscal policy. So the ECB refused to help them unless they changed their politics.

860,"&gt; Except le Duc, for all his faults did go through the effort of making a spire that you know....actually did fit the rest of the building. He could have easily gone with a neoclassical addition, which was more popular in France at the time, but he went instead with a neogothic spire. 

""Neo""styles were contemporary to his time, including neogothics.

&gt;But I don't think repeating le Duc's mistakes would be a good direction to move in. We should move away from a fantastical, fanciful reconstruction towards something that's more faithful to the original building I feel.

Originally, the place was trees and puddles, then probably wood and mud huts, then a a wood and mud hall... Why stick to an arbitrary point in time? The gothic builders had a certain vision - a lot of air and light and vertical building, and they certainly would have used steel and glass construction if they had access to it.

&gt;You find le Duc's spire, the Westminister Palace and the Hungarian parliament to be tacky? Interesting take.

Absolutely. It's almost Disney level of tacky, though of course that's a tacky version of neostyles, so Disney is *distilled* tackiness.

&gt;I mean many of Paris' iconic gothic buildings are to some extent neogothic, the Sainte Chapelle for example was heavily restored, but is today admired. Adding a clash of styles to such a prominent part of the cathedral would be absolutely terrible, it would be like giving Michelangelo's David pants.

Pants would cover up the David, and degrade the experience. But if a limb were to be destroyed, for example, then making a new one in a different colour would be *more* faithful to the original, because you're not pretending that your recent fake replica is real. 

New additions don't need to degrade the original, they can also enhance it.  For example, reconstructing the volume of the roof but in glass and steel (just an off the cuff idea) would respect the original plans, and respect the gothic ideals by using modern techniques to implement light and verticality. Let us consider all options, and not arbitrarily limit the searching space.

2) Because the products were never available in their region with the superior western quality meaning their only basis for expecting western quality is experience abroad which is limited for the average consumer.

A long term plan requires stability which a poor person doesn't have. The multiple safety nets that rich people have allows them to plan long term without paying too much attention to risks.

916,"&gt;culturally speaking, Czechs prefer to buy their homes instead of living in rented premises.

But that culture developed directly as a result of the privatization. Previously such a culture could not exist, and pre-1948, Czechia and Prague's housing situation was identical to other German cities, where most people lived as renters, and most buildings built were either by companies that offered their employees apartments (also to attract talent from the countryside this way) or land owners who built apartment buildings, kept the best unit for themselves and rented the rest.

The 90s privatization of housing was incredibly important for the Czech market economy, ecause by allowing the entire population easy access to owning their house, they also jump started the available capital to grow the early market economy. (this is also why Czechia's privatization was much more successful than for instance Hungary or Russia's, since buildings were returned or privatized to individuals, rather than individual apartment units like in Hungary, which too years to legally sort out, buy out, and put on the market.) This of course meant that people also sold their properties for luxury goods that they previously could not get, like color televisions or automobiles. These people then lost out as the apartments that they immediately sold for cheap accrues value while, they were left with depreciating assets and no further capital.

The construction industry today is still heavily oriented on what typical Czechs can afford, which is why there is such and explosion of villas being constructed in the Central Bohemian Region, because their size is set to under 120 sqm (so only 15% DPH rather than 22%) and the prices, of 5-6M closely mirrored the sum of the easily available loans for young Czech couples (as they could relatively easily save up the necessary 10% down payment of within the year). This was reinforced by the almost 0% interest loans that were in place since 2013 (IIRC).

The issue with housing int he center is that it is exactly not oriented to the Czech market, but rather foreign investors (especially RUssia and China now) and executives of Western companies that are headquartered here. Many of the insanely priced apartments (like 40k for a 3+1 in Karlin) are explciitly by foreign owner seeking other foreigners. This is only partially counteracted by existing Czech landlords, who lack the language skills to rent to foreigners and prefer to positively discriminate for other Czechs (though if they have pets or children is a another issue).

&gt;I mean those who own several flats and make a living by renting them out. 

That's because housing is no longer about just shelter but mainly about investment. And it has been this way since the end of the 2nd World War and the institution of government assistance for people (since just like after WW1 governments were appalled by the conditions their soldiers lived in, which decreased the fighting potential of their militaries). This cheap and easy source of money made the industry much more lucrative than it had been before, and the reorganization of the concept of a house as an asset means that people are also hostile to any measures that would decrease or decrease the increase it its value growth (hence NIMBYs and hostility to new developments today, since they would depress the shocking rise in housing prices.) At least those landlords rent out the properties, It is increasingly common for these owners to leave these units empty, since that way they would not need to invest more money after purchase (since you need to repair and reconstruct after renters leave).",Also maybe Czechoslovakia,/r/europe/comments/beecp8/countries_ranked_by_home_ownership_rate/el6avc0/,mastovacek,1555580742

It was generally seen as the weakest part of his restoration.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Building a new, more modern spire would not only repeat le Duc's mistake, but make it worse. The spire was relatively recent, so I do think there is a case to be made that it doesn't have to be an exact replica of le Duc's spire, but this still has me worried.

That should just demonstrate that the people who now want a replica of Viollet le Duc's spire would have opposed it if they lived in that time for being ""too modern"".

While there are some exceptions generally there so many protections for the leaseholder that there’s effectively little difference. It’s there as an archaic legal function.  The freehold fee is usually ‘peppercorn rent’ that amounts to &lt;£100 a year. (Almost all I know are significantly lower) and leaseholders have the automatic right to extend the leasehold. 

There is typically little to no interaction with the freeholder unless there’s new building works.

1058,"&gt; Not so much because the 300bn couldn't be coughed up, but it would open legal precedent for Poland and Russia and then, it's game over for the German economy.

That's why I think a better solution would be to finance a (very) substantial fund instead. Not as reparations, and not to the benefit of a specific country, but to acknowledge the crimes committed. This fund should then be used to finance student- and cultural exchanges, scholarships for international programs, and so on. 

My reasoning for this is that there neither is a way to properly assess the actual damage in financial terms, and if there was, it would be so enormous that there'd be no way Germany could afford to pay it anyway. There are only few of the direct victims still alive, fewer still of those who were personally responsible, and the most horrendous of the crimes can't be properly expressed in financial terms.

It would also open a terrible can of worms. Take Poland, for example. Even if you could come up with a financial amount, I can already see a certain German far-right populist party campaigning on the demand that every descendant of the former population of what is now the western part of Poland should receive compensation, or by making the question of the morality of some of the strategic bombings a topic, and I'd rather not see this happening. Any attempt to categorize actions taken in a war into one that were and ones that weren't acceptable, put a price on them, and tally them up against each other could only ever end badly.  
It would lead to the question of how far back you could go, and whether to include colonization, slavery and so on. Just in Europe, how would this affect the politics between the former Yugoslav countries, for example?

The crimes Germany committed under the Nazis were exceptional, and it's important that Germany recognizes this moral responsibility. But no country will admit to any crimes committed in its name ever again if it could mean it would have to accept a financial debt in the future. Neighbors will never be able to leave crimes their ancestors committed against each other behind them if they have to agree on a price before they can move on.

That's why starting such a fund that countries could pay into as well, voluntarily, would be a much better solution, IMHO. It's not possible to undo the past, but accepting responsibility for it is important, and making it possible especially for young people to experience other cultures would actually be helpful.",European Federation | Germany,/r/europe/comments/bec5du/greek_parliament_to_discuss_and_vote_on_war/el66k03/,CountVonTroll,1555573944

&gt; **Brexit Party** now first place in EU parliament voting intentions among Britons

Parent comment:

&gt; What the frack is wrong with these britons.

Implicitly asking why Brits would back the Brexit party somewhat en masse (27% only a few weeks after launch is impressive). 

Following comment:

&gt; turns out if you ignore the electorate they react

1102,"Swedish colours are pretty and the design is simple but it works. If you look at the German flag for example, it's very ugly colour mixed with the boring rectangles. I hate the German colours more than any flag in the world actually. 

&amp;#x200B;

Russian flag.. at least it's not the German flag, I don't hate the colours. I do think Russia could do better though. 

American flag.. meh, not the biggest fan. They have very nice state flags and the US Virgin Islands is the best overall official US territorial flag (California's is very nice too) with a gold eagle on a white background, very imperial looking but the stars and stripes.. it feels business like for some reason. The US Seal on the otherhand.. I have a tshirt of it, I love it. Not all versions though, some are too Space Force looking, others are too old.

The British flag is up there with Nepal in regard to best current national flags worldwide. It's truly brilliant. You can't even flip it upside down in protest nor can you burn them thanks to EU regulations on making flags fire retardant. All of those bars of colour actually make up centuries of history through immense struggle that still exist to this day. It's one of the most recognised flags in the whole world, certainly the most worn. I also love that the British people love their flag, I think it's an important national identity which is why it's a shame some countries flags are so incredibly dull with ugly colours but I wont get into that.

Italy also ceded the [Dodecanese Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodecanese) (2,714 km2) to Greece. How much is the value of the island of Rhodes alone (even if counting only the land directly owned by the state)? In contrast, how much did Germany pay?

1157,"&gt;I was referring to the point of time when Germany (and the other countries that gave loans to Greece) will have to cancel the debt, because everybody knows that the current level of Greek debt is not sustainable.

And as I already said even though they always knew that the debt was unsustainable they kept pretending that it wasn't, they kept refusing to do the haircut and they were forcing more loans down our throats.So what if after some years they'll eventually do the haircut (they will never cancel the debt by the way, I'm not sure what gave you that impression)? They already destroyed the economy and Germany earned a lot directly and indirectly because of the crisis. So I don't understand why you're presenting it as if germany will lose money and greece will somehow be the winner

&gt; I am not one of these.  

I never said that you were 

&gt; first I pointed out that there is an ethical problem with making great-great-grandchildren pay for the wrong-doings of their ancestors.  

And as I already pointed out that's what always happens. Any state is responsible for any wrong-doings and crimes it comitted in the past and it has the responsibility to pay the price for them. The state honours agreements, reparations, treaties, loans that took place in the past and it will continue honouring them in the future. The responsibilities of a state don't just disappear with the death of each generation so I don't understand why you're pretending that that's something shocking and not something that is happening all the time. If you consider something like this ethically problematic then you disagree with the way that each and every state in this world is operating.

&gt;  And second I pointed out that your argument about victims that are still alive is not sound.  

And your argument that the victims will eventually die is sound?

&gt; And what with other countries that may come with claims? 

I won't disagree with you on this. If Greece will go through with this, other countries will follow. That's why germany will do everything to avoid it.",Greece,/r/europe/comments/bec5du/greek_parliament_to_discuss_and_vote_on_war/el61zfq/,noimira57,1555567588

1208,"Dude what are you even talking about? This has nothing to do with you, me, the younger redditors or collective punishment. This has to do with the respronsibilities of a state towards another one. And the responsibilities of a state have nothing to do with the fact that your great-great-grandparents aren't alive. That's the reason that your country was still paying the WW1 reparations until a while ago. It didn't stop paying them just because the people that lived during that period aren't alive anymore. Reparations, treaties, agreements, loans, responsibilities are legally biding even if the people that were involved aren't alive anymore. If a country can claim something by law it will claim it. And in Greece's case, apart from the victims we're talking about a forced loan and destruction of infracture 

&gt; As a result of the [Nazi German occupation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_occupation_of_Greece), much of Greece was subjected to enormous destruction of its industry (80% of which was destroyed), infrastructure (28% destroyed), ports, roads, railways and bridges (90%), forests and other natural resources (25%)[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II_reparations#cite_note-13)[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II_reparations#cite_note-14)[\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II_reparations#cite_note-15) and loss of civilian life [(7.02–11.17% of its citizens)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II_casualties).[\[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II_reparations#cite_note-16)[\[17\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II_reparations#cite_note-17) The occupying Nazi regime forced Greece to pay the cost of the Nazi occupation in the country and requisite raw materials and food for the occupation forces, creating the conditions for the [Great Famine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Famine_(Greece)). Furthermore, in 1942, the Greek Central Bank was forced by the occupying Nazi regime to loan 476 million [Reichsmarks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichsmarks) at 0% interest to Nazi Germany. 

What's important here is:1)Will Tsipras move forward with it and 2) How many chances does Greece has to win. I don't understand why each time the matter of reperations is being brought up (no matter the country: Greece, Poland etc) there are only comments from people that are making lame jokes about the Romans (or something equivalent) and there is not even one informative comment with actual arguments . 

&gt; Third, I am sure Greece will get quite a lot of money from Germany (beyond the EU contributions, which already go to Greece above a pro-rata basis) 

Greece doesn't ""get"" money, it gets loans. Loans aren't free money if that's what you're implying

&gt;when at some point in the future Greek state debt will have to be cancelled due to being unsustainable. 

That happened with your country and my country was one of the countries that agreed to it. Your country didn't do the same, on the contrary it refused the haircut and forced through our throats more loans. So let's not even go there

&amp;#x200B;

 

Poland’s ruling conservative party Law and Justice (PiS) has said that the **country has no immediate intention of joining the eurozone and has invited other political parties to sign a joint declaration, which contains an assurance that Poland will adopt the euro only when it reaches the economic level of western countries.**

“I hope that this declaration will show the maturity of the Polish political class. It’s about the obvious interest of our country,” said PiS leader Jarosław Kaczyński. “We hope that the possible obligations of some political formations towards external allies will not matter, because the interest of the Polish society and the state is obvious here.”

Law and Justice had already discussed the topic of euro adoption during its convention last weekend.

“We say no to the euro, we say no to European prices,” the PiS leader said on April 13. “The EU membership treaty doesn’t specify the date of euro adoption. **Someday we will join, but only when our level of wealth comes close to that of Germany.”**

Mateusz Morawiecki, Poland’s prime minister, who when head of Polish bank BZ WBK advocated adopting the euro, also appears to have gone cold on the idea.

“It is worth asking whether joining the eurozone is in the interest of Poland,” he said. **“Greece had an economy 10 times smaller than the Germans in 2007. Today it is 18 times smaller.”**

Ryszard Petru, leader of the Now Party (Teraz), mocked the prime minister’s change of heart, sharing a video on Twitter of a debate from 2013. “When \[Mr Morawiecki\] still had thoughts of his own, he had different ideas about the euro and spoke rationally.”

Mr Morawiecki however defended his change in stance. “The opposition want to join the euro area as soon as possible. For us it has nothing to do with how good the EU is as a whole, but because we are one of the fastest growing EU countries. In 2018 GDP growth in the euro area was 1.8 per cent, and in Poland it was 5.1 per cent – almost three times faster,” said the prime minister.",Poland,/r/europe/comments/beh9my/poland_rules_out_euro_adoption/el5vv3i/,Tartyron,1555560781

1249,"&gt; That’s what the owner of the restoration company said.

While I appreciate the article, I'm confused as to why you've shared it.  Your original post says: ""... they are saying it is an accident to prevent outrage"".  If you're providing this as evidence to support your claim, then you *do* believe at least some of the official statements made about the fire.  Which begs the question why you believe *this* statement and not the others?

&gt; Which is why it is impossible to know how it started unless you are right there where it started.

There are a large number of places the fire *could* have started, which can be eliminated using the video and photographic evidence we have available to us.  We are left with the relatively small area of the rafters, roof, and spire as the most probable location for the start of the fire, all of which were undergoing renovation and were not accessible by the public.

&gt; Then why do they kill so few people? There are plenty of targets they could use for mass casualties, and plenty of methods, like poisoning the water supply, but they go for bombings instead.

Because they suck at killing people?  Fucked if I know, man, but the fact that they don't succeed at a threshold *you feel is appropriate* doesn't negate the pretty obvious pattern their attacks demonstrate.

&gt; And they always pick symbols of the West to strike, whether it is a church, a concert, whatever. Of course they’d always like to kill people, but the symbolism is more important.

They also have targeted marketplaces, airports, buses, trains, schools and airports.  Not exactly towering symbols of the West, since most countries have the same kinds of locations.

&gt; I didn’t know anyone who died in the building, nor did I see anyone killed in the attack. I did see the plane fly into the building though, and I did see it collapse. An actual strike in our own country. Picking New York and those buildings was the intention, not maximum casualties.

In all the attacks that link included, there was no attack that eschewed casualties in favor of the destruction of a symbolic location.  Throughout the history of modern terror attacks, a rather obvious pattern emerges that indicates a dedicated interest on inflicting casualties if at all possible, which is why we don't see many attacks on, say Mount Rushmore or the Statue of Liberty.

&gt; [Stuff about 9/11]

Again, not arguing that optics aren't a factor of terrorist attacks - I've said that two or three times now.

Dude, what are *you* talking about? No one here denies that Nazis committed horrible crimes in Greece. But this does not invalidate the ethical question that arises here: Should someone pay for the wrong-doings of their great-great-grandparents?

&gt; Greece doesn't ""get"" money, it gets loans. Loans aren't free money if that's what you're implying

No I wasn't. If you had read my sentence carefully, you would have noticed that I was referring to the point of time when Germany (and the other countries that gave loans to Greece) will have to cancel the debt, because everybody knows that the current level of Greek debt is not sustainable.

&gt; there are only comments from people that are making lame jokes about the Romans (or something equivalent) and there is not even one informative comment with actual arguments

I am not one of these. I gave you two arguments: first I pointed out that it is an ethical problem to make great-great-grandchildren pay for the wrong-doings of their ancesters. And second I pointed out that your argument about victims that are still alive is not sound. And here is a third argument: If Germany starts with paying Greece, other countries will ask for money, too, and it will simply not be feasible to pay off all the shit committed by the Nazis. It is already not possible for Germany to pay the 300 billion that Greece asks for. I would roughly estimate 10 billion per year would be possible, but thats it.

&gt;	You've obviously never fought a fire, - they can grow out of control very quickly.

Which is why it is impossible to know how it started unless you are right there where it started.

&gt;	The kind of symbolic attack you're talking about is a great plot for a movie, but I struggle to find examples of them in the real world. 

Then why do they kill so few people? There are plenty of targets they could use for mass casualties, and plenty of methods, like poisoning the water supply, but they go for bombings instead.

And they always pick symbols of the West to strike, whether it is a church, a concert, whatever. Of course they’d always like to kill people, but the symbolism is more important.

&gt;	but the loss of life inflicted far more damage than a building being destroyed

I didn’t know anyone who died in the building, nor did I see anyone killed in the attack. I did see the plane fly into the building though, and I did see it collapse. An actual strike in our own country. Picking New York and those buildings was the intention, not maximum casualties.

I guarantee you that seeing the damage they did had more of an effect than the loss of life, because it showed that any place was a potential target. It was surreal at the time.

I remember being in class in school and people were panicked, thinking that a strike in our area would happen next. I thought it was silly given where I lived, but understandable for people under so much stress.

Also one of their planes was going for the pentagon. The heart of the American financial industry, and the heart of the American military. It’s all symbolism to these people.

The public opinion is carefully managed, so that everyone who thinks differently also thinks they are alone, preventing organisation.

The Internet has been a great democratization of publishing. Anyone can post anything and then anyone can read it or watch it, and discuss it in the comments. The gatekeeping is gone and the traditional powers have pretty much no control over it. All of the political changes in the last decade have been due to this. Whole parties have been founded. The ""managed democracy"" is coming to an end. With the Internet, *anyone* can find some like-minded people and band together to demand a say.

Germans have a huge hatred towards the Americans for occupying them (even to the point of Der Spiegel making up false news stories about Americans).

Systemic banking institutions have to offer free banking services to everyone due to competition from newer and much more efficient banks, or risk losing deposits. But with them, the consumer's deposits are instead funneled to the payroll of individuals that not only produce nothing, but for most of their paid time, also sit to due nothing due to advancement in technologies and increased usage of automated solutions. Through this, the entire economy is affected because literally any other use of this money could benefit the general population much more. It's not a cost measurable in numbers directly, but the opportunity cost is large nevertheless.

1729,"&gt; Newspaper uncovers $172 billion in government assistance to the German auto industry

&gt; Ever wondered how the German car industry maintains its technical lead over the rest of the world? Wonder no more.

&gt; A German newspaper has uncovered €115 billion ($A172.5b) in federal government assistance to the country’s car industry over the last decade.

&gt; Handelsblatt found the German car industry, long suspected of having an overly-cozy relationship with the Merkel-lead government, had vacuumed up and average of €11.5 billion ($A17.2b) a year in assistance, subsidies and just plain handouts since 2007.

&gt; In comparison, the Australian government earmarked $2.5 billion in direct assistance to the local auto industry (from which Holden and Toyota will join Ford in departing as a manufacturer by the end of this year) as part of its 10-year Automotive Transformation Scheme, which runs from 2011 to 2020.

&gt; The data, dug up by Handelsblatt, was part of a government reply to a Left Party question and showed the car-makers being helped with tax benefits, the disposal of old cars and €1 billion in direct research and development help.

&gt; Daimler was the biggest beneficiary of the R&amp;D aid, soaking up €191 million in the last decade, while the Volkswagen Group took €110 million and Daimler’s premium rival, BMW, was given €107 million.

&gt; Further down the list was MAN (€16 million), Opel (€14 million), Ford (€13 million) and Audi (€9 million).

&gt; The Berlin-based German government has also spent about €800 million on 25,000 vehicles over the past decade, mostly designed and built in Germany.

&gt; Volkswagen delivered 15,499 vehicles to the German government, Daimler pumped in 3107, Opel (now under French management) sold 3044, Ford chipped in with 1562 and BMW sold 1226.

&gt; One of the Left Party’s law-makers, Herbert Behrens, insisted the funding wasn’t always spent in the right ways and didn’t always have the desired results, blaming it for Dieselgate and for holding back electric cars.

&gt; “Billions in tax money have been put in dead-end technological developments which resulted in the emissions scandal,” Behrens said.

&gt; “The government is serving the short-term interests of the auto industry,” he said, adding it was “obstructing the changeover” to electric cars.

&gt; The Merkel government has set a domestic sales goal of a million electrified (battery electric and plug-in hybrid) cars a year by 2020, which Merkel now admits it won’t reach. Only 80,000 electrified cars were sold in Germany last year.

&gt; Instead, Chinese car-makers have taken the lead on sales of electric vehicles, while California’s Tesla has demonstrated a market for the technology at the premium end of the market, albeit at consistent losses.

&gt; The German government also has targets to cut emissions by 40 per cent by 2030 and to slash it to zero by 2050.

&gt; The car industry directly employs 800,000 people in Germany, many of whom have been hit by the sudden decline in diesel sales in the country, where volumes have fallen 8.1 per cent since the beginning of this year, leading to Bavaria’s governor Horst Seehofer calling for a subsidy on diesel cars to lift sales.

&gt; Oddly enough, a diesel subsidy would most benefit BMW, which is based in Bavaria’s capital city, Munich, because it has the highest proportion of diesel sales out of all Europe’s main players, at 71 per cent. The next richest diesel model mix is at Daimler, at 64 per cent.

&gt; The flipside to that is a proposal by Stuttgart, the capital of the neighbouring state, to ban diesels from city streets on bad pollution days starting next year. Stuttgart is home to both Daimler and Porsche.",,/r/europe/comments/beas32/secret_german_auto_subsidies_exposed/el4aqa4/,Soupjoe5,1555523383

1731,"Istanbul's annual income -with its subcompanies- is more than 10 billion dollars. AKP was using this money to feed their people, create their own bourgeois. On the paper, more than 200 million dollar of money goes to the foundations his son supports, and foundations to educate religion to young people to form a new kind of Turkey.

Yes, they are trying to remove secularism for a long time, they are figthing for it. And they were trying to raise a new generation by using the Istanbul's and Ankara's (I think its annual income is more than 2 billion usd) municipial income. Now they lost both of them and they don't know what to do.

When people get used to take money from you to support you, it's hard to convince them to keep supporting you without giving any money. Now, they don't have any money to give. Economical situtation is already bad in the country. They won't be able to feed those foundations anymore. And let's see how much they can stay alive without government support and help.

I hope this will be a new era for Turkey. Unfortunately Ankara doesn't get enough recognition here but Ankara's new mayor Mansur Yavas is already fighting against AKP (they are the majority there) in the municipial council valiantly. Because the council is keep trying to cripple him, he decided to open the council meetings to the people. So everyone can see what's going on inside.

Turkish scientist around the world who left the country because of Erdogan regime already congratulates Imamoglu and Yavas and say they are ready to do everything they can to help about anything related to science. It's clear that they want to return their country and continue do to their job if opposition can win the presidentship in 2023.

&gt; Handelsblatt found the German car industry, long suspected of having an overly-cozy relationship with the Merkel-lead government, had vacuumed up and average of €11.5 billion ($A17.2b) a year in assistance, subsidies and just plain handouts since 2007.

&gt; In comparison, the Australian government earmarked $2.5 billion in direct assistance to the local auto industry (from which Holden and Toyota will join Ford in departing as a manufacturer by the end of this year) as part of its 10-year Automotive Transformation Scheme, which runs from 2011 to 2020.

&gt; The data, dug up by Handelsblatt, was part of a government reply to a Left Party question and showed the car-makers being helped with tax benefits, the disposal of old cars and €1 billion in direct research and development help.

&gt; Daimler was the biggest beneficiary of the R&amp;D aid, soaking up €191 million in the last decade, while the Volkswagen Group took €110 million and Daimler’s premium rival, BMW, was given €107 million.

&gt; Further down the list was MAN (€16 million), Opel (€14 million), Ford (€13 million) and Audi (€9 million).

&gt; The Berlin-based German government has also spent about €800 million on 25,000 vehicles over the past decade, mostly designed and built in Germany.

&gt; Volkswagen delivered 15,499 vehicles to the German government, Daimler pumped in 3107, Opel (now under French management) sold 3044, Ford chipped in with 1562 and BMW sold 1226.

&gt; One of the Left Party’s law-makers, Herbert Behrens, insisted the funding wasn’t always spent in the right ways and didn’t always have the desired results, blaming it for Dieselgate and for holding back electric cars.

&gt; “Billions in tax money have been put in dead-end technological developments which resulted in the emissions scandal,” Behrens said.

&gt; “The government is serving the short-term interests of the auto industry,” he said, adding it was “obstructing the changeover” to electric cars.

&gt; The Merkel government has set a domestic sales goal of a million electrified (battery electric and plug-in hybrid) cars a year by 2020, which Merkel now admits it won’t reach. Only 80,000 electrified cars were sold in Germany last year.

&gt; Instead, Chinese car-makers have taken the lead on sales of electric vehicles, while California’s Tesla has demonstrated a market for the technology at the premium end of the market, albeit at consistent losses.

&gt; The German government also has targets to cut emissions by 40 per cent by 2030 and to slash it to zero by 2050.

&gt; The car industry directly employs 800,000 people in Germany, many of whom have been hit by the sudden decline in diesel sales in the country, where volumes have fallen 8.1 per cent since the beginning of this year, leading to Bavaria’s governor Horst Seehofer calling for a subsidy on diesel cars to lift sales.

&gt; Oddly enough, a diesel subsidy would most benefit BMW, which is based in Bavaria’s capital city, Munich, because it has the highest proportion of diesel sales out of all Europe’s main players, at 71 per cent. The next richest diesel model mix is at Daimler, at 64 per cent.

&gt; The flipside to that is a proposal by Stuttgart, the capital of the neighbouring state, to ban diesels from city streets on bad pollution days starting next year. Stuttgart is home to both Daimler and Porsche.",,/r/europe/comments/beat6u/secret_german_auto_subsidies_exposed/el4auwy/,Soupjoe5,1555523467

I am no expert, but I am pretty sure the parallel archs you see in the stone vault are the prolonging of the arc-boutants which allow the cathedral to stand. One of them got destroyed by the falling spire.

On top of it, it was the only structure in the cathedral that stood on wood and not on stone (apart from the roof, which was the whole reason of using wood in the first place). Maybe a bit picky argument, but that doesn't look like a good design.

So you can but I can't?

&gt; the Nazis took Czechoslovakia, Austria and Memel. they planned to take Poland, baltics, Caucasus and the soviet union for Lebensraum. this was clearly laid out in their ideology. 

I'll give you a hint. Not all of those things actually happened. Just because it was planned it doesnt trump soviet atrocities that ACTUALLY HAPPENED. Can you differentiate between fact and fiction? Because ""what if"" scenarios are fiction. No matter how likely. If they didn't happen - they didn't happen.

&gt; the allies and Soviets stood in their way

Ah yes. The Soviets stood in their way. I'm sure there was some choreographing to do during the parade. 

&gt; but the allies sat on their asses until Poland while the Soviets had a shitty army. cornered and without allies, the Soviets had to buy time. meanwhile, Germany's next target was Poland but this time the allies were gonna intervene. not willing to fight a two front war, Hitler decided to focus on the Allies first and take out the Soviets at a later date. hence Molotov-Ribbentrop was signed to buy time for both sides. for the Soviets, it was a matter of survival, for Hitler it was a matter of continuing their conquests.

 stating that Stalin wanted an early alliance with the Allies (that failed to be realised because of appeasement) is a historical fact.

the Soviets being diplomatically isolated is a fact.

eventual invasion of the Soviet Union was going to happen. that's a fact.

Molotov-Ribbentrop was a result of circumstances. it didn't have to happen if the allies allied the Soviets to take out the Nazis early on. if Molotov-Ribbentrop wasn't signed, Hitler would've taken all of Poland, which means shorter distance to the soviet core and a larger front to attack from. this was bad strategic position for the Soviets.

it's kinda important to understand the historical context which explains why nations did things in the way they happened.

also nice cognitive dissonance regarding Poland. when Poland does it, it's justified and ""opportunistic"" but not when the Soviets do it. also size of land taken is kinda irrelevant.

1909,"The Germans did learn from that.  They signed a non-aggression pact with Moscow, clobbered stuff to the west, *then* violated the hell out of the non-aggression pact and went after the Soviets.

Hitler's missing lesson wasn't ""don't fight on two fronts"", but ""put two rounds through your enemy's head before you call him dead"".  He decided that his west was effectively neutralized once the British retreated across the Channel and that he could move against the Soviet Union.

Also, Germany tried to avoid two fronts in WW1 — one of their major strategic aims was avoiding letting a two-front situation develop.  The [Schlieffen Plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schlieffen_Plan) aimed to use a smaller amount of force to hold off Russia, while attacking into France, quickly knocking her out, and then moving everything against Russia.

https://www.open.edu/openlearn/history-the-arts/history/world-history/the-schlieffen-plan

&gt; Schlieffen decided to concentrate all German effort on the right wing of the German army, even if the French decided on offensive action along another part of the long common border and even at the risk of allowing the French temporarily to reclaim Alsace-Lorraine.
&gt;
&gt;In his planning, Schlieffen counted on two things: that German victory in the West would be quick (he estimated this to take about 6 weeks), and that Russian mobilisation would be slow, so that a small German defensive force would suffice to hold back Russia (considered to be a ‘clay-footed colossus’) until France was beaten.
&gt;
&gt;After a swift victory in the West, the full force of the German army would be directed eastwards. Russia would be beaten in turn. This was the recipe for victory, the certain way out of Germany’s encirclement.

In practice, the plan effectively went into reverse.  The French were able to halt the Germans, and the poorly-coordinated Russian forces initially moving against the Germans were split up and defeated.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/bdt1r6/on_this_day_vladimir_lenin_arrives_at_the_finland/el3n2ko/,vokegaf,1555508887

Yet we do nothing and allow these destructive, demented, deranged and dangerous people to unleash their malfunctioning brain wiring and twisted views and wreck things time and time again, smh :/. Enough is enough tbh!. Its crazy when you think about it)..


But i digress: The truth is that this ultimately isnt about porn, porn is merely a smokescreen, an opening into setting up the Great Firewall of the UK. That's the end goal for May, Tories, Labour and political establishment. Its about censorship, it starts with porn(they know many Brits if not most can often be very squimish, prudish, puritanical about these matters, Brits are waaaay too awkward about sexual stuff, sexually repressed on such a topic etc so nobody will come out publically and stand against it, cuz no doubt they'd face calls of them being a ""sex pervert"", ""perv"", ""ewww you watch porn how gross and sad, lol"".. even though most Brits watch and use porn to get off, humans are inherantly sexual beings, yet nobody would ever admit to it publically. That sexual repression allows MPs to do shit like this. Brits need to stop being so weird, puritanical &amp; awkward about sexual issues. There's nothing wrong about porn. There's nothing sad or weird about being a sexual being) then... Dark times ahead. These demented Tory &amp; Labour creeps in government have no right to tell any adult what they can and cant watch!.

The US Trade Representative (USTR) said the ruling in the dispute opens the way for placing tariffs on EU goods.
The USTR argued that European countries had given $22bn in state aid to Airbus to help launch its A380 and A350 jets, causing losses to US rival Boeing.
The European Commission said most of the disputed support ended in 2011.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_brown_bear


&gt; Most adult female grizzlies weigh 130–180 kg (290–400 lb), while adult males weigh on average 180–360 kg (400–790 lb). Average total length in this subspecies is 198 cm (6.50 ft), with an average shoulder height of 102 cm (3.35 ft) and hindfoot length of 28 cm (11 in).[16] Newborn bears may weigh less than 500 grams (1.1 lb). In the Yukon River area, mature female grizzlies can weigh as little as 100 kg (220 lb). One study found that the average weight for an inland male grizzly was around 272 kilograms (600 lb) and the average weight for a coastal male was around 408 kilograms (900 lb). For a female, these average weights would be 136 kilograms (300 lb) inland and 227 kilograms (500 lb) coastal, respectively.[17] On the other hand, an occasional huge male grizzly has been recorded which greatly exceeds ordinary size, with weights reported up to 680 kg (1,500 lb).[18] A large coastal male of this size may stand up to 3 metres (9.8 ft) tall on its hind legs and be up to 1.5 metres (4.9 ft) at the shoulder.[19]

They're as legitimately descended from Rome as anyone else. All the more so that under the **Empire** *Romans* weren't *Italians*. Notwithstanding that Republican « Italianess » was a political concept more than anything, restricted to a part of the peninsula.

Italy's just the first area Rome expended into. Past the related Italic tribes, it's really all the same.

&gt;metropole of the Roman Empire

As were Trier, Ravenna or Constantinople at times.

&gt;Also, Rome was the center of gravity of ''Western christianity''' in antiquity, middle ages and renaissance.

Complete nonsense. The centers of gravity, in terms of intellectual production and teaching, of Western Christendom during the Early Middle Ages were the great monasteries of the British Isles and the Frankish Empire. And Paris after the University was built. It's hard to express how much of a wreck Italy was after the Gothic invasion and the plague. There was complete societal collapse. The pope was *granted land in Italy* by Pepin the Short for God's sake. Religious reforms for the entire Church were passed by *Charlemagne*. And that kept going for a while. When the King of France or the German Emperor disliked a Pope... they just replaced him. Or invaded Italy, as is tradition. Rome was the Seat of Saint Peter, but for a very long time it wasn't the source of Catholic thought more than anywhere else. In the Middle Ages it was an outright dump, it's a good thing everything was cleaned up after the Counter-Reformation.

Utter nonsense. If you use the term ""Italians"" to refer to peoples conquered by Rome then you should say that Rome itself was Italian. Italy was not a conquered province but a federation with Italic cities associated to the leading Italic city (Rome). This was very clear to the Romans themselves. You can read the Origines by Cato, the Aeneid by Virgil, the Res Gesate Divi Augusti by Augustus Caesar, the Naturalis Historia by Pliny etc etc

Italy was not like every other part of the Empire. It was the ""Patria"". Gaul, Anatolia, Egypt etc were provinces.

Steel can have advantages but also incredible disadvantages.

In the case of Notre Dame, the wooden beams burned and their burned out husked fell on the vaulted ceiling, but weren't heavy enough to do catastrophic damage. With steel beams, they would've crushed the vault completely.

What you also need to take into account, is how much Gothic cathedrals push the boundaries of what is possible. The load distribution onto the outer walls is such an intricate balance in some cases, that any added weight, or the wrong direction of this weight distribution might buckle walls. 

On the other hand, a certain weight \*might\* be needed to push down on the walls

In short: He and his Aides created fake passports for Latin American countries (mostly of Paraguay) and bribed a Paraguayan consul to gain blank passes. Those fake passports were then smuggled via a network of Jewish organisations to Poland and the Netherlands to be distributed. Paraguay under pressure from Poland and the Holy See actually recognized those passports as valid for a time.

2171,"interesting. Many countries where violence is more tolerated are apparently less violent. i find it hard to believe people are really that different in different countries. I would also like to see this broken down on the types of violence in the survey to get a better picture. 

Alcoholism is the source of most more serious violence but that is actually mostly a problem of alcoholic couples. Most of the intimate partner violence (for both sexes) happens between couples where both are alcoholic and violent and cannot fix their problems. They fill the statistics with countless cases per couple each year. This doesn't explain how that large share of women have experienced violence.

A couple of hypotheses: 

1. More partners equals more likely to at some point encounter someone who is violent. This survey doesn't say how many women experience violence in their current relationships but how many have ever been in a relationship where there is violence. 
2. More traditional gender roles create less conflict. If both partners have clear role they are less likely to argue about things -&gt; less of the mild violence. (this also is why it would be nice to see minor pushing and life threatening stabbing differentiated)
3. If violence is more tolerated it might create an environment where the threat of violence reduces conflic. i.e. ""i'm going to hit you if you do that"" leads to no reason for violence in the end.",Finland,/r/europe/comments/bdsd06/violence_against_woman_in_the_lifetime/el398rg/,jaaval,1555495345

2184,"Basically, since the 2008 crash, a lot of ""superfluous"" expenses are reduced, ignored or regularly moved to future dates. This is common in all sectors, and even if the economy is good now, it became the norm. The problem is that before 2008, those sectors where already slowing down for multiple reasons : aging specialized peoples not replaced, reducing budgets for the sake of it, populism, sabotage, corruption, and the good old ""good enough"" mentality a lot of politics have here. A lot of maintenance and preservation is made by local voluntary groups, without budget or support.

Now, investing in history will became a very good PR point for the politics. Next year, a lot of Maires will be elected in France, it's the most local election, and history will soon be added to the elections programs. This will create a lot of demand for workers, and restart the restoration sector, or a least refreshing it.

And for a direct example of the downfall before 2008, i knew a stone cutter who worked on Notre Dame around 2005. Basically, they extract a damaged stone block from the wall by slightly push the surrounding blocks, and replace it by a new bloc. In a lot of cases, the new block was half the length of the original, because of the reduced price. Effectively creating a small empty space behind, and a very minor structural issue. They hated that, but had no choice (this is an insanely small sector, on the European size). They even had to keep some full size new blocks, in case of a control. That's how corruption was then, and it's worse now. Having lights on the sector will be a very good thing.

In a fun final word, those spaces are full of time capsules now. And it was the case since the beginning of the construction, and for all maintenance since. When a cache is found, they preserve it, add some new things (papers, wine bottle, arts and craft, small statues, etc), and replace all is a new cache.

2193,"Pros and cons, imo.

Very heavily oriented towards IT.

But if you're a chef or something like that, don't expect to live an above average life.

If you want to start a company, that's when the pros kick in. 

Takes about 150EUR to start a company and the start capital isn't required to pay in for years if you want.

In the IT community, i'd say about 25% of developers have their own company. Most handle it next to their day jobs, but as a developer you can start working as a company without having a day job as well. 

But still, tech is the job you'd want in estonia, most other jobs aren't better than anywhere else. The average IT salary is about twice the national average, which in terms of quality of life, is a huge pro.

A decent developer can afford a new apartment, good car and still have more than half of the salary left.

Sure you can compare the salaries to Norway or Denmark and say it's higher there, but don't forget about the cost of living.

2232,"&gt;Are you aware that the number is at least 20 years old and wasn't really calculated through evidence-based research?

That report was published in 2015. And according to a more recent [survey](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2018/12/11/49-percent-russian-women-say-they-are-most-risk-violence-at-home-poll-says-a63780), 49% of Russian women say they are most at risk of violence at home. 73% of Russians believe violence against women was a significant problem in Russia — with 79 percent of women and 65 percent of men agreeing with the statement.

Even your own human rights official [admits](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2018/12/03/decriminilization-domestic-violence-was-mistake-russian-official-admits-a63688) decriminalizing domestic violence was a mistake.

&gt; Are you aware that the number can't possibly make any sense considering the fact that there were ~8,000 homicides in Russia last year?

Here we go again. Homicide is something entirely different than death due to domestic abuse. For murder you need [intent](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate#/Definition).

&gt;Within the broad range of violent deaths, the core element of *intentional* homicide is the complete liability of the direct perpetrator, which thus excludes killings directly related to war or conflicts, self-inflicted death (suicide), killings due to legal interventions or justifiable killings (such as self-defence), **and those deaths caused when the perpetrator was reckless or negligent but did not intend to take a human life (non-intentional homicide)**. 

And that's what we're talking about here: non-intentional homicide. When you slap your woman senseless for years and she dies due to causes of being slapped around for years, that doesn't make it an intentional homicide. You didn't *intend* to actually kill her, but she died anyway.

&gt;
According to domesticviolence.ru, more than 16 million women a year are estimated to experience domestic violence in Russia, but only 10% of them go to the police.

&gt;Russian women suffering domestic violence are being deterred from going to the police since its partial decriminalisation last year, campaigners have claimed after a dramatic fall in reported incidents.
&gt;
The state statistics, released in July, reveal that the number of cases of domestic violence reported to the police in 2017 almost halved since physical abuse became punishable by a fine rather than time in prison.

And then there's this:

&gt;Violence against [women](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/russia-country-of-concern--2/russia-country-of-concern#womens-rights) remained a cause of concern. According to official figures, 12,000 women are killed annually in Russia as a result of domestic violence (one woman every 40 minutes). In the North Caucasus, women continued to face threats, including marriage by abduction and so-called honour killings.

He's not inventing shit.

Religion is incompatible with communism because in communism, God is the state. The state is all powerful, perfect and benevolent in your protection. You can't have a competing idea which transcends the state, hence religion had to be surpressed.

Another way to look at it is the ""divine right of kings"" idea so common in Western Europe, perhaps most famous in Britain - Dieu et mon droit - ""God is my right"". The king was transcended only by God, but the king was not a mere person. He was directly appointed and ordaned by God. Charlemagne is perhaps the best single example of this type of thing.

2405,"This is a ridiculously wrong apology for corruption.

&gt;The typical ""networking"" that everyone knows is crucial in business, that's actually corruption, except subtle favors are exchanged instead of cash.

Oh, bullshit. You have zero idea what ""networking"" is. There are no ""subtle favors"" exchanged. That's not networking at all. 

Networking is ""We need to hire a lawyer and I know that my friend John from law school is looking for a job like this, so I'm going to suggest that he apply and tell the hiring partner he's a good guy."" 

&gt; Like imagine you need a permit for something that is usually restricted for reasons, but in a poor country there is no way to give it or way to not give it because the permit doesn't exist so the only way is to bribe some official. Rich countries simply create those standards, methodologies and procedures so since it's official it doesn't count as corruption, but don't kid yourself, the same rich organizations pull the stings in both cases.

More bullshit. 

In your imaginary poor country, electrical work in commercial buildings, say, needs to be certified by an electrician. But because electricians are hard to find, or whatever, the company bribes someone for the certification.

In the rich country, they hire the electrician, who examines the work and issues the certificate.

Are you really unable to tell the difference between the two examples? In the *first* example, the electrical work was *never inspected*. 

In the second example, it *was inspected*. 

Result: lots of electrical fires in the poorer country *because of corruption*. Specifically, because it's much easier to bribe and get the permit than to actually have the safety inspection done. 

This is stupid false equivalency. If you want to claim that poorer countries resort to corruption because there's no other way of getting things done, do that. 

But it's beyond stupid to try to equate non-corrupt countries with corrupt countries on the basis that both require safety inspections - leaving aside the fact that they are actually conducted in the non-corrupt countries, and are not in the corrupt countries. 

In 1994, there was a massive earthquake near Los Angeles which killed 57 people. In 1999, there was a massive earthquake in Turkey which killed 18,000 people. 

One huge difference is that California's strict building codes for minimizing earthquake damage are strictly enforced; in Turkey, which has similar codes, investigations afterwards showed that more than half of the buildings did not meet the required standards. 

That's the real difference between corruption and lack of corruption. And functioning institutions and lack of functioning institutions. 

It's ridiculous to claim that both are equally corrupt because - to the extent I can follow your argument - in the first case, money goes into the pocket of the builders who build the earthquake resistant buildings, and in the second case, money goes into the pocket of the clerks who stamp the fake building permits. 

Paying more for earthquake resistant building *isn't corruption*. Paying for a fake paper stating that a building is earthquake resistant when it isn't *is* corruption.

2464,"&gt;Why would you believe it was a renovation accident?

Because the fire appears to have begun in the areas where renovations were being performed.  Construction work and renovation are filled with fire hazards, and even in a modern setting there's plenty of fuel ignition sources that could result in an accidental fire.  The area the fire appears to have started from was part of the building's ancient wooden frame, filled with dry wood.  Furthermore, given that only a single firefighter suffered injuries - that I am aware of - we can infer the workers who were present at the start of the fire survived and were able to give their own accounts as to the origins of the blaze.

&gt;You think a proper investigation has been done already?

I don't think a thorough investigation has been completed, no.  But given the information we have available, the idea this fire was intentional is a stretch.

&gt;It’s just as likely that it was set intentionally and they are saying it is an accident to prevent outrage. 

No, it is not ""just as likely"".  That is a *possibility*, but it is much less *probable* than an accidental fire due to the circumstances surrounding the fire.  Namely, the location where the fire is thought to have started and the fact that part of the building was undergoing renovation.

But let's play along with your idea, for a moment.  Let's assume this was a terrorist act... it'd be a colossal fuck-up on behalf of whoever was trying to inflict maximum terror.  In order for this to have been intentionally set, that means someone would have to have access to the wooden roof undergoing renovation.  The cathedral's main hall is open to the public, but the interior - where the offices of the archbishop and archdiocese are - are not open to the public.  They've got some pretty hefty security, from what I remember when I visited the cathedral.  And that was 20 years ago - it's almost certainly gotten better by now.

So that means they'd have to go through the company doing the renovations, which is a French construction &amp; restoration firm named ""Le Bras Freres"".  Being a World Heritage site in a prosperous, modern country, and given the previous terror attacks that Paris has suffered in the previous years, there had to have been some degree of security regarding who had access to the scaffolding and the wooden frame of the cathedral.  That's not even considering the fact that such work is incredibly dangerous; security would be present simply to prevent idiots wandering up the scaffolding to take a wicked selfie and plummeting to their deaths (which would open the company up to liability).

So, if this fire was intentional, they'd have to get through a bunch of layers of security.

Why was this a colossal fuck-up?  Because they wasted their one shot to kill a *fuckload* of people.  If this was supposed to be a *terrorist attack*, then why the fuck would they set the fire after the church had closed to the public, and just a few days *before* Easter Sunday?

Do you have any idea how many people attend Easter services at Notre Dame each year?  People are packed in cheek-to-jowl.  If the goal was inflicting terror, then waiting until Easter Sunday, when that cathedral would have been chock-full of innocent people, would've been far more effective than this.  The deaths from the fire would be high, of course, but even more would be trampled to death in the ensuing stampede to flee the burning building.  These theoretical terrorists of yours would be very disappointed in themselves - only one person sustained injuries throughout the entire ordeal.

I could go on, but I need to get to sleep.  Just... seriously, dude, the idea is simply not equally probable with an accidental fire.  And it's really fucked up the shit that's being said on the subreddits you frequent and have a lot of karma from.",,/r/europe/comments/bdil88/notre_dame_is_on_fire/el2wicf/,GearBrain,1555476940

2474,"You very much hit the nail on its head by connecting this discussion with the European identity. People look for something to hold on to while the pillars their identity is based on fell down, as if it were spires on the Notre Dame. I immediatly want to add that identity was never a completly clear and obvious thing, but it probably made a little more sense when religion was still popular and globalisation hadnt started yet.

That being said, you believe the solution to that is to rebuild the cathedral as quick and historically accurate as possible as to not irritate ‘the masses’, if I can put it a bit unrespectful, and the French government will likely agree with you. 
While in my opinion doing so is (ridiculously expensive and) irrational, you even mention that yourself. The fire happened, the building doesn’t have any ‘real’ function, and lets be honnest, nobody consciously cared about the notre dame that much. And yet, many people just want it to go back to the way it was. Because it’s safe, it’s known, it’s part of an identity they can understand, even if it is artificial. 
A contemporary interpretation, whatever that may be, might try to construct a French identity that doesn’t ignore the fact that the world has changed. Similar to how the cathedral evolved in the past. It got damaged or worn off, so they repaired it and tweeked the design a bit. And you can bet your ass the people at the time disagreed with it immensly. But yet, 100 years later, this is ‘the one true notre dame’.

Poland’s ruling party rolls out tax cut in elections bid

Latest in series of spending pledges comes as polls suggest a close race


Poland’s ruling Law and Justice party has unveiled details of a 10.4bn zloty tax cut as it battles to woo voters ahead of crucial European and national parliamentary elections this year.

Recent polls have suggested a close racebetween Law and Justice and a coalition of opposition parties in next month’s European elections, which both sides are hoping to use as a springboard for national elections in the autumn.

In a bid to shore up its position, Law and Justice has in recent weeks unveiled a series of higher spending pledges, including expanding its flagship child benefit programme and higher payouts for pensioners, as well as promising to cut taxes.


The giveaways have drawn warnings from rating agencies that Poland’s budget deficit — which has fallen amid a sustained economic boom and hit a multi-decade low of 0.5 per cent of national output last year — could come close to the EU’s 3 per cent limit in 2020.

The government also risks encouraging public sector workers to demand rises of their own, some economists have warned.

Teachers are currently entering the second week of a strike over pay, and there has been speculation that doctors, who went on strike last year over the level of public health expenditure, could do so again.

The most costly part of the tax overhaul is a rejig of Poland’s income tax bands. The country currently has a lower band of 18 per cent and a higher band of 32 per cent. Under the reform, a new lower band of 17 per cent will be added. The government expects the change to cost 5.3bn zloty.

It also plans to exempt people aged under 26 from income tax — which is forecast to cost 1.7bn zloty — and change the tax deductibles system, which is expected to cost 3.4bn zloty.

Teresa Czerwinska, Poland’s finance minister, told journalists that the reform was a progressive one and would benefit the poorest in society most, as well as helping to boost economic growth. The government has raised its forecast for this year from 3.8 per cent to 4 per cent.

However, economists criticised the changes as unnecessarily complex.

“Introducing a new tax rate to go from 17 from 18 per cent is a huge complication for a marginal benefit for the taxpayer. I’m surprised as it would have been much easier to increase the tax-free quota to get a similar result,” said Witold Orlowski, chief economic adviser at PwC in Warsaw.

“It looks like the finance ministry was trying to produce something that sounds like a big tax cut for political use, but was actually as small as possible.”

Separately on Monday, Poland’s prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki said the country would transfer all state-guaranteed private pension funds to individual retirement accounts as part of a long-awaited overhaul of the country’s pension system.",Polihs grasshooper citizen,/r/europe/comments/be3ymi/polands_ruling_party_rolls_out_tax_cut_in/el2xdel/,SlyScorpion,1555477785

Also, this will start an electroshock on the whole preservation/restoration projects around the country, which is needed since at least 15 years.

But, of course, there is a lot of PR here, and a lot of the big donations are in fact tax deductible, so the state will ""pay"" a lot (~60% deductible, and there is a push to 90%).

Efforts to create a unified anti-Brexit slate of candidates for next month’s European Parliament elections have fallen apart owing to UK poll rules and party rivalries, damping the long-term prospects for a centrist alliance. It means that voters in England will have to choose between at least three parties that are backing a second Brexit referendum: the Liberal Democrats, the Greens and newcomer Change UK. Labour has also held out the possibility of supporting another plebiscite, without making an explicit commitment. Voters in Scotland and Wales will also have the option of the Scottish National party and Plaid Cymru respectively, both of which have backed another referendum. Elections to the European Parliament, which will take place on May 23 in the UK unless parliament ratifies Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement beforehand, are being widely seen as a proxy for a new vote on whether to leave the EU. The elections in England, Scotland and Wales involve a proportional voting system dubbed the regional closed list. People cast their votes for the party they wish to support in regions. Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, had wanted an electoral alliance between his party and Change UK, which was formed by former Labour and Conservative MPs. He said in March it would be “very damaging for both sides” to be competing for votes. However, the Lib Dems and Change UK, previously known as the Independent Group, have been unable to reach an agreement. Under UK election rules, candidates from different parties cannot join together in a single anti-Brexit list. One proposal examined by the Lib Dems and Change UK was for the two parties, and the Greens, to form an anti-Brexit shell vehicle, specifically for the European elections, but the idea foundered. A senior Lib Dem figure said Change UK “weren’t interested” in an alliance, and wanted to use the elections “to try out their own brand”. A Change UK MP denied this, and said that the problem was time — the proposed new anti-Brexit shell vehicle would have required paperwork filed with the elections regulator several weeks ago, “when people didn’t know the European elections were happening”.

An alternative plan — for the Lib Dems and Change UK to stand aside for one another in different electoral regions — also failed. The Independent Group on Monday completed its registration as a political party, with the name Change UK. However, it will have no logo on ballot papers for the European elections after the Electoral Commission ruled that its proposed emblem — featuring the letters TIG and #change on a black background — was “likely to mislead voters”. The watchdog judged that the initials TIG were not sufficiently well known, while internet search results associated with #change could fluctuate dramatically in future. Critics of Change UK have questioned its strategy, arguing that its name is amorphous and that it has failed to build momentum since 11 MPs left Labour and the Conservatives to form the Independent Group in February and March. But Change UK, whose interim leader is Heidi Allen, said that 3,700 people had applied in less than a week to stand as its candidates in the European elections. The Change UK MP talked down the prospect of any future alliance with the Lib Dems — saying Sir Vince’s party had a “tarnished” brand, “never really confronted their demons” over participation in the 2010-15 coalition government with the Tories, and “are not going to be the future of the centre ground”. The Greens, who won more seats than the Lib Dems in the 2014 European elections, rejected the possibility of a unified slate of anti-Brexit candidates. The party said it would “resist any calls for us to stand alongside parties with whom we have fundamental ideological differences on austerity, economic policy and beyond”.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/be2xv5/efforts_to_forge_antibrexit_electoral_alliance/el2p1so/,nolesfan2011,1555470550

2567,"&gt;Yes but its about who can do what. 

Who you think has more room to reduce their emissions? Developing countries that barely consume anything and any reduction would likely necessitate just starving to death or Developed nations with tons of room to decrease their consumption? That's why per capita is more useful than totals, totals just tell you which country has bigger populations not which country has more ability and room to decrease their emissions. 


&gt;We can reduce our per capita emission in the west. But it doesnt matter the least bit if India and China increase their total emissions.

Each country's per capita emissions aren't independent of each other, if we in the west can reduce our per capita emissions levels China and India's will go down as well. Most of their emissions comes from making stuff for the west anyways.

&gt;""If the average person lived like a Indian the world would be fine."" Exactly not. Not unless China and India still reduce their total emissions. If they dont, you still get a climate crash. Thats the whole point. Reducing western per capita to indian levels isnt enough in its sum total.

China has a higher per capita emission than most European nations  they would have to reduce their emissions in that scenario as well. India has ridiculously low per capita emissions, india's per capita emissions is actually where the world should be if you want everything to be sustainable.

&gt;And thats all the mistake. There isnt a seperate argument because there isnt a seperate issue. Its one climate, one climate change.

Nothing you said changes the fact that its still a separate issue when it comes to developing countries. Telling developing countries whose population on average do not have much room to decrease their emissions without starving to death is completely useless. Yes developing countries have high totals that look scary but that is just a result of them having high populations. The average person in those countries do not have much emissions to reduce.

I have no idea why you think its a race issue, the people in those countries just simply do not emit much CO2. They are barely on the edge of poverty any reduction from them would just put them back into poverty. That's why developing countries are a separate issue, you don't have to consider people dying from poverty as a factor when reducing emissions in developed countries.",,/r/europe/comments/bdd9vi/macron_is_rejecting_eu_talks_with_america/el2pvoi/,ci425,1555471191

2654,"From a geostrategic point of view they get two desirable things. 
1. Russia throughout its history tried to establish safe and defendable borders. This has been reached in its north with the arctic ocean, in the east with the pacific ocean and in the south with various geographic obstacles. But to the west Russia has no significant protection as there is the northern european plane. Russian leaders throughout history saw this as an issue (look at Napoleon, the Swedes and Hitler as to why) and tried to create bufferzones. By anexing the Baltics, Russian leaders would get a desireable bufferzone. 
2. The second issue to consider is that every country that likes to be a global power needs to have secure access to the oceans all year long. Russian ports to the east are too far away from their industrial heartland in the west . Their ports at the Black Sea are vulnerable because the Bosporus can easily be blocked. Their ports to the north aren‘t ice free the whole year. By anexing the Baltics, Russia would get itself a well developed and ice free port in Klaipeda, Lithuania. 
Basically every NATO member should be aware of it. Older folks might remember that Russian bufferzones once reached until Central Europe, namely Germany, Austria and Italy. Some people how had to live in the former German Democratic Repulic told me that those times weren‘t as good as the lovely Soviet and modern Russian propaganda would like to make you believe. Those people said:“ The Russian was the Herrenmensch and we felt that every day. If a Russian soldier walked your way and you didn‘t want any problems, you better step aside and let him pass.“ 
So there is actually „something“ to fight for. But I totally agree with you that the price tag would be hefty and would outweight the benefits and the situation compared to Ukrain is diffrent. But at the same time you wouldn‘t spent so much money and time on propaganda about the Baltic states if you didn‘t have a plan for them. Maybe they aim more for something like the Brexit( yes they medled there too) and the Baltics joining the Russian federation.

But maybe I am completly wrong with this geopolitcal view( it‘s actually not mine). I hope so. Maybe global warming will safe the Baltics. Maybe even the trolls get feed up by the corrupt, life draining political system and their work that supports the destruction of the future of their children and conpatriots. Who knows? Ich nicht.

2791,"&gt; **Two high-ranking members of the student union violently mocked the national recollection that accompanied the Notre-Dame de Paris fire.  Ambiguous last night, their president Mélanie Luce deplores this morning at Le Figaro ""positions that are not those of the Unef"", while the association Avocats Sans Frontières will file a complaint.**

&gt; Last night, the vice-president of the UNEF LILLE and one of the members of the national office of the student association marked on the left tweeted their disgust and amusement at the national recollection caused by the historic fire at Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris.  Faced with the extent of reactions to their messages, they deleted their tweets and forced the president of the UNEF, Mélanie Luce, to react on the same network.  The latter did not condemn their comments but preferred to defend their positions by stating that there was no justification for harassing ""people who do not agree"".  Again, the comments were shocking and more than 400 people reacted to this message.  Mélanie Luce explains to Le Figaro this morning that she ""lacked clarity"" in her remarks and deplores positions that ""are not those of the One"".  For its part, the association Avocats Sans Frontières, through its president Gilles-William Goldnadel, announced that it would file a complaint.

&gt; **”Delirium of little whites""**

&gt; ""I don't care about Notre Dame de Paris because I don't care about the history of France I don't know what.""  This is the tweet that Hafsa Askar, the vice-president of Unef Lille, posted at 19:59, only one hour after the fire started.  Three minutes later, she continued her ever more violent invective: ""How far will people cry for bits of wood?  [...] You like the French identity too much when [...] objectively it's your delusion of little whites"".  And half an hour later, national office member Édouard Le Bert went there with his mocking projection: ""This is a national tragedy, a cathedral structure is burning"".

&gt; First, Mélanie Luce, President of the UNEF, began by defending the members of her office by stating that ""there is no justification for insulting, harassing, threatening rape and many other things to people who do not agree.  As a reminder, rape is a crime that affects 16% of women and destroys lives, not a banner to raise against someone with whom you disagree.  This notion of ""disagreement"" once again ignited the Internet users, who were more than 400 to respond, often violently to this tweet.

&gt; **""Unacceptable words, both in substance and in form""**

&gt; Mélanie Luce admitted this morning in Le Figaro that she had ""not been clear enough"", and this time clearly deplores ""positions that are not those of the One"", and ""unacceptable statements, both in terms of content and form"".  ""The cathedral is a symbol for all French people, Catholic or not,"" she continues.  It reflects the work of many people over 200 years and we are obviously sorry about last night's fire.""  The President thus confirmed that ""Notre-Dame is neither for whites nor for the racialized, it is emblematic for all”.

&gt; Mélanie Luce finally stated that a meeting will take place ""in the next few days"" to decide on the future of these two members of the association, whom she asked last night to delete the tweets.  ""We try to be careful about the people we recruit, but our main objective is also popular education.  We are not here to say,'You said that, so you're leaving', but rather to train our activists.

&gt; President of the Avocats Sans Frontières association, lawyer and essayist Gilles-William Goldnadel, who writes columns for Le Figaro, announced on Twitter that he would file a complaint against the student union.  ""A veiled president, racialized camps and a member of her national office who mocks the pain of the French people and insults whites, I find the UNEF perfectly coherent,"" he wrote.

2801,"&gt; I would say that the policy of Lenin and Stalin regarding ethnic/national groups and ""a right to secede"" is pretty much identical. Stalin was simply more direct and used more open-language regarding other ethnic groups, but both leaders never allowed any ethnic group to secede if it was possible to prevent that with force. As an example we can look at the wars of Independence of Latvia and Estonia. If Lenin had been serious when writing and speaking about ""rights of other nations"" and ""rights of secession"" then he would have made peace with both Latvia and Estonia much earlier not in 1919 when he was forced to sign peace treaties because of military loss in the war. Lenin is a original Stalinist.

I can see where you're coming from, but contrary to what Lenin had wrote in his works and articles, he then developed a different kind of standards. He, somehow viewed elections in Estonia as the outcome of what Estonian bourgeoise and class collaborators had wanted. It was sure unfair and contrary to his original claims and arguments, but then what Lenin wanted was having a gate to Scandinavia, and more importantly to Central Europe and especially Germany, and the revolutions there. He was looking out for spread of the social revolution, and aiding and uniting with the socialists in Hungary, Bavaria, ""whole Germany and Austria, and Europe"". Of course, that plans have been failed, as well as the revolutions in Hungary and Germany, and the goal of social revolution in Europe has been left out. I'd like to give the guy some credit anyway though, and understand the circumstances even if I don't like his decisions to left his own principals.

&gt; And I think this is also very apparent and clear in Russia, I haven't heard any praise given to Lenin by Russians for his fictional ideas of ""rights of other nations"" and ""rights of secession"", so I doubt Putin dislikes Lenin because of this.

Actually, Putin himself openly said all those things. He talked about “letting your rule be guided by thoughts is right, but only when that idea leads to the right results, not like it did with Vladimir Ilich,” and criticised Lenin for ""providing regions with autonomy, and so on"", ""republics being equal"", ""right to secede"" and accused of ""planting an atomic bomb under the building that is called Russia which later exploded"". Before, he wasn't talking this openly other than the ""treasonous acts making us lose WWI"", but in recent years, he started to speak about these more openly.

&gt; Also Lenin will not be removed while Putin is in office because he needs to keep up the myth about the ""good times"" when Soviet Union still existed and that the collapse of Soviet Union was bad, as that legitimizes his current inefficient and economically ruinous rule of Russia.

He won't be doing that for not creating open enemies and divisions, but good times Putin refers to is about Stalin and later Soviet times when they were ""stronk"", etc. He openly blames Lenin for the collapse and the ""separatism"" in RuFed. His Soviet myth clearly excludes Lenin, and October revolution to the limit of celebrating Stalin's revolution celebration in the height of WWII.",An Adjar born in Tuscany,/r/europe/comments/bdre7x/cathedral_of_christ_the_saviour_in_moscow_fully/el1n762/,adjarteapot,1555444091

2878,"&gt;but they will never be taken seriously if they are consistently seen as a tool used to undermine discussion of women's problems.

I don't get it. 

I mean, I understand that if you talk about women's issues and a random person comes to you and says ""so, why don't we talk about men's issues?"" is annoying. Ok, I totally get it, is like when you're trying to tell a story to your friend and the friend interrupts you saying: ""ok, ok, let's talk about my day"". 

But this two type of issues need imho to be analyzed together. How can I know that the partner violence against women is high if I can't compare to the other types of partner violence (F-&gt;M, M-&gt;M, F-&gt;F)? It is difficult to say (this, I think, is what OP was trying to say). 

The problem is that nobody gives a fuck of men's issues, not the right, nor the left. The problem is that we have few studies about men, and nobody cares. We can't compare the phenomena because nobody (almost) study the ""men side"", and saying this, is not highjacking the real problems of women.

I'm not against feminism or talking about the real problems of women. I am for embed this discussion with the one of the male issues, and comparing them. But right now, even in this discussion, many people think that men simply have not gender issues, or think that are issues of ""second order"" respect to women's gender issues.",,/r/europe/comments/bdsd06/violence_against_woman_in_the_lifetime/el1ok4n/,RifRafRof,1555444875

*‘Have you ever heard about Sykes’s yellow dog?’ said I to the spokesman of the delegation. He said he hadn’t. ‘Well, I must tell you about him,’ said I. ‘Sykes had a yellow dog he set great store by, but there were a lot of small boys around the village, and that’s always a bad thing for dogs, you know. These boys didn’t share Sykes’s views, and they were not disposed to let the dog have a fair show. Even Sykes had to admit that the dog was getting unpopular; in fact, it was soon seen that a prejudice was growing up against that dog that threatened to wreck all his future prospects in life. The boys, after meditating how they could get the best of him, finally fixed up a cartridge with a long fuse, put the cartridge in a piece of meat, dropped the meat in the road in front of Sykes’s door, and then perched themselves on a fence a good distance off with the end of the fuse in their hands. Then they whistled for the dog. When he came out he scented the bait, and bolted the meat, cartridge and all. The boys touched off the fuse with a cigar, and in about a second a report came from that dog that sounded like a small clap of thunder. Sykes came bouncing out of the house, and yelled: ‘What’s up! Anything busted?’ There was no reply, except a snicker from the small boys roosting on the fence; but as Sykes looked up he saw the whole air filled with pieces of yellow dog. He picked up the biggest piece he could find — a portion of the back, with a part of the tail still hanging to it, and, after turning it around and looking it all over, he said, ‘Well, I guess he’ll never be much account again — as a dog.’*",,/r/europe/comments/bdqghb/the_beautiful_rose_window_was_spared/el1awae/,whogivesashirtdotca,1555436800

Women in Switzerland gained the right to vote in federal elections after a referendum in February 1971.

not false, and I ^(addressed that) in my last comment

&gt; Hire more people or adapt your business model.

Using YouTube as an example, a hours of video are posted **every SECOND**, even if YouTube hired every human on the planet they would probably be unable to keep up, and this isn't even factoring in factors such as human error or the fact that all these people need to be payed. most sites would probobly need less people to be hired then YouTube, but at the same time expecting a mass increse of human content reviewers who can review all the new content on there site before it can go live is not a reasonable expectason for sites like Google, much less a smaller site. and is gerenteed to let stuff that shouldn't be allowed thew cos there is not a human in the world who knows all copyrighted content in egsisdence as opposed to a bot witch requires no pay, can review stuff WAY WAY WAY faster then a human, and has a massive database of kolige. and most sites are going to go with the more convenient option that's more likely to not get then screwed over by acadent.

&gt; Blame Youtube for their system. The problem with them is income is taken away and when the copyright claim is resolved, it is not returned. That is 100% on Youtube.

I used YouTube as an example cos it's the best example for the kind of bot system that would be needed and the type that most company's are going to adopt under Article 13

&gt; I guess the actual text of the directive is an ""unreliable sorse"" then.

The basic text is what lawmakers will use to make the laws the copyright derictive will spawn, but it's long, written in a way that is hard to read, contradicts it's self in places, and is intencanly written in such a way as to word off criticism without chageing it's acuaol functions. most people are not going to be able to read that and as such Alt. sorses who can are better alternatives. 

*But if you can read the text and can read between the lines and BS and have the time to do so, then reading the actual text of the directive would be the sole exipson to the EU government is an unreliable souse.

&gt; Nonsense

Exipt that it's true, and just saying ""Nonsense"" dos not change that

&gt; I recommend actually looking at the sources from the EU, since that would be the actual directive itself.

The EU goverment is made up of indaviguols who don't know / care about what the derictive will actually do, and polotisons who are going out of there way to make the EU music industry who are pushing it happy, therefore, they are not a reliable sorse*

#The AfD has to pay a 400.000 € fine

* Schäuble has officially signed first fines totalling 402,900 euros against the AfD in the illegal donations affair.


* The donations were election campaign aids for party leader Meuthen and federal board member Reil.

*By Katja Riedel, Sebastian Pittelkow and Jens Schneider, Berlin*

The Bundestag administration has for the first time imposed fines on the party in the AfD campaign fundraising affair. On Tuesday, Bundestags President Wolfgang Schäuble signed the first fines totalling 402,900 euros. In two cases, it suspects illegal political donations. This was announced by the Bundestag administration at the request of WDR, NDR and Süddeutscher Zeitung. The donations were campaign aids for party leader Jörg Meuthen and federal board member Guido Reil.

The two top AfD politicians received free election posters, flyers, homepages and newspaper advertisements from the Swiss agency Goal AG Jörg to support them as direct candidates in state election campaigns. However, they had not declared these donations to the Bundestag administration as party donations, because according to their own statements they had not considered them to be party donations. According to the Bundestag administration on Tuesday, these monetary donations, which were granted free of charge, are actually to be considered party donations.

""In the course of the administrative investigation, it was confirmed that these non-cash donations should not have been accepted by the AfD, as the donors could not have been identified at the time the donation was accepted,"" the statement continues. As a result of this violation of the Political Parties Act, a claim for payment against AfD in the amount of three times the unlawfully accepted donation amounts arose. These amounted to 269,400 euros in the case of Meuthen and 133,500 euros in the case of Reil.

Meuthen is also the top candidate of the AfD for the European elections, Reil is second on the list. The party denies the accusation of illegal party financing and claims that people are trying to damage the party in the European election campaign. The party announced weeks ago that it would sue if fines were imposed on it.

Assuming we map this directly onto the initial referendum and take IDK's as voting the same way, and only switch those that are saying they would consider revising their vote (which would be a poor way of doing it, but, hey..) then:

Total number of valid votes was 33,551,983

Leave got 17,410,742 in the referendum, would lose 1,218,751 (7%) of those and gain 645,650 remainers (4%). That'd mean 16,837,641 voting leave.

Remain got 16,141,241 in the referendum, would lose 645,650 (4%) of those and gain 1,218,751 leavers (7%) That'd mean 16,714342 voting remain.

So the referendum would go  to leave 16,837,641 votes to 16,714,342  (50.18% vs 49.82%)

But obviously there are a slew of other factors from new voters, non-voters, IDK's in this poll, and, probably most importantly, that things would likely shift in any run-up to a referendum (a second referendum isn't nearly as popular as the first).",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/bdsyoo/voters_now_more_sure_they_voted_the_right_way_in/el0yznl/,-ah,1555429650

3046,"Thank you for the reply, you make some very interesting points. Allow me to comment on a few of them. 

First of all, the difference between art and architecture is, in my opinion, not limited to the size. Architecture has a functional aspect, where art (in general) doesn't. You could argue that a no longer catholic cathedral doesn't have a lot of functionality anymore, I'll give you that. 

Architecture, and even individual buildings have always been reformed, for better and, often, for worse. But it's kind of the nature of a historical object in a contemporary context: it's bound to change. 

You associate 'contemporary architecture' with the soulless industrial style that started in the late nineteenth century (ironically, think of the Eiffel tower) and has dominated large parts of cities ever since. However, true contemporary architecture is more about relating a building to the context it's in. I'm not saying that always happens, but that's at least the vision some important offices share today.

I disagree with your last sentence, I think reinterpreting the Notre Dame is possible, not only by not imitating it, but on the other hand: maybe only possible by not imitating it. The comparison to the Chinese reconstructions is far-fetched, I agree. I mainly used it to point out the importance of historical context but you obviously make a fair point with it being in exactly the same spot.

As for the Notre Dame: maybe an exact replica from what it looked like 2 days ago IS the best option for the building after all. It's just not the only option nor should it be a no-brainer. Take the spire for example. The one that was destroyed was only added in the nineteenth century. Does it make sense to repair that as well? I don't know. 

This is all open for discussion obviously, and I appreciated reading your opinion.",,/r/europe/comments/bdnyic/french_billionaire_pledges_100_million_euros_to/el0zp9k/,TheWeirdShape,1555430062

Problem is... money that were acquired from selling that grain, were used to build factories that 20 years later saved eastern Europe from Generalplan Ost. More over Ukraine left USSR debt-free, most wealthy region of USSR, with immense industrial( AN bureau, best rocket industry in the world at the moment, kinda capable electronics industry etc) and immense agrarian capacity. Current ukrainian government just using this rhetoric to play ""US vs THEM"", ""Russia always puts down Ukraine""(kinda like black people in US like to complain) to excuse 30 years of failures that ended up in... well... civil war... that became later simultaneously proxy war between Russia and US and a war between ukrainian oligarchs... and not so bright future.

If you'd do a little bit more reading up on it, you'd see that that's only in the context I spoke of.

&gt; Also you're saying that the Netherlands formed as confederation of sovereigns states and then also say that the federal model wouldn't work, and then you also say that you advocate for a unitary state?

Confederations and federations are two different things. Also, that was centuries ago.

&gt; The 'United States of Belgium' does have a nice ring to it, like the United States of America

To you maybe. First, the association with the US would be terrible and nobody would want that. Secondly, that insistence on calling it Belgium seems odd and desparate. ""We'll join your country, but only if you rename yourselves to our country!""; then just don't join.

&gt; No, we'd be merging our nations into a new one.

Flanders has a population of 6,4 million. The Netherlands has a population of 17 million. And we don't have any internal ""let's break up"" issues. *You* do.

Fraud / identity theft can indeed be a problem, but a very small one in the grander scheme of things.

Mandatory ID is a complete overreaction to a very small problem.

If they dont, you still get a climate crash. Thats the whole point. Reducing western per capita to indian levels isnt enough in its sum total.

&gt; Total emissions are also based on countries borders just like per capita

Which is why its so important to point it out. Because we cant change theirs, they have to do it, and as long as you allow per capita to act as convenient smokescreen they wont.

&gt; The developing countries thing is a whole separate argument, they're allowed to increase their emissions because they need to grow their economies.

&gt; The 12% increase in the wealth of the very richest contrasted with a fall of 11% in the wealth of the poorest half of the world’s population.

At what point will you start to see a problem? You know it's a zero sum game, right? We can create value and prosperity in all sorts of ways, but when it comes to money, outside of governments printing bills, ""making money"" simply is an euphemism for shifting it from somewhere else to yourself.

Though I don't agree with bitching at the one guy who makes a donation, it's a general and more systemic issue, and not everybody who is rich is necessarily a greedy crook. But at the same time, I know that rich people *can* be greedy just for the sake of it, and something like ""I want 20% more"" will always apply, no matter how rich a person is, even if it's just adding zeroes to an already meaningless number. So in general, apart from this context, I agree with the point.

Here's why it matters:

&gt; If machines produce everything we need, the outcome will depend on how things are distributed. Everyone can enjoy a life of luxurious leisure if the machine-produced wealth is shared, or most people can end up miserably poor if the machine-owners successfully lobby against wealth redistribution. So far, the trend seems to be toward the second option, with technology driving ever-increasing inequality.

-- Stephen Hawking

&gt; Hobbes was the true, though never fully recognized, philosopher of the bourgeoisie because he realized that acquisition of wealth conceived as a never-ending process can be guaranteed only by the seizure of political power, for the accumulating process must sooner or later force open all existing territorial limits. He foresaw that a society which had entered the path of never-ending acquisition had to engineer a dynamic political organization capable of a corresponding never-ending process of power generation. He even, through sheer force of imagination, was able to outline the main psychological traits of the new type of man who would fit into such a society and its tyrannical body politic. He foresaw the necessary idolatry of power itself by this new human type, that he would be flattered at being called a power-thirsty animal, although actually society would force him to surrender all his natural forces, his virtues and his vices, and would make him the poor meek little fellow who has not even the right to rise against tyranny, and who, far from striving for power, submits to any existing government and does not stir even when his best friend falls an innocent victim to an incomprehensible raison d'etat.

&gt; For a Commonwealth based on the accumulated and monopolized power of all its individual members necessarily leaves each person powerless, deprived of his natural and human capacities. It leaves him degraded into a cog in the power-accumulating machine, free to console himself with sublime thoughts about the ultimate destiny of this machine, which itself is constructed in such a way that it can devour the globe simply by following its own inherent law.

&gt; The ultimate destructive purpose of this Commonwealth is at least indicated in the philosophical interpretation of human equality as an ""equality of ability"" to kill. Living with all other nations ""in the condition of a perpetual war, and upon the confines of battle, with their frontiers armed. and canons planted against their neighbors round about,"" it has no other law of conduct but the ""most conducing to [its] benefit"" and will gradually devour weaker structures until it comes to a last war ""which provideth for every man, by Victory, or Death.

&gt; By ""Victory or Death,"" the Leviathan can indeed overcome all political limitations that go with the existence of other peoples and can envelop the whole earth in its tyranny. But when the last war has come and every man has been provided for, no ultimate peace is established on earth: the power-accumulating machine, without which continual expansion would not have been achieved, needs more material to devour in its never-ending process. If the last victorious Commonwealth cannot proceed to ""annex the planets,"" it can only proceed to destroy itself in order to begin anew the never-ending process of power generation.

-- Hannah Arendt, ""The Origins of Totalitarianism""

&gt; Charity is the drowning of rights in the shithole of mercy.

-- Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi

And once you got rid of the rights -- in practice it's enough if people care more about trinkets than about the rights they possess at least on paper, and in the minds of thinkers with whom they lost all connection -- it opens up all sorts of possibilities.

&gt; The frightening coincidence of the modern population explosion with the discovery of technical devices that, through automation, will make large sections of the population 'superfluous' even in terms of labor, and that, through nuclear energy, make it possible to deal with this twofold threat by the use of instruments beside which Hitler's gassing installations look like an evil child's fumbling toys, should be enough to make us tremble.

3631,"I’m no carpenter, but based on my time inside the charpente, I think you would need at least 1.5 shitloads of wood.

Seriously, though, it is a lot of wood but more importantly it is HUGE beams. They used the biggest trees they could get back in the late thirteenth or early fourteenth century, and those were much bigger than anything you could cut in France now.

As for decoration, there was zero detail on the wood in the charpente. It was not visible unless you were inside the roof. It’s entirely structural with no decorative elements at all. I don’t know how they do these things, but I wonder if they could replace the wood with some lighter, stronger, more fireproof modern substitute — it wouldn’t change the anything visible about the church at all, but might give it a safer and sturdier skeleton.

It’s a huge amount of lead, of course, but I’d say it’s a fairly thin layer of lead. The roof itself is really just a fancy lead umbrella for the vault.

The roof has decorative detail, especially the filigree along the roof ridge, but it’s so highly documented they should be able to recreate it perfectly. Even just the photos I took of it when I was up there would probably be enough reference to do it. The roof was beautiful, but it was fairly plain as gothic structures go. There were a few statues, but they were nineteenth-century rather than medieval, and it sounds from som articles like they had already removed them for restoration. So we’re talking about a pretty functional piece of construction, very similar to many other gothic cathedral roofs — not, thank God, something highly decorated like a facade portal. So far, from what I’ve seen, the great decorative art of Notre-Dame may be mostly intact.

3688,"Original Comment

&gt; Of course it's not the real one, it never happened. There's no evidence Jesus even existed outside of the Bible.
Here is all the evidence that exists:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_Jesus#Non-biblical_sources
You've only got a couple of supposed mentions of him outside the bible and the originals are all missing or have been tampered with. Here are the 4 sources they list:
Thallos - Original is missing. We have no idea what it says or if it even mentioned Jesus at all.
Josephus and Tacitus - A tiny mention of him and we know the material was tampered with and it was written 70 years after Jesus died. Who knows where he got his info from. It's such a small part of the book that the guy could have just been reporting rumours.
Talmud - Written hundreds of years after Jesus and he is never mentioned by name
Mara bar Serapion - Also doesn't mentioned Jesus by name, just talks about a Jew king getting killed. Lacking a lot of detail. Tenuous connections at best.
So maybe there was some trivial Jewish leader who got killed. That wouldn't be surprising. To claim any of this supports the story of Jesus as the crown of thrones is rediculous.",,/r/europe/comments/bdil88/notre_dame_is_on_fire/ekzlfqa/,Oh_how_far_ive_come,1555379123

3694,"You know, I'll bite, too.

Unlike kinderneuker99 I do actually believe that the Directive will result in a de-facto requirement for automated filters at least for the large corporations. There's no other way around it, whilst at the same time the proportionality clause will leave small businesses exempt from them, thus preserving the ""no general monitoring obligation"" (since it'd be selective. some might call this underhanded, but ultimately it's just legalese).

However, what you seem to forget, or are simply not aware of, is that the Directive also includes a ""counterweight"" clause regarding the preservation of content that does not infringe on copyright. Here, from Article 17 Paragraph 7:

*""The cooperation between online content-sharing service providers and rightholders shall not result in the prevention of the availability of works or other subject matter uploaded by users, which do not infringe copyright and related rights, including where such works or other subject matter are covered by an exception or limitation""*

Meaning, if someone uses a filter to conform to Paragraph 4 Subsection C regarding the prevention of re-upload of removed copyrighted content, this filter will have to be configured in a way to strike a balance between removing content that infringes upon copyright and preserving content that does not.

&gt; The startup protections are laughable: less than three years old, less than 3 million users? How is this supposed to protect European companies, and help them compete with the Americans?

I think we should not forget about Paragraph 5:

*""In determining whether the service provider has complied with its obligations under paragraph 4, and in light of the principle of proportionality, the following elements, among others, shall be taken into account: (a) the type, the audience and the size of the service and the type of works or other subject matter uploaded by the users of the service; and (b) the availability of suitable and effective means and their cost for service providers.""*

Of course, any kind of regulation is going to limit business opportunity at some point, but I don't think we should compromise on our environmental or health &amp; safety protections just to be more competitive with the US either. Besides, the American companies we are competing with have a presence in the EU as well, anyways, and as such are subject to the Directive like everyone else. It's a little step towards putting the companies on equal footing by closing loopholes that have allowed certain megacorps to get as big as they are now and use their market position to bully partners into compliance.

I was heavily trained in the game of chickens and I was the most powerful sniper of the entire American armed forces. You are just another small goal for me. I will erase you from this earth with great precision, just like you never existed in this world, give me my words. Do you think that you can escape from me on the Internet? Think about it again, stupid. When I spoke, I was already contacting my secret cyber spy across the United States and your IP address has been tracked, so you'd better be prepared to face the storm, you are awkward. This storm will completely wipe out your poor little life-like gadgets. I can exist anywhere, any time, and I can kill you in more than seven hundred ways, this is only in the case of my empty hand. I have not only received a lot of training in empty-handed fighting, but I also have the right to command all the forces of the US Marine Corps, and I will fully utilize this power to take your little ass from your position. The poor face of the mainland was erased. If you can understand how unclean your little ""comments"" have caused to yourself, maybe you fucking will close your stinky mouth.

Reinstate the ways of old in which men had some notion of understanding, when they didn't mistake the symbols for the essence. If men mourn a building, then Jesus the Christ's teachings were not well-received in the minds of men.

Notre Dame was covered in secret alchemical symbolism, hidden in plain sight. The only way to preserve that ancient knowledge and keep it away from the empty-headed men, was to shove it under their nose with a veil of symbols that wear their superstition's mask.

A time has now come where this knowledge can flourish more freely. There is no more need for a cathedral veiled in Christian symbolism.

It’s so off base to assume I don’t have any empathy. You have no idea who I am or what I’ve been through (even in the event of a major loss). Telling me I’m not human enough because of what I said is a laughable idea. 

Is the cathedral your house? Did you grow up there for the majority of your life? Make memories there? I’m guessing not, so it’s literally the worst analogy you could make when the most you said you’ve done is write something about the cathedral. 

Your last paragraph also doesn’t apply to me. I said in my comment that it’s fine to be sad or mourn the loss of a historical building. I also never called them a loser but if I understand correctly you were saying that about other people and not me. I never said you should or shouldn’t do anything. My only claim was that I, myself, do not understand how it’s possible for a person to cry over a building when your only connection to that building is a piece of writing.... like yeah if you proposed to someone there or married there I would understand. But to physically cry? That just makes me think you’re soft as fuck and maybe you need to see a psychologist if a building burning down makes you cry. Lmfao like i don’t even care do what you want with your own life.

And I'm pretty sure that the people who lived in them were well aware that they were not intended to be military fortifications, same as people who visit Disneyland.  Well, okay, maybe  if you're six years old and a patron, you're not.

&gt; Old Town Hall (Slovak: Stará radnica, Hungarian: Régi városháza) is a complex of buildings from the 14th century in the Old Town of Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia. It is the oldest city hall in the country and it is one of the oldest stone buildings still standing in Bratislava, with the tower being built approximately in 1370.

-

&gt; Later, the Old Town Hall underwent many transformations and enhancements, namely a Renaissance style reconstruction in 1599 following earthquake damage, Baroque restyling to the tower after a fire in the 18th century, and the addition of a Neo-Renaissance/neogothic wing built in 1912.[3]

&gt;When assessing whether an online content-sharing service provider has made its best efforts in accordance with the high industry standards of professional diligence, account should be taken of whether the service provider has taken all the steps that would be taken by a diligent operator to achieve the result of preventing the availability of unauthorised works or other subject matter on its website, taking into account best industry practices and the effectiveness of the steps taken in light of all relevant factors and developments, as well as the principle of proportionality. For the purposes of that assessment, a number of elements should be considered, such as the size of the service, the evolving state of the art as regards existing means, including potential future developments, to avoid the availability of different types of content and the cost of such means for the services. Different means to avoid the availability of unauthorised copyright-protected content could be appropriate and proportionate depending on the type of content, and, therefore, it cannot be excluded that in some cases availability of unauthorised content can only be avoided upon notification of rightholders.

4266,"&gt;Can you prove it?

Until last year, London had topped the GFC index (now slightly behind NYC). The UK is the second largest conduit OFC (behind the Netherlands) and 18 of the 24 sink OFCs are UK crown dependencies, such as the British Virgin Islands, Bermuda, Gibraltar and so on.

&gt;Not for long

Britain and France have similarly balanced militaries (though the UK has a carrier to be launched in the coming year and a fleet of F-35s to enter service), there's a lot of debate but they're essentially joint top, not including Russia. Germany's military is frankly pathetic and barely stronger than Poland's.

Economically, Germany is the most powerful by GDP, but London is a much larger financial hub than any city in Germany, and the UK has a much more powerful economy than France. Russia is pathetic in this regard.

Hence, you can see the UK comes out top when you take it all into consideration and there's no real reason for that to change, especially as the UK has the fastest growing economy of the lot and two major military assets entering service this year.

But most importantly, especially when it comes to military alliances, countries with converging interests. Russia meddling with Lithuania has very direct consequences for the EU, and mechanically all its members. It has none for the US.


&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Looking at some of people responses, both here, and politicians it seems this EU army is often presented in contrast to NATO. The words might not be used, but the context is clear, this EU army is an attempt at further separation from the USA.

Of course it is presented in contrast to NATO, and it should be: it's about having a military alliance of our own, rather than through a structure that is, if I'm allowed to vastly exaggerate for the sake of the argument, the modern equivalent of the Delian League, with the US playing the role of Athen.

NATO is an entirely anachronistic structure, created for a purpose that have since vanished. It doesn't mean it should disappear altogether, it can survive and evolve.

4386,"&gt;you want us to give up our little military too?

This is, ironically, exactly what you're already pledged to do as a NATO member whenever the alliance is activated. In case you didn't fully realise what being a member of NATO means.

And it's not about ""giving up"" your military anyway. It's not about merging armies. It's about pooling together existing and future military ressources under a European command, rather than an American one. 

Which doesn't even remotely prevent the EU from partnering with the US, by the way.

I don't understand why so many people struggle that much to understand such a simple concept.

&amp;nbsp

&gt;It's the west that seems to be positioning EU army as somehow opposite to US

It's not positioning as *opposite* to the US, but as *independent* from the US. I know, very subtle difference.

&amp;nbsp

&gt;And crying when US asks to beef up our own armies. (...)

&gt;(...) Or will West somehow beef up their spending once it becomes a common army?

Except European countries don't need to ""beef up"" their spendings. Currently, the EU has a combined military budget of ~200 billion euros and nearly 2 million active personnel. Which is **a lot**: it places the EU second worldwide, behind the US.

I know there are a lot of rhetorics going on from the Trump administration regarding how Europeans don't invest enough as NATO members. But just because the US have an overbloated budget doesn't mean European countries have underfunded budgets. They have budgets tailored to their *actual needs*.

The US invests a fuckton of money in their military not because they care about NATO or their European allies, but first and foremost because it serves their own geopolitical and economic interests. Do you have any idea how many jobs and industries in the US are directly or indirectly relying on military spendings? The answer is: [**an awful fucking lot**](http://www.ncsl.org/research/military-and-veterans-affairs/military-s-impact-on-state-economies.aspx).

Some time ago, [some random guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg-jvHynP9Y) already pointed out this might happen.

European countries aren't maintaining Cold War-era military budgets, because the Cold War is over.

The US, on the other end, never broke the trend of massive military investments that started with WW2, even after the Cold War ended, because it has become an integral part of the American economy.

4453,"&gt; Are you sure Nigel Farage Is the Russian stooge though? Winning Brexit like that then going to host a show on LBC and more recently splitting the UKIP vote?

I think you misunderstand what's going on here. Russia doesn't primarily care about the UK leaving the EU. What they do care about is the political standstill the process entails. Russia did fund pro-Trump as well as pro-Hillary groups indirectly in 2016. Their aim is to destabilize, not to further any particular outcome.

In that light, Farrage is actually perfect. Not only did he instigate a lot of the initial uproar against the EU, he now passively prolongs the exit itself. The UK didn't do much meaningful political work in basically the past 18 months (or even longer). And that will go on at least until the next deadline. That's **perfect** for Russia. Imagine the referndum going 70-30 pro-remain and people protesting for more integration. A EU army would already be much closer if not a reality already.

And you can bet your ass that should the SNP call for a referendum to split from the UK, Russian money would be all over it ... on both sides. That would mean a further year or more of political standstil in parts of GB.

&gt; Sounds like an establishment stooge to me.

You already start to fall for that kind of thinking. The enemy is not your establishment (whatever you want to define that as). The enemy is sliding political culture. It's foreig autocratic regimes trying to influence our political systems. If you think politicians, even Farrage, are the enemy, you are already part of the problem, because you are that less likely to vote and thus making it more likely for radical groups (which have an easier driver to vote) to capture more of the legislative body.",Austria,/r/europe/comments/bd0k3x/russia_trying_to_meddle_in_eu_elections/ekxn55y/,jacenat,1555329379

4471,"&gt; This is, ironically, exactly what you're already pledged to do as a NATO member whenever the alliance is activated. In case you didn't fully realise what being a member of NATO means.

&gt; And it's not about ""giving up"" your military anyway. It's not about merging armies. It's about delegating and pooling together existing and future military ressources under a European command, rather than an American one.

Article 5 doesn't change chain of command. You may want to double-check your knowledge on NATO. There's no pooling of resources under US rule.

European countries already pool together and coordinate purchases under NATO. Common standards, training side by side etc.

&gt; Which doesn't even remotely prevent the EU from partnering with the US, by the way.

Yet many people present EU army as countermeasure against US. But I agree that technically it doesn't prevent that.

That used to be the case. There were strong suspicions of fraud, with the pollsters being accused of pressuring people to declare French as their mother tongue.

Furthermore, while ""knowing one's languages"" was and is considered a virtue in Flanders, French speakers considered French a sign of higher status and Dutch a language of peasants, so Dutch to French often turned out to be a one way track, so the theory of a free individual choice didn't really work out, and it wouldn't be appropriate to reward to side that was unwilling to learn the other language to grow at the expense of the more open one.",Limburg,/r/europe/comments/bdcj30/purchasing_power_in_german_speaking_countries/ekxnca8/,silverionmox,1555329606

4610,"Their result was better than expected, and the followup lead to the disintegration of the liberal-conservative alliance that was the only political force that has really challenged the social democrats in an existential manner in a hundred years almost.

They're in a better position now than they've been in for at least a decade. Dealing with anti-abortion, thinly veiled racism and christianity being shoved down your throat alongside your tax-cutter politics is going to be a lot easier than dealing with the ""selfish goodness"" the alliance offered, that promised you could both be a progressive liberal who's all about gay rights and stuff while also believing in reducing the welfare state.

4722,"&gt; You're just a propagandist for turkey

So every uncomfortable truth pointed out about Kurdish culture is suddenly propaganda? How convenient.

One of the very first Kurdish uprisings against Turks was Sheikh Said rebellion, where Kurds wanted to revive the Islamic Caliphate and were against the new secular Turkish republic. Really sounds like ""Kurds being kept down through religion"", right? Don't forget that Kurds are Muslims themselves, far more conservative Muslims than their neighbors too.

Kurds have some traditions (female circumsision, sister swapping, feodalism) that none of their neighbors normally practice and lead in honor killings and female illiteracy everywhere they live, Iraqi Kurdistan has been autonomous for years and yet honor killings and FGM are not only many times more prevalent there than in the rest of Iraq, but they actually skyrocketed there since Iraqi Kurdistan gained autonomy. In Turkey polygamy is explicitly banned and the government has launched many programs to battle illiteracy among Kurdish women and prevent honor killings, but Kurds responded by doubling down on these practices instead. You can't keep blaming others considering that you do things nobody else around you does and that you refused every attempt to civilize you for years.

This is why your dream of a secular, progressive Kurdistan will never be reality - left-wing millitants can post pictures of female fighters 24/7 and brag about how ""democratic"" and ""free"" Rojava is, but this will never change what 90% of Kurds populating ""Kurdistan"" would be like - conservative, fundamentalist tribal misogynists that practice FGM, honor killings, feodalism and sister swapping, refuse to let women even get education and force them into arranged marriages where they're expected to live as incubators for 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10 children and stay quiet.",,/r/europe/comments/b7touq/aftermath_of_turkish_local_elections_erdogans/ekx9ve2/,CompostMalone,1555308045

Orwell commenting on the English intelligentsia, note that he isnt talking about the working class here

&gt;In intention, at any rate, the English intelligentsia are Europeanized. They take their cookery from Paris and their opinions from Moscow. In the general patriotism of the country they form a sort of island of dissident thought. England is perhaps the only great country whose intellectuals are ashamed of their own nationality. In left-wing circles it is always felt that there is something slightly disgraceful in being an Englishman and that it is a duty to snigger at every English institution, from horse racing to suet puddings. It is a strange fact, but it is unquestionably true that almost any English intellectual would feel more ashamed of standing to attention during “God save the King” than of stealing from a poor box.

Look it's simple. There's just been an election.

Right now hundreds of SECULAR Kurdish HDP mayors should  be ruling Kurdish cities, if turkey was a true democracy. 

Except it's not. The islamist fascist government AKP has denied the HDP to take office and AKP are still ruling the cities through non elected mayors and governors. 

This is what happened at the last election too. 

Kurds keep trying elect SECULAR parties and want to secularise Kurdish areas, but Turks are keeping down every effort of modernisation, and are not even letting the SECULAR Kurdish party take office.

Women's has been basically always Canada and USA always blowing out anybody else with Sweden and more rarely Finland occasionally giving them a close game. Finland beat Canada in the semis, and should have (I say this as a American) been credited with the win here. What makes it so much worse is that the tournament was held in Espoo, Finland.

&gt;The Copernicus Sentinel-1 mission takes us over the busy maritime traffic passing through the English Channel.  
&gt;  
&gt;The two identical Copernicus Sentinel-1 satellites carry radar instruments, which can see through clouds and rain, and in the dark, to image Earth’s surface below. Here, hundreds of radar images spanning 2016 to 2018 over the same area have been, compressed into a single image.  
&gt;  
&gt;The sea surface reflects the radar signal away from the satellite, making water appear dark in the image. This contrasts metal objects, in this case ships, which appear as bright dots in the dark water. Boats that passed the English Channel in 2016 appear in blue, those from 2017 appear in green, and those from 2018 appear in red.  
&gt;  
&gt;Owing to its narrowness, as well as its strategic connection of the Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea, the Channel is very busy with east-west ship traffic. Because of the volume of vessels passing through daily, a two-lane scheme is used, in order to avoid collisions. The two lanes can easily be detected in the image.  
&gt;  
&gt;Many vessels crossing at the narrowest part of the English Channel can be seen in the far right of the image. Connecting Dover in England to Calais in northern France, the Strait of Dover is another major route, with over 400 vessels crossing every day. The shortest distance across the Channel is just 33 km, making it possible to see the opposite coastline on a clear day.  
&gt;  
&gt;The cities of London and Paris, other towns and buildings and even wind turbines in the English Channel are visible in white owing to the strong reflection of the radar signal.",,/r/europe/comments/bdbvrc/english_channel_20_mb/ekx4mz3/,ueberklaus,1555301995

5055,"&gt;this is pretty much the opposite of my experience living in the UK.

Could be possible, I only get my info from reading around.

But by 'right' I meant more right-far right parties, not centre ""right"" parties like Tories or CDU which you were focusing on. So, FvD, Lega Nord, FN, PiS, Fidesz etc and their equivalents, or lack thereof, in the UK.

&gt;The biggest media influences are either elements of the traditional British right wing media (Daily Mail etc), Murdoch right wing media (The Sun, Sky etc), domestic TV news (BBC Centre-right, ITV Right Wing, Channel 4 Centre).

Mostly old people consume that media. British youth in general are fairly left wing compared to continentals. Check this out: 

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45098550

Seems the 18-35 crowd mostly approves of the EU, immigration and keeping free movement of labour. It's just the older generation holding the Tories and right wing publications aloft. 

&gt;But I would have thought US Media would pull right wing rather than left wing.

I think it's more the common language and in general dispersion of US media throughout the Anglosphere that's the root cause. And besides Fox News, there isn't really any mainstream US channel that supports Trump. He's more or less enemies with the MSM and only has a large following with alternative outlets.

The curveball in this game is Finns Party (PS) at 35 seats (-3), and the biggest loser is Centre (Kesk) 31 (-18!). And that's the four medium-sized parties, no large parties.

For the smaller parties, the Greens are a clear winner at 20 seats (+5), Left Alliance 17 (+5) and Swedish People's Party 10 (+1), Christian Democrats 6 (+1) and ""others"" 2 (+1). Others are the province of Åland (typically joins the Swedish Group) and businessman Harry Harkimo, who's running as an independent.

The Blue Future, which split from Finns Party, does not seem to be able to get a single representative.

So, clear winners would be SDP, Greens and Left Alliance, who probably would prefer to join a coalition, but they don't have enough representatives to rule without additional parties. The clear loser is Centre, which might lose more seats than most parties have in total.",Finland,/r/europe/comments/bd1og1/finnish_parliamentary_election_2019_its_polling/ekvup18/,avataRJ,1555264531

5323,"Biased study because you say so, even though I proved you wrong, and this is an organisation lobbying for wind generating capacity, true, but I never hid it, it’s written in big letters right in the link. And while it is lobbying for wind generating capacity, the data this analysis is based on is public, everyone can see it and make their own conclusions. I looked at the data and made my conclusion, which is compatible to the conclusion WindEurope themselves made.

You even say “I’m not the only one saying it” as if somehow that validates your statement, for whatever reason. You think that just because someone else agrees with you then you’re right? Laughable. Come back when you can show me the price of a nuclear power plant in the West that is reasonable, lower than that of most renewables, and a nuclear power plant that has been built on time and on budget in the West in the last 20 years. 

Even China, in its gigantic expansion of electricity generation, is building so much more renewables than nuclear. It’s not like everyone on the planet is stupid, apart from you genius nuclear shills. If most financial institutions, most countries, most publications, most studies, most businesses, most funds,  and most people all prefer renewables, maybe there is a reason for it. And it’s not because we’re all blinded by propaganda and you are the true seers, the true believers. In fact quite the opposite. I’m not even against nuclear per se, I simply see the economic data and accept that nuclear has no chance of competing with renewables, and so do most people that have or manage money. And you can bet that they have looked, they have analysed the investment value of new nuclear very deeply. If then money is still not pouring in the nuclear industry, it’s because there’s no good reason to invest in it. And that’s ignoring the absolute incompetence that the nuclear industry itself has demonstrated even in those few cases where someone was brave (or stupid) enough to offer them money and contracts to build new nuclear generating capacity in the last 20 years. Westinghouse in the US is a total fucking disaster, EDF and Areva in France are barely holding on thanks to massive state support, while also being incompetent in building Flamanville in France, Olkiluoto in Finland, and now Hinkley Point C in the UK. Toshiba had to sell is entire memory business just to escape bankruptcy caused by its nuclear business. 

Maybe someday, when the nuclear industry proves it’s no longer incompetent, and that it can compete with renewables, more money will be invested in the industry again.

&gt;General Jacob H. Smith's infamous order ""KILL EVERYONE OVER TEN"" was the caption in the New York Journal cartoon on May 5, 1902. The Old Glory draped an American shield on which a vulture replaced the bald eagle. The bottom caption exclaimed, ""Criminals Because They Were Born Ten Years Before We Took the Philippines.""
""I want no prisoners. I wish you to kill and burn, the more you kill and burn the better it will please me. I want all persons killed who are capable of bearing arms in actual hostilities against the United States.” General Jacob H. Smith said.

&gt;Since it was a popular belief among the Americans serving in the Philippines that native males were born with bolos in their hands, Major Littleton ""Tony"" Waller asked ""I would like to know the limit of age to respect, sir?.""

&gt;""Ten years,"" General Jacob H. Smith said.

Especially the lack of roof on the upper balconies makes it feel airy as if there is no roof at all on the building. Though I do not see boxes as a bad thing, I don't see this building as boxes, since there are walls separating the balconies and the top balconies have no ceiling, the lower balconies are terraced further than the upper balconies. 

I just generally like white buildings. IMO a lot of buildings would look much better if they were pure white. And I like minimalism. For example [this building](https://www.rako.cz/variant/hlavicka/o-nas/reference/vila-tugendhat-brno/s_vila-tugendhat_16_exterier_06_1600x800.jpg) is great too.

&gt;To me they look more like human garages, small featureless boxes for exchangeable units of labor to go and sleep in after their shift is over. 

It it interesting that the approach at those buildings was actually very different. They are indeed buildings for labor for Sunila pulp factory workers, built in the 30's, but during that time, factory areas often were villages. Think of Fiskars industrial area, or Anjala industrial areas. These areas were built by factory owners to have schools, shops, homes, gardens and such and the factory owners encouraged free time activities. It was far more progressive than what corporations do today.

Likewise in Sunila those buildings were not built as human garages, but the area was consciously built as a small thriving community. The factory owner had a villa there too.

Before those functionalistic buildings workers often lived in dark rooms with small windows and no running water. The leap to buildings with running water, huge windows, your own balcony and modern facilities was a great improvement to the condition of the workers.",Finland,/r/europe/comments/bcs0oq/ugly_industrial_western_helsinki_1987/ekvl4sg/,Toby_Forrester,1555257571

For example the main French fighter aircraft engine manufacturer, Safran, has never been given funding to create a military jet engine capable of thrust vectoring or supercruise. You are now asking them to mass produce an engine incorporating technologies they don't know, along with new 6th gen technologies,which have not been developed, in a reliable mass produced engine design which needs to be done by 2025 for a plane to fly 2030...that's a tall order.

And you already have a list of nuclear certified aircraft for the B61 nuclear bombs which were built in 1968. The US is currently creating a whole new line of nuclear bombs so we are very much done with this era of technology.

5657,"For those interested in the Spanish case:

There is a bunch of reasons to have this population distribution:

* Geography: Spain is very mountainous. This brings two problems:
   * It is difficult to have a good infraestructure to connect with other parts of the country.
   * It is difficult to create a city and quite unconfortable for its population (hill up, hill down)
* Wheather: Country side Spain has a very dry wheather which makes days quite hot and nights quite cold. If you apply to this, seasons, you have like 40 celsius / 105 Fahrenheit on normal summer days and -10 celsius/ 15 Fahrenheit very often in winter (average, you can have hotter or colder days).
* City amenities: This is cycle, the less population, the less amenities. So say goodbye to cinemas, malls, hospitals, schools.... (anyway in Spain Hospitals and schools are not quite far usually)
* Franco's industrial distribution: The dictator concentrated the industry in Catalonia and Basque country, people tend to go where they can find jobs, so if you live in a tiny town in the middle of Extremadura you are a little fucked. Coast has an economy driven on tourism and agriculture but for the country side this is difficult.
* Age range: Every city in Spain has university and tons of highschools with vocational training, etc. This means young people spend a good amount of their late teens and early 20s there, they usually fall in love, find a job, ghet married, etc (so bye bye hometown)

5791,"&gt;reducing property cost and natural preservation. 

Urban sprawl accommodates neither of these things. 

The costs on infrastructure alone are mind-boggling. [It’s estimated that urban sprawl costs the US around 1 trillion dollars per year](https://newclimateeconomy.net/content/release-urban-sprawl-costs-us-economy-more-1-trillion-year), and Australian cities are just as if not more sprawled than their American counterparts (American urban planners were actually brought over after the war so that Australia could model their growing cities on U.S. ones). 

So when people like Scott Morrison (ugh) blame infrastructure problems on ‘migrants’, the real problem lies with the fact that Australian infrastructure is stretched incredibly thin by the sheer size of the cities there (obviously larger cities = more/longer roads, rail lines, sewage tunnels, power lines etc.). Surprise surprise, [American faces the same problem](https://www.enotrans.org/article/americas-infrastructure-crisis-isnt-overstated/). 

Urban sprawl also has disastrous environmental effects. Very little of the ‘nature’ it ‘preserves’ is actually substantial enough to support any real form of local ecosystem (most of it is a patch of grass in people’s back yard, especially in newer developments) and it gobbles up land voraciously. Concreting of ground surfaces and the absorption of natural flood plains/water storage reservoirs also [increases the frequency and severity of flooding events](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/02/flood-waters-rising-urban-development-climate-change). Those living in single family homes (i.e. the majority of Australians) spend more on utilities than their urban counterparts (mainly because these houses are unnecessarily large despite a falling birth rate) and, as I mentioned before, sprawl facilitates auto-dependency (which is bad for the environment) and often makes efficient public transport costly and difficult to maintain (back to Australia’s infrastructure problem and the constant bitching in the media about how trains in Sydney in Melbourne are shit and seemingly have constant problems). 

I won’t even get into the numerous studies done on the positive economic affect of walkable, pedestrian friendly communities (hint: sprawled cities aren’t walkable or kind to pedestrians). Actually, I’ll just leave this little [article](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/walkable-cities-are-better-for-our-health-and-economy/article36384880/). And while we’re back on the economy, I’ll try [this](https://www.wri.org/blog/2018/11/cities-can-save-17-trillion-preventing-urban-sprawl) your way as well. 

Urban sprawl is inefficient as fuck and the perceived benefits are far outweighed by the negatives. Hence why I noticed Australians seem to whinge a lot about the tower blocks going up in their suburbs — it’s almost like this is happening for a reason. Hmmm why might sprawled cities be attempting to reconsolidate the urbanity they often destroyed after WWII? Oh yeah, because urban sprawl has been a disaster that urban planners everywhere are desperately trying to reverse.",,/r/europe/comments/bcnt4n/warsaw_is_a_green_city/ekux49w/,Viva_Straya,1555228484

And, moreover, Judge Leonie Brinkema reserves all national security cases for herself, and she’s a hanging judge. I never stood a chance from the very beginning.

I don't think he's being unreasonable to fear he won't get a fair trial. I've read the indictment, from what I can work out they are prosecuting him for attempting and failing to brute force a password hash provided by Manning, based on some old chat logs, without evidence that it actually was Assange, under the overly broad [CFAA](https://www.eff.org/issues/cfaa). Regardless, it's blatantly obvious that the real purpose is retribution for exposing US crimes, and to deter other whistleblowers by showing how far the US' reach is.",,/r/europe/comments/bck04c/whatever_you_think_of_julian_assange_his/ekuxaxz/,mutley89,1555228785

Look at 5:10 and 11:00 in the video - people have to sit on the floor, because instead of seating they built a jewelry store.

5825,"&gt; Spain is finally getting their solid far-right party too in a few weeks. Around 10% of the vote is expected for them. And that's because the press has been giving them aaaall the publicity —they bring spectacle to TV, and online they generate hate, which generates clicks and benefits.

I saw a comment on Twitter comparing the media coverage of Vox to Trump in the 2016 US election. There’s a lot of truth in that.

However, I feel that there are lots of people who prepared the groundwork for Vox, just as there were for Trump. The right-wing in Spain (or at least the PP) has never really been able to condemn the dictatorship which allows a lot of space for serious intolerance. It also manifested itself in how they would rather avoid or not finance efforts to deal with the legacy of the dictatorship (while occasionally financing the Francisco Franco institute). 

The left-wing, or especially the PSOE, also has a role in this for having gone along with the compromise of 1978 rather than fighting for justice for the victims of Fascism.",Éire,/r/europe/comments/bcte2y/neus_català_the_only_living_catalan_survivor_of/ekuxnuq/,gamberro,1555229376

5828,"&gt; These were not routine political gatherings but demonstrations aimed at rewriting the history of the Holocaust 

No, no they werent. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Ostensibly, the protests were directed against [Senate Bill 447](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/447), the so-called Justice for Uncompensated Survivors Today (Just) Act, signed into law by President Trump in May 2018, which provides congressional oversight over restitution of Jewish property stolen in the Holocaust. 

That is such a misleading explanation of the bill. 

&gt;Polish national identity is intimately tied to the narrative of Polish victimhood in World War II  

Hmmm, I wonder why... could it have anything to do what happened to Poland during and after WWII?

&gt; suggest a larger network behind them that both affirms and informs the coordinated efforts to expunge the historical record of Polish participation in the Holocaust. 

Something to back up this claim? No? Shocking!

5963,"Agreed. For all the talks on values and moral authority, it never really benefitted the EU, and made it look as a naive kid in a world of *realpolitik*. In Serbia's situation, turning against Vucic wouldn't help the present, and wouldn't secure the future either, as the country is still mostly pro-Russian, anti-NATO, and very unlikely to shift to a real democracy even if Vucic were to disappear today, with free elections to happen.

If anything, the EU is gaining strength in Serbia, help the country to follow their standards, and appear as a political ally. Should Serbians hold this against the EU, hen they are likely to not want to join either, and EU's influence would be lost anyway.",France,/r/europe/comments/bcqlf5/people_of_serbia_are_out_in_the_streets_of/ekuug93/,AchaiusAuxilius,1555224419

5965,"They build the castle first to watch for invaders coming into the Forth. You can see for miles from the top of Castle Rock. And with the castle, the king came from across the Forth from Fife to live in the castle. Then the people came, made Edinburgh the new capital. And the city grew along the caig.

But Edinburgh was still vulabate from invasion from the north (Norse man, Highlanders etc) and the English to the south. So a strong, mighty wall had to be build (parts of this wall, Flodden, is still dotted around the Old Town.) And the Nor' Loch. A loch which was removed in the 1700s during the building of the New Town and is now where Waverley Train Station and Princes Street Gardens are today. (Where this photo is taken, looking up to Cockburn Street, with the High Street beyond. The building on Market Street are also in the photo.)

As the city couldn't grow outwards due to the wall, it had to grow upwards and below. The building grew many floors up while many floors were added below.

Does this answer your question? It's also answers how the photo has many layers of buildings to it. (We are taught this in Primary school in Edinburgh.)",,/r/europe/comments/bcstmg/edinburgh_scotland/ekuuhsc/,AlDu14,1555224481

The recipe varies a little depending on the country but it's generally the same. First you get yourself a nice shot glass to limit yourself (Warning: If step not followed side effects may include nausea, passing out, a lot of fun with friends, and death in rare cases.) Two: Get a big bottle of rakija, enough to share. Three: Remove the cap, and let your inner Balkaner take over. Four: Wake up and swear to never let yourself do this again.

McDonald's, Burger King, Pizza Hut and KFC do have European subsidiaries, but that doesn't really make them ""European companies"".  


There's also the reality of the massive cultural influence going on. I'm not that old, mid-30's, but when I grew up Halloween was not something that was celebrated here, by now it's more famous and well known to the kids than the local version of it.
