9,"&gt; Isn't it time to rethink the societal benefits of higher education when it leads to a deficit in vocational workers? 

No.

If anything, you could advocate for the education to be made even harder and more demanding with higher grade standards to admitting new students. But even that is pointless. The fact is, with free education, more equality and technology like internet, higher education just isn't that hard to obtain and it's nothing special - a big chunk of humanity has always been capable of it and now it just became more available. There's nothing bad about it.

Even today I feel like education systems still put pointless obstacles towards students.

But making higher education more elitist and wealth-based is just nothing but stupid and it's a fucking monarchists and capitalists wet dream. Why would I limit my possibilities, to get an industrial job with less money that may be taken over by robots anytime? Also limiting access to education is a great way to limit progress and stop innovation. So many great minds would end up doing something under their capabilities.

Yes. The discussion is over. Europe is not backing US sanctions and Turkey and Russia have been helping Iran circumvent US sanctions for a decade already. Soon they'll declare a nuclear power.   
   
&gt;Nuclear weapons only have a detterent value if countries are willing to use them. Do you really want to give everybody the right to develop and deploy nuclear weapons? Really?   
   
Yes, either they all have it or none of them have it. Who are you to decide who may have it or not, are you a divine authority? US had it and already used it a few times on several occasions.    
    
&gt;Finally nuclear weapons are generally an ultimate guarantee against existential and threats. What existential threat does Iran face? Any threat against Iran would enflame the Middle-East. Iran doesn't need nuclear weapons to guarantee its future.   
   
Iran faces threats from both Israel and US (both nuclear powers) and now US is giving Saudi Arabia nuclear technology. What existential threat did the US face when they nuked Japan and used tactical nukes and depleted uranium in Iraq and Afghanistan?   
   
So anyway, the West has no divine authority to decide who MAY have it and who MAY NOT. If they have it, so can Iran (and Turkey will also soon have just after Iran).",,/r/europe/comments/hcold6/european_powers_refuse_to_back_us_sanctions_on/fvj1uhq/,amateurfighter,1592737746

The Penza Gubernia was critical in providing food to the cities and the government used effective measures, such as prodrazvyorstka (forcible requisitioning), to collect grain from the kulaks.

hundreds of thousands of lives were to be lost had kulaks gotten their way.

From the Adriatic to the Black Sea, the story of the demographic death spiral is the same: people are ageing in countries that need more coffins than cots. People are emigrating, no one is immigrating and the result is falling populations.

And then there is Slovenia.

At the beginning of 2020, according to Slovenia’s Statistical Office, its population was 2,096,000, an increase of almost 15,000 on the year before.

At independence in 1991, Slovenia’s population was some two million, so by 2020 its population was almost five per cent higher.

These figures make Slovenia an outlier. It is one of only a few of the former communist countries in Europe whose population is increasing and which has more people today than it had three decades ago.

With looming future pension and social care commitments, planners in every European country want their populations to grow, but in Slovenia they are far from popping the champagne corks.

Slovenia’s headline news of increasing population masks serious underlying demographic problems.

Like all other Europeans, Slovenes are ageing. Life expectancy is 81.5 years, which is a little higher than the EU average. It is also the highest of any former communist country in Europe. Life expectancy in neighbouring Croatia, for example, lags far behind at 78.2 years.

More Slovenes die than are born — precisely 900 more in 2018 — and although the fertility rate of Slovene women has increased to 1.62 in recent years, higher than the EU average of 1.55, that is way below the 2.1 figure needed for a population to replace itself.

However, Slovenia’s increasing fertility rate does not mean that more babies are being born. It simply means that the rate is going up because the number of women of reproductive age against which it is calculated is going down.

The main reason Slovenia’s population is increasing, then, is that, at least until coronavirus hit, labour shortages meant the country was importing as many workers from abroad as it could get.

At the same time, in 2019 the number of resident Slovene citizens fell by some 3,200 while the number of foreigners increased by nearly 18,200, meaning that 7.5 per cent of people in Slovenia are foreigners.

Of those, 86.4 per cent come from the rest of former Yugoslavia, of which 54 per cent are Bosnians.

In 2018, the last year for which this data is available, 28,455 immigrated to Slovenia, including some 4,300 citizens returning home, while 13,527 left the country, just under half of whom were Slovenes. This means that 14,928 more immigrated than emigrated.

Without this net immigration, the country’s population would be falling.

If you look at Slovenia’s population for the past three decades, the total fluctuates in an unusual way in the 1990s, but this oddity had as much to do with changes in the way people were counted as anything else.

For example, thousands of former Yugoslavs who had not taken citizenship or registered as foreigners at independence were “erased” from the population total, only later to be restored.

In fact, the country’s population has remained remarkably stable around the two million mark but has increased in recent years thanks to immigration.

In most other countries it is difficult to know how many have emigrated. Slovenia, however, has much better data than most because it counts its people via a population register and obliges everyone to register their residence and to deregister if they go abroad.

While this still leaves room for a margin of error, including a grey zone for foreign workers such as Bosnians registered as resident but actually “posted” to Germany or elsewhere in the EU, Danilo Dolenc, the head of Demography Statistics at Slovenia’s Statistical Office, said: “We know that over-registration is a fact and therefore we have an overestimation of the population, but it is less than one per cent.”

The critical issue, according to Alenka Kajzer of the Institute of Macroeconomic Analysis and Development (IMAD), is that while the total population number has been more or less stable, its structure has not been. The number of people who are aged 65 and above “is increasing sharply”.

In 1990, this segment of the population represented 10.6 per cent of the total but since then it has almost doubled to almost 19 per cent, and Kajzer said it is projected to swell to about a quarter by 2030.

At the same time, the working age population (between 20 and 64) has been shrinking, especially since 2012.

All of Europe is ageing so in this respect Slovenia is not an outlier. Today its share of people aged 65 and over is less than the EU average but Kajzer said that is set to change.

In one or two decades, the country will have an elderly share much higher than the EU average, meaning that it will be faced with one of Europe’s “biggest increases in age-related expenditures” such as pensions and social care. And this, she said, “is not just due to demographic changes, but to the fact that our social security system is not adapted to the new demographic situation”.

In 2016, an IMAD report noted that, on current projections, age-related public expenditure would reach a third of gross domestic product by 2060, which would be among the highest in the EU. It also said the pension system was “already unsustainable” and that the country had “no comprehensive system for long-term care”.


IN 2017, IMAD participated in drawing up a strategy to cope with Slovenia’s ageing population. It noted that expenditure on pensions was set to “increase at the fastest rate among all EU countries” and that given their relatively low level, the poverty rate amongst pensioners threatened “to become more acute”.

“Unfortunately,” said Kajzer, no changes have yet been enacted to tackle the coming crisis and “broad action plans” are “still in preparation”.

According to Damir Josipovic of the Institute of Ethnic Studies, Slovenia’s looming demographic problems are made worse by the fact that successive governments have attempted to deal with them with two major schemes incorporating elements of social engineering.

One is that, as a result of trying to get more young people into work, some 300,000 people who are younger than 65, many in their 50s, are already retired. He said this means Slovenia’s pension system is already creaking under a “huge burden”.

The second problem, he said, is that in the wake of independence, governments sponsored a huge expansion in higher education. Today the consequences of this are that while Slovenes are well educated there are not enough of them able or prepared to work in, say, construction or manufacturing.

There are also too many well educated graduates for not enough jobs requiring their skills, so some accept work below their qualifications, meaning a loss of human capital.

However, while the number of working-age Slovenes is contracting naturally, the comparative shortage of jobs for those with higher education is also a major factor behind their seeking jobs abroad.

At the same time, some of those jobs are being filled by immigrants; being in the same predicament at home, they are taking them even though they may be below their status too.

This, said Mirjam Milharcic Hladnik of the Slovene Migration Institute, has led to the evolution of stereotypes — that it is well educated Slovenes emigrating and poorly educated Bosnians, Macedonians and others “coming to Slovenia to build roads”.

In fact, the data of the last few years shows that the educational background of immigrants and Slovene emigrants “is very similar”.

The number of immigrants and emigrants, however, is correlated with the performance of the economy, so in the years 2010-17, more or less the same numbers of people came to Slovenia as left it. In 2018, when the economy had finally recovered from the crash of 2008, the numbers of immigrants soared.

Today it is far from clear how long the legacy of coronavirus will last but it seems inevitable that a shrinking economy will again lead to a declining number of immigrants. Kajzer said anecdotal evidence suggests “a lot” of foreign workers had already gone home as the lockdown began.

In the coming years, then, governments will be faced with a race against time. By 2025, the largest baby-boomer generations, born in the wake of World War II, start turning 80. So governments will be rushing to plug the gap between the demands of increasing numbers of pensioners and their bills for social care, all the while trying to pay for them out of the taxes of a shrinking labour force.

Differing projections predict that by 2050, unlike all the other countries of former Yugoslavia and almost all of those of former communist Europe, Slovenia’s population will not fall dramatically. It will either be a little higher or still hovering at around two million.

What will be the same, though, is that Slovenes will just be a lot older.",🇸🇮/🇭🇷,/r/europe/comments/hd3rf6/slovenias_rising_population_belies_demographic/fviur2a/,CrystalMaterelius,1592730341

Fessenheim was shut down purely for political reasons, technically and economically that plant could continue for decades. But it became the victim of a symbolic political choice, sadly.

Risk doesn't equal danger, every single powerplant in the world has flooding risks, seismic risk etc. But depending on how those risks are managed risk doesn't equate danger. We all know the French safety authority takes this very seriously after the well known Blayais accident 20 years ago. Today if they aren't convinced the risk is low enough they shut the plant down. See Tricastin for example.

&gt; [In reply to: Our view on what we are has always changed] Our biology and natural drives has not. They are the foundation of our actions and our views, that is what I refer to when I say human nature. 

Are simply false and not ""objective"". Our views on biology and natural drives has changed dozens and dozens of times. Less than a hundred years ago a ton of people believed in different ""types"" or ""races"" of humans, all with different natures. 

Or alternatively, look at the sexuality of women. In antiquity it was assumed that women needed to orgasm in order to become pregnant, which was supplanted based on supposedly scientific evidence, that women can't even feel sexual pleasure. Only in the last decades with women's liberation the whole idea that women can have sexual pleasure (and that it's worthy to strive for) reemerged - including a change of the view of women as objects. Today's topic being a battle between a mechanical and a mental view of how women achieve pleasure, though both highly controversial.

If we can't even get something as simple as sexuality, which is an essential part of human nature, somewhat right and if it changed so much even in the last 100 years, how can we be certain of any of our current views on ""human nature""? Or with racial theories, some still being prevalent today. Or the wholly different views in different parts of the world - mainly the more individualist views in the west vs collectivist views in Asia.

187,"Anyone who (like I) have been in Norway knows what pride they take in their agriculture, which due to its geographical location is and always has been uncompetitive. So historically Norwegians starved when harvest failed in countries where Norway used to import from. So protectionism is bad for consumer. That we can agree on, but because of the historical context the Norwegians do not care, and will subsidise.

Wages are higher in Norway mainly due to oil discovery (they did not increase past Sweden or Denmark until after oil was discovered in the 1960's, and before that they were always behind its more populous neighbors with better agriculture and landscape that did not require blowing away half a mountain to build a house.

So oil caused inflation. Inflation caused wages and products to increase. The boost in technology and very expensive and complicated infrastructure solutions also helped wages grow, but the added inflation from the oil is not directly comparable to inflation because of the Norwegian oil fund. They took the oil profit away from the nation, and invested it in other countries. So that is why per capita purchasing power parity in Norway has a lot to with oil and inflation.
Withou all that money, there would not exist many settlements on the Norwegian West Coast. It is difficult terrain, harsh weather and very challenging to develop, and yet you see million dollar villages isolated in weird locations and expensive boats in private harbors. 

I will happily repeat greedy EU beggers. Follow the EU budget and recovery fund negotiations, and the greedy EU countries are in heated debates trying to secure as much of the money as possible without the net contributors even accepting the expense.

The issue with them is that Rottweiler were breed for purpose. They started as a sherpard dog and became guards due to their nature of being very loyal and precise with commands. The trouble with that is that a Rottweiler needs a owner who can provide the dog with the knowledge of what it needs to value and they need to do it well.

Last year a family I know from my home village got themselves a Rottweiler and literally everyone I know said it was a bad idea, including my aunt as a dog lover. Fastforwards a bit and it turns out to be that way. The dad of the house works as a craftsman so general out of the house most of the time, leaving the dog to be trained by the mother who said herself was intimidated by the dog. The dog then proceed to place itself above their daughter which led to it at first only growling at the girl and by the end of it the dog bit her in the hand and was put to sleep.

246,"&gt; He forgot to mention that the USSR invaded Poland as part of the agreement with the Naxis...

First, there was no Poland before WW1 and Russia's civil war for many years. Then during Russia's civil war, Poland declared independence and just like Finland grabbed all kinds of territories from the Russian Empire that probably the likes of Stalin thought was theirs.

Second, before WW2, there was a Munich agreement, during which many western nations, including Germany and Poland discussed the partition of Czechoslovakia. USSR wasn't invited and was on the side o Czechoslovakia. Meanwhile Poland grabbed a piece of the Czechoslovakian pie along with Germany. Then got a taste of its own medicine.

Third, if USSR wouldn't take some of those Polish territories (none of which are now part of Russia, btw), it would have been in the hands of Nazis, and the Nazis would have been even closer to Russia before their invasion of USSR.

Fourth, USSR gave Poland huge chunks of German territories after WW2. USSR could have easily annexed those German territories. Hell, USSR could have easily annexed the whole Poland and did what the Nazis planned all along (expel some and enslave others), but it didn't.

Consequently, the Romanian government ""withdrew"" from Bessarabia and Bukovina after a Soviet ultimatum, and a net gain of about 100000 people was recorded in Bessarabia, many of whom were Jews fleeing the *official state doctrine* of anti-Semitism in Romania at the time. 

As a response to the totally devastating loss of ancestral land that had been Romanian for a bit over 20 years, Romania went from officially ""neutral"" monarchy to a fascist member of the Axis under the war criminal Antonescu within a year under threat of an uprising of the primarily fascist or national conservative population, promptly elevated the anti-Semitic ""Jewish Bolshevism"" conspiracy theory to doctrine, adopted the Nuremberg laws, invaded Bessarabia, pushed further into the SU proper, and happily deported almost the entire remaining (i.e. not having fled or having been killed by the Einsatzgruppen and Romanian death squads) Jewish population of Romania, as well as the newly occupied Soviet territories,  to Nazi concentration camps, ghettos, and labor camps.

Romania was an enthusiastic participant in the Axis, with a long anti-Semitic history, one of the worst perpetrators of the Holocaust after Germany and Austria, pushed into traditionally not Romanian territory twice (during the Russian Revolution and again in WW2) in pursuit of a ""greater Romania"", and was certainly *not* compelled to do anything by Soviet aggression.

Leftist, or correctly far left socialist views needs uneducated, stated failed individuals to foster the sentiment of inequality.

Europe has seen how Communism will destroy the inner soul of entire generations, that's why most of European countries have embraced a lot of socialist systems into their governance so even the poorest of their countryman have a system to fall onto and for those in EU the regulations have brought even more stability, by slowly improving the standard of living.

The fight is over who has the best system, now we fight for how to better balance what we have and improve it, over how to temper capitalism but not to gag it, how to keep a the open market open, but still hold not letting it ram free by cutting corners because for short term financial gain, that will hurt all of us on the long term, etc. 

The present is showing us that even the MOST LIBERAL societies, parties or governments, in face of economic fallout, they will take socialist measures.

And Hong Kong *is* a part of China and it *was* separated from it by the British Empire, so frankly we have no right to tell them what to do as it is entirely an internal affair.

Taiwan is a different matter in my opinion since it has never been ruled by the CCP and is de facto a different country with most of its citizens not even identifying as Chinese anymore. But even there we must accept that it will probably eventually become a part of the PRC by force and that there is not much we can do about it. So many people disdain the concept of America being the ""world police"", but at the same time they seem to want the EU try to be some kind of world police force that will protect *our* values in other peoples' countries.

560,"Right. That's the reason. /S

I need you to understand just how wrong you are. There's layers to it. 

First, even if embargos were the only problem stopping trade between post war Lithuania and the west, then my point still stands. By being forced to become part of the USSR, Lithuania was forced to be on the losing part of the embargo. Had they stayed  Independent as a nation, they could've stayed neutral, could've joined the West as a trade partner, or could've willingly sided with the USSR. At that point, it's their choice and their consequences.

Here's where it gets complicated. Being under various embargos wasn't the only consequence of being forcefully joined to the USSR.

When you trade, you have to have something TO trade. Since what you need isn't always sold by someone who needs what you have ...

( imagine this, you have chickens, and you need bricks. There are several brick makers in town. Only one of them needs chickens. That will be the guy you buy from, unless you figure out what the other brick makers would trade for. This is a barter system) 

... It's easier to trade currency for something. Before the war, Lithuania had a stable, hard currency. Freely exchangeable for other hard currencies. It was even more stable since this wasn't fiat currency, this was on the gold standard. Even if the seller didn't want that currency (the litas) you were free to trade it into dollars, pounds, or whatever else you needed.

Then came the USSR. The litas was first devalued, then taken out of circulation and replaced by the Soviet Ruble. This was not a hard currency. As far as carrying value, the Soviet currency was closer to Disney dollars than American dollars. This is because just like the USSR, Disney World is also a land of make-believe. What you can buy with the currency, and how much of it can be purchase is decided by management. Arbitrarily. It's also very hard to purchase something like a car, or an apartment with a currency like that. I imagine that getting a car purchased with Disney dollars is about as much of a pain as buying a car with rubles in Moscow in 1952. You don't just get the vehicle, you gotta know someone and pull some strings to make it happen.

This is why nobody from outside of the USSR sphere of influence wanted to trade in their ""currency"". This brings up back to bartering. What was manufactured in the Eastern Block was often so low quality that it had to be sold to the outside world for pennies on the dollar. Otherwise no one wanted the product. I'm pretty sure that the only mass manufactured product coming out of the USSR that was without a doubt the best in the world was firearms.

Say that you managed to sell something on the free market. What did you get on return? Hard currency? Raw material? Manufactured goods? The Soviets didn't believe in intellectual property so they didn't pay for that unless absolutely necessary. 

No matter what you received, and how deep your ties to the Eastern Block, a lot of what came in headed straight for Moscow. 

There is an old Polish joke about a conversation between a ship captain (sc) and border patrol (bp)

Bp - where are you heading?
Sc - to the soviet union
Bp - What is your cargo?
Sc - we're delivering coal
Bp - and on your way back home!
Sc - I'll be taking the train, they're taking the ship too

The Soviet Union wasn't helping the countries in it's sphere of influence, so much as it was strip mining it's newly conquered lands. Like a parasite. Did it give some back? Sure. Did it finance some construction projects in places like Lithuania, Albania, and even as far as Cuba? Sure. The net effect for countries that ended up East of the iron curtain after WW2 was always a loss.

 Kristian used to work with this accountant as a previous company years prior, and over the years many anecdotes were shared over pitches and pints.  You have not formally met Phil, but you already think you know him.

He is probably gay. Which is why he stayed with his wife even though she cheated on him multiple times. It is probably why he is so awkward, timid, and non-confrontational as well. Even walking into a room of unfamiliar faces, his body was almost ready to coil in preparation of incoming blows. 

I examined his face for the little cuts and swelling that Kristian spoke of but could not see any. Then I chuckled at the thought of him wearing cover up. He was known to do that, evidenced by a funny story Kristian told me last evening. 

After he formally introduced himself to the room he sat down next to me and made a joke. I don't know what he said but what he meant by it was ""Im a nice guy, I am not a threat to you"".

770,"&gt; You had the rights, but Albanians were already pushing for independence much earlier. You see, I advocated for a land swap, you are just assuming I want to reintegrate everything. But as followed, the Serbs of RS should be allowed to separate and the status of Serbs in neighboring countries be secured.

&gt; Kosovo is a pseudo-state and the support for a merge with Albania stands way above 50/50. But as you yourself say, it is political suicide, not in Serbia, but globally if Kosovo unites with Albania. Because then it would show the world the US bombing a sovereign country to simply transfer land.

So let me get this straight. Kosovo is a pseudo-state which has no right to exist, but a land swap with Serbia will make it exist? That makes no fucking sense.

And from your own source, all I read throughout the 20th century was Serbia trying to colonize Kosovo. “ For 1918 to 1921, Sabrina Ramet cites the estimate that the expulsions of Albanians reduced their numbers from around 800,000 – 1,000,000 within Kosovo down to some 439,500.”

Anyway, I read the whole thing and didnt see a single mention of this supposed mass migration (which was for some reason never shown by the Yugoslav media).

It’s not some grand conspiracy. Between 1961-1981, Kosovo averaged about 30k more births than deaths per year (meaning Albanians gave a lot of birth, and medicine vastly improved). 30k per year over 20 years equals 600k increase in population. There you go, that’s how easy it is to explain this.

Honestly, do us both a favor and read the page you linked. All it shows is colonization and mass deportation of Albanians throughout the 20th century.",,/r/europe/comments/hcin4z/slavic_countries_which_have_pan_slavic_colours_on/fvh5tt0/,ITsLoverBoy,1592687859

BZZZT WRONG!

The Tsarists destabilised the provisional government by trying to overthrow it, their attempted coup had direct support from the UK, both diplomatically and directly, in the form of British troops (wearing Russian uniforms) and armoured vehicles.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kornilov_affair

&gt; That's who you support.

He was absolutely correct.

&gt; "" food requisitioning, combined with the effects of seven years of war and a severe drought, contributed to a famine that caused between 3 and 10 million deaths.

I kinda feel like the ""seven years of war"" part is probably the key contributor to that, but what do I know? I guess those farmers would have all continued working in the midst of a civil war if the government had allowed them to sell their grain at market prices, right?

Soviet economic policy wasn't even a secondary cause of the famine.

&gt; This famine killed an estimated 5 million people, primarily affecting the Volga and Ural River regions, and peasants resorted to cannibalism. The famine resulted from the combined effects of economic disturbance because of the Russian Revolution and Russian Civil War, exacerbated by rail systems that could not distribute food efficiently.
&gt;
&gt; One of Russia's intermittent droughts in 1921 aggravated the situation to a national catastrophe. Hunger was so severe that it was likely seed-grain would be eaten rather than sown. At one point relief agencies had to give food to railroad staff to get their supplies moved.

810,"1) Take it up with prof. Roger Griffin if you don't like this definition. All I will say is that you seem to be mixing nationalism with ultranationalism. The latter isn't just ""nationalism, except I'm a big bad lefty so I'll stick 'ultra' at the front so that it seems especially bad"". Ultranationalism is nationalism (the ideology promoting the interests of a particualar nation above all others) taken to it's most extreme, where it becomes a form of bigotry and hatred. I believe that word was used in that definition very purposefully.

2) Nazis did not abolish private property. In fact they were allying themselves with the capitalists until they got hold of power. Rather, they wanted the entire economy to serve the interests of the state above all else, but the specifics of how this was done was a secondary concern. The idea of calling nazis any type of socialist is ridiculous and betrays a fundamental lack of understanding in regards to both concepts.

3) Stateless society and various ways of achieving it is a bigger topic that I'd rather not get into too deeply here.

Nope. There is an agreement between NATO and Russia. And between other countries too.

Finland and Sweden cannot join NATO according to that agreement. Same as Austria btw.

That agreement included Baltics too. But the agreement was violated by side of the US.

Finland and Sweden just have more political power to resist the US's influence.

834,"It is oil shale and we have a lot of it. Important to distinguish oil shale from tight oil (which is commonly known as shale oil). Oil shale is a mineral that is mined, and that mineral contains Kerogen. Tight oil or shale oil is liquid crude oil, that is trapped between layers of rock (shales).

Oil shale has been turned into oil for more than a century in Estonia. Basically you need to heat small oil shale fragmets and this causes the oils to evaporate. The gas is then cooled down and oil is condensed out from the gas. Oil from oil shale (called shale oil - yeah, the confusion continues) is mostly used in shipping, but also for heating. Historically shale oil was used in Submarines, as the oil is thicker than water and will not surface is the submarine is leaking (so as not to leave a visible trace on the water surface).

In 2019, Estonian companies produced around 1,1 million tons of shale oil, which is an all time high. 1,1 million tons is around 8 million barrels.

Historically Estonian oil shale has been prominently used for electricity generation and less for synthetic oil production. During the Soviet era, Estonian power production was seriously oversized. We had two major power plants (Balti Power Plant and Estonia Power plant), which combined had around 4 GW of generation capacity, Estonia only consumes on average 1GW. The excess was mainly used to power Leningrad Oblast and Leningrad (Petersburg) itself.

In independent Estonia the power production has been massively scaled down, while the theoretical capacity is still around 2GW, only around 1GW is kept in ready to work state depending on the market price.

And since oil production has been more profitable in the past few decades and also produces an order of magnitude less CO2 in production than electricity production, there has been a shift towards more oil production.",,/r/europe/comments/hcl9q3/largest_power_plant_by_european_country/fvgrz75/,sanderudam,1592680045

Kosovo is a multi ethnic state whose constitution guarantees minority rights. If the Serbs want to live in a Serbian state, there is Serbia. Serbia id not s multi ethnic state and doesn't represent minorities properly.


Besides, according to the ICJ, declaration of independence by self determination is legal if there was an undemocratic state commuting warcrimes upon a minority.

The Germans didn't ""smuggle"" him anywhere. Lenin travelled on an official train of the German Supreme Command, which used every diplomatic backchannel they had to arrange for his voyage into Russia, provided him with guards along the way and a hundred thousand marks in gold.

What do you mean? That Lenin's voyage was a conscious German design? Yes, we know that, because they put it all in writing and you can actually read the minutes yourself if you like; they're still in the archives. 

Or that Lenin was a German ""agent""? Well, there is no document that he personally signed and turned into an agent. But you *can* be an agent of a foreign power without thinking you are: By doing their bidding. Which is exactly what Lenin did.

Without the German Supreme Command, there wouldn't have been an October Revolution, and to that end, Lenin was a German tool that actually achieved much more than the Germans ever hoped for.

Am I mistaken?

I also don’t know if it’s fair to call it a change from Franco’s era. The current liberal constitutional monarchy would be seen as an abomination in Franco’s eyes. The monarchy has also been a Spanish institution for most of Spain’s history, it wasn’t just shit out by Franco. From a certain point of view, Republicanism is the historical aberration.

The last time Spain was a Republic, it was an extremely brief, undemocratic (rigged elections and political skullduggery left and right), and unstable disaster that led to the civil war and Franco gaining power in the first place.

He led the Russian people and the whole world out of the barbarism of World War I and was the first to make peace with Germany.

He was a highly educated man, lawyer, revolutionary, founder of the state.

And he always remained personally humble, considerate and considerate towards his colleagues and comrades, closely connected to the workers, the farmers, the common people.

1219,"&gt;As protests inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement swept across the UK, the Prime Minister condemned the violent removal of a statue of a slave owner, and portrayed the daubing of graffiti on a memorial to Winston Churchill an effort to ""photoshop the entire cultural landscape.""

What's he going to do? Say to people ""go ahead, start tearing shit down"" and start calling a national hero racist? Come on now.

&gt;After stating ""Black Lives Matter"" in a statement published in the afro-Caribbean newspaper the Voice, Johnson issued a series of tweets against the removal of statues, saying protests had been hijacked by extremists after a statue of Churchill, of whom Johnson wrote a widely panned biography, was defaced with the words ""was a racist.""

You can be both support some issues the Black Lives Matter movement raises, while condemning other things they do.

&gt;He continued to equate the anti-racism protesters with violence, and declaim the sanctity of the now boarded-up Churchill statue, in a Telegraph column on Sunday. He reserved one paragraph to condemn the ""patently racist"" far-right groups, who clashed with police officers last Saturday as they targeted Black Lives Matter demonstrations.

He literally opens with condemning those people. First sentence: ""It was utterly absurd that a load of far-Right thugs and bovver boys this weekend converged on London with a mission to protect the statue of Winston Churchill.""

Turkey took on the burdens the Ottomans had but in reality we are a hard reset on the Ottoman system. We Turks declared independence from the Ottomans just as much as you guys did. The noise of our Independence War against European Imperialists drowned out the fact there was a Civil Strife between the Ottoman and Turkish governments (there was a time when Turkey had 2 governments at same time, one from Istanbul and one from Ankara) and there's no strong reason but for historical luck as to why we never descended into Civil War ourselves with Pro-Ottoman and Pro-Turk factions (there were actually some small skirmishes of this nature at the time, but the focus on outside invaders and the hard work of the Turkish National Movement ensured the population remained largely united during the transition from Ottoman to Turkey).",Turkey,/r/europe/comments/hc0tlh/in_1850_city_with_largest_pop_of_bulgarians_was/fvfjnft/,Ephemeral-Throwaway,1592652414

1337,"And you pull that per capita thing out of your ass? Do you want me to post dozens of articles about racism towards Asians in the US?

For that Cornell blog you linked: she just went from a student town of 30,000 where she lived inside an Asian community to a major European capital of 3,7 millions inhabitants. Do you think she would have fared better in any town in the US?

She just had her first racist interactions in Germany so that's it, all the Germans are racist. 

She wants people in Germany to approach race like it is approached in the US. Just like if everybody already knew who she was, where she came from, etc. She even recognizes it in the end of the article: she realizes that she went from living in her Asian community in the US to living in a foreign country and understood that's why she hadn't faced racism earlier.

While half the points she raises is clearly racist (there's no disregarding it), the other half are not really racism but more interculturality issues. Asking about someone's origin might be impolite and done indelicately but it is not racist.

The problem with experiencing racism is that it taints everything. You could have spent 6 months without a problem and then have 1 racist interaction and all of a sudden, you question every interaction with that filter. The point I'm making is that racism is not organized from the top and enabled. It is an individual decision. Those who do it are cowards, because they target individuals who can not read the social cues, can not understand the lexicon because of the language barrier and can not retaliate because they do not know the legal mechanisms to deal with racism.

But if you point of the racist individual and say the whole country is responsible for this man's behaviour. Then you're wrong.

Also, finishing the article on a Godwin point was really what I expected, thanks for falling into the trap.

1371,"There is no real logic to it all. As with many of these things, it's about emotions. And not that people want to hang on to something racist - because they don't perceive it as such and the intent is not such.

I think the reaction of some mostly comes from a perceived feeling of their culture being under attack. And in the case of the Dutch, I must say - as a Dutchman myself - I find it hard to come up with the cultural things that are supposed to be uniquely Dutch. I guess a lot of bikes, a perceived idea of being tolerant, and some pride in being a small country punching above its weight in some areas is basically it. So when the single really Dutch holiday is then made out to be racist, people will rally around it and see this as a thing they can fight back on, while in other aspects of life they just have to roll with the changes and let it happen.

When the subject comes up, people focus on just the aspect of Zwarte Piet, but they don't see the surrounding elements that lead to the pushback against the criticism. Ironically, this is exactly the situation the other way around also, where the people being in favor of this character in this form don't see the complete picture and the point of view that leads other to see it as racist.",,/r/europe/comments/hciaq8/the_resolution_about_racism_can_this_be_the_end/fvfcdvl/,cissoniuss,1592644902

1432,"&gt; First of all, hts and al qaeda are not the same. Stop with that manipulation. If you dont know what you are talking about, you might as well shut up. And if there are criminals in hts, they are being dealt with.

They aren't exactly the same, they have changed names and organisation several times, through Nusra to HTS. Doesn't mean that they still aren't basically the same religious extremists that carry out religious terrorism and that Turkey arms and protects them.

&gt; Secondly I do not know how many times should I link this article but I will keep doing it until you understand. 

It doesn't matter how often you post an article from 2015. If you haven't also posted the 2017 article by the UN that debunks it then you are deliberately trying to manipulate or you don't know what you are talking about, which, funnily enough, is exactly what you accused me of, but without anything to back it up. That makes you a lot worse!

""backgrounds.

The United Nations Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic released a report in March 2017 in which it categorically rejected and entirely debunked any such claims as ethnic cleansing, forced displacement or discrimination based on race/sectarianism by the Kurds. The report states:

“Though allegations of “ethnic cleansing” continued to be received during the period under review, the Commission found no evidence to substantiate claims that YPG or SDF forces ever targeted Arab communities on the basis of ethnicity, nor that YPG cantonal authorities systematically sought to change the demographic composition of territories under their control through the commission of violations directed against any particular ethnic group (UN).”""

https://www.ohchr.org/_layouts/15/WopiFrame.aspx?sourcedoc=/Documents/Countries/SY/A_HRC_34_CRP.3_E.docx&amp;action=default&amp;DefaultItemOpen=1


&gt; Will you consider 4m syrians in turkey another ethnic cleansing and hold turkey responsible?

Of course Turkey is responsible: No other nation has done as much to intensify and lengthen the Syrian Civil War by arming, supplying, training and paying jihadis, trying to overthrow the Syrian government, standing by and allowing IS to do what it wanted for years without stepping in, only to use the excuse of fighting IS when the Kurds were getting close to defeating IS and connecting the cantons.

And those 4 million refugees are part of a problem that Turkey created and worsened, both in the case of having a Syrian Kurdish political and military organisation rise up, in the case of jihadis causing problems in Syria, creating a huge flow of refugees, and in invading Syria on multiple occasions, creating yet another flow of refugees! Ethnic cleansing is something the Turkish government excels at, with thousands of Kurdish villages having been destroyed and their civilian population having been driven away to areas where they no longer constitute an ethnic majority. But you and your brethren use that as a false ""But we have Kurds living in Turkey so we are not mistreating Kurds""-argument just like you attempt to do here with your ""but we have 4 million refugees"" remark.

&gt; You cannot call bullshit without reading the articles I linked. That is, you guessed it, bullshit!

You have deliberately held onto an article from 2015 that was debunked by the UN in 2017, posting it multiple times since to try to manipulate people, so yes, I call bullshit!

1458,"So what makes Sweden's strategy better? Most deaths have been older, but not all; Sweden has also lost more working age people, probably more than any other Nordic country has had in total deaths. There is no guarantee that a 2nd wave will come or that Sweden (or anyone) will have any significant herd immunity to it. There is also no guarantee Sweden will be significantly better off in terms of the economy either (initial forecasts said they won't), both because other countries closed down anyway (reducing tourism to Sweden and exports from Sweden), and because even with few restrictions internally and *even if Sweden or _no country_ would have implemented _any_ restrictions*, consumption and travel did still crash and would still have crashed due to general fear of the virus.

So Sweden has paid in with thousands of lives on a bet that has so far had no significant benefits. Even if there is a 2nd wave, minimizing the health impact of the 1st wave buys other countries time with fewer deaths, while medications and/or a vaccination is developed. If the 2nd wave starts while there are still significant community transmissions in Sweden, it might well ramp up faster and also spread more widely in Sweden.

Talking about forced lockdown vs loose lockdown when comparing Nordic countries also reveals a lack of understanding about how much ""locked down"" countries actually locked down. Afaik nowhere in the Nordics did we have ""forced lockdowns"" to the extent that France, Italy or parts of the US did. E.g. in Finland: schools mostly closed, but some 1st to 3rd graders were still taught at school; daycares stayed open but it was recommended people keep their kids at home, and 50 to over 90% did so (varied by area); restaurants were only allowed to sell food for delivery/take-away (but were never closed entirely, and you could still enter the premises for pickup; in parts of the US at least, curbside pickups were mandated); bars and nightclubs were simply closed (one of the few things that were fully forced shut); various public facilities including gyms closed but e.g. private gyms could legally stay open (the Elixia/SATS chain was the only one to close fully for some weeks afaik); all other stores were allowed to stay open but some safety procedures were recommended. You're implying Finland had a ""forced lockdown"", but even the strictest restrictions were still massively looser than what Italy and many other countries had.",Finland,/r/europe/comments/hbqv35/heavily_guarded_border_checkpoint_between_norway/fvf5294/,ohitsasnaake,1592637465

Debt was always going to go up during the recession, whether the Tories were in charge or not - output falling and people becoming unemployed are going to reduce tax takes and increase demand for benefits. 

The question is whether the best approach was capping the spike and having a slow recovery or letting it spike and having a potentially faster one, with the opportunity for a more marked decrease.

At the time there was a paper by a pair of economists, Reinhart and Rogoff, who predicted the end of growth if debt-GDP went over a particular level.

Do you have a better source than wikipedia on this? If you read the history tab on this, it seems like pink was, with few exceptions, always a feminine garment color, and that the exceptions occurred at two major points: at one point in time, pink was regarded as minor in relation to red's majority, hence at some specific point, there was an intentional and artificial imposition of pink upon boys because it was seen as a diminutive shade of red (which was ""for men"" at that time) instead of being seen in isolation as its own color; and then in the early 20th century there was again a sort of artificial push by some groups for pink as a boy's color. However, it seems like everything returned to base line and an observer of the history of pink in clothing wouldnt be totally blameworthy for thinking that these pushes for pink as a boy's color were born of a misguided taste.",,/r/europe/comments/hb82de/romania_gender_studies_ban_students_slam_new_law/fvel7rh/,Marthman,1592622063

C'mon bro, the plan was clearly to transfer the surviving Russian population to Nazi Germany for extermination once the war was over.

&gt;You should really read up what Finland did in that war and what it did not. Basically we did as little as possible for German benefit. Including the siege of Stalingrad.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_history_of_Finland_during_World_War_II#Assessment

""During the Continuation War (1941–1944) Finland was co-belligerent and a tactical ally of Nazi Germany against the Soviet Union, and dependent on food, fuel and armament shipments from Germany. Finland took part in the siege of Leningrad. In spite of this, Finland retained an independent democratic government. Moreover, during the war, Finland kept its army outside the German command structure despite numerous attempts by the Germans to tie them more tightly together.""

That's an alliance.

&gt;We even made a scheme that allowed us to break the no-peace treaty with Germany

Listen why do you think Finland joined the war? They were banking on the Germans genociding the Soviets. The scheme against the treaty was likely in case it backfired and the Germans lost, which they did.",,/r/europe/comments/hc04je/russias_putin_says_soviets_occupied_lithuania/fver51c/,Thecynicalfascist,1592626078

Yes you are right. As a leftist i actually am fully aware about the rampant inequality in all our societies. The thing is that in democracies in *theory* all people have the same right to participate in the political debate and therefore should in theory also have the same ressources to do so. That this theoretical equality is already vanished by law is another problem on top.

&gt;constitutional monarch arguably has less political agency than “normal” citizens,

So it's fucked both ways. 

&gt;Again, the existence of a monarchy is absolutely no indicator of how equal people are

The very core concept of monarchy is that people aren't equal. It doesn't matter that there are systems that are more shitty. Saudi Arabia is more free than NK. Is it therefore good?

* These are peaceful protests to support arrested presidential candidate Viktar Babaryka, blogger Sergei Tsihanouski and various other people.
* There were no leaders or any organization of these protests since many go-to-streets opposition leaders were already arrested last week.
* People were gathering on one of the central streets. When a car driving nearby beeps, people would clap. Sometimes people cry slogans to free the arrested people. Very tame.

1946,"The “we had no other choice” defense does not hold up for the simple reason that *every other country occupied by the Nazis did not do what France did.* 

What France should have done is evacuate the government and continue the fight from its colonies in coordination with the British. By signing an armistice, the Germans went from enemy occupiers to the legal authority. The French government gave the green light for collaboration. 

The idea that the Nazis would have tried to murder literally every single person in France is baseless. The French government should have instructed its citizens not to reveal who the Jews were, or tried to evacuate them, as the Danish did. 

Hundreds of thousands of French soldiers that were in Britain at the time of the Fall of France chose Nazi captivity over fighting on. 

&gt;Back to WW2, did some of us sold the jews for peace? 

The elected French government chose this, leaving DeGaulle to set up his own rival government rather than fighting on themselves. 

None of this means I think we should all hate France, but I think it’s important to condemn the actions of those that chose not to oppose the Nazis when so many others paid such a high price to resist.

Yeah he is almost 2 meters tall (almost 6'5)

Nope, early polls show they will mostly stay home, and of those who won't - more will actually vote for anti-Duda.

Second, Konfederacja isn't nationalists and far-right only, there are also many libertarians who hate ""socialism"", but don't care about LGBT. They will vote against Duda, because they are fine with president vetoing PiS' ""legislative diarrhea"".

Dark bread is kind of a German standard food that can go with anything, so maybe that would be something ppl eat there (google Roggenbrot or Vollkornbrot if you want a visual). If you're any good at doing accents you can always try to do a German accent for your NPCs, we absolutely do have an accent whenever we speak other languages. Our weather varies rather strongly between seasons, so in spring it would be raining a lot, in summer it's hot and most evenings you'll see heavy thunderstorms, in fall you're likely to see fog and grey skies and in winter there'll be snow. So maybe if it fits your setting you could even include some typical German weather.

Other than that I don't know what to tell you. We don't have a very strong national identity, but rather identify with our home town or region, so it's kinda hard to make a list of typical culturally German things bc that varies so much.

2227,"the magnitude was pretty clear early on too: if we change nothing and keep burning fuels, by 2100 we will warm about 1C.


The uncertainty that is still not decided is the knock on effect that the carbon has: that 1C of warming will make more water evaporate, hence more warming. But what if the water condenses into clouds - that might mean cooling depending on the type of clouds. What if plants absorb more CO2 as a result - that's a net negative. How do the winds change because of this 1C warming etc.


People like to believe simple truths, but global warming is not really simple, other than the fact that more CO2 -&gt; more warming.

2240,"FrEeZe PeAcH lol. Free speech sometimes clashes with other freedoms. Threats, incitement to murder, etc. clash with the freedom to live for example. Doctor's freedom of speech can clash with right to privacy, that's why we have medical privacy. Disclosure of state secrets interferes with its security. There are many more limitations to freedom of speech as it doesn't exist in a vacuum, it clashes with other rights and freedoms.

""the posts only contributed to that"" - yeah that's exactly why facebook and other sites should have fought against the freedom to incite genocide that you care so deeply about. I'm sure that with limited ways to spread fake news and hatred more people would live. But some minority lives are less important than freedom to incite to genocide, right? With an on/off switch  none of this would happen lol.

""And bullied kids can just block the bullies"" yeah because blocking someone online magically stops all feelings and internet never leaks into real life. Sorry but you're very deluded if you think blocking someone online changes anything. 

Arrests for hate speech are not ridiculous. What's ridiculous is having zero imagination and not learning from history what hate speech leads to. All genocides started with hate speech. If the state effectively deplatformed Hitler there would be no holocaust. If this piece of shit Alex Jones couldn't spread lies families of Sandy Hook victims wouldn't have to fear for their lives because of constant threats.

2342,"&gt;The 'Diccionario panhispánico de dudas' actually estates that 'castellano' is used when referring to the common language spoken in Spain in relation to the rest of official languages spoken in some regions.

However it also states that 'spanish' is the preferable one because it is less ambiguous and recommends reserving 'castillian' for the medieval variant of vulgar latin or for the dialect of the region of Castille proper

Here is what the panhispanic dictionary says:

&gt;***español. Para designar la lengua común de España y de muchas naciones de América, y que también se habla como propia en otras partes del mundo, son válidos los términos castellano y español***. La polémica sobre cuál de estas denominaciones resulta más apropiada está hoy superada. ***El término español resulta más recomendable por carecer de ambigüedad,*** ya que se refiere de modo unívoco a la lengua que hablan hoy cerca de cuatrocientos millones de personas. Asimismo, es la denominación que se utiliza internacionalmente (Spanish, espagnol, Spanisch, spagnolo, etc.). ***Aun siendo también sinónimo de español, resulta preferible reservar el término castellano para referirse al dialecto románico nacido en el Reino de Castilla durante la Edad Media, o al dialecto del español que se habla actualmente en esta región.*** En España, se usa asimismo el nombre castellano cuando se alude a la lengua común del Estado en relación con las otras lenguas cooficiales en sus respectivos territorios autónomos, como el catalán, el gallego o el vasco.

Translation for the highlights:


&gt;spanish. To refer to the language common of Spain and several american nations, which is also spoken elsewhere, castillian and spanish are valid terms.

&gt;The term 'spanish' is more recommended for it lacks ambiguity

&gt;Even though it is a synonym for 'spanish', it is preferable to reserve the term 'castillian' to refer to the dialect born in the medieval kingdom of Castille, or to the dialect spoken in this region currently",,/r/europe/comments/hbj5dp/residents_of_catalonia_by_identity_language/fvc16cm/,IactaEstoAlea,1592571956

By both Russia, Ukraine and Crimea. There a bit like the local Kurds: everyone around seems to like to give them a few good kicks just for fun.

&gt; I would presume that you have sympathy for separatist movements yourself, given the history of the region you display. So lets agree to disagree.

I think every group has a right for self-determination. And all of us missed a massive opportunity by neglecting and suppressing this right in the Crimeans for the past 30 years. I do not agree with some of the Russian methods and most of their motives surrounding the Crimean annexation, but there is no doubt this is what the local population actually wanted.

2510,"„WWI is historically a French victory, fought on French soil, with astonishing loss for the country. I don't see anything wrong in celebrating a righteous victory fought over righteous principles (notably taking back Alsace Moselle).“
It’s not that much of a french victory considering that they mostly hung on to british and american troops and later claiming to be the major victor (basically a wwII myth light). They didn’t fight for alsace moselle/lothringe but defended themselves so yeah that might be considered righteous but don’t put more moral into it than there was. And you could celebrate that but in the same way we could celebrate our victory in 1870/71 but we are sensible to our european neighbors.

„Regarding Napoleonic war, it was rather a struggle of imperial power, one ruled by France, another lead by England. Once again, the huge majority of Napoleonic wars were not declared by France.

It's history, it's not bad, nor good, each side had their reasons to go to war. It's not an English/coalition moral victory against an evil imperialist power. Just a struggle between nations as there was all throughout European history, we've lost this one, maybe it was for the best, maybe not, we will never know, but allow us not be particularly glad about a defeat that ended the most glorious (yet bloody) part of our nation history.“

Almost exactly the same could be said about wwI and germany, it was an imperialistic struggle that discharged when austria attacked in the balkans and triggered a complex of alliances in which italy betrayed their allies and germany ultimately fell short. 
Sure you can complain about a commemorative coin for waterloo but then stop singing germanophobe songs at wwI memorial events, it’s hypocritical.

Also northern Finland, lapland, has been having past few summers temperatures nearly equivalent to southern Finland, which is untypical to say the least.

I'm not meteorologist, but based on few previous years, there is clear trend of much higher temperatures in extreme northern Eurasia. I think this is tied to Gulf Stream and decreasing arctic seamasses with the global climate change. Sea water temperatures are increasing and with less ice the gulf stream reaches further, heating the nordic landmasses next to the sea more than previously was normal. Europe itself is already much warmer/temperate than equivalent latitudes in other parts of the world (Alaska/Canada at Scandinavias latitude are very cold and inhospitable places), and I think current changes are just extending these same effects to northern Eurasia.",,/r/europe/comments/hau6eg/climate_crisis_alarm_at_recordbreaking_heatwave/fvbks6a/,Ghorgul,1592557760

If you try to say that the baby cannot decide, because it is not able to understand, this opens up a different can of worms.  I think it's both so obvious and disgusting that I will not bother to pursue it further.

The EU is always written down but it's actually a success story. I'm wondering why you, as a Scot, prefer to have decisions made in Westminster when Westminster doesn't really care that much for Scotland.
Moreover, again, you should inform yourself how the EU works. There are no 'decisions made in Brussels'. Brussels is not a captial in the sense of an actual state. The power still lies within the member states and the member states as part of the EU council where the heads of governments meet. 
A Scotland as part of the EU had actually more say in it's own affairs than they do now in the UK, whether the UK is part of the the EU or not.

And again, as Scotland's independence: It would gather huge sums from the EU budget. It could do more with that public spending than it can now. You certainly know more about Scotland, of course, but I have toe feeling you still have a wrong picture how the EU works.

2979,"Serbia didn’t exactly call a poll throughout the Ottoman empire as to whether or not it could pretty please secede and change Ottoman borders to an indulgent &amp; peaceful approval of the Ottomans though, did it? Or take into mind the wishes of those living among them who did not wish to be in an independent Serbia? But you say that that shouldn’t matter because the Ottomans were mistreating Serbian people, so less than a million (678,192 in Serbia by the 1834 census...) were OK to revise those borders to bring hope to their people without taking the thoughts of the MUCH more numerous (couple tens of millions) people of the Ottoman empire into account. Great! ... And yet, somehow this becomes inapplicable for Kosovars who must suffer whatever the Serbian state puts on them because it is Serbian historical land. Never mind that medieval Serbian rule wasn’t as long as the previous Bulgarian nor Roman rule, and certainly not the subsequent Ottoman rule, anywhere where the Serbian flag once flew becomes historic Serbian land to the end of time regardless of the irrelevant opinion of the people who happen to live there.

That said, it’s understandable that you would have a clear distinction established between the two cases.

2982,"I find it interesting that a lot of people are looking at the part of Spain in a back-looking sort of way with the focus on 1. Catalonia or Galicia, 2. with the implicit notion of language, 3. how ethnicity is quickly constructed.

By the time this map was made, regionalism was a project confined to the middle classes. The lower classes for better or worse didn't care since they had their focus was on farming to eat rather than reading old medieval poetry while the businesses classes had interest deeply intertwined with the rest of the country. 

A lot of people for example, know about Galicia today because users will make a big deal about it if it come despite it being integrated into Spain for a long time. Regionalism that was serious didn't occur until the 1980s. It's in that sense I would say many people are looking at it in a back-looking 20th/21st century viewpoint since they wouldn't have been an ethnic group back then.

Not many people, aside from mostly Spanish people would even know about the other parts of Spain. Many of which integrated later than and are more or less are considered integral parts of Spain. For example: Andalusia, Valencia, Aragon, the Baleares. Even today, there are people moving to take one of the oldest parts of Spain: Asturias and construct an ethnic identity out of it based off of language. I find that sense of construction interesting since at the end of the day, people use them to make claims over dirt and soil lol.

However in English the usage is pretty different: Spanish is used to talk about the language and Castillian is used to talk about the variety of Spanish used in Spain.

So I hope that clears it. Finally it is indeed true that there are many other languages in Spain aside from Spanish. Such is the case also in Italy, Germany and France.

3049,"Majority of voters in the past 3 elections did not vote for the conservative party. 

The referendum had the highest turnout of any democratic vote so I'm not sure what you're really on about when you say ""who didn't bother to vote"". Despite the high turnout it still ended up only being 52-48, a close result for something that had become a highly controversial and polarising subject. The government has decided not only to satisfy the majority by leaving but to satisfy the most extreme supports who call for a hard brexit. These people are *not* the minority. For example, the government is refusing to extend the transition period even though without doing so we would likely leave with no trade deal come new year. Opinion polls show the majority of people want their to be an extension, so clearly the government isn't doing things based on whats popular. 

You also need to remeber that ""people"" includes everyone. It includes the ""48%"" as well as the ""52%"" (or atleast 48% 4yrs ago).

Iberdrola is one of the old energy companies, which like ( almost all of them) now invests heavily in renewable energies.

3163,"&gt; Yes, Turkey is indeed cozying with Russia to the point that Erdogan swept under the rug the fact that Russia killed dozens of Turkish soldiers in Syria, blaming it all on AsSaD, and then after a drone murder spree that didn't amount to anything gave up on even more territory to his big friend Putin.

Turkey needed to retaliate against Russia without provoking a direct conflict with much bigger nuclear superpower, so the airstrikes were blamed on Assad alone while Russia backpedaled and expressed it's ""sincere"" sympathies over the killed soldiers, and plenty of Russian Wagner mercs got killed in retaliatory strikes both in Syria and Libya, something Russians itself swept under the rug themselves.

Turkey is fighting a much bigger enemy essentially alone, while other NATO members offer next to nothing but supportive messages on Twitter, so Turks have to give concessions and maneuver the situation between millitary action and diplomacy. 

&gt; It is hilarious though that after you second paragraph, you are writing this. 'Don't mind us stealing your resources, look we are fighting Russia! Protect us instead!' Can you tell me what's the point of you being against Russia in Lybia when as far as EU is concerned, you are the biggest threat and danger to its interests there?

Turkey is in Libya legally and came there after official invitation by the UN-recognized Libyan government. Legitimate Libyan government gets saved, Turkey benefits from the resources, Russians lose millitary bases on NATO's southern flank. Win-win-win, basically.

I'm sorry but I just snorted like a swine irl reading this.

The older I get the more convinced I am slavs/eastern europeans have become servile in mentality, ""slaves"". Be it because of ottoman feudalism in the south or russian one in the north (later repainted with a red coat), we were taught to obey, the majority of us anyway. Even the younger, ""democratically""-born generation is lacking in their ability to explain what democracy means to them - that's what centuries of authoritarian rule might have caused this.

What does an obedient slave want? A strongman government/leader to tell them what to do.

That's on Serbia you know? It's far from being done with the chapters.

&gt;Merkel is also unpopular here due to her migrant policies and due to Germany being one of the more fanatical backers of Kosovo's independence.   

Everyone from the EU seems to be unpopular. Even though they do a lot for Serbia. I found this piece about helping WB including with the coronavirus outbreak and economic damage.   
https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_20_777
  
So much stuff but I bet many people in Serbia haven't even heard of it. Next programming period WB get 14.5 billion freaking euros of grants. I bet if Russian and China did a fraction of that it would be all over Serbian news and Vucic would be thanking them. But when it's the EU no one cares.  


&gt;Well, then check twitter, lots of liberal and pro-EU Serbs there, but what they do share in common mostly is No Kosovo = No EU.   

Tweets are surely much less representative than reddit.  

&gt;So fully abandoning our spiritual and cultural heritage, a large chunk of our land, 200k Serbs and a lot of resources...for a maybe? Yeah no, nobody in their right mind would ever do that.  

""Halfway abandoning it"" by not recognising it doesn't give you access to those either, no? 

Those resources can't be super important, Kosovo has them and it's still poor. Serbia would have to share them across an even larger population. Resources just aren't that important for a modern economy not unless you have obscene amounts of them.

Are there really 200k Serbs there? [Kosovo counts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Kosovo) 25k and  if they failed to count them for some reason the Yugo census still shows 190k before the war of which surely vast numbers have emigrated since, plus a negative natural growth.


&gt;Now, when it got all the Western  support....yes?  

Taiwan is in the top group of the world in ease of doing business,  economic freedom, corruption perception and has a nice democracy ranking. There's no way they didn't  end up rich with such strong fundamentals. And you don't need Western  support to climb those rankings although it does help.   


&gt;Sure, tell that to Transnistria,NK,South Ossetia,Palestine...etc.  

Uh, ok? I don't think it would help them much. NK would still be sanctioned to hell, Palestine would still be abused by Israel, Transnistria and Ossetia would still be parts of very poor countries that experienced wars and were occupied by a very corrupt country that gave them sham local democracies. Unlike them Taiwan is peaceful, democratic and business friendly which is the key  to its success.  


&gt;I meant as in educated manpower. The Taiwanese economy is mostly high quality electronics, communications and such, which is something you have to work years for to develop or have someone develop it for you. Kosovo can't do that.   

It's not impossible for Kosovo to develop the same  educated workforce. Not likely but not impossible.    

&gt;It is. Eurostat data shows 96k Albanians are leaving for the EU per year, while 55k Serbians are. Combined population of Kosovo and Albania makes about 4.5m, Serbia central and Vojvodina have around 7m.

3214,"&gt;New plants would have a relatively hard time competing with renewables and conventional plants.

Renewables had a pretty hard time competing with conventional plants a decade ago, too. That's why they had (and still have) state-guaranteed selling prices, grid priority and massive subsidies. Economy of scale lowers prices, no surprise there. For reference, France's switch to nuclear only cost half of what the Energiewende has so far in today's money, and led to a 80+% low-carbon electricity grid in a shorter timespan.

&gt;Regarding the risk assessment: risk is likelihood times impact. The likelihood of a major accident is very low, the impact in a country like Germany would be catastrophic.

I'd like an *actual* assessment on this, with figures. Japan is pretty densely populated, and an accident as catastrophic as Fukushima has only led to a single irradiation death so far. It has also led to no statistical increase in cancer within the general population (it has even dropped a little bit since). By any other metric - loss of inhabitable land, environmental damage - pales in comparison to the consequences of climate change.

It's also worth noting that, unlike Japan, Germany's plants aren't built in tsunami-prone areas.

&gt;The goal is relatively clearly to get all (or at least almost all) electrical energy from renewables.

No, to achieve carbon neutrality, we need to get all our energy **as a whole** from low-carbon sources, not just electricity. This includes things like transportation, heating, and industrial processes.

For comparison, France had a higher share of renewables in their energy budget than Germany (~17%) as late as 2018. Nuclear energy isn't counted. This should give you an idea of how far from carbon neutrality the most high profile renewable transitions actually are right now.",,/r/europe/comments/hbc520/german_foreign_minister_threatens_russia_with/fv9d3xo/,Perett2822120,1592507042

3295,"&gt;How has the UK de-legimitised the eurozone?

By trying to make it seem as something separate from the EU as as whole, since the UK's aim was always to keep the EU as just a trade block, and any form of further integration (like the EZ) has been a bad thing for you.

&gt;Not only that, it's nothing to do with the single market, never has been.

Likewise, if you view the single market as only a part of a trade block then yes. If you view it as a part of further integration, the relationship of it with the EZ is important.

&gt;Creating a monetary union without a corresponding fiscal union was a pigheaded decision that the EU ploughed ahead with anyway. You can't blame that on the UK.

Never disagreed with that one. Not sure why you think I am defending the EU on that regard.

&gt;Why should countries that never wanted to be part of the monetary union have to accept the relevant obligations of EZ members?

They shouldn't. But what you've tried to create inside the EU, with the EZ and non-EZ countries as opposite camps, fighting each other is nothing more than obfuscation. It's the same thing as when the ECC was formed with the ""inner six"" countries and then you went right away to form EFTA with the ""outer seven"". Keeping Europe fragmented as always, in typical British fashion.

&gt;The vast majority of European politicians deeply regret the UK's decision to leave, they didn't see the UK as a saboteur.

Two things: First of all, appearances have to be kept. Even if many of said politicians think that the UK was a saboteur they would never say it openly because it wouldn't be worth soiling relations for nothing, so of course they all say that they are sad and that you can ""come back anytime"". This is basic diplomacy. Secondly, many European politicians don't want to do anything else than to preserve the status quo (aka, do nothing to improve European countries and just sit on their asses forever) and have no will or vision whatsoever. So of course nobody would actually say they are glad for the UK to be out. What goes behind closed doors though is another thing.

&gt;Clearly you see anyone who doesn't completely toe the line with respective to your narrative of what the EU should be is nothing more than a spanner in the works. Is dissent and debate banned in the EU? Are differing opinions not allowed?

Excuse me but you can't be serious. The UK has been in the EU with the most special status, with your opt-outs, with your rebate, with your leading position against further integration and with your huge influence over the entire block. We all speak your language and the EU itself actually uses British spelling of all things (just to showcase that even in little things, you had a lot of sway). And yet none of that was enough for you so you left anyway.
We have already tried your way of doing things for at least 50 years now and it's clear that it's not working for the rest of Europe, aside from the UK. And that's evident by the sad state of the rest of Europe right now. The last thing you can accuse me, or the rest of the EU is not allowing other opinions/debate. As far as I am concerned, it's finally time to try something beyond the ""EU is just a trade block"" ideology, that has been prevalent for so many decades now.

&gt;You position has more than a slight overtone of fascism about it.

This sentence right here is enough for me to not take you seriously anymore. If you consider any of this ""fascism"" then all I can assume is that you don't take this seriously or that you are simply prejudiced against anything that speaks against your worldview. Either way, this and your next point sealed the fact that I shouldn't bother after this post.

&gt;Says all that we need to know.

And here is the worst part of it all. What does it say to you exactly? You glossed over everything I pointed out about Europe's defense needs, you completely ignored the turkish problem which is the biggest threat many European countries have to worry about and you took a condescending attitude over it. Don't expect me to take you seriously after this. And if this is Britain's attitude in general when it comes to this matter (which it seems to be), then forget about everything else, this reason alone is more than enough to want you out. 

&gt;So close to the US? No, it's because the UK is better at fostering innovation and providing capital. There is considerably more talent concentrated in London than anywhere in the EU. It's not a language thing.

I disagree. It is a language thing and you are indeed very close to the US. The ""special relationship"" is a thing, and that's just one of the many ways you are close with them. The fact that Britain was less affected from the war (compared to the rest of Europe which was in shambles) allowed a better recovery. Your close relationship with the Five Eyes countries and your use of the English language solidified that position afterwards. You may have given up the empire, but you've retained and built up all this financial/soft power because you are able to due to the US, your use of the English language and also the rest of the Anglosphere. And that's one more point here, no matter what happens, you always have the rest of the English speaking world to fall back to and to watch your backs. Europe only has itself and it needs to realize that over-relying on the English speaking world is not in our interest.

&gt;The EU doesn't believe in free markets, it's stated response is to subsidise 'European Champions' (lol). It cannot create competitors organically, so it will try to force them into being.

Realizing (albeit late) that some vital European companies need to stay European and not be bought out like they used to be isn't a bad thing. 

&gt;It cannot create competitors organically, so it will try to force them into being.

I will argue that the biggest reason of that is lack of proper integration. You guys can have companies with global projection because once again, you are part of the English speaking world and you are close to the rest of the Anglosphere/US. What does the rest of Europe have? The incomplete and fragmented single market?

&gt;You don't understand how capital markets work. Diffusion is an anathema, the concentration of activity in London benefits everyone.

While benefiting the UK most of all. Funny, isn't it.

&gt;The UK is not responsible for blocking fiscal integration within the eurozone.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/09/david-cameron-blocks-eu-treaty 

&gt;Until that happens, the EU will continue to have pathetic economic growth and deep structural issues.

And again, I am not disagreeing with that.

&gt;You completely fail to recognise that the most serious headwinds to progress do not come from the UK but from other EU member states.

It is both. The UK has been up to its usual, centuries old shenanigans of keeping Europe divided for their benefit and the rest of the EU member states have grown complacent and still haven't found their place in the world after WW2. 

In the end, all I care about at this point is that you get out and stay out. Go do your own thing, be it CANZUK, even closer relationship with the US or whatever else you think is good for you and I wish you good luck with it. I don't care as long as you stop trying to influence the rest of the continent. Despite all that's been said, I don't even wish ill upon you, I just think that this was never going to work out in the first place and you leaving is a vital thing for both sides, for the EU even more so. 
Also, I am not gonna bother replying to you anymore after this.

What more did it give? I wouldn't be surprised if the EU pays more to candidate countries now than it did to the 2004 wave.    

&gt;is an achievement and can be in no way labeled as a 'euroskeptic country'.   

It's definitely euroskeptic. Even here on reddit where most users are younger and more connected to Western culture because of English and slightly more educated Serbs are still euroskeptic despite those usually being the most pro-EU demographics. I've seen another forum where the users were definitely more educated and still they were solidly anti-EU (they had a poll).  And it's not just about joining, even the Serbs that want to join rarely speak well of the EU. I'm not saying they have to but in the end of the day that does make them euroskeptic.   


&gt;No we have not?  

Do Albanians in Kosovo have Vucic on their TV? Do they follow Serbian laws, use Serbian money? Do they obey Serbian courts or have Serbian police, pay taxes to the Serbian government and receive benefits same as other citizens of Serbia? Serbia may not admit but practically it has lost Kosovo. It's not part of it.   

&gt;But we are participating?

&gt; Monsieur Paris asked if he might bury the leg in his garden, later turning the place into a kind of shrine, as for a relic. Visitors were first taken to see the bloody chair upon which Uxbridge had sat during the amputation, before being escorted into the garden, where the leg had its own 'tombstone', … 

&gt; The leg attracted an amazing range of tourists from European society of the very top drawer, from the King of Prussia to the Prince of Orange. It was a nice earner for Monsieur Paris and his descendants, all the way down to 1878, when it was the occasion for a minor diplomatic incident. Uxbridge's son visited, to find the bones not buried, but on open display. On investigation by the Belgian ambassador in London, it was discovered that they had been exposed in a storm which uprooted the willow tree beside which they were buried. The ambassador demanded repatriation of the relics to England but the Paris family refused, instead offering to sell the bones to the Uxbridge family, who were enraged. At this point the Belgian Minister of Justice intervened, ordering the bones to be reburied. However, the bones were not reburied; they were kept hidden. In 1934, after the last Monsieur Paris died in Brussels, his widow found them in his study, along with documentation proving their provenance. Horrified by the thought of another scandal, she incinerated them in her central heating furnace.",,/r/europe/comments/hbam6q/205_years_ago_today_the_battle_of_waterloo_took/fv8zowx/,strolls,1592499783

At no point did I imply that economics was a black and white issue, or reduce this argument. You merely had to ask for me to explain my point instead of being so sure in your own.

When a nation creates high barriers to trade, historically, it has had a negative impact on GDP. Similarly, harsher border restrictions lead to an reduced number of migrants. You might consider this a good thing. The economy does not. Migrant labour allows an economy to grow, as studies show migrants put more into an economy than they take out. 
Including taxes and other contributions. 

Brexit is heavily focused on both of these things, and the uncertainty of trade with the EU, who a large portion of UK companies (that export or offer services) trade with, has  made companies take the decision to hold back resources which would have otherwise been used to grow the business.

S-400 is a surface-to-air missile designed to shoot down potential threats from the sky, such as other missiles and aircraft. No Kurdish factions, whether the ones allied with Turkey (Peshmergas) or fighting against Turks (PKK and YPG) have any air forces, so I don't know what you're talking about.

Back in the 90s Iraq war and at early stages of Syrian conflict various crap that fighting sides involved there were shooting at each other would constantly land on Turkish soil, leading Turkey to request US, Spain and Netherlands to deploy their Patriot missiles on Turkish borders to intercept future potential threats, and ever since Turkey was looking forward to develop it's own systems like that.

&gt; You bombed Kurds in Iraq the day before and noone batted an eye...

Nobody bombed ""the Kurds in Iraq"" the day before, these airstrikes were directed at PKK, which is designated as a terrorist organization by NATO and the European Union. Would be weird for someone to bat an eye at millitants they designate as terrorists, wouldn't it?

Haftar does not equal Russia, this is either intentionally or unintentionally simplistic to the point of being a lie. The LNA led by Haftar is also supported by Israel, Greece, Cyprus, the KSA, the UAE, Jordan, Egypt, Sudan, Syria, and under the guise of anti-ISIL operations, the US, the UK, and France. 

Haftar himself is a dual US-Libyan citizen and was a CIA asset during the 90's and 00's living by the CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, US. The US has allowed for the transfer/re-sale of arms from the UAE to Haftar, indicating they give him a fair amount of support. 

Do you have a source for Russia building a naval base in Libya? 

Also, I'm sure you're aware that the most prominent reason for Israel's, Egypt's, Syria's, Cyprus's, and Greece's support for Haftar comes from the fact Turkey is trying to monopolise energy transfer and energy production in the East Mediterranean, which is considered a threat to Europe.",,/r/europe/comments/hbcqp5/france_calls_out_nato_over_turkey_problem_as/fv8l4xz/,svartsyn_,1592492560

“But that does not mean that 60% of Germany's energy comes from Russia - Germany's energy mix for power production is about 40% coal, more than 30% renewables, less than 20% gas and 10% nuclear, according to Marex Spectron.

The country is trying to reduce its use of coal and cut out nuclear altogether, which means its use of gas and renewables is likely to increase.”

Also I am not sure if most are aware of the implications of a unified corporate tax system (CCCTB proposal) at all. They all just think it will solve every tax related problem (even if there are none present). 

And this digital tax on US tech-companies. Firstly, it will probably need a constitution ammendment in most member states since taxes can only be levied by their respective national governments. Secondly, every member state has to be in favour of such a tax (unanimity).

&gt; I'm not saying that Brexit did not have a cost for UK growth, that is manifestly obvious

which in case this needs to spelled out for you, is the same as saying ""Brexit had a negative effect on economic growth"". 

Second, I'm not going to put a number on it myself because, as I went to pains to point out in the opening paragraphs, estimating this is extremely difficult. And anyone claiming that they *know* what the actual cost was isn't being honest. They are guessing and their guesses are predicated on hell of a lot of assumptions. If you are incapable of grasping the nuance here, I suggest you refrain from opining on the subject. 

All I said was that the number given by Bloomberg, £200bn is probably to high (and then told you why I think their methodology is flawed). £0bn is definitely too low, the truth almost surely lies somewhere in between.

&gt; 350 million week to the nhs, easiest deal in the history, we hold all the card, will of the poeple, sovereignty, strong and stable etc.

Irrelevant to this discussion, seems like a miserable attempt at an ad hominem attack since you apparently aren't capable of actually refuting a single I made. 

&gt; And this is why I am glad the UK is leaving with a no deal.

As for Independent (lol) link; if you'd bothered to look up where Jan Vlieghe got those figures, you'd realise that its exactly the same [flawed methodology](https://twitter.com/EdConwaySky/status/1095982628715532289/photo/1) that Bloomberg are using. At least they had the decency to provide confidence intervals, where you'll see that the damage could well be only half of the reported headline £40bn per year. 

Moreover, BoE (any central bank really) research is often put out to support monetary policy decisions. It's no secret that Jan (a Belgian btw) is not a fan of Brexit and is on the dovish side of the MPC.

Basically the same mechanism is responsible for fall of population in Asia - just with one child policy China has effectively capped their fertility ratio for a good while at around 1, which results in relatively low number of adults in reproductive age right now. So as older, more numerous generations will die of the old age - overall population will fall.

3572,"&gt;Our army has the 7.62 Maximi, thats pretty heavy. :) But my biggest problem with it is the stock, its too short for me.

The Maximi is indeed heavy for what technology can achieve nowadays. But I guess that's what you get for doing repeated upgrade to a 46 year old technology...

&gt;You can make lightweight guns but its always a compromise. Some rifles  have laughably thin barrels. Polymers and aluminium have their own  drawbacks. Some series of the CZ Scorpion EVO 3 have serious problems  with the receiver twisting or bucking.

I think that comes from low material quality as there are slightly lighter guns that don't have that problem like the B&amp;T APC9.

&gt;900 m/s with that much weight? Thats ridiculous. Especially if youre  supposed to achieve that with the modern short barrels. The whole point  of these calibers is supposed to be slightly better than 5.56 when it  comes to ballistics and only make recoil slightly worse.

The barrel length is dependent on the manufacturer's design. For instance, General Dynamics is proposing a rifle with a 20in barrel and an ""automatic rifle"" with a 22in barrel. Both use the same bulpup design to compensate. SIG on the other hand has a 16in barrel on its MG and 13in on its rifle but use a conventional design.

In my opinion, GD has the best ammo design as well as the best rifle designs since it is the only one that also includes recoil mitigation in the rifle. However, since they use same design for the rifle and the ""automatic rifle"", they don't have the best MG since it is just a mag fed thing.

SIG probably has the best MG design.","Belgium, Benelux, EU",/r/europe/comments/h81jjy/camouflage_and_assault_rifles_in_europe/fv898wv/,loicvanderwiel,1592485865

3589,"&gt;Rubber bullets are deadly, laughing is deadly, you cannot guarantee tear gas wouldn't adversely affect an individual and kill them

You claimed in your quote he was effectively in favour of non-lethal ones. Playing whataboutism is laughable. He supported the use of gases known to be lethal (as I have said, the death rate of mustard gas victims was 2.5%). End of story he supported the use of deadly gasses, proving you wrong.

&gt;I however am confident in saying tear gas is less lethal than bullets.

Again, lying that he was talking about tear gas. I have already proven you wrong on this. Please stop lying and accept he was not talking about tear gas

&gt;M devices, as I understand, aren't lethal either and are designed to cause discomfort to a soldier forcing them to remove their mask.

You don't understand correctly then. I have already provided a quote on how the M device was considered to be the most effective gas weapon of the time. The M device was dropped in Russia at Churchill's command, in just one case where soldiers were hit by the gas 25 died. It was designed to kill - that is a fact


&gt;Invasion fears had mostly subsided by then, firstly Barbarossa was underway, the blitz failed, and Britain had rearmed after Dunkirk

Doesn't change anything, it's still a fact he planned to use it and stockpiled tonnes because he knew Germany had far more gas than the UK (UK had 450 tonnes of mustard at the time of Dunkirk which would have lasted 2 days worth of bombings on the German invaders

&gt;That seems to be the full paragraph from your source, you seem to have left out the bit about it being a retaliatory strike. 

&gt;Why is that?

Because it proves he was happy to use the weapons, whether preemptive or reaction doesn't matter, the argument was that he wanted deadly chemical weapons ready to use - as I said


&gt;I like how you accuse me of being a revisionist while leaving out sections from your own source because it wouldn't suit your narrative.

As I explained above, the fact it would be used as a retaliation is irrelevant. I claimed he was in favour of these weapons that could kill. You claimed he wasn't. History proves he was willing to use them and happy to do so. You are a liar and revisionist because you're claiming he only wanted to use tear gas, the fact of history is that he was happy to use deadly gasses. That is the only narrative, I never claimed he wanted to use them only as a weapon in return for an attack of the same kind thus there is no need to include that bit of the quote as it's irrelevant to the argument over whether he was in favour of deadly gas or if he just wanted to use tear gas as you claimed

Hopefully we've taken on board the lessons the EU have given here so that we continue to build these requirements into British law.

3675,"You claimed the vast majority of the 76 countries to be either a European microstate or EEA member. Then you listed 17 states.

17 of 76.

Then let's take a look of what you consider a microstate by removing all the EEA members.

* Switzerland -&gt; The 20^th largest economy in the world

* Ukraine -&gt; The 2^nd largest country in Europe, coming only after Russia.

I am willing though to let the Balkan states pass, while not microstates they are currently getting integrated into the EU.

I think it's great for the UK that they managed to roll over previous agreements. However it is a lot easier to roll over an agreement without changing anything than to cut all the commitments while trying to still reap the benefits while also trying to play hardball. Which is what the UK is trying with the EU. Unsuccessfully I might add, to the surprise of absolutely no one except Brexiteers.

&gt; I can think of half a dozen (influential) EU member states that are adamantly opposed to further fiscal integration. Similarly, there are plenty who do not support military integration at all and are extremely wary or additional political integration.

&gt; You act like the EU27 are a homogeneous block and that none of them actually shared a lot of opinions with the UK, this is ridiculous.

There are still plenty of obstacles in the way of true European integration. That much is true

&gt; Right, at least you admit that you can't reason this out in a considered and sober way, your feelings will always lead to to cherry pick facts and predjudge everything. I have no time for the hardcore brexiteers or people like you. You don't care about what the reality is, ideologues never do.

Yes, I do prejudge as I'm unable to understand the gained independence that Brexiteers perceive. However I don't think I cherry pick facts. I think that Brexit was an absolute retarded economic move.

According to the home office there were 8 right wing terror attacks since 2017. I wonder why noone heard about them. Lets see.

Well if we do a little search we see that the home office is counting cases like this:

 [https://www.surreycomet.co.uk/news/national/uk\_today/18524293.boy-14-charged-plotting-terror-attack/](https://www.surreycomet.co.uk/news/national/uk_today/18524293.boy-14-charged-plotting-terror-attack/) 

A single member terror cell formed by a 14 year old. He seems to be a right wing terrorist.

A 50 year old guy who wounded an african with a knife and damaged a few cars. He seems to be a right wing terrorist too.  

And keep in mind these are the best examples of the home office, these are the public ones. The rest are even worse, like that group who was sentenced for being in a group of people sharing right wing propaganda among each other.

Around the 9th century, on the river routes to the [Black Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sea), they had an unclear but significant role in forming the principality of [Kievan Rus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kievan_Rus), gradually assimilating with local [Slavic populations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavic_peoples).

3760,"&gt;So the claim is that we need distinction between sex and gender because man and women exhibit different traits, behaviors and characteristics which come from social upbringing and not from biology.

There are aspects of behavior that can absolutely come from biology, so, no, you're wrong. For example biological males do not menstruate and do not lactate. 

&gt; At the same time these traits, behaviors and characteristics are irrelevant to being a man or a woman because all that matters here is ones self declaration and societal approval. 

The science merely recognises that there are fluid social norms and roles to gender, not that these are irrelevant. If you mean they are irrelevant to sex - yes, most behaviors are irrelevant to sex, expect for very specific ones (which I mentioned as examples). 

&gt; As a bonus we are taught by feminists that gender roles are evil patriarchy, which should be abolished 

If you recognise that gender roles do impede your individual capacity as a human to act in a way you want - yes, you'd probably  be for pushing towards not having gender roles (and gender) at all. There are a lot of harmful things that arise from gender, by the way, but I am not arguing for that here.

&gt; and transgender people want us to recognize them as their declared gender because they act according to their chosen gender roles. 

Yes? Transgender people are put in the rough spot where they have to hyper-conform to gender norms to be recognised as the gender they feel they are like, but, again, this comes from the societal expectations they grew up with to what it means to be a man or woman.

&gt; Tldr social sciences are a self-contradictory joke.

I congratulate you that you are one of the saner ones then. Most of the folks in your field now openly state that sex doesn't exist.

&gt;It's just gender that differentiates whether the length of hair determines if you're perceived as a man or woman.

No. What determines if you are woman or man is sex you have not what you wear or how you do your hair. Different sexes choose to wear different stuff but that does not mean their clothes make who they are. I don't wear pants because i want to be man i wear pants because that is trend of the day for men. In 100 years from now on i could wear dresses and i would still be a man just fashion would change.

No one looks at someone who wear dress and says : 

She must be a woman because she wears dress.

They truly say this:

She must be a woman because this is what women usually wear.

3783,"&gt; The vast majority of those countries fall into two categories - European microstates or EEA members, i.e. they didn't negotiate a trade deal, those countries simply elected to be part of the customs union or single market. - Small, mostly economically irrelevant countries with which the EU has a very basic agreement that basically allows for higher quotas and reduced tariff on a very small number of goods where the EU does not perceive a threat to it's own producers. It's worth noting that the EU will impose limits and tariffs if the volume of imports ever gets 'too high'; free trade indeed.

I did obviously not include EU countries so the only EEA countries are Iceland and Norway and Liechtenstein. [Here is a map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_free_trade_agreements#/media/File:EU_FTAs.svg) to better visualize with whom the EU has an agreement. It is true that most FTAs have some limitations, but that is par of the course so it does not detract from the comparison with other major economies who also apply those limitations on their FTAs.

&gt; Complete bollocks. The UK's position has been; let's strip away as much of the political and regulatory baggage as possible, and try to maintain as much of the frictionless trade as possible. 

That is true. However it is not something the EU will ever accept.

&gt; They even concede that they know that this might mean some tariffs and border checks, and they are happy to accept those in return for reduced integration.

They are however not willing to accept the limited access the EU is offering given the reduced integration the UK is asking for.

&gt; The EU continues to insist that nothing should change, it's ridiculous (although privately both sides would make some concessions, whether that's enough to reach the finish line is another matter).

This is just blatantly false. The EU is quite transparent if you know where to look. To quote them ""The first of January 2021 will not be like 1 February 2020. Come what may, it will no longer be business as usual for the UK or for us."" from the press conference of the first round of EU-UK negotiations earlier this year.

This is the EU's official agenda on the negotiating table. https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_20_326

&gt; 1) The EU refused to make any changes to the WA. The substance didn't change, so why would the outcome of a vote in Parliament change?

If you want more concessions you also need to offer something in return... otherwise yes, you will get the same deal.

&gt; 2) Elements of the EU (particularly in the EP) actively colluded with remainer MPs to try and stop Brexit, bring about a 2nd ref. That fundamentally undermined the effort to pass the Withdrawal Agreement.

Do you have a legit source for that? I don't think you need any collusion for remainers to vote against Brexit.

&gt; It's always sooooo easy to spot the people who don't understand how the EU works and are clueless when it comes to history. The UK has never held the EU back, you will hopefully realise this as it becomes manifestly apparent that the EU is just as dysfunctional and just as inefficient as when the UK were members.

The UK always saw the EU as an economic union only and hold back further military, financial and political integration. As a federalist I'm glad you voted leave. But yes, we will have to see what the future brings.

&gt; And there we go, the petty, vengeful and arrogant disposition shines through brilliantly. You cannot pretend to have no bias, you cannot act like you are putting forward a reasoned position. You are totally incapable of being objective.

3797,"&gt; Terrorism is the use or threat of action, both in and outside of the UK, designed to influence any international government organisation or to intimidate the public.  It must also be for the purpose of advancing a political, religious, racial or ideological cause.

&gt; Examples include:

* serious violence against a person or damage to property,

* endangering a person's life (other than that of the person committing the action),

* creating a serious risk to the health or safety of the public or a section of the public,

* action designed to seriously interfere with or seriously to disrupt an electronic system.

&gt; It is important to note that in order to be convicted of a terrorism offence a person doesn't actually have to commit what could be considered a terrorist attack. Planning, assisting and even collecting information on how to commit terrorist acts are all crimes under British terrorism legislation.

3823,"And even that isn't really that accurate overall. You may get some idea if you simply want to compare countries but it's damn near impossible to get any accurate number for a specific country.

The social distancing, washing hands, ""lock down"" etc. obviously also impacts the spread of things like influenza which is very common around the same time that Covid popped up, so you may not end up with *that* many extra deaths since influenza usually kills people as well. You may also have fewer deaths from traffic related accidents, work related accidents etc. since most people were sitting at home way more than usual.

So just because you don't see many ""extra deaths"" overall doesn't mean that Covid didn't kill a lot of people, it may simply be that we've prevented a lot of ""normal"" deaths at the same time. However, you may obviously be able to compare countries that way to some degree, if one country has no extra deaths and another country has a lot of them, that could be a useful comparison but you still don't really know how many Covid killed in either country.

Another potential issue could be that the usual influenza may not have hit certain countries much at all if they usually get it from cross-border movements. It usually hits in the colder months after all which seems to indicate that it thrives in colder temperatures and thus it may not really impact the warmer countries much at all if no one's able to travel there due to a Covid lock down. So they may have way fewer influenza deaths this year for all we know.

That is exactly the problem, the fish it wants to consume locally are not commonly found in the UK waters.

&gt;The UK made zero money from that so they have nothing to lose. 

Actually that is not true. Yes, the UK companies didn't make all the money of the UK waters, but they made money in EU waters where they caught the fish that were actually eaten in the UK.

It was less than the UK could theoretically get from its own waters, but it wasn't 0.

So if there is no EU-UK trade deal, yes they can fish however much they want in their water, yes it could be theoretically be more, but the fish might have to be frozen to be exported, which lowers the price.

And to export the fish, the companies have to abide with the regulations of the destination market when it comes to food handling. While the UK under the umbrella of the EU had trade deals all over the world where food quality was declared equal, thus regulations were no problem for export, these deals have to be replicated, otherwise all the companies that want to export have to produce their export products to the export markets standards.

3841,"&gt;A prominent Russian Orthodox priest who was barred from preaching for his anti-coronavirus views has laid siege to a women’s monastery...

-

&gt;Father Sergei is known as the former confessor of several public figures including Russian lawmaker and former Crimean prosecutor Natalia Poklonskaya. The ex-policeman changed his secular name to Nikolai Romanov, in honor of Russia’s last emperor, and previously spent 13 years in prison for murder.
&gt;
&gt;Father Sergei now faces an ecclesiastical court for defying bans on public ministry as well as a secular court on suspicion of inciting hatred. During its first session this week, Father Sergei accused Orthodox Church leader Patriarch Kirill of betraying the faith.

https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/russian-priest-to-build-worlds-largest-orthodox-church-k8f2rvr82

&gt;Russian priest to build world’s largest Orthodox church

-

&gt;The project is being masterminded by Father Sergei, a former policeman who served 13 years in a penal colony on charges that included murder, the Znak news website reported.

-

&gt; Zhanna Ryabtseva, a senior official with the All-Russia People’s Front, a pro-Kremlin organisation, said that the construction of the church was “in God’s hands”. She declined to identify the investors in the project, describing them only as “the spiritual children of Father Sergei”.

-

&gt; Aside from counselling the rich and influential, Father Sergei, whose life story resembles that of Rasputin, is the informal head of Russia’s tsar worshippers. Followers carry religious icons bearing the image of Tsar Nicholas II, who was executed with the rest of the royal family by Bolshevik revolutionaries in 1918.

3898,"Ya, but look at how European countries decide to ""get stuff done"" to catch up in tech.  They want state funded enterprises while enacting protectionist legislation all the while thinking high taxes and burdensome regulation should be *increased* to help the tech sector.  Much of Europe thinks it can tax and regulate away the problem.  Having too strong of worker protections not only makes the labor market rigid and not as dynamic to respond to downturns and upturns, it also discourages companies from doing business there in the first place.  

This was all well and good when Western Europe and the US were so far ahead technology wise that the rest of the world had little choice but to buy from one or the other because mo other country was capable of producing it.  But now the world is catching up, and Europe keeps losing its share of global GDP to developing countries while the US has been relatively stable at 25% sincr we are an atttractive destination for business.  The US may pay far too much on military, but at least it produces tangible products and even helps fund itself with weapons sales.  It also gives the US its hard power.

The strong/bloated (depending on your views) welfare state of Europe is admirable for its humanist views.  It does conteibute to a happier population, but beyond that it is basically a sink hole of money.  Most of the people living on the government dole dont ever change to be productive in society, they just take and tske.  All Im saying is that it appears European countries are going to have to cut back on such programs in the future once Europe transitions to a less important economy as the Asian tigers continue to rise.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/hapqty/eu_moves_to_shrink_chinese_us_influence_in_its/fv7m332/,JakeAAAJ,1592465308

From day one on, they started to not allow old people to be admitted, dead people weren't collected, they decided to only care for young people the first weeks.

More importantly, anyone should do the few minutes work of comparing at least average death toll to current death toll for their own country for any range of numbers.

This is such a big fucking horrible topic and we had 4 massive WHO including scandals with MERS, SARS, the swine and pig flu.

you can find articles like this en masse from a lot of different publications, ranging for a decade before the current corona crisis

there is also a lot of material on WHY the WHO is one of the most corrupt and most damage causing entity in modern times (has a lot to do with pharma interests if anyone can't believe that corruption could exist anywhere...)

and now every single publication that was once critical only produces material on how trust worthy and world saving they are

many people believe who were faced with the HcG in Kenya story couldn't believe it, very similar or absolutely the same scandals happened in Indonesia, Phillipines, Mexico and another state I forgot.

Ethiopian jews returning to Israel had to suffer something very similar, people in the US have suffered this up until the seventies.

imagine what porphyrin has to do with blood and why g6pd is so important for blood, but not only blood but for dozens of critical life sustaining proteins and it'll all be used up, to repair blood.

At least a few countries regularly test for this, given how fucking cheap the test of it and that it only requires a light.

Imagine a world where the media wouldn't from one to the other day get on one singular line, because they all feel they're working on the axis of good against the dumb and stupid population and only by doing this, give people immense economic weapons they just use over and over again, with everything dropping out of our consciousness within 2-3 years.

At least inform yourself and compare average death toll to current death toll for every single country of interest, overall it will take you less time to research a hundred countries that way than ask a thought through question on here and engage over it afterwards.

Sweden or Berlin would imho be of great interest or China and their 11 million test.

Since financial crisis support was directly linked to the numbers you could show case in those places, we gave bad and corrupt people ample opportunity to game the system for their or their regions benefits and the media told us that none but the first top on the CEBM list can be trusted, any doctor critical of what media darling doctors said were preemptively cancelled by ""online antifacists"" and the media, aiming their ray of idiocy and attention.

Art its height the testing capacity was 400K test weekly. It is now 320K. And for those 320K test we find nearly no covid (as said, 0.8% positive hit rate).

3941,"""tl;dr""

Europe has about 2 times the population which makes the US have 8 times the infections per capita, Europe is made out of many federated republics, some have countries with a lot of leeway, like Germany where every single german country can do what they want.

Many places with no hygiene laws or barely any (Sweden and Berlin) do not experience massive disease, despite people in Berlin caring a lot less than in Sweden, partying being so bad that the police regularly has to break up parties of hundreds to thousands or just give up preemptively like on Pentecoast where they only cancelled the floating party but gave up on the other thousands of people everywhere around Kreuzberg.

Outside is more full than usual because a lot less people are working and it's a massively urbanized center.

There are very genetic reasons why people die horribly from complications and others not, age is also a genetic factor.

But I mean the two most common groups of mutations that regularly kill people over minor infects.

Favism (G6PD) and Cytochrome mutations

Why would we not test for them like other countries? Especially if we know that any racial group that dies more of Corona, can be mapped to Favism?

There is a reason it's worst where every other person carries it, there is a reason it's extremely bad in groups where one in five carries it.

It can be tested by shining a fluoroscent light at blood.

But people are not worth anything unless it is to force policy, for sure not for their own value of life.

If it interests you, invest the time to compare countries and areas with others, US is similarly varied in it's corona issues and especially new york's groups that massively die to it are also groups with extremely high favism rate, something you really might look up to understand how easily it kills with all kind of diseases if you have bad luck to get strong viremia.

This also holds true for any other possible disease and other mutations, you could look it up through any natural immunity that was researched.",,/r/europe/comments/harwg1/europe_vs_usa_daily_confirmed_covid_cases/fv7d8l4/,throeavery,1592457815

The logical compromise would be to for certain purposes no longer classify China as a single entity, but rather region by region.

3955,"In a number of ways.  It’s the only major city right on the border, and has a major city on each side of the border.  Together, they have a population of around 3 million.  It’s also a really unique dynamic there, because Juárez (on the Mexican side) is often the most dangerous city in the world (in terms of number of murders), but El Paso is an extremely safe city, one of the safest in the U.S.  Because of the large cities, you have tens of thousands of people who cross the border from Mexico to the US daily, usually on foot, for work and school. 

Then you also have the very unique history of the city.  It’s too much to go into on my phone, but just as an example, the area was subject to a border dispute until the 1960s, and the treaty that was eventually signed literally split families across borders, instantly placing some people in a different country than they were in the day before. 

And of course demographically it’s unique.  Texas is relatively Mexican-American, but in El Paso, about 80-90% of the population is Mexican-American.  This results in a distinctly Mexican culture, which is not shared in any other major city in Texas.  It also means that it’s very hard to meaningfully live here if you only speak English.

And economically, for such a large city, El Paso does very poorly compared to other cities in Texas.

Geographically, we are the only place in Texas with mountains, including being very close to Guadalupe Peak, the highest point in Texas.  And we’re just very far from the rest of Texas.  The next major city in Texas is about a twelve hour drive from me.  This results in more travel and cultural exchange with New Mexico (which is about 40 minutes from me) and even Mexico (which is about 2 minutes from me and I can see pot my window) than the rest of Texas.  Hell, I think I can drive to Mexico, New Mexico, California,  and Colorado, more quickly than I can drive to the nearest major city in Texas.

3979,"I absolutely agree with that. The capitalist system thrives through exploitation, unfortunately.

For raw - not processed - meat, there are some ways where you can control a bit of the circumstances. Some butchers still slaughter themselves, or receive their meat from local farmers that butcher the animals themselves. Some farms sell meat directly, and usually you can ask where the animal was butchered. 

With research, you can limit the amount of animal and human suffering included in your food - for example, some farms let you pick your produce at flatrates or per kilogramm, so it'll be your labour and sweat rather than someone's from Romania who receives four bucks for a full day of work. But that requires time, research, mobility and a lot of money, and is not an option for near everyone who works a 9-5. It'll also limit your options, as there is next to no processed food this applies to. 

But ultimately this is just removing yourself from the chain of suffering and won't fundamentally change anything.

4112,"&gt;Turks being forced out of Greece was genocide. There, see how easy that was.

Yes, it is easy when there is nothing else that follows. Now try to make all of Balkans, Greece and Armenians admit this formally and get ready for payback for the genocides they committed and ethnic cleansing they've done. Tell me how easy that is.

&gt;What happened to the Armenians however is not comparable to any crimes they may have committed. 

around 3.5m to 4m Armenian/Greek/Etc died during those times. Around 3m to 3.5m Muslims (mostly Turks and Kurds) died in those times.

But yeah, totally not comparable.

Almost all (95%) of the Muslim heritage was destroyed in all of the Balkans in an act of ethnic cleansing. But that is not as important either for you, or you simply didn't know this either. What about the 3m muslims that were exiled from their land? Probably they just deserved it amiright?

&gt;Now can you stop the whataboutism and admit Turkey committed genocide against them and it was evil

I can, i always do. Except the ""evil"" part, i don't really use such words with no real meaning behind it. It was a horrible act, if that is what you wanted to say. And a genocide.

But since i know deep down, you never knew Muslim deaths were this high, and now that i told you, you'll not even bother learning about it is the sad part for me. 

So don't act all high and mighty morally speaking, it is not fooling anyone. You don't care about genocides, or ethnic cleansings that were done. You care about ""Turkey bad"", rest is history.",,/r/europe/comments/hak9jx/ethnic_cleansing_by_turkey_continues_and_the/fv6p663/,Ecmelt,1592442440

Russia and China have chosen to utilize that sentiment and take the totalitarian route of making enemies outside of the country to give purpose for people. I don't want to seek purpose from enemies outside of the union. And who knows what the fuck is going on in the USA.

The best I can think of right now is making space travel a purpose for EU, catch up with the other superpowers. But right now European efforts into that are embarrassingly indifferent.

4191,"Oh congrats on getting Russian money, karma will get you hard. So I hope they paid you a lot. And where are you from? 

Russian side doesn’t want it soldiers to be killed of course, but it will not base their strategy to minimize casualties. Especially with civilians, they don’t give a shit. They put their artillery right behind the 16store building with civilians’ apartments. Ukraine doesn’t play like that. That’s what I meant. 

The harshest battles took place right on the days of negotiations, no surprise. And you do realize that unlike Ukrainian army which was deliberately being corroded up to 2014, Russian military never actually stopped practicing be it Chechnya, Moldova, Georgia or Syria. So thanks to the volunteers some of who had experience in Afghanistan, our forces did fight back.

Like battles over Donetsk airport. You really think only 43 died on your side as reported by fucking “spokesman of DNR”? Ukrainian side claims 800 dead enemies which I totally understand might be a stretch, but not 43 in the period of several months. From reports it seems to be 5600 of dead terrorists vs 4430 of killed soldiers on my side in total. 


My source is what joint forces post during the ceasefire. I’m not close enough to inside information. And ratio is mostly in our favor during these times cause the local heros can’t go a day without pulling dumb shit and getting themselves killed. 

So I imagine Russian military bases on the Border aren’t there accidentally, and after constitution referendum shenanigans and rotation folks will come back. 

But yeah civilians are just tired of that shit and will jump into the hands of Ukrainian Army. You stop deluding yourself after living 6 years in a nightmare. Let’s be honest, Russia doesn’t need them just like they don’t need Transnistria, Abkhasia or South Ossetia.

""The Treasury will not review its plans to approve the Google tax on digital services despite threats from the U.S. government. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has sent a letter to the finance ministers of Spain, the UK, France and Italy informing them that negotiations with these countries on the tax have reached an ""impasse"". Mnuchin warns in the letter that ""if countries choose to levy or adopt these taxes, the US will respond with proportionally appropriate measures"", as the Financial Times has reported and ABC has confirmed.

&amp;#x200B;

Finance sources say that despite the letter from the Trump Administration, the Ministry will continue with its intention to unilaterally approve the tax. The so-called ""Google tax"" is now in the Congress of Deputies, where the parliamentary groups are presenting their partial amendments after the Lower House agreed to continue with its processing and reject the total amendments presented by PP, Vox and Citizens. Despite the fact that the European Union wants to design a continental tax to strengthen the EU budget, the Executive is seeking to increase the pressure on Europe by approving it on its own and collecting 968 million a year.

&amp;#x200B;

""Trying to rush these difficult negotiations is a distraction from much more important issues,"" the letter states. Mnuchin wants to resume negotiations later, when the pandemic is over. This would leave in the air the debate to approve the tax in the countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), of which the United States is a member, and which sought to reach an agreement before the end of next year. In fact, the letter notes that Donald Trump's government is opposed to negotiating the introduction of this tax at the international level. ""The U.S. continues to oppose digital taxes and other such unilateral measures,"" says the Treasury Secretary.

&amp;#x200B;

The pressure's not new. The US announced a few weeks ago that it would open a file to countries considering passing similar taxes. Along with Spain, the European Union itself, Italy, India, Austria, Brazil, the Czech Republic and the United Kingdom are on the list of countries being investigated by the U.S. Department of Commerce for proposing similar taxes and on which it could approve tariffs or similar measures, the U.S. Department of Commerce revealed at the time.

&amp;#x200B;

At the last Forum in Davos, for example, the US Government threatened the UK with tariffs on British cars if it approved the tax. At this same summit, France froze its tax project in the face of pressure from the United States, which sees a tax that would tax the technology giants, with Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google in first place, as a provocation.

&amp;#x200B;

The IRS was planning to leave the collection of the Google tax until the last quarter. The idea of the Executive is to adapt the tax if there is finally an international agreement in the EU or the OECD. The tax, at a rate of 3%, will be levied on digital online advertising services, on intermediation services that allow other users to be located and interact with them, and on the transmission of data collected from users. According to the Treasury's project, it will affect multinationals with a turnover of more than 750 million euros worldwide and more than three million euros in Spain, which excludes companies such as Cabify, Mercadona or Inditex, but it does affect Uber or Telefónica.""",,/r/europe/comments/hb2han/usa_threatens_spain_for_the_google_tax/fv6bt2z/,SoloJinxOnly,1592435494

4287,"&gt;In the end the EU knows very well that the economic disadvantages of “no deal” for the EU will be manageable but for the UK will be disastrous – to the point where the government will likely fall and their successors will agree to the EU’s terms anyway. So why give in now?

Probably because that is a misreading of the impact of a no-deal exit. If the UK leaves with no deal, it will take an economic hit, but it won't topple the government, moreover absent the transition, the benefits of an EU deal drop off and become less urgent not more. Not to mention that as long as the UK and EU do not have a deal in place, UK firms, consumers will drift away (the added cost of trade barriers) and EU firms and customers will do the same. The result is less interdependence and a loss of leverage for the EU relative to now. Oh and that's before we get to the bit where the UK government blames the EU, the EU blames the UK and public trust is eroded further.

The UK leaving with a deal in place makes it more likely that the UK and EU build on that going forward, with no-deal, the UK isn't going to come back and agree to the EU's terms. They won't be able to, it'd be politically impossible and becomes less viable and necessary over time anyway (not to mention that the terms of the EU agreement at present are arguably more damaging than no agreement at all..).",United Kingdom - Personally vouched for by /u/colourfox,/r/europe/comments/hapugm/amid_brexit_impasse_germany_urges_nodeal/fv6cvbh/,-ah,1592436072

&gt;The withdrawal from all the various amputated areas from Karelia in the south to the Ryabachi Peninsula in the far north, which altogether comprised over 10 percent of Finland's land mass, had to be completed within twelve days.  Under the terms of the treaty, the populace of the sundered lands was given the right to decide whether they wished to leave their homes and depart or remain.  Virtually all chose to leave.

4323,"&gt;No, when you invoked animals regarding natural law.

It occurs in nature. What would you consider natural? 

&gt;Countless Christain writers, Popes, Saints, etc, have written on the nature of the Old Testament

What is your point? It still states what I said, and it states it very unambiguously. 

&gt;Your sole purpose appears to be to rage, and you use bad arguments to justify it.

Claims the person who wants to forcefully remove a mentally disabled child from the only person that ever made her happy because of his sexual orientation. Keeping in mind many ""correct"" families could not be bothered with doing what he's doing. 

&gt;omg why isn't a massive international organization omnisciently powerful, and equipped with non-human anti-corruption measures no governmental body could dream of having????????? Setting up impossible demands is a cool way to mentally masturbate.

They should have had at least the bare minimum mechanisms in place. Also people very high up in the church were covering this up. Let's not pretend it was a few bad actors. This was very much known to the Vatican and was covered up and facilitated at every level of the church. 

On top of that, companies and governments do not claim to have an all powerful being backing them up. It's probably why they have compliance and internal audit/investigation departments.

&gt; wow so brave

Disliking organizations that facilitate child rape has nothing to do with bravery. Most functioning human beings agree. 

&gt;No

Yes

&gt;You don't see it because you're hopelessly lazy &amp; prefer non-arguments on topics you know nothing about. Just remember this all started because you quoted a OT passage Christians have never followed

And I've asked and you've ignored, why did your God previously demand you murder your daughter if she didn't bleed after being forced into marriage and demand you stone your son for being drunk?

what you have read is wrong.

here is a link video is in English where our prime minister talks about the Swedish strategy and denies that the Swedish strategy involves herd immunity.

[https://www.expressen.se/tv/nyheter/coronaviruset/har-pressas-lofven-av-utlandska-journalister-om-corona/](https://www.expressen.se/tv/nyheter/coronaviruset/har-pressas-lofven-av-utlandska-journalister-om-corona/)

and here is another link in Swedish where FHM the Swedish national health authority also denies that herd immunity is the strategy. 

[https://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/a/wPqG7d/folkhalsomyndigheten-om-flockimmunitet-inte-var-strategi](https://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/a/wPqG7d/folkhalsomyndigheten-om-flockimmunitet-inte-var-strategi)

translated form Swedish

&gt; But at the National Health Authority's daily press conference, Sara Byfors, head of laboratory of bacterial surveillance, states that the Swedish strategy has never been to achieve herd immunity, but instead is to slow down the spread of infection.  - Herd immunity is not something we strive for, but it is a fact that the more people who have had the disease, the fewer can spread it.  When asked how the Public Health Authority responds to the information in the debate article, Sara Byfors says that the criticism is difficult to respond to:  - Our strategy is not herd immunity but to slow down the spread of infection and protect the vulnerable groups. There is not much more to say about it. Their assessment may stand for them, but that is not our strategy. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; How did they plan to protect the people at risk if they weren't controlling it in any way? 

 The idea that Sweden does not have any restrictions is also wrong we have restrictions but they are softer. sure they might not have been harsh enough to protect the elderly we don't know the exact reason for the total failure there.  I don't want to argue about if the Swedish strategy is right or wrong. you can criticises it all you want i am just telling you what the actual Swedish strategy is. which is to have restrictions that both stop hospitals from being overwhelmed and is sustainable for a long time and to protect the at risk population.",,/r/europe/comments/hamvfg/map_of_infections_per_100000_inhabitants_during/fv5xy1r/,ertle0n,1592428278

4443,"As a German living near the border to the Netherlands: Very common.

It is just normal to do that. I myself do it mostly on holidays. When the shops are closed in Germany and I see that I forgot to buy something I go to the Netherlands to buy what I need. Nevertheless, there are many who do their weekly shopping in the Netherlands. (Which is mostly a ""traditional thing"" I guess, prices are not that different, however, a decade or two ago coffee was extremely cheap compared to Germany. Thus ""coffee-shopping"" was done in the Netherlands and now everyone just continues to go shopping there.

&amp;#x200B;

For myself: Cinema is the most important reason to go. In Germany, every movie is dubbed and while German synchronization is generally very good, I like to watch English movies in English.

Other reasons, the nearest Games Workshop is in a Dutch city near where I live.

There is a really beautiful zoo, it is not really near (1 to 2h drive), but it is really beautiful. (Burger's Zoo Arnheim, if anyone wants to know.)

Dutch fries are great if you know where to get them.

There is a nice lake about 30 minutes from where I live, guess what it is in the Netherlands.

There is a second lake which is directly at the border but a little bit further away... I think... perhaps I am wrong.

A friend of mine lives so close to the Netherlands that going for a walk in the forest behind his house leaves you uncertain if or when you have crossed the border. (I admit that this is most likely not important if we talk about spreading the virus.)

&amp;#x200B;

In short: The border between Germany and the Netherlands is, at least where I live, a very blurry line. If it wasn't for the language one wouldn't notice. (And in the end, dutch people are mostly speaking a strange kind of Low German.

And fresh fish is the most in demand of the lot. The EU states cannot source more fresh fish to replace the catch lost from the UK's EEZ as there is no more resources near them. They could fly it in from other countries, but that increases the costs dramatically (and because they were buying elsewhere would increase the price there as well). Those cost increases are far more than any tariffs they could apply to the UK's fish (WTO rules see to that). So the net result would be European consumers either accepting vastly higher fresh fish costs or accepting a (still expensive) poorer substitute in frozen fish from elsewhere.

The UK on the other hand could just fish the species that it wants to and leave the rest of the fish in the water, rebuilding its own fisheries from the years of neglect. It would cot them little to do this as EU boats fishing on EU (not UK) quotas were taking over 60% of the UK's catch anyway.

It's a shame some innocent unfortunate civilians died during the cleansing of these groups. But Turkey alone cannot be held guilty for it.

I stand by my WW2 comparison,as it is literally correct that Allies did kill civilians,but that does not mean they are bad guys.

Allies in WW2,USA in war on terror,Turkey on PKK all arguably commited crimes,but that does not make them bad guys and the opposing side good guys.

There is no compromise with territorial integrity.You are probably less then 16 years old if you think otherwise,which makes my argument with you pointless.

No. Because we recognize that they are part of a different ethnicity, that they were there before Italy was even a thing, and we gave them a great degree of independence... So they don't have to rebel... Go figure! Way to prove my point?

We love them! They used to kidnap some celebrities back in the day from time to time but then that stopped. They do their own thing mostly.

I don't know how the UK-EU FTA negotiations work internally on the EU side, but I'm skeptical that changing the Council presidency is likely to dramatically alter EU positions.

4964,"&gt;I still don't see any strategic profit for Russia from this war. Everything stayed the same. What is the profit for Russia?

Before the war, they didn't control that Gori tunnel and territory near the gas pipes (also very important infrastructure object in the region) that went into Georgia from the north. After the war, they did. 

It also means that after the war, Russian military is in such a position that in case of another possible war they can immediately invade Georgia without any physical barriers in the way, as that tunnel is the only real road from which you can move a army from Russia controlled North Caucasus across the mountains into Georgia itself. It essentially cleared the way for any future invasion down south of Russia if so desires and gave Russia complete control over the mountains that previosly served as physical barrier between Russia and Georgia

Also it is an immensely powerful political pressure mechanism now that Russia can use to make Georgia do what it wants, since Russian army being stationed there makes Georgian overall defense far less possible, so they can say ''Georgians do as we say, or we send more troops to be stationed inside Abkhazia and South Ossetia'' 

&gt;This is maybe a military intelligence work.

more like it was all pre-planned well in advance, you don't improvise big army group movements out of nowhere. Just like capture of Crimea was not spontaneous or random, such military operations can only happen with planning well in advance

5026,"This is what pisses me off, people keep talking about ""multiculturalism"" and ""diversity"" being great things, wanting to ""celebrate"" those things etc. when they've never been good historically speaking.

""Diversity"" of some kind is basically behind every conflict you can think of. Discrimination, ""them vs. us"" mentality, so-called hate crimes, riots, revolutions, civil wars, ""normal"" wars, ethnic cleansing, genocides etc. etc. It's all down to some sort of diversity. Diversity of ethnicity, religion, culture, politics, ideology or whatever. When has it ever been a strength anywhere? Even the differences between Catholicism and Protestantism have caused wars and other problems, Sunni vs. Shia is another obvious example, objectively speaking the ""diversity"" is very limited in those cases but it's clearly more than enough to cause nothing but problems.

And sure, cultures have always influenced each other etc. which can be both good and bad depending on the specific examples, but it hasn't been done by one culture just letting large groups of another culture into their country. When it has worked out, it's been neighboring countries influencing each other, working together etc. over a long time. 

At best diversity and multiculturalism has worked ""fairly well"" and been ""relatively peaceful"", at worst it has caused open wars and genocides. The idea that it's something to strive for is just plain ridiculous. Obviously it also varies depending on the cultures you intend to ""mix"" as some are more similar than others, some are less political than others, some are more peaceful than others etc. but even in those cases I don't really see what the big upside has been. Why is something working ""okay"" or something ""not causing wars"" viewed as such a massively positive thing? That seems like a pretty fucking low bar to set I'd say.

I simply do not understand where people get the idea that those are such positive things from. Historically speaking it's been a disaster whenever it's been tried. It's one of the reasons why countries and empires have failed as well for that matter. People who are really different don't tend to want the same things, value the same things, don't see others as part of their ""us"" group. It has caused one group to be looked down on by the others, one group to be discriminated against by the others etc. every fucking time.",Denmark,/r/europe/comments/h9yer1/dijon_police_brought_in_to_tackle_chechen_violence/fv3mget/,Dnarg,1592377705

About a year or two ago we passed an interesting threshold, more than half of the planet’s economic/industrial resources were under the control of authoritarian governments. 

The world is becoming more authoritarian, not less. This is hardy unprecedented; authoritarians throughout history have helped their fellow authoritarians -Kings helping other Kings suppress peasant uprisings, military dictatorships helping other military dictatorships train their internal security forces, and so on- and you can already see the infestation in the heart of Europe. Berlusconi, Orban, Johnson, and Zeman are just a few names that immediately spring to mind.

Communist rule demonstrated the power of the authoritarian rule to destroy what you call a culture of civilization. Once authoritarians take control and lift the veil, it isn’t a serious obstacle to eradicate the concept of liberalism from the public consciousness.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/had75m/europe_must_stand_up_to_china_before_its_too_late/fv3mxtu/,Kahzootoh,1592378150

5062,"You hit the nail on the coffin of why EU can not stand up to China. Key phrase is ""individual countries"". EU is nothing else but 3 dozen of individual countries with personal agenda and if by any chance it is 100% common then they might do something together. 


America works because everyone who goes to live there is and considers himself American. If you are Irish in America then you call yourself Irish American. But you are still American and you are united under one flag and common values. In Europe people do not thing like that. Individual countries are driven by nationalism and exceptionalism and there is no European identity. 


On top of that just like I mentioned different countries have different agenda. While France does not have problem to call China on their bullshit you may have noticed that Germany does. Merkel in all her interviews acted like snake dodging all snarky questions about HK and even lowkey criticized UK for their stance on HK and citizenship offer for Hong Kongers. Why? Because VW has majority of sales in China nowadays and Germany economy is built upon that company. So Germany is up to ankles in China's ass. They do not publicly support China in what it does but they also never say anything about it.


Another problems are weak leaders not unlike those that were in Europe in 30s and appeased Hitler. If US did not exist and Putin invaded Ukraine and Baltic states tommorow then what would happen? Leaders of EU countries would make all the excuses why they can not help and national identity would justify it to people. Why should Polish go and die for Ukranians, why should Germans die for Estonians, why should French die for Germans? European countries do not care until it starts being their own business and endangers their own agenda.


TL.DR: Europe is toothless institution with no ability to project force or to protect its members. Because there is no common identity, because nationalism in individual countries is strong and because every member has their own agenda and on top that all leaders are either clowns or weaklings who will appease until the last possible moment.",,/r/europe/comments/had75m/europe_must_stand_up_to_china_before_its_too_late/fv3n0yh/,IamWildlamb,1592378230

Key word here. Relative to its size and population. That’s why comparing absolute values is a waste of time. I can pretty much guarantee you’ve consumed some kind of Irish food product, wherever in Europe you live.

If you EVER want to change capitalism, you need to attack its flaws violently, if not, you get more of the nothing we have today. Also: S-S-STRAWMAAAAANNN!

”Dont you think youre exaggerating...”
 No. If I ”choose” to live in poverty, I die homeless and starving.
The only choice I have in a capitalist society if Im not born into a wealthy family, is slave away for breadcrumbs while the top hoards in the profit from my work, or lie down and rot.
Thats not a choice, thats glorified slavery.
And Its fine for people to pursue their dreams. But not at the expense of others.
And if your dream is to hoard as much wealth as possible, it will be at the expense of everyone.


”Which is what many northern...”
I know, I live in one of them. The only way its a somewhat more decent place to live than say america, is thanks to the mix of socialism and capitalism aka social democracy. However, capitalists are attempting to dismantle every socialized infrastructure we have in favour of the private market, which is why I hate capitalists so much, because when privatized infrastructure fails, the top in that infrastructure gets bailed out, and the workers as well as users of said infrastructure suffers.
That is capitalism at its core.



”I hope you...”
lol, is your best defence against my arguments ”no u”? You know, we can own stuff and still criticize the system in which they are created when we dont have an alternative to them?
We can demand from the companies who make our shit to pay fair fucking wages to their workers as they would be paid in our own countries, we can demand that they pay their taxes to keep society functional. You do realize you dont have to bend over and say ”Im ready jeff, please be gentle”?

Yeah I'm not going to continue to debate someone who thinks that violent revolution is legitimate participation in politics in Western Europe. You are simply incredibly detached from reality if you seriously believe in that in one of the richest and most equal countries on earth.

You were the one engaging in a personal attack against me while probably being incredibly hypocritical.

&gt;However, capitalists are attempting to dismantle every socialized infrastructure we have in favour of the private market, which is why I hate capitalists so much, because when privatized infrastructure fails, the top in that infrastructure gets bailed out, and the workers as well as users of said infrastructure suffers. That is capitalism at its core.

Not to mention that you capitalists love highlighting that the living conditions in china have improved. Here’s 2 questions:


How many people in china have had to suffer from being exploited by our countries?


And dont you think their living conditions would have improved significantly more if we would have paid them, gee I dunno, fair wages instead of exploiting them?


Get out of your fucking echo chamber. Maybe you’re upset by me calling you a bootlicker, but thats because of your inability to criticize a system for all the flaws it has. Because doing so would be inconvenient for you.

5244,"&gt; Pedophila is rape not sex

*Pedophilia* is a condition wherein the person who has it is attracted to prepubescent children. You mean to say sex with children is rape. Yes, it is. 

&gt; In sexual encounter participate two equal persons they both consent 

Yes. Sex requires consent to not be rape, minors cannot offer consent. Ergo sex with minors is rape. We actually have pretty good laws on this everywhere in Europe... mostly... 

I kind of feel like the minimum age of consent in some places is way too low, at least when large differences are involved. There's just no way a 15 year old (which is the consent age in a lot of countries, including mine and yours btw)  is in an 'equal' relationship with a 40 year old. 

If it were up to me I'd leave the ages as is but for under 18s institute some maximum age difference of only a few years, so if you're 15 and your partner is say 18, it could be legal, but no fucking way some 40yo is in a healthy relationship with a 15yo and that shouldn't be legal. Bu that's another story. 

&gt; in pedophilia one person suffers terrible lifelong trauma 

This is why it's all the more important that we have a better understanding of pedophilia, what causes it, what medical treatments offer results and what (if any) non-medical therapies prevent them from acting out on their thoughts. 

And if that makes people uncomfortable, too bad. Their discomfort is a tiny tiny price to pay if it means fewer raped children. 

&gt; Fighting pedophilia is exactly like fighting potential rapists it must includes therapy and should NOT include attempt to promote them  as natural behaviour or a sexual orientation. 

The video does not promote them, it explains how there's currently a lack of solutions for such people. If someone is a pedophile, and they want to suppress their urges and live as normal a life as possible, where can they go to get help? 

The further you push these people to the edges of society, the more likely it is they'll act out on their urges. 

And if you cannot find it in you to sympathize with someone with such an illness, then you can sympathize with their potential victims. Not helping them means it's more likely those victims will become a reality.  

Also, yes it is natural. I'm just going to say it in all caps to be clear for everyone: **NATURAL THINGS AREN'T ALWAYS GOOD.** 

It's as natural as fucking polio. We made a vaccine for polio because even though it was natural, we really didn't like children getting polio. Unfortunately, the human brain is pretty complicated and we don't really know yet how to permanently fix disorders like this or if that's even possible. 

&gt; at least in my country where foreign western values have not advanced enough.

You're being really emotional. This does not help anyone. If you want fewer children to be harmed then you will be in favor of research for therapies, treatment and preventative measures for pedophiles.",Romania,/r/europe/comments/ha0fgu/berlin_authorities_placed_children_with/fv37axc/,Relnor,1592366064

5322,"China spent four years fighting for market-economy status, a designation that would give it stronger footing with commercial partners while also curtailing their ability to retaliate over trade disputes.

This week, China quietly lost that battle.


The Chinese government allowed a landmark World Trade Organization dispute -- aimed at forcing the European Union to recognize it as a market economy in trade investigations -- to lapse on June 15. The case was initially brought in 2016 and China lost an interim ruling on the matter last year.

By ending the dispute China now provides the EU with greater legal certainty to combat low-price Chinese exports with artificially high tariffs.

The resolution is a major set-back for China as the EU steps up efforts to limit its expansionist practices into the continent. On the same day that China allowed the dispute to lapse, the EU announced an unprecedented attempt to block Beijing’s subsidies to exporters. The 27-nation bloc will also unveil a proposal this week to protect European companies from Chinese takeovers.


The EU, Chinese and U.S. missions to the WTO didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

U.S. Dispute

The move also bodes well for the U.S., which is engaged in a nearly identical Chinese dispute that U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer previously called the WTO’s “most serious litigation.”

China decided to drop the matter after the WTO, in an interim ruling, rejected the argument that Beijing’s 2001 agreement to join the WTO automatically granted it the right to be treated as market economy in anti-dumping investigations after 15 years.


The ruling, which still not been made public, said the EU could continue to impose higher duties on under-priced -- or “dumped” -- Chinese imports on a case-by-case basis, according to sources familiar with the case.

The U.S. and EU don’t consider Chinese prices reliable, and for decades they have calculated Chinese anti-dumping duties in ways that disregard Chinese costs and prices in favor of data from third countries that adhere to free-market forces. That’s allowed them to add extra duties to Chinese imports that help keep their domestic producers competitive.

China filed the dispute in 2016 and argued that the legal basis that permitted the EU to deviate from standard WTO anti-dumping practices expired in 2016 -- the 15th anniversary of China’s accession to the WTO.


China temporarily suspended the dispute after the WTO issued its interim report in 2019, which prevented the ruling from going public. Beijing declined to restart the dispute before the deadline to do so expired on June 15",,/r/europe/comments/hah615/china_loses_landmark_wto_dispute_against_eu/fv2s2w0/,FirstAmount0,1592356815

After all these years going around, I also came to realize what you have put into a beautiful little paragraph.

Growing up I felt constricted in my quaint surroundings where I felt nothing really interesting could happen, just the same routine all over.

For the first years abroad I felt like the saying “there’s no place like home” rang hollow, my home was the whole world! While would I confine myself to a boring place?

Yet after all these years, I find myself longing for home indeed.

Turns out life is usually a routine regardless of where you are, just a different one. Over time every place for amazing as it is, becomes dull and repetitive to us.

Learning to appreciate the moment and what you have around is important.

&gt;A first alert was given in February 2013. Marseille's criminal police intercepted a go-fast - a large engine used to transport drugs - near Chateauneuf-les-Martigues.

I use capitalist as a slur because it’s an inherently fucked system that will always seek to maximize profit for the few through exploitation at the expense of the poor. And by not admitting that this is the fucking problem, you and your entitled ass is contributing to its continued existance.
In capitalism, money is power, and in capitalism, you’re groomed to desire hoarding that power to make your dreams come true.

The only way for capitalism to work, is if it’s heavily regulated and progressively taxed, in any other scenario the wealth will inevitably be concentrated at the unelected ”top in society”, who can then use that wealth to control the lower classes.

And now back to your so called ”point”.
You dont have one. World leaders today are complaining about a state whos economy grew (while still keeping its populace poor as fuck) simply by playing by their own rules.
China said: here is tons of cheap labour.
We said: neato!

5402,"&gt; Did Sweden play a role in aiding the resistance movement in Norway in any way?

The official policy of Sweden was Neutrality: In the first part of the war, this was strongly bowing to Germany, while after Stalingrad you see more cooperation with the Norwegian government-in-exile in London.

In the first part of the war this meant that Norwegian resistance members fleeing to Sweden not only had to get over the border but also hide when passing trough police districts in Sweden there the local chief of police might be leaning toward the nazis. (Or interpreting the relative lack of official orders, such that they should return Norwegian resistance back into the arms of the nazis.)

In the later part of the war, the Norwegian refugee community was larger, and helping new people over, and Sweden gave it's OK to the Norwegian government in exile financing training police troops in Sweden.  (Officially police but really rather military troops who would go into Norway after the German capitulation, and round up German soldiers, now POWs...)

The Norwegian refugee community in Sweden was largely resistance members and their families, and would naturally smuggle weapons, radios and intelligence reports over the border.  But also collect aid to civilians in Norway, work with organizations like the Red Cross, give information on and work for inspections on prison camps in Norway, and lobby in Sweden in favor of a more pro-Norwegian stance.

If you were a resistance member in Norway, and someone who knew you were arrested by the Nazis, you essentially has a few days to get away, hoping they would hold up so long under torture. There were fishing vessels taking people to Shetland under the cover of night, and there were people dedicated to guiding people on foot, at night in a several days log trek, over the border to Sweden.  (Crossing the border to Finland was a no go since northern Finland had more German soldiers than Finnish officials.)  But you would have to know someone who know someone who can smuggle you out, and with all travel restricted, and the border region under total lockdown, it's not an easy feat.

&gt; What about aid rendered to Finland?

There were volunteers and many private initiatives for all kind of aid during the winter war.  But no official involvement of soldiers, or weapons. (Maybe Food/Medicines?) 

At the time of the invasion of Norway, the winter war was over. A train of Finnish refugees returning to Finland got caught up in the fighting, with causualties. (So refugees from Finland had been temporary housed.)",,/r/europe/comments/ha0sy3/a_swedish_soldier_and_norwegian_resistance_member/fv2ditx/,gormhornbori,1592348523

5452,"&gt; Yeah, as long as the trust in the US dollar is there then sure, but that's not gonna last forever if the US continues to behave like this.

At some point, I'm sure countries will want to move away from the US. In order to do that however there has to be an alternative and none exists. Hell, even european countries trade in USD even thought the euro exists. So for the foreseeable future, its a non point.

&gt; Again, the biggest leverage the US has over the world is US dollar which is based on the trust in the US as a trading partner and back to my main point.

Again, this is simply incorrect. The USD's position as the global reserve its due to the USA being economically large, stable, powerful and not intervening in currency markets(unlike China).

&gt; I know it's not gonna happen quickly but if the US continues to behave in the same manner then it will only be a matter of time.

They need an alternative first and none exist. So for now, it won't happen.

&gt; It's the other way around; the US is the worlds largest economy, military and consumer BECAUSE of the USD domination which came to be after WW2 and the Bretton Woods.

The US was the world's largest economy before World War 1 which is obviously before Bretton Woods or WW2. So those 2 points are moot. The USA's economy is the largest because it has the resources of a continent to itself, political stability and rule of law. Only Europe also has this, but Europe is also horribly divided with terrible demographics. Were the Europeans united and with positive demographics, it would be bigger than the US no doubt. But that's not happening anytime soon sadly. Unless the germans find a way to make 20 somethings to consume those cars of theirs.

&gt; 
&gt; I can just easily find an article that says the opposite.

The article actually says ""we have no idea, it's very very complicated and we don't know nearly enough to make an informed prediction"", rather than the opposite. The most optimistic they can be is ""some soils are degrading faster than others"". That still means a reduction in agricultural area.

&gt;Phosphates arnt a problem so long as there not overused. They've being used since 1880 and they haven't destroyed the land yet. And we have over 80 years before they run out wich means we have enough time to replace it or find more.

Phosphate deposits are a nonrenewable resource, and plants use P in their basic chemistry, nothing is going to change there. So once the deposits start running out, yields start to drop again. Theoretically it's possible to recuperate them through sewage recuperation, but that's so far still... theoretical. It would require quite a lot of infrastructure and political effort to get that in place, and then it's still really opaque what the extra costs of that recuperation would do to the price levels of food, with all consequences that come with that.

&gt;You don't decrease population to deal with climate change you need to change the way produce energy and travel.

And what makes you think a solution on that front is both guaranteed to pop up and be easier than aiming for a lower population?

&gt;Europe's population has increased but emissions have decreased over the last few decades.

Mostly due to offshoring emissions to foreign countries. There's some progress, but we've only touched the surface so far. And the hardest things are yet to come; electricity was just the warming up, now there's heating, transport fuel and all the industrial processes.

&gt;It's called crop rotation, fertiliser and irrigation. We've being doing it since 1600s. If you think soil isn't renewable then you fundamentally do not understand agriculture.

Fertilizer usually is a nonrenewable input. Crop rotation is often ignored and compensated somewhat with fertilizer, which increases the erosion losses due to the constant overexploitation and the general coverless state of the land. We've had erosion losses since the 1600s, and that got worse, not better, with the introduction of heavy agricultural machinery.

And no, soil isn't renewable in a meaningful timescale to us. Soil that is washed away ends up in rivers and eventually on the continental shelf where it's deposited in a delta. This removes both nutrients and the soil medium from the ecological cycle. Replacing nutrients costs fertilizer, which just means the nonrenewable resource we use for that deplete even faster, and if we ever have to replace the soil medium that effectively means grinding rocks to dust. This obviously is prohibitively expensive.

&gt;No already exsisting tech(such as public transport, electrical cars, renewables and nuclear) will replace worse already exsisting tech(like oil and diesel cars).

Transport is about 20%, so assuming you wave your magic wand that still leaves heating and industrial uses. We have a shot at reaching a stable situation while retaining most industrial benefits, but it's not like the plans are already lying on the shelf, presigned by all stakeholders, so we just pick our moment to set them in motion. No, the big changes still have to come, that means there will be losers and winners, and the losers who are now powerful will oppose those plans. And there are uncertainties about how to achieve things technically still, so we do need time for that too. It's not too early to start.

And it's not something we can do at our leisure. While the ecology spends time in a state of overheating/overexposure to CO2, we suffer ecological degradation and climate problems which also reduces agricultural productivity, if only through droughts, but also through plagues which result from ecological imbalances.

&gt;Or quotas can just be improved, and consumption of fish decreased.

They should have been ""improved"" and consumption decreased a long time ago to give historically low stocks the chance to recover, but they don't.

By the time the millenials (° around 1990) reach pension age, 2060, that peak of boomer dependency is 20 years in the past. And where pensions aren't capitalized, there will be slack to increase them, even if they were decreased (because a pension decrease hasn't happened anywhere yet). Do also keep in mind that there will be an influx of inheritances from boomers.

It's very weird that people fear that pensions are like some kind of piggy bank that can be used up so there will be nothing left when its their turn, and those people usually propose capitalization as a way to prevent that. But it's precisely capitalized pensions that can be used up, while repartition pensions can be flexibly adjusted according to the slack there is at the moment. 

Capitalization is also more vulnerable to economic happenstance, and does not protect against generational imbalances: the extra demand by all those pensioners with their big money will also make other products more  expensive.

One of the defendants, Tariq Mehmood,  defended himself in court, and along with the other defence lawyers  they laid bare mass police negligence with regards to defending Asian  and Afro-Caribbean communities from racist attacks. The not guilty  verdicts effectively established the rights of Black and Asian  communities to self-defence.   
The trial also saw a nationwide  campaign for the activists' release with their comrades declaring ""The  politicians and police have failed us. Our youth are our only  protection. \[...\] Now they have been taken away from us. We must not  fail them. We must fight to bring them back. They have defended our  community. We must now defend them.""  At that time in Britain,  racists considered all people of colour as ""Black"", so Afro-Caribbean,  Asian and other activists of colour formed the idea of ""political  Blackness"" to try to build unity against racism.

5570,"Because it's not a ""crimes are now forgiven"" limit but an ""at some point, after a lot of time, there is no realistic way to have any kind of evidence-based trial"" limit. Even at age 40, which means that any such crime took place more than 20 years earlier, it's pretty much impossible to find any kind of physical evidence for this kind of crime unless it was specifically secured and preserved at the time (in which case there's usually already been a trial). As far as witnesses go, *most* child molesters don't molest children in front of other people, so unless it's a case of someone else definitely knowing about it and not going to the police (and therefore being some level of accomplice, hence probably not very interested in prosecution), you have little or no witness statements that can't be explained through normal, completely non-sexual interactions.

Once you move past ""I definitely saw this happen"" into much more muddy waters like ""I saw X and Y naked once or twice but there was nothing obviously sexual going on"" and add in decades of natural memory decay, it's almost guaranteed at that point that the entire trial becomes a case of ""s/he said, s/he said"", which in any fair justice system simply isn't enough to convict people of a crime you can't prove.",,/r/europe/comments/ha0fgu/berlin_authorities_placed_children_with/fv21rtn/,Flamin_Jesus,1592342544

IMO we follow a model for a federation but without the system for it. If we really were a United States of Europe it would be much better having every country being specialized in a certain area. Germany would be the California of Europe and I guess we would be fucking Florida or some other poor state with only tourism.

5626," &gt;1. Luxembourg gets more than it pays because of the EU institutions here. That money doesn't actually end up in our budget, but is used to pay for our common expenses.

Literally no EU money ends up in a country’s budget. The EU doesn’t hand out money to governments to do whatever with it, the EU finances projects. That money is still a massive benefit for your country. Most of the officials from those institutions aren’t Luxemburgish, true, but what about the staff? A lot of jobs created by the EU. Also local businesses, I mean all those officials and diplomats have to eat and drink somewhere, have to dleep somewhere and I imagine they aren’t eating at McDonald’s and sleeping at a cheap motel. 

&gt;	Just because your country pays more, doesn’t mean they don’t massively profit. Because that money doesn’t go to nothing. Say Poland gets money to build a road. Likely, there will be companies from all over Europe involved in this. In the end Poland gets a road and European companies get money, thus providing jobs. After the road is built, perhaps there will be factories, where German or French companies can cheaply produce stuff and thus stay competitive. Imagine the EU as a very large New Deal administration akin to what America did prior to WW2. International economy is not a zero-sum game with one winner and one loser.

That’s true, however I would add that these benefits generally end up in the pockets of the few. If say the EU finances a road in Poland amd that road is built by Strabag (an Austrian company), it’s not like your average Austrian will have a benefit from this, yes the EU is awesome for the 1% in rich countries, but not really helpful for the 99%.

5795,"If you really believe Sweden was in a position to ""standing up for principles"", I would suggest studying the geopolitics and the demands and threats from both the allies, soviets and axis beforehand, without fully understanding the actual geopolitics of that time you miss a huge amount of reasons why Sweden were forced into a position that were far away from their actual ideals and principles at the time. Swedish public and newspapers together with their western counterparts expressed this problematic scenario all throughout the war, maintaining principles of total neutrality and sovereignty was deemed a certain death and that's fully understandable, so they did the least worst thing that would achieve full independence as a Swedish state, which in this case was to continue trade with Germany and some minor concessions (many western countries argued that Sweden were a little too accommodating with Germany, but no one understanding the situation blame their stance and actions), a far better deal than what the Allies realistically could offer. Alignment with the Soviets was definitely out of question, especially since Sweden's unofficial support of Finland and reluctance to give in with Soviet demands in the winter war made Soviet-Swedish relations even worse than before.

Germany would have gotten its Swedish iron ore no matter if they were at war/neutral/allied, the German war machine was dependent on Swedish iron ore as it at times almost amounted to half of all iron going to German industries, this is readily available information from German intelligence and invasion plans of Scandinavia, a stop in the iron ore supply would've directed all German attention to Sweden, where the allies admittedly could not assist with any valuable help or defense, as the position of Sweden is even worse off than Norway's (which evidently got the short end of the stick with help from the Allies)

If Sweden ""took a stance"" by either aligning themselves with the Allies or just severing the ties with Nazi Germany, it would have starved out all Swedish citizens and the economy as they no longer could feed or sustain themselves because of the massive ongoing trade Sweden and Germany already had since before, and that the Germans wouldn't allow any Swedish trade passing through their territories, resulting in Sweden being completely isolated from the world without food or vital imports. Famine and total collapse of important institutions is certain if some form of trade couldn't be achieved. 

Swedish defense at the outbreak of the war was in very poor conditions, declaring anything other than neutrality in that position could only be described as foolish, and anyone arguing anything else should look up the equipment and capacity of both Sweden and Germany, if the iron ores were at stakes Germany wouldn't have blinked twice on invading at a relatively meager cost.

Also, you can't forget how much lives were spared due to Sweden being a neutral country taking in tons of refugees from all its direct neighbors. So it's not only Swedish lives we're talking about, we can't forget that Sweden were the only place targeted minorities in Northern Europe could seek refuge in at the time. Giving up that position would inevitably resulted in a massive death toll for the minorities who fled the Baltics and rest of the Nordic.",Værmaland ,/r/europe/comments/ha0sy3/a_swedish_soldier_and_norwegian_resistance_member/fv15rlt/,jaersk,1592327912

5800,"&gt; That's the funny thing, if the US continues to behave like this toward Europe and the rest of the world, eventually the world will decide that it's too risky to do business with the US.

As I said before, not gonna happen. Money talks. Does anyone like Saudi Arabia? And yet, everyone does business with them.

&gt; What?? EU is the second biggest economy in the world, if you include other non-EU countries, it's the biggest.

EU is economically, an export led union. Prosperous european countries are high savings low consumption export led growth economies(see Germany). As any business person knows, you never piss of your customer. In the case of Europe, the US is the main customer. Thats just the nature of the economics. Size or not, Europe has little leverage over the US, while the US has a ton due to the nature of their economic systems.

Not that I like this mind you.

&gt; That's not gonna last forever and the way things are going in the us domestically right now, I don't see it's lasting more than 20 years at this rate.

Its not gonna last forever but I find it difficult to image the American system falling that quickly. This isn't the first time the US has had domestic tensions and such. Its gonna take a lot more than this to take them out.

&gt; I don't know what demographics have to do with this, but economy is such is a thing that can change very quickly.

It has everything to do with this. The EU is demographically about to turn into a new Japan, which means it will need to export like mad to maintain even its current economic state(young people consume, old people product is the simplification of this), never mind grow. The only country in the planet that has the economic size to absorb enough european exports is the US. I suppose someone might mention China, but they're also an export led economy so they're in the same position as in Europe.

&gt; BTW, trade isn't even a thing that gives the US the biggest leverage, that would be the US dollar. So, if that goes, so will the US.

The USD dominance is because the US the worlds largest economy, military and consumer whilst also being fairly economically transparent. This isn't changing any day soon so the USD is here to stay as the reserve currency for the foreseeable future.

So while no one really likes it, Europe can't live without the US, even if it wanted to. Blame the Northerners for basing their economies on export led growth.",,/r/europe/comments/h9hgg4/nord_stream_2_germany_unhappy_with_new_us/fv0mskf/,BoredAt,1592319731

5820,"&gt; German soliders invaded Norway by train through Sweden

This is completely false. The invasion of Norway occurred entirely by sea and air. **After the invasion** was completed, Germany demanded that Sweden allow the movement of German troops through Sweden to Norway. The Swedish government refused, but during the period April 16-June 10, 1940, allowed 300 German personnel and 400 tons of material to be transported while negotiations were taking place. Eventually, Sweden did allow German transports on rail, but well after the invasion.

&gt; Sweden allowed the germans to tap in to their telegraph lines that the Norwegian forces also used to coordinate their resistance, with a devastating effect

This is also completely false and perversely is exactly the opposite of what happened. Germany demanded that Sweden allow it to use telegraph lines that went through Sweden, and Sweden agreed. But it was then Sweden who tapped into those lines. The Swedish mathematician Arne Beurling and his team then broke the code of the Siemens Halske T52 encryption machine and was able to collect valuable intelligence, some of which Sweden shared with the Allies. 

&gt; The norwegian princess and children even had to ram the swedish border patrol in order to escape into Sweden, as they were refused entrance.

Sweden declared neutrality. It obviously could not provide refuge to the Norwegian government or the royal family. Also, Einar Östgaard, adjutant to the crown prince, who also was in the car, has denied the story that the border was closed.

The internees were referred to as ""guests of the nation"". The German embassy had to pay for their keep. If they were on a non-combative mission they were repatriated. While it was easy for Allied pilots to make that claim, it was not realistic for Luftwaffe pilots to make a similar claim. Towards the end of the war, the German embassy was unable to pay, so the internees had to work on local farms.

5941,"""It is known that at least 15,000 Swedes volunteered to fight alongside the Finns, with 10,000 accepted for training and 8,000 actually went to Finland in organised units before the war ended, which can be compared to the largest contributor to the International brigades, France, during the entire Spanish Civil War. In addition, a smaller number of individuals joined the Finnish army units or operated mechanical shops repairing equipment, mainly in the Swedish speaking south of Finland. The Swedish government and public also sent food, clothing, medicine, weapons and ammunition to aid the Finns during this conflict. The military aid included:[4]

135,402 rifles, 347 machine guns, 450 light machine guns with 50,013,300 rounds of small arms ammunition;
144 field guns, 100 anti-aircraft guns and 92 anti-armour guns with 301,846 shells;
300 sea mines and 500 depth charges;
17 fighter aircraft, 5 light bombers, 1 DC-2 transport aircraft turned into bomber, and 3 reconnaissance aircraft, totally comprising 1/3 of the Swedish air force at the time.""
