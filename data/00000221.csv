0,"During the Continuation War Finland briefly reconquered the territories which it had lost in the Winter War, but also some Russian territory. This is usually considered kind of shade, especially since the civilian population in these areas were put in internment camps.


 And then there were the prisoner of war camps, which were quite bad. 30% of prisoners died as a result of disease, malnutrition, bad living conditions and violence. Finland's treatment of prisoners of war was better than the Soviet Union, but a lot worse than the Western Allies.



After the war some Finns were convicted for these war crimes, and this was generally accepted in Finland. But Finland was punished most severely not for war crimes, but for attacking the Soviet Union in 1941. This was regarded as hypocritical, as the Soviet Union was not punished even though they had attacked Finland first in 1939. The Red Army had also committed a number of war crimes, like massacring Finnish civilians, but no one was ever punished for this either.

1. Are people more likely to go to Germany for work and holiday or China?

2. What language are German and Chinese student's likely to share? If it is English and the answer to Q1 is Germany then is learning Chinese really a sensible thing to do?

3. What language are students most likely to retain? I.e. which one are they most likely to learn to a higher level and then use on a more frequent basis?

4. Given India is also a growing Super Power with a larger diaspora and population than China we have to also apply the last three Qs to India too.

- _She declined to shake the hand of a male interviewer for religious reasons; She placed her hand over her heart in greeting instead._ (so it's not just a plain refusal; you have to be dumb to take offense in this situation, IMO)

- Sweden's labour court found the company was justified in demanding equal treatment for both sexes - but not in demanding that it be in the form of a handshake only. (fair enough)

- The court also disagreed with the firm's assertion that Ms Alhajeh's approach to greetings would cause a problem for effective communication as an interpreter. (fair enough)

- However the judges were divided over the case - with three supporting Ms Alhajeh's claim and two voting against. (that's also oddly satisfying for me. It's not a clear-cut thing, though I tend to agree with the court.... and I find it encouraging that the court was split on the issue, too)

57,"**Living in Berlin: Germany's Venezuela**


*Dead people don't go into the ground, birth certificates take months, every visit to the authorities is a torture: anyone who yearns for a left-wing rally movement should look at everyday life in red-red-green-ruling Berlin.*

A story from the big city. A man, writer and former physician, retired for some time, believes to have discovered discrepancies in the spokeswoman's curriculum vitae of the city government. The real estate company, for which she allegedly held a management position, is not listed in the electronic commercial register. Her studies at the Fernuni (Open University) Hagen apparently did not last six years, as she says, but rather 13 years.

The man collects his research results in a 79-page dossier, which he sends to the mayor of the city and the faction leaders of the parliamentary groups represented in the parliament. As an author, he tends to use a strong language, the speaker is referred to in his text as ""Flunkerqueen"" (fibqueen)  and ""Plappermaul"" (babblemouth). That's not very friendly. On the other hand: Compared to what people emit on the Internet, this may pass for moderate expression of opinion.

Not long after he has sent his pamphlet by post, the man receives a visit from the police. At the crack of dawn, six policemen stand in front of the door and demand access to his apartment. They confiscate computers and mobile phones as well as printers, hard drives and various USB sticks, as can be read at Stern.de, which made the case public.

*Administrative madness under Michael Müller*

Hans-Joachim Lehmann, as the dossier writer is called, did not deal in drugs or accept stolen goods. Maybe Lehmann should have dealt drugs, then he would probably have been spared a police visit. Berlin maintains Europe's largest open-air drug transshipment centre in Görlitzer Park without the police intervening, as the city government wants.

Dit is Berlin, you might say. No staff for the routine work, but as soon as someone says something bad about a member of the state government, half a task force is in the door. This is Berlin under Red-Red-Green, I'd say. A certain Wurschtigkeit paired with the pride of the metropolis was always to the city characteristic. The mixture of incompetence, hubris and arrogance displayed by the Senate under Michael Müller is, however, unique.

Columnist Harald Martenstein now effortlessly fills his column in the ""Tagesspiegel"" with everyday administrative events. Some things are so strange that you only believe it because it's in the papers. In order to remedy the chronic delays at the S-Bahn, the transport companies came up with the idea of no longer stopping at every stop. The plan was only abandoned after protests. The district authorities are not able to issue birth certificates in a timely manner, reports the chronicler, dead people are not allowed under the ground because offices are overloaded. Marriage-willing people should put their plans far into the future.

An acquaintance has just moved to Charlottenburg with her husband and children. When she wanted to register at the residents' registration office, it was said that the earliest date was in four weeks. I thought it was illegal to wait so long to re-register because the registration laws give you a maximum of 14 days to indicate your new place of residence. In any case, it is a hindrance because, for example, you need a confirmation of enrolment for the children at a secondary school.

It reads funny when you don't live in Berlin. If you have the misfortune to be ruled by Michael Müller and his people, then it is best to flee into gallows humour. Or switch to private solutions. Those who are not dependent on public transport, functioning day-care centres and general schools do not have to worry about the state of politics. The rich always get along. If necessary, they employ not only nannies and private teachers but also staff to take care of the administrative procedures for them. You have to be able to afford to be left, that has always been the case.

*Rally movement reads well, but does not work*

I consider the Venezuelaisation of the German capital to be a politically underestimated topic. There are many who recommend Red-Red-Green as a model for the whole of Germany. The couple Lafontaine/Wagenknecht have just proclaimed a new rally movement under the headline ""Get up! Allegedly more than 60,000 people have already registered as supporters within one week.

Wagenknecht must be credited for realizing, unlike many on the left, that the German welfare state cannot exist under conditions of open borders. She and her husband decided to develop the welfare state, which gives her programme a decidedly national touch. The problem of their movement already plagued socialism: the transfer of the idea from the program into practice gets neither the idea, nor the reality. If you want to know what life would be like under a union of left-wing party, SPD and Greens, you only have to look around in the capital.

On the other hand, Wagenknecht's idea somehow fits in with Berlin. ""Getting up"" is the first political movement where you don't even have to leave the sofa to be there. It is enough to leave your name on the Internet to become ""part of the movement"". This even works in an environment in which the majority only leave the apartment during one of the occasional visits to late shopping.

63,"&gt;And voluntarily subjugating yourself to a culturally foreign power on a different continent is completely unreasonable to me - though I don't go around acting shocked every time I see a Polish / Romanian / Lithuanian person holding the standard views of these countries.

Russia is just as much of a cultural foreign power, one that we didn't like. If these countries dislike it the most it's probably because it's where they fucked up the most. They did in Ukraine too, but the Stockholm sydrome was strong there until 2014 it seems. 

&gt;Overall - it is far better documented than, for example, Russian presence in Donetsk/Lugansk, though I'm sure you don't doubt that, do you?

No one doubts that at this point. 

&gt;Only if you're directly bordering a stronger enemy country or an ally of one, and that enemy has a serious reason to attack you. Basically, AFAIK, the only country that could possibly have a territorial claim on you is Hungary. You have claims on Moldavia, but I really wouldn't expect Americans to go out of their way to help you with them - they don't do that. If anything, only Russia could actually accomplish that goal for you now (using their influence on Kishinev). So... You gain absolutely nothing out of this alliance, and only lose respect from the civilised world for being a black hole into which Americans can disappear people into. These are facts, not conjectures - I don't know what could possibly be argued here.

And are we not basically around Russia, a country that's been our enemy for the past 60 years or so? Hungary is a small country, no need to find alliances for them. Russia is a powerhouse and it was only natural that after communism fell, we'd want to make sure we don't ever come back t o Russia's grip, so the natural choice would be to join the other superpower, which is the US. Losing respect of the civilised world? Do you really think Belarus is more respected for example by being on Russia's side? More respected in Moscow probably, I agree. 

&gt;And you really don't see any connection between your American alliance, American anti-Russian activities on your territory (missile defence comes to mind) - and Russian response? That's not how the world works. Did you notice that Russia never threatens Finland with anything? Care to guess why?

Since when are we not allowed to instal defensive equipment on OUR OWN territory? It's not for offensive purposes, it's defensive ones. Russia has been threatening us before that happened anyways, so yeah. 

&gt; But that doesn't mean that I want to break the cultural and historical ties that have led to our natural alliance.

No such thing for us, so why would we bother with all that crap? The only thing we have in common with Russia is the religion, that's it. 

&gt;Which is fine, but there's a lot of different examples in ""the West"". Be France, if you can't be Switzerland or Sweden. Don't be a glorified colony.

Sweden has centuries since it's been attacked by Russia the last time. Finland and Austria signed a treaty after WW2 to remain neutral. We couldn't have that, we were pushed into the Russian sphere of influence and it's only normal to make sure we never get back there. France doesn't have the capabalities to defend European countries against Russia and even EU military support is not very reliable since the biggest member, Germany, relies on Russia for gas. Americans don't rely on them, so they are a better ally. Glorified colony? It's funny coming from someone from Belarus. You're criticising Romania for doing exactly what Belarus does, but on a smaller scale I might add.

81,"&gt; It would be wildly impractical to have Germany write out Eurobonds that a speculator could all try to redeem with the Maltese government, for example.

But exactly that are Eurobonds, bonds that ALL Euro countries guarantee for. So if any single country is bankrupt, all others have to pay.

Even more, if a single Euro countries ""decides"" for whatever reason to not honor their share of the burden, all others have to bridge the gap left by that country unless they want to be considered ""defaulting"" on their debt.

&gt;only 60% of GDP would be managed as debt, and no new EU credit will be given as long as debt is above that level.

Then you are helping nobody, nearly all countries that we might be worried about have a debt of way over 60%. But even with 60% the event can happen where all but Germany default on their share and suddenly Germany would be responsible for it unless it wants to default itself. Can it serve the 60% of the Eurozone GDP? No.

273,"Ok, so there are a few things I feel I need to say here.

First, you assume that guy guilty. While I'm also inclined to believe the yezidi girl here, there has never been provided actual proof of the dude being a member or former member of ISIS. As germany is a state where you can't be convicted without proof, what in your opinion is the police supposed to do here?

Secondly, if you payed attention, you might have noticed that the girl was a refugee, just like the man who is presumed to be an ISIS member, and also her mother, brother and father.

Now tell me, how do you differentiate between, say, her brother and the IS dude? Of course under the assumption that an IS member wouldn't just tell you the truth.

And last, but not least, ""doesnt deserve human rights"" is the same mentality that makes, apart from their other atrocities, ISIS the scum they are. They are scum, and their acts are reprehensible, but they still are human, and thus deserve human rights.

That human right may be the right for a fair trial, where they then get convicted and punished appropriately for their crimes, but they still have that right. This is assuming a civil environment; in an active war, they are of course an enemy combatant and the geneva protocol (or whatever the appropriate treaty for international warfare is) applies.

Point is, if we label ISIS as subhuman, we are no better than they (in that aspect, ISIS has other crimes to answer for).

Also, Merkel did the right thing (in accepting a large amount of refugees). Yes, there may be some amount of radicals mixed in, but there was also a huge group that legitimately fled for their lives, and as a nation that has actively contributed to the age of enlightenment, it would be a betrayal of their humanist traditions to deny people fleeing a civil war a safe asylum.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/97s5j3/kurdish_yezidi_girl_who_escaped_is_flees_germany/e4bu8zu/,Krumel0,1534469422

277,"Oh, Berlin. What is Berlin? Berlin, as a city, brings nothing but shame to Germany on the international stage. When comparing Berlin with other European capitals such as London, Paris, Madrid and Amsterdam, any decent human’s face must blush in humiliation. Even small countries like Austria, Belgium or Switzerland have Vienna, Brussels and Zurich: presentable cities, complete with high standards of living. Germany gets punished with Berlin, capital of losers. In all the republic, Berlin is home to the largest number of arseholes by far. Deutsche Bahn, Bundestag, Air Berlin and Axel Springer are but a few examples of all the incompetent scum being kept here. Glorious times have long since passed, the city is face down in the dirt. Berliners are lazy sods to their very core. Traits that would, in any civilised culture, pass for nothing but laziness, rudeness, incompetence, dissocial personality disorder or idiocy, are taken by the Berliner and declared a way of life. That is why the Berliner harbours intense feelings of hatred for anyone who’s better than him in any way. Especially the all-around superior Southern Germany are a thorn in his side. He envies their success, and Munich makes the top on his list of hatred. That city is – and has! – everything that Berlin wants to be and have. Berliners take no interest in the fact that it is Munich that finances their dissolute lifestyle, in fact, they secretly believe that they have earned it. So instead of freeing themselves from their envious and resentful lethargy, instead of rolling up their sleeves and improve their city, they revel in their antisocial freeloading and praise their so-called global city. Culturally, Berliners are set up rather weakly, great works lie far back in history. Moreover, mispronouncing “g” as “j” is considered a great cultural feat. Advanced students have mastered ending each and every sentence with a “wa?”. The city’s culinary performance is second-rate. Here, a sausage made from glued-together, meaty odds and ends adorned with ketchup and curry powder is sold as a culinary masterpiece. Hardly any reasonable person would consider a bratwurst with ketchup a recipe, let alone the holy grail of culinary arts. Yet, in their magnanimity, the rest of the republic lets the Berliner keep his delusion, not wanting to amplify his inferiority complex. Economically, Berlin is an utter disaster, even the late GDR stood on more solid ground. The local economy is based around alternative blogs, something-something-media and, if universities are to be believed, gender studies. Disregarding his own bankruptcy, the Berliner treats himself to prestigious projects like the city palace and the airport – which, considering its inoperative nature, is likely an art installation. Moreover, the city houses all popular parties’ headquarters, who refrain from using “traitors” in their official names (Probably for marketing reasons). For the longest time, this “town’s” “mayor”, the jolly Wowibear, butchered anything he found left in a presentable state. Long story short: Berlin is Germany’s tiled coffee table. It is to Germany what Greece is to the European Union, and if it had open sewerage, it would be Germanys Romania. Berlin is a blemish, the abscess on the arse of the nation. Berlin is the uninvited party guest, who didn’t even bring any booze and wouldn’t even understand he’s not welcome if he had is teeth beaten out and got thrown down the stairs. Berlin is the Detroit of Germany and should be sold to Poland for 200 Złoty.",North Rhine-Westphalia (Germany),/r/europe/comments/97kr0b/european_capitals_by_city_emblems/e4bue9a/,cauliflowerthrowaway,1534469565

Do they? Or do they claim to in order to evade harassment and blacklisting from self-righteous busybodies like you?

&gt;That human rights are more than just words and require action.

Yawn. ""Human rights"" is a concept that only the West is naive enough to subscribe to, and rest of the world exploits us for it. They send us their unwanted, knowing that our governments are corrupt and stupid enough to take them in and shower them with gifts. They look at us and see pathetic, sheltered idiots who will hand them a free lunch. There shouldn't be any ""human rights,"" it just leads to us being exploited. We should have CITIZEN rights instead.

&gt;Of course there is. But virtually all Germans view people as more than just their economic worth

Is that why Germany is strangling Greece to death with austerity? Is that why German companies are ripping off Eastern Europe by sending them products that are inferior to their Western equivalents? Is that why Germany buys so much fuel from Russia, despite Russia being an oppressive autocracy? I guess you aren't so pure and noble after all.

&gt;If you were to move to Germany today and entered debates, you'd be a social outcast. 

Yeah, because the government throws people in jail for daring to question their policies regarding migrants, calling it ""hate speech."" And the media backs them up by demonizing dissenters.

&gt;And, I would add, rightfully so.

I suppose that's a thing - I know France has toll-roads and though they're highly uncommon in the Netherlands I do know of one toll-tunnel not too far from here. (Only found out about it earlier this year. Had no idea we had even that one.) It's a scary thought though that some tunnel-owning holding company might just have their tollbooth operators popping in to stick some used chewinggum on the leaking cracks and that no one from the ministry for infrastructure might ever do a safety inspection. Unimaginable to me, really. (But then, I didn't imagine we had toll-roads at all.)

Maintenance may have been the company's responsibility to organize and pay for, but I should think the ultimate responsibility for _deciding whether roads are safe enough to drive on_ lies with the local government or the ministry in charge of that. You don't take the butcher's word for it. That's how you get mislabeled horse-meat. 

Ultimately, legally, the owners are probably the ones on the hook for this disaster, but really, assigning blame shouldn't be _the first_ priority here. The first priority should be to do a really comprehensive and swift inspection of the rest of the roadnetwork to see where the next failures are likeliest to be and get to work patching them up or cutting them off.

Stop pretending to be idiot, you cannot be that bad.

Scars of partitions were fresh and no one could agree to give Poland again to soviets. In my opinion preventional attacks are the best tactic which saved us in 1920 and unfortunately we haven't started war against germany in 1933 when it would take only few weeks or months to wipe out nazis from history and start thinking how to deal with communism. The whole point of it is that Poland was representing freedom values, II Polish Republic was very liberal and free state for its citizens and we had to face 2 tyranies like communists and facists that enslaved society and spread terror around Europe.

758,"&gt;  Seems like for you and many Russians the very existence of Poland is ""expansionism"".

Invading other countries for their territory is expansionism. I mean, it was Polish leader himself that said its right time to expand. 

&gt;I meant the Polish-Bolshevik war. Destroying Poland in the ""counter -attack"" would be somewhat understandable. Soviets wanted to march further west, so ""Soviet plans went beyond that"".

They havent even finished their civil war, were in complete disarray and had shortage of manpower. Where exactly would they march to? 

&gt;Still doesn't justify the invasion.

Thats a tricky one. From history we know that Soviets expected war with Germany and were preparing for it. Key to winning the war was buffer between them that would buy time. This was the case with Finland as well. Soviets tried in vain to get other powers on their side against Germany with Polish ambasador going as far as saying Poland would assist Germany in invading Soviet union. In perfect world the Soviets should have stayed out (i doubt you'd like German total occupation though), understanding warfare and geopolitics means Soviets had to invade. And tbf they waited until Poland lost all their representatives so there was noone to speak for Poland.

&gt; After what NKVD did to Poles there?

What exactly did NKVD do to Poland before Soviet invasion?

&gt;As I said above - independent Poland and independent Russia will always be conflicted because they want to have influence over the very same space. It's just how it is.

834,"&gt; It never was meant as an argument against humans being sexually dimorphic. It's an explanation of why traditional gender roles don't fit everyone. 

Oh I see. No need to explain this to me.
&gt; You can boil it down to ""well, they're outliers"" all you want, but it doesn't change that a significant number of people don't fit traditional roles.

Not even I fit traditional gender roles perfectly, again this is something that seems obvious to me. Significant number of people don't fit traditional roles perfectly and tiny amount of people don't fit them at all. This is not something you need a gender studies degree to figure out. But now that we figured it out what are we going to do with this information?
&gt; Sexual dimorphism exists in differing degrees, and it isn't perfect in humans.

Are you sure about that? What are the degrees of dimorphism and what would perfect dimorphism look like? Can we find it somewhere in nature? From what I understand dimorphism isn't supposed to manifest in 100% difference and effectively divide species into two different species. It's more like a large scale specialization.
&gt; How you identify effects how you behave, and as a result, how others communicate with you.

To some degree. I was thinking more about stuff that has nothing to do with how you identify, like openness vs zealousness. 
&gt; To establish the distinction between gender and sex. That identity doesn't always line up with physicality.

No I mean what's the point of saying ""identity doesn't always line up with physicality""? I think it's something observable in disorders like gender dysphoria or bodily integrity dysphoria.

(Turkey is technically not a dictatorship, the guy keeps getting elected by large margins. Cheating is much less rampant than the Europeans think it is. There is however a massive monopoly on media which makes sure the elections are not held on equal ground)

I pointed out that authoritarian regimes are not exclusive to Muslims and that being one doesn't make Turkey closer to Saudi Arabia than Europe in culture. Then I gave examples from cultures much further from that of the Saudi's, including one from Europe. I just added that religion makes it easier to fall into autocratic tendencies. You then claimed that was exactly your point, which is in no way accurate.

You straw manned the fuck out of the topic and now doing it again. The average Turk is not closer to Saudi Arabians than Europeans in culture. Average Turk is more religious than the average European, yes. But a culture isn't only comprised of religion.

918,"&gt;The countries of northern Europe were well-placed to take advantage of membership in the new
union. They could continue to pursue export-led growth strategies in a more favorable context in
which their principal trading partners could no longer devalue to increase the competitiveness of
their own products against those exports; and the Euro held down the external exchange rate,
thereby enhancing the attractiveness of their exports in other markets. Based on serious efforts 
8
to contain wage rates, countries in northern Europe such as Germany began to build up large
balance of payments surpluses inside the Eurozone.
For the political economies of southern Europe, however, EMU posed more serious
challenges. Entry lowered some of their transaction costs and the convergence criteria in the
run-up to monetary union initially strengthened the hand of governments seeking wage restraint.
But entry into monetary union also called into question the viability of the demand-led growth
strategies on which these countries had long relied, because they could no longer devalue to
offset the accompanying inflation. Their governments had to decide whether to abandon
demand-led strategies and, if so, in favor of what. As it happened, the decision was largely made
for them by the unanticipated effects of EMU itself. The confidence effects generated by the
new union quickly lowered the cost of capital in southern Europe; and, to invest the balance of
payments surpluses building up in the north, the banks of northern Europe sent large flows of
funds to southern Europe. Thus, even when the governments of the south did not adopt an
expansionary fiscal stance, cheap credit fueled the expansion of domestic demand.
The effects were predictable, if largely unpredicted. With expansion came inflation,
which took prices and relative unit labor costs in the south to new heights. Unable to devalue to
offset the effect of such developments, those countries saw their current account balances
deteriorate, as their products became less competitive on world markets, just as competition from
the emerging economies of Asia and Eastern Europe intensified. In principle, the ECB could
have used its monetary instruments to reduce rates of inflation in southern Europe, but doing so
would have risked contraction in the north, where real interest rates were already higher.
Instead, the ECB kept its eye on German wage settlements, which set the pattern for agreements
in many other parts of northern Europe.

No economist has ever thought that a European wide currency union without a fiscal union would work, and wow it isn't. Those countries you listed are small ex-communist states that are for the most part still playing catch up with the west so I don't know why you bothered to include them.",Italy,/r/europe/comments/97j3qw/merkel_says_turkeys_turmoil_shows_value_of_shared/e4aapsr/,Sculacciami,1534417192

990,"&gt; And how is it actually stated here? In the Netherlands, all bridges are safe, said Bob Demoet, chief engineer director at Rijkswaterstaat, yesterday morning in radio program 1 to 1. ""Once every six years we do an extensive inspection and last year we had another seventy bridges in the picture. to prevent overdue maintenance. ""

Welp, I guess it wasn't a wake-up call after all. The Italian bridge was actively maintained, and despite some major concerns about long-time stability, there was no indication of an imminent collapse. Guess what? The Netherlands has literally hundreds of bridges in exactly this state!

- [Bridges in Rotterdam are poorly maintained](https://www.ad.nl/rotterdam/slechte-staat-bruggen-speelt-verkeer-parten~a628897f/)
- [Bridges in Hardenberg are in extremely poor condition](https://www.destentor.nl/hardenberg/afgesloten-bruggen-bij-gramsbergen-in-slechte-staat~a621d1da/)

- [10% of the bridges in South-Holland are poorly maintained](https://www.cda.nl/zuid-holland/actueel/nieuws/steekproef-over-staat-van-onderhoud-zuid-hollandse-bruggen/)

Yes, they still meet legal requirements. No, there is no indication that any of them is about to collapse. Yes, they are actively monitored. But Genoa was doing the same, it seems. So what did Bob Demoet learn? Not a goddamn thing, it seems. If it were a wake-up call, I would've at least expected an exhaustive enquiry in the conditions of all major bridges and a significant increase in the replacement efforts, but I guess all is well if we can delay it for a few more years in order to lighten the Cabinet's budget.",The Netherlands,/r/europe/comments/97q50a/bridge_disaster_wakeup_call_for_other_european/e4abfle/,KittensInc,1534418409

1129,"I mean that's not even the point; the English word for it is just ""God"" regardless.

Like the Sikh god is _clearly_ a different entity and the English word for it is still ""God"" because the English word ""god"" predates Abrahamic monotheism as does the French word ""Dieu"" or the Finnish word ""Jumala"" or the Latin word ""Deus"" or the Arabic word ""Allah"" or the Turkish word ""Tanrı"" or the Persian word ""Khuda"".

People have some really weird idea that ""God"" or ""Allah"" are like proper names of specific deities or something. Surprise surprise that the Arabic version of the bible also just says ""Allah"" because it's the Arabic word for ""God"" just like the French one says ""Dieu"" and Persian one again says ""Khuda"".

Whether these gods are  the ""same"" god or whether the god described in the old and new testament or in different books of either are even the same is pretty much irrelevant as all of these words long predate any of these religions and whenever speakers of such a language convert to such a religion they typically just use the word for ""a god"" in their language and capitalize it and call it good and use it to refer to a single monotheistic god. ""Allah"" in Arabic is just a contraction of ""al-ilah"" as in ""the [one] god""

Edit: There also seems to be some strange misconception that all Muslims speak Arabic and thus use ""Allah"" whilst as said it's ""Tanrı"" in Turkish and ""Khuda"" in Persian for instance just as Christianity knows many languages.",The League of Glorious Longhairs,/r/europe/comments/97ko90/turks_ask_god_to_depress_value_of_us_dollar/e4a3q5x/,swaffel_me_zachtjes,1534402945

I live in Malmö, THE city of immigration. It's rough by Swedish standard but the Swedish standard is a rural village in the woods where the most exotic thing is the guy that makes pizzas. Inbred villagers will read the Alt-right blogs and thinks that a nazis view of Sweden is reality.

Swedens immigration policy have been due for a stern review since the Bosnian war, yes and absolutely but I feel extremely saddened that well educated and wealthy Swedes that never seen a Muslim other than on the TV, turns to a political party that's more conservative than the actual Christian party.

The Swedish Democrats have lots active members that join during the  time the party were officially a nazi party. They've never had an agenda other than ""fuck niggers and fuck you"", untill recently where they took the stance as homophobic, climate change denying, ""pro""-life/anti-abortion, offical state religion, anti-EU, pro-armed police force in order to ""quell the ghettos"" and anti-socialdemocratic values as in anti-social security(the most unswedish thing there is).

This on top of having absolutely almost 0 parliament attendence, Russian connections in both social and financial ways, has several members kick out of the party for being nazis in public, had lots of members leaving the party for a more nazi approach party called ""Alternative for Sweden"", high ranking members have been brawling with iron pipes against ""brown people"" and in recent news, the party leader and front figure won't be attending in any government position.

No that would be Ali Pasha. Napoleon admired him but Ali hated him.

1195,"# Translation

The discussion about who is ultimately responsible for the collapse of the bridge in Genoa is in full swing. The drama with at least 39 deaths has also prompted debate in other European countries about the safety of bridges and roads.

For example, France is in turmoil about a recently published report. Figures from the government show that 800 bridges are in bad shape and that there is a risk of collapse in the long term.

""Strikingly, the report has been there for a few weeks and it was not picked up by anyone,"" says correspondent Frank Renout. ""But after the disaster in Genoa, everything else is natural, and all media pick up the figures from the report.""

**Closed preventively**

Almost 4000 bridges in France have minor defects, according to the government report. There, small repairs are sufficient to ensure safety. Renout: ""The Ministry of Transport says there is a chance that the 800 bridges that are in poor condition will be preventively closed.""

The government wants to spend 25 percent more money on maintenance of roads and bridges from next year. This year the budget was around 800 million euros. ""And all specialists say: that is far too little.""
Accelerated renovation

The disaster in Italy has also been a wake-up call in Bulgaria. 211 rickety bridges are being renovated at an accelerated pace in response to Genoa. These include 34 highway bridges, half of which are in poor condition. And worn out bridges from the communist era.

The situation in Spain is somewhat more complicated, the newspaper El Confidencial recently experienced. Journalists caught up after a freedom of information request. What turned out: the state of the Spanish bridges and viaducts is state secret.

The government says that one third of all bridges (almost 11,000 in total) are checked annually in the country. Where necessary, action is taken according to the relevant ministry. The inspection would be done according to methods that also apply elsewhere in Europe. Incidentally, most buildings on highways in Spain are relatively new.

**'Fist-sized concrete pieces'**

According to the government there is also no direct risk of collapse in Belgium, but there are concerns. For example, a viaduct over the E17 motorway in a suburb of Ghent. That is, just like the Morandi bridge in Genoa, built in the 1960s, with similar materials.

""The viaduct in Gentbrugge still shows defects where urgent a solution is needed,"" says the residents' group zvw ViaduKaduk against the VRT. ""Fist-sized concrete pieces"" would fall down regularly.

And how is it actually stated here? In the Netherlands, all bridges are safe, said Bob Demoet, chief engineer director at Rijkswaterstaat, yesterday morning in radio program 1 to 1. ""Once every six years we do an extensive inspection and last year we had another seventy bridges in the picture. to prevent overdue maintenance.

Yes.  But somehow, a decision had to be made.  If it were yea, then those in favor of nay would be unhappy.  If it were nay, those in favor of yea would be unhappy.

You could do it via referendum or via dictatorial fiat, by monarchial order, by committee decision, vote of legislators, or even flipping a coin.  But it would still wind up with those who opposed the outcome unhappy about the result, regardless of which faction it was.  Leave, and  British cities like London, Liverpool, and Edinburgh would be unhappy.  Remain, and the towns and villages in the countryside would be unhappy.  And the result is significant enough that it'd be a bitter pill to swallow for whichever side lost.

As for complaining about ""the south of England"", you do them a disservice.  It was largely the south that [most wanted Remain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Results_of_the_United_Kingdom_European_Union_membership_referendum,_2016#/media/File%3AUnited_Kingdom_EU_referendum_2016_area_results.svg).

Finally, the British government's Brexit impact analysis — which is the only one I'm aware of with a geographical breakdown as to impact — did not show Scotland as being the most-impacted.

---

The US Federal Reserve Bank holds 4,800,000,000,000 in US$ debt (I.E. national and foreign companies and governments have borrowed $4.8 Trillion from the US Fed, mostly long term bonds.) This debt is denominated in dollars, so when the debt is repaid, it is repaid to the US Fed in dollars.

When this happens the debtor must acquire these dollars from somewhere. That reduces the global supply of dollars, thus raising the relative value against other currencies. Those countries which are highly reliant on foreign capital, such as Brazil and Turkey, are hit especially hard, and their currency is significantly devalued against the dollar.

Recently the Qatari government provided a significant investment to Turkey, in dollars, to prop up the Turkish lira, and provide some liquidity so their economy can keep going. This was, however, a one-off transaction in the amount of $15,000,000,000.

The U.S. federal reserve, however, is redeeming $600,000,000,000 in US$ debt, which will devalue the lira a lot over a period of a year. Ultimately Qatar solved the immediate cash crunch facing Turkey (2.5% of the total planned US Fed debt redemption,) but the US Fed is able to put a lot more pressure on Turkey via this process than pretty much anyone but China can handle, and China is reserving (I.E. holding back currency reserves) heavily due to the U.S. trade tariffs having a deeper effect on them, than Chinese tariffs on the US are having on the US.

Direct investment in foreign denominated capital is more efficient immediately (in strengthening the Turkish Lira) than squeezing dollar supply by calling the debt (can weaken the Turkish Lira,) however, the foreign capital will drain out of the Turkey given it is a mass importer (it imports much more than it exports, and its trade partners want payment in EU or USD.) The investment is less effective over time.",,/r/europe/comments/97kqje/jewish_zionist_bankers_caused_turkish_lira/e4a0dud/,joey_bosas_ankles,1534397331

Referenced. Don't ignore please and thank you.

If you think it is controversial, please present information. But sure I can run with the idea of controversial, however that it is the most sensitive part of the penis is not. So what do we do when something is controversial? Do we proceed to perform medically unnecessary surgery on someone else's genitals without their consent? Or do we allow people to evaluate the information themselves and make their own decision? Pretty obvious we let people make their own decisions.

Cool, a lot of bantering. So comparisons between individuals is difficult and subjective. This furthers the difficulty in knowing the harm and furthers the argument that we should not start cutting off body parts without medical necessity. Leaving it the patient to make his own decision. And all that bantering comes to a final solution of not cutting someones 'primary' source. In that case, the foreskin is [the most sensitive part of the penis.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/Sorrells.gif) Thank you for making that one easy. We still haven't covered exactly where you draw the line. Again, since that's where we're throwing people in jail it needs exacting, precise, and unambiguous definitions. That's despite the obvious flaw that you still seem ok with impacting someone else's sexual life for no medical reason, which is an ethical conversation all on its own.

&gt; invariably leads to a major impairment of female sexuality

Oh are you sure? I ask again, are you sure? What about that genital scraping. And genital nicking? Plenty of advocates say it doesn't impair sexual function. And we've come all the way around too, the WHO forbids *all* procedures, including nicking and scrapping which previously you were ok with by implying they were not serious. By all accounts they *seem* to be minor, but the WHO doesn't care and puts it all as mutilation, to err on the side of not impacting people. The WHO is in disagreement with you.

The topic under discussion was why this excellent definition should or can't be applied to both genders. You've not presented anything. Discussion leads to laws, not the other way around. We don't allow laws to dictate morality.

Lol and the final attempt to duck out of the debate by calling it emotional. Looking above I've provided plenty of medical and scientific references, not as many as I usually do, but a still a good amount. Lots of questions too, which went unanswered btw, but that was to highlight how fuzzy the line was and, sorry to say, your inability to draw it.

But here it is as per Europe Reddit Rules: 
____________________________________________________________________________
TURKEY’S ECONOMY is in crisis, teetering on the brink of an implosion that could undo two decades of progress. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is blaming economic warfare by President Trump, who last week announced a doubling of tariffs on imports of Turkish aluminum and steel . The U.S. action was ill-advised, in part because it may confuse Turks about who is really responsible for the collapse of the national currency: none other than Mr. Erdogan himself.

Since winning election to a newly empowered presidency in June, Mr. Erdogan has accelerated a shift toward one-man rule that has unnerved the foreign investors and lenders upon whom Turkey heavily depends. He installed his son-in-law as finance minister and has used his sway over the central bank to prevent a desperately needed rise in interest rates. The predictable result has been a precipitous drop in the value of the Turkish lira against the dollar, which in turn threatens to bankrupt the many companies and banks that have taken foreign loans.

The economic mismanagement is a piece of Mr. Erdogan’s increasingly megalomaniacal rule, which has included massive domestic repression and deluded attempts to bully other states, including Israel, Germany and Russia. The Turkish ruler eventually backed down from those battles, only to take on his country’s closest military ally: the United States.


In an apparent attempt to force a U.S. handover of an ally-turned-rival who lives in Pennsylvania, Mr. Erdogan imprisoned a number of American citizens on trumped-up charges, including a pastor, Andrew Brunson, whom Mr. Erdogan has openly described as a bargaining chip. Mr. Trump thought he made a deal with the Turkish strongman in a July meeting to free Mr. Brunson; when the Turks failed to deliver, an angry White House imposed sanctions on two Turkish government ministers before announcing the new tariffs.

One problem with the administration’s response is that it is too narrowly focused on Mr. Brunson, who has become a cause celebre for Christian evangelicals. Mr. Trump ought to be demanding that all 20 U.S. citizens being held be released, along with several Turkish employees of U.S. consulates. In addition, the use of tariffs as a political weapon is a dangerous breach of international norms. The administration would have done better to expand on the sanctions against individuals involved in the improper detentions and other human rights abuses, and to hold up, as Congress has mandated, delivery to Turkey of F-35 fighter jets.

The decision to get tough with Mr. Erdogan is nevertheless the right one. Analysts who worry about a fracturing of relations with a key NATO ally ought to recognize that Turkey has not been behaving as an ally; allies do not take U.S. citizens hostage. Fears that the currency crisis will spread to other developing nations so far look exaggerated. Mr. Erdogan’s own threats to turn to Russia look empty; Moscow cannot supply the billions of dollars needed to pull Turkey’s economy out of the hole he has dug.

Mr. Trump evidently believes that he has decisive leverage over Mr. Erdogan, and he is probably right. He should use it not just to free one Christian pastor but also to show an unhinged ruler the costs of playing dictator, either to his own people or to the rest of the world.",,/r/europe/comments/97orm5/trump_is_right_to_push_turkey_hes_just_doing_it/e49u6mv/,Shadow3ragon,1534389449

In the clusterfuck there were killings between serbs-serbs, croats-croats, croats-serbs, serbs-croats, and if you add muslims to the mix it gets even more complicated.  

Just to show your comparison is not that appropriate cause in some cases seniors, women and children were killed and they are not really a threat (from wiki).

&gt;9-10 August, 1941- Chetniks massacred Croats, mostly seniors, women, and children (including 49 children under the age of 12) in Krnjeuša. Croatian homes were burned and robbed. 240 killed civilians were identified, including a 34-year-old Catholic priest, Rev Krešimir Barišić, who was tortured and burned alive, as well as 49 children and 72 women (a number of whom were pregnant). That same day, Chetniks killed about 70 Croats in the neighboring village of Vrtoče. A number of people ran to Bihać. After the massacre, the Croat population almost entirely disappeared from the area

1428,"Sexual orientation are not about what you're doing, so it's not about ""how many experiences per year"", it's about what attracts you, what turns you on, what you want to do.  


Here's how the Kinsley scale works : If you have no interest in sex or relationship with people of your own sex (it was done a long time ago, you could probably replace it with gender, but it would create paradoxes and edges cases so I'm going to stick with ""sex"" for this one), than you're a 0. If you have no interest in sex or relationship with people who aren't of your own sex, then you're a 6. If you have interest in either sex and/or relationship with people who are of the same sex as you and with people who aren't of the same sex as you, then you're bi.  


The most common definition of bisexuality is ""the capacity to be attracted, romantically or sexually, not necessarily the same way, at the same time or with the same intensity, by people of your own gender and at least one more"", or the TL:DR, you're attracted to people who are like you and others.  


So your bi paradox isn't a paradox : if you're into people of your own gender and people of at least one other, you're bi, therefore, if a straight guy is sexually attracted to men, if he wants to give blowjobs to other men, he isn't straight, he's bi. Hence the Kinsley scale : 0, you're straight, 6, you're gay / lesbian, anything in between, you're bisexual. 50/50 : bi. 99% into others, 1% into the same gender : bi. The other way around : still bi. ""Not exclusively straight"", means bi.  


Of course, that's all if we're talking about sexual orientation, and not talking about sexual identity, what people identify as, what feels right to them, which just deletes of that with a big ""identify as whatever feels fine to you and don't let anyone tell you that you're wrong"".",Aquitaine (France),/r/europe/comments/97hfls/young_refugee_is_not_gay_enough_to_get_asylum_in/e49m3s3/,Thelk641,1534381412

You seem to have forgotten that Lenin was an orthodox Marxist and Marxism prescribed (I won't go into the details here) that the World Revolution (which, by the way, was the end game, remember?) would start by turning the German working class into a revolutionary subject, and once the the revolution has secured Germany, the rest of Europe is pretty much done and would fall in place immediately, since Germany was the most populous, most advanced and most heavily industrialised country in Europe which sits right in the middle of it all. 

This Marxist orthodoxy held true until well into the Stalin era (the ""socialism in one country"" doctrine, a  completely foreign concept to  original Marxism), and Lenin himself considered the Russian Revolution to be basically a ""holding operation"" to put everything in place for the hammer to fall in Germany.

Im sorry, Just because your own nation overstates your contribution.. It says nothing about Greece:

https://www.warhistoryonline.com/world-war-ii/nazi-invasion-greece-yugoslavia-m.html

&gt;Yugoslavia did have a compelling strategy if faced with an overwhelming German invasion: retreat from all fronts except the Southern, advancing on the Italian positions in Albania, meet up with the Greek army and build a substantial Southern front. But due to the rapid fall of the country and inadequate gains against the Italian Army, this move failed and Yugoslavia surrendered to Germany.


&gt; The British, however, were not able to commit nearly enough troops to the defense of Greece and the deployment of over 60,000 men was heavily criticized and seen as a largely symbolic gesture of support to fight a “gentleman’s war” of honor that was sure to be lost.


&gt;The Greeks had a formidable front line defense along their Northeastern border with Bulgaria called the Metaxas Line. Similar to the Maginot Line in France, it featured pillboxes and other fortifications. But the Greeks, who had the bulk of their army fighting the Italians in Albania to the West, were not nearly prepared to defend it well. They did so anyway, despite British requests to form a shorter, more concentrated line further into the Greek mainland. 

&gt; The Greeks, reluctant to concede to the Italian army they had been fairing so well against, wouldn’t pull back their front until it was too late and the Germans advancing from Yugoslavia flanked them and forced their surrender.

And let us not forget, it was the Greeks who defeated the Italian force.

Now to some of your points Pastafarianism may be serious in its critique of religion but it is not serious in actually beleiving in a past god. Furthermore, Protestantism is not a religion about protest, fudnermentaly it is chritianity that spawned out of a protest against the catholic church. Ergo it is not the protest that they worship, the protest is a disagreement of dogma - this dogma is what they ernestly beleive.

Cogency is the ""quality of being clear, logical, and convincing"": now while i dodnt think religion is much of those, in context it means that the religion it self sets out its beleifs etc. In chritianites case it will be the church that one belongs to that does so. The fact that they can be contradictory in themselves is irrelevent. Furthermore, your understadning of catholic dogma seems flawed, I dont know if its setteled yet but most catholics take the eating body and drinking blood as symobilstic of the sacrafice - not an actual eating of flesh etc.

By Steven Erlanger
Aug. 15, 2018

BRUSSELS — From the start of the torturous negotiations over Brexit, as Britain’s exit from the European Union is known, the talks have followed an all too familiar dynamic.

The Europeans set the agenda; the British push for concessions or special deals, while trying to work out among themselves what they really want. The Europeans say no, sticking to a pretty hard line.

But now, with 85 percent of a deal completed, and the toughest issues remaining, European officials say they are increasingly worried that Prime Minister Theresa May’s government is so divided and fragile that it could collapse, scuttling a deal and inflicting damage on the Continental economy.

So the Europeans are now exploring ways to finesse their position, three senior European officials say, to sign a withdrawal agreement by the end of the year so it can be ratified by the end of March, when Brexit occurs regardless.

That would formally divorce Britain from the bloc after more than 40 years of marriage. But some of the hardest issues would be left for transition talks that will last another 19 months, until the end of 2020.

All of the officials spoke anonymously, following diplomatic practice, and because they do not have permission to be quoted by name.

Big issues remain to be resolved, with the Irish border chief among them. So the Europeans say they may agree to fuzzy language in the withdrawal agreement’s political declaration — along the lines of “aiming to negotiate the closest possible partnership.”

The aim is to reduce internal British political warfare over how to best keep the promise of no hard border between Ireland, which will remain in the European Union, and Northern Ireland, which will not.

The new British Foreign Secretary, Jeremy Hunt, has been traveling through northern Europe, lobbying for Britain’s position, warning of a chaotic no deal Brexit, and urging “a change in approach” by Brussels. The British and European Union negotiators will meet again on Thursday and Friday, an unusual mid-vacation session.

A big sticking point is how to oversee disputes between Britain and the bloc, since Mrs. May, pushed by fervent Brexiteers, does not want to give the European Court of Justice, the bloc’s highest court, any authority over Britain once it leaves the European Union.

But the thorniest issue is the nature of the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, because its status hinges on some understanding of the future trading relationship between Britain and the bloc, which remains up in the air.

Mrs. May, at her meeting with her cabinet at Chequers in July, supported the concept of a “free trade area for goods” — but not services — made possible by what she called a “facilitated customs arrangement.”

European officials said that the Chequers statement at least clarified for the first time what Britain wants, even if they rejected her customs proposal out of hand.

What was objectionable, they say, is that Britain talks of wanting an “economic partnership” with the bloc that is akin to being part of the single market for goods alone.

The Europeans have been clear that Britain cannot keep what it had as a member without the obligations of membership, in particular the free movement of goods, as well as capital, services and labor.

Nor can it be in a formal customs union if it wishes to make its own trading deals, as Mrs. May continues to insist.

Britain has failed to understand, the Europeans say, how much the European Union itself feels threatened by the world since the Brexit referendum — by the challenges of President Trump, Russia and China, as well as the rise of authoritarian leaders in Hungary and Poland and populists in general who are largely anti-Brussels, as are those in Italy.

So there is even less willingness now to compromise on key European Union principles, and a desire, especially from France, to make it clear that membership in the bloc has privileges not shared by other countries.

There is also a growing weariness with Britain and Mrs. May, who seems to be arguing that she is politically so weak that she cannot talk honestly with her own citizens about what Brexit actually means.

“The U.K. is looking at this from the angle of the future relationship,” a senior European official said. “The other 27 are looking at this as an attack on what the E.U. is.”

“We regret the loss of the U.K., which is a cost for everyone,” the official added. “But it would be even worse if this is the occasion for compromising on the core of the E.U. — that’s to say, the single market.”

That understanding finally seems to be coming home to the British, the Europeans feel, but they are reluctant to specify the consequences, for fear of hurting Mrs. May and creating a new political crisis in Britain that would throw the whole Brexit process into chaos.

So the Europeans are discussing vague language about a future relationship, hoping that will be enough to make Britain accept the need for a backstop to ensure there is no hard or visible border on the island of Ireland.

“The aim,” a second European official said, “is to make what seems unacceptable merely unpalatable.”

European officials are also searching for compromise.

If a formal customs union is impossible, European officials say one solution might be a future free-trade agreement with the European Union, much as Canada and Japan now have, but one that could allow the unencumbered movement of goods across the British (and Irish) borders.

But there is no guarantee that such a free-trade deal will be quick or easy. Normally such agreements take years to negotiate.

There is also discussion of limiting the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice and European Union customs officials over Northern Ireland as part of the “backstop” deal, which Ireland (with the support of Brussels) has insisted be written into the withdrawal agreement.

If Britain and Brussels cannot work out their future trading relationship in time, the backstop would essentially establish a border between the entire island of Ireland and the rest of Britain for customs, regulatory standards and value-added tax.

Given the difficulties, some in Britain have been forecasting no deal at all, a so-called cliff-edge Brexit. But senior European officials think that a deal is still more likely than not, if both sides are “reasonable.”

They also say they would be willing to extend the “transition” period to negotiate a new relationship with Britain past December 2020, its current end date. But a specific clause to that effect, with a time limit, must be included in the withdrawal agreement.

The problem for Britain is that any extension would mean additional payments into the European Union budget and a continuation of “rule taking” without a vote, which would outrage Brexiteers.

What many European officials fear is less a cliff-edge Brexit next March than one at the end of 2020, if a final free-trade deal is not completed.

To negotiate a special free-trade deal with Britain that avoids a hard border in Ireland, plus a possible second agreement on security, would ordinarily take years.

But the Brexit withdrawal agreement comes first, and the remaining issues are difficult.

There's not many cases of countries that got dismantled the way we were. For you our struggle is expansionism, for us it was getting our country back in it's rightful borders. All things considered, we haven't tried to reinstate the country in it's pre 1st partition state cause we thought it would be unreasonable and unsustainable. Seems like for you and many Russians the very existence of Poland is ""expansionism"".

 The reality is that both Poland and Russia fought for the very same space that wasn't really lying at the core of their existence for centuries. Both had more or less reasonable claim to those lands. Both didn't took indigenous population there seriously enough. Both want to have influence there to this day. 

&gt; You wrote ""That still fits the definition of ""repelling your enemy"". Soviet plans went beyond that."". I understand it as unreasonable demand from the Soviets to stop the counterattack at the border. If you initiate a war then you have no justification to complain when they come to your home.

I meant the Polish-Bolshevik war. Destroying Poland in the ""counter -attack"" would be somewhat understandable. Soviets wanted to march further west, so ""Soviet plans went beyond that"".

&gt; And Germany was effectively dismantled and literally so after WW2.

Not to the ground. They should be happy they didn't receive the Polish treatment aka total partitions.

&gt; Soviet invasion came after Polish government ran to Romania and got themselves arrested.

Still doesn't justify the invasion. Running to Soviet Union you say? After what NKVD did to Poles there? After we saw what happened to the Baltic states?

1656,"The European Union’s Brexit negotiators fear that they are being bugged by the British secret service after the UK obtained sensitive documents “within hours” of them being presented to a meeting of EU officials last month, The Telegraph understands.

A highly placed EU source revealed the security concerns as British negotiators were set to return to Brussels on Thursday to resume Brexit talks.

The two sides remain far apart on the  key issues of customs arrangements and Ireland, with Latvia’s foreign minister warning on Wednesday that the risk of a ‘no deal’ outcome was now “50-50”.

The EU bugging fears were raised at a meeting in the European Council on July 13 by a top member of Michel Barnier’s Brexit negotiating team, according to the source.

Sabine Weyand told EU officials attending the meeting of the European Council’s Article 50 Working Party that “it could not be excluded” that British intelligence had penetrated their meetings, the source said.

The EU fears were spawned after British negotiators obtained the contents of a politically explosive slide presentation almost immediately after they were shared on July 5 - just a day before Theresa May’s crunch Chequers summit.


The slides, the contents of which have been communicated to The Telegraph, contained highly negative European Commission economic assessments of British plans to remain in the EU’s ""single market for goods"".

Within hours, the source said, the UK had lobbied at the “highest level” to block EU Commission plans to publish the slides which would have been widely regarded as a pre-emptive EU strike against the Chequers plan.

The source did not elaborate on what the “highest level” meant, but that day Mrs May was visiting Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, in a hastily arranged meeting at which both leaders agreed that Brexit talks were entering a “crucial phase”.

The UK efforts to suppress publication of the slides were successful - they have not since been published - but the Telegraph can reveal that their contents raise serious questions about the political viability of  Mrs May’s Brexit plans.

The slides warned that leaving the UK free to diverge on services, while promising to remain closely aligned on goods regulations, would give the UK a damaging competitive advantage over time.

According to the source, the slides warned that 20-40 per cent of the value of a car was composed of services, and some 69 per cent of the value of chemicals was related to production and processing methods where the UK would remain free to set its own standards.


The Commission warned that - on the basis of its assessments - the UK alignment in the single market for goods would lead to a “level of erosion in the Single Market” over a 15-year period roughly equal to the impact of a ‘no deal’ exit for the UK - or 8-9 per cent of GDP.

If accepted by EU member states, such assessments would destroy British arguments that the EU should show “flexibility” towards the UK and allow it a measure of “cherry-picking” in the EU’s single market.

The question of how British sources obtained the contents of the slide presentation played into long-held suspicions on the EU side that they were being bugged.


EU diplomats say that the 2013 scandal of the Obama administration bugging the phone of Mrs Merkel destroyed any illusions that allies would not bug each other - with Britain well known to have the deepest links with the US security establishment via GCHQ.

A second senior EU diplomat involved in the Brexit talks made light of Ms Weyand’s fears of British eavesdropping. “To be honest, we have never thought anything different,” he said.

The Telegraph understands that the European Council has taken measures to limit the risk of snooping, with a “fierce new secretary” being placed outside the secure Brexit meeting room to collect mobile phones and other electronic devices from attendees.

The risk of spying appears to be taken seriously by both sides, however, after it emerged last year that David Davis, the then Brexit secretary, had taken to using a snoop-proof Faraday briefcase and swapped his Apple watch for a Garmin to avoid anyone hacking its microphone.

British officials have also been seen to carry their own printers into the EU’s Berlaymont headquarters, admitting that they fear that the EU’s printers might make secret copies of their documents.

Speaking privately, UK officials dismiss the European bugging concerns as “too imaginative”, arguing that there are plenty of sources of good information in the leaky Brussels bureaucracy.

“We don’t need to resort to secret methods,” said one very senior UK official involved in the talks, “there are plenty of friends who will share what is going on anyway.”

Even so, the speed of the July 5 leak clearly alarmed Mr Barnier’s team, the source said, because the slides were not circulated formally to the 27 member states.

The whole of people enrolled into these degrees in hungary was 33 if the numbers people are posting here are correct. Not much to uncover and not many in hungary will care. People outside of the country care more because they have attached personal identity to this unscientific curriculum that produces hyper partisan political activists instead of wise open minded men/women of science. Also, you are assuming a lot about me. 

&gt; If a subject is struck down, it should be by other academics producing valid evidence that the subject is structurally unsound.

Universities have been becoming more and more homogeneous and hyper partisan as time goes since late 20th century. If you put down a paper that can be perceived as anti-genderstudies at best you make a lot of enemies in academic circles and get a warning from administrators. Sometimes you can get booted out through other accusations such as being sexist because of views that fields science should have standards for reproducible rigorous data.

The biggest problem is not that the field is completely unprofessional, low grade producing and citation, banal muck but that it has been made inherently political by its supporters. Any criticism you make is not perceived out of want of better science but out of being some sort of ""-ist"" or demonstrated by your reactions some kind of 15th century christian priest. This has allowed it to have leeway and escape scrutiny that other science fields do not get. It needs to be scrubbed from the university system and then there needs to be a good discussion after on what needs to be done to fix it. In 10-15 years when the hyperpartisan cult-like disciples that infect the field wash out after it being out of the system for a decade we can reinstate it into the uni system and make sure it has rigorous scientific standards set by its administrators and put barriers in place to make it an open-minded varied place that that does not become hyper partisan.",Ireland,/r/europe/comments/971dpy/viktor_orban_moves_to_ban_gender_studies_courses/e497nbn/,jckeller86,1534367588

56% of people think that asylum and refugees take up too much room in the political debate. 79% think that the political discourse doesn't talk about care for the elderly enough, 73% schools and education, 70% affordable living spaces, 62% pensions, 56% climate change and the *Energiewende*.

This is awful.

1774,"It really boils down to money. Money motivates disinformation. Some Americans distort words as a basis for dissent. Media companies tend to be operated by people who need money. Some of them need money bad enough that they won't concern themselves with the ethics of their industry/profession. And so it goes.

""Welfare"" was designed to give needy people money. Simple concept, makes sense on a broad level. Repeat ""welfare"" and ""urban"" and contrast it with ""hard-working"" enough and you've weaponized (and bastardized) the concept.

""Entitlements"" are simply programs, like ""welfare"" and ""medicare"" and ""social security"" that Americans are ""entitled"" to by definition. Work in ""entitled"" and ""urban"" and ""hand outs"" and ""lazy"", then contrast it with ""hard working"" and you've weaponized (and bastardized) the concept.

Liberal networks tend to describe Denmark and (Europe at large) as having a large ""*social* safety net,"" which motivates liberal viewers to agree with the benefits of *social*ism. Conservative networks tend to describe Denmark (and Europe at large) as ""*welfare* states,"" which motivates conservative viewers to oppose the ills of *welfare* and *social*ism. Very little information makes the journey from one side to the other as intended and expressed. We can't help but engage with dissent by tearing it away at the root, and that root is *credibility of the source*. A vicious cycle, to be sure, and the result is....very few disagree respectfully, and very few disagree with a full understanding of what and *why* they disagree.

It's almost a paradox: the voting behaviors of the American electorate are incredibly complex, but the average voter (of any party) has an exceedingly limited and ideological view of what, who, and why the country functions as it does.

I don't exempt myself from this either....there's a lot of shit going on.

The interpreter then filled in the blanks, and suddenly some people became gay in order to increase chances for asylum.

Of course those in charge benefit the most from corruption. However, the people allow this to occur. The people are far more powerful than a handful of elite rulers. People are always governed by a reflection of themselves. Rulers aren’t created in a vacuum, and they don’t hold power in a vacuum.

Did you learn that from school or something? Using wikipedia is completely fine since it is a website to gather up information from various sources.

Statistikdatabasen is a government website? SCB?

&gt;The part afterwards which says it increases to a third doesent even have a citation.

You can use the source and see for yourself, it is there.

&gt;Also I hope you are aware that many hundred thousand of those with a foreign background are from Finland, Denmark and Norway

Yes? Why should I care? In fact it is around 600 000 people from other Nordic countries if you count people born from people of that background. If you count people from third generation you guys have 675 000 people of Finnish descent.

&gt;a huge number are people born to Swedish parents abroad that are moving back

How huge exactly? Please, don't leave me empty.

&gt;make it seem like 25% of Sweden is arab and somali

I never said so nor did I ever make it seem like so.

&gt; In the end of 2017 18.5% of the population was born abroad

Yes if you only count people that were born abroad. The number is around 25% if it's people of complete foreign descent in the second generation (third generation immigrants are left in the dark) but if you add people where one of the parents were born abroad the number is about third of the population. Please note that I used the word ""people of immigrant background"", not immigrants themselves.

1888,"&gt;While FGM severely cripples sexual function,

Who says it cripples? You've now introduced a new term. How do you define cripples? Who gets to decide at what harm threshold we now go from mutilation to crippling? I'm not being pedantic, this is a now a serious term that needs legal, medical, anatomical, and scientific parameters.

Before I get to the good part of discussion I'll address what you've said about the foreskin.

The foreskin is [the most sensitive part of the penis.]( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/Sorrells.gif) Full study [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17378847). Dr. Guest discusses [through examples of the ape family](https://youtu.be/XwZiQyFaAs0?t=41m33s) how the trend of heavily innervated foreskin [is a sign of evolutionary advancement from the lower primate species. It contributes to pair bonding, evolutionarily important for the male to stay and care for offspring.](https://youtu.be/XwZiQyFaAs0?t=46m26s) He also discusses the study above somewhere after the 28 minute mark, so 

This is not a 'subordinate' body part, it's literally evolved to be the primary pleasure part of the penis. 

And sorry to point out but you contradict yourself. You talk of crippling on one hand, and then you talk about the brain becoming habituated on the other. How could it be crippling if our brain just adapts to it? Do we adapt up to a point of harm, but not past that? How much can we adapt to? Remember we have to be exact now, and apparently walk that fine line extraordinarily well. Are you sure we adapt at all? Why should we take that chance when there is simply no need to alter genitals at all?

I hope I've introduced some thinking on your end by asking all these question. I'll explain why after a little more context. Now how is harm proven? Proving something (academically, in a study) is a serious task.  How do we define the harm? How exactly with an instrument, do we measure harm? At what point do we cross the harm threshold? At what point do we *not* cross the harm threshold. What percentage of people does it have to harm before we put a stop to it? 

Here's the crux of it. **None of these are easy to define. That's why the WHO avoids it entirely and says genital alterations need to be medically necessary. Otherwise any consequences at all, measurable or not, is not acceptable and is by definition genital mutilation.** We should ask for proof of NO harm (and I do mean proof) in addition to proving immediate and substantial medical benefit. We start our lives with our genitals and foreskin, there needs to be a *medical* argument to remove it, not to keep it.

Remember that routine circumcisions leads to severe complications for some people and even death, so it's not as simple as taking the 'typical' outcome, we have to consider all the outcomes. Or do we only consider the the 'intent' of the procedure regardless of actual outcome. Another issue avoided by using the WHO's excellent definition.

Those people will not be able to buy as much food and probably won't be able to pay for services and many won't even be able to pay rent. This in turn will lead to shops in poorer areas closing as they can't sell enough which then probably leads to more unemployment combined with an increased crime rate as the people have to make money *somehow*.

2057,"&gt; The harsh attitude towards the boats can be implemented at the national level too though.

Look at it like this: it definitely can, but chances of 'holes' in the system increase a lot, the odds of smugglers finding ways to exploit the resulting collection of separate actions are much bigger and finally it's simply unfair for Northern and Eastern countries to just basically let them Southern countries do the dirty work for them, which will in turn generate tensions.

Basically, the odds of it going wrong increase manyfold, just as it is currently. It's not tenable in the long term.

&gt; That's just what the situation is like and I don't really see that changing in the near future.

The changes in the world will eventually force us. We can either try to be somewhat ready for it or let the current system collapse on us when push comes to shove.

That said, it would be wrong to only have interviews of this kind as it wouldn't allow voters to form an opinion on the parties in general.

I however do think that the AfD is a bit in the same situation like the Pirates were a few years back: Once a single-issue party (and the AfD is pretty much single-issue - migration - at this point) becomes ""mainstream"" (sizeable enough to gain seats in the parliament), it can be expected from them to have a position on the most relevant political topics. This will make them struggle, because in single-issue parties, the opinions on the other issues tend to vary widely.

Not to mention that they can do none of this when coming illegally, because they'll have no work permit.

Yes. That's why I'm sceptical about any of the development and aid programmes that the West direct towards African countries. Even if we manage to help a significant amount of people, there will be still so many of them willing to take the risk.

I mean, eventually, their birth rates might drop, just like they dropped elsewhere in the world as countries develop. In many African countries, they already dropped, although they still remain quite high.

The problem is that it's all happening too late. We can't just wait for this problem to solve itself somehow in the next 50 years or so. Specially not given the climate changes which will only push out more and more people out of Africa. We might even have problems to secure sufficient water resources for us.

The big plus on a high tax social system like Germoney is that nearly everything the government spends on local production comes back into government funding. Lets say for example the government spends a billion on refugee stuff which they spend on local productions. These productions pay taxes, especially for paying their employees, nearly 50% of what they pay immediatly goes back in taxes, makes it only 500 million they spend. Now these employees need stuff like food and shit, for all that they pay around 17% taxes so now it is only around 400 million spend. Now the stuff they buy is spend once again on paying employees etc. resulting in even more taxes and in the end from 1 billion spend, easily 800 million comes back into the government.",,/r/europe/comments/977db4/german_economy_accelerates_against_all_odds/e481u1a/,Mad_Maddin,1534323396

2239,"1. There was a reason the requirements for products and produce was regulated.

2. That doesn't happen anymore.

Because regulating these things are a prime way to protect your domestic market or by accident skew competition. If Italy wants straight cucumbers and Germany doesn't mind, Germans can't sell their cucumbers in Italy, but Italians can in Germany. 

This is the reason the EU made common rules **as soon as one or more members** made up their own rules. In absence of any local or national regulations the EU didn't do shit.

Nowadays we have the principle of equivalent protection and of recognition and we trust each other that if products and produce conform to one member states rules, they conform to all member states rules. So if Italy wants straight cucumbers, that is fine. But Italy has tp trust German product regulation to be just as fine.

Now why didn't they do do before? Because you need cooperation and experience together to trust each other. Italians didn't trust German pasta makers, Geans didn't trust French car regulations. But now, after decades, we have come so far we don't have to regulate minutes details like that anymore, because of the trust and goodwill we build up over decades of working together.

This is a trust that had not yet extended to foreign policy. Nation states want to safeguard their national interest in dealing with third nations.

The biggest democratic deficit within the EU, to the point the EU points it out themselves, is the fact the European Parliament has no democratic initiative, but rather has to demand the European Commission to propose legislation within a set time frame.

But let's also not kid ourselves. Since the member states are reluctant to continue integration, it's only natural that the EU has a much greater accountability than most national governments do. There is not much the EU can do without getting approval from multiple institution and a lot of important decisions still require a qualified majority or even unanimity in the Council. The democratic deficit of the EU isn't in that the EU can take action without adequate approval, but that even with adequate approval it often cannot take action. 

I think we mustn't worry. Over the lifetime of the EU it has gradually become more democratic. It takes time.

2260,"Groups who have been crushed hardest under the boots of certain regime have historically always been represented in higher percentages or indeed even at the forefront of various revolutionary movements. That applies to a thousand different social movements the world over in the span of thousands of years.

But as the saying goes, there is no fire without kindling. Trotsky and Bronstein are not an army, and would've never been able to forcefully depose anyone were it not for the massive support that their ideas garnered from segments of the greater Russian population, a segment which ultimately proved to be much greater than those that didn't, hence why they came out on top.

None of the Bolsheviks have kept their ideology as any sort of security, it was all laid out in the Communist Manifesto and in their speeches, in full radical majesty and daylight. And people flocked to it, when they didn't have to. Because the Tsar was indeed kind of a dick and their families were starving in the winters while bourgeoise were eating cakes.

Would Trotsky or Lenin with a podium and some pamphlets be able to succeed in the United States or UK at the time? Would they draw millions of supporters? We already know the answer is no, the Communist parties did try and failed.

So if anyone has destroyed the western civilization of Russia, it's either the Tsars for governing so badly that internationalist 'Reds' would look like a good alternative to people, or everyone who took up arms to implement the vision of the Bolsheviks as well.

And before you say that the Tsar was already toppled, it was the revolutionary activities of the February revolution which [ultimately led](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_Revolution#Long-term_effects) to the formation of the Soviet Executive Committee which enjoyed greater popular support than the provisional government, and from there to the October revolution.",,/r/europe/comments/974bad/hungary_bans_gender_studies_from_state_run/e482502/,Questiori,1534324082

2298,"&gt; Do even 2% of the people in buses use the WiFi? I don't think so. If they don't have to, most people are too lazy to even activate the available access points.

I certainly do (though I'm not using the bus that often anymore) and I'm sure there are a lot more. As said, especially those who actually have to care about their plan, like schoolkids, poorer people or even those who spend quite a bit of time in places without wifi and would like to keep their limit. 

&gt; Let me give construct an alternative: For those not well of, why not make a deal with the providers to offer additional state funded traffic. That shouldn't cost that much, i bet you can get 1gb of data for 2€ if you sponsor 10.000 people, especially as most won't even use it. That's 20k.
Now for tourists. why not offer a free mobile access point they can get for up to a week for free. My guess would be that 100 are more than enough for a city of 200k people to supply the few tourists with WiFi only devices. At an estimated cost of 100€ per device plus 10€ per month for a data plan that's 220€ per device or 22000 total.

That's really not how it works though. You can't mix extremely local politics like publics transport with nationwide policies, especially not if you actually have to means test them which would amount to endless bureaucracy for a minimal gain. The accesspoint idea amounts to even more troubles. You want your solutions to be easy and working and not having someone checking eligibility  or handing out devices.

The good thing about public wifi is that you can just use it without worrying about anything (but safety maybe) - no matter who you are and where you are from. ",,/r/europe/comments/978f04/new_busses_in_finland_have_usb_ports_now_how_i/e482bm1/,J4yJ4m,1534324497

This whole thread could be a staggering example of that (and yes, it's anecdotes of course, no peer-review and all.. but how would you be going to study such comprehensive nuances plunged in a sea of variables, outside of case studies?)

You are conflating terms. Explicit and implicit bias are not the same thing. Like an example from that thread, a MTF asian getting told by Asian women that they don't date Asian men is not implicit. 

Explicit bias exists. Whether it's justified or not is, however, never examined. Implicit bias can't be shown to exist in action. 

&gt; Sorry, are you like suggesting there's no actual bias (implicit or not) in modern society?

No. I think explicit bias exists and I think that it can be valid. I don't think implicit bias, beyond what explicit bias could tell us, exists since it has not been demonstrated to exist.

&gt; May I call it subtle bias, to differentiate it from patent X-ism, while still having it produce ""observable"" effects?

Explicit bias, i.e. you are aware of it and can or can not act on it, works fine. And no, splitting hairs and pretending that racism and sexism are somehow defined quantities when they are not is not something I will entertain. Explicit and implicit bias works fine.

&gt; Uh? May I ask where you are coming from? You have never seen girls getting reprimanded for playing video games? Boys getting mocked for being effeminate or getting into &lt;insert social science&gt;? And this, putting aside all the harassment thing.

&gt; They are doing the same for nursing and men. Possibly also teaching. (then one could argue ""it's a fraction"", but the funny thing here is that since that unless you pretend the policy makers are masochists with their own gender, I could only their problem being stereotyping their own needlessness of help/support/push)

It's less than a fraction. You are comparing 5.5 million pound program with some lip service and a 10.000 pound scholarship split between 10 students. Not only that, the lip service disregards any male concern relating to entering the field with unsubstantiated views on negative stereotypes. It's a joke.

2425,"&gt; In the case of gender studies, how it is formed/distorted by the relations between genders, oppression, etc.

That's a very good example of what I see as the problem with ""women's studies"" and some of the other forms of ""X's studies"" that have become common on universities. You've made an assumption that there is oppression and since you haven't mentioned anything else I assume that's the major focus of your studies. If you wanted examples of what needs to be studied you could have mentioned differences in physical abilities, cognitive abilities, sexual desires, height, or even weight. 

I've never seen a woman's studies report that focused on anything except how the patriarchy is oppressing women, how the patriarchy *also* oppresses men.

I've also noticed that anytime I'm made aware that someone has taken a class in women's studies, it is always someone who has shown either a complete inability to grasp logic or who has displayed hateful assumptions based on conspiracy theories - and usually it isn't one or the other but both.

I have to admit that I've never taken a women's studies class, but from what I have seen and heard it doesn't sound much different from taking a gentile studies class that focuses on how the rich Jews have oppressed gentiles for generations by drinking their blood. I haven't taken either kind of class and I won't take either kind of class.

2460,"&gt;The state doesn't validate degrees, the university's reputation does. Universities do their own research into what the job market is asking for, they don't need to be told by government what to offer or not offer.

The university is free to continue to hand out degrees for gender studies. The government is simply saying it will not grant any legitimacy to those degrees. In Hungary having a degree grants you certain privileges in the marketplace. These privileges are paid for by the taxpayer. Therefore the government has every right to defend the taxpayer from a useless discipline. Once again: no one is saying you can't teach it. They're saying we won't pay for it. And the fact that you think ""free speech"" means forcing the state to *support* your ideas, shows how entitled and frankly absurd you are. Free speech means the state won't stop you from speaking. It does not mean you are owed *anything* for what you say. 

&gt;Nor does the state speak for the job market - the businesses that comprise the market are free to judge each candidate's qualifications, and they have their own dialogue with universities. And not all university degrees are their to train people for commercial jobs, some are there for entry into further academia and research.

Sound and fury. Businesses are free to hire someone with a gender studies degree whether or not the state considers it. If ""the job market"" is desperate for gender studies majors (ha ha ha) then the job market will continue to tempt them without state support. That's called supply and demand. But you and I know there is no demand.

&gt;There are 11 students taking gender studies, a maximum of 18 is supported. The market is working. The state gives those universities a budget and the universities are satisfying the market for students, academia and industry with it. The state doesn't tell them what brand of pens to buy, it shouldn't tell them what courses they can offer.

I've never heard of a pen that is an ideological cancer, but good analogy. Beyond that, for the last time: the state IS NOT telling them what courses they can offer. The state is saying it will not accept certain courses as part of its market privilege scheme because those courses have proven to be totally useless in the market and downright destructive. Get it? They can continue to teach whatever they like. You just don't get to pretend your ""biology doesn't exist and data is for losers"" degree is worth as much as that guy's engineering degree. 

&gt;The ""job market"" did not tell Orban it thinks 11 qualified gender-studiers is too many for a country of 9.7 million people and it needs legal changes to ensure it is zero.

He's not ""ensuring it's zero."" He's simply removing the training wheels. As said: they are free to keep teaching it. Students are free to take it as an elective. And if the market requires more than zero, then your employer will be happy to hear you have a keen eye for ""gender.""

&gt;What's next? Requiring public universities to enforce a dress code of no blue or purple died hair? A ban on teaching ""degenerate art""?

There it is, the classic liberal projection. He is not requiring anything. He is not banning anything. That is the way you think because you're a petty little authoritarian. If I tell you I am not going to buy you a sandwich, have I stolen your sandwich? Have I required you to buy me a sandwich? No. I have done nothing other than to remove myself from the equation. Learn. The. Difference. Hungary has not said: ""you can't teach this."" They have simply removed taxpayer financing. You are not entitled to other people's money for your Marxist propaganda.

2489,"&gt; You've made an assumption that there is oppression and since you haven't mentioned anything else I assume that's the major focus of your studies. 

Nope. I have not taken GS. I studied literature, there was not even gender studies that time. However, I did have some readings on the subject, because one who studies literature in Hungary must have basic understanding of all major tendencies of liteary criticism, such as phenomenology, structuralism, Marxism, deconstructionism, and yes, feminism. But my ex-GF had GS major (much later, in a private univeristy), and even without that, I tend to not call useless some other field just because I am not specialized in it, or I have no clue about it. 

&gt; If you wanted examples of what needs to be studied you could have mentioned differences in physical abilities, cognitive abilities, sexual desires, height, or even weight. 

You are right. From what I learnt and read, GS exists on the border of other discourses, like racial, political, colonial oppression. It's not jsut about ""EVIL MEN HURR DURR"". In the Eastern Europe, feminism is in a very special position, since the socialist system had a very positive relation towards working women (not so much the current Hungarian christian-right leadership), however, racial minorities, lesbians, trans persons and whatnot were still oppressed. So yes, you are absolutely right, gender is not the only difference that should be taken into account.

[A retired economics professor said](http://meeviren.puheenvuoro.uusisuomi.fi/257288-wir-schaffen-das) this happened because model has been misspecified. 

Authors made assumptions about specification of economic shocks and used Cholesky decomposition: The migration shock affects economic variables instantaneously but shocks in economic variables don't affect migration shocks. The authors assume economic growth has no effect on migration while the reality says otherwise: migrants always seek booming economies. 

This could have been reason why the results are like they are.

2649,"The most important cause of poverty is fast growth of population that can't be followed by needed growth of production. If China was not able to reduce drastically population growth there would have been no economical boom.  
Sorry, but if there will be 2.5 billions of Africans in 2050 there is no way to prevent them from poverty and Europeans are not responsible for them. Europeans are only less then 10% of the world population. There is no time for “a long run”. High reproduction rate is natural as high mortality is natural too; it is about natural balance. Low reproduction rate and low mortality results in biological degeneration, what would be fate of Europeans. High reproduction rate and low mortality results in overpopulation and disaster, what would be fate of Africa. For example Egypt imports 40% of food. If any crisis breaks this import there would be apocalyptic famine having heavy consequences not only for Egypt. 
If you don't understand problem of electrical energy you understand less than nothing about modern world. Majority of people in Uganda have no access to electric energy.  Lack of access to electricity severely constrains any economic development. For example this a very good [butcher shop](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/Butcher_Shop%2C_Uganda_%2815584067667%29.jpg) in Kampala. No refrigerator, but billions of flies... In a countryside shop, meat hangs on a tree, because the shop is in ""open air"". It is possible to buy a smartphone in Uganda but many people have problem to recharge batteries. 
There is not lack of water in the world, but there is lack of drinking water. Also there are large arid territories, in Egypt only 3.5% of the total land area is cultivated and permanently settled. And present draught causes lack of water even in many European countries. It will impact agriculture and world production and prices of food. If such change of weather was permanent it would have led to principal decline of many European states.

You seem to be really struggling with this basic concept. Let me put it in simpler terms so you understand how ridiculous your position is.

- **Peterson**: A McChicken is a Burger, except they replaced the meat with chicken.

- **Rando Youtuber**: Here, Peterson assumes that anything with chicken is a McChicken. This is, of course, absurd. Is Pollo Con Queso a McChicken? Is Chicken Marsala a McChicken? What about turkey, is that close enough to a McChicken.

- **Me**: that's cool and all, but nobody said anything with chicken is a mcchicken

- **You**: Excuse me he's clearly saying that a McChicken is just a burger with chicken right here

2940,"&gt; Is your mind this blinded to accept an obvious hateful, uncivic, barking of loud, wilfully ignorant lies and insults as normality? This is not a partisan issue between one party and another. It's a struggle between truth, civility and integrity on one side and deception, corruption and incivility on the other.

Suggesting Fox is somehow head and shoulders apart from other news/opinion networks is laughable. Sure the worldview, opinions and angle are not the same. But the dumb shit is. There is plenty of hate and willful ignorance to go around and no one has cornered that market. The only thing that makes Fox worse is that you disagree with their particular corporate world view unlike that of CNN/MSNBC.

No, he doesn't. The person I'm responding to cut and pastes a monologue out of a YouTube video that has 0 quotes from Peterson.

The rando YouTube does include clips of Peterson saying ABC, but seeing as how he's attempting to claim he said and means XYZ, those are hardly citations.

&gt;They back up their claims.

Lol. No they don't. That's the joke. 

It's real easy to back up a claim that someone said X or means Y or claims Z. 

All you have to do is quote them saying it. 

&gt;well but I can't find any clips of him saying the things I want people to think he says, even though he has about a million hours of lecture on youtube

2946,"I would like to clarify that we are talking about two very different things in parallel.

-----

The first thing we are discussing is the extent to which empirical evidence informs / plays a role in philosophy and mathematics, and the difference between ""facts"" and ""empirical evidence"". This is extremely theoretical in nature, and I am convinced that, if we take enough time to discuss this, we will see that much, if not all, of our current disagreement is actually over definitions.

&gt; Mathematics is nothing but the study of what you can derive from a set of axiom. This cannot - by definition - be informed by physics.

I 100% agree with this for 100% of the mathematics that you had in mind as you were typing this: Pure mathematics. Of course algebraic topology operates independently of experiments. Except:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_mathematics

If we are talking about fields like e.g. mathematical economics, the question ""does it rely on empirical evidence"" becomes much harder to answer. And a lot of mathematical physics and economics is done in maths departments. So it seems to me that our disagreement is over whether we should include ""applied mathematics"" in mathematics: Purely a matter of definitions.

I could make similar arguments for some sub-fields of philosophy. My guess is that we would find out that  
1. I am including in philosophy stuff that you are excluding from it.  
2. You are drawing a line for the difference between ""facts"" and ""empirical evidence"" at a different point than I am - I am sure we can agree that this line is not as well-defined as it might seem at first.  

I don't think that this specific debate is very relevant to be honest. But if you are hell bent on having this discussion we can do this.

-----

The second point of disagreement is my (admittedly at least partly subjective) opinion that much of gender theory is in open contradiction with basic scientific stuff like e.g. biology, in that many gender theory authors take an extreme stance on the nature versus nurture ""debate"", against all empirical evidence.",,/r/europe/comments/974bad/hungary_bans_gender_studies_from_state_run/e46tocd/,lulzoiaf,1534273296
2947,"That's a really good explanation of one aspect of change. That is a terrible situation that affected those people and a lot of (if not most or all of) it was out of their control.

When I make the example of my mom and her boyfriend, I'm referring to things like gay rights, minorities getting closer to becoming majorities, women taking on larger roles in the workplace, the digital age, etc.

They became adults in the 70's, and reached their peaks in the 80's. For some reason, both of them decided to just stop going along with societal evolution around that time.  That was a decision they made for themselves.

They dwell on the good old days, while their grandkids grow up around them and they are oblivious to all of the good days happening outside of their doors. Nobody pushed them away, they just decided to close themselves off and stop learning about new things. My mom has had late bills because she still insists on writing checks because she thinks online payments are too difficult.

That was tolerable, until the last few years where they finally decided to jump on the bandwagon of blaming the younger generation for making their lives so difficult. They refuse to challenge themselves, while at 36, I've started over 3 times with having had 3 different careers, each drastically different than the other.

2951,"To add in to this, religion plays an important part.

So to convince people to give you their money (tithing) you need to sell them something. If people have everything they need, they don't need religion, at least not as much. If you have healthcare, job security, etc...that means you don't need prayer as much. However when people lose their job, their health, it means you'll see them back in church. Moreover we have a lot of for profit churches, where they talk about how God rewards his followers with wealth.

So you have this group of uneducated, indoctrinated folks and they discover a lump on their throat. They can't go to a doctor because it's not affordable, but their Megachurch pastor claims he can heal them with prayer, he just needs 5 dollars to send you a vial of concentrated holy water. You drink it and feel ""the healing"" but it doesn't last long (placebos usually don't). So they say send me 10 dollars for more water and prayer. So you send it, meanwhile the lump is getting bigger and of course the reason is ""you haven't prayed hard enough, you haven't sacrificed enough to God."" Luckily for you, for $100, he can send you water from Jerusalem. All along it's been regular tap water, of course.

And of course if this person dies, it's ""God's plan"" or ""they weren't ""holy enough.""

Now if you have a competent government, all this wouldn't be necessary, you'd have affordable education, access to medication. That means you don't have to tithe, w/o tithers, there goes your holy slush fund for private jets.

On the tip of that peninsula, there lived the last of the [Livs/Livonians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livonians), the Finnic people, who gave name to [Livonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livonia).

Courland is mentioned in several Estonian folk songs and is known as a very calm and quiet place, almost idyllic. It is the setting of the [Livonian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OG2JWmA_4X8), [Latvian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM0ZZ7ogrfo) and Estonian translation of the originally Livonian folk song *Pūgõ, tūļ* (""Blow, Wind"").

The definition of a colony is when a country is overtaken and occupied by another country.
Icelanders have not settled or overtaken any nations like the British empire has, so calling Vinland a colony is simply wrong, Leif and his buddies traded with natives and left, they were thinking of settling but they weren't settling on land belonging to anyone else.

Things don’t happen because the government has a magic hat of various wizardy that can make anything happen and they refuse to do so because they only want to funnel money to them.

This is what I think generally the problem is, that people think of the government as of everything in a country. I would argue it isn’t as powerful as many assume, not to mention we shouldn’t want that in the long run.

Orban has indeed centralized some powers in terms of legislative power, along with making the already big (imo) government more efficient. He has a good case for that considering the success of Singapore for example.

3085,"&gt; You appear to be unwilling to learn what Gender Studies actually means 

I mostly agree with your definition of what it *means*.

&gt; because of a preexisting ideological slant.

I have none in these matters.  

&gt; &gt; community of people, who adopt particular dogmas, ideologies, and political stances

&gt; You just described every group of humans ever.

Not at all. If you take the community of biologists it isn't a community of people  who as a group, adopts a particular set of dogmas, ideologies, and political stances based on them. 

What I'm saying is more akin to climate change deniers founding a ""climate change studies"" multidisciplinary field, whose sole purpose is to gather and construct evidence for their bias, and promote activism towards their political goals. 

The analogy here isn't that they are as misguided as climate change deniers, that's not the point. Rather the modus operandis in some cases seem to be that: *""We subscribe this ideology, we do a lot activism on this front, and we do some 'studies' that are meant to support our predefined views""*

I'm not saying this is so by definition of what Gender Studies is. I'm saying this appears what it has become in many cases. 

&gt; &gt; who want to influence fields of academia who touch questions related with gender.

I know people who live/ have lived in Rinkeby. I've seen videos of people who were clearly middle-eastern talking about raping white Swedish women, again not all, bot even the majority thinks like that, but it's just probably xenophobic propaganda.

Being gay in Sweden shouldn't be a problem, well in the Muslim majority areas it is. Expressen wrote an article in 2016 about 25 lgbtq+ people currently living or that had lived in these areas, attacked for being gay. Homosexual girl had some guys yelling that the would rape her until she turned right, meaning straight. Maybe it's just xenophobic propaganda.
The alternate pride parade in 2015 or 16 that went through muslim majority neighborhoods got a lot of counter protest. It was seen as an attack while the idea was more about what pride actually is, provocative and aiming for change. Does homophobia fit into Swedish values?

3117,"And governments consistently and regularly ignore that ""responsibility"".  

If you live in a democracy you are one Donald Trump, Adolf Hitler, or Vladimir Putin away from having a government you probably don't agree with, who probably doesn't give a fuck about your welfare.  All three of them were elected in a democracy, all three of them rose to power ""through normal means"".  You are literally putting your faith in the lowest common denominator of society and what they vote for, assuming the elections arn't completely rigged anyhow.  
If you arn't in a democracy but some sort of dictatorship or monarchy, what happens when the next in line simply isn't a good person and history has shown us time and again even if we can have great kings of dictators often times their replacements will never live up and will often be manipulated by the powers that be as they fight for ever more power.  

So no I don't think a government has a ""real"" responsibility to care for peoples welfare.  No more than any other person in the world has a desire to care for peoples welfare.  Even if a noble government existed and did care for peoples welfare it will naturally only be temporary and it will only function by taking from others, and eventually those others will get fed up with it as more and more gets taken.  


To get more back to the issue at hand.  You don't solve housing issues by replacing a landlord with the government.  You are simply trading one pair of shackles for another.  You ""solve"" such issues by creating a situation in which people can actually own property, that bad actors removed from the situation to the most realistic degree available, and so on.  
The government will naturally be involved in that, but not in ""heres a house now pay your taxes"".  It will be involved with keeping out foreign investors from using foreign realestate as investment vehicles, it would be based around heavily (very heavily) taxing ""unused"" realestate so that people can't just sit on owning vacant homes or business realestate.  Create specific zoning regulations about what buildings can and cannot be leased/rented so most ""homes"" cannot be rented or leased but simply bought and sold, while apartments and similar can still be constructed and built since they do serve a useful purpose.  

When you are trying to make something better, you have to remove human nature as much as possible from the equation and go out of your way to think like a scam artists and put roadblocks in their way and patch any of those holes that you might have missed down the road.  Goverment does need to play a role in that, but just having government replace landlords is like the the most stupid idea in the world... it doesn't change of fix the problems you just move from one leech to another more powerful leech you will never escape from outside of a real revolution with bloodshed and destruction.

do you think it would be okay to finance an ""economics degree"" only based on Thatcherism or Marxism with tax money?

according to Wikipedia, they are following Feminist theory a lot, which means 

""Feminist theory focuses on analyzing gender inequality. Themes explored in feminism include discrimination, objectification (especially sexual objectification), **oppression**, **patriarchy**,[3][4] stereotyping, art history[5] and **contemporary art**,[6][7] and aesthetics.[8][9]""

also I accuse the education of legitimizing a 3rd gender which is not acknowledged legally, pretty much all over the world.


The concept of sexuation (sexual situation), which posits the development of gender-roles and role-play in childhood, is useful in **countering the idea that gender identity is innate or biologically determined.** In other words, the sexuation of an individual has as much, if not more, to do with their development of a gender identity as being genetically sexed male or female.[18]

this is also questioning biology.

The stereotype is that theologians work all day studying the same dozen or so holy books and finding new descriptions of supernatural entities from them.

The reality is that theologians study the cultural discourse surrounding religion throughought history, improving our understanding of the role of religion in a variety of fields.

I'm an atheists and I'm a bit unhappy that my taxes (in Finland) are paying for the education of priests. Priests do provide a useful service in many ways, but I'd prefer that the state remain completely out of religion (and vice versa).

I would be against the abolition of the field of theology, though. It would leave sociology and history and a number of other fields without a vital source of understanding for elements of our culture that have a key role in our history.

For me, religion is basically a genre of literature (I've got a degree in literature, so I'm sure you'll understand that I might treat ""literature"" and ""culture"" as somewhat synonymous categories). It's such a major genre of literature, though, that it's quite justified that it has its own specialised field.",Finland,/r/europe/comments/974bad/hungary_bans_gender_studies_from_state_run/e464u9b/,bo-tvt,1534251476

3261,"Well no, not really.

I live in the UK and I'm trying to follow how politics are going here, I always try to compare what politicians say with what researchers and professors from universities says.

And it turns out that basically all agree on Labour manifesto as the realistic and doable one. During the past elections there where a lot ways to look at these things, like BBC Reality Check and BBC Radio 4 program, where on a weekly basis they call professors from universities to ask them their opinion on what ""X"" politician said as something that they want to do.

For example, Labour proposal of raising taxes for the top 5% earners will basically cover up almost all the addional expenses for the NHS. The proposal of changing the Council Tax, to be based on your house size, will help to reduce the housing bubble in the south of England.

Other ideas of Labour have been seen as doable, but they need to provide more details on how they want to them, like the re-nationalisation of the railways and the plan to build an indefinite thousands of new houses.

I get it that a lot of this subreddit sees in a negative way the Labout party because ""MHU SOCIALISM!!1!11"", but that's not the case at all.

What the hell is your point? WW1 has nothing to do with science, and the fact that religion had nothing to do with WW1 does not mean that religion didn't produce mass murder!

&gt; Your argument is somehow that science produces nothing but good while religion and genders studies have done nothing of value. 

Nope. I said what's the ratio of good vs. bad?

&gt; But the Catholic Church was also the leading sponsor for scientific progress up until the French Revolution. Science and mathematics being compulsory aspects of the education of friars and monks. The Middle Ages were dominated by Christian influence yet some of the greatest advances in science were made during this period.

Nope. Religion has historically opposed science, and still does (see Creationism and similar), and rightfully so. If you believe in science, you cannot believe in religion, since science says we don't know what we don't know, religion says what we don't know, God.

Some of the greatest advances in science were made during the Middle Ages DESPITE religion, but the majority of advances in science have been made recently (https://permacultureapprentice.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/technology-growth.png).

In your opinion, our interests are only influenced by biology. Education, culture, parents have no bearing at all on our interests.

I would like to see your scientific source for the fact that. (Though I do think that you are actually right and temperament is essential for our choices.

Essential, as you might know, is not the same as ""soley responsible"". So, by proofing to me that this statement is true:

you have not given proof for your claim that

&gt;It's not less scientific than any other social science.

It is frankly ""anti-scientific"" as what it claims is either a) unsubstantiated, or b) simply the *opposite* of what the data suggests.

3436,"&gt; TL;DR that you get tested positive does not mean that you are still feeling any effect from the drug. Other drugs are not like alcohol, where they measure if you are currently under the influence. Because they are often easier to detect, drug tests often test substances that are created when your body breaks down a drug. 

For the purposes of drugs test for driving, they do test if you are still under the influence (as opposed to having some metabolites in your system)

As you say, weed is detectable in urine for weeks, but they would not take your urine and conclude that even though you smoked a couple of weeks ago, you are committing a traffic offence

If they wanted to make a case against you for driving under influence, then they would have to do a blood test and it would have to show a certain level of the drug, which could be assumed to be having an active effect on you

3456,"&gt;We (quite rightly) resist and attack the idea of white nationalists that they deserve 'self-determination' and their own ethno-state.

First of all, ""white"" is not an ethnicity. Russian, French, German, Italian, Polish, Ukrainian, Serbian, Spanish etc. These are white ethnicities. 

So what, should all these people that respectively created the following states: Russia, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Ukraine, Serbia, and Spain, must dismantle their state and live in one earth without any states? 

I mean, there are far more Nation States than non-nation-states. 

You're effectively talking about removing the right for self determination and statehood to the majority of the world.

&gt;So why do so many people take it for granted that Jews must have their own state, while nearly everyone knows and agrees that the same is repugnant for white people?

So now not only are you racist towards anyone with a white colored skin, but also racist towards Jews. Got it. 

Listen, I don't know if your skin is colored black or yellow or red, but discriminating against people because of their color is WRONG, and you should be ashamed of yourself for discriminating against people of color.

&gt;You're effectively making a Jewish supremacist argument.

And you're making a black/red/yellow-supremacist argument.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-determination

And yeah, keep thinking that Jews are ethnically white. How deluded.

&gt;It was stolen land to create an ethno-state.

I thought you said it was because Jews should be stripped of their basic human right of self determination. 

But alright, I'll bite. Here's a little thing for you to remember - Israel is one of the most ethnically diverse countries in the world, if not THE most diverse. So why don't you take this ""ethno-state"" bullshit, and please yourself anally from it?

&gt;The original inhabitants were kicked out so your people claim it as your home instead.

My people? Sorry but the Russkies only kicked out the Germans. So what are you talking about? 

My people... Racist much?

&gt;If Richard Spencer and his minions took over Madagascar and displaced the Madagascans currently living there, could their children and grandchildren then attack any detractors in 2080 for anti-whiteism and for not allowing them self-determination?

I dislike arbitrary moral rules put on humans by humans, acting as if they are the absolute moral truth. The difference between the rules of Christianity and the rule of Law, is that the Law is disputable, it's arguable, it's usually based on reason, facts and empirical, rational thought. Even then - the rule of Law rarely tries to push ''morality'' on you. You are free to live as a human being without repercussions. The Bible implies that if you live outside of arbitrary moral boundaries you will be sent to burn forever in a lake of fire. Not for hurting others and doing bad to them - for your own conscious life choices that do not impact others.

I have elucidated on just *how* wrong you are, by providing examples of the prosecution LGBT still faced, decriminalization notwithstanding, since the new legal code that came into force in 1961, still allowed legal persecution of them. It was a decriminalization only because the previous civil code was supersede by a new one, that *expressly allowed continued discrimination*. On top of that, I mentioned the types of discrimination and persecution both formally, (losing their jobs at state companies) and informally (public smear campaigns) the LGBT faced.

You seem to be under the idea that because homosexuality was decriminalized, the communists were neutral to homosexuals.

3564,"**A group of nine Tunisian men and two boys found on a small boat in the Mediterranean yesterday have refused the help of a humanitarian rescue vessel, reasoning that they have a better chance of making it to Italy by themselves.**

The group had been at sea for two days and were low on food and water when they were found by the Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF)/SOS Mediterranee ship Aquarius, but rejected offers to board the ship on the grounds that they didn’t know where and when it would disembark, according to reports from [La Repubblica](http://www.repubblica.it/cronaca/2018/08/13/news/aquarius_e_il_soccorso_rifiutato-204002144/?ref=RHPPLF-BH-I0-C8-P1-S1.8-T1).

""Thank you, but we're going to Lampedusa,"" they reportedly told the humanitarian workers aboard the ship.

MSF staff provided the group with additional food, water, and life jackets, and after confirming that there were no medical emergencies, left them to continue on with their journey.

The Aquarius was already in its second day at sea and carrying 141 rescued migrants, the majority of them [Somalian and Eritrean](http://www.repubblica.it/cronaca/2018/08/12/news/migranti_l_appello_di_nave_aquarius_i_governi_ue_ci_assegnino_un_porto_sicuro_-203954006/), when it was directed towards the boat by the Libyan Joint Rescue Coordination Center.

The rescue ship is now looking for somewhere to dock within the EU, but has so far been turned down by Spain and Malta.

Italy has not responded to the ship’s latest request, but Italy’s far-right interior minister Matteo Salvini previously issued a blanket statement that he would not allow any more humanitarian rescue ships to dock in the country's ports.

The Aquarius's MSF coordinator, Aloys Vimard, [said](https://www.corriere.it/esteri/18_agosto_12/aquarius-cinque-navi-hanno-ignorato-migranti-difficolta-60e57dfa-9e2c-11e8-89df-b6a0ee1ba25d.shtml) the rescued migrants currently on board the ship told staff that they had been passed by five other vessels, none of which had offered any help, before they were picked up by the rescue boat.

“It seems the very principle of rendering assistance to persons in distress at sea is now at stake. Ships might be unwilling to respond to those in distress due to the high risk of being stranded and denied a place of safety,"" Vimard said in an official MSF statement.

In June the Aquarius spent [nine days](http://www.repubblica.it/cronaca/2018/06/17/news/migranti_aquarius_arrivi_valencia-199225504/) at sea with 630 rescued migrants on board after both Italy and Malta refused it entry, before it was finally allowed to dock in Valencia.",Spain,/r/europe/comments/97685r/men_found_at_sea_refuse_rescue_ships_help_we_want/e45t0gn/,nibaneze,1534230268

3578,"**In a clip that has been widely shared on social media, a host on US television station Fox Business Network has claimed Danes are work-shy and slow at finishing their education, and likened the Scandinavian country to crisis-hit Venezuela.**

The claims were made by Trish Regan, a host on the cable news channel, which is owned by the Fox News Group.

The clip, which has currently been seen over 1.6 million times on Facebook, begins with images of anti-government demonstrations in Venezuela.

“It’s a really horrible scene. No food, no healthcare, no jobs. Lots of violence, lots of looting, lots of corruption. This is what socialism looks like in Venezuela, and you know what, it’s getting worse,” the presenter says at the beginning of the monologue.

“But you know what? Democrats say ‘we’re not talking about Venezuela’ when they talk about socialism, they say ‘we’re talking about Denmark!’,” Regan goes on to say, before continuing, “as Shakespeare said, ‘there’s something rotten in Denmark’.”

That is a misquote of Shakespeare, but it is far from the only misleading element of Regan’s report.

“Denmark’s freebies are anything but free,” the cable news host says before claiming the Scandinavian country’s “top federal tax rate \[sic.\]” is 56 percent.

“In other words, everyone in Denmark is working for the government!” Regan then asserts.

While taxes in the Scandinavian country were last year [reported to be the highest of any developed country by the OECD’s economic thinktank](https://www.thelocal.dk/20171124/denmark-still-has-worlds-highest-taxes-report), they are not as high as reported by Fox Business.

When income taxes, social security contributions, taxes on property, goods and services were all added together, they accounted for 45.9 percent of Denmark's overall earnings in 2016 – the same as the proportion recorded in 2015, but below the peak of 48.6 percent reached in 2014.

Danish Minister of Finance Kristian Jensen offered his response to Regan’s claims via Twitter on Monday.

“So Danes don’t wants \[sic.\] to work? 11 places better than US in OECD statistics! We are working much more than Americans and at the same time ranking as the world’s best in Work-Life-Balance. You should come to Denmark if you dare be confronted with facts,” Jensen tweeted at the Fox host.

Regan also declares in her Venezuela comparison that only three of Denmark’s 98 municipalities had employment levels over 50 percent in 2013.

“And no-one wants to work,” she says without offering any evidence to support that claim.

According to Statistics Denmark, the national employment rate in 2013 was just under 67 percent for people in Denmark between the ages of 16 and 67. It has since increased to 70.1 percent for people of wage-earning age.

That compares to American employment figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics of 58.7 percent in mid-2013, and 60.5 percent according to latest numbers, Danish news agency Ritzau reports.

Next in Regan’s sights is Denmark’s state student grant, Statens Uddannelsesstøtte (SU), which partially covers living costs for people in full-time higher education.

“School’s free. University’s free, that’s lovely. They have a programme there, it’s supposed to take you five years. But you see, not only is school free, they actually pay you, basically 990 dollars a month to go to school – not bad, eh? Well, you know what happens then? Nobody graduates from school, they just stay in school, longer and longer and longer,” the host says to camera.

A March 2017 [analysis](https://www.dst.dk/da/Statistik/nyt/NytHtml?cid=28378) by Statistics Denmark shows a significant fall in the average length of time spent in higher education by Danes in recent years. The average time to complete a Master’s degree programme in Denmark fell by three months between 2012 and 2016, while Bachelor’s degree programmes fell slightly to an average duration of just over 36 months – or three years – from start to finish.

That reflects [policies](https://www.dr.dk/nyheder/indland/klippekort-fjumreaar-og-8000-kroner-om-aaret-saadan-har-suen-udviklet-sig) by both the current centre-right government and its Social Democrat-led predecessor to significantly reduce the amount of time young people spend in higher education, in part by introducing stricter rules on SU.

Regan also claims in the Fox Business report that “one person who studied Denmark” said “all the kids graduating from school in Denmark, they wanna start cupcake cafés.”

According to a March 2018 [government report](https://www.regeringen.dk/media/4985/hele-rapporten.pdf), 2015 figures show just under 90 percent of eligible people holding Master’s degrees were in employment by their second year following graduation, while Denmark has the eighth-highest employment rate of all OECD member countries for people aged 25-64 with Master’s degrees.

Since 1985, employment levels of people with Master’s degrees have been equal or higher to the overall national employment levels, according to the same report.

“Denmark, like Venezuela, has stripped people of their opportunities,” the Fox Business host concludes.

Factual inaccuracies aside, the aim of Regan’s monologue seems to be to prove that the social welfare model on which Denmark is governed makes it a ‘socialist’ country with a system comparable to Venezuela, rather than the market economy it is in reality.

3646,"I am pretty sure he said the family was the source of bourgeoisie culture. Don’t be obtuse. Gender Studies is a weird outgrowth of universalism and egalitarianism, and a rather left wing field even for universities. These aren’t mere details, they travel on the same wavelength and antecedents to the ideas found in Gender Studies can be found in Marx himself and certainly thinkers following his tradition. Surely we don’t think Marxism stopped when he died right?

It is fair to say “Marxist roots” in my estimation. There is a robust connection to the school of thought spawned by Marx and even his own work holds a fair bit of it.

Nah, that's fair. World leaders shouldn't gloat like that or do Twitter policy at all ... the times we live in eh :/.  
Criticism on the US is very fair at the moment, but I'm just wary that for many it's used to clear Turkey of any blame and some of the conspiracy theories can be quite far fetched. It's sometimes interesting to browse /r/Turkey and translate some of the comments too.

&gt; Lastly I am sorry your experience regarding Turks and Turkey have been so negative. The diaspora can be a culture shock for mainland Turks when we travel abroad however I am not too keen on generalising still. Respect for the host country and awareness of being essentially guests should be always present. I hope when things improve you may be able to visit sometime to experience the hospitality and kindness I know many posses.

I respect your greatly for not judging me for it! And I do have to make one thing clear: I do have friends in Istanbul who are not that different from young educated people anywhere else, all CHP though haha. They in no way ressemble the diaspora I grew up with, that's for sure, except for their food preferences

I definitely do not want to generalize every Turk, and even acknowledge that in some respect the culture difference between a young and educated liberal Turk and our own youth can be smaller than the culture difference between us and those 1 or 2 generation older than us in our own countries :) Unfortunately, young educated liberal people are a smaller minority there than here.

3807,"Yes, that's why. The typical American job involves business and/or computer technology, such as running around at the New York Stock Exchange or sitting in a cubicle making pie charts on Excel, so they need to use the internet. That contrasts with the typical Italian job, which is pressing olives or the pasta factory where most workers don't need to use the internet. It's similar in France where people spend their days stomping around on grapes or baking bread, places like Switzerland where they manufacture clocks or precision tools, Germany where they make cars and even on their break they play offline games like Forklift Simulator, Austria where they make knock-off kangaroo meat, Scotland where they are sheep herders, Wales where they produce sheep-themed adult movies for the Middle East, Ireland where they produce alcohol and then drink half before exporting it, Sweden where they make Afro-Dildos, Norway and Portugal where despite being on opposite ends of the wage spectrum they all work in fish canneries, England where they make halal products mainly for internal consumption, Denmark where they spend their days baking those cookies I like, Finland where they make mobile phones and garden tools, Netherlands where they make ~~hookers and~~ weed, Romania and Bulgaria where they make hookers, Belgium where they make small batches of beer and chocolate, Albania where they ""produce"" cars from other countries, Latvia and other random places where they occasionally make something and then you read the label, see ""Made in Latvia"" and quietly say to yourself ""hm, interesting""; the rest of Eastern Europe (all those countries are pretty much the same) where they manufacture armaments in a dreary factory while some type of manager reads off motivational slogans from a megaphone to motivate the workers, all the little Serbian countries like Serbia and Croatia that buy those armaments for their pointless wars, and of course places like Spain and Greece where they just don't really do anything at all.

Geography.  Russia was the closest thing the US had to an ally in the 19th century, because both countries were (and may be) threatened by a powerful Europe.  The US supplied Russia in the Crimean War, and Russia kept the Europeans out of the US Civil War.  Russia also sold Alaska to the US so we could keep the British from dominating the Bering Strait.

The two nations are also a lot alike, large, multi-ethnic frontier nations.  And both have old democratic traditions, despite what some think.  Most Russians until the early 20th century lived in communes.

A state is like a HOA. It provides you services that benefit you, whether you want them or not and forces you to pay for them. And sure, sometimes some corrupt people on the board skim off the top to line their pockets, but it's absolutely not comparable to a Mafia.

Sure states are shit, you're not special to have made that discovery, it's plainly obvious to everyone. But your suggestion to fix it is just way worse.

3877,"I see you didn't understand my message. 

Romanian society has big problems. After the failed nationalism of the Ceausescu era came a period of self hatred and doubt in the 90s and 2000s and to some extent today.

Our leaders seem to not care about us, at all. Every xenophobe in western Europe can call Romanians whatever he wants and you won't hear a word from our leaders, no representation whatsoever, [sometimes they join in the insulting too.](https://www.digi24.ro/stiri/actualitate/evenimente/ioan-rus-despre-romanii-din-diaspora-au-poate-1-500-de-euro-salariu-de-banii-astia-copiii-se-fac-golani-acasa-si-nevasta-sa-curva-402882)

The problem regarding our leaders is something else, another more complicated subject, that will haunt us for the foreseeable future.

Now if our leaders aren't standing up for ourselves and our rights, maybe we should do it ourselves.

I used to have a very bad opinion on Romania and Romanians, because to be honest as a kid growing up in the 2000s that is what you learned. You learned that Romania is shit and the western world is a paradise.

Now I've been on the internet for a decade and I've seen that things aren't quite like that, the Western World is full of idiots just like home.

But all that self hatred of the 90s and 2000s will stay with us for decades and will drag us down. Now some self reflection and criticism is fine, but we had too much, and in some ways in the wrong areas, it was not productive criticism.

Why do I say all this? Because all this negativity affects a society just like it affects a person. Romania right now is a society suffering from depression. 

Lots of good people feel like there is no hope in this country and leave to somewhere where they think their efforts will be better appreciated.

People feel like there is no real society here, like everyone is pulling for themselves, rather than for the common good.

It is a tragedy that we think like this and a lot of potential is being lost.

In a society such as this people are discouraged from creating, thinking it is all for nothing.

However we will get out of it, but we have to start believing in ourselves, we have to stand up for ourselves. 

Only through this positivity can we evolve economically and culturally, that is what I believe.

In time our reputation will improve, our politicians will improve, our society will get itself out of the hole we are currently into.

After all how can you be respected by others if you don't respect yourself? And how can you respect yourself if you let others insult you and bring you down?

The EU parliament is one of the best things about the EU. Normally multinational trade deals, that also affect local laws, would be discussed in private behind closed doors, with minimal input from the people.


With the parliament, there are democratic elections to pick who we send to these negotiations, and then the negotiations have to happen in *public* and they get televised. During the entire process we get to watch and even call in to our representative.

This article shows my opinion pretty well. 

&gt;If we make this maximum choice, we should understand the price we will have to pay. The cost will be incalculable in both lives and treasure. And we shall have accepted the burdens of Europe, not for a year or a few years, but for generations.

Understand that USA pre WW2 was highly peaceful and isolationist. Washington's doctrine of ignoring European affairs served America very well for the last 150 years.  

Yes, it was in USA's self interest that Germany thrive and succeed, but I ask you how many countries would have done the same and ignored revenge tendencies with the most evil countries in all of history by far (Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan) ?

How about WW1 when Germany was defeated? USA wanted global peace and didn't want revenge. Peace without victory. If Germany won they would have enforced something much harsher than the Treaty of Versailles on the allies. Look at the treaty of brest-litovsk for context. History shows that USA was too kind towards Germany, and that France should have been allowed to annex the Rhineland.


So yeah USA got over the feelings of revenge for the greater good, which includes all of Europe and the USA. No country would be blamed in a historical context if they chose revenge. Germany deserved it 10000000000000 times over.

http://www.wahlrecht.de/umfragen/politbarometer/stimmung.htm

The initial jump was about dislike for Gabriel and I guess you could say hope of a change in the SPD. That secondary jump however was a reaction to the strong start. It did not follow reporting of Schulz being more to the left but by reporting of Schulz being a surprisingly strong choice as a candidate.

His decline later was not initiated by him making clear that he is centrist, but by the weak showing of the SPD in the state elections in NRW which was a local problem with Schulz being largely uninvolved.

You've only seen tidbits of information, and you somehow think you're well informed.

That's exactly why I am arguing. Basically, no one on this subreddit knows whats up. The only ""source"" is this random snapchat-like ""news report"" which doesn't even pretend to be impartial.

I am on no one's side. But whenever some issue pops up where everyone acts like its ""good vs evil"", I like to argue against it. The world isn't black and white. And the self-righteousness of Reddit is cancer.


&gt;How can you give the benefit of the doubt to the government over the people is beyond me...

Because you live in a Democracy. The government is the representation of the people. While according to the Democracy index Romania is a flawed democracy it still ranks 61th of 167 Countries. On the Corruption Perceptions Index, it ranks 57th.

Yeah, it's not great but its still a functioning democracy. You are a member of the NATO and EU. You aren't some African country ruled by the military. You have Elections. 

Next Year. You can vote for a new leader. You even can elect the president directly so he doesn't even have to be of the ""political establishment""

In violation of maritime law, the Geneva Convention for refugees and that ""code of conduct"" the EU **under italian leadership** forced those NGO's to sign, which forces them to bring them to european shore.

&gt;arrest the traffiker

Who? You mean the captain, who's obligated by maritime law to take in people? 

It's almost like you don't want to neither know nor follow the law.

[Here](http://www.euronews.com/2017/08/03/text-of-italys-code-of-conduct-for-ngos-involved-in-migrant-rescue) is the text of that code of conduct, the important thing for you:

&gt;The NGOs that subscribe to this Code of Conduct undertake the following commitments: in accordance with relevant international law, commitment **not to enter Libyan territorial waters**, except in situations of grave and imminent danger requiring immediate assistance and not to obstruct Search &amp; Rescue by the Libyan Coast Guard

[Here](https://international-maritime-rescue.org/10-news/1887-migrant-rescue-at-sea-the-legal-context) is the important part of maritime law for you:

&gt;Every State shall require the master of a ship flying its flag, in so far as he can do so without serious danger to the ship, the crew or the passengers, **to render assistance to any person found at sea in danger of being lost**, [and] to proceed with all possible speed to the rescue of persons in distress, if informed of their need of assistance, in so far as such action may reasonably be expected of him [...]

Note the ""**any**"" in there.

And [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_Relating_to_the_Status_of_Refugees) the part about the Geneva Refugee Convention:

&gt;The contracting states shall not

&gt;* expel refugees (Article 32)
&gt;* **forcibly return or ""refoul"" refugees to the country they've fled from** (Article 33).
&gt;* impose penalties on refugees who entered illegally in search of asylum if they present themselves without delay (Article 31), which is commonly interpreted to mean that their unlawful entry and presence ought not to be prosecuted at all

Those aren't the same things. Attending the victims of Munich terrorist attacks won't balance out commemorating the terrorists who murdered them. 

Any decent person is expected to feel sympathy for victim of terror attacks. But a person who commemorate those murderers is at best sympathetic to the actions, tactics and behavior of the terrorist organizations.

4166,"&gt; I think ITER is a waste of time and the money can be better allocated

Not a straight answer but I guess I'm not getting one on that question.

&gt; If someone wants to do fusion research - fine, I'm all for it - but do it on a smaller scale at this point in time.

But why? why does it need to be smaller scale?

&gt; That's the usual trick. 'Rational arguments' don't exist.

What the...

&gt; If you believe in 'rational arguments', 'merits of the matter' and pure 'technical' reasoning on your side, then I have a surprise for you: it does not exist.

I'm baffled by what I'm reading. You know you're representing the worst stereotypes about environmentalists right now?

&gt; I thought this is known by now and taught in universities? 

No, I'm not aware of universities that teach that arguments don't have merits and technical considerations are not a thing. Kind of the opposite I would say, especially in highly technical matters like energy supply.

&gt; &gt; Fusion is precisely a technology

&gt; Energy production with Fusion reactors is precisely not just a technology.

Did you just awkwardly cut up my sentence to try and interject with something it evidently didn't mean and would have been ungrammatical in the way you've represented it? come on now.

If this is what you resort to then maybe you should consider that your belief isn't backed up by sufficiently strong arguments.

&gt; It is the specific vision of a energy producing landscape: reactors, politics, economics, sizing, government structures, money allocation, possible business plans, safety, etc etc.

No, fusion reactors are a technology. The political landscape and even the power grid design in which they could be utilized are a whole other matter that's absolutely worth discussing, but they're not one and the same thing.

Ultimately you've failed to convince me of the Green's objections to ITER, in fact this discussion mostly reinforces my impression that this is far more due to the political inertia of the anti-fission fight than anything else.",Italy,/r/europe/comments/96y8pe/greens_overtake_afd_in_the_latest_voting/e44nunk/,SuonatoreJones,1534187064

4258,"&gt; What? No. Look at the first Two sources I provided to you. Italy is first in europe, France is second.

Yes, Italy is the biggest **hub** in Europe and 3rd globally where luxury brands sell. France is second in Europe. Do you think Japanese being the top luxury market means it's Japanese luxury brands that allowed them to get to the top? Same for Dubai in the top 10? Do you think Chanel or Gucci only sell in their respective countries? 

Come on, think about it for a second, process the information. You're gonna understand.   

&gt; Dude, this means that Italy has MORE brands, while France has BIGGER brands.

Now you're just making stuff up. Like, literally. Nowhere does it say Italy has more brands. Italy is just behind. Literally every number tell you this, I gave you quotes that say word for word that Italian companies **average revenue is €1.2bn, while French companies register four times that on average**.

&gt; So the average luxury company of Italy sells less than the average company of France. But overall, Italy is ahead.

Overall all Italian luxury companies listed by Deloitte don't even sell as much as LVMH alone. You're embarassing yourself at this point.

&gt; Don't underestimate France, it' very close to Italy: only a bit behind. 

As Deloitte said, Italy is way too small and far behind to even be considered competing with France, so I'd advise you to stop overestimate Italy ;)

As usual, it depends on the context. If it's a natural decline due to economic factors fine. But if its due to a dicktator taking financial control(refuses to raise interest rates despite record inflation) over the country(Brother in law as head of the federal bank) and starting economic wars with the USA then its very bad. 

So yes, it's not inherently bad, but in this case, it's VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY bad.

That was the case when the price per barrel was over $100. At this point, it's so-so. Producing oil from shale is more expensive, and to break even the price of oil needs to be over $50-60.

That is the main reason OPEC cut the prices few years ago to 40, as American oil was eating a big chunk of its main market. KSA can easily lower the price to 20 and still make profit, while American shale can't compete with that.

I haven't driven on Maltese roads. You said the EU profits as a whole. But in that case only the state that sold the citizenship profits. 

Non-citizen residents also have to pay taxes. 

Why is there a need to grant these people citizenship? Malta is selling entry tickets to the EU. These people don't buy Maltese citizenship to stay in Malta. And Malta is fully aware of that. 

That's also why Malta has a ridiculous definition of residency. You only get Maltese citizenship after being a resident for one year. 

In Malta being a resident is defined as living in the country for more than half a year each year. That's how it is in other countries as well. 
But Malta offers a cop-out for people who want to be Maltese residents but really hate Malta. If you fly to Malta to rent an apartment and keep that rent contract for a year you are considered a resident as well. You can leave the day after you've rented your apartment and don't have to return.

4814,"&gt; NATO bombed us

Like I said, they hardly did anything. They should've *bombed you more*, maybe atrocities like Srebrenica could've been prevented.

&gt;Assad is killing people left and right, and nobody does shit, he gets to win.

That's mostly because Assad has Russian troops and equipment backing him up (though, it's not like Russia could ""bully"" the US into doing something, no way at all). No way in hell America is touching Assad, especially not with Trump at the helm. Besides, Assad being in power *helps* America, letting Serbians doing whatever the fuck they want in the Balkans doesn't really help American interests there.

&gt;So do the separatists in Ukraine and Georgia

We literally have zero reason to care about Ukraine and Georgia. Zero. Neither are in NATO and are mostly out of the way. Maybe you could say letting Russia seize Crimea ""hurts"" us, I guess? But the United States still has an overwhelming advantage over Russia when it comes to their navies, so it's a moot point. Crimea isn't everything. And Georgia is nothing to us, they might as well be a Russian province far as we're concerned.

&gt;Really, what's a little genocide in a Balkan shithole compared to that?

True, but the thing is, unlike genocides going on in the Middle East (Saudi-backed genocide in Yemen, and we won't lift a finger to stop it either) we have the means, ability, and the cause to stop it. We literally have a base in Kosovo (manned mostly by UN troops, true, but it still operates with the United States army) to stop the Serbians from trying something stupid, what makes you think we won't stick our noses in Bosnia (again) this time?

&gt;Russians aren't afraid to show teeth

They are once the trade embargoes start rolling in. There will come a time when Europe won't rely on Russia's natural gas supply, they'll be looking straight to American imports for all their gassy needs, and watch Russia implode from just that alone. Besides, [we already killed 200 of them in Syria earlier this year](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-13/u-s-strikes-said-to-kill-scores-of-russian-fighters-in-syria).

4818,"Lan Xang

The begining of the week started the most catostrophique way possible. An alliance had been established prior to this with 6 SEA nations Ayuthaya/Mong Yang/Lang Xang/Malacca/Brunei and Madyas ( Philipinne ) . 

Because of urgent IRL matter that expressly needed my intention ( going to a festival ) I myself could not be present that day but I had selected a vice king to rule in our stead in the meanwhile who then got crowned king of ayuthaya .The emir of Malacca brought in a new player for Brunei and because of miscomunication and other problem ( mostly with no one ever responding for over an hour to brunei's enquiry ), the emir of brunei decided to go in ""fuckt it "" mode, broke alliance with every SEA nation, converted to sikhism and fought with another SEA member Madyas. This meant none of the objectif planned was accomplished, the secret partition of India map done with the Timurid was leaked and not only that, there were no help given to our ally Timmurid who had to cede land to dehli whom had managed to unite some indians in the attempt to stop the planned partition of India by both the timurid and the SEA. 
And finaly the express plan put in place to either kill Vijaynagar or greatly reduce him failed, the king of Vijayanagar that hoped to cooperate with ourself but was turned down initialy, now forced me to look at him seriously and take a very important decision. 

In the end after an internal vote the  kingdom of Vijaynagar got adopted by the SEA and to truly make him a member, the island of Sumatra was officialy recognised has his, thus Vijayanagar became an official member of the SEA block. But the emir of Malacca weither out of anger, jealousy and other negatif emotions that he couldn't let go against the king of Vijayanagar contacted secretly in our back Dehli/Orissa and Malwa to form a coalition against Vijay. But it would seem that this was seen has a joke by the indians whom themself told the king of Vijay perhaps in an attempt to showcase to him that SEA was not reliable by the fact that a member was secretly ploting to kill him and thus with this they probably hoped to either recruit him in their ranks or at least diminish trust and sow discord in the SEA alliance. But perhaps they didn't expect this, but the king of Vijayanagar instead of geting angry against the SEA instead contacted me, showed me all he say and said "" See I told you the emir of Malacca is an idiot"". 

I had defended the emir of Malacca up until this point, this had crossed my botom line, he had just betrayed the entire alliance, since Slaying was voted in by a vote of 4 against 1 with myself just observing. I convened every member, after talking to them personnaly 1 by 1 another vote was cast this time it was 4/4 in favor of killing the emir of Malacca for his betrayal or at the minimum pushing him out of the alliance, the asian guillotine had to fall, there were too many proof that I couldn't look away from anymore. The announcement was given and it was thus decided that the emir would be banished from the alliance to show what happens to people who betray. It was uter confusion for me since I had planed to give him alot of land, and way more land than he could hope for, but Sumatra haunted him, he wanted his revenge, he had thus put his own desire before of the alliance . It was later revealed to me once the emir of Malacca calmed down that he got lured by the grand King of Malwa who used his hate and just forgot all the rest that was given to him in compensation ( this was not personaly verified by me, so this could be made up like it could be the truth ). 

its in this climate that this session started. The emir of malacca was thus banished but ironacaly he allied Japan and sold out all of our plan, in exchange he was suposed to get Japans protection, but once Japan got the information it wanted, it didn't protect at all malacca and left him to die, the poor emir of Malacca had been again duped and died like this. This assured that all our plan in the Japanese/Chinese region were twarted with the 3 east asian nation of Japan/Korea and Oirat being highly wary of SEA. 

We thus turned towards India, a double war was waged against Orissa in 1 war, and Dehli/Nepal/Bengal and Yarkand in another. It was hard fought, because of an event Orissa managed to get over 5 in morale for his troops while we had in general between 3 and 3.5, thus an incredible scene of 35k brave orissa men repelled a combined force of 80 k happened in front of our eyes, it was valient, but it was followed by enormous amount of miscomunication between Dehli and Orissa where they each reinforced too late in the following battles thus securing us wins we didn't expect to get. We were playing a defensif war since at the time it was 1510 and we knew that the Timurid would come in 1513 once he got out of Bankruptie. But our unexpected win secured us an earlier win, and the war was won, Orissa was split between the king of ayuthaya and the king of vijaynagar. Mong Yang who transformed into Tibet took most of Nepal from Dehli and united most of Tibetan. 

But just before the end of the session when all was going well catastrophe stroke me again ( why you hate me so much ? ), I got checkmated for the first time this campaign ... by an AI, Ming declared on me and I had no other option but to cede 6 provinces and give 600 gold, I had been trying to get back to becoming a tributary of Ming ( broken by the vice King last week )before this war happened but it would seem I wasn't of ""vital interest to Ming anymore"" thus couldn't become his tributary, but once he took my lands and my money, Ming offered me to become his tributary and I could only accept ... fml . I had been had by the only opponent I didn't plan against an AI... PREPARE YOURSELF MING YOUr GOING TO GET IT SOON AND YES AM SHOUTING AT AN AI !!! FUCK MING !!! ( perhaps I should have sent general @theweirdone to defend my frontier, I am sure my good friend the Sultan of Memeluke is in full agreement with me here ).

Ahem apart from this most of our plans were realised, now my kingdom demands revenge against this bot shm . Anyway congratulation and ggwp to all SEA member whom performed admirably, plus the little ruler of Japan has started to taunt the king of Lan Xang ^^^, next session will probably be an exciting one .

4926,"&gt;Man the rest of the world owes us so much

Printing Press, Fiat Currency, Compass, Algebra, Gunpowder - the staples of the era of Colonization and Mercantilism, none of them originated in the west, and 4/5 originated in China. 

It took a number of global convergences and unique social organizations; ones chiefly facilitated by economics and trade - to spark industrialization. The Ancient Romans and Chinese could have industrialized at any point in their history, but they didn't due to a variety of economic and social factors, which didn't reach convergence with the will to do so up until the 1700's in Central Europe due to very specific goods and workforce constraints. 

Technology itself was not the spark-all of the requisite technologies had existence for millennia. It was the way people did business and chiefly where people did business and with what they had to work with. 

Keep in mind the Germanic tribes which inherited so much Roman/Greek technology and organization post-western roman imperial collapse; and which would go on to to create most of the existing western European nations, fumbled around for over a millennium, unable to get their shit together or even reach Roman living standards up until the 1500's.

4936,"&gt; No, its been debunked and ripped to shreds by the experts and scientists in the field.

I've looked into studies on the Intelligence journal and found nothing of sorts. If anything, I found a GWAS study that *confirms* that race and IQ are correlated. 



If you don't believe me, [read Richard Hailer's article about it](https://quillette.com/2017/06/11/no-voice-vox-sense-nonsense-discussing-iq-race/). This man is the editor-in-chief of Intelligence, which I keep referencing because it's one of the top journals that focus on human intelligence.

So unless you're claiming that the editor-in-chief of Intelligence is unscientific and not an expert, there's nothing much to discuss unfortunately.

&gt;SH just does what he always does: goes on about how ""pc-leftists dont dare to admit its true! Forbidden knowledge!"".

You clearly haven't listened to his podcast episode with Ezra Klein. Ezra Klein does not dispute the truthfulness of The Bell Curve. He vaguely states that ""it may not be true"" (can't recall the exact words) but they don't take that path in their conversation.

Ezra Klein's position is, and I'm being as charitable as I can, is that such topics should not be studied, because historically they have been used as an argument for racism.

To reiterate; they did not discuss whether the book was true or not. Harris claimed that the claims made in the book are already widely accepted facts (a statement that Richard Hailer agreed with), and that was it. Klein did not push back. This doesn't mean Klein thinks the book is truthful; it means that Klein's main argument has very little to do with truthfulness, otherwise he would've responded to Harris's claim.

So your mockery of Harris which was; ""pc-leftists dont dare to admit its true! Forbiddden knowledge!"" is partially true regarding ""le pc leftists"". Klein does believe this is some sort of ""Forbidden knowledge"". 

And I'm not trying to make Klein look like a fool. I think ""We shouldn't focus on race-science because it creates division"" is a good position to have. It's not a position I agree with, but it's a position worth defending IMO. My issue here is that how incorrect your reply was.",,/r/europe/comments/96o6h4/swedish_nazi_arrested_for_planned_murder_of/e43fqrk/,PooperPantoons,1534131463

These people are kind of shitty and they enjoy making other people suffer and feel bad, and they get emboldened from comments like yours, they see you making fun of certain countries and that makes them think it is okay. 

This is why some people called Trump out when he called some countries ""shitholes"". 

Why countries are at certain levels of developments is very complicated, and 99% of the people have nothing to do with it. Yet all this complexity doesn't stop idiots all over countries that aren't ""a mess"" from discriminating against people that they see as lesser just because they come from certain countries.

There are lots of people that think just because they were born in some country, that somehow makes them better and give them the right to abuse people from other countries. And your comments embolden them.

Maybe you've not been exposed to this certain type of abuse but I'm sure you've been made fun of or bullied at some point in your life and hope that you can relate.",Romania,/r/europe/comments/96rdox/romanian_gendarmes_trying_to_catch_a_woman/e439bim/,bobama123,1534124236

Also, take in mind - this poll ignores undecided voters (only decided ones are counted), and based on other polls, this group could by anywhere between 10 and 20%. And these are people who declare they plan to vote, they only don't know - for whom.

Generally - situation is stable (and SNAFU at the same time). If elections happened now, PiS would struggle with gaining individual majority, and will need a coalition partner. Only one (Kukiz) is even possible, and it wouldn't be an easy alliance. On the other hand, anti-PiS would also struggle to make a majority, and even if they do, it won't be an easy one (unless they decide for short-term ""emergency"" government, only to fix major crimes of PiS).

However, we are in a limbo, before two elections, and ~14 months of constant campaign. Lots will depend on result of local and EP elections, which could give energy to opposition. On the other hand, PiS will obviously make more electoral promises.

Anyway, if someone is interested in Polish polls, they are gathered [here](http://ewybory.eu/sondaze/). Generally IBRiS CATI ones (e.g. monthly regulars made for *Rzeczpospolita* daily) seem to be most reliable (they predicted both 2015 elections best), and CBOS (government owned, suspected of biased questions) and Pollster (CAWI only) least.

5141,"&gt;Very wishful thinking

The only wishful thinking was from the geniuses that though the first, the second, and now third bailout was going to work. It was the wishful thinking of geniuses that the GDP contraction would be limited in scope and period of time. It was the wishful thinking of geniuses that still claim the debt levels are sustainable.

&gt;You make inflation sound easier to control

Inflation is actually very easy to control. The question is if governments have the stomach to enact the policies to do so. I already mentioned this is a ""what-if"" scenario at this point. But yes, without anyone lending money to the Greek government they would have 2 options to choose from (or some combination of the two). 

1) Cut spending (fire government employees and reduce pensions)

2) Don't cut spending (in Drachmas) and keep printing money to cover obligations (and thus have high inflation)

So it would have been in the Greek government's hand (or the central bank) to control inflation. What control over inflation does Greece have today in the Eurozone? **Absolutely none**, which a contributing factor in this crisis. When Greece was overheating did the Eurozone increase rates? When Greece was in (and might still be) in a deflationary period did the Eurozone jump in with rate reductions and quantitative easing? If or when the ECB acted, it was due to market conditions in Germany, not Greece. Greece is currently still facing 20% unemployment and deflation or sub 1% inflation... and yet the ECB is ending QE.

So if your question is.. would the Greek government act rationally (with monetary policy), I don't have an answer. But it beats not having an option as is the case with the Eurozone.",,/r/europe/comments/96gzxc/greek_tragedy_the_collapse_in_its_economy_is/e4316sq/,GeorgePapadopoulos,1534115339

5159,"&gt; Irish exports to Britain have fallen 8pc to €5.5bn in the first five months of this year.

&gt; As Brexit looms, and sterling continues to fluctuate, and with British Prime Minister Theresa May trying to push through her latest plans, trade with our nearest neighbour already appears to have been negatively impacted.

&gt; It came as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned yesterday that escalating and sustained trade conflicts are increasingly likely, threatening to derail a global economic recovery and depress medium-term growth prospects.

&gt; The IMF, in an update to its World Economic Outlook growth forecasts, said that the United States, as the focus of retaliatory tariffs from trading partners, was especially vulnerable to a slowdown in its exports.

&gt; Yesterday, figures from the Central Statistics Office showed the value of Irish goods exports to Britain fell 8pc - or €508m - for the period January to May 2018 compared to the first five months of 2017.

&gt; Goods exports to the UK totalled €5.5m in the period.

&gt; Goods imports from the UK for the five months to May 2018 were €7.3bn, a 3pc increase on the same period in 2017.

&gt; Merrion Capital chief economist Alan McQuaid said lack of clarity over Brexit suggests risks on the external trade front remain elevated going forward, especially for food exporters. ""The pound has been volatile in recent months, and remains a lot higher than desirable for Irish exporters,"" said Mr McQuaid.

&gt; ""Positive vibes coming out of the UK and Brussels as regards the Brexit negotiations will be required if the pound is to regain lost ground.""

&gt; Overall, Ireland's trade surplus increased by 20pc to €5.2bn in May, the second-highest on record but monthly data can be volatile.

&gt; One month before the United States' tariffs on European steel and aluminium kick in, Irish exports to the US increased by 7.4pc to €16.2bn in the five months to May 2018, compared with the same period in 2017.

&gt; However, there was a big drop in imports from the US to Ireland, which fell by almost a fifth to €5.7bn in the five-month period.

&gt; The euro area recorded a €16.5bn surplus in trade in goods with the rest of the world in May this year, compared with €19.3bn in May last year.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/96t9t9/irish_exports_to_uk_fall_8pc_as_imf_warns_of/e431mqz/,Petemcfuzzbuzz,1534115808

5218,"&gt; Wikipedia has sources at the bottom.

Yes, which is for this case specifically, pretty much a Guardian article that actually talks about how the US intelligence helped right wing terror aka fascist terrorists in Italy.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/mar/26/terrorism

Let me help you with the very source you're trying to stick with for claiming US and the CIA did nothing there, and the attacks weren't related to the the US at all. 

&gt; US intelligence services instigated and abetted rightwing terrorism in Italy during the 1970s, a former Italian secret service general has claimed.

&gt; The allegation was made by General Gianadelio Maletti, a former head of military counter-intelligence, at the trial last week of rightwing extremists accused of killing 16 people in the bombing of a Milan bank in 1969 - the first time such a charge has been made in a court of law by a senior Italian intelligence figure.

&gt; Gen Maletti, comannder of the counter-intelligence section of the military intelligence service from 1971 to 1975, said his men had discovered that a rightwing terrorist cell in the Venice region had been supplied with military explosives from Germany.

&gt; Those explosives may have been obtained with the help of members of the US intelligence community, an indication that the Americans had gone beyond the infiltration and monitoring of extremist groups to instigating acts of violence, he said.

&gt; ""The CIA [Central Intelligence Agency], following the directives of its government, wanted to create an Italian nationalism capable of halting what it saw as a slide to the left and, for this purpose, it may have made use of rightwing terrorism,"" Gen Maletti told the Milan court. ""I believe this is what happened in other countries as well.""

I'm not sure how one can use a source that says the exact opposite what he claims. Sure, CIA helped a lot, but to the fascists. I'm sure they also helped a lot to the related Italian institutions related to the Gladio webs, in order to make them more efficient in backing the fascist gangs.

5226,"&gt;Sophistry. Sexual contact is intimate, immediate, direct. Contact with a building that might at some point have been worked on by someone who was underpaid is transitory, non-intimate, indirect.

So what? Does that in any way diminish the exploitation? I can cherrypick a few aspects too where construction work is more taxing.

You are completely happy to ignore the plight of construction workers because their exploitation happens out of your sight, even though you claim that's the reason to oppose legal prostitution. That is hypocritical. If you cared about exploitation, then you would propose the same measures in both cases.

If you think you have a good reason to restrict the freedom of choice of people when it comes to their sexuality, please argue the point. But stop hiding behind an insincere concern for exploitation. 

&gt;Making this analogy suggests you don’t understand the difference between direct physical human contact and walking down a road.

It doesn't mean I agree with you, I just don't care if you think we're the devil.

I understand that we'll never be able to see RS and VRS in the same light, and that's okay.

&gt; But only RS was transferred massive quantities of arms from what was left of Yugoslavia (Serbia)

When did that happen, and what arms were those? 

&gt;before the meme of a civil war was spouted and an arms embargo was in place. 

It is a textbook definition of a civil war. It was literally neighbor or neighbor action. 

&gt;Basically giving a green light for all muslims to be cleansed from Bosnia, which ya'll somehow failed to do.

Maybe that wasn't actually the point of the war?

&gt;That's a choice for each individual, still draws no comparison.

And when many individuals choose the same thing, it says something. 

&gt;They had homes before the war.. 

And we made sure that they had homes after as well. 

&gt;There was no Croat-Bosniak force materializing to attack Serbs. It took ethnic cleansings around Bijeljina and beyond to even motivate anyone to make a government army.

Hmm, lasting relationship wherein people want to end it but can't because getting a divorce is legally too complicated and costly—sounds extremely appealing.

&gt; If you quit at the first sign of serious trouble, what kind of marriage is that? What kind of relationship is that?

&gt; Yet if you power through, if you find compromises that work, you can look back on bad times and know you have the strength to fight through future challenges.

Yeah and you can do that all on your own without artificial legal complications. You're basically saying ""You should enter into a legal structure that forces you to do this because you know of yourself that you don't have the clarity of mind to make those decisions without the law forcing you.""

Guess what people who are so not in control of their own emotions that they need to sign a legal contract that forces them to do those things don't make for stable lasting relationships to begin with. If you _need_ marriage to not make dumb decisions you are so flippant in the heat of the moment that you shouldn't be married to begin with.

You're moving the goalposts. 

You said *multiculturalism nowadays is not talking about different types of European ethnicities* and *Not much bias training against Eastern Europeans going around in the UK*, and I proivded a link with a Eastern European women suffering racist abuses on live fucking TV, which pretty much shows anyone with half a brain that ""aversion to multiculturalism"" very much extends to Eastern Europeans.

Furthermore, I would advise you to read up on Hitler's ""Mein Kampf"", and on the general racial hierarchical theories of the 19th century on which his opinions are derived from and which are still accepted as fact by the far-right to this day, and figure out just where Eastern and Southern Europeans stand in the pecking order.

As for your little movement of the goal post, I fail to see how the British Authorities and Institutions not being shown fighting against hate speech on camera changes the fact that for many British racists, Poles are not welcome and should go home, despite the fact that they're white.

Their motto is *Britain for the British*, not *Britain for the White*.

&gt; Come on mate, we are grouped as ""white"" hence we have privilege.

If you say so... I know for a fact that most racists would place tons of asterisks on that statement.

As I said, it's not genetic but an aspect of culture and that cultures stance on education. I got a scholarship to an American university and my African American peers said that in the poorer black neighborhoods, if you focused on your studies, you were routinely picked on and attacked. Same problem as with gypsies in Europe. I don't think black people are any lesser then their white counterparts in their ability to learn or accomplish anything, but it's the communities and poverty that brings the black counterparts down. While some aspect of intelligence is genetic, it is very minuscule and your upbringing as more of an affect on how you turn out. A black and white baby coming out are pretty much equal, it's what happens after that affects their outcome.

&gt;actually the battle of Lepanto pretty much crushed Ottoman Mediterranean ambitions.

It didn´t. They just stoped focusing on the entire mediterranean and only focused on the East-Mediterranean. That´s it. The fleet was built even bigger in just a few years. 

&gt;The first siege of Vienna halted Ottoman expansion in Europe

It didn´t. Süleyman fought over Hungary. The only reason why Vienna was invaded, was because the claimer of Hungary flet to there. At that time Frankfurt was seat of the emperor anyways. When the Persians attacked from the east, the siege was lifted. The Ottomans didn´t even have causalities worth to mention and completly achieved their aims in Hungary. 

&gt;From there on they were never really that much of a threat.

They were until the second siege of vienna. That´s 1683 for you and almost all of Europe was needed to get a piece of land from the Ottomans. They kept being a huge monster until the late 18th century and even after that, they kept being a considerable enemy.

&gt;The Spanish Empire was the richest

And went bankrupt multiple times. It couldn´t even keep its colonies, but simple crumbled. 

&gt;The Ottoman Empire, on the other hand, had well connected territories, which allowed rulers like Suleiman to pool their resources way more efficiently.

5506,"You keep repeating ""mom and pop shop"" like it's some kind of value proposition. 

My point is clear: The big belgian and NL ports don't need subventions to handle the increased trade from Ireland. They may not even notice it.

On the other hand, no amount of subsidies will make the trip from Cork or Dublin to Rotterdam shorter. It is about two days. French ports, on the other hand, can ship to Ireland in under one day. Subsidies could help these infrastructures provide a commercially viable service, because it is different from what competitors have to offer. It is not very surprising, in that context, that France criticizes the current deal.

I know that you're just telling your experience as it is but I think it's important to know that SH is very different compared to people like Peterson, Shapiro, etc.

The man meditated for a decade, got a bachelor's in philosophy and a PhD in neuroscience and is now trying to teach non-supernatural spiritualism (for those who don't know; he's a radical atheist who is famous for his views on free will, etc). He's relatively left-wing on most issues and is a very vocal critic of Trump.

His (minor) alt-right following is because; he is afraid of Jihadism's affects on the west (he actively supports muslim reformers), he's vocal against American PC bullcrap, and most importantly he defended Charles Murray, the author of The Bell Curve. This last one may seem off putting, but according to Harris and also the editor-in-chief of the journal Intelligence, the things said in the book are already established facts in neurology and other intelligence-related sciences. Besides Harris has made clear that he does not support making laws based on IQ and whatnot.

The problem is that east of Cyprus the world doesn't end. Europeans have a fantasy that they are not connected to us(middle east) or that they are far away from the middle east(my flight from Israel to Cyprus is shorter than from Greece to Cyprus as an example). 

In reality, Europe is simple to close to the middle east geographically as a result of that Middle Eastern and European history and politics are closely connected with one another thousands of years and will continue be so. Face it Europe lives in a bad neighborhood and it can't really leave it.

Your choosing Cyprus is ironic. I assume you consider Cyprus too be the most east  European or Western country before the middle east(common belief at least at r/europe).

Well Eastern Germany is not included, because the division is not made on regional bases, but on country-bases. And Eastern Germany is not a country anymore. I agree though that especially Saxony from the Czech perspective is probably very close to us mentally/socially.

Austria is sometimes included and sometimes not. This is because Austria has historically had such close relations with our countries (Czechia, Slovakia, Hungary) through the A-H empire that the ties have not been broken despite 40 years of communism. From the Czech perspective, Austria just feels so familiar, specially the eastern and central part. The architecture, the landscape, the food, the culture, everything is just so similar that it's impossible for me to not feel close to them. It's also a country of a similar size which again instictively creates a sense of familiarity. Another thing to consider is the modern politics. In the recent years, Austrian political and social climate in relation to the immigration crisis started to resemble the climate in my country somewhat. Our government is increasingly allied on this question with the Austrian government.

All in all the economic ties between Finland and Russia are rather small ... the stereotype of Russia being an important partner comes from the 70s and it is for the best that Russia isn't an important partner any more as this way they don't have trade power over Finland.


As for the NATO being needed or not ... 70% of Finnish generals support Finland supporting NATO. They should know something about the security situation.

5783,"&gt;In 2016, during an official visit by a Russian delegation to Banja Luka, talks focused on establishing a partnership between Republika Srpska and Russian police on matters including intelligence collection, counterterrorism, and combatting cybercrime. Republika Srpska also agreed to host Russian police trainers and to send members of Serb special units to Moscow for training. Since then, Russian intelligence officers (former members of the Federal Security Service) often give lectures and teach courses in the Republika Srpska police academy and at the University of Banja Luka’s faculty of security studies, which serves as the regional police’s policy planning department.

&gt;Meanwhile, under the pretext of counterterrorism, Republika Srpska has recently been strengthening its police force in ways that resemble outright militarization, sometimes with the help of Russia. For example, the RS Ministry of Internal Affairs bought 2,500 long-barreled weapons this year from a Zastava Arms, a Serbian manufacturer in Kragujevac. According to Reuf Bajrovic, Bosnia’s former economy minister, that’s 10 times as many high-powered rifles ordered by the national police forces in Sarajevo. The Republika Srpska authorities are also opening a new $4 million dollar training center at the site of a former army barracks in Zaluzani, outside Banja Luka. Russia has already committed to provide Serb forces with anti-terrorism training at the center,which will serve as the headquarters for new anti-terrorist units, logistics units, and a department to combat organized crime.

The German military is an ineffective disgrace and most Germans are against helping other countries in the event of an attack anyway, and the US is currently not a great partner.

I understand they weren't communist by your definition, but that's not relevant, nobody blames theoretical communism, but the totalitarian regimes that were installed in its name. Estonia is basically a city state with half the population of Bucharest, such small societies are relatively easy to change.

If you take out the spoon, the water keeps spinning for a while because of the momentum.

The other is the air temperature: the difference in the air temperature between high altitude and low altitude is what creates “a hole” in the mass of air pushing it upwards.

5867,"&gt;Instability due to, again... francoists

Yes, precisely mi point, the controlled sizely portions of the army and might have attempted a coup had the republic been proposed. 

&gt;Keep in mind that during those same years there were already 2 referendums to transition to democracy:

&gt;Spanish political reform referendum (1976)

&gt;Spanish constitutional referendum (1978)

&gt;That of the republic would simply have been one more; the third. And I don't think there would have been a serious problem, no more than these other referendums could have been.

But there is a crucial difference between these two and a referendum on the republic. The monarchy was the guarantee that, no matter what happened regarding the democracy and so on, Spain would not go crazy. It was the guarantee to a group of officers who had been at war with a republic controlled by the Communists (in a war they saw as a crusade to save Spain) that Communism would not return to power and Spain would not be split. 

Carrillo knew this, and that's is why I think him and the Communist Party accepted the monarchy, even if they have campaigned against it ever since. He knew that a certain assurance had to be given to the conservative and francoists that things would not go too crazy when the government legalized the Communists and granted unprecendented autonomy to the regions. 

I recognize that I can not look into Suárez mind to knoe what he was thinking... but I do think this is more or less what happened...","Spain, USE ",/r/europe/comments/95wyqn/preference_between_monarchy_and_republic_in_spain/e41w2de/,NombreGracioso,1534065221

5870,"&gt;So - how many Poles were arrested, imprisoned and executed by soviets according to you in this single action? What numbers are more reliable in your opinion than numbers from Memorial?

There is a primary source, the archives. Normally there is no ethnic data breakdown in the archives.

There is a secondary source, the memo.ru series of articles. They do the breakdown by unknown extrapolation, it is not explained in detail.

In a report to Khrushchev as part of his labour in destroying the cult of personality of Stalin there is a number of 877 000 people^1 that were executed during Stalin tyranny (1921-1954).

Of those 877 000 executed are considered convicted for crimes against the State 642 980 people in the same report.  

Obviously it wasn't distributed evenly and there were periods of greater persecutions: after the Civil War, during Great Purge of 1937-1938 and after World War II. Historians estimate that during 1937-1938 happened the most part estimates of historians giving 80-85% of all the convictions to the maximum penalty.

Telling that out of more than 500 000 executed during Great Purge over 20% were done for based on their ethnicity is a very serious accusation. Because the Great Purge trials are criticized for the lack of due process. However the statement coming from the wikipedia page turns it in an ethnic cleansing, or even more so an act of genocide. 

For such strong accusation they should in the least give the exact methods of how they arrived to those conclusions, source primary documents from the archives, etc. Nothing of this kind was done. There is just misquoted narrative from memo.ru

^1 There are are different estimated made by historians (less or more), I quote this number because it comes from primary source ""Rudenko report to Khrushchev"".

Changing topic a bit, let's talk about memorial series of articles on the subject, since it is the source everyone quotes.

[«Польская операция» НКВД 1937–1938 гг.](http://old.memo.ru/history/POLAcy/00485ART.htm) by Petrov and Roginsky

&gt;Процент расстрелянных по «польскому» приказу выше этой средней цифры: по нему были рассмотрены дела на 143 810 человек, из которых осуждено 139 835, в том числе приговорено к расстрелу 111 091 человек, что составляет 77,25% от числа рассмотренных дел и 79,44% от числа осужденных.

It says that by the mentioned order were executed 111 091 people. It doesn't provide the method or source how they extrapolated 111 091 people from the rest of the executed during Great Purge.

Then at one moment they are being honest:

&gt;Только 16 мая 1938 г. НКВД СССР приказал местным органам включать в свои отчеты данные о национальном составе арестованных. Лишь с этого момента можно с основанием говорить о специальном интересе руководства НКВД к этническому аспекту репрессий.

Only May 16, 1938 NKVD ordered to include the ethnic data of the arrested. Only after this date we can speak about NKVD interest in ethnic aspect of the Purge.

&gt;Всего Особые тройки по всем национальным операциям осудили за эти два месяца 105 032 человека. Поляков по национальности (то есть тех, кому согласно паспорту, или иному документу, или на основании устного заявления, или по воле следователя — немало известно и таких случаев — записывали в следственное дело, что он — поляк) среди них было больше всего — 21 258 (затем следовали немцы — 17 150, русские — 15 684, украинцы — 8773, белорусы — 5716...).

In those 2 months special tribunals for *national operations* convicted (doesn't say to death) 105 032 people. Poles by ethnic origin (by passport or other statement) were the most - 21 258 (then Germans - 17150, Russians - 15684, Ukrainians - 8773, Belarusians - 5716...).

So in conclusion for the article - there are numbers present, there is narrative present. There is no source for the numbers present. And I remind you that any person can extracted certified copy from the archives, they don't take copies neither do they source the archive reference numbers for the documents they used.

Now regarding professional honesty of the authors. I know nothing about Roginsky. Petrov however is the origin of the meme ""Billions executed personally by Stalin"" in Russian Internet and cannot by any means by qualified as serious investigator, his articles and interviews are always some mixture of qualifying statements and narrative instead of dry expression of facts and sources.

In conclusion: the original source for all the articles regarding the topic - is a short article done by Roginsky and Petrov for memo.ru. It doesn't provide links to primary sources other than orders which can be used for article in only a perverse conspiracy-theory kind of interpretation, it doesn't explain their methods. And memo.ru is NGO created to 'expose Soviet terrorist-totalitarian regime crimes', nobody in sane mind can expect unbiased opinion from them.",:illuminati: Bunker :illuminati:,/r/europe/comments/96fyd8/81_years_ago_the_head_of_the_nkvd_nikolai_yezhov/e41w37u/,IvanMedved,1534065272

PSD also had power during 2012-2015, but that time they had to work with our former president, Basescu. He was a political beast that used some questionable tactics to keep them in line, especially regarding the justice system. So they were still corrupt, but tame compared with now. After a scandal in 2015, they withdrew from power and we had a technocratic government until 2016. It was good, but people took it for granted. Another thing, during the 2016 campaign, the campaign strategist of the biggest opposition party was himself investigated for corruption, so they had a very poorly presented offer. What is now the most active opposition party was just being formed. 

So the opposition was in shambles, people were apathetic and didn't expect PSD to return to their 90s habits, and PSD made unrivaled promises to greatly rise wages and start a lot of infrastructure projects. This led to a low presence, and their hardcore voters were a relative majority.

Welcome to r/europe, you must be new. 

&gt;The IT guy has information from a field he might not be familiar with. That information could prove valuable for his career and is based on a gathering of information and evidence that could be replicated in an experiment over and over. Not a valid comparison.

So the perspectives of women and minorities is not something the old, White men could possibly be unfamiliar with, and in need of guidance learning about? 

&gt;We don't know what valid training these junior professors have in untraining ""implicit biases"" so we do not know whether their position is earned or not. It seems these junior professors have their own implicit biases since they are so selective in who should be ""taught"" by them. On top of that, we do not even know how to recognize implicit biases in people. I am going to borrow info from another person's post

We don't know anything about these technical details. Just the usual scaremongering from the Torygraph painting an image of respected people being sent to stand in the corner by obese, pink-haired activists. 

I'd trust that the experts (apparently a professor himself) overseeing this project would be well-suited to ensure standards will be kept high. 

&gt;Government is making people pay taxes towards programs that aren't even honest in their findings and effectiveness. This is all just a waste unless they find more credible evidence that is reproducible.

So because there is scientific debate among specialists, you get to swoop in and declare that the critics are fully in the right, and all this is bogus? Effectively saying prejudice and stereotypes are not things we all live with? Cool.

5913,"That's an incredibly simplistic view. Homosexuality may have been decriminalized relatively early, but discrimination in society was rife. You would have been certain to lose your job if your sexuality became public knowledge or you were photographed in lgbt get-togethers. Considering all companies were state-run enterprises, whose upper echelons would necessarily be members of the Party, they absolutely thought negatively about it.

Homosexuality was primarily decriminalized due to Czechoslovakia's incredibly developed position in Sexuology in the 1920s, 1930s, 1940s and 1950s. Sexuologists at the time were well respected, got government funding for their research and were consulted as experts on legal issues concerning sex and family life. Their work led to the early liberation and legal equality of women versus men (being able to individually decide on working, opening bank accounts, etc. without having to have permission from their husbands or fathers) when such legal equality would only come much later for other countries, both in the West and East (Federal Germany only enacted such equality legislation in the 70s) as well as the right to an abortion in 1957, which was also remarkably early compared to other countries in the world. From this also came research into the female orgasm, recommendation and support for pre-marital sex as important for seccessful monogamous relationships, equal child care, and the mentioned legalization of homosexuality. However, political ideology reversed against these progressive ideas in the late 60's with the Invasion of the Warsaw Pact in response to the Prague Spring (an attempt at social, economic and political liberalization and reform) and the subsequent period of Normalization. All the above was thanks to the separation of Sexologists from the Communist party, a fact no longer true after 1968.

To this day, KSCM (Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia), the legal successor to the KSC (Czechoslovak Communist Party), is composed of party members and leadership who are expressly against the idea of equal marriage, or adoption rights, including step-child adoption, which again puts those families at risk and into discrimination as there are no legal protections for them in case their parter dies. They label homosexuals and the fight for the equality they seek as embarrassing humbug, tasteless over made-up transsexuals, trying to ""cheat"" the already ""tolerant"" Czech society into forcibly respecting their depravity. [Just ask Josef Skála, the vice-chair of the Party how he views homosexuals and Prague Pride.](https://www.kscm.cz/cs/aktualne/aktuality/otazka-parlamentnich-listu-pro-josefa-skalu-3) Notice that link is to the Party's official website, so nothing has been out of context.",Also maybe Czechoslovakia,/r/europe/comments/96hf1g/prague_pride_biggest_lgbt_event_in_any_former/e41s2d6/,mastovacek,1534057264
