30,"I think both countries need electoral reform, but regarding the US I think it needs to be regarding the electoral college. I think it is time each vote counts individually for the presidential race, but I also think the way the houses work is a good model because as someone said, even though there are 2 senators per state regardless of size, in the house of representatives that is evened out as it is based on population.


As for the UK, I'm 100% with you. As much as I despise UKIP/BXP, it's time to have PR in place so that each vote counts. It's true they would get more representation,  but so would parties like the greens and lib dems,  and thus it would lead to more discussion and compromises, and by extension hopefully less extreme policies actually getting through. The lord's need reform as well, specially the selection process. It's inherently broken when the sitting government gets to make the appointments. I personally think a system like the Senate's would be ideal. A set and equal number of people per 'region' in the UK (based on a breakdown like the one in this map https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/BLANK_in_England.svg/1280px-BLANK_in_England.svg.png , with Wales and northern Ireland being their own region, and having two regions for Scotland as well given its size) so that while the commons can represent areas based on population (which again, I think it makes sense) the lord's would ensure each region at least has a valid say on policy,  hopefully meaning the usual criticism of a lot of policy being south centric being somewhat countered. Government would still be picked from the commons as it would be the bigger house, with no term limit on those elected there and with the current five year or less limit per term, with the lord's being a maximum of 50 people or so (3 or 4 per region) on longer fixed terms (maybe 8 years a term, being able to serve a maximum of two?) that cannot have early elections either unless there are individual exceptional circumstances where someone has to resign or passes away, with a by election happening just for that seat so a new person can take on the role for the remainder of the term only ( their term count depending if they got elected before or after the midway point of the 8 years). Hopefully these longer terms would mean these representatives would be less concerned with reelection, specially if they have a 2 term limit as well, and thus would work towards the best interest of the country in mind instead of their pockets.",,/r/europe/comments/c68dcr/united_states_president_on_vestager_eu/es8cnvn/,Kurutta,1561693618

Yeah, I know, the Flemish consider Brussels Flemish, but it really isn't. Not anymore. It's European. And the European Institutions are a big reason for having all that money.

Then, yeah, right now Flanders is richer, so it kinda supports the Walloon region. On the other hand, the opposite was true when the mines around Charleroi were productive. AFAIK working in the mines was one of the reasons why there was a wave of Italian immigrants to Belgium.

So by making those claims, you're oversimplifying things yourself.

Russia is static; it does not innovate, it does not invest, it does not develop. It just... is. It does not contribute to anything, because that means change and change cannot be tolerated in a dictatorship. That is the biggest advantage of liberal societies over authoritarian regimes, in my opinion: The former changes constaly, everything is in flow, theyadapt, change, fail, change again, fail again, change again, succeed, change some more.  
The latter can’t allow that to happen because its’ fate is invariably bound to its leader. The leader doesn’t want to change, therefore the country can’t. Change is dangerous.

Are you kidding me? Is that how you construct an argument?

What if Fukushima and Chernobyl *still* are on everybody's mind? Are you going to say:

Not only the electorate is wrong, the economists are wrong, but also the fucking expert advice to the most pro-nuclear party in Germany, advising someone with a scientific background is all bound to be biased headless chickens? WTF? Where does this come from?

I recommend taking a closer look at the respective government documents, and then build me a case where they can be of-so-scared and still keep running them to this day at approx 50% of what it was at the time of Fukushima (and the [majority of reduction falls into the time before](https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/29295/umfrage/anteil-der-atomenergie-an-der-stromerzeugung-in-deutschland/), when to pro nuclear party ran things).

There’s no doubt that it’s a backward tradition. Nobody in their right mind can say being covered head to toe in the sun on a hot summer day is playing it smart (unless they have issues with the sun and their skin). Besides the whole idea of woman having to cover up in Islam is insulting to both genders. To men, because it’s assumed we are apes that run around raping and to women because they are too frail and tempting to us male apes. That whole rationale is fundamentally at odds with the modern Western tradition. Hence my belief it’s culturally backward.

With everything going around I'd thought theyc would have stayed high (especially arrests) or even increased... Or maybe all tactics changed so all separatists' acrtion reached the ffc stage.

I think right-wing numbers could change rapidly, and that a stark difference will already be seen in the 2018/2019 stats. I do believe most of ther violent actions were lone types spur of the moment things, but there was always the network behind it and I think that now they are starting to try and use the network for more violent means, instead of being content with simple propaganda and recruiting.

Now as the heat continues to increase, especially if this is in a deep-seeded pile where the manure in the center of the pile doesn't have the ability to cool down by being exposed to cooler air on the surface, it will continue heating up until it hits what's called 'ignition temperature.'

379,"\&gt; Both the Focus and Fiesta are by far the most dynamic car in their respective segments.  

In what way? Their drivetrain is terrible - engines are nothing special in in itself and their automatic transmission options are either ""none"" or ""you'd rather not"". Actually that's another part of the equation: 10 years ago in pretty much all European markets manual outsold automatic heavily. Nowadays most European markets actually have more automatic sales then manuals.

Drive? Honestly, again nothing special at all. What's absolutely shocking to me is you don't even get independent rear suspension unless you go for top engine options. Without it Focus is just aweful, with it... nice. There's no long the same gulf between it and other cars in its class that made me buy 1st gen Focus all those years ago. Yeah, sure it might be ""best in class"" but 2nd best in class is just 0.1% worse while also giving much better engine/transmission, better quality interior, better tech and all that for same price.

And since you actually mention 1 Series... Since the current generation is finishing production you could have gotten insane deals on those in last couple months.

Fiesta on the other hand is straight up bad. Yes, it's really 'sharp' but it's also really sharp in your spine (ST3 variant at least, wasn't in the market for normal ones at all). People who actually want this kind of car also don't have money to buy this kind of car. And tell me again, why would I buy Fiesta when I can get Mini Cooper S for only slightly more, that's as much fun while not destroying your spine in process (also one that I can actually get with automatic gearbox with pedal shifters if I want to)? And before you say ""buy Cooper S is MUCH more"" - go to your dealership and ask, the difference between sticker prices for those is massive... which leads me to:

\&gt; This is totally country dependent.

Sure it is. But the fact you can genuinely get better deal on a Mini/BMW or Mercedes then a fucking Ford anywhere in a world should be a hint why the brand might not be doing that well. Yes, it's top-of-the-line spec vs what for premium brand might be close to baseline version but still.

If your brand is significantly weaker then others, your quality isn't better and you charge same price, what exactly do you expect? VW worked hard on their ""nearly premium"" brand in Europe, Ford didn't.

Plus as I said... Even though Fiesta and Focus are competitive in their own niches, what about others? What Ford has to offer to counter Qashqai or Tiguan? Nothing is an answer.

397,"&gt; If they really cared about the economy of NI then they wouldn't be insisting on a backstop that creates a barrier between NI and its largest market in favour of access to one with less significance.

They are insisiting on a backstop to not get in trouble with the rest of the World. If the UK and the EU don't enforce their trade regimes, which requires a border, they will both operate in violation of WTO rules and other countries will be happy to exploit that to advance their positions relative to the UK and the EU. After everything we have seen from the Brexiteers in this entire process it might be just their usual behaviour to break a few more rules and wash away all risk with their believe in British exceptionalism, but the EU cannot operate on that level.

Besides, what's the point of ""taking back control"" if you don't enforce that control through border? The Brexiteers want to tackle and reduce immigration, but they leave their only land border open so that everyone can enter without controls? What is their next brilliant plan once they realise that these pesky immigrants are still arriving though the 500 kilometers of Irish border? Say good bye to all standards and treaties on human rights and asylum to make short work of new arrivals?

Ah, so instead of being mislead about the dangerosity of nuclear, they have been misled about the dangerosity of nuclear waste.

The dangerous stuff is the High-Activity, Long-Life waste. The rest is pretty much harmless or should decay in a relatively short time, therefore is not as concerning.

France produces and has produced 80%-75% of it's electricity via Nuclear Reactors for nearly 50 years. How much LL-HA waste do you think that represents ?

The volume of the Long-Life High-Activity waste is less than one football field times 80cm. (100x50x0.8)

**Furthermore**, this waste can still be reused to produce more energy later, in molten salts reactors which were experimentally proven to work.

Therefore, this argument is invalid. We only need to store the LL-HA waste until we decide to use it, and the volume that we have to store is ridiculously small anyways.",,/r/europe/comments/c61ld3/lowcarbon_electricity_share_in_eu_was_538_in_2018/es749rn/,amicaze,1561663558

Now with neural networks, we're facing the automation of mental and creative jobs. An AI can learn how to diagnose diseases far quicker than it takes to train a human to do so. And will be better at it.

But the real kicker is that any new jobs that arise after the old ones are automated? Practically instantly, AI's can and will learn to do those as well. There's really no kind of job that is safe from automation anymore.

In a way, now it's kinda etched in my personality. Maybe I will never live in Russia but I am fairly sure that the rest of my life will definitely involve communication with Russians or Russian language. 

Though I totally see your point. Being from Turkey and studying hard for a better life only to end up in Russia... Sounds like a downgrade in some aspects. I will be honest: if I had to choose between SPb and Berlin, I'd go for the latter. Yet I don't wanna die before spending at least a year living in Russia, which might be the most wonderful experience ever and then become a permanent move - my days in Ukraine were probably among the best ever in my life so I will always adore Slavland one way or another.

Dear journalist: You're writing an article, not a book. Use fewer words !

&gt; First, do not split the difference with populists. Instead, take on their arguments with emotionally resonant facts.  are powerful argumentative props

First, why is there even a split ? I'm a nationalist and I'm ok with renewable energy. In fact, I believe everyone likes clean air, noiseless electric cars, and not being dependent on backwards religious regimes from the Middle Ages. So the question is not so much about renewable energy vs. oil but about who should carry the inevitable and probably large costs ? The rich or the poor ?

Second, who's emotional ? The climate-warriers are dragging a 14 year old girl around the World, why ? Because she has some insigths a gazillion of adult researchers/politicians/journalists/analytics completely missed ? Or because it resonate emotionally ? Pro-tip: It makes people like me puke and completely shut it out

&gt; Second, do not pander to those who resist change, but do not patronise them either

People are not against change. They're against changes to the worse for themselves ! But all I hear from the climate-warriors are proposals that would make life a lot harder for the lower ranks of society; of course people are against them !",,/r/europe/comments/c677fs/environmentalism_is_emerging_as_europes_new/es6tpxx/,clrsm,1561657114

Counterpoint: Muslims in the US.

&gt; Overall, eight-in-ten Muslims (82%) say they are either very concerned (66%) or somewhat concerned (16%) about extremism in the name of Islam around the world. This is similar to the percentage of the U.S. general public that shares these concerns (83%)


&gt; When asked whether targeting and killing civilians can be justified to further a political, social or religious cause, 84% of U.S. Muslims say such tactics can rarely (8%) or never (76%) be justified, while 12% say such violence can sometimes (7%) or often (5%) be justified.

&gt; Compared with the U.S. public as a whole, Muslims are more likely to say targeting and killing civilians for political, social or religious reasons is never justifiable (76% vs. 59%). Roughly equal shares of Muslims (5%) and Americans as a whole (3%) say such tactics are often justified (the difference between these numbers is not statistically significant)

689,"This is a ""how do I get from here to 10 miles down the road"" issue.... the answer is you make the first stem and then the next one and then the one after that. Long term we need to get off gas, but right hear and now, we need to get off coal (which is exactly what we are doing)

We also need to keep the lights on as we do it. 

Sure - we don't currently have a economic storage solution. We will need that to go to 100% renewables, but what we need to do THIS YEAR is to keep building solar and wind as fast as we can. The existing grid cna handle it and it's BETTER THAN WHAT WE HAVE NOW. By the time we are hitting 50% renewables it will be an issue. I'm hopeful that by then one of the many different approaches to storage will be coming onstream.

We cant build a new grid - we have to adapt our current one keeping it running as we do that. Thankfully it doesn't really matter much what you or I think - the overall market is actually doing exactly what I describe. For years, coal has been reducing and gas increasing. in the last two years gas has actually decreased slightly as renewables finally have hit serious levels of production -

Theres a nice representation of the year by year change if you look back through these charts.

691,"500+ are not bribes. The literal one time payment of 1100 to the group of people who have the highest chance of giving them a victory 2 weeks before the vote is a bribe. I don't know how else you would call it, it's also not a common practice, unless you're trying to boost your economy temporarily, but then you don't give it to the fucking retirees. If you want to temporarily boost the income of companies, by increasing the amount of spending done you would probably give it to the students, not the old people.

Also I would really like you to tell me how they failed the tax collection, maybe you want to talk about the VAT gap, or the commission which PiS created? If so, please tell me first, how can PiS form a commission to find out why the reverse VAT wasn't introduced sooner, if PiS was the biggest opponent of reverse VAT when PO was in power?

And nobody cares if the opposition calls public media irrelevant, any independent source will show that the public media has become completely dependent on the current government. And even if the other newspapers were as you claimed (even though they aren't dependent on the opposition, they are free to write what they want), but if they were, you would be okay with PiS actually taking away your democracy?

700,"&gt;Im not necessarily for building new nuclear power plants but to switch of the old ones was a bad choice.

You propably assume, that if we hadn't switched that rapidly off nuclear we would still have build the same amount of renewables and would have less coal.
But is an assumption that is realistic? I think not. If yes, than we propably made the wrong choice.

&gt;Are you sure about the costs? Especially for solar it seems unbelievable.

I only have numbers for the US, because investments into nuclear power is basically dead in germany, so there is no sense in calculating anything in that regard.

&gt; Why do you think smaller, poorer countries use the dollar or euro without being in that fiscal union 

*sigh* They almost always don't. A very small number of countries use the dollar outright, they tend to be microstates or have very specific, unique economies and/or problems (e.g. Zimbabwe uses USD because their own currency became worthless). 

Nowhere uses the Euro outside of the Euro Area except for a handful of principalities and the overseas territories of EMU members. 

This is a negligible collection of countries. 

Now, there are some real economies which do peg their currency to the USD or EUR (mostly the former), but they (as with those using foreign currencies outright) generally have unusual economies and, this is very, very important, can adjust the peg as when they want, or abandon it altogether. This is a luxury that Euro Area member states don't have. 

The vast, vast majority of countries maintain their own currencies, whether they try to maintain fx stability or not is irrelevant, they have the freedom to control their own monetary policy.

735,"What i am saying is what we currently have (coal + Gas) is possibel to replace with renewables + gas.

The simple fact is we will have massive difficulty in replacing more than a couple percent of generation per year. We have been massively ramping up installations of wind and solar for years - but from a miniscule beginning. It is likely to continue at the current rate of installs - which we can actually deal with - adapting the current grid to incorporate (which requires extra controls and an upgraded grid in some cases).

There are two questions - first where do we want the grid to end up  eventually, the other is what do we need to do this year to make that next 1 or 2% change to the existing grid towards that eventual goal.

At least for the minute, the answer is we will be adding wind and solar and trying to decomission coal - probably the worst in terms of CO2.

yes, currency devalution is very fast and may in an ideal world be good for a short while. However, at least Italy has used this trick for a whole decade and beyond, back in the 80s.

All in all, I am glad the Euro took away this trick from our incompetent politicians. It will force them eventually to make serious long term plans to tackle the root causes of our crisis. For now they are still  thinking we can raise the GDP/Debt ratio to 200% or have a parallel currency :/

844,"&gt;Nuclear is absolutely not competing with wind or solar in any way.

Of course it is. They both have costs that are mostly concentrated in the building phase. So they both want to produce as much as possible, and sell everything they produce, because their capital is a sunk cost and they don't save money by not producing like gas plants. So if you have a grid with only nuclear and renewables, you'll have to shut down either in the case of overproduction. The one you pick will make less money due to that decision. But if there was gas or hydro on the grid, they would be the obvious candidate to shut down.

Both nuclear and renewables have supply/demand mismatches, so they both need supporting flexible capacity. They will compete for grid access and for the use of that capacity to step up when they can't supply to demand.",Limburg,/r/europe/comments/c61ld3/lowcarbon_electricity_share_in_eu_was_538_in_2018/es5yz8p/,silverionmox,1561634922

852,"Im a German and our politics regarding nuclear power is redicoulus. Merkel, who studied physics, actually claimed that fukushima changed her oppinion for the worse? That is so pathetic and no one called her out on that.

I'm not claiming nuclear power is great, but I was totally against it until I learned more about it. Now Im extremely annoyed by the way it is treated in Germany.

You are right that the main concern is nuclear waste. But then I remember how the green party stopped a science project that tried to invent nuclear reactors that produce power by turning nuclear waste into other nuclear waste with a half life of only some decades. Their reason was: A technology like that could make nuclear power more viable in the public opinion. Yeah, duh!

That is an example how our green party is extremely idiological, to a point of hurting their own agenda. My basic point of view is green, progressive and social, so I would be the perfect voter for the green party. But they are so narrow minded and anti science that I can't justify voting for them.

Another example is their war against genetically engineered plants. Yeah, it would be nice if everyone could buy organic food. The problem is we have 7 billion people to feed on earth. The amount of space one calorie needs on a organic field is about 10 times the amount of space one calorie of genetically engineered plants would need. So we could preserve actual nature around the world instead of farm fields when we use genetic engineering. Also genetically manipulated food can help with a lot of 3ed world problems, like better storability in bad conditions or building up resistance against deseases we don't have in Germany.

Im not claiming we shouldn't have any concern regarding genetic manipulation, but the complete rejection of that technology is insane and a disgusting standpoint for someone who has enough money to buy high quality organic food while people die of hunger in other regions of the world.",,/r/europe/comments/c61ld3/lowcarbon_electricity_share_in_eu_was_538_in_2018/es5z0y1/,BrunoBraunbart,1561634974

Ah, so that's why all parties in Sweden agree to adopt the Euro. This must also be the reason why the yearly held surveys also show a steadily growing support for the Euro. Because ""they want no part in it""



Sweden held a referendum in 2003, whether to adopt the Euro or not. 56% decided not to join. That was one year after the Euro was introduced and everything was still new and uncertain.

Todays swedish government is in support of joining the Euro throughout all parties, but they aren't doing a second referendum to respect the results of the one from 16 years ago. They want to wait longer before they hold a second one.

Here a quote by a local AfD group from August 2018 that puts that kind of quote into context:

&gt;„Bei uns bekannten Revolutionen wurden irgendwann die Funkhäuser sowie die Presseverlage gestürmt und die Mitarbeiter auf die Straße gezerrt“

&gt;""With the revolutions we know about, at some point the radio stations and the press publishers were stormed and the employees were dragged into the street"".

Their very first actions, days after they were officially founded, consisted of calling themselves a ""citizens militia"" and trying to control passports of people they deemed un-German.

On October 1st they were arrested, most of them previously known and/or previously arrested.

The attitudes and approaches of eurocrats like her haven't succeeded in bringing the UK to heel, rather it has produced a deadlocked UK parliament propped up by a government unwilling to call a general election and bring in a new parliament that is actually representative of the people. What EU heavy-handedness has actually done is push us brink of the worst outcome for the EU. 

&gt;“It’s certainly a pity for the British that they didn’t have someone at this level on their side,” he added. “She had a concept of what had to be done and what had to be avoided, and she applied that concept in an extremely permanent and rigorous way, whereas the British changed directions every three months.”

This supports the idea that the UK has consistently tried to compromise with the EU while the latter has refused anything other than complete capitulation via the backstop.

Ultimately, the UK will face the most disruption in a no-deal Brexit with no future trade deal, but the EU will lose all power and influence over the UK and be faced with a significant competing European power that will free to diverge from the EU policies that are responsible for stifling across Europe the investment, innovation and new technologies that will make or break nations in this century.

947,"&gt; Like many companies in central Europe, Amica has been struggling to find workers. So last year, the Polish manufacturer of household appliances took an unorthodox decision: To help staff up a new factory near Wronki in western Poland, it struck a deal with a local prison to employ between 100 and 200 inmates.

&gt; The arrangement is part of a government plan set up in 2016 to help rehabilitate prisoners. But it is also a sign of the strains being felt by central European companies as booming order books and the legacy of a wave of emigration in the 2000s drive unemployment to record lows, and labour shortages begin to bite.

&gt;Unemployment is now below 4 per cent in the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland and stands at only 5.7 per cent in Slovakia. Meanwhile, a growing number of jobs are left unfilled, especially in labour intensive sectors such as construction and retail. The Czech vacancy rate is more than double the EU average. According to a recent study by the Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies, most countries in the region will hit a “tipping point” at which the lack of workers will start to limit economic growth within the next five years. In Poland, Lithuania and the Czech Republic, it could happen within the next two.

&gt;For many companies, however, the moment where labour shortages limit their production has already arrived. According to Eurostat, 92.3 per cent of Hungarian industrial groups expect a lack of workers to constrain their activities in the coming quarter. In Poland the figure is 48.1 per cent, and in the Czech Republic, 35.1 per cent.
&gt; The shortage of staff has already begun to flow through into higher wages, which are rising at a rapid clip across the region. Earlier this year, workers at Audi’s plant in Gyor in Hungary won a pay rise of 18 per cent, one of the biggest Hungarian unions have secured.

&gt; This is of course welcome news for the region’s workers. But in sectors with low margins, such as retail, transportation and construction, it has begun to eat into profitability. Construction groups, often locked into fixed-price contracts, have been warning for more than a year about the possibility of a jump in bankruptcies if the pressure on costs does not ease.

&gt;An obvious response would be for the countries in the region to open their labour markets to more migrants. However, in the wake of the 2015-16 migration crisis, the politics of letting in foreigners is fraught. Even Poland, which let in over 1m Ukrainians has only taken in the bulk of them on temporary registrations of six-nine months, meaning companies often invest in training staff, only to lose them soon after.

&gt;Instead, governments in the region, who have spent much of the past three years whipping up sentiment against migrants, have preferred to bet on two other horses that do not entail opening their borders: boosting labour force participation, and boosting birth rates.

&gt;The problem is that even if the pro-family policies work, which is not certain, this route will take 15-20 years to have any impact on the labour force. And while some countries, such as Poland and Slovakia, have scope to boost participation rates, particularly among women, others, such as the Czech Republic, have less room for manoeuvre.

&gt;That leaves boosting productivity as the most realistic way to cope with the dearth of workers in the short term. And luckily for the region’s companies, that is something they can do without having to rely on government policy.

&gt;Some are already doing so. One example is Frisco.pl, an online supermarket part-owned by Eurocash, Poland’s biggest food wholesaler. In the company’s new warehouse outside Warsaw, baskets full of goods zip around on conveyor belts, before being loaded on to trolleys by a robot and shipped to customers. The machines have helped cut the number of workers needed to process a given amount of orders by between 60 and 70 per cent, according to Eurocash’s chief executive, Luis Amaral.

&gt;“Automation is the only solution we have,” he says. “If you cannot have people, you have to go to automation.”

&gt;But far more companies need to follow suit.

This is **not** delusion. This is 3rd world banana republic levels of manipulation of political discourse. It is lying through your teeth to obtain what you want. They are gaslighting the population.

People who lived through the dark days of dictatorship in Eastern Europe or other countries know this type of speech all too well. 

When Chemical Ali claims Iraq had everything under control, do you think he wasn't aware of the truth?

When the communist party was raising Stakhanov and his magic work load capacity, do you think they didn't know the truth? When communist regimes were posting absolutely ridiculous levels of agricultural productivity do you think they didn't know?

They are doing this to gaslight. Manipulate the population. 

On one hand it's used as a power move: look at the bullshit I can say, and I'll still get away with it. Why? Because the people love it. Truth doesn't matter to them. 

On the other hand it's used to make truth not matter. Only what matters is the emotional response. Someone raised in this environment will think: ""oh so who's wrong? is it these high ranking political elites or is it me small individual?"" You start doubting logic, facts, reality.

1158,"The EU Parliament has degraded itself

In the dispute over Manfred Weber, the egotisms of the parties have won. The voter may ask himself what his vote is worth if the heads of government decide in the end.

A comment by Ulrich Ladurner


The house of European democracy is the European Parliament: MEPs like to affirm this when asked about their own significance. ""Strengthen us and strengthen European democracy,"" was her message at the European elections at the end of May. Voters believed that. Voter turnout in the EU as a whole, at 50.6 percent, was eight percentage points higher than last time.   
A pound that EU parliamentarians could have used. They only had to agree on a top candidate for the post of EU Commission President. ""Anyone who elects us can have a direct say in one of the EU's most important positions""; with this promise they finally entered the election campaign.

It has always been an exaggerated promise, because the EU Council, i.e. the heads of state and government of the member states, have a say in the selection of the President of the Commission. From the outset, therefore, it would have been difficult for parliamentarians to keep their promises. If, however, none of the top European candidates were to become President of the Commission, then they would not have failed at the Council, but at themselves. 
Despite their self-confident, noble rhetoric, the Members of Parliament have not been able to overcome party-political egotisms and agree on a candidate. The Social Democrats and the Liberals bear the greatest responsibility here because they did not want to support the candidate of the strongest group in Parliament, the Conservative Manfred Weber. It would go too far to describe it as cheating the electorate, but it is always a case of arrogance, or should we say naked incompetence? 
Parliament will be taken less seriously in future
Admittedly, it is not easy for the political groups of different colours to agree on one candidate. But compromises are part of the core business of any parliament that wants to be taken seriously. The parties themselves have stressed time and again after election defeats that they wanted to come together on content and that people were of secondary importance. 
In reality, however, the debate now revolves only around people and their party political affiliations, above all Manfred Weber and his EPP, Frans Timmermans of the Social Democrats and Margarethe Vestager of the Liberals. Contents? No, not at all. 
On Sunday, the heads of state and government will meet to discuss who should occupy the top positions in the EU. Parliament will play a minor role if it does not get its act together by then. The European Union will certainly not break because parliamentarians have degraded themselves in their search for candidates. Nevertheless, this is bad news - for the EU and for its citizens.

The EU is not a static entity, but a dynamic organism that is constantly faced with the question of how it should develop. Parliament will continue to give many answers to this question in the future, but it can expect to be taken less seriously. And it is not a gain for Europe if there is now a shift of power to the Council. Because the EU needs a good balance between its institutions.

The European elections have been presented by the parties as existential elections. Parliament's self-humiliation should therefore also perplex voters: Allegedly (right-wing) barbarians stood at the gates of Brussels. For weeks, people warned, threatened, drummed: A Democratic front was needed, otherwise the EU was in danger of collapse. 
Well, Brussels is still standing, no one has reduced the European institutions to rubble. But the voter may ask himself what his vote is worth now, which he has cast under the impression of a threatening catastrophe created by politicians?

As I said to the other guy, all they ruled is that SW3 failed to provide enough information to prove that the migrants are in a situation of ""imminent risk of irreparable harm."" Basically they said that they can wait. Also that part wasn't specifically referring to SW3 since it was a response to your statement that most migrants are from Bangladesh, from all the reports there are no Bangladeshi on SW3.

&gt;decide, either they are in danger, in which case by international law they should go to the nearest port which is Tunisia and from there apply, or they are not, in which case they do not need saving or ferrying all the way to Italy.

Huh? They are in danger when they are rescued by search-and-rescue vessels like Sea Watch. We can argue on how safe Tunisia is for refugees when there are literally Tunisians fleeing Tunisia as refugees, articles like [https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/driven-suicide-tunisia-unhcr-refugee-shelter-190319052430125.html](this) come out every other month and refugee camps are getting closed on a monthly basis. What is the point of dropping people off in Tunisia if there's a concrete risk of their human rights being infringed upon there? A ""safe port"" isn't any country not at war.

&gt;Refugee status means you have passage to and temporary residence to the first country that is stable enough to let you live in safety (which again, should be either Tunisia or Egypt which are nearer and without the danger of a sea voyage).

The fact that you included Egypt shows how much you know about safe countries in north Africa. Search ""Is it safe to travel to Egypt"" and see what comes out. Or just take my words for it, outside of tourist areas it is not.

&gt;The only one who made a spectacle here is the Captain of SeaWatch3

I disagree and here's why. Why is it that during the past 2 weeks, while SW3 was at bay outside Lampedusa, over 200 migrants landed in Italy without any problems? Anything Salvini does is propaganda: SW3 has popped up in the news before (and personally humiliated him on live tv) so he wants to send a message. He's just focusing media attention on one ship while there are others who are doing the exact same thing but nobody talks about them.

Only Italy and France had a significant drift to the right in the recent european elections, and what's interesting is that it was at the expense of the moderate right. If you take the time to look closer Greens and Liberals (left &amp; center) gained the most seats with the Social Democrats losing less than the Conservatives.

The cities should not be left to the tourists, the population should always come first as it's their fucking cities.

There are plenty of hotels, camp sites and what have you that tourists can use. There's no *right* to be able to rent a cheap apartment in whatever city in whatever country you want to. Besides, imagine being the neighbor to an AirBnB apartment in a popular destination ffs, new people constantly who don't give two shits about the rules and are often there to ""experience the culture"" by getting hammered every night etc.

European cities aren't tourist attractions, they're cities that people live in and that should be the case in the future as well. The Dutch didn't build Amsterdam for the tourists for example, it just happens to be the case that tourists like how Amsterdam turned out. The Dutch shouldn't be punished for that, it's still their city and if tourists can't get their dream vacation in Amsterdam they need to save some more money or go somewhere else.",Denmark,/r/europe/comments/c5tsxw/kraków_joins_euwide_call_to_fight_airbnb/es5fl2y/,Dnarg,1561610241
1267,"Absolutely nowhere did I state that communism is ""sweet"". But just because I favour capitalism over communism doesn't mean I need to blind myself to the merits of communism and the flaws of capitalism. Both systems have pros and cons, just not in equal proportions.

The world isn't black and white, it's mostly grey.

But you seem to be completely unable to grasp nuance. Communism is either absolutely bad, or absolutely good, there is no in between. The poverty of Cuba is either absolutely America's fault or absolutely Cuba's fault, it can't be a mix of the two.

I did state in an earlier comment that both communism and the embargo are to blame for Cuba's woes, yet you write ""american foulplay results in all commie countries being shithole countries"". You're unable to perceive nuance, even when it's handed to you on a silver platter.

&gt;And Irans government doesnt own practically the whole national market and control price setting.

The public sector accounting for 40% of GDP is certainly very high, but a very fast cry from ""practically the whole national market""

&gt;It is also very easy to start businesses there.

There's plenty of capitalist Nations where it's hard to start a business. It's bad for the economy, but does not a communist country make. Again, nuance.",Bavarian in Canada,/r/europe/comments/c5rjaf/gas_explosion_in_vienna_just_now/es5fm0w/,Cortical,1561610266
1268,"Around one in six (16.5 %) of young people aged 20-34 were neither in employment nor in education and training (NEET) in the European Union (EU) in 2018. This corresponds to approximately 15 million young people.

The share of people not in employment, education or training (the NEET rate) for those aged 20-34 varied considerably across the EU Member States in 2018.

The lowest NEET rates for people aged 20–34 in 2018 were in Sweden (8.0%), the Netherlands (8.4%), Luxembourg (9.9%) and Malta (10.1%).

In contrast, the highest NEET rates were recorded in Italy (28.9%) and Greece (26.8%). In these two Member States, more than a quarter of all young people aged 20–34 were neither in employment nor in education and training.

There is a considerable difference in the NEET rate between young women and young men. For women aged 20-34, the NEET rate in 2018 was 20.9%, compared with 12.2% for 20-34 year old men.",Romania,/r/europe/comments/c6130i/eu_1_in_6_young_people_not_in_employment_or/es5fqax/,filosoful,1561610382

That's not saying that the majority of Romanians today are loading Jews by the hundreds into death trains or evicting them into a barren wilderness to starve and freeze, but rather that they absolve the time's Romania of any responsibility and instead say something along the lines of ""oh that was all Germany's doing, not on us.""

I personally don't much care about what the Romanian opinions are on this matter so I've never looked into the polls on the matter that this person claims to have see. If it is the case that there are such majorities opinions among Romanians in the present day, then it doesn't really matter much that were born long after the fact; those majorities are wrong in this very moment, since the Romanians of the time were absolutely on board. If not, great for Romanians.

I thought that you were disputing how Romania was the second worst state participator in the Holocaust after Nazi Germany, but if that's not in question for you then that's all I'm after.

1385,"I wasn't trying to make a case of Yugoslavism on reddit. As you said, there's a ton of history to go through of the individual kingdoms and the effects that colonisation by greater powers had on the Balkans, as well as linguistic and other cultural markers - too much to talk about for a reddit post where I don't think we could convince each other.

The point I want to make is that the wars themselves had many trademarks of a civil war - regardless of when republics declared independence. Just look at the way that ethnic groups were composed pre-war and post-war. Bosnia looks nothing like it did before, with hard borders and homogeneity for each ethnic group whilst Croatia lost most of it's Serb minority in Krajina. These were drastic changes from a norm that had existed for centuries.

The fact is that for the better part of a century, people lived and worked together under a unified Yugoslavia, first the Kingdom and then SFRJ. Any war involved there is going to be ""civil"" as you are effectively fighting people you might have gone to school with, worked with, supported National teams with, done military service with and in some cases, split families down lines that before they would never consider. After the war broke out, it didn't matter who you were friends with, it mattered what side of the bridge you lived on. 

The war didn't start because Croats, Slovenes and Bosniaks suddenly realised ""hey we aren't that similar"" and declared independence. The country was in economic crisis, people didn't know where they'd get there next meal, hyperinflation was through the roof, didn't know how to feed their kids and got desperate, inevitably turning to the extremes that placed all the blame on another group and promised a better future for their group.",Ex-Yugo Diaspora,/r/europe/comments/c53y4e/on_this_day_28_years_ago_two_new_countries/es587hy/,kingboz,1561604063

1426,"&gt; Does it matter if it's a 100% or 60% ?

Yes, because the premise is wrong to begin with. 

The way Trump makes it appear is as though all countries were throwing money into a common pot and pay a common allied army out of that.

That's not how it works, though, because in reality each and every ally spends money on its own separate military (notwithstanding the fact that those militaries are closely coordinated on a command level; they remain separate armies belonging to the states which pay for them). 

And by the way, not every penny the US spends on its military is related to NATO (see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NATO_operations for a list of ongoing NATO operations). There are no NATO missions in the Golf of Oman, the Indian Ocean or the Pacific, for instance, yet those theatres are exactly where most of the active US military operations are going on, whilst NATO countries have nothing at all to do with it. 

Far from it, actually: 

&gt; So, altogether, direct **US expenses on defence in Europe are estimated to range between US$30.7bn in 2017 and US$36.0bn in 2018, or between 5.1% and 5.5% of the total US defence budget**, as measured by the IISS. These numbers, it could be argued, put the total defence spending of European NATO allies – US$239.1bn – in something of a different light.

1434,"&gt; That does not matter, we are talking about people who are distressed at sea. How do we know that they are not escaping war and persecution without letting them in and allowing them to make their case? Are you a tarot reader? Let them in, clean them up, let them make their case for asylum or whatever and kick out those who do not have a right to stay. Simple enough, isn't it?

And yet.... http://www.ansa.it/english/news/2019/06/26/sea-watch-migrants-desperate-after-echr-ruling_4b72d5bc-e71b-4ea1-9189-3c40186da9eb.html the European Court of **Human Rights** said otherwise.

Also: decide, either they are in danger, in which case by international law they should go to the nearest port which is Tunisia and from there apply, or they are not, in which case they do not need saving or ferrying all the way to Italy.

Astonishing that I have to explain this, but even the status of refugee do not grant you a magical visa where you can choose whatever country you want to live in. Refugee status means you have passage to and temporary residence to the first country that is stable enough to let you live in safety (which again, should be either Tunisia or Egypt which are nearer and without the danger of a sea voyage). That is also the main reason why the 90% of Syrian refugees ended in Turkey first, and then were distributed around Europe (to which I have nothing against) due to the fact that Turkey was unable to sustain the volume of people entering their borders.

&gt; edit. Also, resources should be distributed proportionally around EU states, but guess who isn't interested in redescussing the current treaties and would rather make a spectacle of the situation?

Maybe if ""democratic Europeans"" didn't go in and support a coup that brought a nationalist, rabidly anti-Russian regime that alienated half of Ukrainian population (and about 80-95% in some regions) - none of these things would have happened.

I'm really fucking sick of these idiotic statements that act as though Crimea and rebellions happened in a vacuum.

""[There are no atheists in foxholes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_are_no_atheists_in_foxholes)""

&gt;The statement ""There are no atheists in foxholes"" is an aphorism used to argue that in times of extreme stress or fear, such as during war (""in foxholes""), all people will believe in, or hope for, a higher power (and there are therefore no atheists).[1]
&gt;
&gt;The origin of the quotation is uncertain.[2] The U.S. military chaplain William Thomas Cummings may have said it in a field sermon during the Battle of Bataan in 1942,[3] though scholars have been unable to find a firsthand witness to the sermon.[4][5] Other sources credit Lieutenant Colonel Warren J. Clear (or the anonymous sergeant he spoke with there), who was also at Bataan and published the usage in 1942;[6] or Lieutenant Colonel William Casey. The phrase is often attributed to war correspondent Ernie Pyle;[7][8][9][10] however, no such source published prior to Pyle's death is known. It was also quoted by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in remarks broadcast from the White House as part of a February 7, 1954, American Legion Program. With slightly different wording, the statement appears much earlier in press reports dating from the end of the First World War, while a similar concept has been sought in *Plato's Laws*.[2]",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/c5ozpq/baptized_russian_soldiers_won_wwii_while_atheists/es45d2q/,vokegaf,1561577441

1708,"&gt; Comunidades have bodies to promote regions outside Spain not to manage diplomacy and foreign affairs that is a exclusive Spanish Gov competence.

This is what bothers you.

&gt;There offices around the world cost millions of euros.

And this is the excuse. Of course, it's once again the typical Spanish complex that it needs to dominate Catalonia over every ""slight"" presented. Since I already told you the cost is low (and they actually produce returns through promoting business) you're just mad that they are actually pro-Catalonia *or* you're too deep into the propaganda that you can't even accept that.

&gt;Again and again the same. The Constitution clearly states that the competence to call for a referendum is exclusive to the Spanish Government. The Generalitat of Catalonia cannot call for a referendum without the permission of the Spanish Government. The offence is not calling for the referendum, the offence is invading the Spanish Government competence and disobeying the Constitutional Court rule when they warn you invading Spanish Government competences is and offence.

Nope, the offence is rebellion, and that's a fact. Rebellion which in the penal code is typified as an armed assault, which did not happen, so it's a political trial. Breaking the Constitution is actually not a crime, or at least it's not typified this way. You can read the auto or whatever, it's easy to check.

&gt;they disobeyed the Constitutional Court and they created a lot of social unrest and divided families 

Nope. This is also spanish propaganda. I live in one of the most ""Spanish areas"" of Catalonia (you won't even hear Catalan at all here) and nobody gives a shit. Most of my Catalan friends have Spanish families etc. and nobody gives a shit. But hey, it's once again the ""breaking families"" meme that Albert Ribera loves, so it must be true right?

&gt;not even having 50.1% of the votes for it. It is deeply undemocratic to push for a secession under that circumstances.

What's undemocratic is making up this % without a referendum. We just don't know which % of Catalans want to seccede, and the normal way of finding that out (how it's been done in 1st world countries, in democracies) is by voting.

&gt;FYI Mas is coming back as soon he finish his disqualification to be in public office next year. Mas represents the Catalan bourgeois who are really under all this mess.

Oh he'll try, he's a fucking rat. He'll eat shit though.

&gt;3% is alive and well in Catalonia and the rest of Spain.

1755,"Thank you for the detailed response, however my point was that the design of the carbon tax is to be revenue neutral and the way in which that can be achieved is still open for debate. Tax credits are one possibility and I still don't know why this would be a wealth transfer towards the wealthy, but there are other means in which the dividends from the carbon tax levied at the production stage would be given back to consumers. The whole point is to make emission heavy products more expensive and less desirable and to incentivise production methods that can reduce this. It wouldn't be a flat tax on all products but proportional to the emission footprint. In any case, what mechanism would you like to see to achieve this revenue neutrality for the carbon tax? 

I see your point about the greens, but I wasn't really advocating for having exclusively green governments in power all over the place. In Europe for example they are just more likely to enter coalition governments and they could only push for a few big item issues from their platform. This could be phasing out of coal, gender neutral bathrooms or whatever is their key issue in the country they run. I see carbon taxes as a cross-party item, no matter who is in power in the next 10 years in any of the G20 nations will have to implement something like this and I hope there is enough debate on the matter to find the best, most transparent and efficient way of doing it.",European Union,/r/europe/comments/c5b585/french_nuclear_to_suffer_after_exclusion_from_eus/es3tjp0/,this_toe_shall_pass,1561570324

1768,"&gt; It is not about Erdogan man idk why everything that includes Turkey became a Erdogan topic. This was the same before Erdogan and will stay the same after Erdogan.

Because it's Erdogan that said those events were *justified*. Most previous leaders had said it was unfortunate but not a genocide. Erdogan took that to a new level saying it was ""the right thing to do at the time"".

&gt; Armenian government or people does not matter if Turkey is going to lose money or land they wont accept the genocide.

Turkey is going to lose anything. Where does this idea come from jesus christ. Who's gonna force Turkey make land concessions? Who's gonna force Turkey pay reparations? All of that can happen only if the UN, EU, US, Russia and others place heavy economic sanctions on Turkey the cost of which would be worse than paying reparations. Since this scenario is literally impossible **and** the Armenian government has never had and will probably never have any claims on land or reparations, this idea becomes merely a product of your or you government's imagination.

&gt; The world knows it from one side because of the Armenian propaganda.

So you're telling me a small country of 3 million people has more influence in the world than Turkey which is among the largest economies in the world with key geolocation? Because it's not only western countries with an Armenian diaspora that have passed such a bill but also numerous others that don't have any Armenian population or influence. 

&gt; They have been using genocide for their internal politics.

Now if you could tell us what the reasoning of other countries is that don't have affiliation with Armenia or Armenians and so can't use it for internal politics but have still recognized it, that'd be great. 

&gt; Again state views wont change on this matter but when I see Armenians backtracking from archives and a joint commission it makes me feel like they don't care about the truth. Open the archives get historians from all around the world work on them and come up with a report. Should not be that hard to do.

My understanding is that Russia had stated that it would have left the Council of Europe if its voting privileges were not returned to it.  I've no idea how plausible a threat that is, but I don't know of any real reason to doubt it.

https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/world/europe/council-of-europe-russia-crimea.html

&gt;Those voting to restore Russia’s full rights in the council, which is separate from the European Union, argued that if Russia left the organization — as it had threatened to do — it would deny Russian citizens the right to bring cases before the European Court of Human Rights, a part of the council.

I understand that the Council of Europe does offer members some (very limited) level of influence over other members, and Russia bailling on it would probably end that in Russia.  It's possible that a number of red countries saw this as overplaying the not-particularly-strong hand that the Council of Europe has, and that as a tool, it's more-appropriate to try to promote minor internal social policy changes or whatnot.

That being said, I can also certainly understand someone saying ""if you aren't going to take a stand on that, is there anything that you *are* willing to take a stand on?""

1882,""" German Chancellor Angela Merkel told Kurdish students in Germany that Kurds do not deserve a state because it would not “serve peace in the region,” according to an article in DW News in Arabic.

Merkel told the students in Lower Saxony that while Kurds deserve “fair conditions” and autonomy in Iraq, they don’t deserve independence. The Kurdistan region in northern Iraq is currently an autonomous region. 

...

Germany has been generally supportive of the Kurdistan Regional Government. It supported training the Kurdish Peshmerga, the armed forces of the region, to fight Islamic State. It has hosted Kurdish leaders.

However the response to the questions about Kurdish rights to independence reveals Germany’s own checkered record when it comes to Iraq and the Kurds. In the 1980s, German companies and engineers helped build Saddam Hussein’s bunkers, according to a 2003 account at Wired. 27 German firms helped Saddam Hussein in the 1980s, according to The Independent.

Even more disturbing, considering Germany’s role in the Holocaust, the report notes that “during the period to 1991, the German authorities permitted weapons co-operation with Iraq” and German assistance was allegedly “given to Iraq for the development of poison gas used in the 1988 massacre of Kurds.” A chemical warfare facility was designed by a German company according to The Christian Science Monitor.

1913,"What part should I read that says there's no such evidence? Do YOU read what I'm writing? Did YOU read the report?

Because it sure doesn't look like it.. 

Here's a quote from the [report itself](http://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/bitstream/JRC117088/eur29778en_results_of_an_eu_wide_comparison_of_quality_related_characteristics_of_food_products.pdf) (page 13):

&gt; Different composition For 31 % of the products (visualised in red in Figure 4) differences in composition were not indicated by a different appearance on the front-of-pack; 9 % (11 out of 128 surveyed products) of them had an identical front-of-pack, while the composition was different, and for 22 % (28 out of 128 surveyed products) the features of the front-of-pack were similar. For the latter group a degree of uncertainty exists, depending on the subjective judgment to which extent features of the front-of-pack determine similarity or dissimilarity. Twenty-seven percent of the products that differed in composition had also a different frontof-pack appearance, indicating clearly to the consumers that the products are differentiated. 

Here's the full conclusion page:

&gt; CONCLUSIONS The EU wide comparison study conducted by the JRC demonstrated that:  
&gt;  
&gt; 31 % of the products included in this survey had identical composition and the same or a similar front-of-pack arrangement, independent of the Member State were they were offered;  
&gt;  
&gt; 2 % of the products had an identical composition, but the front-of-pack was different;  
&gt;  
&gt; 9 % of the products differed in composition but without differentiating the appearance of the front-of-pack in at least one of the 19 surveyed Member States;  
&gt;  
&gt; 22 % of the products differed in composition and indicated to a certain extent those differences by variations in the graphical design on the front-of-pack;  
&gt;  
&gt; 27 % of the products differed in composition and indicated those differences by a different appearance of the front-of-pack;   
&gt;  
&gt; the level of detail used to describe ingredients, the sequence in which they are given in the list of ingredients and the way how individual elements for the nutrition declaration (content of energy, protein, fat, etc) are estimated, has an influence on the the information provided on the label of food products;   
&gt;  
&gt;the results described in this report describe the situation found on the markets of the participating Member States during the period the survey was carried out (NovemberDecember 2018);   
&gt;  
&gt; *compositional differences of the products found in the survey must not be interpreted to constitute a difference in product quality;*   
&gt;  
&gt; **no indication of consistent differentiation of products related to certain geographical regions of the participating Member States was observed;**   
&gt;  
&gt; even if a large sample of products offered on the markets of several Member States have been taken, the results of the survey must not be interpreted as being representative of the whole population of food products offered in those Member States;   
&gt;  
&gt; the involvement of brand owners in the case-by-case evaluation of a potential breach of the UCPD for re-conciliation of the findings of the assessment with the product knowledge of the brand owner is necessary;   
&gt;  
&gt; an additional case-specific assessment by a competent national authority would be required to assess whether the identical marketing of products with significantly different composition would constitute a misleading practice, violating EU law, taking into account other relevant factors (notably the legitimacy and the objectivity of any justification provided by the brand owner). 

*Whilst it is sayd we shouldn't interpret the report as to constitute a difference in product quality, there's no details about this in the entire report or Annex; The quality of the product itself was clearly not checked since the report doesn't actually say nothing else about the actual quallity of the products..* 

*It would be amazing to find that there are 22% of the checked products with different compositions and identical labels but somehow think they are the same quality..*

**As for the consistent differentiation of products related to certain geographical regions, this really doesn't help at all.. Should the fact that some product is different in Germany and Belgium somehow make me fell better that there's also a difference between those and Romania?**

If there is any conclusion (and it's black on white written) that can be drawn from this report is that we have a problem.. Maybe it's not even a clear west/east divide on every problem but there's clearly a problem..

No it doesn’t the vast majority of polls have had a clear lead for remain and even more so when it is pitched against the current deal. 

&gt;That's 70% for parties that are in favour of Brexit

Not everyone voted because of Brexit so you can only really count the Brexit party/UKIP as a pro-Brexit vote which the pro-remain parties combined got a higher vote share than they do. Polls showed that Conservative were pretty split in how they voted and Labour was largely remain with their candidates being strongly in favour of remain. 

&gt;Labour's 2017 manifesto specifically states 'Labour accepts the referendum result',

Oh come on this is just a dumb propaganda technique, people voted against the government of the day and it isn’t really sensible to claim that people voted Labour because they wanted Brexit.

The only hope they have in this scenario is if they form some sort of electoral pact with Farage. Farage knows full well what you've just described though, that Boris would use an increased majority as cover to return to May's withdrawal agreement that the rabid Brexiters hate - why would he sign up to it? Plus if the Tory leadership actually tried to do business with Farage, they know they'd lose moderate middle-class voters for the next 20 or 30 years - this is not an action people would forget.

&gt;**The European Commission has today announced the higher education institutions from all over Europe that will be part of the first** **“European Universities”** **alliances. They will enhance the quality and attractiveness of European higher education and boost cooperation between institutions, their students and staff.**   
  
&gt;  
&gt;Out of 54 applications received, 17 European Universities involving 114 higher education institutions from 24 Member States were selected (see [Annex](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/api/files/attachment/857749/ANNEX.pdf.pdf)), based on an evaluation carried out by 26 independent external experts, including rectors, professors and researchers, appointed by the Commission. European Universities are transnational alliances of higher education institutions from across the EU that share a long-term strategy and promote European values and identity. The initiative is designed to significantly strengthen mobility of students and staff, and foster the quality, inclusiveness and competitiveness of European higher education.    
&gt;  
&gt;Tibor **Navracsics**, Commissioner for Education, Culture, Youth and Sport, said: *""I am pleased to see the ambition of the first 17 European Universities, which will act as role models for others across the EU. They will enable the next generations of students to experience Europe by studying in different countries. I am convinced that this initiative, a key building block of the European Education Area, will be a real game changer for higher education in Europe, boosting excellence and inclusion.”*",,/r/europe/comments/c5on59/first_17_european_universities_selected_a_major/es2zkl0/,Robi_damian,1561548313

2019,"&gt; i remember seeing alot of hungarians and romanians complaining about some new law which took away some rights to language, but i might be wrong.
Yep, that's the one i wrote about - per the new law Ukraine will no longer fund schools with NO teaching in Ukrainian. Of course they can just fund such schools themselves. And of course they can still learn their languages in Ukrainian schools, this right is explicitly guaranteed by that very same law. 

&gt;I thought the whole reason to as why there is war in the donbass was because these people felt more russian than ukrainians and didnt want a ukraine which distances itself from russia.
I'd say the whole reason is that Russia has an empire complex and views Ukraine as it's ""sphere of influence"" and their best and tried way to keep such countries on a short leash is instigating and supporting a simmering war.

&gt; Ukrainians in Austria aren’t a minority, but simply migrants
Interesting where would you draw the line between the two. Hungarians make up around 0.3% of Ukrainian population. Ukrainians in Austria are at just below 0.1%.

This women and men are NGO who get support for LGBT rights from west. But before 2014 all of them worked for NGOs who support absolutely different ideas. 

In Ukraine communist hate gays and when they was allowed in Ukraine protest together with Nationalist against LGBT parades and what is more important - in parliament stop any propositions to support LGBT rights. 

 &gt;Do you really think that they need to create fake violence towards LGBT? I think there is already plenty of that. 

Do you think we are all idiots in Ukraine? Do you think we do not have any other to do? 


""The most dangerous nationalist leader"" who fights against lgbt rights - Evgen Karas is leader of organisation C14. Do you know what does it mean 14? it means that it was only 14 people in organisation. 

But everyone knows that this guy Karas makes business on nationalism. He got paid for many actions he did. And He did not do actions without payment. 

Fake LGBT leaders like money too.

What you cannot do, is go to a PUBLICALY funded school, where you will study in minority languages ONLY, with no classes in Ukrainian. Hungary, Romania and Russia are welcome to open and fund private schools with no classes in Ukrainian, if they so wish.

2305,"That's a very different question. It's untrue however that EU trade is killing labour opportunities within the union.

It can also be said that concentrating production in places that specialize in them is more economical, both monetarily and environmentally. Better use factories in Europe than build up new factories everywhere else (where lower environmental/safety standards may also apply...)

The EU is forced to import a lot of things. Tropical natural products, (or just food in general, especially in winter), natural resources (rare earths; can't do much without them nowadays), some foreign companies may have technological advantage for compelling products. Exports are necessary to counteract economical imbalance. 

Open markets allow specialization, allow efficiency, and better quality of life. If Italian companies have tradition and qualification in the production of Wine, Pasta, or medical equipment, why not let them do it. If Quebec has clean, cheap electricity through its hydro potential, why not let them take care of electricity-intensive industries (aluminium).

He had struggled to get his Greek papers for 18 years cause the laws are fucked up and it's generally hard for immigrants to be recognized as citizens so for all these years he had no Greek but no Nigerian status.

2328,"Regarding the Euro and its effect on unemployment: a local and soft currency can be used to hide low levels of productivity. A shared and strong currency exposes those lower productivity levels a lot easier than a local soft currency.

This happens because when the currency is local, it allows the prices of local products to be a lot lower than the prices of the imported products, and thus allowing people to have jobs even if the economy is underperforming. With a common currency, the prices are adjusted to the levels of the currency's value, and therefore those goods that were locally produced before the common currency are no longer competitive with the goods imported after the common currency is introduced.

For example, in Greece, before the Euro, there were a lot of businesses that created a lot of products for the domestic market only. The quality of those products was usually lower from the imported ones, but they were a lot cheaper than the imported ones, even if the local production was many times smaller than the imported goods production, especially with very high import taxes.

After the Euro was introduced, small businesses in Greece could no longer be profitable, because the imported goods became a lot cheaper. For example, no local shop can compete with Zara in cheap clothing, due to the fact that Zara had a huge and very cheap clothing production line, buys materials a lot cheaper since it buys huge quantities etc.

In other words, the Euro brought a level of competition in domestic markets that was unheard of and forced many small shops to close. Greece was not prepared to compete on a global scale, since it's businesses only targeted the domestic market.

And that's the reason the Euro's success is so different in different countries: in countries that could compete globally, the Euro is a success, and in countries that could not compete globally, the Euro is a failure.

Would going back to national currencies help Greece and other economies to recover and reduce unemployment? Not really. Globalization is a thing nowadays. What would happen if Greece went back to drachma is that the goods it would produce would be sold to foreign markets in prices that no Greek could touch, resulting in huge lack of products for the local market, because it would be hugely profitable to just export everything due to low value of the Drachma. And those levels or exports wouldn't help the local economy because they would be isolated in specific domains, because Greece's economy was, is, and will be underperforming and even if that wasn't the case, Greece is a small market and can't produce everything.",,/r/europe/comments/c54rr8/u6_unemployment_in_europe_2018/es2k93f/,axilmar,1561527391

2356,"Some languages assign a grammatical gender not only to living beings but also to inanimate objects. It's something quite arbitrary, based on etimology and language evolution, and even related languages may have differences: milk in Italian is male, but it's female in Spanish; sea in Italian is male, but it's female in French, and so on.

In English, speaking of Alice you would say that Bob is a friend of *hers*, and speaking of Bob you would say that Alice is a friend of *his*. In a gendered language you apply the same concept to everything, and you just have to know (or to learn) that e.g. door in Italian is female, bed is male, shoe is female, coat rack is male, and so on.

Although not necessarily related to gender, it's worth noting that many languages modify adjectives too. In English you say one red apple, and two red apples, i.e. red is always red. In some other languages you would say one red apple, but two *reds* apples, and many would distinguish between a red male object and a red female object.

Some Italian examples:

Il libro *rosso* — The red book (male singular)  
I libri *rossi* — The red books (male plural)  
La scarpa *rossa* — The red shoe (female singular)  
Le scarpe *rosse* — The red shoes (female plural)

2383,"To me, it sometimes happens that I've assumed the gender was X and then at the end of a story I realise the gender was Y – which can alter the meaning. It's a bit confusing, yes.

One advantage of gendered languages is that we can often omit the subject and still maintain the reference.

In Czech, for example, I can say thing like *šla tam* or *šel tam* 
 – in English, it means literally ""went there"", but you don't know who (I/you/he/she/it/we/they). As a Czech, I know it means ""(she) went there"" and ""(he) went there"", so with a proper context, e.g. when we're talking about someone's girlfriend or a boyfriend, I know which one the verb is referring to just from its form.

This is an advantage of inflected languages; they often allow to ""condense"" a message without losing information in the process and having to repeat nouns or pronouns too often.

2390,"Probably not much of interest.

In computer science, there is something called a ""hash"", which is basically a (comparatively small) number derived from a lot of data.  The idea is that if you change the data at all, you get another number, and it's very hard to figure out how to fiddle the data such that you get a number with a particular value.

A ""blockchain"" is where you take a block of data, hash it to get that small number, and put the hash and a bunch of data into another block.  This ""chains"" the block together.

If any change is made to any block, the idea is that it will produce a different hash to go into the next block, and that will in turn change the hash of *that* block.

If at any point any block in the chain is altered, each hash after it in the chain should be different.

So, what's the point of this?

This has some useful properties that lets Bitcoin and similar systems work.  Basically, people claim to have transferred funds from Persona A to Persona B at some point in the past and publicly broadcast the result and it is encoded into a blockchain.  If Person A ever claims not to have transferred those funds, it's quickly obvious that a change has been made.

Most of the time, it's better in most ways to just have a single, trusted party that keeps track of all the transactions and if you ask ""did A transfer to B"", you can trust them.  That's the way, say, banks work.  Bitcoin, via use of a blockchain, is designed to avoid requiring a trusted party, because for various reasons it wants to *not* give any single party the power to change things.

What this is probably talking about is in registering rental agreements so that neither a renter nor landlord can go back and claim that the contract contained/didn't contain something other than what it did.

However, for rentals, this only really makes much sense if you don't trust your government to act as a trusted central registry of rental agreements, which I doubt is seriously an issue in Malta.  So my guess is that there isn't a good technical reason to make use of a blockchain-based system.

A couple possibilities:

* Corruption.  Someone with government affiliations wants funding and is making a blockchain-based system.

* Hype.  Blockchains *are* technically-interesting.  I remember when I first whacked into the idea, years before Bitcoin made it trendy, and I remember mulling over the technical guarantees.  Problem is that after Bitcoin made the news, various people have been trying to wedge blockchains into all sorts of systems where they really don't make much sense.  It's like, oh, I don't know.  XML.  Java.  Things that had periods of a lot of visibility, where they got money spent on them because they had disproportionate recognition due to them having a lot of publicity for aiming to address some particular problem.

* Malta wanting to find a way to subsidize blockchain R&amp;D because it believes (possibly because of hype) that there are major technical possibilities there and wants to build expertise in the field.  There are legitimately times where it's worth subsidizing a product that itself isn't worthwhile if it means that you build an industry in the area that will pay off and wouldn't otherwise be funded.    I doubt that this is an example of that, but who knows.

I've seen a couple articles about countries talk about funding or getting into blockchain-related things, so it's not just Malta.

Where did you find that quote from him? I can find quotes of him talking about LNG but its always about how temporariiy low LNG prices make renewables look less expensive because they cheaply fill the demand spike issue of renewables (even tho its still fossil fuel)

&gt;https://publicintegrity.org/environment/venezuela-head-polishes-image-with-oil-dollars/

Yeah I saw that but the thing is if you read his wiki profile you see that politically he was and has been a typical lefty in his political outlook with particular interest in Latin America since high school and working over there since the 80s. It would seem his work for Venezuela stems from that. 
But regardless I'm not sure what PR work for Venezuela in 2004 has to do with nuclear. Like there were *A LOT* of lefties who embarassed themselves by embracing Venezuela back then and its consistent with my view of him as a leftist who got pragmatic about the limitations of renewables. 

&gt;But to deny the nuclear industry has a well-funded lobbying apparatus is a bit of a joke

Gonna need a source for that. skeptical about that. Hasn't like every nuclear plant been public owned/managed because *holy shit its nuclear power*? What is a privately held nuclear power company? There are private companies that mine it but I can't imagine that's a super powerful industry given how niche nuclear power is. Nuclear  consumption is pretty equivalent to renewables (like 4% to 2%) so I think renewables have about as much lobbying $$ behind them from interested parties. 

&gt; Given new nuclear ventures are failing left right and cente, even this doesn't feel far fetched.

Where are nuclear plants ""failing""? They've been getting cllosed to some pretty extreme reactions to a failure in a 2nd world communist state (in one case) and environmental disaster in the other. 

&gt; Overselling nuclear is a good way to get rid of all that pesky government funding meant to displace fossil fuels without gaining too much tangible results.

I dont understand the logic. Funding to build new nuclear plants doesnt need to come at the expense of funding for renewables. Its not zero-sum. And how wld there not be tangible results?? The energy would be produced cheaper and with no carbon? What tangible result do you suspect nuclear would not deliver on that would somehow empower fossil fuels as a result?

https://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/unexploded-bombs-in-germany-the-lethal-legacy-of-world-war-ii-a-584091.html

&gt; An estimated 20,000 delay-action bombs were dropped on Oranienburg during the war because it had a suspected atomic bomb research site, the Heinkel aircraft factory and a pharmaceutical plant. They were designed to explode between two and 146 hours after hitting the ground, to disrupt clearing up work and cause chaos.
&gt;
&gt;But many failed to go off because Oranienburg has soft soil with a hard layer of gravel underneath. That meant bombs would penetrate the earth, bounce off the gravel and come to rest underground with their tips pointing back upwards. In that position gravity stops the chemical detonators from working.

2444,"A chair in English does not have any grammatical gender that would somehow modify the rest of the sentence.

*A blue chair stood in the room.* You can replace the chair with any singular noun and nothing else changes. If English was a gendered language, other words and word endings would be modified depending on the ""gender"" of the chair. In Czech, for instance, chair (židle) is ""feminine."" If you replace it with words with different genders, the rest of the sentence is modified accordingly. 

Modrá židle stála v místnosti. (A blue chair stood in the room.)

Modr**ý** stůl stál v místnosti. (A blue table stood in the room.) (table is masculine)

Modr**é** kuře stál**o** v místnosti. (A blue chicken stood in the room.) (chicken is neuter)

2543,"Shellenberger runs a nuclear lobbying firm so his neutrality is very much disputable. He also has a long history of spreading misinformation about organisations he doesn't agree with.

He also defends all faults of nuclear ventures. For instance his lobbying firm has been very active in South Korea where it lobbied for more nuclear power plants. When it was revealed that the plans were highly corrupt, they attempted to cover it up.

When the cover up failed, they tried to use the revealed corruption in the nuclear sector as evidence that the corruption in the sector was out in the clear, and being fought, completely disregarding the preceding decade where it wasn't. Only God knows how much corruption wasn't revealed.

He's also in favour of helping the North Koreans with their nuclear venture, which I guess at least means he's principled?

His lobbying firm has also received a lot of controversy for appointing people with basically no qualifications as ""experts"". He also likes to overstate his own qualifications. He's an cultural anthropologist.

He writes off criticism by attacking the people criticising him, saying they're funded by the fossil fuel industry. Quite an ironic claim, since he's been contracted by the fossil fuel nation of Venezuela before to help them with their public relations.

The idea that TPP is a mechanism to create an alliance structure surrounding China is a fiction. Under those provisions, a car could be made 55% in China and 45% in Vietnam and would get into the US no problem. It's quite frankly a bad agreement. It'd function no differently than the WTO where China could exploit it and then the US would have to follow Rule of Law and have no good recourse.

On top of that, the US already has trade agreements with 6/11 of those countries and of the remaining 5, Japan represents &gt;90% of GDP. And the US is in active negotiations for a bilateral agreement with Japan anyways.

The only countries worth negotiating with at a multilateral level from the US perspective are Mexico/Canada and the EU.

On the plus side, the Tories plus DUP have only a tiny (currently 2 seat) parliamentary majority. Boris' election is likely to be the final straw that prompts some moderate Tory MPs to defect to the Lib Dems or become independents (Philip Lee, Guto Bebb and Antoinette Sandbach have all been mentioned a number of times). There are also a couple of senior Tory MPs on top of this (Ken Clarke and Dominic Grieve) who have said publicly that they would vote for a no-confidence motion in any government that pursues no deal.

2608,"&gt;yea it was a messy assassination    
&gt;we are talking about killing spies, if the UK did, or China, or Japan, they wouldn't openly say it...     
    
Messy is a bit of an understatement, though. In their attempt to kill their target (which they failed to do) they put countless innocent lives at risk, resulting in the death of one and the injury and hospitalisation of two others. It cost the UK government millions of £s cleaning up the mess they made in order to be sure no more people were harmed. It turned that corner of Salisbury into a no-go zone for months. All of this because they chose a ridiculous, reckless method of assassination.      
    
And they didn't simply deny it - they then actively spread the message that it was all one big conspiracy orchestrated by the UK to make Russia look bad. When the two suspects were caught on camera, the Russian state continued its disinformation campaign, first suggesting the footage was fake, then staging an interview with the two suspects which showed they were simply 'two innocent tourists' and this was all part of the UK and the West's anti-Russian agenda. Then of course further digging revealed the two 'tourists' were in fact decorated agents of the GRU, proving these officers are all total fuck-ups...   
    
Not that I think Russia should be 'out in the cold' forever, or anything. But as long as its lead by crooks, waging a war on its neighbour and doing this kind of shit on European soil, not sure we should usher them back in so readily. Maybe one day we'll see Navalny in power, and everything will change (although he'd probably be killed/imprisoned if he ever actually got close).",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/c54kix/european_countries_vote_in_the_pace_on_russia/es1t6xd/,AdaptedMix,1561505129

2) Deer are not relevant where I live nor where I buy my produce from. My diet causes a whole lot less accidental victims than a corpse based one. It also doesn't kill intentionally. Protecting crops in general is allowed. Same as defending your home from 'pests'. Whatever option gives the least suffering has preference.

3) [If the world went vegan tomorrow a whole lot of forest could be reclaimed.](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/7y82do/the_land_we_could_save_by_not_consuming_animals/)

4) Methane from animals is a big problem. There are 60+ billion land animals bred and killed each year. They are responsible for &gt;25% of worldwide methane emissions. Animal farming is also the leading cause of ocean acidification. Veganism isn't for the environment, but for the animals. The environment is a nice and very welcome bonus. You could further reduce your impact and pollution from diet within the ethics of veganism by eating less rice, more other staples.

5) You're right. The vegan position is to stop suffering as far as practically possible.

So if you'd like to get back to substance I'm happy to.

The EU coupling politics to financial market access will end badly for the EU, much as the US trying to do the same with trade will end badly. It'd be different if the Swiss (or the UK..) were acting in bad faith, or were not acting responsibly but given that isn't the case, it looks like the EU trying to use its sheer size to get concessions in other areas.   

The problem for the EU is that it isn't a big fish when it comes to financial services, it is dependent on world markets, and largely on markets outside of the EU. 

It has tried in the past to build markets internally, but generally it has failed, largely because regulating things into existence doesn't tend to end well.

And again, all this will do is increase costs for EU firms, create inefficiencies and lead to poorer relationships between the EU and the global markets it needs access to. If the EU wants to try and play the big boy and take its ball home because it doesn't get its own way, it'd going to have great difficulty in playing on the same field as everyone else.

EU provides a framework for cooperation between European nations. Catalonian and (rest of) Spanish people can cooperate within this framework under terms they agree on.

From my own experience, Czech Republic and Slovakia split 26 years ago and relationships are better than ever and there's little economic consequence because of EU's shared market, unified regulations etc. Relationship would be definitely worse if we Czechs were somehow forcing Slovaks to stay.

&gt; France’s richest gain most from Emmanuel Macron’s tax reforms

&gt; Figures reinforce notion that president favours well-off and fuel calls for wealth levy

&gt; France’s richest 1 per cent remain by far the biggest winners from Emmanuel Macron’s tax policies, even after the emergency measures passed in December to appease anti-government protesters.

&gt; Top-earning households will see their disposable income rise 2.3 per cent as a result of changes taking effect in 2019, according to a new analysis published on Wednesday by the Institut des Politiques Publiques, a think-tank.

&gt; The gains are largely because of changes in tax on capital income. Reforms since the start of 2018 have had a bigger effect than the new changes for the very wealthiest. Disposable income rose 7.9 per cent for around 150,000 households and by an average of 17.5 per cent for the top 30,000 because of last year’s reforms.

&gt; The figures will reinforce the perception that the French president has favoured the rich, and is likely to fuel calls for him to restore or replace the wealth tax, which he scrapped shortly after taking office. Although taxation is on the agenda of an ongoing “national debate” intended to reduce tensions, Mr Macron has made it clear that reinstating the wealth tax is off limits — a bone of contention with protesters.

&gt; A package of tax cuts and handouts rushed through at the end of last year in an effort to defuse the protests has gone some way to redress the balance, targeting a few of the groups who have filled the ranks of the gilets jaunes movement.

&gt; The IPP said tax and benefit changes taking effect over 2018 and 2019 would benefit a large part of the population, with most employees gaining at the expense of wealthier pensioners.

&gt; However, some of the gains will only filter through this year, and most households will benefit to a much lesser degree. The IPP said changes taking effect in 2019 would boost disposable income by around 0.5 per cent for those with lower than average incomes, between the ninth and 24th earnings centile.

&gt; The average gain rises to around 1.7 per cent for middle income taxpayers — households in the 40th centile, or those with prior monthly disposable income of around €1,540 — and then dwindles, with most of the richest fifth of households seeing no benefit.

&gt; The poorest 10th of households are likely to lose out because many of them will not benefit from tax cuts for employees, and rely on welfare payments that are not rising in line with inflation.

&gt; The IPP said the emergency measures would benefit households across the income distribution, boosting disposable income by 0.8 per cent on average compared with the original budget plans.

&gt; The freeze on fuel taxes, combined with more generous fuel subsidies, will benefit poorer households most, as will front-loaded increases in payments to low wage workers. Middle-income pensioners win a reprieve from a tax increase previously pencilled in, while scrapping tax on overtime will largely benefit higher earners.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/c4j12r/french_parties_unite_in_call_for_referendum_on/es1791f/,araujoms,1561490636

If Scotland and England as countries had the same level of representation within Westminster, then that would have been disadvantageous to the English because Scotland only has a tenth of the population of England. That would have led to the situation you see in the US today with the electoral college where states with a tiny population like Wyoming and Montana are given an equal standing to a vote with tens of millions of people like California, meaning the votes of some people matter more than others.

2854,"&gt; Referendums were despenalized in Spain in 2005. There's no such thing as an illegal referendum. Its application? It can be illegal. But a referendum? Nope.

Indeed, as you say, the act of organizing an unauthorised referendum stopped being included in Spain's Criminal Code [in 2005](http://noticias.juridicas.com/base_datos/Penal/lo2-2005.html). However, decriminalisation and illegality are different concepts. Decriminalisation alone doesn't make an act *legal*; it only makes it free of prosecution for criminal offenses. It could still be illegal under civil law or, in this case, administrative law.

There are also other offenses that might be committed in such an act. In administrative and civil disputes, for example, justice courts can order one side not to act, with the warning that failure to obey the order can lead to a *crime* of disobedience. [That's the very reason](https://www.elperiodico.com/es/politica/20170313/texto-integro-fallo-sentencia-9n-5893943) Artur Mas was sentenced for, not the referendum itself.",,/r/europe/comments/c57yjj/fate_of_every_catalan_leader_since_1914/es180qb/,Misticsan,1561491102

2903,"Here José Antonio Martín Pallín, former magistrate of the Spanish Supreme Court, explains why Carles Puigdemont is not a fugitive from justice: https://youtu.be/9lpL6wqOdAc

When Puigdemont went into exile in Belgium, there was no process against him by the Spanish justice yet. So it's not true to say that he was escaping from Spanish justice. Then, when Spanish justice initiated a process against him, the Spanish judge issued an European Arrest Warrant in Belgium. That was rejected by Belgium courts as unfounded, and that the Spanish judge himself eventually withdrew. The Spanish justice tried again in Germany, but failed again and the Spanish judge also ended up withdrawing the arrest warrant.

Spanish justice ended up withdrawing all European and world arrest warrants, seeing that no country believed them. That is why Puigdemont and the rest of the Catalan political exiles living in Belgium, Scotland and Switzerland are now free.

With a well-executed arrest warrant, with real crimes (not like rebellion), they would not be free now.

3243,"Yeah i agree. In a real democratic state the people have to keep watch on the politicians non stop.

The problem is that people get sucked in their day to day life and are to tired/bored to keep track of what the politicians are doing.

This is where the non profit organisations jump in. 

They keep watch non stop and when something really bad hapends they sound the alarm, social media spreads it and people react.

For the small time isolated crime you have the judicial system (if it's independent).

That is how a democratic state would run in practice in my opinion.

Now the most important thing to change (especially in eastern europe) is the people's mentality. 

They vote based on the cult of personality rather than the cult of the principle.

So if they are convinced that someone is good and has their interests at heart is really hard to make them change their mind and risk ending up with Orban, Putin, Erdogan etc.

&gt; See Germany's SPD or Romanian PSD( how dumb you have to be to be kicked out of the EU social democrats, that level of stupid is beyond comprehension).

They are not dumb they are corrupt oportunists:

I will make a longer explanation to help you understand the situation fully.

In dec. 89 Ceaușescu was killed and it was replaced by the 2nd tier commies led by Ion Iliescu posing as social democrats.

It changed names and form during years and nowadays they are called PSD (Partidul Social Democrat).

They have won the general elections most of the times and had the goverment and president wombo combo (romania is a semi-presidential republic) for most of the time.

Problem is the romanian people in an overwhelming majority wanted the country to join EU and NATO so they had to negotiate getting in those or risk an actual revolution.

EU and NATO called for reforms that slowly started to make them (PSD) lose their grip on the situation and that combined with large numbers of romanians emigrating abroad and seeing how democracies look and function has started  to change the society and that lead to them losing the elections which ment other people  came to rule.

Those were corrupt too but they were amateurs when it came to the control of the state so institutions started to gain independence from the goverment and actually start to function.

More and more politicians started getting jail sentences including former PSD leader and prime minister Ilie Năstase.

So PSD started to rally their mayors to make the poor impressionable people (mostly from country side) vote in mass and that combined with the younger generation 0 interest in politics and  cities residents political apathy made them regain the goverment but not the presindency. 

So at this point PSD was controlling the parliament and the goverment but the presidency have not been theirs to 12y or so (2x terms Băsescu and 1x Iohannis).

One day a club in Bucharest caught fire and [alot of people died](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colectiv_nightclub_fire) because there was only one exit from it.

People started investigating how that was possible and it turned out that the club had all the permits from the fire department and the city hall because they paid for them without any proper inspections.

That made people mad because now people burned alive because of corruption so they took to the streets.

The PSD leader and prime minister at the time shocked everyone and resigned because of it leaving the corrupt PSD backrow exposed.

An technocrat goverment was appointed for 1 year (untill the general elections term was due) lead by Cioloș and they governed with a subdued parliament.

Meanwhile DNA (Direcția Națională Anticorupție) being fully free started doing helicopter dicks inside the ranks of the corrupt PSD and alot of them started going to jail for corruption charges.

When elections came PSD were pretty demoralised thinking Ponta passing the power to an actual democratic goverment boned them majorly and were thinking of ways to save their skin.

Ponta's only rival in PSD was a guy called Dragnea that just needed the party to re-gain the goverment or he would go to jail (he was already sentenced for election fraud: he had dead people in his county of Teleorman go vote).

So he went all out trying to rally the troops to get people to vote in the elections.

Because of the technocratic goverment of democratic normality of Cioloș the liberal parties were losing followers (why suport a political party when technocrats do a better job) and people did not go vote.

So when elections were held cities did not go to vote and the PSD mayors in the country side pushed everyone to go vote.

So PSD won with [45% of the casted votes.](https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alegeri_legislative_%C3%AEn_Rom%C3%A2nia,_2016)

The shock was immense. This was a Romania that thought was in the process of rounding up the last of the PSD corrupts and was getting praise from everywhere for the major democracy progress.

Imagine the PSD  mid levels going from waiting to get put into jail to being safe and protected behind Dragnea's new goverment.

Is why they were all so loyal and backed him up unconditionally.

So this Dragnea guy could not be prime minister himself since he has a conviction (the election fraud) so he started appointing muppet prime-ministers that were only tasked with getting the justice system under the politicat control of the goverment.

This  triggered massive protests that prevented them from doing that with ease.

A big help was the fact that the president was not one of them and was supporting an independent justice system.

Funny thing is the prime ministers Dragnea appointed have seen reason and began oposing these ordinances that would have subdued the justice system and ended up being removed by the same Dragnea with the help of the parliament: Sorin Grindeanu and Mihai Tudose were the ones.

So now there was a stand still in Romania, the justice system could not prosecute the PSD scum but the PSD scum could not subdue the justice system completely because of the massive protests and of the president of the republic.

By now the people realised that protests are nice and all but where it really matters is  on the election day.

Dragnea was unchallenged in the party because they all say him as the mesiah that saved them from jail so they started protecting his policies which ment even being kicked out of the EU social democrats.

His downfall started when PSD organised a referendum to modify the constitution and have the family be defined  by the union between a man and a woman.

PSD rallied their troops once more but even tho 92% ppl voted in favor it failed because the rest of the country boycotted the vote and they did not have the minimum requirement fullfilled.

So that kind of dented Dragnea's aura of invincible miracle worker in elections a bit.

Then the EU parliamentary elections came.

And people went to vote in mass. Vote opened at 7am i was done voting at 7:10 am :)

So Dragnea's PSD got a big loss from previous results and almost felled to 3rd place saved only because they (the PSD goverment) prevented the romanian diaspora from voting in mass.

[PSD went from 45% to 22.5%.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_European_Parliament_election_in_Romania)

Just because people went to vote.

So next day the last hearing on Dragnea's 2nd trial took place.

He was being charged with having 2 employees of the Children Assistance Social Service be paid for that from the state budged while they were going to work as secretaries in the PSD local headquarters.

The court did not receed his guilty verdict and so he ended up  being sentenced for 3.6 years with suspension of sentence.

But since he was already convicted for the election fraud case with suspension of sentece this 2nd one is automatically activated so Mr. Dragnea went to jail.


So now we have a decapitated PSD lead by a mupped of Dragnea trying to save the ship as much as they can untill the general elections come and we go mass vote again and put them out of their misery once and for all.",Romania,/r/europe/comments/c54kix/european_countries_vote_in_the_pace_on_russia/es01cah/,cipakui,1561462090

It always fascinated me to see how more advanced in the learning process they were, at the same age as us, when we visited. They are really not that bad. I think English is also closer to German than it is to French, so, to a certain extend, some things are easier to learn for them as they are for us... In France the education system kind of sucks as well. I did most of my learning by myself, by forcefully watching series / films in English, reading in English, listening to radio, playing video games in English, putting my phone in English, etc...

I saw a really interesting video once explaining why we suck so much in English. Parts of it is because we are really proud of our language. Another is that a _lot_ of people around the world, because of colonisation, speak French. And a last one, is that we are offered every service, or media or else, translated in French. So, what would be the use, right, if we don’t need it on an everyday basis ?

3623,"Man so I'm a big ol' white trash woman from the middle of rural Ontario. I'm just being truthful about this right out. I had no fucking clue what this style of bidet was when I first saw it. I had vaguely heard of like the kind that's in the toilet that has controls and whatnot that's real classy, but had never heard of like a standalone bidet like the one pictured above. 

&amp;#x200B;

A couple of years ago, I got the opportunity, via a study abroad program, to live in Italy for about a month and a week while earning a full credit toward my degree in history by studying the Italian renaissance and how it effected the landscape of the cities with a world renowned Renaissance historian. 

&amp;#x200B;

So needless to say, given my family's background, this is the first time anyone in my family (immediate or otherwise) had been in Italy for about 200 years? I am the first of my sisters to take a plane to go to a foreign country other than America, it's all so big an exciting. 

&amp;#x200B;

So we prepare and evertyhing the day comes, I'm at the airport like 5 hours in advance, we had to get up 3 hours in advance of when we wanted to arrive because I live quite the distance from the nearest airport. I didn't sleep on the flight 'cause of course 'm just too fucking excited. We touch down in Rome the next day I think like 9:30 AM at this point I've been awake for over 24 hours. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I knew Italy was gonna be hot, I don't think I ever realized how hot that could be. I just managed to get there in a year where there was an extreme drought in Tuscany. So there's me and a bunch of other unsuspecting sleep deprived Canadian assholes who just get absolutely blasted by a wall of fucking 50 MOTHERFUCKING DEGREE CELSIUS HUMID AS A FUCKIN WATERFALL air as we step out of the airport. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm like god, ok, alright, well it'll probably be cooler by the time we get there 'cause the city we're staying on is on a mountain, we're getting in kinda late, so it'll be cool night breezes by then. (I was wrong but more on that later)

&amp;#x200B;

We all pile onto the bus that's bringing us to Siena. For those who don't know Italy too too well Siena is an old Etruscan city that was influenced by goings on in the Renaissance but not to the degree that some of the others were due to historical stuff that you probably don't want a lecture on. It's also about a 2 and a half hour drive from Rome where our flight got off. 

&amp;#x200B;

So now imagine 2 and a half hours, on a bus, limited air conditioning, in 50 degree weather, after being awake for about 24 hours. To make matters worse I, being completely ignorant to how refreshments work on airplanes, was completely unaware that not only could i have brought a drink with me if I had bought it after security check, but also that I could request refreshments on the plane even if it wasn't a designated mealtime. So in the nearly 10 hour flight I had had maybe 3 6oz. glasses of water, and that was it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm tired, I'm sweaty, I'm dehydrated, I'm starting to get delirious. 

&amp;#x200B;

Being the persistent motherfucker that I am and not wanting to feel ungrateful for this amazing opportunity, tried to cheer myself up by thinking ""Oh well at least when we get there you can lay down and chill out and sleep and re-hydrate and just be alright."" 

&amp;#x200B;

Well we're going, we're going, we're going, we eventually reach the foot of the small mountain the city is on, we're going up, still going, a little twisty a little turny, and then right outside the city gates, we stop. We pile out. As we pile out, we're hit by the same fucking blast furnace like heat wall we were smacked with before. A few people start to despair. The local professor assigned to help our group get acclimatized then drops on us. ""Yeah because the city is so dang old"" (of course I'm paraphrasing here) ""we can't actually take the bus to the place and y'all are gonna have to walk with your luggage."" We're not happy at this point, but we're making due. We get through the gates to the city and in front of us is more fucking mountain. 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;thiskillstheman.jpg

&amp;#x200B;

We start trudging, the old streets not being kind to us with rolling luggage, the incline even less kind. We're straining, many of us dehydrated, tired, confused, near ass passing out, convinced that there is no god because he would not allow this to happen. This whole situation not at all helped out by the fact that I decided to wear flip flops for this part of the journey cause I figured running shoes would just make me overheat even more.  BUT WE DO IT, WE FINALLY MAKE IT TO THE GODDAMN COLLEGE WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE STAYING AT.  

&amp;#x200B;

We pile in, we get our room assignments, I manage to be one of the only people who snags a room by myself, I get in, I lay there on my unmade bed pass out for a couple of hours. I get up and realize not only am I thirst but everything hurts and I smell like a goddamn Barnum and Bailey Circus animal pen. My brain immediately goes to shower, shower is good shower is great, shower will fix all that ails me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I bumble around in darkness at this point to my bathroom, nearly get scared to death by a little lizard that's in the corner of the room, and start undressing. The shower itself is like fucking tiny. I'm an exceptionally wide person so that made situations even worse, but after discussing with a few of my peers the next day I realize that I was not alone in being perturbed by shower size. At that point, however, after the fucking Italian Oregon Trail I had just been on, I could only think of the sweet sweet relief that could come with the cascade of a hot shower. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I squeeze in, I turn on the water, it is just ever so slightly above room temp. ""Ok"" I think to myself, ""I'll just adjust it, nbd."" I turn the nob more hot... no hot water... I turn it up all the way... no hot water... i try it on the colder settings... no cold water... I'm stuck in a shower, too short for me, throwin sweat temperature water at me. I'm fuckin reeling. 

&amp;#x200B;

I get out, this bitch be desperate at this point. I try getting water from my sink, same room temp piss warm water. As I bumble around in the darkness, nekkid as the day I was born I stub my toe off this small porcelain fixture on the floor. It has a spigot and some water nobs... curious creation this. I turn the water on... colder than fucking ice. I swear to whatever fucking life giving force out there, some people experience the greatest day of their lives when they get married, or have kids, or get that promotion or whatever ur poison is. Mine was finding icy cold water in a bidet in Italy. 

&amp;#x200B;

Keep in mind at this time, I still don't know what this apparatus is. I have no clue. It's in close proximity to the toilet but like it's a small ass bathroom, everything is in close proximity to the toilet. Still being stupid tired and dehydrated and just confused and in pain from the walk and just overstimulated in every possible way I decide my best course of action for trying to quell the heat consuming me is to sit on the floor of this foreign bathroom and give myself a sponge bath with the frigid gift of this small, alien, porcelain contraption. 

&amp;#x200B;

And I did, I sat there, for probably an hour, with a travel sized bottle of body wash, late in at night, in the heat of the Tuscan summer, slumped down, nekkid, tired, just out of my goddamn gourd, soaping up and rinsing down with bidet water. There are many things that I will remember from that trip for the rest of my life... but giving myself a spongebath with a bidet... that comes first and foremost.",,/r/europe/comments/c4scc7/one_thing_americans_love_about_europe/erzf0cl/,Loud_lady2,1561433791

The swedes and the dutch are good at english because they made it a focal point of their policy, and it's vital for them since few people speak their language. Little internal market means you have to directly reach outside, and english is thus extremely important.

Meanwhile the french for example have way more people speaking their language and have access to way more ressource in their own language (also a bigger interior market)

You also have to consider the fact that learning a second language is not something integrated into the culture unlike the dutch for example which has always been a trading nation, and has incorporated the language learning in their culture.

3790,"&gt; , because unlike christians, muslims have never been through a reform or enlightenment period

Wrong. Have you ever studied the Golden age of Islam? The reformation and enlightenment happened in part because of Middle Eastern/Muslim societies.  Also ""Muslim"" is such a vague and vast term that such generalizations don't make sense. Also, your implication of the situation and complexities of geo-societal realities indicates a crippling simplification of the understanding of how human societies interact and what they believe. 

&gt;Islam had to be kept in check,

No, it doesn't. For someone for Turkey, you seem to espouse a lot of generalizations that are talking points of populists politicians. 

&gt;religious cults

?? I wouldn't call Sufism a cult. Ataturk didn't believe such a thing either. 

&gt;Religion is an important institution. A nation without religion cannot survive. Yet it is also very important to note that religion is a link between Allah and the individual believer. The brokerage of the pious cannot be permitted. Those who use religion for their own benefit are detestable. We are against such a situation and will not allow it. Those who use religion in such a manner have fooled our people; it is against just such people that we have fought and will continue to fight. Know that whatever conforms to reason, logic, and the advantages and needs of our people conforms equally to Islam. If our religion did not conform to reason and logic, it would not be the perfect religion, the final religion.
As quoted in Kemalizm, Laiklik ve Demokrasi [Kemalism, Laicism and Democracy] (1994) by Ahmet Taner Kışlalı

&gt; ignorancy and bigotry were very dominant,

Hardly. Islam served as a unifying factor for much of the Ottoman Empire and the Turkish Republic. In fact, one could claim it was the only unifying factor and basis of modern Turkish culture. Turkish nationalism was the main factor in bigotry and demise of the Ottoman Empire. 

&gt; majority of our people were illiterate.

This is true but it had nothing to do with Islam. Most nations at that time were majority illiterate. You could go to China and Japan during the 1900s and say the same thing but that isn't the result of the Chinese and Japanese following Buddhism.

Surely all your ideals are the ""correct"" ones, and the need for a vote is redundant.

Well, democracy requires respect because it doesn't revolve around you individually, it revolves around the collective opinions of those participating. There may be times when an idea you don't agree with gets voted for by a majority, but that doesn't make them inherently wrong, it just means you can't get what you want because not everyone agrees with you.

3807,"Telegram went through a independent security audit which found no issues.

They don't use end-to-end encryption by default true, but if you know how to use it, it's a perfectly secure messenger

&gt;he Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) listed Telegram on its ""Secure Messaging Scorecard"" in February 2015. Telegram's default chat function received a score of 4 out of 7 points on the scorecard. It received points for having communications encrypted in transit, having its code open to independent review, having the security design properly documented, and having completed a recent independent security audit. Telegram's default chat function missed points because the communications were not encrypted with keys the provider didn't have access to, users could not verify contacts' identities, and past messages were not secure if the encryption keys were stolen. Telegram's optional secret chat function, which provides end-to-end encryption, received a score of 7 out of 7 points on the scorecard.[118] The EFF said that the results ""should not be read as endorsements of individual tools or guarantees of their security"", and that they were merely indications that the projects were ""on the right track"".[118]

Moreover it offered 200 000$ and 300 000$ to anyone who could read their encrypted messages and nobody found a way.

&gt;Telegram has organized two cryptography contests to challenge its own security. Third parties were asked to break the service's cryptography and disclose the information contained within a secret chat between two computer-controlled users. A reward of respectively US$200,000 and US$300,000 was offered. Both of these contests expired with no winners.

In short if you know how to use it, Telegram is secure. 

If you don't know how to be responsible, the app doesn't matter, the encryption doesn't matter, no matter how foolproof your system is, if you're irresponsible and know nothing of it's use, you might as well have no security.

It's not the encryption protocols or decryption keys that are the main security risks. It's people and it'll always be people.",🇮🇱 Израел 🇮🇱,/r/europe/comments/c0rxmq/european_countries_requiring_registration_of/eryvow6/,ahwhatever11,1561418711

In fact, new found republic had to suppress several uprisings because of our secularisation process. 

M.Kemal Ataturk thought it was better to keep the religious institutions under state authority, so that religious cults wouldn't have influence on people and eventually die out, since all the mosques werre funded by the government, as well as imam appointments, they would be able to prevent dangerous radical ideas from spreading. That worked out for a while, but like I said, Islam has never gone through a reform and those islamist groups never perished, they just went underground and waited till the right moment, which was 80's coup.

3903,"Thanks for the link. :) It helps me imagine things better in perspective. It appeas to be a really fast responding plant and helps avoid others adjusting their power output. Steam turbines are the slowest (as water needs to be heated/cooled before anything will happen) and power plants using those can take hours to start even from a hot condition, gas turbines are faster (startup times in minutes) but still have inertia and experience thermal stress (can be damaged by running up or down too quickly)... this thing appears to respond in seconds and lets other plants adjust slower, causing far less wear and tear. :)

The capacity ain't big, though... the pumped hydro plant in Kruonis, Lithuania (that I mentioned somewhere below) has 10 GWh of capacity, this one has 0.129 GWh.

Compare the French Fifth Republic to the disastrous Fourth Republic.

The same way that having 5 parties in parliament forces politicians to work together more often and compromise.

Just like how when you go through an airport with 1kg of cocaine on your body, they will take it off you.  In that instance, it's ok for the government to be 'taking private property'.

The argument is that people who use the ""bird"" argument against windmills are most likely insincere, because they don't care about bird windmills aren't involved.

As for the actual argument, bird casualties can be minimized if pay attention to migratory routes. And that definitely should be included in the permission procedure, that's why it exists.

&gt;The only places in my country where wind turbines would make any economic sense are in protected landscape/nature reserves areas. The idea of paving them over with wind turbines is perverse. People go there to enjoy the last bits of relatively unspoilt landscapes.

That's obviously bullshit, more densely populated countries find space for them, surely you can manage.

The economic centers of the Eastern Slavs were constantly changing. There was a period of Kiev, then there was Novgorod, and then there was Moscow, by the way, Moscow is not a Russian name, and another ethnic group lived there.

Only Russia appeared in the 12th century, and by the way from Kiev, and then when the country united into one whole, they began to call themselves Rus, and the Slavic tribes were Russians.

&gt; Nevertheless, this decision got forced through on condition that West would build a new nuclear power plant in Lithuania. 

This is not true at all. The EU never gave any promises to finance new nuclear power plant. EU agreed to finance decomissioninng costs, and that's it. Moreover, majority of citizens voted on referendum against building new nuclear power plant.

&gt; LNG

Your whole diatribe about Lithuanian LNG is total BS. For the last 25 years, we, in Lithuania, have suffered the most from complete reliance on Russian gas. Since we had absolutely no alternative, we literally paid the highest price for natural gas in Europe. After the LNG terminal was completed, almost the next day, Russian Gazprom reduced the price for Lithuanian consumers by 20%, and since then we receive gas from Russian providers cheaper than in many other EU states. And this is only the economic benefit of this project. The increased competition on the Baltic gas market, and security of gas supply is arguably even more important for us. [[1]](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/28/business/energy-environment/lithuania-offers-example-of-how-to-break-russias-grip-on-energy.html)

*Lithuanian officials say they had already pushed Russia into bargaining — something it has long resisted — when Gazprom cut its gas prices by about 20 percent in May.*

*“Consumers are already feeling lower prices of gas” as “a natural outcome of our terminal construction,” Rokas Masiulis, the Lithuanian energy minister, told reporters on Monday. The price that Lithuania was paying for liquefied natural gas was in “a very similar range” to the lower Gazprom price, he said.*

&gt; Now that power plant is practically complete, all people of good had joined forces together to ensure that spread of AUTHORITARIANISM from the East will not happen.

This is such BS propaganda. Lithuania is against Belarus nuclear plant project because it was build near our capital city. Lithuania is against this project because Belarus has violated Ecpoo convention. [[2]](https://belsat.eu/en/news/why-astravets-npp-so-close-to-vilnius-belarus-violated-espoo-convention-parties/)

*On February 7, the Meeting of the Parties to the Espoo Convention in Geneva decided that Belarus had violated the Espoo Convention in choosing a construction site for its nuclear power plant. According to them, Belarus failed to provide the Committee with the information regarding the justification of the selection of the Astravets site over the alternative sites. According to the top official, it is regrettable that Belarus ignores the international experts’ findings in order to follow the construction plan. The complaint that the Convention was violated in carrying out the environmental impact assessment of the Astravets NPP was lodged by Lithuania in 2011. 30 of 36 participants backed Lithuania’s stance at Thursday’s session.*",,/r/europe/comments/c4jkrh/baltic_countries_and_eu_confirm_plan_to/erxen9u/,Sutartine,1561382625

&gt; to provide an alternative method, and thus a guarantee when Russia starts to use gas exports for political meddling.

Is there some basis to this statement? I mean, beyond ""anyone who disagrees with this is a Russian spy""? 

I don't remember Kremlin playing with on/off switch to further political goals. It is always the opposite: political methods are used to achieve economic goals. I.e. not spending money on politics, but using politics to earn money.

So I'm pretty sure Kremlin will not be using gas to manipulate Baltics, but it can - and will - manipulate Baltics (and whoever necessary) to make them use Russia's gas. Just like every other nation does.

* **NB:** I hope nobody actually believes that Huawei is being harassed because people at the top are trying to defend privacy of general public.

&gt;&gt; Baltics are being forcibly disconnected from the post-Soviet energy grid.

&gt; forcibly?

Does the population have a say in this matter? I'm pretty sure there will be no referendums, no choice but to submit to the decision that was already made. Nevertheless, it will be population that will be affected the most.

Those council sessions wasn't being published live before. So practically AKP forced to co-operate with CHP-tied mayors.

4384,"for now he's just the mayor of istanbul, and all his promises &amp; policies have been about Istanbul, as they should be. So, making direct comparisons about his and Erdogans goals don't make sense for now.

What he has said about Istanbul was that, it's very corrupt at the moment, and it is going to need some time fixing.

he has been the mayor of istanbul between april 1-20, and he has halved the monthly cost of 'istanbulkart', a card used for public transport. he had promised free water to families that have an income under a certain amount, and he has done it. many more examples, and all have been done in just 19 days.

What Erdogan has been saying and doing to Turkey for years is obvious as you stated. He keeps moving in a muslim centric direction. Cant keep the economy stable. There are some high schools in Turkey with the suffix 'Anatolian High School', which are almost all in the upper 50% of Turkey's education system in terms of success.  He keeps closing thesr or turns them into religion centric schools. Tries to delete Atatürk secularism &amp; Kemalism from many history books and tries to replace it with religion &amp; its derivatives.

But most importantly, a MASSIVE AMOUNT of people that are connecred to Erdogan are INCREDIBLY CORRUPT. With evidence!! and nothing has been done to these people. the cases of rape, bombings, terror are dismissed in the parliament. Suggestion to investigate stuff like

corrupt government officials

the soma mine disaster

the ankara bombing

kurdish deaths

and many more have been rejected by AKP officials in the parliament, which are in essence selected by Erdogan. He's a non secular, non Kemalist piece of shit with no respect to womens or minorities rights.

Ekrem Imamoglu has so far shown himself to be more secular, and there's seriously no trace of corruption in the guy. Atm he's currently like an angel to Turks that are more on the left side of the spectrum. And even if he wasn't, 

1) He's still definitely better than the previous mayor, Binali Yıldırım for Istanbul.

2) Even if we accept him as the lesser of two evils with erdogan, it's a difference between -1.000 and -2. If Erdogan is Satan himself, Ekrem is like a guy who litters the street with a cigarette butt.

All cynicism is appreciated, but winning a single election after all these years as young adult who lives in Istanbul is incredibly refreshing and hope-injecting. 

finishing this with the campaign slogans of imamoglu:

As long as there's Imamoglu, there's hope!

You are right about the fission waste though. But on the short term it still is cheaper. Of course that doesn't take into account people messing about and blowing the reactor because of Human error. Not that it happened in the USSR of course.

Most of their (not specifically Petrozavodsk, but Northern cities in general) predecessors were resettled forcibly by the Tsarist / Soviet regime for land development. So, they aren't allowed to leave. 


Later, such cities became closed centers, where weapons companies, strategic factories, nuclear shipyards, etc. were concentrated.

In such cities there was a special supply (my hometown (shipyard for nuclear submarines) constantly had cakes, Georgian wines, rare fruits, while in 50km from us - in the central city of the region (500k + population, regular city) - such delicacies were available only for holidays), high salaries, preferential trips to sanatorium, benefits for a bunch of other things. And most of these benefits survived after the collapse of the USSR

So, people start to move in such cities. 

In addition, move to another city, especially the southern one, is very difficult from a cultural point of view.

Moving from Murmansk or Arkhangelsk to Moscow is comparable to moving from Helsinki to Rome. In the sense of degree of cultural shock.

4516,"That's what most people think, but it's not true. Statistics show that there is no meaningful vote transfer between CHP and AKP last election, difference is less than 5000. It is estimated just a bit higher in the new election but far from being the decisive factor.

 The story of the first election is: Kurds voted for CHP en masse with HDP's decision, some AKP voters didn't vote as a protest to their own party which didn't have to do with anything Imamoglu did, but rather corruption and lavish lifestyles of AKP executives + the economic crisis. What Imamoglu had to do was do not alienate the Kurds + bring your own supporters to vote. He did that succesfully, although some CHP voters didn't vote in the last elections either due to conservative tendencies of Imamoglu which limited the difference.

In the new election, even more AKP voters refused to vote, almost every single CHP voters came to the polls and same for HDP supporting Kurds. Nobody really changed their decisions except some nationalists angry with the Ocalan shenanigans AKP tried to pull. Ince could've done the same. HDP voters voted for their own candidate in the presidential elections but Ince had lots of sympathy with them since he voted against his own party decision when CHP joined AKP in lifting HDP MP's immunities. The results were due to current conjuncture, not personal success.

Imamoglu is fine, he ran a good campaign and I beliece he will make a good mayor for Istanbul. His main advantage over Ince is that he refused to accept the results when AKP declated they won before the polls closed which made a huge difference and will always be a huge gold star in his political career and will always be a negative for Ince. He is however not a brand new political superstar getting support beyond party lines and winning the hearts of AKP voting consrvatives, this part is wishful thinking on CHP side but every single election statistic rejects the idea.

We have seen several times that the road to success for CHP isn't to pander to the conservatives. It is to unite republican CHP voters, secular nationalists and Kurds under the same banner against AKP. When they manage to do that, they win. Any other scenario loses.

And after two years, people are seeing mostly right-wing policies put into place, with tax cut on the top 1%, less worker protections, etc...

Let's keep in mind that over 3.6 million people still voted for his candidate and he'd beat Ekrem Imamoglu in a race for presidency. Comparing with the earlier results, I believe it would be a tight race today but Erdoğan would secure another term in the second round with over %52 of the votes.

Long story short, we still have too many conservative people living in neo-Ottoman dreams. AKP and Erdoğan is bound to fall sooner than later but this is only because people are tired of the current government. Once a new, moderate centre-right party is founded, people will flock to vote for them. Turkey has almost always been conservative and it will need at least two decades before we might even think about a possible change. Thanks to Erdoğan destroying education as well, there are lots of young neo-Ottoman schizos, too. 

I'm extremely happy that my country is somehow showing signs of life but let's not get too excited - this is only the beginning and I am not sure if it will lead to a change for the better. The system has to change. Otherwise, we'll have new Erdoğans coming up. Simply put, Turkish people neither trust nor want Europe. Unless this perception somehow changes, be it thanks to a better education or something else, nothing in terms of cooperation with the EU will ever change.

4689,"* The Conservative party leadership. Tory MPs voted in multiple rounds, with [Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt getting through](https://news.sky.com/story/tory-leadership-can-jeremy-hunt-possibly-beat-boris-johnson-11746392). They will now travel the country campaigning and appearing in debates while Conservative party members (around 160,000) vote on who they would like as their new leader, and consequently, the new Prime Minister of the UK. The result will be announced in the week beginning 22nd July.

* A Conservative minister, Mark Field, was suspended from the government after he grabbed a protester at the Mansion House dinner (an event where the Chancellor makes a speech about the economy). Greenpeace protesters managed to get into the ballroom and Field shoved a female protester against a column, then grabbed her by the neck and marched her outside. Police are investigating if there's cause for any charges. Footage of [the incident is here,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeVS19oaSKw) but be warned, it's not comfortable viewing.

* A different Conservative MP has [lost his seat as a result of a petition](https://www.itv.com/news/wales/2019-06-21/welsh-mp-loses-seat-over-expenses-claims/). Chris Davies, an MP for Brecon and Radnorshire in Wales, was convicted over filing fake expenses claims. As a result of the conviction, a petition was automatically opened in his constituency for anyone to sign and have him sacked. Almost 20% of the people in that constituency signed the petition and removed him as MP. (The minimum needed is 10%). There will now be a by-election to elect a new MP, which will probably happen after the new Prime Minister comes to power.

* [Police were called to the home in which Boris Johnson and his partner](https://www.itv.com/news/2019-06-21/police-called-to-boris-johnsons-home-after-concerns-raised-for-neighbour/) live after neighbours heard loud arguments, screaming and banging. No arrests were made and no charges have been filed, but considering this involves the potential new prime minister, many questions are being asked. [Pressure is mounting on Johnson to explain what happened](https://www.itv.com/news/2019-06-23/johnson-under-pressure-to-discuss-police-incident-after-dodging-row-questions/) while the right-wing press is suggesting this is some sort of leftist plot and is questioning why the police were called at all.

* A man who knocked a woman down on his bike has been [ordered to pay roughly £100,000.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/21/cyclist-crashed-into-woman-mobile-phone-pay-compensation-london) The woman stepped into the road while looking at her phone with the traffic lights on green for traffic, but the judge has found that both people were equally to blame as the cyclist should have been prepared for 'unexpected behaviour'.

&gt; From a relatively young age Icelandic children are told the story of Grýla, the ogress living in the Icelandic mountains. She is a dreadful character, described as part troll and part animal and the mother of 13 precocious boys (the Yule Lads). Grýla lives in the mountains with her third husband, her thirteen children and a black cat. Every Christmas, Grýla and her sons come down from the mountains: Grýla in search of naughty children to boil in her cauldron and the boys in search of mischief. She can only capture children who misbehave but those who repent must be released.

&gt;Icelandic children place a shoe in their bedroom window each evening in the 13 days before Christmas.

4766,"&gt;the last of the native nobility had to flee in the 17th century. 

**That's false!** 

There was many native-Irish landlords such as the Mac Dermots of Coolvin, the O'Connors of Connacht, Mac Murrough Kavanaghs of Leinster and McGillicuddy's of the Reeks who were prosperous until Independence and beyond. 

These out of economic necessity converted to the Church of Ireland to avoid the worse of the Penal Laws at the time including the Popery Act 1704 which forced Catholics to subdivide their land on inheritance. 

The ""Foreign Aristocracy"" which you mention are those who arrived during colonisation and took lands as part of the Plantations such as the Brabazons of Wicklow, Beresfords of Waterford, Conynghams of Slane and Pakenham Of Longford. These were raised to titles of Earl of Meath, Marquess of Waterford, Marquess Conyngham and Earl of Longford respectfully.

However, if you interview these people now (and they have been) all of them would consider themselves Irish and it is by no fault of their own that they have - by history or birth - inherited a British title! 

Even those native-Irish whose ancestors received British titles such as the current Baron Inchiquin can trace their linage back to the 10th century in Ireland.

For/against uranium does have merits on both sides, we just need less analogies and more real terms, e.g. waste sites need to be safe (cost), secure (cost, but creates jobs), geologically or structurally stable (cost, job creation), and relativity to alternatives discussed, e.g. land damage/mountainous geography required/cost/job/what happens when it goes wrong requirements for water energy storage for renewable versus the same for nuclear waste, or a mixed energy sector, or the unthinkable alternatives, no power or no *reliable* power or no large scale *industrial* power.",,/r/europe/comments/c3ulbt/right_now_thousands_of_climate_activists_from_all/erwh2lo/,CosmicScientist,1561343387

5098,"&gt;Holocaust historian Efraim Zuroff from the Jerusalem-based Simon Wiesenthal Centre called upon Croatian political leaders on Wednesday to reject MEP Ruza Tomasic’s recent statements of sympathy for the Ustasa movement.

&gt;Zuroff alleged that Tomasic was attempting to whitewash the large-scale atrocities committed by the Ustasa and the WWII-era Independent State of Croatia, the NDH.

&gt;“Ruza Tomasic is considered by many Croatians to be an excellent MEP with impressive achievements in her previous terms on behalf of Croatia. It might have been possible to overlook her activities on behalf of Croatian extremists, if she had sincerely renounced fascism and the genodical policies of the NDH,” Zuroff said.

&gt;“Since that is not the case, however, and she still expresses support for a movement which should be universally condemned, we urge Croatian leaders to unequivocally distance themselves from the dangerous and repulsive views of MEP Ruza Tomasic,” he added.

&gt;On Friday, Novosti, a weekly newspaper for the Croatian Serb ethnic minority, revealed that Tomasic had published poems glorifying Ustasa and NDH leader Ante Pavelic, and had been photographed wearing an Ustasa uniform while living in Canada in the 1970s and 1980s.

&gt;Asked to comment, Tomasic said that she still sympathises with the Ustasa movement, but differentiated between what she called “regular Ustasa” and those who committed crimes after 1941, when they came to power in Croatia.


&gt;“The Ustasa movement is one thing, and the NDH is another… Many crimes were committed during WWII. During those four years, the NDH separated itself from what the Ustasa movement represented,” Tomasic told Novosti.

&gt;She said that anyone who committed crimes should be condemned, but added that she doesn’t denounce “the regular Ustasa who fought for their homeland”.

&gt;Tomasic confirmed those statements to other local media. On Friday, she also told right-wing website Direktno that the photo of her wearing Ustasa uniform published in Novosti was genuine.

&gt;At the recent European Parliament elections, Tomasic’s newly-formed Croatian Sovereignist coalition won 8.52 per cent of the votes, giving her another mandate. In 2013, she was a candidate of the now-governing Croatian Democratic Union, HDZ.

&gt;Under the rule of the NDH, a WWII fascist puppet state of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy, over 30,000 of around 40,000 Jews who were living on the its territory were killed.

&gt;At the Jasenovac concentration camp, the Ustasa murdered 13,116 Jews, along with 47,627 Serbs, 16,173 Roma and 6,229 victims from other nationalities, according to a confirmed list of victims’ names.",Serbia,/r/europe/comments/c4essf/croatian_mep_condemned_for_repulsive_ustasa/erw5z6j/,ChieftainBumblebee,1561334196

&gt;I haven't said that. I even gave you example of why nuclear did not happen. 
&gt; I didn't even suggest it 

I didn't say you did you fuckwit, I clearly stated I was replying to the posts made by the original person (nudis_verbis) posts who stated that - look, it's here in fucking plain English:

&gt;All I said was that **there is an alternative to nudis_verbis' nonsense argument that the only alternative to coal is to have no power. **

&gt;Poland does, and as I said Polish and UK energy industry are totally different . Comparing to other countries UK mines were basically shut down. When I say this its obviously not in split second but fairly quick. You already had nuclear powerplants at the time, Poland does not even now.

UK did not have nuclear power in the national grid until 1956 (and even that, Calder Hall, was a weapons production facility), around the time when coal production first started to drop

&gt;Germany did not, its still bigger coal burner than Poland 

Germany has been developing green over the last 16 years, their solar and wind in particular have grown from 12 GW (wind) and 0.3 GW (solar) in 2002 to 52.7 GW (wind) and 45.3 GW (solar) in that time. It's not ideal but their gas burning has also gone up (from 20.3 GW to 29.6GW) - gas is cleaner than coal. They have also expanded offshore wind from nothing to 5.9GW in about 9 years (2009-2018), biomass from 1.3 to 7.7, hydro 4.9 to 5.5. Your argument is a distraction tactic to disguise the fact you're wrong. Yes Germany burns more coal, they're a more advanced industrial nation - and they're still doing something about it to make the country greener despite their ludicrous decision to close down nuclear

&gt;Coal mining does not cause polution, burning coal does.
You still comparing UK coal mining to Polish coal mining instead of comparing both countries power supply. POLAND DOES NOT HAVE A CHOICE right now, UK does.
Poland does not burn coal because its pretty. 

Again, arguing against something I didn't say. UK mined coal for power. I didn't say Poland has to do it RIGHT THIS VERY SECOND, I said they can start making a change.

&gt;What are the solutions ? Most are wishful thinking, combination of gas, inefficient in Poland solar or wind. Whenever its possible it is slowly implemented. The main difference is, most other countries use nuclear power. Try remove that and you will be at 50% energy deficit. 

That's beyond retarded, you're literally denying the facts of science. Scotland in the UK has fucking solar power and they have about 3 days sun a year, it's a national joke that their summer lasts about a day and they still have an industry of solar panels producing hot water and have since the 1970s! The EU is giving you money to develop alternative fuel sources and reduce coal usage, free fucking money.

Fuck me you're a fucking retard, you don't have clue what you're talking about, you argue about stuff I didn't say, misinterpret points I made even though I clearly stated them, you need to go back to school and start again.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/c3tx2h/greenpeace_has_displayed_polish_prime_ministers/ervu8of/,Tuarangi,1561325179

5146,"Ok, gloves off for this one. Your comment is full of shit, and I hope I can make you understand why by the end of it:


Expensive? In what context do you use that word? To be clear, I am not talking about solutions within the framework of a profit oriented capitalist market economy, and neither are these activists. And don't tell me about price and how many the lack of money would kill and at the same time suggesting we should go on with business as usual. One example that completely disproves your viewpoint: the consumption of meat requires large amount of our agricultural output to be fed to livestock which is an enormous waste of calories, as the grain, maze, and soy could be eaten by humans themselves. Right now two thirds of the poulation are malnourished, 900 millions poeple go to bed on an empty stomach, mal-nutrition being the biggest killer globally right now, and we have 1.5 times the amount of food needed to feed everybody globally - meanwhile our agriculture destroys the soils and will render them unusable within a few decades. Instead we could stop the production of meat which would bump up the figure of people being fed with an unchanged agriculture to 2.5 times of what is needed to feed everybody. That gives plenty of room to degrow agriculture AND have a safety margin for when harvests fail globally. And it doesn't even cost money, however the affected industries (their shareholders and owners, I mean) would make less profits. And that is the name of the game, isn't it? When you say ""too expensive"", I ask ""for whom?"". Not for the starving two fucking thirds of this world. And who in the world would be killed? MILLIONS would be SAVED. And that isn't even factoring in the agriculural industries' contriution to climate change and environmental destruction.

The resources are already there, we need to DE-GROW (doesn't take more money but the opposite), not continue (which is 2-4% growth per year). And by the way, climate change was an issue since the 1960 and we had PLENTY of time to achieve the 2 degree goal, even with means available back then. But no political power was behind it, because there is no profits in stopping global warming. And finally, I will not take an institution like the Nobel prize as an authority on anything for several reasons: We have a process that grants credibility to scientific ideas and that discusses them (which is still bad but better than relying on big prizes) and that is peer reviewed publications. A Nobel prize gives nobody's ideas legitimacy. Look at Watson who won the prize for finding the DNA's double helix structure. He should be a genious when it comes to genetics but he's also a racist and mysogenist piece of shit, and even his ""dogma"" has been dis-proven. Or Konrad Lorenz, who also won a Nobel prize in medicine and was also an actual Nazi, Hitler fan, and mind behind fascist race sciences. And in economics it is even more ridiculous, because it isn't an actual Nobel prize. The Nobel prize in economics was developed to give credibility to classical economic theory, and named to hijack the PR power that comes with the original Nobel prices, so that people like you could uphold these entire ideology behind it while thinking ""they must have it right, after all they are Nobel prize laureates"".

Go and read ""The Divide"" by Jason Hickel (who is a fellow of the Royal Society for Arts, you seem to care about these sorts of things). It will clear up your misconceptions.",Earth,/r/europe/comments/c3ulbt/right_now_thousands_of_climate_activists_from_all/ervunfe/,1_048596,1561325470

5150,"1 Social democrats screwed themselves repeatedly in past years.
2. Social democrats should have been bankrupted for some time already. They have huge debts.
3. Social democrats tried to follow other leftish parties in Europe by trying to go for the New Left (i.e., from conservative pro-worker left, to progressive left aiming at young educated people in big towns with, one could argue, too much free time). However, ""New Left"" is already quite divided among several parties in CZ, we have strong Pirates, we have our own Greens and we have progressive center-to-right TOP09. Each of them aims at slightly different segment of young progressive big city population. Thus, social democrats alienated their original vote base and failed to attract a new voter base.

4. Social democrats like to practice political assassination. On their own members. Social democrats are an internally fractured party with many cliques. They are willing to politically destroy their internal enemies even if this means that the party as a whole would get less votes. This further hampered the project.

5. After all this, the voters of social democrats didn't have much choice, the only valid objects to vote is ANO, SPD and maybe communists. Who else?

Czech parties:
ČSSD -- social democrats, classical old conservative left with 100 year history.
ODS -- ideological (while not always political) opponent of ČSSD, proponents of capitalism and economic right, while still being relatively socially conservative.
KDU-ČSL -- Christian party, weak voterbase as Czechs are not really religious and even if they are, they usually do not vote according to their religion, they often played a kingmaker in Czech politics. Relatively socially conservative.
KSČM -- Communist party. Political friend on the local municipal level, political enemy on country level.
TOP09 -- Relatively new member that emerged from socially and the economically progressive wing of KDU-ČSL.
Pirates -- socially and economically progressive, often criticizing the technological aspects of government. Politically new with a lot of young people, but they seem to be a well established party. They attracted a lot of new-left activists, but also some politically conservative people who appreciate the technological aspects (e.g., my 60 years old father)
Starostové a nezávislí -- (Mayors and Independent) Mayors of smaller towns, socially conservative, economically somewhere in between. Often partnered with KDU-ČSL (due to similar voter-base), partially similar voter-base to ČSSD.
Greens -- Greens like everywhere else. Socially progressive, economically uneducated. Czech Greens have an interesting history. Originally they started as centrish party with a strong ecological views and immediately gained a lot of votes (about 10%?) and gained position similar to KDU-ČSL, a kingmaker. However, the leadership wasn't able to stabilize this success and in fact turned to be quite incompetent (one of the main party leaders ""Katka Au-Au"" becaume ""famous"" just because she was allegedly ""beaten on demonstration"", it went downhill when she didn't even know what the ""biomass"" she was so vehemently propagating was). Current Green leadership is however the traditional activists type and thus won't ever get enough votes in CR (I am not even sure if they are currently in government).

And now the two highly populist party:
SPD -- project of Tomio Okamura, half-Czech half-Japanese, nationalist populist party, socially conservative, politically surprisingly progressive (a lot of ""direct democracy"" thins, similar to Pirates), but with a strong authoritative tendencies. Not really internally democratic. Famous for baning everyone who disagree with them on facebook. Tomio Okamura made a similar party before and in turned out to be just a project to make money. Probably the same will happen with SPD.

ANO -- Populist economically center, socially conservative, one-man party of Andrej Babiš, Slovak imperialist who famously said ""I am the Senate"". Just kidding. Almost. He is pro-EU with an economically rational politics with a populist side, which means that he listen to popular trends and modify what he says according to that (like with immigrant crisis, he was happy that uneducated low-paid workers will come, but when he heard that people don't like it, he was suddenly against it). His party is not democratic at all and he politically assasinate anyone who seems to be capable of standing against him. Or even too good to take some of his spotlight. If the party was democratic and he didn't steal, it wouldn't be so bad.

Now, I hope I have showed you why are people formerly from ČSSD voting for ANO. There isn't really any other subject to give votes. No one else is targetting for big-city socially conservative and economically left or at least center. Mabye Starostové a Nezávislí, but they are relatively new to national politics as an independent subject (previously they were part of TOP09/KDU-ČSL) and as party with a heavy christian tint and connection to TOP and KDU, people are afraid to vote them. The most publicity they got was when they were deciding if they want to go to elections together with KDU-ČSL or as an independent subject and that does not give them much trust.",,/r/europe/comments/c46qdg/250_thousand_protest_in_prague_czech_republic/ervupic/,Unicorn_Colombo,1561325511

You can see how rescues went closer and closer to the Libyan coast. The EU has this to say about it:

&gt;On the other hand, it has fundamentally changed the business model of people smugglers by creating a new opportunity structure that makes it cheaper (but no less risky) to reach EU territory.  
&gt;  
&gt;**As recently as 2014, people smugglers were still mainly making use of larger vessels** – wooden boats, fishing vessels or decommissioned commercial vessels – that they manned themselves and that were, for the most part, able to reach Italian shores without having to rely on rescue operations. **Since 2016, however, smugglers have switched to mainly placing people on cheap and completely unseaworthy inflatable dinghies that have no prospect of ever reaching the Italian shores**. The smugglers themselves no longer embark on these boats, but leave it to those on board to navigate from the Libyan coast to a place where they can call for help via satellite phones and wait to be picked up.  
&gt;  
&gt;In practice, this means that **the majority of irregular immigrants and refugees arriving in Italy are now actually being transported most of the way on vessels provided by European navies, coast guards and NGOs – thereby facilitating the work of the smugglers.** At the same time, the number of smugglers arrested during SAR operations is, unsurprisingly, declining.  
&gt;  
&gt;**This change in dynamics partly explains why irregular flows were actually much smaller prior to the start of highly-publicised, large-scale maritime surveillance operations** (Figure 1), whether these were led by Italy (Mare Nostrum, Mare Sicuro), by NGOs or organised as joint European operations (Frontex/Triton and EUNavFor/Sophia).  
&gt;  
&gt;The fact that such unseaworthy dinghies now account for 70% of all boats leaving the Libyan coast (Figure 8) also **explains why the number of people dead or missing is still high and rising despite rescue efforts moving ever closer to the Libyan coast.** And, in the absence of experienced navigators on board, casualties caused by navigation errors and incompetence have been growing.  
&gt;  
&gt;Most casualties now take place between Western Libya and Malta (Figure 9).  
&gt;  
&gt; [https://ec.europa.eu/epsc/publications/strategic-notes/irregular-migration-central-mediterranean\_en](https://ec.europa.eu/epsc/publications/strategic-notes/irregular-migration-central-mediterranean_en) 

So you had these European ships going closer and closer to the Libyan coast, creating the opportunity for smugglers to throw people in smaller and cheaper boats, without themselves or their people even around anymore. They bring people a bit into the sea, then call out a rescue signal, make the boat start to sink and they leave themselves back to Libya to repeat the cycle. NGOs want to continue this cycle of suffering.",,/r/europe/comments/c49t1i/europes_apathy_toward_humanitarian_rescue/ervur4w/,cissoniuss,1561325544
5156,"&gt;&gt;Non-violent direct action has a history in for example independence of Baltic States

&gt;That happened exclusively because the USSR was in the process of falling apart due to appalling mistakes by its leadership.

What sped up the falling apart was the non-violent revolutions.

&gt;With regards to climate change, the time when public attention needed to be directed towards the topic is far in the past - everyone but the Americans is fully aware of the terrible situation we're facing.

You know the saying: the best time to act was 20 years ago, the second best time to act is now.

It's not just about being aware, it's about *mobilizing people* too. To transform that awareness to action.

&gt;Push that through, by...

&gt;&gt;Like, in Germany the Green party is polling very high, and how I've heard is that the inaction of larger parties on climate change has pushed people to support Greens.

&gt;...getting these guys into government or forcing the other parties to adopt appropriate changes to their programmes. 

That's what they are partially doing. They are raising awareness in the general population which then hopefully transforms into general population voting the Greens.

&gt;This needs boring canvassing work that is not nearly as theatrical as what people assaulting coal mines see themselves as worthy of but it's also the only thing that can actually have any results.

Why do you believe boring canvassing is the only thing that can have any results? Why do you refuse to believe demonstrations affect public opinion and action?

Are we talking about this issue because of canvassing? Or are we talking abou this because people demonstrated?

&gt;Though in reality, Germany alone is not enough to make much of a difference, and the main emphasis should really be on diplomatic pressure and even building special ad-hoc alliances with other concerned parties to actually achieve real change in the world. 

In reality demonstrating influences public opinion. Public opinion influences via election. Elections influence government. Government influences how the country uses diplomacy. This is the reality demonstrations deal with.

&gt;That should be the priority #1 for anyone truly concerned with this issue, not some European mine or plant that has infinitesimal actual outcome.

How I see it you are trying to dismiss these demonstrations. How I see it, you behave like the *petit bourgeois* who you said resists this kind of protests. Earlier you said you are genuinely interested to hear reasoning for this kind of protests, but it seems you are trying to find reasons to dismiss the protests. That even if the protests do influence the coal mine, that's a wrong priority and that the people protesting are not ""truly"" concerned with climate change, because they don't do what you want.

&gt;Climate change really isn't an issue that could be affected, let alone solved, locally.

Actually the global environmental movement has somewhat shifted the focus on local action precisely because previously they did try to influence global politics, UN meetings and such. 

It didn't work.

So many environmental campaigners have shifted the focus on local issues, because local issues are a way to force politicians to take a stand concerning something more concrete to the local people, and via that it influences the wider politics, including diplomacy. If a politician says they don't want a coal phase out until 2040 it's rather easy to dismiss. But if a politician is opposing closing down the coal power plant in your city, it is much more concrete and influences public opinion and politics.

Also it is much easier for politics to push for some initiatives globally when they know they can implement them. If some party supports the burning of peat locally, it is much harder for them to push for end of peat burning in EU, since they are not ready for that locally. But if they have a local plan on phasing out peat use, they are much more likely to push for that in EU since they are more ready to implement the phase out.",Finland,/r/europe/comments/c3ulbt/right_now_thousands_of_climate_activists_from_all/ervusd4/,Toby_Forrester,1561325568

That was after the heavy subsidies did all the damage in the industry. setting back investments in renewables. but you don't care about that right? because that wouldn't fit In your little world, right?

the market did not crash when she canceled that (what she did was getting the subsidies from way too high to a normal level. they should never habe been so high as they were in the beginning). It just showed how these ""companies"" that crashed didn't have a sustainable business model or a plan, they just put out renewables as fast as possible to get those sweet subsidies. that was the problem, not the part where it was brought down to a normal level. but I guess you think companies who are in the market for a long time and actually know how to run these plants aren't as important as some start ups pumping out plants for the subs. ofc not.

In them, she emphasized that she does not denounce the Ustasha movement and the ‘regular Ustashe’ and she relativized Ante Pavelić’s responsibility.

&gt;‘I could never abide ill will towards the Ustasha movement prior to 1941 and I do not denounce the regular Ustashe who fought for Croatia, but who did not commit crimes. Why would I denounce them?’ said Tomašić in a phone conversation with Novosti, adding that ‘the Ustashe have to be differentiated from what happened in NDH.’

&gt;Holocaust historian Efraim Zuroff from the Jerusalem-based Simon Wiesenthal Centre called upon Croatian political leaders on Wednesday to reject MEP Ruza Tomasic’s recent statements of sympathy for the Ustasa movement.
&gt;“Ruza Tomasic is considered by many Croatians to be an excellent MEP with impressive achievements in her previous terms on behalf of Croatia. It might have been possible to overlook her activities on behalf of Croatian extremists, if she had sincerely renounced fascism and the genodical policies of the NDH,” Zuroff said.

&gt;“Since that is not the case, however, and she still expresses support for a movement which should be universally condemned, we urge Croatian leaders to unequivocally distance themselves from the dangerous and repulsive views of MEP Ruza Tomasic,”

Or maybe, just maybe... you don't. Maybe I'm taking you completely out of context and we should challenge each other, instead, on things we've actually said - and not things we've just imagined off the top of our heads.

I never said anything about destroying churches or buildings of note built during British rule. Only the homes of landlords. Last week, two young boys were convicted for the murder of Ana Kriegel. That poor girl's body was found in Glenwood House, which was designed by James Gandon, the same person who designed buildings like the Customs House, Four Courts etc.

Glenwood House is a protected structure and a local conservation group called Old Lucan had been campaigning for it's restoration. Following that murder, however, they changed course and said ""Once the trial is over it should be knocked down and so should the adjacent buildings.” 

So you see, once that building had an association with a horrific crime, even people who appreciated it's architectural significance realised it would be better off removed from the landscape. The serial killer Fred West's house was destroyed after his crimes were uncovered. Jimmy Savile's headstone was removed.

So if the crime in question involves the death of not one person, but more than 1 million human beings, it seems equally reasonable that it should be removed from this earth.

5368,"&gt; No one believes we are exclusively Dacians. The that our ancestors lived here even before the Romans, it’s true, otherwise you’d be supporting the 100% Roman theory which is just as sci-fi as the Dacian one. 

It is not an either/or. It's not either Dacians, Romans, or Daco-Romans. 

There is not one origin. A people is not a person, they don't have a date of birth and 2 parents. There have been countless influences from many many people with no pivotal contribution. 

There are have been contributions ranging from sarmatians to turkic tribes to ottomans to slavs to greeks to bulgarians to hungarians. 

Dacians are not more important than pecenegs and cumans. Heck these two turkic tribes have been quite more important to the history of the Romanians since they established the first voievodats of Romania. 

&gt;  As long as those words exist in both Romanian and Albanian

Well a guy who pushed a lot for a ""Albanian are Dacian"" is Russu a historian who lived during communism, he is also the 3rd biggest contributor to the list of ""Dacian"" words.

5370,"&gt;They don't have detailed plans, but they have plans.

... But if that is their plan, then the current government has the same plan. ""shut down coal, build renewables"" is the plan then. which is the same as the current government does. all the greens then did is be like ""ya know, 2038 seems. a bit far away, let's take another number. 2022 sounds nice let's take that."".

which is absolute bullshit because if they can spew out that number, they absolutely have to have a detailed plan set up so it will work till that date. If they don't have that plan, then the number 2022 is just a random number they picked and nothing else.

&gt;What party is better than them? Because most other parties are even more planless than them and only talk and no doing.

better? well, pretty much any party is better than the greens. The greens in the government would mean building of renewable plants would prolly take even longer than now. (because they sure love to protest these plants too!)

But then again, the current government has a goal of 2038. which seems reasonable as a timeframe. I think it's a bit conservative and a little long, I guess 2028 or 2030 would be doable,harder but doable. but 2038 is a lot more realistic than 2022. Want it to be 2022? Then better share how you plan to do that at least somewhat realistically because without that super plan it's a useless number shouted to get votes and nothing else. 

That's one of the huge problems of the greens (not only in Germany). They want a lot of stuff. they want a lot of stuff fast and are loud about it
 But I have yet to hear HOW they want to achieve that goal. And this is a crucial part in this whole thing. they set unrealistic goals just to get some votes and nothing else.",,/r/europe/comments/c3ulbt/right_now_thousands_of_climate_activists_from_all/ervb7iz/,derTechs,1561311241

This conclusion finds further support from the fact that the loss of ranking of Italy and Greece does not coincide in time with the adoption of the euro: Italy started losing positions nearly 10 years before, even if there was an acceleration after 1999; Greece’s fall in the ranking only gained momentum in 2010, nearly 10 years after its adoption of the euro.",Luxembourg,/r/europe/comments/c4671l/gniperhead_rankings_the_sad_stories_of_greece_and/erv12sd/,JackRogers3,1561303430

5713,"That's above market commodity price of electricity. 

Additionally there are subsidized loans:

http://www.res-legal.eu/search-by-country/germany/single/s/res-e/t/promotion/aid/loan-kfw-renewable-energy-programme-standard/lastp/135/

&gt; Up to 100% of the investment costs eligible for financing (without VAT), however, not more than EUR 50 million per project. It is a long-term and low-interest (1,05 %) loan with a fixed interest period of 5 or 10 years including a repayment-free start-up period. A fixed interest period of up to 20 years is granted if technical and economic duration of co-financed investment is longer than 10 years. Moreover, a commitment fee of 0.25 % per month is charged.

And renewables are heavily indirectly subsidized because they have priority on energy market, thus additional grid-level costs like balancing, storage and new needed grid capacity are paid in distribution costs instead of being included in market commodity price. this amounts to €0.024 - €0.039/kWh for 30% of intermittent  electricity generation share (Germany was at 24.5% in 2018) according to [OECD report](https://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/nuclear-energy/the-full-costs-of-electricity-provision_9789264303119-en#page20)

So given 24.5% solar and wind share and OECD numbers
final price is approximately €0.0547/kWh + €0.0212/kWh = **€0.0759/kWh** and that's without those subsidized loans and other subsidies that I might miss.

When there is a need for such a pressure and society is conservative, insisting on such eventts is a good tool for lowering the poll status of current govenrment...

&amp;#x200B;

Ofcourse, it doesn't take much to have ""events"" with such events, so the government has to scan the protestors for paid provocators, while taking a popularity hit.

I imagine the police might record that piece of information in case it is relevant, but that doesn't mean it is classified as an anti-Semitic crime. Of course, it can be difficult to exactly count the numbers of such crimes. In statistics, they may say there have been x amount of crimes against Jews in the past, and that these numbers have markedly risen or that there are statistically more crimes against Jews are statistically higher. Of course, statistics are a fickle thing, but I would say all groups who are prepared to use violence against others are problematic, independent of their political/religious leanings.

1. Equipment requirements to generate as much power as single nuclear plant is much bigger. You need to build more stuff and waste more resources like cement, steel, etc.   
2. Land requirements. Nuclear power plant are VERY small compared to solar and wind farms. In most countries there are none empty spaces to put those farms. Nature is everywhere. Construction of those farms would destroy a lot of natural habitats.  
3. Current technology behind electricity is based on continuous feeding to the grid. Going full solar/wind adds very big costs of producing energy storage infrastructure that does not exists in most countries.

I have simple hypothesis.

A lot of early anti-nuclear movements in Europe/USA were sponsored by Soviet intelligence. Early nuclear technology was inseparable from atomic weaponry. Soviets couldn't keep up with western production of atomic bombs until 80s and that's why they sponsored a lot of green anti-nuclear movements. All of the early gurus and leaders of those movements were either ""useful idiots"" or direct agents. They raised new generations which were not aware of that...

...We are now in 2019. Obviously, no one currently is Soviet agent at this point. Even Russian, Iranian or North Korean.

However what we pay is **a lot** less than what Germans pay for their gas. And it's roughly similar throughout Western Europe. Your prices aren't really relevant to this Germany-specific discussion. 

Though generally speaking - it's not a bad idea overall to switch the remaining coal plants over to gas - it's just not yet possible. Even after North Stream II comes into operation there won't quite be enough capacity there for all of it, especially if Druzhba will die off as it's expected to for political reasons. Yamal-Evropa and North Stream aren't nor won't be enough, and LNG is insanely expensive. To change all coal over to gas requires a lot of new pipes which, considering the political shitstorm over North Stream seem rather unlikely. At least in sufficient numbers.
