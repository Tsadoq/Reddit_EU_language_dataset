64,"&gt; (flu, cold), where reinfections are likely but much less severe than the first time.

They're not though. The reason the flu keeps coming back is because there are 4-5 different strains. Once you get one you're immune for many years, until a different strain shows up. 

This is also why people don't get the fly every year, but more like once in 10 or 20 years when a different strain shows up.

&gt; The difference is that you come into contact with other coronaviruses as a child with a very strong immune system and build lifelong resistance without much risk, but this virus is new so adults have no resistance and get hit hard.

The vast majority of adults (~97%) are not getting hit hard. Only ~3% of the infections are severe, the vast majority of adults have mild or no symptoms from infection.

&gt; A vaccine would then give adults resistance, not immunity, while children catch it and get over it easily, and from this generation onward, it would just be another flu.

A free press is an essential part of democracy. Without it, you cannot truly call yourself a democratic nation. In my humble opinion, you can't have fair elections without a free press. Therefore, the leadership in countries without a free press, or with a severely suppressed press, cannot be called legitimate. 

Even more so, the EU demands that you have a free press. In a perfect EU, you wouldn't be allowed to be a member if you do not have a free press. Countries without an actual free press should feel lucky that the EU is far from perfect, since it has no interest and/or proper tools to defend its own values, among which a free press.

From irrigation to big farms undercutting smaller farms and running them out of business then cranking the price. From monopoly to insurances that don't pay. 

There are so many problems that governments learned with blood and death that need to be avoided at all costs. 

From the famous French revolution to most of global meteorological events that caused small ice ages, from corrupt politicians that hoarded food to starve people just for funzies, shits and giggles to mass hoarders of land that was abandoned because, as you said : profit, nevermind all the epidemics that plagued Europe throughout the milenia and forced innovation at a massive scale because, as you said, who cares, the boyards need the monz, who cares if a bunch of peasants die of starvation, the boyards had weapons and the funding for personal bodyguards, the peasants only had numbers on their side. Being more profitable to keep it barren than to farm even 1 square cm. 

Remember this: you can live without entertainment, you can survive without healthcare for quite a while, you can live happily without ever engaging with politicians, but water and food? 

In this world equation the hand of the free market that makes food scarse to make profit caused so many unnecessary deaths, and governments were beheaded/ shot / bleed / smashed / skewerd / burned alive / or, just plain old forced to eat all the food hoarded until they exploded it's not even funny at this point.",,/r/europe/comments/ifqvoy/eu_subsidies_benefit_big_farms_while_underfunding/g2s13ry/,hellrete,1598339655

321,"I grew up in France, born in the 1980s, and if anything stories I hear from children today actually paint teachers as being more uptight and to some degree more abusive than mine back then. 

It was more chill and less unhinged (teachers as well as children). Granted, kids are also way more awaken / active at a given age than what I remember just 3 decades ago, so it might be a reason.

But public French K-12 education (and beyond...) has mostly stagnated since then, still no computing devices in classes, old fashion everything from board to books (and 'apps' or school networks are barely functional on a good day), same old methods mostly (like languages, the French are still as bad as ever to teach/learn those, no regular lab hours if at all to practice, etc.), so it's like the country is frozen in time. 

But kids certainly changed as they always adapt to their time, while teachers however are mostly stuck in the mindsets of the last century so... I don't really know what to make of it. I think there's a growing gap that prevents the French society at large, and school in particular, to engage on a more liberal path. Friction gets harder and harder as time passes by.

It's weird. But I'm sometimes a bit horrified by what I hear, the punishments haven't gone back 50 years to re-become physical but the psychological violence... man. Like public humiliation, or destroying self-confidence with incredibly harsh words / remarks... that's worse than in my time and deeply troubling sometimes (and these teachers never receive a blame, they are all powerful in the institution apparently). In my time there were limits that the school director would enforce.

(Speaking anecdotally, having friends with kids in the 1-10 bracket and a few of them being teachers themselves, appalled by these behaviors they tell me about from their coworkers. No apparent relation with political alignment or that sort of thing, though most are leftists almost Marxists/communists, but so are these friends so I don't see it as a determinant).",,/r/europe/comments/ifvxpm/the_last_year_of_ussr_and_my_first_day_in_school/g2rrzsi/,dysonCode,1598331494

Grades were all public, you better not get anything less than a '5' or you're gonna get a red face. Teachers would really grill you for poor performance, and it was absolutely public, naturally. We had to memorise insane amounts of stuff, above and beyond what kids today do, so I'd recite five pages of poetry from my memory, even prose -- seems unimaginable now. 

Teachers couldn't hit you (or wouldn't anyway, not sure what was the rule) but they had a really canny way of tearing you down emotionally until all that was left was your desire to study. Or at least that's how mine was. You had the same primary teacher for the entirety of the primary school. You stuck with you class for many years and they would become like brothers and sisters to you, I miss that, I live in the States now and I feel sorry for kids here who don't get to experience the sheer camaraderie of surviving all that together. The nerd and the jock, the weirdo and the popular kid, we were all family and it felt great. 

I miss the uniforms too. I wore a green blazer and green pants. A nice shade of forest green. Girls wore this reddish-purple colour, they could either wear skirts or pants, but they wore blazers as well. To this day, green is my fav colour, although I think that's more because I like nature and all.

416,"&gt;I mean, really. It's a ranking of top universities.

Top universities in terms of plagiarized papers. You are ignoring that fact again and again simply to win an internet argument.

They are not actually the top or the best. Look at any number of the other rankings that focus on original research and not just how many fake papers they spinned. 

&gt;Obviously you can be critical of that figure, but why lie that it exists?

Lmao, no. You seem to be utterly brainwashed by their obvious propaganda. They intentionally boost the number of papers they publish just to get a boost in rankings like this. Its not original research they are doing, just copying the same shit to GAME the system. CHEAT like they do with everything else. Why does this have to be repeated to you again and again?

Its a pity fools like you can't separate facts form propaganda and then accuse others of lying when facts are presented to you.

532,"I thought it was self explanatory but if you want me to break it down to you, it is about demanding for something new and being in favor of status quo. Turkey and Greece signed the treaty when the world was accepting the territorial sea limit as 3 nautical miles. So after UNCLOS presented to the world at 80's, Greece signed it but Turkey did not. ( along eith 60 other countries like the US, Israel etc.) So Greece demands something from Turkey but instead of try to solve the issue bilaterally, they are accusing oTurkey for violations. Which is not true. There is a principle of good faith in international law. If Greece were to expand her sea territory to 12 miles, Greece would control more than 90% of Agea and Turkey's territory would shrink less then 10%. I don't want to get in more details but somehow these two countries accused eachother for violating international laws but in fact none of them are violating it. But it is a fact that this issue is not Turkey's issue. What i mean by that is Turkey is not the side that is demanding something new and not the side whoch wants to change status quo. The best way to do is to solve it with bilateral relations but as you already know, they are failed to do so. But it came to a point where both countries are sending their warships to East Med. Which i think the issue with Agean Sea, Cyprus and East Med problems are all related with eachother. In order to have a good bilateral relationship with Turkey, Greece needs to act according to principle of good faith. But instead of doing that, they are choosing to propagate against Turkey on Western world and attack Turkey's reputation. And act like its a violation of international law that doing researches in a sea which is not officially claimed by any country. Because none of the countries did not officially declared their EEZs. What Turkey has been doing is not violation at all. 

I carried away and answered your question with an unfocused answer but in summary, it is about principle of good faith. And Turkey reserves her right on that.

Subsidies go to the organizations that can pay for the best drafted projects and people. 

Don't get me wrong, I not saying we should stop it or anything but as long as the process is a meritocratic one the people with the most money to pay experienced project managers and researches to draft these project and as long as subsidies are a percentage of a project they will benefit the big guys.

Green project inherently make less money because they are sacrificing profit for sustainability. Go play Anno 2070 if you don't get the concept. 

Same with the poor, a farmer that is makes say 50.000€~100.000€ yearly net-flow of money is not going to have anywhere near the resources to invest because at the end of the day hes probably only making 20.000~30.000 off of that. He needs that to fund his private life and family. 

For him going into dept to build a drying/stirring silo to dry his own crops or invest in a combine is huge. 

Agriculture in todays climate is not suited to small farmers at all. Tractors cost too much and come with DRM. Seeds are licensed, you need a combine or similar device to actually harvest efficiently. And then you need the entire transport infrastructure to deliver the tons of produce you make.

The last valid agreement between the two countries regarding the limits of the sea territorries in Agea is Treaty of Lausanne. And the world wide standart for nautical mile limit was 3 at that time. Even the agreement on which islands are going to be given under control of which country was measured by that specific limit. What if Turkey demands that if we are going ro break status quo and ignore 3 miles, then i want you to give me the control of the islands within the new agreed limit? If you think it sounds unlawful, it certainly is not. Because the islands also given to Greece under the condition of demilitarising them. Which you already know Greece is already violating that. So yeah, it doesn't say by these exact words but the last valid agreement between the two countries regarding the limitations of sea territorries is The Treaty of Laussanne and it is very clear that the norm was to limit the sea territory to 3 nautical miles. If you want to be technically correct, you are correct. But it is not misleading at all. What is misleading is accusing Turkey or violating international law on East Med, acting like Greece is not violating the Treaty of Laussanne by militarizing the islands in Agea and accusing Turkey of violating Greece's airspace when the nautical miles of Greece is 6 miles and their declared airspace is 10 miles. Which it is kinda unique. I don't even know any other country who does that. In my knowledge, all country's airspace limit is where their sea territory ends.

Apart from *de facto* being in power for longer than Lukashenko, Djukanovic has also patented the Putin-Medvedev switcheroo before Putin and Medvedev (switching between president and prime-minister positions, while de facto being in charge the whole time).

The highway section that I mentioned is really expensive due to mountainous terrain (hence the name Montenegro) and also probably due to corruption.

627,"So you really think ""us eurocommunists"" in general don't see the problems with communism under the USSR or especially the PRC? Okay, yeah, some tankies don't and they're dumb and thoughtless. The problem is that while, yes, communism so far has only existed under brutal regimes and even though not all of them racked up a genocide, and others even fought against genocide communists, dissent was cracked down on hard, free speech was nearly non-existent and we could go on and on about problems with their regimes. Now, I wouldn't want to live under such a regime. But no way in hell does that mean I don't think something fundamental needs to change in western society because our current situation is hurting people and this won't just stop after reforms. Does that make me a communist? I've never voted communist and probably never will.

On top of that, you've never lived under a Nazi regime.

Then any other subsidiary of the company has to pay them to use that IP, internet infrastructure, licenses and whatnot at high fees. Meaning that any unit sold outside of Ireland has added costs, while the company in Ireland has mostly profits.

Taxes are paid on profits rather then how much money you gain before expenses. This allows for the shifting of tax payment from one country to another.

Legally it's rather difficult to tackle this because the business isn't technically doing anything that any other business would not.

That's without getting into loopholes that allow the tax in Ireland or whatever tax haven to go much bellow the normal tax rate for the country. Those are the draw to use this trick.",,/r/europe/comments/ifcdtk/profit_booked_by_us_multinationals_in_various/g2p1qnz/,fornocompensation,1598280162

1004,"&gt;According to the Berlin Charité hospital, clinical findings point to poisoning of Kremlin critic Alexei Nawalny. The findings indicated ""an intoxication by a substance from the active substance group of cholinesterase inhibitors"", although the specific substance is not yet known, explained the Charité.

&gt;Nawalny had lost consciousness in pain in an airplane during a trip to Siberia. It also became known that he was allegedly shadowed by security forces during his stay in Siberia.

&gt;For years, Nawalny has been one of President Vladimir Putin's most prominent opponents. The activist has made many enemies with his research on corruption and abuse of power. Nawalny addresses this topic more clearly than almost anyone else in Russia. Since Thursday he has been in a coma. Initially he was treated in a hospital in Siberia, but on the weekend he was transferred to the Charité.
Nawalny is guarded by the BKA

&gt;In the university hospital Charité he is guarded by officials of the Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA), said government spokesman Steffen Seibert. ""After all, this is a patient on whom a poison attack has been committed with a certain probability"".

&gt;Nawalny's spokeswoman Kira Jarmysch emphasized that her colleagues had already filed a complaint with the Russian authorities days ago about a possible poisoning. However, no criminal investigations have been initiated despite the expiry of a deadline, she wrote on Twitter.

&gt;Nawalny's closest circle assumes that the 44-year-old was poisoned. The Russian doctors, however, spoke of metabolic problems. There is no sufficient evidence for poisoning, they said. They had done everything necessary, said the head physician of the clinic in Omsk, Alexander Murachowski. The authorities had not exerted any pressure on them. ""We took care of the patient and we saved him. There was no outside influence on the patient's treatment.""

&gt;In the Russian state media different versions of why Nawalny is in a coma have been circulating for days - from alcohol consumption, a diet to hypoglycemia.

&gt;  
&gt;Security, openness and solidarity - these are the three pillars of the plan for Poland's solidarity with Belarusian society, presented by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki in the Sejm. Our country will allocate PLN 50 million in the first year of the programme. These will be additional funds, over and above those which Poland is channelling to other programmes related to Belarus, such as Belsat television. In Belarus, protests are continuing after the presidential elections of 9 August, which, according to official results, were won by Lukashenko, winning over 80% of the votes.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- What we will have to face today is, as the political situation in Belarus develops, either to concentrate on helping those who are being repressed and persecuted, or to support a society that is emerging before our very eyes as an active civil society,' says Rafał Dzięciołowski.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Dear Belarusian Friends,  
&gt;  
&gt;The International Solidarity Foundation (FSM) has been supporting Belarusian society for years in its quest for freedom, democracy and full independence. We are observing with great concern what is currently happening in your country, where the blood of innocent people has been shed and their peaceful pursuit of truth and life in a justly governed state has been brutally trampled upon. We admire your courage and determination.  
&gt;  
&gt;The historical proximity of our nations and the respect for human rights that underpins European civilisation and culture, of which you, too, are a part of, do not allow us to pass by indifferently to repression, torture, beatings and imprisonment of people, or dismissal. We will not leave you alone in this difficult and perhaps crucial moment for the fate of the whole of Belarus. We want to show our solidarity with you and our concern for the fate of your loved ones with concrete actions.  
&gt;  
&gt;In this connection, FSM will support the Polish programme to help people who are being repressed under the government's 'Solidarity with Belarus' plan. Assistance will be provided to all those who are:  
&gt;  
&gt;\- suffered as a result of the activities of OMON, the militia and other services (medical assistance, rehabilitation, psychological support),  
&gt;  
&gt;\- have been made redundant or exposed to financial consequences due to participation in strikes or protests (legal aid, material and financial assistance, job search support),  
&gt;  
&gt;\- have been removed from schools or universities or subjected to other repressions (scholarship programme).  
&gt;  
&gt;We ask the injured persons to report to the e-mail address: [solidarni@solidarityfund.pl](mailto:solidarni@solidarityfund.pl)  
&gt;  
&gt;Details of support will be provided using secure means of communication.  
&gt;  
&gt;REMEMBER: NO ONE WILL BE LEFT ALONE.  
&gt;  
&gt;Long live Belarus!

It's obvious as a day and night for anyone who is willing to do some research and doesn't approach it with a patriotic/nationalist mindset.

1083,"I'm not sure if you can find such indicators. Or well, you might find, but only some local indicators. For example, Moldova's GDP per capita has now recovered, but that doesn't tell you the full picture. For example, a big part of it are remittances – money sent from abroad. A healthy economy usually relies very little on that. At the same time, the country's population has plunged from 4.4 million to \~3.1 million (it's difficult to get the exact figure because it includes the breakaway Transnistria region) in 30 years and this is almost fully mass emigration (Moldova's birth rate is actually relatively decent, owing to the huge share of rural population), and this without EU's freedom of movement.

I'm sure the horror stories of people selling their kidney for money is a thing of the past at this point as well, but it does illustrate just how severe things got at one point. The problem here isn't that Moldova would necessarily have worse indicators than in late 1980s, but it has gone through such a miserable period which has permanently damaged the country. 

So while indicators such as life expectancy or GDP per capita are better off now, they've fallen to among the very worst in Europe. This increases pressure for emigration beause much of our sense of prosperity is relative.

1123,"Britain appears to be on course to enjoy a record-breaking economic recovery in the third quarter, fuelled by consumers who are spending again after the coronavirus lockdown and a planned reopening of schools.

Although the UK economy has been hit hard during the pandemic — it recorded the sharpest fall in gross domestic product in the second quarter compared with the last three months of 2019 of any G7 nation — new data on spending suggest many Britons are splashing the cash once more.

Total consumer spending — including leisure — during the first two weeks of August exceeded the same period one year earlier, according to figures from Fable Data, a consultancy. This is the first time there has been annual growth in spending since the lockdown was introduced in March.

A new average of forecasts by City of London economists suggests that GDP is set to rise 14.3 per cent in the third quarter, reversing 55 per cent of the 20.4 per cent drop in output in the three months to June 30.

The predicted GDP growth for the three months to September 30 would be a record, with economists’ forecasts showing the UK likely to move from the bottom of the G7 performance table in the second quarter to the top in the third.

But the trajectory of the economy after this bounce is much more difficult to predict, said independent forecasters, with a lot depending on the spread of Covid-19, the quantum of social distancing measures, and whether consumers rein in their spending amid rising unemployment and a possible second wave of infections. These factors are heavily interlinked, added the economists.

Recommended Why the UK economy stands out Consumer spending initially recovered relatively slowly in the UK compared to elsewhere in Europe. The shutdown of most shops, restaurants and pubs had to be kept in place longer to counter higher infection rates in Britain, but the relaxation of restrictions in June and July has brought a big change in spending patterns.

Retail sales in July were up 3.6 per cent from June, and 1.4 per cent higher than one year earlier, according to figures published by the Office for National Statistics on Friday.

In the first two weeks of August, consumer spending, including leisure, was about 7 per cent higher than during the same period one year earlier, said Fable Data, which collates information across many different forms of electronic payment.

More meals have been bought in pubs and restaurants due to the government’s “eat out to help out” discount scheme that runs through August, said Avinash Srinivasan, analyst at Fable Data.

“We have clearly seen an improvement [in total spending] over the past month,” he added.

Car sales in July were 11.3 per cent higher than a year earlier, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, indicating a level of pent-up demand for big-ticket items that is expected to persist well into the third quarter.

While the easing of lockdown restrictions has prompted a sharp rise in consumer spending, third-quarter GDP should also be boosted by the proposed reopening of schools across much of the UK in September.

Education is a significant contributor to output: after schools closed towards the end of March, the sector’s real output fell 34 per cent in the second quarter, contributing 1.9 percentage points to the 20.4 per cent decline in GDP.

The ONS indicated that accounting for the school holidays is a big challenge in GDP data, but its emerging view was that the sector’s lost output from the second quarter should be reversed in the July and August figures for output. This is considerably earlier than when most schools reopen, but it reflects seasonal adjustments by the ONS to the GDP data.

These adjustments are expected to boost the monthly GDP growth figures for July and August by about 2.5 percentage points.

Recommended Pandemic shows US must make vital products at home Jonathan Portes, professor of economics at King’s College London, said: “One key reason the UK’s economic performance appeared worse than other countries is that the ONS has done a better job of estimating the fall in education outputs in the second quarter. That means output will automatically bounce back.”

GDP growth in the third quarter could also potentially benefit from a rebound in the health sector. It shrank in the second quarter, partly reflecting how hospitals cancelled routine operations to focus on treatment of Covid-19 patients.

But the scale of the boost is unclear, and some economists think that the ONS overestimated the decline in output in the education and health sectors in the second quarter.

Andrew Sentance, adviser to Cambridge Econometrics, a consultancy, said: “The ONS has not allowed for the fact that activities have had to be adapted to changing circumstances. So the [statisticians] have grossly over-egged the fall in output in the second quarter.”

The July and August GDP figures, released in September and October, could well provide some relief for the government, currently reeling from the secondary school results fiasco in England.

As Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane has said repeatedly, GDP data containing better economic news might encourage more consumers to spend.

Mr Haldane wrote this month that it was “important that good economic news is not drowned out by the bad and the ugly . . . [because] boosting confidence about our financial future would reap its own economic reward”.

Line chart of Annual spending change by week (%) showing Some areas of spending have improved rapidly in recent weeks

But the anticipated big rebound in third-quarter GDP will not be sufficient to resolve lingering doubts about Britain’s economic strength.

Several factors risk holding back the recovery, led by the wind down of the government’s furlough scheme and the fact many business activities are not fully viable while the virus persists.

Samuel Tombs, economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said that Britain’s long-term economic recovery will be much more difficult after a stunning third quarter.

“The economy’s high reliance on consumer services and the impending withdrawal of government support for the labour market suggests that the level of GDP will track a lower path than in most other economies going forwards,” he added.",,/r/europe/comments/ifo47c/uk_set_for_recordbreaking_economic_growth_in/g2opjsr/,benign_humour,1598273147

1211,"&gt; Heroyam Slava!

Quoting Wikipedia:

*The modern response ""Heroiam slava!"" (Glory to the heroes!) appeared in the 1930s among members of the [Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization_of_Ukrainian_Nationalists) (OUN) and [Ukrainian Insurgent Army](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_Insurgent_Army) (UPA) who started using this slogan,[[2]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glory_to_Ukraine#cite_note-AC28565063RFE-2) replacing all former responses with it as a mark of deep respect for all the men and women who had laid down their lives for their country.*


OUN/UPA were nazi collaborators

*Although most Jews were actually killed by Germans, the OUN police, working for the Germans, played a crucial supporting role in the liquidation of 200,000 Jews in Volhynia in the second half of 1942[[116]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_Insurgent_Army#cite_note-Nations._pg._162-116) although in isolated cases Ukrainian policemen also helped Jews to escape.[[117]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_Insurgent_Army#cite_note-117) Most of the police deserted in the following spring and joined UPA.[[116]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_Insurgent_Army#cite_note-Nations._pg._162-116)

Numerous accounts ascribe to the UPA a role in the killing of [Ukrainian Jews](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_Jews) under the German occupation.[[118]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_Insurgent_Army#cite_note-EncHol-118)[[119]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_Insurgent_Army#cite_note-Piotr-119) According to Ray Brandon, co-editor of The Shoah in Ukraine, ""Jews in hiding in Volhynia saw the UPA as a threat.""[[120]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_Insurgent_Army#cite_note-120)

While anti-Semitism did not play a significant role in Ukrainian politics,[[citation needed](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)] with the first anti-Semitic ideology and acts traced back to the [Russian Civil War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War), by 1940-41 the publications of Ukrainian terrorist organizations became explicitly anti-Semitic.[[121]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_Insurgent_Army#cite_note-121) German documents of the period give the impression that Ukrainian [ultranationalists](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultranationalists) were indifferent to the plight of the Jews and would either kill them or help them, whichever was more appropriate for their political goals.[[122]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_Insurgent_Army#cite_note-122) According to [John Paul Himka](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Paul_Himka), OUN militias were responsible for a wave of pogroms in Lviv and western Ukraine in 1941 that claimed thousands of Jewish lives.*",,/r/europe/comments/ifkirr/on_this_day_29_years_ago_ukraine_declared_its/g2ogjzy/,tristes_tigres,1598265786

1330,"&gt;In Belarus, it seems that it does, otherwise why would there be support funds?

They're not specifically for strikes. The government can try to intimidate workers by firing or arresting them. They're also for people that suffered and died from police violence.

&gt;Lukashenko, obviously is waiting for it in order to justify the killing of people. 

Lol. I'm sorry but you're clearly unfamiliar with the situation in Belarus. There was violence and deaths from day one of the protests. He's a dictator, he doesn't have to justify shit. He released the police onto peaceful demonstrators and bystanders, what police did can in some ways rival Gestapo (60 people in a 4-person cell, gas in a police van, people in jail being put face down on the ground in two layers, people nowhere near the protests being brutalized and killed, cars that are driving by being shot, people being hanged, a person being shot dead with rifles while having his hands up and standing alone 20 feet away from a crowd of police, etc, etc).

&gt;And what do you do with the forces sent there by Putin in order to protect Lukashenko

So far I can't see any realistic reason for him to do that. There's no external threat, there's no violence from the protesters and you can't exactly force people to work with guns, Russia doesn't really have a history of saving a regimes that is clearly falling (and doesn't have a war zone in the country) and has almost no support from the population.

I want your money. Should I just rob you?

&gt;That is not at all what I am saying. Is your point that conscripts would die only for the governing power and it's whims? Are you saying that only minority of given nation that conscripts wants that system?

that is exactly what you are saying. If conscripts willing defend the country then there is no need for conscription. Just let people volunteer.

&gt;I can't speak for other nations, but conscription is not a minority driven affair in Finland. 68% of finns thinks that if Finland is attacked, should Finland defend itself with arms, even if the result of the war looks grim. 2019, 80% of the youth (fighting age) thought that Finland should preserve conscription. Numbers fluctuate, but the trend is generally in support of armed defence and conscription.

Numbers don't matter. If 3 people decided to rape you, is it still considered rape? It's a 75% approval rate.

&gt;No. I want to live in a democratic and peaceful society, just the way I am currently. Patriotism comes as a result, for living in a society that is free, just and happy. It is not the driving force. Finnish conscription ensures the security of that for the foreseeable future.

Several staff described their nervousness about identifying the ethnic origins of perpetrators for fear of being thought racist; others remembered clear direction from their managers not to do so.

1647,"The hypocrisy in the comments is real.  It must be the lack of knowledge in history.  Turning a blind eye to the fact that Europeans have done this before.  And the Christian conquest of Moorish Spain where they knocked down mosques and built cathedrals and parish churches.  
""The spread of Christianity saw the conversion of numerous ancient Greek and Roman temples into churches. The Parthenon in Athens, built almost twenty-five centuries ago to honour Greek gods, served as a church for centuries. At one stage it even housed a little mosque. A fine medieval synagogue in Toledo, Spain, was taken from the Jews centuries ago. Since then it has served as both a monastery and an armoury. Today, under the name Santa Maria la Blanca, it is part of a Roman Catholic church complex.""  
'In 1236 the march of Christian conquest — what the Spanish often call “the Reconquista” — brought Cordoba under Christian rule, and the mosque was converted into a church, the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Assumption. In the early sixteenth century, Christians scooped out the heart of the structure and built a vast nave in its place. When the emperor, Charles V, saw it he is said to have exclaimed, “You have destroyed something unique in order to build something that could have been built anywhere.”' -abc.net.au  
  
Also look around Europe, instead of building new mosques or giving new spaces of worship to muslims, they are converting churches to mosques. Eg. Fatih Camii Mosque in Amsterdam. Which was a church. The government shouldn't allow such things if it's such a big deal.  
The municipality of Antwerp, Belgium, proposed to transform the empty churches into mosques.  
To mention just some churches turned into mosques, there is the Central Mosque of Brent, the St. Marks Cathedral which is now called New Peckam Mosque and the former Wesleyan Methodist Church. The mosque of Disbury in Manchester was a Methodist church, and a Catholic church in Sydney, Nova Scotia, will become a mosque. In Clitheroe, Lancashire, the municipal authorities have granted permission to turn an Anglican church into a mosque.  
  
So maybe have a good hard look at yourselves and read a history book before you start pointing the finger.

Regarding financial and economical exploitation of resources, it has to be agreed upon an international law or bilateral agreement.

I don’t think that both countries would like to have a global tribunal every time, but rather well defined territories

But for caring about water and oceans I definitely agree with you. Pollution, overfishing, and other problems affect more than one country’s territory.

2135,"&gt;The UK has been accused of ""strengthening and legitimising"" Belarus's dictatorship after it emerged that British forces have been providing training to the country's military.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Alexander Lukashenko's government, long regarded as the Europe's last classic dictatorship, has faced down pro-democracy protests in recent weeks triggered by the result of the country's latest rigged election.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Thousands of protesters have been detained by authorities, hundreds thought to have been tortured, and at least four have died. On Sunday, amid ongoing protests in central Minsk, the Defence Ministry announced the army would be deployed to ""protect national monuments.""  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Campaigners said the UK has been helping the ""aggressive wing of a deeply repressive and authoritarian sate"" by providing training to troops and commanders in the country's armed forces.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;As recently as March the Ministry of Defence openly announced that British Royal Marines had ""shared essential experience and expertise with Belarusian forces"" in joint exercises.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;UK ministers also admitted that the UK had provided advanced training courses to officers in the country's military.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Belarusian troops are also known to have attended exercises in the UK for several years running, winning medals in military trials.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Images of British troops training alongside Belarusian forces have also been used as publicity in state media, which campaigners say gives extra legitimacy to the regime back at home.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;""The Belarus armed forces are a very aggressive wing of a deeply repressive and authoritarian state. The brutal scenes that we have seen over recent weeks should concern us all,"" said Andrew Smith of Campaign Against Arms Trade.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;""The UK should not be doing anything that strengthens the Belarus authorities, and that must include an end to all military training.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;He added: ""The images of UK forces in Belarus were shown all over state media. The message this sent to the regime was one of support. The message it sent to pro-democracy campaigners was that their rights don't matter. Now more than ever, it is vitally important that the UK and other governments stop their hypocrisy and act in support and solidarity to those that are calling for democratic reform.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;""When the UK trains with human rights-abusing regimes, it strengthens them and gives them a greater legitimacy. It can only makes them more efficient in their repression. We have seen the deadly impact of UK military cooperation in Yemen, where UK-trained Saudi pilots have used UK-made arms to inflict a humanitarian crisis.""  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Belarus's contested elections, widely regarded as unfree and unfair, saw opposition candidate Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya flee to Lithuania after Mr Lukashenko claimed to have won 80 per cent of the vote.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The UK has said it does not accept the result of the elections, with Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab this week describing it as ""fraudulent"" and calling for an investigation by the independent OSCE.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;He said the world had ""watched with horror at the violence used by the Belarusian authorities to suppress the peaceful protests"".  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;But the latest repression come as little surprise in the country, which think-tank Freedom House has consistently rated as ""not free"" on account of it being ""an authoritarian state in which elections are openly orchestrated and civil liberties are tightly restricted"".  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;

Oh yes ! 

Let me show you some [info](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukowina):

&gt; Seit langem strebte die Habsburger Monarchie nach einer besseren Verbindung von Siebenbürgen zum gerade erworbenen Galizien. Nach dem Frieden von Kücük gelang es ihr 1775, bei der Hohen Pforte die Abtretung des 10.000 km² großen Gebietes zu erreichen. In dem Vertrag wurde es zum ersten Mal als Bukowina – Buchenland – bezeichnet.

&gt; Der humanitär gesinnte Joseph II., Kaiser des Heiligen Römischen Reiches und Erbe der Donaumonarchie, fand durch die Angliederung des Landes an das habsburgische Herrschaftsgebiet eine dankbare Aufgabe. Im Reich ließ er Aufrufe zur **Kolonisation** der Bukowina veröffentlichen. Der Widerhall war stark. In wochenlangen Trecks zogen Bauernfamilien, vorwiegend aus Württemberg, die Donau hinab. Viele blieben im Banat, andere zogen über die Karpaten oder über Galizien weiter.

It was a brutal **COLONISATION** like in Afrika, mein Junge !!

As if those areas had been void of any people, history, tradition, civilization, culture, religion or human feelings.

Up to these days old historical churches and monasteries in former Austrian-ocupied Bucovina display the terrible vandalism of the colonists and masters. Just come, visit and see !

&gt;  there were some villages with some amount of people with ancestors who came from German areas to settle there, some of them centuries ago

These are [different people](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siebenb%C3%BCrger_Sachsen#Zweiter_Weltkrieg)

In these areas history played out on square kilometers: we are Europe, not America. Austrian colonisation of North-Moldavia (Bukovina) has nothing to do with the German historical presence in Transsylvania.

Belarusian students expelled from the University of Warsaw can complete their studies at the University of Warsaw as part of the Konstanty Kalinowski Scholarship Program - inform the authorities of the largest Polish university.


Today, white and red and white flags have been placed in front of the Kazimierzowski Palace at the University of Warsaw. - Our academic community supports all those who want a free, democratic, civic and law-abiding Belarus. We want to express our appreciation and our solidarity. You are setting an example to follow,"" said Prof. Marcin Pałys, rector of the University. And he announced the extension of the activities supporting ""persons harmed by the actions of the Belarusian authorities"".

In view of the current situation in Belarus and the expected increase in the number of repressed people, it was decided to launch an additional recruitment under the Konstantin Kalinowski Scholarship Program of the Polish Government. As the university informs, students expelled from universities in Belarus receive scholarships for full studies in Poland, as well as one-year internships in Warsaw.

At the University of Warsaw, the program conducts the Study of Eastern Europe. Applications will be accepted on 31 August 2020. Applications will be accepted until the limit of places is reached. Its size is agreed with the Ministry of Science. The data will be available next week,"" Olga Laska from the Warsaw University Press Office informed us.

More information about the programme, qualification rules and formal requirements can be found on SEW UW website.

The University recalls that the Centre for Belarusian Studies also operates at the Study of Eastern Europe, which employs, among others, researchers dismissed from Belarusian universities for political reasons. - The University of Warsaw intends to invite other lecturers and researchers from Belarus to cooperate if they face repressions,"" announces Professor Marcin Pałys.

For example, GDP per capita is higher in the UK compared to France (it's like a 5% difference, but still a difference). So who is better off then if we look just at financials? And since agriculture work is mostly lower paid, then that is an added argument to give more support there, and France has more of that work.

An abundance of food can very easily turn into a shortage though, which is why stability for food production is so important. If everyone just goes to the cheapest source of food and then area is hit by a disaster, what happens?

Sure, other industries can be leveraged as well. For example steel production is a big one. Which is why from time to time steps are taken to prevent countries from dumping too much cheap steel on the market by implement tariffs (looking at China here). And a ton of other things.

Kastellorizo, little more than an outsized  boulder with a pretty harbour, lies barely 2km from Turkey’s famed  “Turquoise Coast”. I visited the area several times for book research  between 2004 and 2010. On my last visit bar one, a waiter at my hotel in  Kas, a Turkish tourist town, showed me the view of Greek Kastellorizo  from the top floor before taking aim at the island with an imaginary  ­machine gun and opening fire on its inhabitants — in mime. His  performance distilled, in dramatic fashion, Turkey’s attitude to Greece.  I suspect the young man harboured prideful cultural memories of the  Turkish massacre in 1922 of Greeks and Armenians in Smyrna, now Turkish  Izmir, a four-hour drive north from Kas.

The  Turkish atrocities in Smyrna, which brought to a head the Ottoman  Empire’s genocidal extermination of Christian minorities under the cover  of the Great War, were committed under the direct command of Mustapha  Kemal — the same Kemal, or Ataturk, whose words stir Australian  sentiments every Anzac Day: “Those heroes that shed their blood and lost  their lives.

This is rich considering the IRA [did the same thing](https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/sexual-violence-a-dark-secret-of-war-of-independence-and-civil-war-1.3752556) 

*The IRA was also involved in the destruction of many stately homes in Munster. The Church of Ireland Gazette recorded numerous instances of Unionists and Loyalists being shot, burnt or forced from their homes during the early 1920s. In County Cork between 1920 and 1923 the IRA shot over 200 civilians of whom over 70 (or 36%) were Protestants: five times the percentage of Protestants in the civilian population. This was due to the historical inclination of Protestants towards loyalty to the United Kingdom. A convention of Irish Protestant Churches in Dublin in May 1922 signed a resolution placing ""on record"" that ""hostility to Protestants by reason of their religion has been almost, if not wholly, unknown in the twenty-six counties in which Protestants are in the minority.""*[19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Republican_Army_(1919%E2%80%931922)#Violent_exchange)

&gt;Was it brave to appease Hitler? Good job, Chamberlain!

That was *before* WWII and he tried to keep the peace, unlike DeValera who signed the book of condolence in **April** **1945** bearing in mind at this point, even Brazil declared war on Germany. 

&gt;Was it brave to roundup Boer women and children and place them in concentration camps, denying them food?

This never happened. What happened was that Kitchener gave families who had men fighting for the Boers smaller ration amounts than those who did not, overall, the legacy of the concerntration camp system is one of neglect and negligence, not outright malice. 

&gt;Was it brave to fire upon peaceful protests, until the soldiers ran out of ammunition, in Amritsar? Was it brave of the British public to raise £26000 to gift to the criminal Reginald Dwyer as a thank you?

This wasn't sanctioned by the British government hence his reprimand and his dismissal from the British army. 

&gt;Was the slaughter of Kenyans in order to suppress a desire for independence during the Mau Mau Uprising brave?

*We are determined to have independence in peace, and we shall not allow hooligans to rule Kenya. We must have no hatred towards one another. Mau Mau was a disease which had been eradicated, and must never be remembered again.[18](https://www.cairn-int.info/article-E_VING_118_0045--jomo-kenyatta-and-kenyan-independence.htm#no18)**

**—Speech by Jomo Kenyatta, April 1963**

&gt;Was it brave when the British diverted food from India to feed British soldiers exacerbating a famine that killed at least 12 million people? Churchill himself said he hated Indian people, after all.

This is absolute bollocks, you even got the estimation wrong. 

&gt;Was it brave when the British authorities allowed the Irish population to half due to famine and subsequent emigration?

The wealth of Germany is also related that alot of economy has been done of investment in infrastructure and the country will need alot of renovation. Very old bridges, small roads, etc.

This is the case also for France and many develop countries. Actually Europe is just exploiting old infrastructure where heavy investment is needed for rural areas.


&gt;The bigger problem here is more that russia has a lot of paramilitary units that are not counted into the budget and also the country is veeerrrrrryyyyy big, great increase in investment in infrastructur is needed. The bigger cities don´t do bad because they are investing there, but just go outside of Moskau and you will see what I mean when I say more investments into the countries infrastructure. 

&gt;Russia is jsut spending way too much on it´s weapons while not spending enough on it´s own people, the risk of an uprising of the population there is not too small in my opinion. 

All the 3 big dogs have a higher military with USA having the most important military budget ever.

I do not despair Russia will come out of that. They already stabilise their country. It was way more unstable under the oligarchs.

2405,"Socialism is not illegal in countries where they did not damage the economy. Even consumerism is not illegal although it is specifically obvious that is an atrocious economic regime, but it has its perks. Europe is mostly socialist driven with some liberalism. See France, Italy and Germany. And they are the 3 economical pillars of the EU even though we have to assists at those embarrassing meetings where France and Italy gets other minor states to tell them what to do. In fact real taxation in Italy and France is between 60% to 70%. France shoots rockets into space and has more nuclear power plants than the rest of the EU together, they are cutting edge in virology.  I mean, nothing but fascism (and nazism) is truly evil as long as the people have a saying on it. Socialism is working as long as it is not the east of Europe way of interpreting it. Europe is already socialist. I mean, paying 1000 euro for one year of university, 98% free health care, 100% free school, cooperatives, etc ... 4 out of 8 G8 countries have always been strongly socialist. The EU is a union of democratic socialist state already. This is why EU does not progress as fast as China or USA. The EU decided civilization needs nurturing and time. And this cannot be done sacrificing or abusing others as it was done in the past or as they do in the USA or China. Everyone needs to be enabled and helped to express its power and productivity. And that is very socialist in my view. For instance I think the European Union must force those states that have not yet done so to have Golden Share on strategic companies that are also a national security concern like Gas/Oil, Telecom and military giant complex (as I actually believe already is in Italy, France and Germany). This is not the USA nor China. We can't go full liberal or full socialists like China even though it might boost us forward in certain area.

&gt;**Deutsch-Sowjetischer Nichtangriffsvertrag** ist die offizielle Bezeichnung durch die Signatarstaaten und ist im Bereich der Diplomatie des Zweiten Weltkrieges vorherrschend. In den Zeiten des Kalten Krieges war sie regional im sowjetischen und mittelosteuropäischen Raum gebräuchlich und Kritiker bemängelten diese Benennung impliziere einen friedlichen, nichtaggressiven Nichtangriffspakt mit der Leugnung des geheimen Zusatzprotokolls.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Molotow-Ribbentrop-Pakt** entwickelte sich in den Kreisen russischer und ostmitteleuropäischer Dissidenten und Emigranten und entwickelte sich im Kalten Krieg zu einem Kampfbegriff gegen das kommunistische System und die Sowjetunion, um den Vertrag und sein geheimes Zusatzprotokoll zu veröffentlichen und offen die Motive zum Abschluss des Vertrages zu diskutieren. Dabei wurden weder die diktatorischen Systeme noch die Diktatoren der Signatarstaaten benannt.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Hitler-Stalin-Pakt** und **Nazi-Soviet-Pact** sind ein Produkt des Kalten Krieges in der westdeutschen und angelsächsischen Publizistik.

2633,"Communism has been successful in the eyes of working class and poor people, not in the eyes of the rich. Although it has been successful, a few factors have made it especially hard for communism to reach its full potential.

Communism is international. Without a majority of the worlds economies operating under a socialist system, it will be difficult to run an economy based on “people over profit” as socialism tries to do.

Imperialism. This is probably the single biggest factor in preventing socialism from reaching its full potential. Throughout history, when a socialist revolution succeeds and the working class takes control of the government, the capitalist world intervenes with war. The U.S.A. has done this time and time again, Chile, Vietnam, Korea, Laos, Somalia, Burkina Faso, Cuba, Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Colombia, Venezuela just to name a few. Even when countries have successfully fought back against the U.S. war machine, they remain under economic attack i.e. sanctions (see Cuba, and Venezuela).

A final impediment to people viewing communism as being successful is poverty. Many critics of communism criticize it because most countries where revolutions have occurred have been poor. Poverty has nothing to do with the communist system! Poverty existed before the revolution, communism didn’t cause it. What socialism does is start the transition out of poverty.

Now, you’re probably wondering how communism has been successful for the poor and working class. I’ll give you a couple of examples.

**Thomas Sankara in Burkina Faso (President from: 1983–1987) Assassinated in a plot by the CIA.**

“He vaccinated 2.5 million children against meningitis, yellow fever and measles in a matter of weeks.

He initiated a nation-wide literacy campaign, increasing the literacy rate from 13% in 1983 to 73% in 1987.

He planted over 10 million trees to prevent desertification

He built roads and a railway to tie the nation together, without foreign aid

He appointed females to high governmental positions, encouraged them to work, recruited them into the military, and granted pregnancy leave during education.

He outlawed female genital mutilation, forced marriages and polygamy in support of Women’s rights

He sold off the government fleet of Mercedes cars and made the Renault 5 (the cheapest car sold in Burkina Faso at that time) the official service car of the ministers.

He reduced the salaries of all public servants, including his own, and forbade the use of government chauffeurs and 1st class airline tickets.

He redistributed land from the feudal landlords and gave it directly to the peasants. Wheat production rose in three years from 1700 kg per hectare to 3800 kg per hectare, making the country food self-sufficient.

He opposed foreign aid, saying that “he who feeds you, controls you.”

He spoke in forums like the Organization of African Unity against continued neo-colonialist penetration of Africa through Western trade and finance. • He called for a united front of African nations to repudiate their foreign debt. He argued that the poor and exploited did not have an obligation to repay money to the rich and exploiting

In Ouagadougou, Sankara converted the army’s provisioning store into a state-owned supermarket open to everyone (the first supermarket in the country).

He forced civil servants to pay one month’s salary to public projects.”

**Cuba: 1959-Present**. Achievements despite a 60 year U.S. blockade.

“Cuba provides free health care for its people. As a result, life expectancy for Cubans (79.13 years) is higher than for Americans (78.64 years).

There are 23 medical schools on the island, meaning Cuba has the highest doctor-to-resident ratio in the world (1:155).

Skilled doctors are sent to countries where they're needed, such as El Salvador, Haiti, Venezuela, and even the US.

Cuba spends 10% of its entire national budget on education. As a result, education is free for the whole population at all levels of advancement (including university tuition). School uniforms and meals are also free.

The Cuban literacy rate for over 15's is 99.8%. This is higher than in America (99.0%).

Class sizes in primary schools are kept below 25. Secondary schools have around 15 per class. A majority of teachers have more than 5 years of university education.”

2651,"Essentially, Sweden and Finland had the same pattern of the capitals being hit, but Finland closed Uusimaa while Sweden did not prohibit travel. The point I made earlier was that closing of Stockholm wouldn't have saved Stockholm, in the same way that closing Helsinki didn't help Helsinki. However, I am not convinced that closing Stockholm would have had a significant positive impact on the rest of the country either.

I do not agree that the message of social distancing was not conveyed to Swedish citizens. It was quite clear, and while a very small number of people may have ignored it, I believe that the media blew it way out of proportion. Mainly because the media, and people in general, wanted to shame the ones that did not conform.

I am a student in a student city. There were no parties here. Almost everyone from my program actually left the city to stay with their parents, and only came back last month. You could see small gatherings of students sitting in the park and having a beer together, maybe 3-4 kids per group and maybe four groups in total if you were ""lucky"". *Normally* the entire park would be completely packed and you'd need to set up festival fences so people wouldn't step on each other.

I don't believe that stopping these small gatherings would have had any impact on the outcome of the infection. And I particularly don't believe that stronger language would have made the difference. The same was reported in Norway, that responded by closing restaurants only to later realize that students were arranging parties at home in much more crowded and unsafe environments.

I also strongly disagree that issues like this should be politicized. The large mistake that Sweden has done in the past 30 years is to politicize crisis response. For example, we gave away 5000 ventilators from our field hospitals in the 90s. We have laughable food stores, and we essentially have no medicine stores at all, with everything supposedly arriving ""just in time"" outside of a crisis context. These matters must be addressed so that the civil government can respond to crises without the meddling of politicians that always need to think of their popularity.

In the same vein, I'd dread to see a politician try to mount a military response. In war time, I would want politicians to sit down and shut up, and have generals make the decisions.",Sweden,/r/europe/comments/ickkej/swedens_fauci_doubles_down_against_masks_as/g2k8win/,mirshafie,1598166726

2725,"&gt;There is no such thing as data rating racism.

Like with anything in sociology you can collect data relating to racism and there have been a number of studies

&gt;I've lived there a year, tho, so I speak from experience. As a white man from a western European country, I didn't count the time people there told me they were worried about the ongoing Asian invasion and how people like me should stay.

I've lived there a lot longer, I'd have to ask which part of Australia as it's a big place, like Europe or the USA there are areas that sound like what you experienced, i'm guessing rural queensland? but it's far from the norm. 

&gt;And I don't really blame them, some cities in the north are populated for 90℅+ by Asian. Some parts of the country are already de facto Asian.

no problem with this. 

&gt;What the Australians do not like are brown people, until A few decades ago, aboriginal people weren't even considered citizens in their own country.

This is not the typical view, you could say the same about Europe (especially as it's much much whiter) or the USA and it would be equally as true or false. the Aboriginal not being considered citizens before the vote in 1967 is a common myth: https://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/download/library/prspub/JTZM6/upload_binary/jtzm62.pdf

&gt;Only the people with the highest income, diplomas can fit a points-based system. It's segregation by money. It will / is going to backfire, tho because the only people really interested in moving in Australia aren't European or American but Asian.

You've used words like segragation and apartheid but now you seem to be saying that a points based system will lead to more asian / indian people rather than white people immigrating? is this a problem? your argument seems to have changed here.

&gt;Basically, you are, without realizing it, doing the opposite of what you actually want: getting more wealthy Asian buying out your country.

I don't know when i said what i want, so i don't know how you can know that's the opposite. If people want to integrate into Australian society and leave any political or racial baggage at the door i'm ok with that. 

&gt; For example, do you have any idea of the percentage of fertile land now belongs to the Chinese?

I don't off the top of my head but i believe less than the USA.

&gt;And if Australia grants FoM tomorrow to the UK, it's not going the white collars doing hundreds of thousands of pounds annually that will move there.
It will be those seeking a better life, which means most likely those with less money/education and guesses what? These people in the UK are mostly not white.

I'm confused you started by saying Australia is racist but now it seems like you're arguing it's not racist enough??

&gt; Have fun with the best from Londonistan. If you google for it, you'll find a massive protest in the UK chanting ""death to white pigs"" and the like. Anglo-saxon Freedom of speech, all that.

We have almost a million reserve personel, going into an EU army with our current conscription model would be absolutely dumb as we would have way more to lose than we are likely to gain, considering that an EU army would propably mean relocating a lot of the armed forces to split them more evenly across europe which would mean us having less people ready to go when shit hits the fan.

2829," &gt;I hear this a lot but I think the opposite is true, Any data you can find says the opposite.

There is no such thing as data rating racism. I've lived there a year, tho, so I speak from experience. As a white man from a western European country, I didn't count the time people there told me they were worried about the ongoing Asian invasion and how people like me should stay.

And I don't really blame them, some cities in the north are populated for 90℅+ by Asian. Some parts of the country are already de facto Asian.

And the richest people in Asia are buying all the land, properties, etc. Sydney is now one of the most expensive cities in the world when it was pretty cheap 20 years ago.


&gt;It's a small country in terms of population and there's a hard limit to how many people you can accept before you start stressing the existing infrastructure, I'd say we are constantly right up against that line. It's only hard because of the demand outstripping the amount of immigration Australia can sustain.

The Australian government wouldn't any problem whatsoever accepting millions of educated white people if it could. The country is mostly empty and there a lot of opportunities still there. 

What the Australians do not like are brown people, until
A few decades ago, aboriginal people weren't even considered citizens in their own country.

They were parked in shit town with nothing to do and no transportation to the rest of the countries. The list goes on, it was downright institutionalized racism and pretty much apartheid. 

&gt;Strong disagree, Points-based immigration is much fairer when you have limited places and need to make a choice on who can and can't immigrate. Not sure if you have a better idea. Since the introduction of the current system, we have only become more multicultural.

Only the people with the highest income, diplomas can fit a points-based system. It's segregation by money. It will / is going to backfire, tho because the only people really interested in moving in Australia aren't European or American but Asian.

Basically, you are, without realizing it, doing the opposite of what you actually want: getting more wealthy Asian buying out your country. 

For example, do you have any idea of the percentage of fertile land now belongs to the Chinese?

And if Australia grants FoM tomorrow to the UK, it's not going the white collars doing hundreds of thousands of pounds annually that will move there. 

It will be those seeking a better life, which means most likely those with less money/education and guesses what? These people in the UK are mostly not white.

Excerpt from a 1941 Australian Newspaper revealing the attempted deception: 

&gt;The whole of the Binnen Alster-the innermost of the two lakes in the heart of Hamburg-has been camouflaged by means of hugo floating rafts to represent a built-up area with a lay-out of street blocks, roads and canal running through. A replica of the Lombards Brucke Bridge, the vital road and rail connection between the Binnen Alster and the Aussen Alster, has been constructed about 600 yards north of the original bridge. This bridge is a link between the two Hamburg marshalling yards. The photograph on the left shows the Binnen Alster area before camouflage and on the right the same area covered with camouflage to represent a built-up area. It also shows the main Hamburg station with light toned ""roads"" painted across the top of it, the railway lines treated similarly and the camouflaged bridge.",Romania,/r/europe/comments/iews2x/aerial_images_of_hamburg_germany_during_wwii_the/g2jvxgl/,filosoful,1598155687

Edit: answered my own question. They are limestone, a very hard and solid rock. Now for the mind-blowing geo history:


“The range was formed by the folding resulting from the collision of the African and Eurasian plates. Nowhere in the Balkans have glaciers left so much evidence of erosion. After the Alps, these mountains are the most glaciated in Europe south of the Scandinavian ice sheet. They have very steep limestone slopes with abundant karst features. The Prokletije is a large, rugged, pathless range. It is one of the rare mountain ranges in Europe that has not been explored entirely.”

The big picture is that France can send forces all across the world, it directs operations on several continents, operation Barkhane covers more ground than several times the size of Turkey. It's militaro-industrial complex is one of the best in the world with it's weapons being sold around the world. It's soldiers are among the best with other armies lining up to train with them in their installations. France's economy and industry is also much larger than Turkey, so not only France produces it's own weapons but it can produce them in larger numbers where as your precious imported wank material would get blockaded by the larger french navy anyways.

That Germany used to be (decades ago!) a very bad player in the area of peace is of zero influence if the USA is good or horrible. Similarly, both Russia and the USA can be horrible at the same time as the USA. Pointing with your finger to things more than 100 (colonialisms) or 75v years (WW2) ago won't bring your point validity.

Germany will refuse the role of leadership in the US-style. No one asks really for it, and no one wants to be bullied. Not from Russia, not from China, not from Germany. And also not from the USA.

The German way for the last decades was the way of sane politicians and negotiations. Example: it was negotiations that reunited Germany, not US military power. Europe would have negotiated the atomic threat of Iran away. Our intelligence and even the IAEO confirmed that Iran stopped uran enrichment!!! But the US bully kid continued the sanctions, even increased them. They torpedoed the European negotiations. So the Iran didn't get any incentive of following the rules ... and here we have another case where the USA decreased global security. Also, in reality the US showed that they really didn't care about Iran atomic program, they used that just as an excuse... in reality they wanted to get rid of the Mullah theocrazy (intentional misspelling). And access to the oil perhaps.

In this 75 years you said your country did overturn regimes (even democratic ones!), invaded several countries, made false flag operations, tortured people, meddled with a lot of other countries internal things ... and still you claim you are the reason of 75 years of peace?

They do mental gymnastics, as in they call this the Roman Salute and supposedly it’s not Nazi, and yet use other Nazi symbolism. They also supposedly dislike Hitler, but love all his policies, except the one against Poles. So basically they seem to dream of an alternative reality where Hitler was, well Polish, and unlike Germany, Poland won the war. It’s all rather insane, and if you question one they will deny all, twist it or accuse you of something etc, but they do exist, and since neo-Nazi symbolism seems to be more and more akin to white supremacy and preserving white culture among current followers, they are finding it easier to do mental gymnastics. Poland has a strict law on symbolism though, almost as strict as Germany, which is why they can’t publicly use the swastika etc, though some extreme ones have very weird tattoos, but if they could, well, some weirdos would. The main guy in the photo seems a likely candidate to be extreme like that.

2967,"Corona is more widespread and more tests are being carried out. A few weeks ago, positive test rate was 0.6% even though most restrictions had been removed. Now, positive test rate is 1.0% despite a significantly increased number of tests.

Furthermore, a few weeks ago, many of the positive tests were due to local outbreaks, such as in meat processing plants. This kind of outbreak can be traced and contained relatively easily. Just test everybody working at that factory, everybody who attended that one church service or wedding. Back then, about a third of German administrative districts had exactly zero positive tests. But currently, corona is almost everywhere in Germany, only a handful of districts had no positive tests the last week.

That much said, on a state level, the number of positive tests correlates strongly with the summer school break. In states where the school break is already over, the number of positive tests has started to decrease again. In states where the summer school break started late July, the numbers only started to increase second week of August. Thus, we know that the biggest reason for the increased numbers is people returning infected from their summer vacation, plus people infected by those people.

Hospitalization actually are a poor measure, as they trail actual infections by about 3-6 weeks. The people who are going on vacation to parts of the world where the numbers are high, and then behave carelessly while on such a vacation, tend to be young and healthy. They are unlikely to end up hospitalized. When they get back infectuous, they might infect more people in their group of friends, again people who are biased towards the young. Only slowly will the infection chains move to the old, the people with pre-existing conditions, the people who are more likely to end up being hospitalized.",,/r/europe/comments/ieqpjz/germany_worried_as_coronavirus_cases_return_to/g2jh8l0/,RidingRedHare,1598146347

2985,"&gt;What you like is an image of success as understood in the cultural hegemony of the USA: low density suburb with a SUV and a golden retriever. Moreover, the model of low density semidetached McMansions you are proposing is what is producing global warming through an intensive used of car, long commutes as public transport requires a critic mass of population density, loss of untouched habitats pressuring wild animals (Covid, anyone?), social isolation and reduction of quality in health, increase in consumption and material for infrastructure, more surface covered means more run off and heat island effect.

What are you even talking about? You didn't even read what I have written, buddy. I have some serious doubts about your ability to comprehend a written text. You are literally arguing against *the same thing* I argue against.

Nowhere did I advocate for a detached sub-urbian McMansions. In fact, I vitriolically detest them - they represent the complete opposite of what I think is the healthy urban environment should be.  The dense cities of old were self-sustaining, occupied a minimal natural footprint and provided the most enjoyable environment for the life to thrive. This is something we should thrive for if we want to build a proper urban environment of today.

But you don't understand where do McMansions come from in the first place. The sub-urbia is a descendant of the [Garden City Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_city_movement), the position that decried the very existence of the city, and was eager to replace it with the endless rows of semi-detached houses. Modernist doctrine took on this relay race - the main position of CIAM manifesto on the New City was that *density was bad* - thus the dense cities were to be replaced with rows of sub-urbia and long-distance car-oriented traffic. Blocks such as Walden7 are **not meant to provide density** - they are [meant to stay apart surrounded by the parking lots and highways](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d8/Plan_Voisin_model.jpg). One of the purposes of these blocks were in class segregation - rich would be living in their sub-urban villas, while the poor would inhabit the blocks - thus they would not meet in one urban environment, because all the movement was designed around the car. The traditional city environments provide a dense and interconnected urban fabric, where all amenities, work and entertaiment are reachable by foot. The properly designed and beautiful architecture is meant to stay for ages, not be replaced every decade, thus considerably improving sustainability.

Furthermore you also seem to be lost on what I was even saying about aesthetics. Of course much of the aesthetic preference is learned. That's the point - the architects are indoctrinated in schools to love an aesthetics (beauty) that is completely alien to the general public. Therefore they design buildings that are not beautiful to the people that live in them. In any way, the modern psychology already uncovers that there is an objective aesthetic preference that is in common in all humans - [an innate love for natural forms and materials](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272494418305280), regardless of class, ethnicity and cultural background. Unfortunately, many of the ""award-winning"" designs are built upon the concepts of beauty that are a complete opposite to what is natural to a human.",The other Galicia,/r/europe/comments/iecxdz/walden_7_building_barcelona_spain/g2jixz8/,Strydwolf,1598147369

3169,"&gt; But you know so much better.

Well of course I do, or rather, of course YOU don't. The very basic mistake you've made is to conflate aesthetics with science. Yes, we listen to experts when the subject is something which can be empirically proven - e.g. the safety of a medicine, the efficiency of an engine etc. What you've got muddled up with is OPINION. So, no, I don't believe the opinion of a music journalist about which is the best album of the last 10 years is any more (or less) valid than mine. No, I don't believe that a literary critic should decide which novels are better than others. It's just their opinion but certainly utterly different to listening to the advice of an experienced, highly qualified medical doctor. 

The point I was making is that the *opinion* of architects about what constitutes an aesthetically beautiful building is largely at odds with the *opinion* of what most non-architects believe constitutes an aesthetically beautiful building.

3335,"While I agree that military service gives you memories for life and adds a new perspective, I can't fully agree with the ""boys transform to men"".

For example, I don't really see how spending weeks in the forest would help you in your later life, other than reminding of how much we depend on modern amenities. Starting an independent life is so much more important and relevant. In the army, it's often the opposite – you are fed, you are housed, you are told what to do. Besides, the command structure is very different and restrictive compared to the debate-based society we are used to.

I also didn't feel like the discipline would be carried over to your later life. I mean, I sure as hell am not waking up at 6 in the morning every day to go outside and do morning exercise. I am also not bothering to use some really annoying official addressing based on ranks and titles which I find excessive.

Military service does give an insight into what kind of men there are in the country, so you'll get out of your social bubble and meet all kinds of fellows. It also gives you this default topic which you can discuss with most men in your country. Of course, it gives you some basic military education. But yes, it's difficult at times and you'll be glad to have made it together, and at times it's even fun to shoot with different guns.

Oh, and here, you can't trade it with college or anything. Even those who go to university must serve.

3459,"So Spain statistics on disposable income are precise and accurate? So what? That was not my point. My point was that when you do international comparison, you can’t just use what each country declares in its own dataset because definition and means of collection can change across borders so you are comparing things that have the same name but aren’t exactly the same. That’s why international bodies like eurostat or the OECD have statisticians whose job it is to normalize data across borders. For instance, one rather famous example is that GDP can, depending on which country provides the data, include illegal dealings or not, which would skew comparisons by a lot. That is why your method is not rigorous when dealing with international comparison.

Then about your argument about PPA and PPS. You can think however you want. Unfortunately, it doesn’t change the fact that trying to compare standards of living between countries without taking into account purchasing powers is laughable. You simply have to look at how people living at the border of two countries behave in their purchase to see that is not a valid way to compare incomes.

3507,"I don't think he wants the alt-right to take over any European country, but to create division. This is probably why the Kreml is so eager to support any extremists movement in Europe.


In Finland many different extremist groups seem to have some connections to the Kreml through the so-called [Finnish Anti-Fascist Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnish_Anti-Fascist_Committee), also known as SAFKA. The chairperson Johan Bäckman works for the Russian propaganda machine, and he is the leading Putinist in Finland. Through SAFKA he has managed to connect Finnish nazis, communists and Islamists.  


Leena Hietanen is a founding member of SAFKA. She seems to be an old-school Stalinist. She hates Finland and the Baltics, and she adores the Soviet Union. Here are some funny quotes: 

* *""When you go to Estonia, you understand why the Russians all Estonians and Finns ""Chukhnas"". You see, the defining feature of the Chuhkna is its incredible stupidity.""*

* *""Journalist Kirsikka Morning who writes about culture for the Helsingin Sanomat mocked Russia's attempts to use a new law to punish those who distort history. While writing her article ""Russia teaches history to its neighbours"" Moring did not yet realise, that this law means that journalists like Moring will go to prison.""*

* *""Remember these names: Jukka Lindsted and Stiina Löytömäki. When the Russian truth commission begins its work, those Finns who re-write history and rehabilitate nazis will be taken away to serve their five years prison sentence.""*

* *""I must confess that I liked Osama bin Laden.""*

-


Risto Tammi is another prominent member of SAFKA. By his own admission he is a former KGB informant. However, in 2007 he suddenly converted to Islam, changed his name to Abdullah, and found the Islamic party of Finland. It was an extremist group which supported shariah law, but it was also curiously anti-Russian. Members of the Islamic Party even arranged protests against books by Sofi Oksanen, because they portrayed the Soviet occupation of Estonia in a bad light. However, at some point the party was hijacked by actual islamists. There was a big fight concerning Chechnya, and the Islamists ended up expelling the Putinists including Abdullah Tammi. He immediately lost his faith and founded a communist party called *Punakaarti* (Red Guards).

-

Then there's Ilja Janitskin who died this spring. As far as I know, he was not a member of SAFKA, but he was an associate of Johan Bäckman. He was a members of Bandidos motorcycle gang, and the owner of MV-lehti, which was the largest alt-right fake news website in Finland. MV-lehti was supported by the illegal neo-nazi movement SVL. When an SVL protestor kicked a passer-by, causing him to hit his head and die, MV-lehti celebrated this incident writing that ""the street was stained with the Red Guard's blood"". MV-lehti also helped Johan Bäckman organise a smear campaign against journalist Jessikka Aro who was one of the first to report on Kremlin troll farms. In the end Bäckman was convicted of defamation and Janitskin was convicted of 16 different offences. MV-lehti has since been banned for criminal content.

Which it is. Capitals and the regions around them can benefit significantly from their status.

&gt; The EU's presence in Brussels has created significant social and economic impact. Jean-Luc Vanraes [nl], member of the Brussels' Parliament responsible for the city's external relations, goes as far to say the prosperity of Brussels ""is a consequence of the European presence"". As well as the institutions themselves, large companies are drawn to the city due to the EU's presence. In total, about 10% of the city has a connection to the international community.[53]
In terms of demographics, 46% of the population of Brussels is from outside Belgium;[54] of this, half is from other EU member states. About 3/5 of European Civil Servants live in the Brussels-Capital Region with 63% in the municipalities around the European district (24% in the Flemish Region and 11% in the Walloon Region).[55] Half of civil servants are home owners. The institutions draw in, directly employed and employed by representatives, 50,000 people to work in the city. A further 20,000 people are working in Brussels due to the presence of the institutions (generating €2 billion a year) and 2000 foreign companies drawn into the city employ 80,000 multilingual locals.[56]",,/r/europe/comments/ie8d8m/european_budget_2019_map/g2gljo9/,DarthRoach,1598101098

* the US president had a private vendatte with a cruel dictator
* the US intelligence services fabricated evidence. Other intelligence services said the ""witness"" is lunatic and not to believed. But due to policital circumstances the USA just continued with this made-up weapons of mass destruction lie
* the US attacked Iraq (btw, freeing Kuwait is something entirely different, I'm not discussing it)
* the US create a territory where for more than 10 years no real power existed (might vacuum)
* It created a terrority with lots of civil unrest, turmoil, and killings.
* in this might vaccum religious weirdheads did prosper. So in a way the actions of the USA is responsible for the raise of the IS
* while killing 10'000 civilists by themselves, the USA created a situation that did cost at least [500'000 deaths](https://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/us-studie-500-000-iraker-starben-im-irak-krieg-1.1795930). Sorry, but this is more than even the cruel Saddam would have killed
* the IS and the other islamistic groups in Iraq spread to Syria
* in Syria, another cruel dictator were, and so the religious opposition that the US grew in Iraq fell on fertile ground. So for sure the US isn't solely responsible what happened in the Syria, but a part of the problem there is on the USA for sure.
* lots of people from Iraq and Syria fled the country. Many to Jordan and Lebanon (and they now have a very defunct economy), but also to Europe. And as a result there is a (limited amount) of civil unrest in various europen countries as well.

My experience in the public school in Majorca was very good. The school offered special catalan lessons for migrants, so I was talking the language in less than a year.

Co-official languages are important for social life and inclusion, but not a 100% must (although very recommended). Regional governments offer a lot of tools for learning them (both for adults and children).

3734,"Many things were different:

1. We closed the border (Sweden still complain about Finland closing the border with you, while in Finland strict quarantine rules are not even debated). We even closed travel from Helsinki which have had 73 % of corona cases. Thanks to this many areas never really had a spread to worry about. Quarantine has been used since forever, the whole point of a quarantine is to stop big unpredictable events as the plague or the Spanish disease. You can't use math or science here, because by default we don't have any data on highly unlikely events. Instead the principle of precaution and ""common sense"" won the debate in Finland. 
2. The language/tone coming out from Sweden was completely different than in Finland. I follow SVT closely and they treated corona as something controllable. In Finland some people actually forgot they have a right to leave the country, that is how strongly the government advised against travell. 
3. The Swedish government did not take any leadership in this question. Corona is a political question in Finland due to the inherent unpreditability of a disease. I don't think you can really change much by being more authoritarian. In the end you can't micromanage people. But there is definitelly place for a government to coordinate action. In Sweden the question was left to non-politicans, which is very weird to me, as diseases and wars are probably the most loaded political questions you can have. 
4. As a consequence the attitude by the population was completely different. I know from friends parties were arranged at student cities almost daily during corona. The space people keep between each other was way safer in Finland. You can't reasonable stop a disease to get into elderly home when it is widespread in society. The only way to save elderly is by stopping the spread in the 1st place. 

This is not to say the Finnish repsonse have been good. It has in fact been very flawed. Masks were only just recently recommended a few days ago. The very same general ideas getting favour in Sweden, was also close to winning over academics in Finland too. We missed the outbreak in China, and acted way to late as we received information about the outbreak. We even had an isolated case coming into Finland that was stopped very early.

Also France did a great job of killing most of their regional languages, resulting in neighboring regions of France all speaking French rather early on, and by diffusion this happened in Switzerland as well.

3747,"Of course every world power was built on injustice. The world and especially the past were a hostile shithole none of us would want to live in today. But this changes nothing about OUR misdemeanors. What puts me off though is the desire of so many people to turn back the decades to 'better times'. Right now we are at our freest and wealthiest so far. 

As I said there is nothing special about christianity that should make us believe it contributed to our freedom and wealth today more than any other religion would have to their societies. All religions are an obstacle to social and scientific progress because of their conservative nature and tendency to accumulate power, corruption and wealth. If you compare all the positive contributions of religion against all the negative crimes commited in its name, any religion's change to the world is next to zero. What matters more is the deeds of the individual people that justify their actions with religion anyway. I'd also take a wild guess that if you were born a muslim you'd support an illiberal islamic society instead of a christian one. 

The wealth Europeans benefit from until this day was raided from the rest of the world by our ancesters over the centuries and in one way or another the exploitation still continues. Religion did play some role in that, because the institutions of power and religion were interwined from the start. But again there is nothing special about Christianity that wouldn't make it interchangeable with any other religion in its place. What stands in the Bible and what you call your gods changes nothing about how a person would behave in the midst of its social environment and structures of power.

The freedoms Europeans benefit from today were invented and fought for by free thinkers all across the nations, religions and centuries. That fight was directed against the structures of power, thus either directly or indirectly against religion. The battle of ideas was first ignited in the scriptoriums of the church since it had a monopoly on writing and research. But science has come to contradict religion, and philosophy has overcome it. Not because they changed the church's dogmas but the minds of too many people whom the church had to give in to. I can't give you an answer as to why this happened HERE, because free thought could give rise to freedom just about anywhere. There where very liberal and scientifically litterate societies before, but war and religion where among the reasons that that progress was lost.

One thing for sure is that Orban's christian illiberal society is a massive step back in time. The word 'christian' wants to associate it with long living tradition, a safe and happy place, simpler times. But those simpler times never existed. The word 'illiberal' means intolerant, especially towards religious and sexual minorities. For some reason it is too much to ask for different people to have the freedom to live their life differently.

3800,"What would it be for? The EU's defence is already guaranteed by EU countries and therefore NATO. Unless you wanted to start intervening in other countries which, based on the response to a lot of military interventions in the past thirty years, wouldn't be popular
Would that mean that all aspects of weapons and the military become part of the EU military? Cause then you get the issue of France's nukes and whether the other nuclear powers are happy with France sharing its nuclear responsibility

Personally it needs a reason, if Russia becomes more aggressive then go right ahead, if the EU decides it wants to become a global power like the US but less American then be my guest.

As to PiS and the EU, I am not sure what we should want on that front. The EU is an organization that was built by and for the member states, we might be EU citizens, but our states and their governments are the medium through which the EU interacts with us. 

On lots of levels that is fine, our states generally work and there is no need to reinvent the wheel, or force some universal government model on the whole group, but that does limit the EU's capability to intervene with domestic politics. It is even unclear if the EU has a mandate to overrule election results, particularly if the votes were counted fairly. If we had imposed sanctions on PiS Poland, wouldn't they have simply gone to the ECJ and argued that the sanctions were intervening with the operation of the single market and won?

3898,"&gt; If Germany and France decided to back the U.S. in one of their bs interventions again everyone else would be dragged into it.

Germany and France have 175 MEPs. A majority is 353. So simply placing the army under parliamentary control, like any serious proposal does, solves this concern. (Even if we end up with a system that aportions MEPs by unmodified population directly, they still have only ~ 1/3 of the population between them) Additionally, if you consider the council as the upper house of the legislature, and require its consent for millitary missions as well, this issue is adressed even more.

&gt;Plus if we have a giant unified military it will embolden us to start unnecessary crap with Russia.

Having an army in no way implies wanting to use it. Armies continue to exist, yet countries aren't generally at war even with countries they can beat easily anymore. War is chiefly a moral consideration these days, not a utilitarian one.

Further, we do ought to be more assertive against Russia. People have been killed by Russian operatives on European soil, and Ruassia has invaded an annexed a part of Ukraine. Ignoring that out of a noble, yet overzealous, sense of pacifism would be foolish.

3924,"&gt;we can't rely on my moral understanding or yours because they can change time to time. That's why I think an unchangeable moral understanding is better, even necessary.

When it comes to religious morality, is it really the unchanging nature that makes it appealing, or the universality of a morality that exists above individuals?

To me, it feels like something changing over time doesn't make it unserviceable - trains and cars change over time, but are still useful as they are, likewise I expect my morality to change with time, but does that really make my current morality non-useful? It may not be perfect, but as long as it approximates or approaches the ideal, then I am not overly concerned with a few rough edges. Similarly a car may break down or have dents, but that doesn't immediately make it useless.

From my perspective, the most appealing thing about religious morality is the lack of subjectivity. Where right and wrong may change from person to person, a single source of morality allows a certain guarantee that people’s behaviour will conform to a specific standard. The question for me then becomes ""how to we know which standard is the right standard?"", which is a far more important question if we work under the assumption that the standard may never change afterwards.

&gt;so we can start with asking basic questions like “How did all start? Is there a Creator? If there's then does the Creator want something for us and why did Creator create us?""

Speaking personally, I am not unwilling to believe that there may be a force that created this universe, but where I tend to deviate from this line of logic is that I remain unconvinced of any specific intentions or guidelines set down by a creator. To me, it’s not a simple matter of ""what makes the most sense from my perspective?"", instead the question is ""How can I know that any specific doctrine is actually more true than any other, regardless of how much sense it makes to me?""

The internet did that, English has by far the highest amount of total speakers(when we count non native). Almost all international academic papers are in English. And NATO speaks, You guessed it English.

3951,"Here's a few attempts at answering this from a layman living in Europe:

- Size will most likely be a cost/effectiveness discussion, but it will most likely be less than all of the EU's armies combined, because there's less borders to protect. Maybe the size of Russia's army? I don't have the numbers right now, butt hose are two potential bookmarks.

- Equipment standardisation was already one of the aims in NATO, but the US shot that to hell when they decided to adopt the M14 instead of the FAL in the 50s. There's no reason to not pick that back up. NATO standard munitions, approval of a selection of small arms instead of just one, but with compatible ammo and accessory attachments if possible, to be phased into one weapon of each category as needed a generation or two later. Create multinational R&amp;D (like what was also tried between France and Germany in the 50s) for as many aspects as needed, or try to decide on who gets the contracts on a case by case basis, like already happens, even across the borders. 

- Nukes will be a topic. I would suggest France taking the responsibility of using her nukes to protect all of Europe ONLY in a defensive case. This might actually be the strategy.

- Restricting the army to only defense by design is unnecessary. I propose a 60% majority decision for actions outside the EU's borders, with a few exceptions, like the fact that France is still supporting its former colonial nations in Africa, and some other countries might too. There should be ongoing contingents ready for that, because I support that cause and as far as I know it always happens with the consent of said former colonies.

In reality, the north is using ""beggar thy neighbour"" fiscal policies which are literally bankrupting the south because it's simply not productive enough. No solidarity had been seen whatsoever at all towards the south. All solidarity had been towards the east for cohesion, but the south is actually a net donor, not a receiver. And the bailouts? The money from the bailouts went back to the north, not to the south. And that's not to mention the lack of solidarity when it comes to the migrants, which you just left the already strained financially south (strained by you) to deal with completely alone. Then there's the lack of solidarity when Covid came, of course. I loved seeing all that help Italy and Spain got from the north. Oh, wait, that didn't happen. 

In fact, the south just got its first and only real solidarity in the form of the grants they're going to receive which are WOEFULLY inadequate compared to all the money you've syphoned away through the last two decades.

So either they specialize in just a few specific types of forces which are integrated smartly in a larger international structure, or they give money that goes to the budget of a coherent EU army.

But regardless of that shouldn't every country that agreed to 2% still try to work towards that goal? Many EU countries either aren't going to reach that goal by the deadline or aren't even trying.

No country owes money to the US, yes, but they do owe it to themselves to make sure the EU as a bloc is prepared for any military action that may affect them.

And it's also the image of cooperation.

Members have however agreed to a commitment to reach 2% of GDP on military spending by 2024. Ok so many are not on track and it's 2020 but you cannot compare a small nation who's only goal in NATO is to protect itself and Europe to the USA directly. The USA is a globally reaching power and it's military spending is for more than just NATO and self defence. Anyway America spends around 3.4% of GDP on military spending.

No nations owe back payments to America through NATO, this is a myth.

IF we only use % of GDP as a measure, we take that Russia spends 3.8% of GDP on military spending which looks higher than the USA but obviously that is peanuts compared to the overall USA militaries budget in US dollars, it spends over 10x more. Russia has a lower GDP overall than the USA, so GDP as a measure of military spending is not an apples to apples comparison. For example Saudi Arabia spends spends over 8% of GDP on military spending but it actually only spends slightly less than Russia.

France, the UK and Germany actually spend roughly the same in billions of US dollars (give or take a few billion) on military spending overall.

The fact that muslims wear traditional clothes in the UK and not in Germany is quite surprising to me. Both have quite large muslim populations and I think Germany's is a bit larger.

Maybe I'm just used to smaller/medium sized cities.

Thinking about it now, I think that muslims wear thobes and such less in Germany since a vast majority of muslims in Germany are Turks, where such clothing is a bit less common. Also not sure how long most of the muslims have lived in the UK but most of the Turkish people in Germany are 3rd Generation immigrants and in my experience traditional clothing is one of the things a lot of people would phase out the quickest when moving to another country. Wearing traditional clothing might also not have been viewed as acceptable when most of them came here in the 60's. As I mentioned, my family mostly wears traditional stuff to sleep.

In that case as cruel as it might be we must simply secure our borders and help those struggling African communities locally by funding free media, education and local opportunities - This will save far more lives than allowing unchecked migration that will destroy not only destroy European countries and also cause countless people to die on hopeless journeys to Europe in which 2-3 in 100 people make it only to get to Europe and get stuck in a refugee camp or a ghetto.
2000 years ago people migranting needed to build some huts on their new lands and survive by hunting and taking care of some cattle. Today they need to find their place in an extremely complex economy - something locals struggle with even after 15 years of local education. 
The proper way to immigrate is to first see if there is a place for you in the receiving economy or to put it simply whether or not you will be able to make yourself useful to the local population so that they can pay you money for it. Without this there is no difference between Europe and Africa, its a life of poverty and crime in a ghetto either way, but at least in Africa there is opportunity for growth.

In Afganistan and Iraq for example we would act as a stablizing force in the first place helping the state hold fair elections and keep the peace while investing in rebuilding projects, funding free media and education.

A little more information from the [American Anthropological Association](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/24714378/ns/us_news-gut_check/t/s-s-immigration-defining-whiteness/)

&gt;The arguments, outlined in Madison Grant's 1916 book The Passing of a Great Race, held that older immigrants were skilled, thrifty, hardworking like native born Americans and recent immigrants from southern and eastern Europe were unskilled, ignorant, predominantly Catholic or Jewish and not easily assimilated into American culture.

&gt;Madison Grant and Charles Davenport, among other eugenicists, were called in as expert advisers on the threat of ""inferior stock"" from eastern and southern Europe, playing a critical role as Congress debated the Immigration Act of 1924.

A foundation on peace, freedom, equality, justice, tolerance and solidarity are the best characteristics of that. Those don't end at our own doorstep, at our family, at our country's borders or anywhere else. They are universal which supposedly is what differentiates us from animals.

It should come to no surprise that most researchers of that age were clerics, nobility or both.

That being said, I do think we learned from Iraq (Afghanistan was justified). We pulled back from a major intervention in Syria and the Russians filled the vacuum, which is fine. And we let Europe take the lead in Libya, really only providing logistical support behind the scenes. As bad as Trump is, he has pulled US troops out of the region over the last 4 years.

4428,"Right, because language/dialect/accent does such a poor job of that. Especially in the countryside where people were always familiar with who lives in their nearby villages anyways.

Folk clothing probably had more to do with who people talked about fashion and aesthetics with the most often. You talked about it most with the people whose language you share, who you go to church with, who you exchange fairy tales with, who you spent the day laboring with.

Not to mention that cultural exchanges were always happening and existed. Most of the ethnic groups of europe didn't independently come to the conclusion that plants are for men and skirts are for women. They've always influenced each other.

Not that clothing and identity are totally disjoint, they're obviously related. Its equally likely that some other metric of identity besides ethnicity influences it, however. It could be ""everyone in my family has a specific embroidery on their jackets, everyone told me it's the prettiest design and grandma made it up so I'll wear it too"" or ""I'm proud of my village so I'll wear what they're wearing too"" rather than ""I don't speak X so I won't wear their embroidery.""",,/r/europe/comments/idspt1/ethnic_groups_of_bukovina_region_austriahungary/g2cqyi1/,IceNeun,1598035673
4429,"&gt; There aren't national, cultural, and linguistic barriers for NATO

There sure are. 

Chiefly, in terms of funding commitment and genuine hardware readiness.

Norway and Denmark are developed countries, and wealthy countries, but Norways GDP is about 400 Billion.

Germany's is about 4 _Trillion_.

Germany is _ten Norways_ in terms of productive output.  It has 80 million people. Norway has 5 million.

There are distributions of IQ, age structure, etc. that are comparable, but here's the rub: Germany has more cash, more people, and ought have an easier time in turning out 'fighter and bomber pilots who can kill things, from planes they're flying'.

When it came to the NATO no-fly zone mission  in Libya, one which **every** alliance member voted for, and which was also approved by the UN Security council:

Norway and Denmark provided just over 10% of strike capable aircraft.

They hit a *third* of the targets. 

France was left dropping training bombs in the hopes they'd harm tanks, because they straight up ran out of Ordnance. 
https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2011/04/france-dropping-non-explosive-bombs-libya/350160/#:~:text=French%20planes%20have%20started%20dropping,kills%20a%20lot%20of%20people.

Germany _abstained_ entirely from combat operations, and it is not clear that its air force _could_ actually interoperate with NATO forces.


I am not saying this just to dunk on Europeans, but think of it this way:

Russia is not goatherders and absconded-with-tanks rebels in Libya.

China is effectively a peer military to the US.

It is _probably not the case_ that any European NATO member now would be able to defend itself without US intervention from across the Atlantic against Russia. It is _probably not the case_ that any European NATO member would be able to assist in the case of US war with China, both things in which article 5 would be invoked.

This is after **decades** of the US pushing for more spending, uniformity in equipment, and genuine interoperability in capacity between allied nations sworn to protect one another in the event of military conflict with non-NATO members.

&gt;Liberia began as a settlement of the American Colonization Society (ACS), who believed black people would face better chances for freedom and prosperity in Africa than in the United States.[6] The country declared its independence on July 26, 1847. The U.S. did not recognize Liberia's independence until February 5, 1862, during the American Civil War. Between January 7, 1822, and the American Civil War, more than 15,000 freed and free-born black people who faced legislated limits in the U.S., and 3,198 Afro-Caribbeans, were relocated to the settlement. The settlers carried their culture and tradition with them. The Liberian constitution and flag were modeled after those of the U.S. On January 3, 1848, Joseph Jenkins Roberts, a wealthy, free-born African American from Virginia who settled in Liberia, was elected Liberia's first president after the people proclaimed independence.

There's the crux of the issue, neither candidate checks those boxes.

Trump is 100% a narcissist, but from what I've seen of Biden he certainly thinks very highly of himself as well, and gets really (almost irrationally) aggressive towards people who disagree or question him (see lying dogfaced pony-soldier video or the steel worker video). Finally neither candidate is supporting healthcare for all. Biden only supports Obamacare, which has been a disaster and a horrible way to try and help those in need.

4608,"&gt;all of it has Christian stamp on it

Nothing of that had christian stamps on it. These freedoms were often fought for, aquired with great personal risks, against the church.

In the 15th century the protest revolution even caused a split in the church and massivly weakend it both in real power but also in it's authority. THAT is the reason why so many other developments could take place.

&gt;There is zero corelation between technological advancement and losing ""foothold"" by the church.

Right mate, sure. Whatever floats your boat.

&gt;The reason why Islam eventually stopped technological advancement of  muslim states and Christianity didn't do the same with Europe is not  that Europeans ""overpowered"" religion (because they didn't). The reason  is in Christianity itself. Everything what today is threat for further  development, like marxist and neo-communist ideologies, are direct  opposition to Christianity.

Then please explain to me why in the 1000 years from 500 to 1500, when the church WAS the dominant force in Europe, the continent also saw it's darkest time.

Islam and Christianity are the same things. Superstition for ""simple"" people who can't explain how the world works, used and abused by more intelligent people who knew how to use religion to gain power. A force that hinders progression and foresight, and did so for millenia. Even today, look at the church. Pedophilia wherever you look, in all kind of countries, protected by superiours. THAT is your religion. 

And you see it here with your comments, too. You are a chrisitan. That means you lie, you distort the truth, you ignore facts and prefer faith. Your argument here is a perfect example of that, given you try to spin even history showing christianity as the source of light in Europe, while in fact it was responsible for the longest period of darkness in european history.

In the end, you sound just like a Muslim when he tries to defend Islam. And just like a Muslim trying to defend the history of his religion, you get the same treatment in return.

I explained why I felt that way in the next sentence. Pretty much everybody in government seems to think they have blank checks and that's OK but then blame the other side for doing the same.

&gt;""Maybe, I'm only 24 but so far life's been pretty good and Capitalism has served me well."" Who is arguing to move away from Capitalism? Do you think Germany is not capitalist? Sweden? Denmark? No major party is advocating moving away from capitalism.

Sorry about that, most people who use the ""leopards ate my face"" thing seem to be honestly extremely anti-capitalist. Especially on sites like this I have seen a marked uptick in self described Marxists/Communists and its crazy to me because it has failed every time it has been tried.

&gt;Expanding social welfare programs which are ALREADY successful. Do you realize that American seniors have one of (if not the best) health outcomes IN THE WORLD (for seniors)? US healthcare is AMAZING, but it's out of reach for so many Americans.

&gt;Why do we have the army? To protect ourselves. Why do we have fire service? To protect us. So why not close the gap and go to the source - protect our people by providing healthcare. We have the money. We already spend WAY more per person.

I agree we absolutely need to reform our health insurance system. I do have a problem with asking for more money to do so when we already spend more money than anybody else on it. We need to be more efficient (and yes some of that efficiency comes from socialization), not just throwing money at everything coming and going.

&gt;You're concerned about yourself and yourself only. This is what has gotten us into the mess.... If I saw you on the street and you were in need of help, I'd help you. I wouldnt be concerned about how much time it will cost me, or if my hands would get dirty.

I am concerned about myself and my family yes, but I also think that increased economic activity will benefit everyone as well. Im not some sociopath getting off on peoples suffering, and I would help you as well if I saw you in need in the street.

&gt;There's no possibility of civil discourse with people who think Biden is just as bad as Trump.

4723,"well, 90% of r/europe's pessimism about turkey comes from ignorance and circlejerk, for example, you're reading into turkish society and politics over a single poll result.

first of all, hagia sophia has been a mosque for about 500 years, it's not like a church converted into a mosque, it was a mosque that was converted into a museum converted back to a mosque again. it's a stupid thing to do, but was a result of pure derperation, since they've been tanking in the polls for quite a while.

that 60% aren't radical islamists, not even close, do you even know what a country with 60% of its population are radical islamists would look like? they're muslims who see hagia sophia as a mosque, more than that, the greatest symbol of the conquest, and they cannot make sense of it being a museum and their reaction is nationalistic rather than religious. that doesn't mean they want all the churches to be converted into mosques, lol, vast majority of the mosques are empty in istanbul, erdogan himself has always used the argument that they have no reason to convert hagia sophia into mosque since blue mosque is always empty, sitting about 200m across, against those who wanted hagia sophia to be converted. now he did it because he's desperate, and he's simply trying to hang on to his more conservative core since he has no hope left gaining trust of others.

chp doesn't need and doesn't get any votes from conservatives(let alone ""radical islamists"") so they won't need their support to stay in power, should they win the elections in the first place. iyi parti on the other hand, which is a party supported by urbanized, more secular nationalists, is still growing with the votes they gain from akp and mhp, and they're likely to become the major power in the next 5 years.

with radical islamist ideas, the largest percentage of the votes you'll ever get in turkey is about .5%, which is still scary, but nothing like what you think.

as the hype of hagia sophia diminishes, there'll be nothing that keeps the government converting it back to a museum again.",,/r/europe/comments/ids9y9/after_hagia_sophia_turkey_converts_another/g2bj6lb/,theruwy,1598014018

ah yes Mickiewicz work when he started his most famous piece by saying ""Lithuania, my fatherland"" Like i said before and i will repeat again, Crown and GDL were one entity only after Constitution of May 3 which happend moments before partition. Both Polish crown and GDL had more freedom in administration than EU member states now. Its like calling whole European Union  - Germany. 
The move to try to introduce common background was done by introducing some shitty sarmatian identity which would in theory include both nobilities and it was done precisely because Lithuanians didnt forsake their indentity in favour of polish one at that time and only adopted part of culture.
The fact that Lithuanian nobility were accepted under polish coat of arms doesnt make them polish nobility only give them the same rights as szlachta.. Dont get me started about peasants who couldnt care less what they are called as long as they were left alone, ludzie tutejsi.. not poles..

NATO doesn’t actually have rules on NATO entry beyond all NATO members must approve entry. While I agree that an ongoing conflict might make some NATO members (particularly those who have been in a process of disarmament) less likely to approve Ukrainian entry that isn’t the same thing as an actual rule. 

The EU is a similar situation. It doesn’t have rules that forbid it from offering membership to states with ongoing conflicts. The EU’s language on collective defense is notoriously vague and noncommittal; per the written statement, members are not actually required to go to war to defend each other.

Understanding that it does means you accept that things are gray in everything, complex everywhere, and that power will always be a factor in every interaction, moreso at the level of the states than anywhere else. So while it would be nice if we could all join hands and sing Kumbaya, that is merely the thoughts of a cretin, not a healthy reflection of reality. It's also propaganda serving the purpose of an aggrieved party that given the chance would act the same, except they don't have the chance, so they make noise, much as you are right now. We can speak frankly and intelligently about these things, or we can continue to act like naive children and be treated as such by necessity in turn.

4841,"Beautiful picture. For people looking at this as a sign of multiculturalism that worked properly:

1) Bukovina is a name given by the Habsburgs, later Austrohungarians after they bought the region from the Ottomans - it was just North Moldova until then; Moldova had no say in it.

2) There were few Poles and probably no Germans until then ; Jews were most probably present but not at the same degree as after the annexation. Germans and Hungarians came for administrative purposes and left after the unification in 1918 - my great-greatgrandfather received a house where Germans used to live.

3) The only real mixing happened between Ukrainians, Moldavians and some Poles - even so, people knew which village was Ukrainian, Polish, Romanian. Ukrainian ancestry also built itself over centuries, as Romanians and Ukrainians lived together for 700 years at the least. I can't say much about the Hungarians but they probably mixed, to a limit, though I remember them leaving after 1918 as well.

In reality, mixing was still mostly only between Orthodox Christians - people still lived in separate communities and the Germans, Hungarians and (probably) Jews viewed themselves as the people that brought civilization to these parts. Nationalism and separatism was rampant, especially in Romanians and Ukrainians, which viewed Bukovina as their ancestral land and wanted to lead themselves. 

The current split of Bukovina, with the southern half in Romania and the northern part in the Ukraine was the best solution, despite it being enforced by the Soviets. Even so, a chunk of the northern part had and still has a considerable Romanian population, but as I said above, Ukrainians and Moldavians/Romanians were not belligerent against each other to truly separate (as opposed to Poles and Ukrainians, see Lviv/Pokutia).",Moldova,/r/europe/comments/idspt1/ethnic_groups_of_bukovina_region_austriahungary/g2bajkc/,MirrdynWyllt,1598006910

&gt;Both the UK and France did horribly at the start of the war. Considering all the time they had to study Wermacht tactics and prepare for war, it was shamefull.

Hmm yes if only the allies had HOI4 to practice their tactics, it would have been ok! Or maybe shits a lot more complicated than that. 

&gt;The only reason why the UK did not get wrecked the same as France was the Channel, pretty good navy and the absolute miracle of RAF being able to hold (with a lot of help from foreign aces, that barely saw action at the start because of how fucking idiotic royal officers were) and also the decision by Hitler to stop bombing the military targets and start bombing the cities. Churchill was very close to surrendering the whole country.

This just isn’t true. The fact the channel is there is the reason the Royal Navy was completely and utterly dominant over the German surface fleet. Britain relied on the sea. The RAF was never ‘just about to break’, that’s a myth from British massive overestimates of the size of the German airforce. The RAF actually increased its number of fighter aircraft during the Battle of Britain, and there was a greater stress on pilots than planes. Non British pilots made up around 20% of RAF pilots, but the majority of those were from other commonwealth countries. Polish and Czech pilots made up 5% and 3% of pilots respectively, significant and we are very thankful, but they weren’t some sort of miracle pilots.

4881,"&gt;The UK only has to rescue people in territorial waters.

Wrong. UK ship in international waters (just as well as in territorial waters) has to rescue people in distress. Read UNCLOS Article 98 (which in section handling 'High Seas' i.e. international waters) and SOLAS (regulation V/33). So do try again. This time with actual evidence instead your personal opinions.

&gt;If they are stopped from reaching the UK waters or land, they can't claim asylum.

Wrong. Any UK government ship (or ship performing government duty, so that you can't outsource it evade responsibility) is considered UK territory and hence any person there can request asylum.

&gt;UN law (the convention on the laws of the sea) allows the country to punish/refuse asylum to people who seek to break the law to try and circumvent proper procedure e.g. sailing from a safe country to try and sneak into the country illegally and then claim asylum so it 100% can be done. 

Wrong in most counts. It may allow for punishing the ship (i.e. crew, owner etc.), provided that they are not asylum seekers themselves. However the UN Refugee Convention explicitly forbids imposing punishments on asylum seekers who present their plea for asylum to the authorities without delay. They can sneak into the UK as long as they then present themselves to the authorities and request asylum.

&gt;France is not a place where life or freedom was threatened.

Mind you that word 'directly' in that clause does not mean that they could not stop. It means that they lose their status if the establish themselves somewhere (i.e. gain residence or asylum from some country) on the way. In other words having been to Calais jungle does not count. So it does not matter if their life or freedom were not threatened in France as long as it was threatened in the location from where they started.

&gt;Furthermore, by refusing to allow Dublin III to continue, what incentive does the UK have to participate in resettlement programs that currently operate in the EU effectively sharing out the people?

None, but then the UK could no longer return any of those who cross back into the EU either. It could only return them (in case of rejected asylum application) to their country of origin (provided it would not clash with the non-refoulement clause) or to some third country which agrees to receive them and is safe for them.

&gt;UK waters extend 12 miles from the coast, same as France. The channel agreement between the UK and France is that rescue boats take people to the nearest safe port, British rescue vessels spot a dinghy in French waters, rescue and take back to France. See the Sangette Protocol (1991) and Treaty of Le Touquet (2003)

Kinda wrong. A person onboard British rescue vessel (British governmental vessel, i.e. British territory) could already request asylum from the UK, even if that boat was on French waters. As said, you can't get rid of these responsibilities just by trying to outsource them. You are not the first one to try it. As to the agreements, it is rather unlikely that those would remain in place in their current form should no-deal Brexit occur.

&gt;Ultimately it is within the EU's best interests to continue Dublin III unless the UK wants to keep it but refuses to accept migrants under the resettlement programs

That doesn't exist at the moment. Not to the scale it needs to. So that part is only true if there is actual sharing of responsibilities (like say GDP based or GNI based) - which does not currently exist and which is why Dublin III is likely to see fair bit of changes to it. So the answer to your argument is that in its current form there is little reason for the EU to agree to it.",Finland,/r/europe/comments/id8uqj/eu_rejects_british_plan_for_postbrexit_return_of/g2bauxj/,Ohdake,1598007221

Few don't want want to learn romanian, just a handful. As you see, the hungarian minority in the rest of the country speak romanian very well (sometimes even better than some romanians). I suppose you are talking about the Szekler Land, where almost all the inhabitants are hungarian/sekler. Let me give you an example: if you are born in a village of romanians that speak only romanian, and you go only to romanian school, even if the village is in Italy, you would learn Italian? How, if you don't have parents and teachers to learn from? Is not about wanting to learn, but having the opportunity. Be assured, after the kids graduate from high school and live for university in a big city, they learn romanian in one or two years. But in their region, they don't feel the need to learn it, and there is none to teach them. Let's speak about the authorities, how they don't care if kids in Sekler Land don't learn romanian in school, which must be taught like a foreign language in the first years, not like their native language as romanian kids do. Because the authorities lack of care, the hungarians tend to listen to Viktor Orban's discourse. This can lead to dangerous situations, because we know who will be the  beneficiary if things in this region would go wrong (a big, eastern, old enemy of Europe, if you don't know who I am talking about).

4988,"The UK’s biggest bank HSBC has sharply downgraded its forecast for the UK economy, predicting it to shrink by 10.3 per cent this year and only grow six per cent in 2021.

The latest figures are markedly more pessimistic than its previous prediction of a 7.8 per cent contraction in 2020 followed by growth of 6.2 per cent next year.

Read more: UK inflation unexpectedly rises on oil prices and clothes shopping

It is also much more gloomy than the Bank of England, which said the UK economy would return to its pre-coronavirus size by the end of 2021. The BoE said the economy would shrink 9.5 per cent this year and grow nine per cent in 2021.

By contrast, HSBC today said in a report that the UK economy would likely be 4.5 per cent smaller by the end of 2021 than it was at the end of 2019.

The giant UK lender contrasted its new forecasts with some relatively rosy commentary that has recently come from the Bank of England.

The BoE’s chief economist Andy Haldane has been particularly bullish. He wrote in the Daily Mail last week: “Now is the time to see the economic glass as half-full not half-empty.”

He has previously pointed to payments data that showed a relatively rapid rebound in spending as the coronavirus lockdown was eased.

Recent UK economy data ‘worse than expected’
But HSBC senior economist Elizabeth Martins said recent economic data was underwhelming. The UK economy crashed by an historic 20.4 per cent in the second quarter, which “was worse than we had expected,” Martins said.

She said that unlike Haldane, “recent data outturns have made us more pessimistic about the lasting economic impact”.

Martins added: “The UK is far from back to normal.” Official figures from the end of July showed only 5.5 per cent of those who had been furloughed had returned to work, she said. And “a significant number of businesses have simply not reopened”.

However, Martins said there had “clearly been green shoots” since April. The easing of lockdown has increased activity and fiscal incentives like the “eat out to help out” scheme have boosted the economy.

HSBC maintained its previous prediction that unemployment would hit 7.2 per cent by the end of the year, which would likely see around 3m out of work.

Worth noting that a cop had a gun in his face about 5 seconds into their interaction while he's stammering an apology. There's a  lot of gun violence in America, so I know why police are on edge, but it makes Floyd's nervous breakdown understandable.

He had drugs in his system, but it didn't look like he was dying until he had a knee on his neck.

5108,"That Alexander Lukashenko is president of Belarus in name only should gladden democrats everywhere. So often before have we stood and watched aghast as democracy is not only ignored but cruelly subverted by despots, who use it to add a veneer of respectability to their iron rule. Belarus is perhaps the most egregious example of this in the West, having been allowed to exist in a state of political winter since the fall of the Iron Curtain, as other Baltic, central and eastern European states thawed gradually from the communist permafrost. Belarus is still a long way from realising this dream – and appears to have fewer friends west of Brest than it might have hoped. 

Perhaps as a result of the other issues engulfing Europe at the moment, London, Paris, Berlin and Brussels don’t seem too concerned with what is unfolding on the streets of Minsk and elsewhere. Economies are tanking, unrest is brewing, migrants are on the move, and Turkey and Greece are rattling sabers once again. But it would be to give these centres of Western power too much of a bye to suggest that the coronavirus outbreak and its financial reverberations were the chief reasons for a revolt on their doorstep not being a major concern. 

Thierry Breton, the European Commissioner for the Internal Market , today set out in plain terms how the bloc views the country, stating: “Belarus is not Europe, it is on the border of Europe, between Europe and Russia, and the situation is not comparable to Ukraine or Georgia. Belarus is really strongly connected with Russia and the majority of the population is favourable to close links with Russia.” 

No doubt this was music to the ears of those risking their lives by warring in the streets, who have had enough of living in a repressive police state under one-party rule, to hear that, actually, in a world obsessed with race and identity, their history and ethnicity is effectively irrelevant, and that what they really want is Vladimir Putin. 
It is true that culturally the two peoples share much. But geography should not mean that Belarus is locked in tyranny perpetually. Under Lukashenko, Minsk leant heavily on Moscow since 1994 to maintain its unsustainable command economy, and became beholden to Russian subsidies. The country has suffered badly as that support has gradually disappeared. Is this really the fault of the people now so openly gunning for this toxic relationship to change?

It is not true to say that the county differs so greatly from Ukraine or Georgia as to discourage more Western interest – if not assistance. Both those countries – one of which is bordered by Armenia, Azerbaijan and Turkey, in addition to the bear to the north – were effectively split in two by Moscow, the end result being Russian troops in the Donbas, Crimea, Abkhazia and South Ossetia. 

One wonders if it is partly because of those events that Europe is less interested in getting involved now. Having seen Moscow’s willingness to use force, it has decided that, on the whole, helping these far off eastern places (on the Polish border) is not worth the hassle.

Of course, this is Russia’s sphere of influence. We cannot be surprised that a vast frontier state might react aggressively to others trying to loosen its grip on its neighbours. But just because it shares a border with a country prepared to use considerable force does not make Belarusian desires for democracy less valid.

The rest of Europe will say that, because force is yet to be used, there is no need for alarm. It is also, it must be said, unlikely to happen at this stage. But as thousands risk torture and death even now at the hands of the authorities – and nothing is done to stop it – it must already be clear that were Russian tanks to roll over the border, no one would lift a finger to stop them. Europe – that bastion of freedom – would happily let one tyranny be replaced by another in a European state. 

Russia’s foreign ministry has warned that attempts to interfere in Belarus by actors other than itself are “doomed to failure”. But it needn’t bother issuing such warnings if Europe and the rest have already signaled that they don’t have the stomach for intervention beyond a smattering of sanctions. 

The nasty truth, though, is not just that western Europe is intimidated by the sight of Russian forces. The reality is that western Europe doesn’t view its central and eastern partners as equals – not even the ones it has let into its club. And as Monsieur Breton has revealed, those not in the club are barely European at all. Instead, they are people in need of firm governance by strongmen, beyond the help of the enlightened, whose state of existence, though not of their own making, cannot be overcome. This is a view that has been held by others in the past – to disastrous effect. 

If Belarus is to really emerge from its long winter, it needs that attitude abroad to change. Until then, it will remain firmly in the grip of thugs, acting not as a functioning state but as a buffer between East and West, and providing an ominous reminder to the European states in the Baltic just how isolated they are.",,/r/europe/comments/idqb9i/fearful_of_russian_aggression_europe_is/g2ao0hv/,casualphilosopher1,1597985287

5123,"The BLM protests were actually just protests most of the time. For example, I live in the city where George Floyd was born, and his funeral was held here. There was a large BLM protest, but it wasn't anything like a riot. [This article](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Large-Houston-crowd-memorializes-George-Floyd-15312644.php) explains the details. It's just one example, but there were peaceful and mostly-peaceful protests like that in many parts of the country, though some of the protests did turn into riots.

Anyway, BLM protests aren't a prominent issue right now. Coronavirus is the big issue, especially now that schools are reopening (August is the traditional start of the American school year, though most districts have delayed reopening). Trump might want to use a racial law-and-order narrative like the one you described, but the pandemic plus time quashed the big protests, and such a narrative would seem forced at this point.

Trump's approval ratings are going up, but they plummeted a few months ago (due to his response to the pandemic), so thus far, they're just returning to their baseline. [Source](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/). 

Trump's problem is that most Americans made up their minds about him long ago. [Here](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_biden-6247.html) you can see a right-leaning poll aggregator's chart of 2020's general election polling. Compare it to their data from [2016](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html). Hillary's support went up and down, sometimes dropping below Trump's. In contrast, Biden has consistently been ahead of Trump, indicating that fewer Americans are struggling to make up their minds.

Nobody wants to count Trump out after what happened in 2016. However, it was much easier for Trump to vilify Hillary than Biden. Hillary was under FBI investigation in 2016, for example. And since we're in the midst of a crisis, it's likely that the focus will remain on Trump's response to the coronavirus, which isn't a fruitful environment for a Republican surge.

Finally, check out the [Cook Political Report's Electoral College analysis](https://cookpolitical.com/sites/default/files/2020-07/EC%20Ratings.072320.2.pdf). It's a .pdf file, just so you know. Quoting it: ""Republicans have 187 electoral votes in the Solid, Likely and Lean categories and would need 43 (100%) electoral votes from the Toss Up column plus 40 votes from the Lean Democrat column."" Meanwhile, the Democrats are at 308 projected EC votes. It takes 270 to win the election.

The balance could shift, but recall how steady Biden's lead over Trump has been this year.",Where at least I know I'm free,/r/europe/comments/idi601/france_the_united_kingdom_and_germany_issue_a/g2aoqn6/,executivemonkey,1597985807

We're probably more divided now than we have been for a long time but not as divided as the US.

Brexit and the EU really divided us and still does. We may actually become physically divided in the future too as there's a growing movement for Scottish independence. 

Overall though, we agree on more than we disagree on. Both our main parties are centre left and there's not a massive difference between them. Having universal healthcare, a welfare state and strict gun controls are supported by pretty much everyone. 

We have very few far left or far right people. We do have racists though and people who oppose any immigration, unless it's a white Aussie or Kiwi etc. I think most people started out horrified by George Floyd's death and supporting BLM but the movement became a bit political here too. I basically think the racists felt threatned. Even so, we don't have the racial division the US has. 

We don't really have climate change deniers either. We care a lot about our environment and wildlife. We want renewable energy and are doing really well at moving away from coal. We're trying to reduce the use of plastic. None of that is political here, we all agree.

5231,"I would like to remind you that the Iranians were getting inspections from the UN which they followed, by an agency I'm inclined to trust. This current status where there's no enforcement mechanism is the fault of the US which scrapped the deal and was not able to articulate any good replacement, and since then the Iranians had the diplomatic right to say that the other side broke the deal.

If the US wanted another deal, it went about it wrong.

The overuse of the ""WMD"" argument, as well as the current Administration's clear bellicosity and hostility to all other signatories, and it's own actions of nuclear aid for Saudi Arabia have also sapped any moral authority and credibility. Tell me, what are the long term plans here? I have seen none articulated from American policymakers, which makes others wary of another Middle Eastern SNAFU due to prior experience.

Your black and white view is far from pragmatic. Iran did not escalate after their general's death, and Israel has nukes as well. We're likely even closer to midnight for the apocalypse, which is not ideal, but we live in a world with NK and the tensions between Iran vs Pakistan.

Our world is indeed not a nice place. So, what justifications can the US find to continue? Religious zealotry is not enough in view of the Saudis, and few have the appetite to bolster the US's hegemony.

EDIT: That is not to say that officials other than the American have stopped trying. The EU and others hopes that the Iranians can be convinced to enter back into a deal, while the US hopes that it can intimidate them to back down (which seems to be doing the opposite).",All expressed views are not representative,/r/europe/comments/idi601/france_the_united_kingdom_and_germany_issue_a/g2aeyl3/,frissio,1597979490

5236,"Usually Germany (Europe?) is a few years back in big US trends. - I think the loss of trust in main stream media is a pretty universal trend anyway ( - and when you think about how concentrated private media ownership is, and how close to think tanks / lobby groups, and how dependent on advertising money / consumerism, I get why people become suspicious). In Germany we still have public broadcasters that depend less on advertising, and in theory could hold their distance, keep true to their mission statements, but how they are setup makes them intertwined with traditional political parties to quite an extent ever since: journalists are often too close to politicians imho, and a lot of the political formats / talkshows on traditional TV are critical in a very trained reflex / almost superficial way. - What we don’t have, is that strong role of talk radio that the US has, and the politicization via social media / podcasts I’d count rather on the positive side of things: despite filter bubble and all: the internet is still your friend in getting diverse information and longer formats, and everyone acquires a bit of his / her own media-competence while at it.

As for Germany’s political landscape: while the parties at the center lose popularity, and the parties at the edges of the spectrum are gaining (- we don’t have a two party system), I think there is still a bit of “immunization” left from recent history: people are still aware, of how going too far right or left has lead into catastrophe. The demographic (- voter age is high) favors a more conservative approach in the future, but youth will probably radicalize, as not enough is done to tackle the environmental challenges, while their voter block is too small to change things on its own. What once was the Green party has become pretty conservative in its voter structure (because of age), and I’d expect a conservative-green coalition with higher probability than a red-red-green one... - the Greens will probably end up in government next term anyway, while the right-wing AfD will probably still be shunned by other parties for at least one more cycle (- which might make them stronger in the long term though).",,/r/europe/comments/idnztc/europe_compared_to_the_united_states_question/g2afjmg/,Stadtpark90,1597979828

5238,"This... is true.

It is the reason why treaties require 2/3 Senate approval: the U.S. doesn't want a later reversal. Obama gambled that his former secretary of state would follow him and his unapproved deal would be fine. It was a horrible gamble for the American people.

The nuclear deal was unpopular in America, Obama does own that. He focused on his globalist vision and ignored many constituents, his actual employers, within the USA. The deal was unpopular because the Iranian Embassy attack, which was entirely unwarranted, looms large in the American psyche. It is viewed as a moment of weakness that exploited the Carter administration's relatively friendly foreign policy. The Reagan administration changed and used a heavier hand in response, and that was a hallmark of US Iranian relations for 35 years. That doesn't just end because Obama popped out and said he will give up leverage in exchange for not finishing a nuclear weapon that will always be a few months away under the best terms.

Much of the European pride in the deal seems to lie in it being a Euro-led initiative, which had not been done in a generation or more. Secondly, Iran seems interested in trading with Europe, especially oil. The US doesn't feel those same effects. When coupled with the embassy attack (and the marine barracks explosion in Beirut to a lesser extent) there is much more baggage to unwind on the American side than the European side.

The US people lost interest when the US wasn't getting the same trade rewards as Europe while giving up so much leverage in related Iranian disputes (e.g. Syria, Yemen, rocket tests).

I wish this deal wasn't reversed, but most of all I wish Obama had brought some substantive improvement and some sort of reconciliation for the embassy attack through the deal that was visible to the American peiople.

Lockdowns are not touted, by themselves, as a solution to the pandemic. 

Their purpose is to flatten the curve of contamination, it's a last resort measure that prevents health infrastructures from collapsing under an exponential flow of patients that exceeds the capacity of treatment.

The alternative is having too many people to care for simultaneously, with the direct consequence that many of them simply cannot be treated and are left to die at home or in a hospital hallway.

We have a movie about him that sold extremely well and a lot of people fawn over him here (I happen to look like him and get compared to him a lot). 

So now that Trump is struggling with being re-elected, he wants to do something that will heavily boost his ratings, and pardoning Snowden is something that’s unanimously popular. But of course if Snowden ever moves back to America, the CIA would almost certainly disappear him. He said he will remain in Russia even if he’s pardoned.

There are legal rituals before a murder is sanctioned, be that the death penalty where it is still practiced, the formal declaration of war, or the secret government council where drone strikes are approved. 

In Russia, the security services and criminal elements are simply used to killing people when it suits them, when they see the chance they do it. Sometimes these efforts are presumably sanctioned from the very top, but at other times they serve business interests or personal grievances of those who have acquired power in the Russians hierarchy. This ambiguity is even used by the Russian state to introduce deniability for state actions.

The Yugoslavian system was somewhat like the USSR used to be, but the current Russian system is not. In nations like Mexico or in the past Southern Italy, organized crime is a very strong presence in society as it does in Russia, but in those places there was always some more legitimate government trying that could not be ignored.

Plus while Trump is a bombastic ass Biden is honestly just as bad but in a way that brings less of a spotlight to himself. Stuff like [calling black people who vote for Trump ""not black""](https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/22/politics/biden-charlamagne-tha-god-you-aint-black/index.html), calling the [Hispanic community diverse, ""unlike the black community""](https://www.npr.org/2020/08/07/900147716/biden-backtracks-comments-contrasting-diversity-in-black-and-latino-communities), and has a [pretty lackluster track record in congress](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-51803885), including on minorities which [not too long ago Kamala herself attacked](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-biden/bidens-record-on-race-expected-to-be-in-crosshairs-at-second-2020-debate-idUSKCN1UP20E).

I will say Biden would probably be better at working with other countries. However, he is also proposing a lot of spending and tax increases, and between foreign image and paying more to the government a lot of people will choose the later. And that's before the way his mental ability really does seem to be diminishing, which leaves the question in a lot of people's mind if he would make it 4 years.

To sum it up though I will say I can't believe these are the 2 ""best"" people we could find to run for president and I really don't want to vote for either, and I think it's going to be a close election, but I also don't think it's a slam dunk for Biden like Reddit often thinks.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/idi601/france_the_united_kingdom_and_germany_issue_a/g2a1wl8/,Ricky_Boby,1597972285

5379,"&gt;On the counter point, while nuclear weapons are in general stupid, wasteful, and incredibly dangerous things to build and stockpile

On the contrary, nuclear weapons are the most efficient kind of a weapon, deterrent in themselves but also a way to reduce your reliance on conventional forces significantly. Doesn't make the implied usage of them any less immoral of course. 

&gt;I don't really see the problem with in particular Iran having them. Their longterm prospects seem at least as stable as Pakistan's. It might lead to general Middle Eastern proliferation, but still, politically these weapons work defensively. Move the doomsday clock a couple minutes closer to midnight, accept that an accidental nuclear explosion is a little more likely, and accept that you shouldn't be invading Middle Eastern countries anymore. Now would that be so bad?

Without nukes, Iran is practically harmless on the strategic level - its only long reach are ballistic missiles, which are behind North Korea in tech, and suffer from a relatively short range and low reliability. That's in addition to their clandestine forces, which are still largely confined to Shia \ Shia-friendly regions. But then if Iran gets nukes everything changes. Suddenly their relatively harmless ballistic missiles get the power to erase multimillion population centers. Also who knows if rakhbar goes crazy and shares nuke with Hezbollah to attack Israel, to retaliate after their forces get bombed in Syria. Iran is also far from stable - it is a mix of ethnic groups (though with dominant Iranian population in major urban centers) governed by a repressive theocratic regime that has some significant regional enemies.",The other Galicia,/r/europe/comments/idi601/france_the_united_kingdom_and_germany_issue_a/g2a2sun/,Strydwolf,1597972774

Basically:

- the US want the sanctions provisioned in the [JCPoA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Comprehensive_Plan_of_Action) to be reinstated against Iran
- but the US have withdrawn from the JCPoA in 2018
- thus, the US cannot invoke measures provisioned in an agreement they're not part of (anymore)

That's of course ridiculously obvious and logical, but it had to be stated because the US formally requested it, and tried to exploit a possible legal loophole.

&amp;nbsp;

The rest of the statement addresses the facts

- that France, Germany and the United Kingdom (E3) believes that the Iranian problem should be solved through dialogue, negotiation and a constructive multilateral approach, rather than blunt sanctions and division amongst the involved actors (JCPoA parties and UN members)
- and that the scheduled expiry of the current arms embargo against Iran is a source of concern, as this country is still acknowledged by the E3 to be a destabilising factor in the region",France,/r/europe/comments/idi601/france_the_united_kingdom_and_germany_issue_a/g29lkqr/,Orravan_O,1597963388

Religious societies have been shown to be happier and less suicidal ( [https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/01/31/are-religious-people-happier-healthier-our-new-global-study-explores-this-question/](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/01/31/are-religious-people-happier-healthier-our-new-global-study-explores-this-question/) )  For example, suicide rates are significantly lower in Turkey than in Japan or Lithuania, despite Turkey being less a developed and poorer country with a lower living standard. To pretend that religiosity plays no role here is borderline delusional.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Because, thankfully, shitty families and unhappy marriages are now ""discontinued"" more often than in the past, when it was frowned upon or not allowed, because of religion.

It's unfortunate that you view this positively because nobody benefits from this other than divorce lawyers, who profit off of conflict and hate.

5473,"&gt;I beat this drum a lot, but for a Europa to emerge, it will take some amount of relegating 'German' and 'Romanian' and 'Greek' and 'French' identity to something politically/socially/culturally/linguistically subordinate - just as a Virginian or Pennsylvania identity - all between Anglo-Saxon Christians what's more! - had to be subordinated, eventually, for 'America' to emerge.

Not to tout my horn, but one's national identity isn't just some meaningless label that can be substituted or subside. I'm French for example and part of what that means for me is the strict separation of church and state which I consider integral to social progress. I would find unacceptable to live in a country like germany or italy where there are political parties with religious names and values on them like the christian democrats for example. I would find even less acceptable for France to have to rescind on its laicity and any amount of empathy will tell me that there exists someone on the other side of the borders who will have an opinion opposite to mine.

&gt;If the gains of special status were negligible and a custom union was not profitable for Turkey, I wonder why Turkey is literally blackmailing EU to get one.

Well that's because I never said such a thing. Re-read what I said; a partial CU is useless. Not a full one. You can see [here](https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/business/calculation-customs-duties/rules-origin/customs-unions/turkey-customs-unions-preferential-arrangements_en) how EU benefits more than Turkey. 

As I said before selling coal and steel to EU only to buy it back as industrial goods benefits GER/FR more than us. And it also has the effect of completely suffocating local industry because they are not advanced/profitable enough to compete with EU goods. So a partial CU can go fuck itself and it wouldn't be a big fucking deal, you know what I mean?

I back up what I say with sources and info and I may be insulting a bit when I express my opinion but it certainly is not horseshit because I know what the fuck I am talking about. So pretty please provide me some good info that I don't know about this magic investment that EU is making in Turkey.

What happens if a Bugatti Chiron and a Porsche 911 decide to overtake a line of queuing cars at the same time? Nothing good, especially for the owners of the two luxury cars.

The accident is actually the result of a rather trivial situation: a simple queue of cars behind a motorhome. Unfortunately the Bugatti Chiron driver decided to overtake the queue of vehicles in the same exact moment as the driver of the Porsche 911 did.

The accident at this point was inevitable. A motorhome and a Mercedes were also involved in the collision.

According to the Uri Cantonal Police, the driver of the camper van was taken to hospital. Also according to the Police, the drivers of the two luxury cars did not fill in and sign the friendly statement form.

Just to give you an idea, only about 85% of all official positions within the magistrature (so prosecutors and judges) are filled in, and then you have to take into account that that number of official positions often still falls short of the realistic needs.

As a result, investigations and court cases dragging on a long time isn't unheard of. A few years for a homicide investigation unfortunately is a realistic term. As a personal anecdote as a Belgian: I've been the victim of a bike theft. The police identified and caught the thief a few months later, but is still took more than a year after the police caught the guy for the case to go to trial. The thief got sentenced to prison and I got awarded a few thousand euros in damages, but it still took  a while to get that judgment. And mind that this was for a simple bike theft.

My ethnic brothers are being led by Europe's racist understandings of culture. The more divided Turkey is, easier for those sub-states to be puppets. I'd rather die a proud Turk than a European puppet. Leave our land to us and deal with your own.

Ethinicity means nothing, although I guess it is hard for you closet racists to comprehend that. And we Kurds (Who live in Turkey of course, the ones drunk in ""self determination"" tend to be the ones in Western countries) in modern Turkey face no discrimination unless we openly state that we support terrorists and we want to divide the country. I also hate people like them, because they are utilizing my ethnicity and putting me in danger of living in a weak Western Proxy. Their ignorance is putting me in danger and I will support Turkey as much as any other Turk would. Because even if I am ethnically Kurdish, I am a proud Turk.

Its mentioned halfway in the article 

""Wat wel al is beslist, is dat de agente die een Hitlergroet bracht geen operationele diensten meer mag doen en geen contact meer met het publiek mag hebben. ""

Personally I feel conflicted by the incident. Because this  is not caused by internal issues in the policeforce. Its more a growing problem of how cops are treated in Belgium lately. Our leftist govt that ruled for the past 30 years completely ignored multiple calls for action on regards how the Police is treated and has to deal with certain communities. Not long ago we had a conflict on one of our beaches ( Blankenberge) where 50+ muslim young men started a fight. They called police and ambulance just to mock them when they arrived. Throwing things, calling names, acting aggressive, because of policies our Policeforce isnt equiped to handle these kinds of situations ( from a legal perspective) 
It wasnt an anomaly, this happens regulary and it is always the same community. 
In my opinion the growing racist rethoric in our Policefoce is a consequence of severe mismanagement and lack of utilities to combat the growing mentality of ""F**** the police"" 

It is almost a daily occurance that a cop gets stabbed, hindered with an arrest by bystanders, etc etc. If it always comes from the same community ( gang-related muslim men) its a ticking timebomb for some to become actual racists.",Flanders (Belgium),/r/europe/comments/icoa1g/a_slovak_man_jozef_chovanec_has_died_while_in_the/g28a82q/,MokoBruh,1597942299

5758,"&gt;their legitimacy is not determined by Putin.

There are conflicting and incompatible definitions of legitimacy that exist in Belarus right now, and one will eventually prevail. Until the conflict is resolved, there is no unambiguous definition of legitimacy as far as Belarusian institutions are concerned. Putin is supporting one of the conflicting definitions, EU and the protesters - another. Legitimacy is always arbitrary and ultimately boils down to physical enforcement.

&gt;No government is, if you put it that way. I broke the speed limit twice today.

Indeed. But nobody's international arrangements are going to be particularly thrown off by this challenge to state authority, so they can just pretend that your sovereign government is in exclusive control for their own purposes. What's happening in Belarus is clearly a significant enough challenge for external governments to reconsider who they should be maintaining diplomatic relations with.

Stop going on tangents. Putin is elbow deep up Belarusian politics, and any accusations of ""meddling"" are just him trying to discredit other interested parties that are also getting involved.

5763,"I'm sure that what will happen in our Belarus is exactly that - an ""Armenian scenario"" where democratization might actually be useful for Russia. 

Putin understands that even if a radical pro-EU-NATO-US, anti-Russia leader comes to power, he can't just shake off all dependency overnight. Our economy basically depends entirely on Russia, on that sweet, sweet oil processing revenue. A Russian embargo would be more harmful than a Russian invasion.

&gt;But if Putin and his allies decide that such democratization could ""infect"" Russia directly, situation changes.

Hot take - I don't think that he will mind democratization, **as long as** the policy in some key sectors (the foreign policy, military, for example) isn't threatened.

Think back to Francisco Franco. He was a fascist dictator who came to power in Spain because of a bloody civil war. Fascist is as fascist does. But, the last couple of years of his rule were spent educating the population towards democracy, paving the way to the Spain that we see now.

Or Augusto Pinochet. Came to power because of a U.S.-backed coup, but made an economic miracle, and retired on his own accord. Chile is in a good place right now.

5775,"&gt;Now, suddenly, Europe is stirring. The COVID-19 pandemic appears to have awakened the continent from its decades-long economic and political slumber and reinvigorated the EU integration project in ways that were unimaginable just six months ago. Jean Monnet, one of the founding architects of the European Union, famously said that “Europe will be forged in crises.” 


The Migrant crisis didn't do it, and the Coronavirus crisis won't do it either, and neither will Turkish or Russian (hey are they European or not? What about Ukranians? Belarussians? Moldovans? Romanians _are_, right?) overtures.

The EU is ultimately a good organization for the nations of people who have organized themselves in Empires, nation-States, and the like, called 'Europeans', but crises imho are illustrating that it has the same problem which the US is now developing demographically/socioeconomically and politically - that the whole thing is made up of peoples with their own identities, between whom wins and losses, and direction, are irreconcilable.  

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acad%C3%A9mie_Fran%C3%A7aise

National identity is as much as choice as it is an evolution. 

I beat this drum a lot, but for a Europa to emerge, it will take some amount of relegating 'German' and 'Romanian' and 'Greek' and 'French' identity to something politically/socially/culturally/linguistically subordinate - just as a Virginian or Pennsylvania identity - all between Anglo-Saxon Christians what's more! - had to be subordinated, eventually, for 'America' to emerge.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/idc25j/europes_geopolitical_awakening_the_pandemic/g28aum4/,lost_snake,1597942591

Mate I would have agreed with you on that regard if Turkey hadnt sent Oruc Reis with warships in the disputed area. Before that both countries had their own claims that suited their interests and they just left it at that. Then Turkey decided to act on its own claim using force, doing it first with Cyprus and then with Greece. That's why you're viewed like that. The aggression towards your country stems from the reasons I explained earlier. 

I understand that Turkey wants to pursue it's interests but that doesn't justify everything. All counties want to do that and many times their actions bring a backlash. The whole thing about the law only says that while Turkey technically isn't violating the law, it's acting against the way that most other countries act and it ends up causing trouble.

5925,"&gt;Macron, in a statement published this Thursday by Paris Match magazine, explains that he has reached this conclusion after being open with the Turkish president, since he has been ""one of the rare European leaders"" who has received him in recent years, in January 2018, a fact that ""many (were) reproached"".
Not only did he invite him then to Paris, but he went to see him in September of that year in Istanbul and also launched the initiative for a summit of the Europeans with Turkey in London in December 2019.
But from all this, the lesson he has drawn is that ""his power politics is an expansionist policy that mixes nationalism and Islamism, which is not compatible with European interests. It is a destabilising factor. Europe must look at the facts head on and assume it"". He points out that he is not in favour of an escalation, but neither does he believe in ""impotent diplomacy"".
Therefore, in a reference to his decision last week to send military reinforcements to the eastern Mediterranean in support of Greece in the face of tensions with Turkey over hydrocarbon prospecting, Macron states that ""we have sent the signal that European solidarity made sense"".",,/r/europe/comments/id8pic/macron_says_erdogans_policy_is_incompatible_with/g27hgfm/,Stefanos1010,1597927627

5964,"&gt; The £10bn fiscal transfer wouldn't stop until independence (or some agreement) was come to.

I think it would. No UK government would want to continue spending more per capita in Scotland following a successful independence referendum. It would be incredibly unpopular with the voters in the rest of the UK (imagine the Daily Mail headlines), there is no requirement they do so, and the money could be used elsewhere on voters who would still be electing politicians to the UK parliament at the next election.

Beside which it would make life much more difficult for the Scottish government and that's just human nature for the ""losing"" side.

&gt;Same as Scottish people wouldn't stop paying taxes to HMRC the moment independence vote was won.

There'd have to be a phased transition because transferring powers to a Scottish tax agency would take years. 

But note this is different from the fiscal transfer. The fiscal transfer is extra money for Scotland, over and above what it contributes. It's hard to justify now, because much poorer areas like Wales and northern England get less that Scotland despite being more in need. Scotland now has enough to provide higher levels of service than most of the rest of the country and lower taxes as well.

After an independence vote, with the political case for the fiscal transfer gone, and no moral case, I can't see the UK government continuing it. I expect the Barnett formula would be scrapped, spending on Scotland would be reduced to a similar level to Scottish revenue and Wales and northern England would see increases in spending.

&gt;How the fuck they think they're going to fill that £10bn hole.. Who knows.

I am assured by nationalists things would be ""different"" after independence. When you ask which taxes would increase and which services would be cut they fall back on ""every country has a deficit"" or just repeat it would be ""different"".",,/r/europe/comments/icmivv/latest_panelbase_poll_puts_support_for_scottish/g27hwl1/,WhiteSatanicMills,1597927923
