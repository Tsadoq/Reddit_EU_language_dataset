22,"I know better than you how taxes work. Here is an example of Polish pension system:

4 governments ago, government realized that pension system will sooner or later fail. They created law which gave people choice to pick in which bank you will keep your money which then would be invested and hopefully it would grow more than how fast government prints money without backing (inflation). That money would be our private money after period end and we would be able to take it away or get paid monthly. If you chose one of payment it would be worse option than getting paid monthly (remember interests on money which still is in bank). There was still some part that went into ZUS (national insurance which is pension system)

Yearly people go information about their account and projected pay if they would try to cash in that day. So if i would cash out today after 15 years of that system i would get around 1400zl netto which is around 333€ which is about around polish minimum wage. After just 15 years of not even average pay i would get about minimum polish wage. It is great deal. With further 15 years so total of 30 years of continuous pay i could have decent pension. Absolutely free of any perturbation caused by demographics. 

2 government ago. Supposed centre-right government PO which is now opposition that screams about rule of law in poland being broken which is actually left wing. Took 50% of my money from that private bank and paid essentially debt of government and promised me instead that that money will go toward ZUS from which i will get half of my pension. Amount ? Nope i don't know it because there is no money in ZUS, there is no account which i can check anything anything that ZUS takes is spend on government. I have 0 prediction of how my pension will look like and from prediction of analysts after i will retire in next 25 years i shouldn't even expect minimum wage. In fact if i will get anything out of it, it will be a good thing.

Ok, then current government comes. Supposedly ultra right wing PIS. They take away rest of the money and create social programs to pay for children, invalids, 13th pension for pensioners. Aka they are same red blooded left wing socialists that stole my money to pay someone else with it for their political support.

And now i don't know how much i will get from my penions. If i get anything at all is under question because money i pay for pension literally has no connection to what i get.


And how rich are getting by ? They create company and as business owners they pay minimal pay they can which is far below my 30%. So in the end they win and i lose.

Without that retarded system i could instead take those 30% of my pay and buy land. It would be 1000% more secure than any system those socialist came up with.

Now i can't even have 5 children family because i can't buy land or house for my pay that would warrant 5 family house.

But hey if i make 5 children now government will pay me 5x500zl aka 2500zl which is more than minimal pay. And as idiot i should be happy trailing along until we all will go bankrupt.",,/r/europe/comments/e86r3q/france_pensions_overhaul_to_go_ahead_despite_huge/fa9uuli/,perkeljustshatonyou,1575892820

If we're talking about qualifications, no. The most qualified is the best, obviously.

However, if politics is dominated entirely by, say, old men, then you can be pretty certain that's not simply the most qualified people, and gender discrimination exists, which is wrong.

Moreover, in politics, arguably diversity matters more than skill. Hear me out! Politicians are supposed to represent the population, so for example if everyone was from the cities, who would understand and take up the cause of the people of the countryside? Wouldn't a working class background lead to a better understanding of the plight of the working class? Surely a doctor can bring something valuable to a discussion about healthcare reform, and an economist has ever relevant expertise.

If everyone had the same background, education and experiences, the dominant assumptions in parliament would never be challenged by someone with different experiences, and parliament would be blind to many issues and perspectives in society.

198,"yeah, same with Germany. politically and organizationally it's the same thing, just a different name for the position; or rather, for some reason a specific English translation exists for the position. take ireland for example, the position of Taoiseach gets translated as ""prime minister"" even though the position is only comparable to that of a prime minister in Anglo countries (and nowadays, often doesn't get translated at all).  

soy to summarize:     

1. translation to the English term of prime minister is always only an approximation, actual responsibilities might differ depending on country  
2. heads of state that don't have a presidential system (like US, France, since recently Turkey) could *all* be translated as ""prime minister""

207,"&gt;This comment should be removed for literal nazi propoganda. This is so dimonstrably false all it takes is a simple wiki page to prove it. 
&gt;
&gt;\-The city was founded by Poles 300 years before the Teutonic State stole it. 
&gt;
&gt;\-The city petitioned the Polish King to annex the city back into the Kingdom
&gt;
&gt;\-In 1815 When Napoleon ""liberated"" Poland, Gdansk Peitioned Brandenburg to let the city once again be returned to Poland 
&gt;
&gt;\-The city architects for over a century were Dutch architects that planned and Built the city in Dutch Renaissanse Style. 
&gt;
&gt;\-Even Konigsberg in 1530 had over 1/4 of the city Polish speaking. Given that Gdansk was the center of the Polish Lutheran movement, it was a merchent city and most merchants would be bilingual, Alot of the population would have been Polish.
&gt;
&gt;\- The city also had massive ammounts of Dutch, Scottish, Polish and Jewish immigrants, so the Portion of the city that had actualy come from Germany was not as large as you think. 
&gt;
&gt;In other words, the city was nor founded by Germans, or even built by Germans for the most part, and defintley not inhabbited by just Germans. The people didnt even call themselves Germans but Prussians and considered themselves Polish citizens. Please educate youself before spreading more propoganda.
&gt;
&gt;Johannes Hevelius, mayor of Danzig:
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Hevelius considered himself as being citizen of the Polish world (*civis Orbis Poloniae*)[\[27\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Hevelius#cite_note-29) and stated in a letter dated from 9 January 1681 that he was *Civis orbis Poloni, qui in honorem patriae suae rei Literariae bono tot labores molestiasque, absit gloria, cum maximo facultatum suarum dispendio perduravit*\-""**citizen of Polish world who, for glory of his country and for the good of science, worked so much, and while not boasting much, executed his work with most effort per his abilities""**

Swinging the nazi club in the first sentence isn't quite really a foundation for a civilised discussion. 
Yes, Danzig's history is definitely more complex than my provocative one liner suggests. However, many of your points are pure cherry picking, too.

I agree on the fact that my wording made it look like I was trying to construct the narrative of an ethically purely german city from the beginning of its existence on, which is historically incorrect and counterproductive to the right point I was making.

The city's population *by the time of the forceful deportation* was  comprised of more than 90 percent (check the various pre war quotes, including the one I cited) by germans who didn't feel much allegiance to Poland. That makes it a *de facto German city, full stop.
Even in the first ethnical census we have at our disposal from 1841 germans accounted for 76% of the population whereas the polish population made up 24%.That numbers should be taken with a grain of salt because the surroundings were also included. 

At this point it is *completely irrelevant* who founded the city or that one german speaking mayor from in the 17th century swore allegiance to Poland. 

What's your point anyway? All the narrative you're building up can only lead to the conclusion that  Poland had a claim on Danzig in 1945. *Which is absolutely not the case, full stop*",near Germany,/r/europe/comments/e7rrcv/gdansk_poland/fa9kz3m/,ConanTehBavarian,1575878221

And what do you call all the Slavs in East Germany who assimulated, are they German ethicaly or nationaly? Because Gdansk was a Polish city with a multi Ethnic population, so saying Germans populated the city is just blantly wrong when talking about nationality because they were Polish citizens and called them selves Prussians or Polonus, and ethically they were VERY mixed so not even ethnicaly German.

A prime minister from Transylvania who changed the law so that the mayors can be elected directly from the first round, so the same mayors can keep governing in Transylvania. Not only that this law is extremely scummy and an obvious abuse of power to extend their own governing by undermining the electorate, but it had awful repercussions on Bucharest a few years ago, when Gabriela Firea was elected as a result out of this awful law, which wouldn't have happened without it. And she really is a shit mayor. 

Imagine this scenario in America: Trump and the rest of the democrats would all candidate for the presidency, and it would all happen in one round. This is what Bucharest is being subjected to because of Transylvanian interests, and this is how it will suffer again 100% at the next election.

That precisely what we cant allow to happen.

The sole concern of a doctor deciding whether or not an abortion makes sense must be 1. the law and 2. the health of the mother.

I also dont get where you see my arguing for casual abortions, I very much dont.

I simply argue that if an abortion can legally be done, there are no medical reasons not to do it and the mother is absolutely certain she wants it, the doctor doesnt get to reject her because of some ancient delusions.

Your argument is the same thats usually used against any welfare, that people will abuse it for dumb/selfish things.

528,"But this is at least partly because of how 'women'-centric things are sold as 'it's good because it's feminist'. So if it's not good it's bad because feminism sucks.

The Ghostbusters remake is announced as THE FEMINIST Gostbusters and it sucks, so feminism sucks. The Total Recall is announced as just the Total Recall remake who cares, it flops, so what. Even if (imo) it's worse than girl Ghostbusters. It doesn't hinge on masculinity.

I read Jia Tolentino's Trick Mirror last week and in her essay 'The Cult of the Difficult Woman' she makes the point that in the last twenty years there;s been a renewed appreciation for women who just don't give a shit. Whether it's Kim Kardashian wearing see-through clothes in pregnancy or Britney shaving her hair or Hillary accepting Trump's description 'nasty woman'. Yaaass queen!

But on the other hand that kind of cultural analysis of women daring to stand up against patriarchy or sexist comments just completely ignores what they are. It's not like by wearing high heels Kim K is actually making a feminist statement, or Hillary pushing Obama into the Libyan invasion is actually good. It just becomes a symbol. Pushing back = feminist.

And it has pervaded *all* of culture so far that the weakest pun just last week ('Trump can call his son Barron but he can't make him a baron') becomes an actual scandal. A maybe sexist joke about Sarah Huckabee Sanders eye shadow becomes a sexist attack. And maybe it is, but it has been reduced to just a signifier. 'You shouldn't attack a woman for her looks because that's sexist so now the victim is feminist'. 

I don't like Trump but I can name like five things I think he has done okay on, feminist goals are not one of them. But because 'a woman being attacked makes her feminist' has sort of engraved inteslf into the culture even completely anti-feminist women like SHS can now claim 'yas bitch' status.

The main problem beneath all this is that women are still singled out as exemplars of morality, both on the conservative side and on the feminist side, while maybe the goal should be to make female power, failure, and normalcy as accepted as male power, etc.

608,"&gt;I have to address this first:

&gt;&gt;Like Syrian Civil War which was partially caused by record breaking drought linked to climate change?

&gt;AHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHA

You can laugh, but laugherd doesn't change research:

&gt;[There is evidence that the 2007−2010 drought contributed to the conflict in Syria. It was the worst drought in the instrumental record, causing widespread crop failure and a mass migration of farming families to urban centers. Century-long observed trends in precipitation, temperature, and sea-level pressure, supported by climate model results, strongly suggest that anthropogenic forcing has increased the probability of severe and persistent droughts in this region, and made the occurrence of a 3-year drought as severe as that of 2007−2010 2 to 3 times more likely than by natural variability alone. We conclude that human influences on the climate system are implicated in the current Syrian conflict.](https://www.pnas.org/content/112/11/3241)

&amp;

&gt;[From 2006-2011, up to 60% of Syria’s land experienced, in the terms of one expert, “the worst long-term drought and most severe set of crop failures since agricultural civilizations began in the Fertile Crescent many millennia ago.”  According to a special case study from last year’s Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction (GAR), of the most vulnerable Syrians dependent on agriculture, particularly in the northeast governorate of Hassakeh (but also in the south), “nearly 75 percent…suffered total crop failure.” Herders in the northeast lost around 85% of their livestock, affecting 1.3 million people.](https://climateandsecurity.org/2012/02/29/syria-climate-change-drought-and-social-unrest/)

&gt;[The human and economic costs are enormous.  In 2009, the UN and IFRC reported that over 800,000 Syrians had lost their entire livelihood as a result of the droughts. By 2011, the aforementioned GAR report estimated that the number of Syrians who were left extremely “food insecure” by the droughts sat at about one million. The number of people driven into extreme poverty is even worse, with a UN report from last year estimating two to three million people affected.](https://climateandsecurity.org/2012/02/29/syria-climate-change-drought-and-social-unrest/)

&gt;[This has led to a massive exodus of farmers, herders and agriculturally-dependent rural families from the countryside to the cities. Last January, it was reported that crop failures (particularly the Halaby pepper) just in the farming villages around the city of Aleppo, had led “200,000 rural villagers to leave for the cities.” In October 2010, the New York Times highlighted a UN estimate that 50,000 families migrated from rural areas just that year, “on top of the hundreds of thousands of people who fled in earlier years.” In context of Syrian cities coping with influxes of Iraqi refugees since the U.S. invasion in 2003, this has placed additional strains and tensions on an already stressed and disenfranchised population.](https://climateandsecurity.org/2012/02/29/syria-climate-change-drought-and-social-unrest/)

&gt;[A NOAA study published last October in the Journal of Climate found strong and observable evidence that the recent prolonged period of drought in the Mediterranean littoral and the Middle East is linked to climate change. On top of this, the study also found worrying agreement between observed climate impacts, and future projections from climate models. A recent model of climate change impacts on Syria conducted by IFPRI, for example, projects that if current rates of global greenhouse gas emissions continue, yields of rainfed crops in the country may decline “between 29 and 57 percent from 2010 to 2050.”](https://climateandsecurity.org/2012/02/29/syria-climate-change-drought-and-social-unrest/)

&amp; 

&gt;[The Syrian conflict that began in 2012 has many roots, including long-standing political, religious, and social ideological disputes; economic dislocations from both global and regional factors; and worsening environmental conditions. This paper argues that key environmental factors include both direct and indirect consequences of water shortages, ineffective watershed management, and the impacts of climate variability and change on regional hydrology. Severe multiyear drought beginning in the mid-2000s, combined with inefficient and often unmodernized irrigation systems and water abstractions by other parties in the eastern Mediterranean, including especially Syria, contributed to the displacement of large populations from rural to urban centers, food insecurity for more than a million people, and increased unemployment—with subsequent effects on political stability. There is some evidence that the recent drought is an early indicator of the climatic changes that are expected for the region, including higher temperature, decreased basin rainfall and runoff, and increased water scarcity. ](https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/full/10.1175/WCAS-D-13-00059.1)

So, you can laugh at science, just like anti-vaxxers laugh to science.

&gt;The title of the OP's post is misleading then since she's not the PM yet.

The other parties pretty much have stated their support. The parliament doesn't vote on sundays, so the official vote will be next week. But it's pretty much decided already.

&gt; In the '90s and at the beginning of the 2000s they were predicting that we would ""burn""/s by now and nothing happened...

No. That was never the scientific consensus. You are making things up.

&gt;And how is it localized problem when millions of people with different values and cultures than ours are coming to our countries because of those ""localized problems""?

There aren't millions of people.

846,"Soft in the head means they just aren't cognitively the same as they once was, ""where did I put that, give me a minute to remember how to think before I think, okay now what was the topic""... opposite or ""sharp"" or ""quick"" I guess

Rigid like stuck in their ways. They ""thought one way for 30 years and it ain't done them no harm ain't changing now"" attitude. Things they believe with conviction become stronger with age even if they aren't gaining any information they're just becoming more confident in it

Dementia is tough to diagnose, most old people start to falter and slow down before they can pick it up in tests. The people around them notice it before they do, they start getting mad about people talking about their retirement like ""what you mean retire?! I've got another 15 years in me yet"", they can't hear as well, they can't see as well, they don't have the strength they once had, they shake, they're unsteady, they're more reliant on medications and not paying attention to the cognitive side effects, they're not fully there. Anyone who has been around a lot of old people notices when their mind is starting to go. They're as confident as ever right up  until someone makes them put down the tools before they hurt themselves (or for a metaphor in the case of whitecollar, before their heart explodes from the stress) and then they're depressed afterwards because they begin to feel useless.

This is why a lot of people find it so strange to recruit a leader from an old age retirement home essentially. and that's what 70+ is. Life expectancy is only typically 80 years. If they were working any other job they'd have been sent to retire 5-15 years ago and now they're being brought back to lead a country? that's mad",,/r/europe/comments/e7wwg3/she_sanna_marin_is_the_new_34_years_old_prime/fa7j3l0/,cara27hhh,1575835287

Controversy over former FAI (Soccer) Chief executive John Delaney's deep embellishment of funds rumbles on, with the rest of the governing board now implicated in large scale misuse of funds for Delaney's personal use. The minister for Sport cut all state funding from the FAI some months ago, and following Delaney's resignation has now suggested local-level funding may be partially restored.

Up to 20,000 jobs may be imminently lost if false compensation claims continue to be paid out at increasingly high rates, said fast food chain Supermac's CEO Patrick McDonagh.

The government has narrowly survived a confidence motion this week against Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy. Coming off the back of 4 dismal by-election results, Leo Varadkar's fine gael government now stands on very shaky ground, relying on the support of their main rivals Fianna Fáil in a confidence and supply agreement. Ministers are now mulling openly the prospect of a spring election, between February and May of next year.

On one side you argue that Russia is okay to invade countries cause US (along with I guess proto-US) is as imperialistic and powerful hence can do whatever they want until proven wrong. At the same time, you paint yourself white to advocate acceptance of genocides such as for Holodomor (which occurred not just in Ukraine, but Kazakhstan, I think Belarus etc). Tankies do argue that Holodomor wasn't a deliberate genocide towards Ukrainians, no one argues that there were millions starved to death due to irresponsible goals set by early USSR leaders and their cronies. So let's just agree that killing a whole bunch of people seems out of touch nowadays. To me, the main difference between the US and Russia is that at least inside the US you can trust the law. The side effect of people suing others over things like spilled hot coffee can't compare to the fact that in Russia you can't trust your own law - you are true in saying it's a fiction, inside Russia at least.

More complicated than that.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ex_post_facto_law

&gt;An *ex post facto* law (corrupted from Latin: *ex postfacto*, lit. 'out of the aftermath') is a law that retroactively changes the legal consequences (or status) of actions that were committed, or relationships that existed, before the enactment of the law. In criminal law, it may criminalize actions that were legal when committed; it may aggravate a crime by bringing it into a more severe category than it was in when it was committed; it may change the punishment prescribed for a crime, as by adding new penalties or extending sentences; or it may alter the rules of evidence in order to make conviction for a crime likelier than it would have been when the deed was committed.
&gt;
&gt;Conversely, a form of *ex post facto* law commonly called an amnesty law may decriminalize certain acts. (Alternatively, rather than redefining the relevant acts as non-criminal, it may simply prohibit prosecution; or it may enact that there is to be no punishment, but leave the underlying conviction technically unaltered.) A pardon has a similar effect, in a specific case instead of a class of cases (though a pardon more often leaves the conviction itself – the finding of guilt – unaltered, and occasionally pardons are refused for this reason). 
).
&gt;
&gt;Other legal changes may alleviate possible punishments (for example by replacing the death sentence with lifelong imprisonment) retroactively. Such legal changes are also known by the Latin term *in mitius*.
&gt;
&gt;Some common-law jurisdictions do not permit retroactive criminal legislation, though new precedent generally applies to events that occurred before the judicial decision. *Ex post facto* laws are expressly forbidden by the United States Constitution in Article 1, Section 9, Clause 3 (with respect to federal laws) and Article 1, Section 10 (with respect to state laws). In some nations that follow the Westminster system of government, such as the United Kingdom, *ex post facto* laws are technically possible, because the doctrine of parliamentary supremacy allows Parliament to pass any law it wishes. In a nation with an entrenched bill of rights or a written constitution, *ex post facto* legislation may be prohibited.
&gt;
&gt;While American jurisdictions generally prohibit *ex post facto* laws, European countries apply the principle of *lex mitior* (""the milder law""). It provides that, if the law has changed after an offense was committed, the version of the law that applies is the one that is more advantageous for the accused. This means that *ex post facto* laws apply in European jurisdictions to the extent that they are the milder law.[1]

&gt; **United Kingdom**
&gt;
&gt;In the United Kingdom, *ex post facto* laws are frowned upon,[by whom?] but are permitted by virtue of the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty. Historically, all acts of Parliament before 1793 were *ex post facto* legislation, inasmuch as their date of effect was the first day of the session in which they were passed. This situation was rectified by the Acts of Parliament (Commencement) Act 1793.
&gt;
&gt;Some laws are still passed retrospectively: e.g., the Pakistan Act 1990 (by which the United Kingdom amended its legislation consequent to the Commonwealth of Nations having re-admitted Pakistan as a member) was one such law; despite being passed on 29 June 1990, section 2 subsection 3 states that ""This Act shall be deemed to have come into force on 1st October 1989"", nine months before it was enacted.[23]
&gt;
&gt;Retrospective criminal laws are prohibited by Article 7 of the European Convention on Human Rights, to which the United Kingdom is a signatory, but several noted legal authorities have stated their opinion that parliamentary sovereignty takes priority even over this.[24][25] For example, the War Crimes Act 1991 created an *ex post facto* jurisdiction of British courts over war crimes committed during the Second World War. Another important example of a case which shows the doctrine of parliamentary supremacy in action is *Burmah Oil Co Ltd v Lord Advocate*, which retrospectively changed the law on compensation resulting from scorched earth actions in Burma during the war. The decision of the courts was overridden with retrospective effect by the War Damage Act 1965. More recently, the Police (Detention and Bail) Act 2011 retroactively overrode a controversial court judgment resulting from an error in the drafting of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 that would potentially have invalidated thousands of criminal convictions.
&gt;
&gt;One example of an *ex post facto* criminal law in the UK is the Criminal Justice Act 2003. This law allows people acquitted of murder and certain other serious offences to be retried if there is ""new, compelling, reliable and substantial evidence"" that the acquitted person really was guilty. This Act applies retroactively and can be used to re-prosecute people who were acquitted before it came into force in 2005, or even before it was passed in 2003. As a result, two of the defendants who were acquitted in the murder of Stephen Lawrence were allowed to be retried, even though this murder occurred in 1993 and the defendants had been acquitted in 1996. Many people have criticized the Criminal Justice Act because of its essential abolition of prohibition against both ex post facto and double jeopardy laws.[26]
&gt;
&gt;Taxation law has on multiple occasions been changed to retrospectively disallow tax avoidance schemes.[27] The most significant example known concerns double-taxation treaty arrangements where the Finance Act 2008 with BN66 retrospectively amended 1987 legislation, creating large tax liabilities for 3,000 people where no liability existed before. More recently, the so-called ""2019 Loan Charge"", coming in from 5 April 2019 and going back 20 years retrospectively, has triggered an Early Day Motion[28] in the UK Parliament and the establishment of a Loan Charge Action Group. [29] It has since transpired that Mel Stride, Financial Secretary to the Treasury and Paymaster General of Her Majesty's Treasury, misled UK Parliament stating that ""the arrangements entered into by those who are in scope of this measure [the 2019 Loan Charge] were not legal when they were entered into, even though they may have been entered into in the past"". The Loan Charge Action Group has since written to demand a formal apology and correction of parliamentary record.[30]",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/e7scnc/boris_johnson_unveils_strict_limits_on_unskilled/fa6vwmg/,duisThias,1575829081

980,"We pretty much agree on all that.


In defense of NATO, it serves EU interests as well as the US. 
As do American bases around the world.
Less spending, while without immediate danger, leads to less preparedness overall.


It is not just capital purchases (which certainly benefit the US industry) but also personnel training, intelligence, infrastructure, etc. Which have benefits to all economies beyond basic tactical values.
E.g. development of fighter jets lead to better and safer civilian aviation, development of field hospitals improves civilian trauma protocols, military bases lead to cleaner water and better highways, etc

I brought Trumps’s point because, overall, EU nations seem less inclined to think about military as a stability force and more as a provocative one. Thus justifying the lesser spend.
While in theory it sounds like it has higher moral ground, the reality is that other world powers exist that respect force only.
Therefore, an argument can be made that without the US maintaining these NATO bases, the EU allies would lose a lot of clout as well. Just an IMHO, YMMV.

I don't say Danzigers hated the name ""Prussia"" itself, but they didn't particularly enjoy being ruled directly from Berlin either. Remember, that annexation by the Prussian state resulted in an economic downfall of Gdańsk, that had previously been the only port of a big Commonwealth and after the partitions its role was reduced to one of countless ports scattered along the Prussian shore and since it didn't have a good connection with main Prussian, then German industrial hubs (the only main ""road"" it had was the Vistula but it ended at the Russian border just down behind Toruń), throughout the 19th century Gdańsk totally lost its former economic importance to Stettin-Swinemunde and Konigsberg. How could Danzigers be happy about it? Gdańsk doesn't even have a 'grandiose' urban planning scheme from the 19th century and its districts from that era look rather bland when compared to what Stettin or Konigsberg could boast about.

When you read the memories and diaries of members of the Polish community in the pre-war (pre-1939) Gdańsk you can see that they differentiate between old Danziger merchant families (that weren't hostile to Poles, a lot of them had Polish roots or at least drops of Polish blood in their veins and thought Gdańsk should seek an agreement and some kind of modus vivendi with Poland to secure a better future for Gdańsk and to regain its former glory) and ""new"" Danzigers, mostly officials, often just sent to Gdańsk by Prussians and then by Nazis to enforce the ""gleichschaltung"" policy and turn Danzigers into typical Germans they had never been before.

***In Ukraine, in September 2019, 54% of the Ukrainians responded that they were positive or very positive about Russia, 35% were negative or very negative, 12% were hesitating;***

[***https://www.kiis.com.ua/?lang=eng&amp;cat=reports&amp;id=899&amp;page=1&amp;y=2019***](https://www.kiis.com.ua/?lang=eng&amp;cat=reports&amp;id=899&amp;page=1&amp;y=2019)

And mind you that's after 5 years of brainwashing when opposition media were almost suppressed in Ukraine and any pro-Russian comment on a Facebook could land you in secret police prison for ""separatism"".

For Russia public opinion of Ukrainians isn't the problem. Problem are Ukrainian oligarchs who know that they will loose power in Ukraine just like their Russian counterparts did when Putin took over. They will be fighting for ""independence"" to the last bit. Just like Lukashenko is doing in Belarus for the same reason. When independent, they are little kings and queens on the fief. When part of Russia, they will have to answer to Kremlin, and Kremlin won't let them rob Ukraine like they do now.",,/r/europe/comments/e7slu9/its_time_for_ukraine_to_let_the_donbass_go/fa6614a/,arrasas,1575821328

Are you aware that such a deal would completely close off the international water route to Turkish straights right? That would mean every ship that wants to pass there would have to pass through territorial waters of Greece.

Something something *right of conquest*... So according to international law, Arabs definitely had a right to those lands, as they had conquered them.

However, after the 19th century, the right of conquest was codified in international law so that it could only be used after a treaty between the conquering and conquered nations. And after that, the UN entered the fray, and its resolutions became international law. This all means that right of conquest doesn't exist anymore as it was, so Israel's occupation of Palestinian lands is unlawful. Only the territories given to it by the UN are lawfully part of Israel.

1070,"Two very different histories are told at the south end of Freedom Square, in the heart of the Hungarian capital.

A stone statue of the Archangel Gabriel, a symbol of Hungary, stands at the edge of the square looking innocent and unaware while an eagle – obviously crafted to resemble the one on the German coat of arms – dives toward him with extended claws. The date 1944 is attached to the eagle's ankle. ""In memory of the victims,"" reads the inscription at the base of the monument, as if the Second World War, and Hungary's role in it, began with the Nazi occupation of the country that year.

Facing the monument is a reminder of all that's left unsaid by the angel and the eagle. Laid on the sidewalk in a long row are the personal effects – including a crumpled brown suitcase, a pair of eyeglasses missing a lens and a pair of blue toddler's shoes – belonging to some of the hundreds of thousands of Hungarian Jews who died in the Holocaust. Among the dead were tens of thousands of Jewish refugees from Poland who were deported to German-occupied territories prior to 1944 by a Hungarian government that was allied to Nazi Germany for the first five years of the war.




Building of the monument was finished in the middle of the night shortly after Prime Minister Viktor Orban won re-election in 2014. But the Federation of Jewish Communities in Hungary has condemned its erection and declared a boycott of all activities connected with what was supposed to be an official year of Holocaust remembrance.



""This monument is a lie,"" said David Tucker, a Jewish activist and a member of the opposition Socialist party. ""They say the Holocaust happened because of the German occupation. They don't talk about the political situation in Hungary in the 1920s, '30s and '40s. It's very dangerous, I think.""


Critics of the monument – which depicts Hungary as the Archangel Gabriel being attacked by a German imperial eagle – say it absolves the Hungarian state and Hungarians of their active role in sending some 450,000 Jews to their deaths during the occupation.",,/r/europe/comments/e7vi78/controversial_monument_to_hungarian_victims_of/fa676eg/,ApprehensiveCabinet6,1575821792

1107,"If we’re looking at modern history (from the 1800’s) then yes, Prussia took over Gdańsk during the third partition of Poland and became in incorporated as part of Prussia in 1793.

If we’re looking at the complete history of Gdańsk: it is for 712 years a part of Poland, meaning that for 71% of its existance it was incorporated into Poland.

The parts of history that Gdańsk was under Teutonic/Prussian/German rule are the parts that Gdańsk fared the worst in its history. Gdańsk didnt benefit under any circumstance of being part of any German state or order. Low development of the city, losing its position as the greatest Baltic trading post as well as its ruined economy were a direct result of German interference. German states always sought to eliminate any existance of Poles, Polish language or Polish culture from the city.

The history of Gdańsk of war with German states like the Brandenburgers and the Teutonic Knights, the latter backstabbing Poland after bring asked by the Polish king for help. The Teutonic Knights even slaughtered the German colony of Gdańsk in the 14th century just because they were competing with the Knights’ town of Elbing. Also, German knights punished the towns populace, back then majority of Polish people, when they supported the Polish king.

Also the wars with Sweden of the 17th and 18th century were bad for the city.

This is not me saying that German people or the German culture is bad. Im saying that German states/kings/governments were bad for the prosperity and development of Gdańsk. The Germans of Gdańsk were always in favor of remaining with Poland.

Gdańsk wanted to remain a part of Poland because of the Polish kings allowing Gdańsk to flourish as a free city with exclusive rights. Most of those „Germans” spoke Polish as well, and they never determined their national identity to be of a German or Prussian state. The inhabitants of Gdańsk, which mostly spoke both German and Polish, revolted whenever there was rule of a foreign state after wars.

That the majority of people in Gdańsk/Danzig were Germans, doesn’t make a city automatically German with a German culture. Gdańsk was something special, a result from the tolerance of religion, culture and language in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Those people were allowed to have their own culture and their own language, with Polish being a secondary language in schools.

After Prussia took over Gdańsk during the third partition of Poland in 1793, there were several uprisings by the inhabitants of Gdańsk against Prussia being crushed. Prussia made sure that the Polish language was diminished and Polish people were expelled from Gdańsk. Poles faced discrimination after they started to settle again in Gdańsk mid 19th century, which was back then against international law.

Of course it is correct that Germans had a lot of influence on the history of the city, but few people can explain correctly how exactly that influence has been. The point here is: Gdańsk/Danzig is a historically legimiate part of Poland.

What happened after the second world war, with Poland expelling Germans from the city, is wrong but definitely understandable after Germany murdered 20% of the population and burned and destroyed almost all historically priceless buildings and artefacts of Poland, while being sold off by the West to the Soviets. Its a miracle that Kraków survived the war.

Throughout history of Gdańsk it were German states that were causing war, murdering and destruction on Poland and its culture over and over again, while Poland showed tolerance in its own country for German people, its language and culture. Everyone who „thinks” this is not the case is an ignorant fool.

Clive Lewis is now an obscure member of the Labour Party. He quit the cabinet and is now pretty much disowned by the leadership. He’s ironically in the same position Jeremy Corbyn was for a number of years. If it takes him as long as it took Corbyn to rise to leader then maybe you’re right but I don’t see it happening.

congrats you now know what a ghetto is, which isnt what fits your definition.

&gt; because you do understand what this is being refered to.

i know, brown people, according to you.
but the definition applies to ALL immigrant communities.

&gt; So it might be for white pole, because some german ubermensch might call him polnische schweine or something like that. Immigration is not a easy stuff, which will never be understood by westerners, who are not immigrating in such numbers.

i agree completely.

&gt; And it's good they are incarcerated - they break the law, they should be punished. See? Easy.

i also agree, but what makes you think i wouldnt? what makes you think other migrant communities do not think its a good thing their own criminals are locked up? because thats what you are implying here.\
as though some migrant communities enjoy the crime label being attached to them.
what is your point here?

&gt; Your brexit argumentation is lacking a bit of info.

no it really isnt, the Brits were not happy with the increased immigration from eastern europe.

&gt; So far, you are just countering me based on my polishness, nothing more. You are hidden racist with underlying stereotypes you have learnt from your ancestors.

again, you only see what you want to see.
you make the distinction between good and bad migrants, generalizing, i point out you are wrong.
i point out how your definition of ghettos are wrong, especially in western europe.
there are no run down neighbourhoods as far as i can tell.

you point out how there arent asian ghettos, yet there are.
not to mention rampant crime from asian gangs.

you only see what you want to see, which is why i think you are a bigot
and how is what im doing racist, but what you are doing isnt?
you are quick to throw the racist card around when it suits you, but not once mentioned or cared about the even worse treatment muslims go through, which you contribute to.

Also you: :completely ignores the fact that an average Russian is very poor and has low social mobility, so ""just change countries bro"" is either downright impossible or would reduce their quality of life dramatically, especially since the whole world is experiencing a tide of anti-migrant and even cold war style anti-Russian opinions:

&gt;Oh, dear, you don't know anything about the history of your own country. UNR was recognized by the Central Powers and Russia.

First - I'm not your dear.

Second - *who the fucking is talking about UNR, you fucking dolt*? The states in questions are literally war-time Nazi occupied parts of Poland and Ukraine.

&gt;Maybe because they are significant for many people, even after decades of denial and repressions?

If Nazi collaborators, murderers and antisemites are ""significant to many people"", well maybe... just maybe these people are a bit fucked up?

Don't get me wrong. UPA *are* important figures in Ukraine's history. They should be taught about, analyzed and maybe even understood. But making them outright spotless *heroes*? Fuck off with that shit. They're *barely* even *morally grey*.

&gt;But that doesn't matter, because you are trying to switch the topic from Russian-Ukrainian war to some unrelated stuff

It's a discussion of the significance of symbols, bud.

&gt;That's not true - only those names are changed which were related to Communist regime.

You can literally Google the list. Yes, the majority of changed names are related to commies and are fair. However, for example, the street named after Lev Tolstoy was renamed. The streets named after heroes of WW2 are a grey area, but they're also getting changed since Ukrainian government pushes for this extremely weird disconnect of Ukraine from ""Великої Вітчизняної"" to ""радянсько-німецької війни"" (that's how it sounds in schools now, too).

I’m from an area that was literally 50-50 ethnically before the war, and now it is almost entirely polish. 

I’m absolutely obsessed with the forgotten German heritage of my area. 

My grandma has a very old “naumann” sewing machine. Turns out that after the war when the Russians were marching west, a lot of Germans ran away and left with their belongings, but for months after the war people tried to come back to their old houses. You’ve gotta understand that these people lived door to door with polish and mostly got along, it was the external forces that Caused the biggest suffering. But back to the machine. Turns out that a German lady who lost her husband on the eastern front attempted coming back to her home village. Two Young polish boys stole her horses and didn’t let her back into her old house. My great grandma (polish) kicked off and went there and got her horses back. The lady stayed over for a few days in our house but eventually it sank in that she can’t stay. My great grandmother gave her a massive bread (apparently it was a weeks worth of food for her and 3 kids) and the German lady left west to settle in Germany. She left the sewing machine for my great grandmother as a thank you for getting the horses back and letting her stay. Her surname was “Reiss” or something similar.

Russia is the legal successor of the USSR, while the US is not the legal successor of the UK...

1339,"It is very hard to get proper numbers about immigrants living in France due to the French state not recording data about ethnicity. The only source I can find that seem reliable is a INSEE census from 2008 that show us that 4 million Arabs, 1 million Africans, 500 000 Chinese and 400 000 Turks were living in France. Yet this was in 2008, the numbers must have risen considerably since then. 

 [https://teo-english.site.ined.fr/](https://teo-english.site.ined.fr/) 

So, lets us look at immigration to France. According to what I can see France gets about 200 000 immigrants on a yearly basis. Out of those 200 000 thousand, about 110 000 are none-Europeans. That means that from 2008 to 2018 France have received another million of none-European immigrants. 

 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration\_to\_France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_to_France) 

Therefore, in 2019 there, probably, are about 7 million none-Europeans out of a population 67 million. Might be more and might be less. Hard to say without proper data. And then there is still asylum seekers, family reunification, illegal immigrants and the fact that Africans, Arabs, Turks and the rest of the none-Europeans have more children then native Europeans.",,/r/europe/comments/e7q2gl/france_in_100_years_german_poster_from_1930/fa404wg/,Helpwithwarhammer,1575799520

1343,"I'm talking about objects to bully. Far right loves to use other ethnic groups as scapegoats.

This propaganda was from 1930's Germany, they were the ones who became Nazis. Remember how many of our countrymen these monsters have killed. Shouldn't it serve as proof of where this rhetoric leads?

*First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out—

     Because I was not a socialist.

Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out—
     Because I was not a trade unionist.

Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—
     Because I was not a Jew.

Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.

A longer version by the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust, a charity established by the UK government, is as follows:[4]

First they came for the Communists
And I did not speak out
Because I was not a Communist

Then they came for the Socialists
And I did not speak out
Because I was not a Socialist

Then they came for the trade unionists
And I did not speak out
Because I was not a trade unionist

Then they came for the Jews
And I did not speak out
Because I was not a Jew

Then they came for me
And there was no one left
To speak out for me*

Please let me know if you have suggestions to make this roundup better for /r/europe. I can search for posts based off keywords in the title, URL and flair. And I can also search for comments.

If you would like this roundup sent to your reddit inbox every day send me a message with the subject ['europe'](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=subredditsummarybot&amp;subject=europe&amp;message=x). Or if you only want a weekly roundup, use the subject ['europe weekly'](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=subredditsummarybot&amp;subject=europe%20weekly&amp;message=x)

However, I can do more.. you can have me search  for any keywords you want on any subreddit you want. Send a message with the subject ['set europe'](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=subredditsummarybot&amp;subject=set%20europe&amp;message=200%0A25%2C%20keyword1%2C%20another keyphrase%2C%20last example) and in the message: specify a number of upvotes that must be reached, and then an optional list of keywords you want to search for, separated by commas. You can have as many lines as you'd like, as long as they follow this format:

    200  
    50, keyword1, another keyphrase, last example

  You can also do ['set europe weekly'](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=subredditsummarybot&amp;subject=set%20europe%20weekly&amp;message=200%0A25%2C%20keyword1%2C%20another keyphrase%2C%20last example) And you can replace europe with any subreddit.

Budapest nightlife does contain a lot of dodgy prostitutes, but they are only seabel if you are looking for them in bad parts of the city. And even more, you can't find many prostites selling their ""services"" openly in other cites like Szeged where I live.

On the other hand while I was in Belgium (I think the same goes for the Netherlands too I just never visited a big city there) I saw brothels operating openly and not just in metropolis cites but even in lovely 200000ish people cities too.
I think normalising prostitution is just wrong because it sends a messege to normal citizens that it's just a service like a haircut and there is nothing to be ashamed of.

1505,"I ate plenty of Moldovan vine grapes my entire childhood. They're grapes. I really like them compared to what you get in Western supermarkets because Western supermarkets often prioritise more easily commercially exploitable variants that have larger fruit and are easier to transport, store, etc and look better, also have no seeds due to being infertile hybrids. 

However wine grapes are grown all over the world. 

The best raisins and grapes I've ever had were from Turkey. I am willing to believe Turkish grapes are inherently better than Moldovan ones because grapes love sun and warmth, Turkey has more of that. Turkey also has probably some of the most famous honey in the world, even Ancient Greeks noted that. Turkey has a lot of good stuff, including incredibly beautiful countryside and history quite possibly richer than any country in the world, I mean Katal Hyuk, Greek city states, Byzantines, Ottomans... 

Moldova isn't unique. It should rejoin Romania and seek its fortunes with its former mother-country. Half of Moldovans already hold Romanian passports anyway. Moldova doesn't deserve prosperity more than most of its neighbours. Ukraine has literally everything and it's poor. So does Turkey. Both of those countries should be getting richer, whereas imo there is no good future for Moldova unless it can rejoin Romania.",Apparently Serbia according to /u/cLnYze19N,/r/europe/comments/e7itsp/forest_cover_in_europe_oc/fa2ojym/,Aemilius_Paulus,1575784655

Parties faking out who they are is pretty common in Poland and i would love some proper stability for most of dumb people who don't know which parties are what exactly. I remember after AWS fell down how quickly those people like rats found themselves elsewhere. Parties should represent ideologies and people should sign up to those ideologies. This was also the same thing when LPR fell down and Samoobrona.

Change where people shouldn't change their colors after they were chosen by people is something i already wanted for decades. That someone is representing people who chose him, if people chose him as some party member then he should stay in it until his cadence runs out and represent them.

Change about not being able to change party when you run as candidate or member in previous election is also great. It would dissalow jumping ship for people who are in it for something else than ideology. They can still jump ship but that would require 4 year period in which they were not member or candidate for party.

Those changes basically kills old faces who fail with their parties and stops them from forming new parties with new colors with same people hoping they will fake news people into thinking those are actually new parties.

On other hand this will be beneficial for new people who start new parties free from old faces.",,/r/europe/comments/e7ea2w/fidesz_with_one_adjustment_would_dictate_the/fa2yjzn/,perkeljustshatonyou,1575788408

You're not alone and nobody honestly will probably spend too much time helping. Ukraine has worse corruption because there is more to steal. Russia is aiding that corruption. But Russia also has even greater corruption within itself. Who should clean all this up? 

Only we can help ourselves. Georgia should be an inspiration for the rest. Even with the Russian invasion and with *intense* meddling for the entirety of the 1990s and 2000s from Russia, they still somehow managed to reform themselves. And btw, I took a class on Georgian history 1990-2008, it's mental how much worse the Russian meddling there was compared to many other post-Soviet nations (though Ukraine is an exception).

But yes, unionism has grown from a taboo, “extremist” ideea that wasn’t even spoken of before, to an actual official “future path” for us. Of course, it isn’t a majority political idea yet, but it’s certainly growing. We should have done it when we seceded from the soviet union, but both of our countries had soviet sympathizers as presidents at the time (as opposed to estonia for example, who immediately revoked citizenship of people who were brought from other parts of russia to colonize the land, while we did the opposite)

&gt;You shouldn't care what I consider aggresive behiavour, but don't be surprised when you have no support or face hostilities.
&gt;Turkey economy lives on mercy of Europe, and you should be avare of that.  
  
It's true. Turkey needs to start building more trade with and make more trade deals with Africa, Asia, Eurasia and Latin America rather than being so dependent on Europe in trade, and also needs to invest in innovation and technology.
  
&gt;In extent, your military power is also stronger thanks to the EU and NATO.    
     
Not true. While NATO helped Turkey modernize some equipment, most equipment Turkey received from the US is outdated. In addition, Turkey was denied many good systems like the Patriots, Abrams tanks, Apache helicopters and others while eben countries like Saudi Arabia and Egypt were sold those systems despite their aggression, being dictatorships and being non-NATO actors.    
     
You know why? Because they could switch to being Russian clients, and America doesn't want that. The US wants to build coalition.   
    
Do you think if Turkey had never joined NATO, the US and NATO would just allow the Soviet Union to invade Turkey and own Bosphorus?   
    
How much more would the US invest in a non-NATO Turkey to keep it from changing alliances? I suggest you take a look at how much they were investing in Iran during the reign of the Shah, Turkey is bordering Russia and Europe instead.  
   
Even today, letting Turkey become another Iran (former ally become enemy and a Russian ally) would be a huge failure on US side, no matter how much they threaten.   
   
But it's unfortunately true that Turkey is dependent on trade with Europe and needs a new vision.

    
&gt;If you continue to behave like a rabbid dog, you will be put to heal. EU and the west are slow to react, but when they do, it will last.

1593,"I disagree with you on interpretation.

People are choosing candidates who represent (or not) parties. It shouldn't be possible to switch colors after that because voters voted only once and they chose those candidates when they described themselves as chosen color or not. They are there to represent people not themselves. It is simply undemocratic if someone gets chosen by people as member of party A and then runs to party B when parliament starts. Those people wouldn't chose that candidate if he described himself as color B candidate.

Other rules also have different interpretations. Like case of not forming coalitions and ban on switching colors if someone represented some party cadence ago. It basically disallows election fraud where people who are unpopular try to for coalitions or new parties that try to pain those candidates in new light as if they were not members of previous unpopular parties. They CAN still change their colors but they would have to go away from politics for 4 years. Above also aplies to party name changes.

1622,"&gt;I remember that I had a religious teacher in second grade, and I was terrified by what she told us about hell.

Same experience, I think I was either first grade or kindergarten, some religious fuck missionary told me tales or ending of the world and punishing sinners, it really scared me and left an impression for some time. It's worse than parents beating you, I took a slap in  the face with much more stride than that. 

Fucking human scum, targeting vulnerable, impressionable young minds, minds unaided by the wisdom, intelligence and logic of a more mature mind. I regret a lot of things that USSR did, but I wish USSR did more to stamp out religion. Russian Orthodox Church in particular is a vile, backwards institution that literally calls for the death of gays and trans people, they make Putin look like the paragon of virtue. They have held Russia back for several centuries, resisting any Western humanist and liberalising movements. 

I spent a year in a Jesuit Uni and I gained deep respect for the more reserved and (in the US) more tolerant views of the Jesuit professors/clergy. We had a gay group called ""Skittles"" haha. It was quite nice. And although Catholics did it in the past, I don't see Catholics in developed countries going around and scaring kids with tales of the tortures of hell. Though it's definitely still going on, just depends where. 

Religious people are welcome to their religion, as long as they keep it to themselves. Trouble is, so many fervently religious people just can't shut the fuck up about it, because both Christianity and Islam makes it your duty to convert people. Those Christians and Muslims who leave you alone are usually not of very strong faith anyway, so basically a good Christian or Muslim is supposed to be an asshole to others. 

This is also why I respect Reform Jews so much, like almost all Jews, they don't seek to proselytise. The foreskin thing kinda sucks, but to be honest most Jews seem to be OK with it even when they grow up, it's not the greatest evil in the world even if I don't like it. What I don't get is why American Gentiles keep doing it.

&gt; All day long we seemed to dawdle through a country which was full of beauty of every kind. Sometimes we saw little towns or castles on the top of steep hills such as we see in old missals; sometimes we ran by rivers and streams which seemed from the wide stony margin on each side of them to be subject to great floods.

-

&gt;Before us lay a green sloping land full of forests and woods, with here and there steep hills, crowned with clumps of trees or with farmhouses, the blank gable end to the road. There was everywhere a bewildering mass of fruit blossom—apple, plum, pear, cherry; and as we drove by I could see the green grass under the trees spangled with the fallen petals. In and out amongst these green hills of what they call here the “Mittel Land” ran the road, losing itself as it swept round the grassy curve, or was shut out by the straggling ends of pine woods, which here and there ran down the hillsides like tongues of flame.

-

&gt; Beyond the green swelling hills of the Mittel Land rose mighty slopes of forest up to the lofty steeps of the Carpathians themselves. Right and left of us they towered, with the afternoon sun falling full upon them and bringing out all the glorious colours of this beautiful range, deep blue and purple in the shadows of the peaks, green and brown where grass and rock mingled, and an endless perspective of jagged rock and pointed crags, till these were themselves lost in the distance, where the snowy peaks rose grandly. Here and there seemed mighty rifts in the mountains, through which, as the sun began to sink, we saw now and again the white gleam of falling water.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tricolour_(flag)

&gt;A tricolour or tricolor is a type of flag or banner design with a triband design which originated in the 16th century as a symbol of republicanism, liberty or indeed revolution. The flags of France, Italy, Romania, Mexico, and Ireland were all first adopted with the formation of an independent republic in the period of the French Revolution to the Revolutions of 1848, with the exception of the Irish tricolour, which dates from 1848 but was not popularised until the Easter Rising in 1916 and adopted in 1919.

-

&gt;With the formation of French client republics after 1795, the revolutionary tricolour was exported and adopted more widely in Europe, by the Republic of Alba 1796 (red-blue-yellow), the Cisalpine Republic 1797 (Transpadane Republic, green-white-red), the Cisrhenian Republic 1797 (green-white-red), the Anconine Republic 1797 (blue-yellow-red), the Roman Republic 1798 (black-white-red), the Helvetic Republic 1798 (green-yellow-red; canton of Neuchatel 1848), the Parthenopean Republic 1799 (blue-yellow-red), and the Principality of Lucca and Piombino 1805 (blue-white-red). Thus providing the format for most of modern Europe's national flags, from the flag of Italy, to the flag of Germany, flag of Ireland, flag of Belgium, flag of Romania, flag of Bulgaria, flag of Moldova, and others around the World such as the flag of Cameroon, flag of Chad, flag of Ivory Coast, flag of Gabon, flag of Guinea, flag of Mali, and flag of Nigeria.
&gt;
&gt;The green-white-red tricolour remained a symbol of republicanism throughout the 19th century and was adopted as national flag by a number of states following the Revolutions of 1848. It was also adopted by the Kingdom of Sardinia (inherited by the Kingdom of Italy 1861).

To add interest, you know the word for hippopotamus?

**Dobhareach**.

As I’m sure you know, this literally means “water-horse”.

And what’s the Irish language name for Gweedore? Gaoth Dobhair (Windy waters).

Dobhar is an archaic word for water, sharing a proto-Celtic and proto-Indo-European heritage with the Welsh word “dwr”.

It seems likely that the word was mostly used to describe deep or murky waters, and from that got its infrequent modern usage of “dark, dull, obscure”.","Wicklow, Ireland",/r/europe/comments/e7fbmi/water_in_different_parts_of_europe/fa14qz5/,LordofHerons,1575764502
1881,"&gt; This kind of thinking is half of the problem we have. The Russian speaking minority mostly consists of normal people who lived here for decades and the first people who were born in independent Estonia are almost 30 years old. They are not an immigrant nation, they are a minority in our country and part of our society just like anyone else. 

Of course most Russian-speakers are ""normal people"" and they've lived here for quite a while, but... they kinda are immigrants. They live almost exclusively in urban areas, most families have no long history in Estonia, but most importantly, a lot of them still live in a parallel Russian information field which makes their views and values much closer to Russia than to Estonians. Russian-speakers basically check every box for a typical immigrant community. This is, of course, simplification and generalization, but that's how I see it.

&gt;Integration is a 2-way street, if you label a large part of society as 'immigrant nation who tried to obliterate mine' you are going to get absolutely nowhere.

I'm not convinced by that. Of course if you label Russians with ""you oppressed us"", it's plain stupid and leads to nowhere. But I think it's generally accepted that immigrants adapt to the locals and not vice versa. I mean, I'd have nothing against improving my Russian (I don't feel I'm obliged to do it, though), but at the same time, I'm unwilling to accept many viewpoints of Russians that are taken from Russian media. 

NATO example is great here, because Russians have objectively no more reasons to oppose NATO than Estonians, yet they do purely because Russian media tells them to. Hence, I consider their opinion completely worthless. Not that I'd want to discard their opinion, but I can see they are following interests of Moscow and not Tallinn.

1891,"&gt; The Russian speaking minority also consists of people, who speak a language that was forced upon this country to extinguish our own. 

Sure, but they cannot be possibly held personally responsible for that.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Many of the Russians are still defensive about interpreting the Soviet occupation in a negative way and many still refuse to integrate.  
&gt;  
&gt;I honestly think that having a drop-by-drop integration is the only solution acceptable to both Estonians and Russians. Yet this solution takes a long, long time to evaporate the ethnic tensions in our society.

I agree with you on that. However, I think there's still a lot more room for wider, more effective policies (education, etc).

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Yes, they absolutely are. To deny it is to deny the illegality of the Soviet occupation.  
&gt;  
&gt;Being an immigrant nation does not mean that people cannot move on and cannot integrate and become beneficial members of the society, but nothing, ever will change the fact that they are an immigrant nation here.

I am not sure what is the connection to the occupation.

I put 'immigrant nation' in quotation marks because it's not actually a term. The russian-speaking minority consists of several nationalities: Russians, Ukrainians, Jews, Belarusians, etc. Some members of this minority are immigrants, others are not. Also, are you seriously claiming that members of this minority are not productive members of society?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; That's the thing, something that you as a foreigner may not understand - to a large degree, they are not part of our society. We have two societies in Estonia, ours and theirs, and rather few are part of both. 

There is one society by definition. Just because you have a minority social group that generally does not communicate with the dominant social group, it does not mean that they are somehow not part of the society as a whole. Saying there are 2 societies just reinforces the 'us vs. them' mindset. Everyone is in this together.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;And this is the thing, it's not. It's like a buzzword often claimed, but it's not true and stating it over and over again will not get any one of us closer to solving any problem.  
&gt;  
&gt;Foreigners integrate, the locals don't - this is how it works. Either you integrate, or your descendants will. If you don't then you can live in a parallel society.

""this is how it works"" isn't really a valid argument in Reddit debates :D

Of course, just stating things won't get anyone anywhere. Integration *is* a two-way street, even if it's not pleasant to admit it. It's not the Russian-speaking minorities problem, it's a problem for all. You can't let people live in a parallel society, that's the whole point of integration. I think that Estonians have more work to do than the Russians. Yes, it's not fair and nobody wants to help people who have separatism inside of their head, but all of this is a result of poor integration, a catch-22. 

Successful integration is an exercise in compassion for both sides. Immigrants need to learn the language and values, locals need to learn acceptance and tolerance. It's the only way out.",,/r/europe/comments/e7e85h/ethnic_composition_of_tallinn_18202018/fa15bz2/,cherrycarrot,1575764884

The story is complicated and largely hindered by local corruption, as one might expect, articles about the issues are mostly in Romanian, but here's a short rundown video done by Agent Green, a local environmental protection nonprofit NGO that has been central in unearthing these problems, original here: ~~edited-fb-link /agentgreen.ro/videos/1054842724574438/?v=1054842724574438~~, streamable alternative here: https://streamable.com/og94u

Netflix also included information on illegal logging in Romania in one of the episodes of their ""Broken"" series, but I haven't seen it personally so its most likely that they might've talked about the Austrian company ""Holzindustrie Schweighofer"" that our local corrupts collaborated with and not Ikea, since that story line has gained much more traction in local media than the Ikea one. Also, apparently the Netflix filming crew got attacked by the Romanian loggers, which is not surprising considering foresters have been murdered by illegal loggers in the past few years.

All in all, very complicated and deep-rooted problem fueled by our corrupt officials that have impeded the activity of NGOs, thus information is rather slow to surface.

Admittedly, the Germans (more specifically, the Prussians) didn't do much to make them feel welcome once they were part of the German Empire. They didn't even grant them proper statehood and treated them worse than most of their colonials, which was the main reason why Alsatian representatives engaged in abstentionism like the Irish did in the UK.

To label me a ""Christian"" anything is a greater comedy; I decided Christianity was too warlike in practice when I was 11.

As for a banishment of the Sinnestrieb...  Hilarious.  I have a self-written porn story open on another monitor; I earned my traumas in Bonobianism; I know the viewpoint where sex becomes dull.

They pour fecal reserves into that which doesn't comply with them, which might be memetically effective were they substantially better in their own bastions, which they simply are not.  That is one of the basic reasons why progress does not side with the primitive minds of those who prefer stone age ideologies over practices of mind consonant with modern societies and economies.

Fremulum bended the tip over to nearly 180° degree - yup, that's when the cumhole points back at you - while the phimosis would see to it, that the foreskin snapped back and got stuck behind the glans, resulting in blocked blood-flow. More was getting in, but hardly any would get down. Picture an over-ripe tomato on a stick. Basically I have anal fissures on my dick as a memento. The only remedy was to dip the whole affair cursing, hissing and screaming into a bucket of ice-cold water, wait for the swelling to subside and slowly pull my junk back into working order.

2179,"

&gt;Well let me play devils advocate since you seem like you want to argue. 

OK, I'm game.

&gt;There are actually some [medical pros](https://www.medicinenet.com/circumcision_the_medical_pros_and_cons/article.htm#what_is_the_relationship_between_circumcision_and_sexually_transmitted_diseases_stds) associated with circumcised infants. Risk of infant UTI’s decrease as less bacteria builds up in the foreskin. The risk of transmitting STD’s is increased with males with uncircumcised penis’ (quoted from the link).

So, doing a bit of reading, the counterpoint to this argument (and the one about cancer that ive seen) is simple: Practice good genital hygiene. Bacteria gather in plenty of areas if you don't clean them. We don't cut our kids' ears off if they don't wash behind them.

&gt;Also, getting circumcised later in life is a more complicated and involved. So How old should you be to consent to getting your foreskin cut off? Do you have to wait until you’re 18? If it’s earlier, does that child also have the right to consent that they want to do other cosmetic surgeries? What’s the difference between cutting off my foreskin and me getting plastic surgery? Is there a difference? 

If the argument is that the procedure should only be carried out with the recipient's consent, then that consent can't be given until they are of legal age to do so. If that's 18 normally, then yes. Same for plastic surgery. Heck, you can't even get your ears pierced in the UK until you're 16.

If the complications when you're older outweigh the potential reduction in risk of STDs and/or cancer in the future, that tells me the procedure isn't actually that beneficial at all.

&gt;If a parent feels like circumcised men have better long-term medical benefits, which have been documented such that penile cancer has only been reported in males who have been uncircumcised (per the link I posted above). Should the government have say in a procedure that has tangible medical benefits? 

&gt;If there was more widely agreed on evidence that specifically states all circumcision is bad (like of not vaccinating your child is universally known as bad) then I’d agree it should be illegal. It’s just too highly contested at the moment.

OK so I'll address these together, and really my whole argument can be summarised like this anyway:

A medical procedure, ANY medical procedure, which is undertaken pre-emptively, should ONLY be carried out where the evidence is VERY STRONG that the consequences of not doing so would be directly linked to a serious medical problem in the future.

As an example: removing a cancerous mole before the cancer can spread anywhere else. Or vaccination, which can demonstrably not just prevent but ERADICATE entire diseases (looking at you, Smallpox).

If the matter is still contentious within the scientific community, or the perceived benefit is statistically very small, then the procedure should not be undertaken unless the patient consents, and/or the procedure is reversible or has no lasting consequences.

IF it could be proven beyond reasonable doubt that infant circumcision in isolation led to a statistically significant reduction in the rates of cancer/HIV/etc among the general population, then I'd be all for it. But UNLESS AND UNTIL that point is reached, such a procedure should not be undertaken without the patient's informed consent.

My understanding is that the medical community has not formed a strong consensus on the relative merits of circumcision from a medical standpoint, and thus the scientific status quo (i.e. that the benefits, if any, are negligible) should stand. On those grounds, circumcision remains a cosmetic and/or symbolic procedure only and should not be performed on non-consenting children.

For the record, my original comment was about the religious defence of circumcision, not any medical ones, so I found this interesting to read up on.",,/r/europe/comments/e77mzn/breaking_finland_plans_to_protect_children_from/f9zjfv1/,UnloadTheBacon,1575742412

2183,"&gt;What a weird way to put it. It seems like I was correct in my previous comment about you since you had to fall so low as to compare me with the religious instead of adressing what I said.

You said I don't care about children's rights because I won't steal kids from their parents and would rather change the culture than force a ban. To me, talking in black and white is religious, in this thread you even **made up** that Sweden will ban circumcision this January.  Who do you remind yourself of when you make up facts?  


&gt;You do not care about the children. You see children as playthings of the parents whom in your view should be able to violate the child's basic human rights without society doing anything about it. 

One of the child's rights is being with their parents though. This makes things more complicated than you act. It requires good causes to remove them, and I do not believe circumcision is good enough (a parent still loves their child after  circumcision, in fact it is the faulty religious ideas they are brought up in that cause them to  circumcise ""out of love"", they want their kids to fit in with their heritage + not go to hell), I still think it would be better to not do it, but it's not enough to give the child to the state.  


&gt;I am not suggesting my solution is perfect, but the child is its own person, not an extension of the parents and if they can't respect that society has to step in to protect the child.

Agreed, obviously society must be able to step in and save kids, but circumcision is so normalised that the action you suggested would not respond properly to the crime committed. Also i believe this would lead to more kids dying, even now when hospitals in our country do not offer circumcision kids get hurt because of their dumbass parents. Let's not make it worse.

2195,"&gt;I never claimed there was any before 1870. In fact, I specifically said the Slavic Macedonian population didn't have a developed national identity until second half of 19th century. I'd advise you read my comments instead of being contrarian for the sake of arguing.

&gt;You never asked a question. But since you're fond of maintaining Bulgarian identity was live, well and extensive prior to 1870 I'd like you to prove it. 

There was the already mentioned self-identification, the active struggle for an independent Bulgarian church, the effort by locals to promote Bulgarian culture and education. What there is no evidence of is Bulgarian identity being something artificially introduced from abroad in Macedonia.

You started with claiming that the Bulgarian national identity in Macedonia was caused by Bulgarian propaganda, which makes little sense considering how late the Bulgarian Exarchate appeared.

&gt;Yes, shaking in their boots. You were split in two and under their nominal rule whereas the alternative (Serbs) were now fully independent after Berlin Congress.

The Ottomans were not stupid and they could see who's aspirations were more dangerous at this point - the ones who were a plurality in Macedonia and who now had the ideal of San Stefano Bulgaria to inspire them. Also, the Ottomans quickly lost control over Eastern Rumelia and never had any real control over the principality. Not to mention that Bulgaria was larger than Serbia even without Eastern Rumelia, never mind with it included.

As for the Serbian threat, considering how the previous war with Serbia went, I doubt they would have been considered much of a threat. Add the Serbian performance in the 1885 war and it would make little sense to consider them a more significant threat than Bulgaria.

More importantly, Serbia shared with the Ottomans the objections to an autonomous Macedonia, which was the aim of Bulgaria and the Bulgarian revolutionaries in Macedonia. So they had a tacit reason for cooperation.

&gt;Then you're either misinformed or purposefully ignorant. We're talking about 19th century for a reason. Nation states didn't exist prior to 19th century. Petko Slaveykov, your prominent poet writes about emergence of the idea of Macedonian national uniqueness in the 1860s and 1870s. Prior to that they didn't have a national identity at all. Some called themselves Bulgarians, some Serbs and some simply Christian but not in the sense of national identity but religious belonging. If you're a Slavic christian you're one of those three groups, otherwise you're a Turk, same way Orthodox Christians were often called by the blanket term Greeks under the Ottoman Empire regardless of their ethnic background.

The Petko Slaveykov article does not contradict my statement about the Macedonian name appearing in the second half of the 19th century. Of course it's importance is exaggerated by Macedonist sources. Consider that it appeared in the ""Makedonia"" newspaper, with many of their writers of course from Macedonia and that the article was soon denounced by Bulgarians from Macedonia. Also most of the arguments of the Macedonists in the article was about how they were not treated fairly, not so much about being a separate ethnicity.

&gt;Name some prior to the aforementioned grant by the Ottomans in 1897.

[They had eight just in the district of Skopie in 1891](https://books.google.bg/books?id=nyb5DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA124&amp;dq=Serbian+schools+Macedonia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwishcX7k6TmAhXSmFwKHbJ1D-0Q6AEISDAE#v=onepage&amp;q=%22there%20were%20eight%20Serbian%20schools%20in%20the%20district%22&amp;f=false). The reason the Serbs never had much success is not because of a ban, but due to the fact that few considered themselves Serbs.

&gt;Funny. Much of the later Serbian chetniks were formed of former VMRO members. Some I've mentioned already.

I guess you can always find traitors, especially if you're willing to pay for them. Though I imagine that the demoralization after the Ilinden uprising certainly helped recruitment as well.

&gt;Lol. This in the same post where you mention Treaty of San Stefano.

Lol back at you. This was under Alexander II, while under his son relations with Bulgarians worsened to the extent that relations were broken off in 1886. After that Russia's preferred ally in the Balkans was Serbia, not Bulgaria.

&gt;Well yes, they were formed there under the patronage of the King to defend national interests in Macedonia and Kosovo in 1903. But do you know why? Because VMRO that was until a few years prior fighting solely against the Ottomans in attempts to gain autonomy and whose members were both Bulgarian AND Serb came under the influence of a Bulgarian committee of high ranking military officers and king Ferdinand whose purpose was to dislodge Serbia's influence by confronting the Serbs there directly. So they began focusing on Serbs rather than Turks forcing many of its members to flee to Serbia and found the Chetnik movement there. If you take a look at Jovan Babunski, Pavle Mladenović, Micko Krstić, Temeljko Barjaktarević, Vangel Dimitrijević Skopljanče, Jovan Dovezenski, Đorđe Cvetković and many others you will see they are all from Macedonia who joined the Serbian chetnik movement looking for vengeance against the now predominantly Bulgarian VMRO who after Ilinden uprising started massacring Serb villages in Macedonia.

First of all, the committee of high ranking officers (incidentally entirely from Macedonia) had lost influence by 1903 in favor of the internal organization. Second, the last thing that IMRO would plan in 1903 would be in conflict with Serbia - they were rather busy with [other matters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilinden%E2%80%93Preobrazhenie_Uprising). But in a way the events of 1903 did lead to the conflict with the Serb (and Greek) bands. Serbia was alarmed by the Bulgarian influence in Macedonia (Serbia went so far as to threaten war with Bulgaria if they intervened in the uprising) and decided to use the opportunity to destroy this influence while the IMRO was weakened by the failure by the uprising. It didn't hurt that the Ottomans would be inclined to turn a blind eye to Serbian and Greek bands if their main aim was to attack the Bulgarians.

&gt;I gave you a German's quote that disputes this in literally the post you replied to.

The ruling was based off the fact that Italy has human rights violation concerns due to an extremely exhausted system, much like Greece; this thus does not apply to those who literally already were granted asylum elsewhere or who downright refused to apply for it in the first place and have no evidence of mistreatment in Italy or Greece.

I am all for the court's ruling on this case since indeed if someone comes and has evidence that their human rights are not properly being respected due to Greece and Italy not being able to keep up with the vast sheer numbers, then it'd fall even under the DP and not even require a suspension; Germany went too far by taking this court case at face-value and thinking that people who literally came via Spain and France are surely fine as well.

It is odd to me that Germany wants a quota system when it was already proven in Portugal, Lithuania, Slovenia, etc... all countries that accepted the first quotas and received some relocated refugees, that these refugees don't care to stay in poorer states and instead will go back to richer ones like Germany or Sweden even if illegally.

So again, the quotas are a broken system designed to spread errors that Germany did itself; and I believe that instead we should be helping Italy and Greece, and I also believe that we should not violate pan-European law on the matter more than we already have (especially by not granting the EU the power to decide quotas of migrants we all must take).",LusoFrench citizen living in the Netherlands,/r/europe/comments/e76vkk/hungarian_government_rejects_renewed_german/f9yunga/,RafaRealness,1575734163

I do not believe that these quotas, in their current form, are any good; I do not believe that the EU should have the power to dictate to Member States how much refugees they must take in, especially I do not believe that these quotas should mainly serve Germany instead of Greece and Italy.

I believe that Germany should go back to following DP, and I believe that IF there are gonna be any relocations, they will be agreements between Member States, without the EU getting involved and without infringing the TEU and the TFEU.

Is it clear now? I do not want to have to deal with Germany taking in too many refugees because of its own decisions, nor do I want the EU to hold the power to tell us how much we need to take in; instead I want us to offer help to Italy and Greece while still maintaining our sovereignty in migration affairs.

So I am not saying deport everyone back to Greece or Italy, I am saying deport those who already were rejected to get the hell out of the EU to begin with, and reject illegal migrants that did not make any arrangements with, say, France or Austria or even Hungary itself, because they were still ultimately targetting Germany first and foremost.

Except the West isn't just tolerating him, it is actively supporting Djukanovic's authoritarian regime.

In addition, it also became a NATO member even though people who know Montenegro's leadership are fully aware that Djukanovic has been the sole ruler of the country since the early 90s.

And yes, you don’t know if an infant will want to be an observant Jew, but if you’re an observant family then they’re likely to be observant too. It’s a question of whether you’ll do a procedure now that will likely save them a lot of pain later and have little to no health effects if they don’t want to be observant, or whether you’ll wait for their decision and potentially force them in a position to risk fucking their sexual health as an adult.",,/r/europe/comments/e77mzn/breaking_finland_plans_to_protect_children_from/f9yf7sg/,SecretlyFBI,1575727833

How it happens in practice is that after each edition of MEUS, a new Directorate is chosen and then they have a call for organizers. People apply (usually more than are needed) and the Directorate selects those they deem fittest for the role. Because we have five work divisions and more than 20 different positions that need to be filled (some of them multiple times), there's truly something for anyone. We've got Social Media Managers, a Treasurer, Partnerships Managers, Role Coordinators, a Local Support Team (=people in Strasbourg) - I could go on. Having a bit of experience always helps in being selected for one of the leading roles on the Team, but the great thing about being an organizer is that you learn things and gain experience you would otherwise NEVER have gotten to at this age. We are all students and young professionals and the level of responsibility and creative freedom we have with this project and something that you usually have to work your way up a company or institution for.

The character first appeared in an 1850 book by Amsterdam schoolteacher Jan Schenkman. Traditionally, Zwarte Piet is black because he is a Moor from Spain.[1] Those portraying Zwarte Piet usually put on blackface make-up and colourful Renaissance attire in addition to curly wigs and bright red lipstick

Pls tell how dressing as s character who became popular around 1850 after his appearence in the book for primary school Sint Nikolaas en zijn Knecht ""Saint Nicholas and his Servant"" is racist they are not hating on them,they are discriminaying them they are literally just cosplaying a character",Romania,/r/europe/comments/e7coni/its_again_that_time_of_the_year_in_the/f9xxfyu/,TheGodTachanka,1575719926

2494,"It's true, many applicants say that CV building is one reason why they apply. We know from feedback surveys that many of our alumni now work in the public sector (check my response to MarktpLatz above for more on that). Our participants are usually not ideologists - they come to Strasbourg to discuss with others! Plus, since they take on the role of someone else, they don't really get the opportunity to try and convert anyone to their ways. We also consciously allocate each person a role that we think they don't agree with personally (based on their application and CV). This forces them to put themselves in someone else's shoes and argue from that perspective for a change. That's a transformative experience for many people. And since we simulate the entire spectrum of elected officials, this goes for left and right, pro-EU and anti-EU, federalist and regionalist, everyone. So I think even if someone comes to Strasbourg an ideologist, they are very unlikely to leave as one. One example: Last year, we had someone who called himself ""EU-skeptic"" make a Facebook post after his week in Strasbourg, thanking everyone for the constructive discussions. He didn't change his mind per se, but he saw that it's possible - and valuable - to openly discuss different opinions even with people who you strongly disagree with. That's the magic of MEUS!

Yes! Lobbyism is a central part of MEUS - it's just that we call these participants ""Interest Representatives"" to avoid the negative image. They each get to represent one of a myriad of different interest groups: private companies, NGOs, unions, etc. Personally, I think it's one of the most exciting roles of them all! But I'm biased, because that's what I was at MEUS 2017.

1) Bigboys: With the US as the gang leader, it's the US, UK, France, and maybe we can include Germany in this group despite not having a strong military because of their political and economic power.  
2) Lieutenants: Countries like Spain, Netherlands, Italy, Belgium, who are good officers to follow the orders of the big boys and carry their orders to the 3rd group, provide armies, weapons and logistics but they do not have key roles as they aren't powerful enough.  
  
3) Bitches (workers): The smaller, often newer members with insignificant military presence and full dependence on US and US allies for weapons as well as protection by their military, such as Poland, Czech Republic, Baltic States, Romania, GREECE.Bulgaria, Romania, Montenegro, etc. These states are expected to be obedient servants and carry orders given to them by their superiors according to their geopolitical importance. They are expected to be obedient without asking questions (other then ""how high?"" when told to jump).   
   
Turkey is expected to be in this 3rd group: an obedient servant (""ally"")who won't ask questions and blindly follow orders, who won't even be sold air defense system because ""why do you need one? we'll protect you"". When the US sees a terror group as a ""threat"", the entire alliance and the world can be dragged all the way into Afghanistan mountains and deserts to invade a country unilaterally, kill civilians so that the US can restart opium production and control opium trade, the same privilege does not apply to Turkey for the alliance to recognize a militant group attacking Turkey for decades as a ""terror group"". They rather expect Turkey to accept the situation and recognize a neighbor country who's been a friendly trade partner of late a ""threat"".   
   
Why should Turkey accept it? What's ""threat to Turkey"" is a ""friend to NATO allies"" or big boys at least, ""in their fight against terror"". And what's a ""threat to these NATO countries"" (Russia) is not a threat to Turkey. It's very normal that Turkey shouldn't approve NATO's Baltic defense plan (because why should Turkey care about defending Baltic states when the alliance doesn't give a shit about Turkey's security, says it openly that a threat to Turkey is a friend to them.   
  
Maybe they should ask PYD to help Baltic defense against Russia, obviously they are a friend of choice for them.

2519,"You're wrong. 

Surgery may be needed if a child or adult has severe or persistent balanitis or balanoposthitis that causes their foreskin to be painfully tight.

Circumcision (surgically removing part or all of the foreskin) may be considered if other treatments have failed, but it carries risks such as bleeding and infection.

This means it's usually only recommended as a last resort, although it can sometimes be the best and only treatment option. 

Alternatively, surgery to release the adhesions (areas where the foreskin is stuck to the glans) may be possible. This will preserve the foreskin but may not always prevent the problem recurring.

Paraphimosis

Paraphimosis is where the foreskin can't be returned to its original position after being retracted.

It causes the glans to become painful and swollen and requires emergency medical treatment to avoid serious complications, such as increased pain, swelling and restricted blood flow to the penis.

It may be possible to reduce the pain and inflammation by applying a local anaesthetic gel to the penis and pressing on the glans while pushing the foreskin forward.

In difficult cases, it may be necessary to make a small slit in the foreskin to help relieve the pressure.

In severe cases of paraphimosis, circumcision may be recommended. In very severe cases, a lack of blood flow to the penis can cause tissue death (gangrene) and surgical removal of the penis may be necessary

2544,"I'm going to skip the earlier conversation.

&gt;The report recommends action on the issue

Yes, with the stated goal is to make child mutilation legal.

&gt;The goal here is to make it a decision in the adulthood. 

No. We went through this. The idea is to make it okay to mutilate ""consenting"" children. The language is explicitly about ""boys"".

&gt;You literally seem to want it to be acknowledged, that circumcision is an idiotic practice even at adulthood, for whatever reason. To which I agree! It's utterly moronic!

But if you supposedly oppose it why would you defend the goal of child mutilation?

&gt;And for reading comprehension they are not about how bad circumcision is, because as I said before, we agree on it!

You keep claiming this, but then you defend the goal of mutilating ""consenting"" children. You can only pick one. Stop defending goal of children consenting to mutilation and I'll believe you.

&gt;They are about how you're actually doing more damage than you're helping, how you're antagonizing the entire issue politically before it has even hit the political tables.

2620,"&gt; Nonmedical circumcision for reasons of tradition is currently allowed.

But it's only an interpretation of the law by the supreme court.

&gt;~~the changes would mean the operation would have to be volitional, based on the explicit wishes of the person on whom the operation is to be performed, and only when the person is mature enough to give informed consent.~~

Only a person who is for child mutilation would say that. A child cannot consent to being mutilated.

&gt;the goal of the proposals is to restrict nonmedical circumcisions

If the goal is to just simply do that, why does it talk about consenting children? Where do ""informed"" ""consenting"" children come into play when attempting to restrict nonmedical circumcisions? Please explain.

&gt;It'd take a very bizarre reading of the proposal to try and twist into something that promotes circumcisions, since it makes it more difficult to get it done, and places the right to decide to the correct party.

That's the whole problem with you and people like you, the whole incredibly naïve intepretation of issues.

The law already says that assaulting and causing bodily harm to people is wrong. Yet the supreme court interpreted that mutilating your own babies genitals is fine as long as you say it was for fairy-tale creatures. 

Nothing makes the supreme court interpret the law in the specific way that you think it will interpret it. Don't you understand? This is literally a goal that seeks to legalize child mutilation. It says right there on it. If it wasn't a goal to make child mutilation legal, it would say so, and not say the opposite.",Finland,/r/europe/comments/e77mzn/breaking_finland_plans_to_protect_children_from/f9x707i/,paskasubreddit,1575705842

2658,"&gt; Having nostalgia from a different time doesn't make you conservative either, are SPD voters who yearn for the years of Schmidt conservatives too?

If you still vote SPD because you liked Schmidt, you are indeed conservative.  

&gt;very much anti-patriotic (I mean that in a neutral way)

Still wrong though. They used to be, but right now, they're playing a whole lot with patriotism at the top levels of the party. 

&gt;Conservatism is about values, not a specific time period, although those things often correlate.

Assuming that would be true (it's not, that's a talking point back from the collapse of feudalism that wasn't true then and isn't true now,) the Greens would be way more conservative than the CDU since values are way more important to both their party and their voters. You aren't going to find a party base that's more about values than that of the Greens. 

&gt;Hard disagree, the FDP is certainly a right-leaning liberal party, but left-wing liberalism does exist in Germany, even inside the FDP.

Then you should be able to come up with examples, right? I don't know a single FDP politician that's to the left of center. 

&gt;In fact, some greens and most political analysts see the greens as a variant of left-wing liberalism.

No. Just no. ""Left-wing liberalism"" simply isn't part of the political vocabulary here, you should know this. ""Linker liberalismus"" is something you might hear hardcore leftists say instead of neoliberalism, but that's about it. 

&gt;The FDP is by all accounts a liberal party too, except you apply american definitions, which is wrong in a european context and in the very least in a german context.

You're just parroting what I already said here. 

&gt;Right-wing liberalism is NOT the same as conservatism

I didn't say it was. 

&gt;and FDP isn't even a fully right-wing liberal party anymore. 

How are they not the definition of a right-wing liberal party? It's *all* they are anymore! 

&gt;As far as I know, when it comes to definitions of words like liberal, Germany, aswell as the rest of the western world, except the US, use the same definition.

No, Germany doesn't use the same definition of liberal as the rest of the world or even the rest of Europe. 

&gt;Last point: Just because conservatives support liberal policies, these policies don't become conservative

Exactly: just because conservatives abandoned environmentalism to leftists in the 60's, doesn't stop making environmentalism one of the core foundations of conservative policy. And just because no one talks about that, doesn't make it any less true. Like, it's not an accident that a whole lot of conservatives have voted green for different elections even though they'd never give a second thought to the SPD.

 ""Goal: **Non-medical circumcision of __boys__ can be carried out** only **when the person [a boy] himself gives his consent**...


""Action 1: ...circumcision is delayed until the moment when the **boy** can fully participate...

&gt;The presentation is literally asking for a discussion, no?

A discussion when a child (a boy) can consent to being mutilated. How can this be so hard for you to understand?

&gt;And yes I obviously am the one not thinking when you're never formulating proper counterarguments.

You haven't made any arguments. All you've done is yeld at me to ""SHUT UP"" and ""go to hell"". You don't have any arguments about anything.

2778,"&gt;No matter what Serbs and Bulgarians say, it is true that the people of Macedonia were at large not nationaly inclined to either side until second half of the 19th century when Bulgarian exarchy and the Serbian metropolitate would cross paths in attempts to bring those people to their side. 

The Bulgarian Exarchy did not even exist until 1872. This was long after the population in Macedonia had been deeply involved in a struggle for the creation of this Exarchy and after there were Bulgarian schools in most of Macedonia. When the Exarchy was created, a plebiscite was held in large parts of Macedonia which was decided easily in favor of the exarchate. Every source of this period indicates that the majority of the population considered themselves Bulgarians. So no, this assertion simply won't fly.

&gt;And the Serbian church was for a long time banned by the Ottomans after gaining independence giving the Bulgarian church an edge on the matter. 

While again ignoring the inconvenient period before 1872, any advantage was lost after 1878 when the Bulgarian church was considered more dangerous by the Ottoman authorities. Not to mention that the Constantinople Patriarchy had no trouble cooperating with the Serbs against the Exarchy in northern Macedonia.

&gt;The Serbs had to counter it with guerilla tactics by sending chetnik regiments into Kosovo and Macedonia to enforce its own national interests.

On the other hand, the equivalent Bulgarian organizations were almost entirely composed of local Bulgarians. I would say this makes it difficult to support the assertion that there was some equivalence between the Bulgarian and Serbian influence in Macedonia.

&gt;My stance is that they were simply a Slavic people living in an Ottoman state whose history and identity was intertwined with all its neighboring countries over the centuries to the point they did't really have an identity.

You could say that for the rest of the Balkans as well. But that doesn't mean that the formation of the Bulgarian identity magically stopped at the edge of the Macedonian region (whose borders were not really established until after 1878 anyway).",Bulgaria,/r/europe/comments/e71tk5/ethnic_map_of_greater_romania_based_on_the_census/f9wza24/,GMantis,1575701706

&gt;But few people realise that early Enigma codes had already been broken by the Poles **who then passed on the knowledge to Britain shortly before the outbreak of war.**

They sent whole duplicate machine with their work like a month before war started, because they knew in case of war they wouldn't be able to do that anymore.

Again confirming what i stated. When Poland got into alliance AGAINST germany then Hitler changed tune and made his own alliance with Soviet union against Poland.

And here is **[more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_betrayal#Beginning_of_WWII,_1939)** about the lie:

&gt;Upon the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany in September 1939, Britain and France declared war on Germany. On 3 September a naval blockade of Germany was initiated, and an attempt was made to bomb German warships in harbour on 4 September. Most British bomber activity over Germany was the dropping of propaganda leaflets and reconnaissance. On 4 September, during a Franco-British meeting in France, it was decided that no major land or air operations against Germany would take place, and afterwards French military leader Maurice Gamelin issued orders prohibiting Polish military envoys Lieutenant Wojciech Fyda and General Stanisław Burhardt-Bukacki from contacting him.[24] In his post-war diaries, **General Edmund Ironside, the chief of the Imperial General Staff, commented on French promises: ""The French had lied to the Poles in saying they are going to attack.

2827,"&gt;What fucks the middle class is never ending taxation...

You are free to vote for lower taxes for the middle class or move to a country with lower taxes. But that isn't an excuse for letting international cooperations dodge taxes, legal or not. Every company should pay the intended corporate tax, just like local businesses. Every company should respect the environment.

&gt;Countries can be seen as businesses competing in the market to attract customers...

And what happens when countries compete without coordination? You give the advantage to the corporations. Instead countries need to band together to ensure equal tax rates and environmental regulations. We can still compete on having the best bureaucracy and infrastructure. But of course, that will take some real effort since it involves making actual improvements. 

&gt;If you offer good regulations/security for businesses it will attract lots of talent, investments, companies, jobs...

Sure, but I already said that. You just completely ignored my point about how lowering certain regulations is a loser's game. Lower your corporate taxes all you want, but once the other countries do the same, you lose business again. Then you can start lowering your standards on workers rights, environmental regulations and customers rights to privacy. I am sure Google would love that. 

Lowering tax rates in EU would be fine if it was done in all countries at the same time. But it should never be a competition, that's just nuts. Here in Denmark, we have 22% corporate tax and most are just fine with that. But we still hate tax-dodging companies and so should everyone else.

&gt;Honestly i can´t see how you can call living free to be required to pay under threat of violence &gt;50% of the fruits of your work...

The same way I could accept paying a 10% tax under threat of violence. The same way I accept being forced to uphold the laws. We accept the necessity of certain enforced rules because they are necessary and because we have a democratic government. People always say they hate taxes, but they still expect the police to protect them. Also, I don't actually call it ""living free"", I call it limited freedom. You can never be entirely free. Yet you seem to think that having a different tax rate (also enforced by violence), somehow magically makes you free.

&gt;As i said, this conduit, sink offshore financial centers and proper tax havens aren´t going to disappear

Rape and murder is not going to disappear either. But we still try to limit them. It's a BS argument.

&gt;IMO we should start asking for the same laws that apply to them, not the other way around because that´s not gonna happen.

That would be crazy, European countries should never emulate tax havens. You would lose business again, once the other countries did the same. Also, the government might have to enforce higher personal taxes or cut spending. I suggest moving to Panama instead, I am sure it's much better than Spain.",Denmark,/r/europe/comments/e70ren/netherlands_the_worlds_biggest_tax_haven/f9wjego/,GreenTeaHG,1575693592

2894,"If you're trying to compare trans people with circumcision, that is not a logical comparison.

First, trans kids have to go through some sort of psychological counseling to determine if they can get hormones.  Circumcision is done with no consent.

Second, if you want to get circumcised at a later age, you can do so relatively easily.  If you are trans and are not able to go on hormone replacement therapy, some things are irreversible (ex hip growth for female to male people or height for male to female people).

The methods to achieve the treaty goals are constantly being evaluated. There is no reason why there can be no discussion about that.

&gt;If NATO needs ""something else"", Germany certainly doesn't reserve the right to determine that by themselves.

Neither does the USA have the right to deny that discussion.

&gt;I agree entirely with what you said in the rest of it. We are a protectorate, but we are a willing partner in that arrangement. Our ""impera"" has made clear that we have not paid the promised taxation for their protection - how dare we sit here and shout ""INDIGNATION!"" at that request? We agreed to this. We are in this voluntarily. They do not own us.
&gt;We are responsible for our actions as people, as governments, states or even intranational entities.

2934,"&gt; What on earth could PiS have done to lose this much support

Most recent (although started before elections) problem is called Mariusz Banaś. PiS politician (from among ""old guard"" of Kaczyński, not some random outsider), who they elected into head of NIK (Supreme Audit Office). And who came to be heavily lying in his property declarations, who got an apartment house in Kraków very cheap (using methods which PiS accused PO previously in Warsaw), who covered a VAT stealing scandal (being a deputy finance minister responsible, and praised for end of such), and best one, in whose apartment house (mentioned above) there was a legal brothel, run by a regular criminal.

There are two explanations of this situation, both bad for PiS - either they knew, and put a very shady character into extremely important office... or they didn't, which means that state services don't work correctly. And as some clues to the whole scandal were known (thanks to media) before he was elected, and opposition actually warned against it - first explanation seems to be correct here.

Problem - this office enjoys immunity, and PiS can't dismiss him without 2/3 majority. And he doesn't want to step down himself (probably being afraid they'd make him a scapegoat). Worse, he openly went rogue, announcing special audits into government, e.g. checking property declarations of PM and ministers.

The Eastern dialects of Finnish are historically more closely related to Karelian, while the Western dialects are historically more closely related to Estonian, but having been part of the same administrative region and having a common standardised version have pushed the two into modern Finnish.

3167,"It's incredibly hard to understand. It's certainly a mix of several factors. What a lot of people don't understand it that the Nazis didn't simply start sending trains to Auschwitz when they took over. It was a step by step process that took many years. In 1940 many high ranking Nazis still believed in the ""Madagascar plan"" and Jewish emigration was encouraged/forced. It wasn't until the summer of 1941 when the holocaust began and even then they didn't immediatly start rounding up Jews. After the start of Barbarossa the Einsatzgruppen simply got the vague order to kill the ""intelligentsia"" and ""partisans"" in the occupied territories. It wasn't until weeks later (the date is controversial) when Jews became the primary targets. From then on it escalated rapidly though. It didn't take long until women and children became targets as well. In December they opened Chelmno to make the mass killings ""easier"", a few months later Birkenau, Sobibor, Treblinka and Belzec. 

Mentality-wise there was a lot of ""preemptive obedience"", cognitive dissonance, peer pressure, hate, toxic\^1 masculinity and ignorance. And the scary thing is that all of those traits still exist. 

&gt;but if you look/research at the history of the Jews in Europe, the holocaust isn't surprising; it was simply the logical conclusion to the old age 'Jewish question' 

I disagree with that. Nazi Germany was pretty much alone with its murderous antisemtism. They even had to convince their nationalist allies to hand them their jews, which Hungary for example refused until the end. I'm sure that if history would've went differently in Germany, something like a holocaust wouldn't have happened.

3203,"It's a complicated issue. When you legalize prostitution you normalize it. It becomes an accepted pastime. It becomes more popular. Therefore the number of prostitutes rises and human trafficking increases. The customers do not care about the well-being of their service providers, but instead buy where it is cheapest.

Now instead if you go the Swedish way and prohibit buying of sex, you send a message that this is not something the society approves. Prostitution does not disappear but it diminishes and goes underground. Total number of prostitutes goes down. Trafficking becomes rare.

For me the choice is clear. The societal changes that happen when young men learn that sex is a service like all others, are so great and so repulsive that I'd go the Swedish way any day.

This is not a question whether an individual who wants to sell sex has that right, but a question of how our society changes when sex becomes commodity.",,/r/europe/comments/e73d3i/legal_status_of_prostitution_in_various_european/f9v2wsb/,JohnPaston,1575662186

3253,"That's an interesting perspective. I live in a country with pretty powerful unions (Norway), and it's not uncommon to see strikes in the public sector. That being said, when there's a great risk of harm, there's also a good chance of forced arbitration. I'm sure the unions take that into account, though. Also, the unions have a lot of clout with the social democratic parties, which is another way they can wield power. A big union with a democratic structure carries a lot of legitimacy, and can carry a lot of competency as well – which often makes politicians listen, at least if they know the union's members might vote for them.

Hey, if you can't be unreasonably radical on Reddit, then I don't know where you'd do it. I'm not a revolutionary, though – in fact, I think that once you have some kind of democracy going, revolutions aren't a democratic way forward. You have to move carefully, consolidating and building consensus along the way, otherwise it's just one part of the population overruling another. This is not necessarily the fastest way of achieving change, but probably the fastest way of achieving change that's legitimate and politically sustainable.

While there's a lot of trust involved in money, I don't think you can reduce money to trust, but I do think it is an important form of power – and your argument works just as well if you replace ""trust"" with ""power"".

Finnish does have a large amount of vocabulary borrowed from Germanic languages, and a fair bit from Slavic languages too, but they're rarely clear enough to be immediately obvious.

But Finnish capitalists were so scared they lost their plants, factories and other means of productions that they asked help from Germany and after they defeated finnish communists they created fascist society with concentration camps, terror and mass murdering. The roots of Finnish svastika  came right from these events.

3284,"&gt;  They’ll probably go home by themselves later

That's what they did.

&gt; One immediate result of the economic down-turn was a hardening of attitudes towards 'foreign workers of all sorts. If published unemployment rates in West Germany (close to zero in 1970) did not climb above 8 percent of the labor force despite
a slump in demand for manufactured goods, it was because most of the unemployed workers in Germany were not German—and thus not officially recorded. When Audi and BMW, for example, laid off large numbers of their workforce in 1974 and 1975, it was the 'guest workers' who went first; four out of five BMW employees who lost their jobs were not German citizens. In 1975 the Federal
Republic permanently closed its recruiting offices in North Africa, Portugal, Spain and Yugoslavia. As the 1977 Report of a Federal Commission expressed the point in its 'Basic Principle #1': *'Germany is not an immigrant country. Germany is a place
of residence for foreigners who will eventually return home voluntarily.'* Six years later the Federal Parliament would pass an Act to 'Promote the Preparedness of Foreign Workers to Return'.

&gt; Voluntarily or otherwise, many of them did indeed return 'home'. In 1975, 290,000 immigrant workers and their families left West Germany for Turkey, Yugoslavia, Greece and Italy. In that same year, 200,000 Spaniards returned to Spain in search of work; returnees to Italy now outnumbered emigrants for the first time
in modern memory, as they were shortly to do in Greece and Portugal. By the midseventies, nearly a third of a million Yugoslav emigrants had been obliged to return to the Balkans, where their expectation of employment was no better than in Germany
or France. The northern European jobs crisis was being re-exported to the Mediterranean. Meanwhile France imposed strict restrictions on immigration from Algeria and its former African colonies, and the/United Kingdom placed ever tighter limits on would-be immigrants from the South Asian sub-continent.

The communist party under Tito tried to do the same with Albanians by calling the ones in Albania as such while the ones in Yugoslavia were called by their autonym - Shqiptar.

40 years later Serbia rid itself of communism but one of its relics was a vocal Vlach minority that refuses to call itself Romanian, although the trend is currently going in the positive direction.

For the record, no one is forbidding Vlachs to declare as Romanians, there are currently more people in Serbia declaring as Romanian than Vlach. The problem is that 4 decades of indoctrination was enough to make the problem persist. I'm a Serb from Bosnia so I might be biased, but I don't think Serbs specifically are to blame.

Nope, it's a diplomatic response you give to an overly pushy car salesman when you just want to move on. You tell them 'I have to think about it'. 

Read the wording of that particular agreement. It's not 'we will spend 2% of GDP by 2024' it's 'we'll spend 2% of GDP, if we can afford it and it's politically feasible'. The lobbyists have switched their approach and now try to use this non-binding agreement as a propaganda tool to push NATO members into spending more money for their products.

And again, it's not a security necessity or the spending goal would've been tied to specific procurements or some other metric of combat power. 

Germany could start to build their own nuclear arsenal and reach the 2% instantly, but 200+ extra nuclear missiles wouldn't increase the deterrence of an attack against NATO members one bit. 

They could do some accounting sleight of hand and put military pensions under the defence budget or make parts of the police and emergency services an arm of the military, but again, this wouldn't increase the effectiveness of NATO.",,/r/europe/comments/e6ophb/he_german_parliament_has_passed_a_record_budget/f9uqdml/,solar_prominence,1575655807

3437,"&gt; A senior British diplomat in the US has quit with a blast at the UK government over Brexit, saying she could no longer ""peddle half-truths"" on behalf of political leaders she did not ""trust.""
&gt;
&gt; In a searing resignation letter delivered just over a week before the UK general election, Alexandra Hall Hall, the lead envoy for Brexit in the British Embassy in Washington, said that she had become increasingly dismayed by the demands placed on the British civil service to deliver messages on Brexit which were not ""fully honest.""

&gt; ""I have been increasingly dismayed by the way in which our political leaders have tried to deliver Brexit, with reluctance to address honestly, even with our own citizens, the challenges and trade-offs which Brexit involves; the use of misleading or disingenuous arguments about the implications of the various options before us; and some behaviour towards our institutions, which, were it happening in another country, we would almost certainly as diplomats have received instructions to register our concern,"" she wrote in her letter, dated December 3.
&gt;
&gt; ""It makes our job to promote democracy and the rule of law that much harder, if we are not seen to be upholding these core values at home.""
&gt;
&gt; Hall Hall said she could no longer reconcile her commitment to the job with the demands made of her. ""I am also at a stage in life where I would prefer to do something more rewarding with my time, than peddle half-truths on behalf of a government I do not trust,"" she wrote in the letter.",,/r/europe/comments/e70myw/senior_british_diplomat_in_us_quits_with_tirade/f9ucfaq/,concerned_future,1575648258

Basically, as it's been said a hundred times in this subreddit, Catalan separatists don't even have the required majority in their own regional Parliament to START talks for constitutional change.

As a result, and ignoring the most basic democratic rules, they passed irregular laws against the ruling of their own legal consultation team.

I wonder why the road blocks and street rioting has stopped, and why Catalan policemen are acting against rioters now under orders from the pro-separatist government.

Perhaps because nationalists are in talks with Sánchez in order to arrange a government. Rioting is not convenient now.

3453,"that is true, but no one is talking about going 100% nuclear, smart people want combination of nuclear and renewables, this would extend for how long reverses last, this should make us last long enough to progress nuclear reactor tech to next generation easily, this will in turn make nuclear waste viable as fuel, which will help with problem of nuclear waste and give us even more time.

At this point fusion reactors should be well developed that we can switch to them OR we can toward Nuclear fusion–fission hybrid reactor.
The basic idea is to use high-energy fast neutrons from a fusion reactor to trigger fission in otherwise nonfissile fuels like U-238 or Th-232. Each neutron can trigger several fission events, multiplying the energy released by each fusion reaction hundreds of times. This would not only make fusion designs more economical in power terms, but also be able to burn fuels that were not suitable for use in conventional fission plants, even their nuclear waste.

U-238 is the most common isotope of uranium found in nature, with a relative abundance of 99.2745%, yes what we currently use as nuclear fuel isnt even 1%, so if we could use U-238  lack of fuel wouldnt be a problem for a VERY long time(here is around 40 trillion tons of uranium in Earth's crust and 99.2745% of it is U-238)",,/r/europe/comments/e6yby3/do_no_harm_nuclear_squeezed_out_of_eu_green/f9ucxxr/,Culaio,1575648516

3526,"Democratize? If you ask me the reality of this is scarier than it seems. What's happening in Turkey isn't really like anything we've seen before. Sure, you can compare Erdoğan to Stalin or Hitler or whatnot, but he's his own breed. When it comes to Western media I see people like to just label him as an Islamist and blame the whole thing on religion but that's not even remotely the truth.


Dude just happened to tap into a formula that just worked, it actually worked wonderfully for him. He didn't come into power through no coup, no junta, no appointment. He was _democratically elected_, at least at first.


He's not far right, he's not far left either. On paper he's quite moderate actually. He has always appealed to an apolotical crowd, did a full 180° on his stances countless times. If you were to talk to a voter of him they wouldn't call themselves right wing or left wing. He weaponized mass media, found a way to use the 51% as a shield.


You'd expect tyranny to be overcome by the masses, but how are you supposed to fight tyranny of the masses? The hard truth is that most people, _including European ones_, are quite content being ignorant. An Erdoğan voter couldn't care less about his stances or where he stands or what happens to the economy, _they just like the guy_.


We've been seeing the same shit pop up all over the place nowadays. Netanyahu, Orban, Duda, arguably even Johnson and Trump are some examples. One could also argue that it's been happening within the EU with left-wing populists instead of right wing ones, but maybe that would be getting ahead of ourselves. Basically the formula works, and it will happen more, and it will happen again, and I have no idea how it could be fixed.


Within the pocket of prosperity between WWII and today, European masses had the privilege to underestimate just how vulnerable they are to tyranny. The value of individuality in the eyes of an average citizen has been gradually sinking to a dangerous low and unless people start giving a shit real soon some of 'em will see themselves at the end of a shooting range.

3630,"Actually, there is. 

Quite a few papers were published by a commission named 'Conseil d'Orientation des retraites', there was a report by JP Delevoye on the subject, etc... 

Basically, there's a rough time between 2025 and 2070 at most, where the current system will be in deficit by about 10 billions € a year. Depending on the global state of the economy, it can be a bit less or a bit more (a lot of hypotheses have been discussed in the reports). 

So the opposition to the current reform is basically saying ""add a bit of money for a few years or add something like 6 months to work for everyone and we're done, no need to overhaul the whole thing"". 

The current project is still extremely hazy, but the gist of it is to replace a system where your retirement pensions are calculated on a % of the 25 best years (or the last 6 months for the public workers) to a system where you gain points for each euro you put in the system and when you retire you get a pension equal to your points x value of the points.

Please don't talk to me like you're a politician. You agreed to do something and didn't do it; i.e. you broke your word and are utterly unreliable. It is high time you stopped pretending that the fault is with the party holding you up to your own commitments, and instead admitted that it is *you* who fails to live up to their agreements, and that it is *you* who will not give their ""allies and friends"" what they promise. And then stop talking until you do; or stop pretending you are a friend or ally of the U.S. in any meaningful way.

&gt;NATO spending is not a tribute for the US, nor is the vast majority of the US military spending motivated by their NATO membership, but their own hegemonic interests.

In absolutely no way related to the fact that Germany and other European countries are untrustworthy allies who feel so morally superior to their ""friends and allies"" that they won't even stomach the idea of being held to the agreements they made with them without being outraged.

Let us admit the truth: Germany is no friend or ally to anyone except Germany.

3726,"&gt;While avoiding the physical violence or the jailing of journalists common in autocratic regimes elsewhere, the Hungarian government has pursued a clear strategy to silence the critical press through deliberate manipulation of the media market – engineering the forcible closure or effective government takeover of once-independent media – and through the delegitimization of journalists. The construction of a pro-government media empire serves as a vast propaganda machine for the government of Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, insulating large parts of the public from access to critical news and information so as to maintain the Fidesz party’s hold on power

So government didn't do anything other than create their own private media who out-competed old media.

You have only 3 weeks holidays because you have no great worker protection (something Germany and France citizens did fight a lot for).

When a party finally brings a health care system on the way, the next party destroys it again and the people even applaud?

You don't pay as many taxes as we do (more then 50% of what my boss has to pay for me is payed for taxes in the end, especially if I also count in taxes on fuel and food), so people that earn a lot don't have to give something back... And especially the super rich are happy about that.

And exactly those super rich people live the american dream while the rest of you is working for them... Maybe you should look at that problem before putting Europe as the reason why shit is going down in your country.

The only reason the US is not a welfare state is itself and not Europe. Most of your military budget doesn't even go Europe.

&gt;AJ: So why don’t the foreign policy experts ‘get’ it?

&gt;MD: I think that there actually is a Washington bubble. When I used to hear Republicans and Democrats talk about the Washington bubble, I never took the expression seriously. But now I believe it exists. People who hold these positions work at Washington-based think tanks and they never have to travel to Iowa and Wisconsin and sell these positions. Their jobs are safe regardless of whether they can sell their positions to the electorate or not.

&gt;Another reason is that the think tank world is dominated by progressive ideas, and this true on the left and right. There is left-wing progressivism and right-wing progressivism. Left-wing progressivism wants the US to use its military and economic power to strengthen multilateral institutions while right-wing progressivism is more comfortable with unilateral military action but still bound by an ideological standpoint of attempting to transform the world, rather than simply defending the American national interest.

Icelandic, although evolving as every other live language is, gives readers the ability to read old Norse from hundreds of years ago. Imagine reading Beowulf in old English and actually understanding it right away! A better example of showing you how awesome this is would be to just listen to someone online speak Old English, or even Middle English. For more comparison, Shakespeare is Modern English, just like us.

Danish, Norwegian and Swedish are indeed mutually intelligible when spoken slowly but Danish reigns supreme in understanding all three. The study behind this is referred to as ""Asymmetric Intelligibility."" This means that Danes understand Norwegians and Swedes but Norwegians and Swedes have a tougher time understanding Danes. There's tons of reading on this and some YouTube videos; my favorite would be by Paul on LangFocus.

Finnish, as mentioned, comes from an entirely different language family known as ""Uralic."" Another example would be Estonian. And another language is actually Hungarian! Although central European, Hungary's language does not even remotely relate to the surrounding countries languages, as they are Indo-European and not Uralic.

You do not have to take my word for how badly France is exploiting Africa, Jacques Chirac has said so himself. Here are a couple of articles that you can research about this:

As for France being imperialist: https://www.dictionary.com/browse/imperialism

That is exactly what they are doing.

France being imperialist and holding their boot down on them and then justifying their actions with the white mans burden trope I think is racist in nature.

Nobody thinks China is there as saviors. China is only there for the money, they are seemingly using unethical trade practices to gain assets in poor countries. They don't seem to provide aid unless it's a bribe and they provide loans that trap poor countries when they can't pay them back, in short. 

But let me tell you what China hasn't done. They haven't militarily invaded vast areas of Africa, cut regions into countries to best exploit their resource with no care for the nationalities. They didn't create a whole monetary system where the Chinese central bank control the monetary policy and keeps puppet regimes ensuring cash flows back to the motherland.

Sure China is getting in on the action, but it is still very far from what China has been doing so far. This kind of competition between powers can often be very lucrative for developing countries as they will compete for aid and influence. The thing is, France can't compete in the long run.

&gt; 
&gt; Unemployment at 10% for the frence. 

Yeah, as opposed to the US hiring temps, contractors, and part time people to avoid benefits

Rioting is a fucking *good* thing when done for the right causes. Your side of the ocean is screwed because everybody over there is so damn apathetic.

That's how you've ended up with the most idiotic leaders - all the Anglo nations ... I dunno wtf is wrong with you, but you all suffer from electing horrendous leadership and being utterly apathetic about everything.

French, German, Belgian, Danish ... when they feel their rights are trampled on, or their representatives aren't representing them correct, well then they protest.

US? Canada? You just sit idly by as these people completely fuck you over, fuck the environment over ... and generally just enrich themselves while not doing their actual job: representing their constituents.

&gt;We also don't have someone like UK trying to leave. It really doesn't seem like all sunshine and rainbows. There is also a serious issue with negative interest rates. 

No, because you don't even allow them to. The ""land of the free"" where states aren't allowed to leave if their population so desires.

&gt;No it's not. We have been over this already. EU has been increasing for 5 years. More Solar and wind won't help. This is also hiding things like burning trees like it's the 1800s. Since they are trees they aren't counted as CO2. This is barbaric.

No ... it's expected to decrease 4% in 2019. It's risen just like the US has risen - we've been over this as well.

The total **embedded** CO2 output/capita has dropped far more in the EU than in any other region on earth - fact.

You can complain and whine and think you are right ... but you're not. Facts are facts. The US is dropping because it's switching to natural gas, not because it's switching to a clean energy source.

As for the trees thing, biomass *is* renewable you oaf ... as long as you plant trees to make up for the ones you burn. You can't plant natural gas again, or shale oil.

&gt;Not complaining. I'm stating the trends, and I expect Europe will learn it's mistakes soon.

Providing the highest quality of life for citizens on planet earth - what a horrible mistake

&gt;Easier to take 100 million people out of poverty that already have power sources like Nuclear then to create new power for 75 million people. Again it was widely debated about role at CO2 because there was a massive global cooling scare in the 1970s. 

Mate, if you believe that shit then you're a gullible idiot and are out of reach.

There was never a scientifically backed cooling scare. It was all BS. It was widely known throughout the 60s and 70s what GHG was going to do to us - Jimmy Carter pushed the idea that you morons over there had to act ... but you all chose to go in a neo-conservative ""fuck myself as hard as I can"" direction.

&gt;This is a lie. It's falling. We've been over this data over and over again.

No, the US had an [increase in 2018](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-46801108). And not even a small increase, fucking monumentally large.

&gt;The only thing the government is fighting is hidden socialism in the bills. Gender equality related topics. Like I said there is a new nuclear power bills. 

There is no socialism in the Paris accord you dimwit. 

&gt;Coal is falling fast. Many green energy subsidies. 

Stop sounding like Donald Trump, it doesn't suit anybody acting like an utter moron

&gt;Yes the world is warming at a rate of .14C per decade since 1970s. However nearly every single alarmism has not happened. 

Again, simply not true. Since the 1960s we've known that at the rate we've been outputting GHG that it wasn't until the 2020s/30s that we'd start seeing really negative aspects.

Nature is fucking resilient, but not *that* resilient.

4112,"a few more common uses of pula off the top of my head: 

""A face pula mare"" literally ""to make a big penis"", means to make a fuss or to throw a fit at someone higher up the food chain than you. 

when something is in the way, it's sitting like a penis in the middle of the road *sta ca pula in mijlocul drumului""

""Can't have your cake and eat it too"" is in romanian ""nu poti si cu pula-n cur si cu sufletu-n rai"", literally meaning ""taking cock up the ass and your soul going to heaven"" 

If you're interested in more pula,there is a classic romanian very short story called ""The story of the pula"" or ""the story of stories"" written by I. Creanga, our most beloved children's adventure stories author . It's got jesus and saint peter, irreverent peasants and horny noblemen's wives, a field of pula as big as the eye can see, and a butt fucked priest to boot. 

while pula is by far the most used word in the romanian language, officially, nobody EVER uses the word, EVER. Kids get beaten by their parents if they are heard saying it and the entire mass media pretends that the word does not exist. If it's used twice in a modern romanian movie, there's national uproar against ""the filth in art these days"".

If you think *only a sith deals with absolutes* or there of course must in hundreds of years in history be some cases.

4190,"&gt;At the end of the day, there is not a single shred of positive evidence for it: no cluster of Romanian toponyms anywhere outside Romania, not a single chronicle mentioning a migration of vlachs, no folk memory of it among romanians or any of their neighbours, nothing.

We lack the same kind of evidence for Romanians living around modern Romania for centuries too, if anything the fact that most Vlachs were recorded to be first south of the Danube and how loanwords came into being in Romanian shows that the nativist theory is more flawed.

&gt;In fact, what evidence we have of Balkan vlachs suggest they were few, disorganized and scattered. They're mentioned in Byzantine chronicles, yes, but extremely rarely and always as nothing more than small groups of transhumant shepherds. Hardly a solid population base for colonizing a large and heavily-contested territory...

Because it wasn't colonized all at once and it wasn't heavily populated either, using your own logic how did Romanian survive over such a large and contested territory? You are pushnig arguments that criticize both theories, not just the one you don't like.

&gt;and the similarities with Albanian can be explained in a number of ways.

So can the lack of evidence of massive migrations or lack of ""clusters"" of Romanian toponyms.

&amp;#x200B;

During today's press conference, President Andrzej Duda objected to calling Russia an enemy of Poland. 

 \- One thing I want to emphasize very strongly here, because I do not  want us to fall into rhetoric here, which is completely unauthorized -  there is no enemy - emphasized the President of Poland. 

 Andrzej Duda pointed out that the only enemy you can possibly talk  about is terrorist organizations, but it is completely unauthorized to  designate any country as an ""enemy"". 

\- There is no enemy today.  No one is attacking the North Atlantic Alliance today.   Perhaps the enemy can be called state-owned entities, i.e. various  types of terrorist organizations that allow themselves to be attacked  either by citizens of NATO countries or by soldiers of NATO countries.  Here you can really talk about an enemy.  But we absolutely cannot speak of any enemy at the inter-state level today.  There is no such situation today, which I want to emphasize with all my strength - said Andrzej Duda. 

 In the further part of his speech, the president pointed out that  Russia is Poland's neighbor and both countries disagree on many issues,  some of Moscow's actions are unacceptable to NATO, but one cannot say  that Russia is an enemy of the Polish state.   Andrzej Duda emphasized that the order that was formed after 1989 was  created thanks to peaceful transformations and Poland does not agree to  undermine it.",,/r/europe/comments/e6q4zn/dudapis_russia_its_not_our_enemy/f9se0wc/,bm52oc,1575590579

At the end of the day, there is not a single shred of positive evidence for it: no cluster of Romanian toponyms anywhere outside Romania, not a single chronicle mentioning a migration of vlachs, no folk memory of it among romanians or any of their neighbours, nothing.

In fact, what evidence we have of Balkan vlachs suggest they were few, disorganized and scattered. They're mentioned in Byzantine chronicles, yes, but extremely rarely and always as nothing more than small groups of transhumant shepherds. Hardly a solid population base for colonizing a large and heavily-contested territory...

Aside from which, the toponymy argument is as much an argument against the immigrationist theory and the similarities with Albanian can be explained in a number of ways.

4355,"&gt; So I'm curious why they'd want 70+ pensions.

The answer is simple: pensions in France are mandatory expenses for the workforce: every worker and employer in France *has* to pay into the pot ; since workers get money once they retire, that's delayed salary. If you reduce the pensions, people and companies will have to put less into the pot.

With high unemployment, it's quite unlikely that workers will be able to negociate so that this delayed share of their salary is added to their salary. So in effect you're making work cheaper. That could be nice for the economy, if we hadn't tried supply-side economics for decades now without much to show for it.",France,/r/europe/comments/e6jxbl/france_crippled_by_biggest_strike_in_years/f9s035e/,blitzAnswer,1575583735
4356,"&gt; If the Euro gains a bigger reserve status, the demand for euros would go up, and thus the strength of the currency as well. I don't see Germany liking that too much.

Germany historically has fetishized currency strength and abhorred inflation. They are sensible enough to do what is necessary to maintain a favorable export balance, however, they are not always sensible enough to spend money if they have it.

&gt;Also, is the EU primarily an importing trade block like the US is an importing nation? That helps to push the use of dollars in overseas markets up. Everyone sells to the US and takes the dollars and uses them to buy other things.

A balanced balance of trade is the only sustainable trade policy in the long run, so we shoudn't strive for anything else. With sufficient trade, sufficient euroes will spread.

&gt;This article also mentions that Eu officials want deeper domestic capital markets to push the euro currency internationally . I don't see that happening soon since their domestic banks are in shambles. Many European companies are going to US banks for more capital since the european banks have little to loan.

That's really not the case, banks don't know what do to with their money. Interest is at an historcial low. In case of a money shortage, the opposite would be true.

It's true that internal fluidity of capital markets is insufficient, or maybe it's an issue of who bears the risk in case of bankrupcy. In any case the level of wealth concentration is a concern, so simply emulating the US is not possible. So internal capital markets, in particular for venture capital, will remain a point of attention for a while.",Limburg,/r/europe/comments/e6go15/europe_first_taking_on_the_dominance_of_the_us/f9s03m3/,silverionmox,1575583741

Well, what do you call it when the media refuses to use the same term for identical crimes done by non-Muslims? See [these examples.](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/c6lygj/sex_crimes_against_under16s_rocket_to_62000_a/esar84s/)

Says he under an article about the Telford grooming gang, discovered in 2010, with the crimes occurring between 2007 and 2009. 

The magic of news is that the subsequent events they trigger become news on their own right as well. The FA scandal broke in 2016 and the investigation only started then.

On the other hand, household consumption slowed (3.1 percent vs 3.3 percent) and net trade contributed negatively to growth, as exports advanced 10.2 percent (vs 9.4 percent) while imports jumped at a faster 11.4 percent (vs 11.0 percent).",Bulgaria,/r/europe/comments/e6mjpt/gdp_growth_in_europe_for_q3_2019/f9rg972/,maximhar,1575575900

I for one, do not agree with the general handling of our Eastern Mediterrenean policy, but i'm sure as hell not going to let you spread propaganda. 

Turkey does not agree that islands should have their own EEZs. That is why we claim what we claim today. Plus EEZs should be established by negotiating with neighboring nations. Greece never consulted us. So having disputes is only normal. 

&gt;it is really pathetic that your country accepted to expand the Black Sea with such policy and yet they claim that it doesn't apply in the aegean

We do not have islands in Black Sea and our EEZ there has ben agreed by all other states who have a coast to Black Sea. So no not the same way.

&gt;Well if your goverments would stop threatning Greece like they did for more than 20 years we would consider it

You deserve to be threatened because of your blatant aggression and violations in the Agean, remember you broke the treaty you signed yourself, there isn't even any justification for that.


&gt;let's not forget what you did to Cyprus,

Saved the Turkish minority from being slaughtered and stopped Greece (which was a military dictatorship at the time) from annexing it? Damn those evil Turks.

Self-determination, bitches.

Not sure about Catalunya, especially after the recent events, but I don't think Bavaria wants to break away from Germany. I KNOW Transilvania won't break away from Romania. California ... not sure, but most likely stays American.

When such a move is proposed, you just have to make sure that the part that wants to break away will lose a bunch of things. In the case of California, the protection of the US Army, nukes etc. They will lose ALL the benefits of being part of the federation. They might need visas to get into the US, there may be tariffs on their main exports, such as movies etc.

In the case of Catalunya, Bavaria or Transilvania, they'd lose EU membership for a start. 2 or the 3 would be landlocked and surrounded by the EU. They'd risk tariffs, border checks, massive loss of investment and EU grants and subsidies.

The money you make from investments gets taxed less in Germany as normal income tax. Taxes on food and consumer goods (especially on stuff like tabak or alcohol) affect your total amount of money you have a lot more as someone who has more money. By paying rents, you indirectly pay taxes that ""officially"" the rich guy pays that owns your home.

&gt; Shouting 'tax the rich' is nothing more than an easy, pointless copout that only serves to shift responsibility from everyone onto a convenient outgroup.

The poor people and the middle class is paying a lot higher % of their income for taxes as someone that doesn't have to work anymore and can live from his ""investments"". And what money do they actually ""earn""? They just invested into a company you work for. They indirectly pay you for it, but actually they make more money as what you get payed.

5023,"Well the PISA is a test used for measuring quality of education. You might argue that it is flawed in different ways, but Sweden did have quite a sharp drop in results after the first year of PISA (2000) and they kept declining for 12 years. I don't think PISA is so bad of a measurement that this is something that doesn't indicate at LEAST some fall of quality in education.

The fact that teachers have less leeway in what they can teach is unfortunate, but different students with different teachers should not have drastically different demands put on them and therefore it's highly regrettable but also understandable that changes to make students results easier to grade equally across the country.

I do see some negative sides of the reform but as a whole I still liked that. Anecdotal evidence isn't real evidence, but when I talk with my classmates in high school I still get the impression there quite a big difference in grade VS demand, ESPECIALLY in subjects where either 1. There was no national tests. (Art, Crafts, technics and especially modern languages where subjects where I perceived the grading had differed so much from school to school but also schools in my city vs schools outside) OR much less so but still somewhat in subjects where grading still heavily came down to the teacher. (Swedish being the most obvious one)

I do believe teachers response of how the reform worked out should be listened to and that changes should be made so that things work out better for everyone, but I do believe the reform was with good intent and to give demands that are a bit more uniform and not just trying to make students better at studying for the test.",,/r/europe/comments/e5dwtp/pisa_2018_results/f9pf297/,Mippen123,1575532811

5122,"&gt; Armenian diaspora is far more fanatical 

Again I reiterate, your observation is flawed. Having talked with Armenians, I have seen the opposite. 

&gt; hold onto the genocide to preserve their identity 

 Armenian identity is one of the oldest continuing cultural identities in the planet. Their myths, stories, food, literature, architecture, etc. stretches back to the first civilizations of Asia Minor. To claim that genocide is somehow the only thing that unites them is false. I think the reason why you claim that is because you only looked at Armenians through the lens of genocide.

&gt;  i didn't say i expected something 

It is not that you said you expected something. It is the fact that you point out ""Armenians hate us"" on the topic of Armenian Genocide, as if that is somehow the moral low ground.

&gt; hates me because of my heritage 

They don't hate you because of your heritage. And you'd be surprised how much shared heritage you have with Armenians.

&gt; bases their entire identity on hating Turks 

This is a prime example of ""pot calling the kettle black"". Given that the Turkish identity is based upon the rejection of the obvious Greek-Anatolian-Armenian origin of the ""Turkish"" people, and instead adoption of Turkic invaders of Anatolia, I'd say it's the Turkish identity that revolves around a phobia of Armenians.",Armenian Highlands,/r/europe/comments/e5w379/lithuanian_president_turkeys_recognition_of/f9pa1b7/,cervanto96,1575526762

Or how about the fact the 28 HDP mayors are removed just for bieng Kurdish when they were legally elected.

I bet the Armenians would have been classified as terriroists in the early 1900s had the term been abused like it is today. And its obvious your state is hypocritical because they look at all Kurds as terriroists but support ACTUAL terrorism groups like ISIS and the Muslim Brotherhood.

If you think a Kurdish problem is non-existent then obviously you are bieng ignorant on purpose. It doesn't mean there isnt a Kurdish problem just because Kurds live in a major city hub like Istanbul or visit there because of daily needs. Maybe tell those Kurds that were BURNED in a basement in eastern Turkey by the Turkish state a few years ago if there is a Kurdish problem.

This is why the Saudis denominate trade in oil (20% of world trade) in dollars. Why did Europe get screwed so much by the 2008 financial crisis? Because European banks had been desperate to buy dollar assets (no matter how crappy). 

The United States dollar reigns supreme in spite of itself. The United States is led by a syphillitic madman. His party nearly drove the US into default on its debts twice in recent years (the debt ceiling crisis), and its partisans are clearly willing to endorse just about any deviation from the rule of law.   

Control over the reserve currency is a nice perk. You can get lots of imports without buying much from the rest of the world because people need your currency. Financial crises become a ""them"" problem not a ""you"" problem. And in bad times, it is the holder of the reserve currency that gets to choose who gets rescued and who doesn't. 

The free world needs Europe to come together, so it can take its place as the senior partner of the a broad democratic alliance. Supplant the dollar and the rest will be easy.

5341,"&gt;	Europe would either be speaking Russian, or be constantly at war with itself without that indispensable US providing public goods at no cost to Europeans.

Europe certainly has a lot to be thankful for to the US. Indeed Europe enjoyed a rather peaceful last 70 years, at least partly due to relatively low levels of standing armies. 

The situation that arose after 1945 was one that benefitted almost everyone. Europe, certainly, but the US too. The US built its global hegemony on the back of the western alliance, something the US could never have achieved on its own.

Not to mention that Europe and its overseas colonies financed a lot of the US’ wealth by lending vast sums of money to finance two world wars that twice nearly bankrupted all of Europe. That’s where Wall Street really made a lot of money, starting in the 1910s. It in effect transferred the wealth of several global empires to the US.

So, ‘at no cost’ is a bit of an oversimplification.

But that era seems to be coming to an end, and so it’s time that Europe again take responsibility for itself. 

And it doesn’t change the fact that although there’s plenty we can learn from the US, that country is not the beacon of bright light that it likes to see itself as.

5348,"&gt; It has nothing to do with it shifting it to China. It's shifting incentives of accounting games that are happening. Creating solar power panels requires CO2 and pollution, but it all happens in China so you don't count it in your numbers. 

Mate ... your own numbers just showed that there's a minor increase when looking at embedded numbers, and even when accounting for that the US (and Canada) are still *miles* ahead of their trans-Atlantic allies in CO2 output/capita.

Why can Denmark, Sweden, UK, Germany, Italy, etc all maintain a quality of life very similar to the US, Canada, and Australia, but with less than half of the CO2 output/capita?

Why constantly blame China when you are among the *absolute* worst on the planet?

You don't find it messed up that you and your countrymen release 30% more GHG (embedded) each compared to your British counterparts?

&gt;You guys have barely decreased your supply of Oil and Natural gas. It's been increasing in last year. America makes the most clean Shale gas on the planet. This is a massive reduction in CO2, and will accelerate.

And yet the EU is on track to reduce CO2 output by more than Canada and the US in 2019 - and has for the past year reduced CO2 output (also when looking at embedded numbers) by far more than any other region on earth.

We produce more nuclear energy, more renewable energy, and have a more efficient vehicle fleet + household consumption than Canada and the US. So why do you keep complaining?

It's like whining about the top performing student because he didn't get 100% straight A's ... while utterly ignoring all the F's you yourself are receiving.

&gt;You really need to account for fact USA has increased it's population by 30% since 1990 vs 7% EU-28, to understand how much greater the challenges are.

And then you also need to understand that in 1990 half of the EU countries had *just* come out of crushing poverty &amp; communism. Despite lifting 100 million people out of poverty we *still* decreased our net CO2 output by a monumental margin.

I've shown you both total and per capita numbers ... and North America is a complete failure in both regards.

&gt;America is decreasing it's CO2 usage. It's just way more economical to happen. Tesla is an American company with tons of subsides that went it's way, some as high as 20k with tax rebates. So yes research is happening.

So what you're trying to say is: America didn't bother decreasing it's CO2 output for 25 years straight, and then it started happening because other nations carried the brunt of the initial cost &amp; development.

Now that there were a few years of decrease it's somehow an excuse ... even though 2018 saw an increase - and do remember that your government is fighting as hard as it can to make sure those decreases remain as low as possible, and perhaps increase again.

&gt;This is the same old European witch hunt that has always happened. I seriously don't know why you keep drinking the Kool Aid.

There's no witch hunt. North America (led by the US) is the single largest cumulative GHG emitter on earth.

This, quite literally, means that you, your countrymen, and your ancestors, bear the largest responsibility for the utter cluster-fuck that our species is facing.

Look at a graph of CO2 output per capita (yeah, the embedded one) and look when certain nations started acting and others haven't done jack shit ... including Canada.

&gt;The warming doesn't happen in a straight line, it can slow down for a moment, then jump, and so on.

Great to hear that. Now show me any of the IPCC models that predicted a 10+ year hiatus in the trend. Right... you can't because none of them did. So once again, they **FAILED**.

&gt;For example, we know volcanic eruptions have a massive impact on the climate in the short term, as they release aerosols.

As I stated, there are a number of factors that impact climate change. Only one side is hell bent on claiming that CO2 alone (and specifically that produced by human activity) has (or better yet, will have) a **catastrophic** impact on the climate. And I mean that LITERALLY. Many are on the record talking about how we're at the precipice of civilization-altering climate change all due to CO2.

&gt;What it means is that the main points, like that the climate is warming significantly due to human activity

Ah.. so when ice sheets were covering most of North America and Europe but then global warming made them disappear, was that a result of human activity? Was it a result of dinosaur flatulence (in reference to a [NASA](https://climate.nasa.gov/faq/33/which-is-a-bigger-methane-source-cow-belching-or-cow-flatulence/) climate change article and other [media](https://www.forbes.com/sites/samlemonick/2017/09/29/scientists-underestimated-how-bad-cow-farts-are/#5693405b78a9) reports on cows)? 

Tell me again why the concern exists about (even if you subscribe to the theory) humans causing climate change? Are you concerned that millions or billions of humans will die (or maybe we'll all become extinct)? If that happens, CO2 production will eventually decrease, and the planet will once again balance itself out. What we do know is that THUS FAR, food production has not been impacted, so we're all doing alright. Human population keeps growing. Livestock population keeps growing. All this while CO2 levels have increased and global warming has not been ""effectively tackled"" for over 3 decades (or more, depending on when you wish to review the alarmist concerns about this topic).",,/r/europe/comments/e540wb/only_a_bunch_of_fanatics_deny_climate_change/f9oy8tr/,GeorgePapadopoulos,1575516603

It's fine at the moment no need to change things.

&gt; Denmark cannot represent you better as it has no power on the world stage comparatively to the European nation, it's just basic politics, if you cannot see that I am sorry, read some history books, maybe they give you a perspective

Security/defense, rule of law and European values *could* mean a federal union. Tackling those problems would be a lot easier within a federalized EU, but again, doesn't have to be.

How did I miss the topic? I was trying to illustrate how the whole point of every EU treaty has always been to explicitly encroach on national sovereignty, to use your terms. I’m sure there’s opposition, it would be worrisome if there wouldn’t be. But I’m stating my opinions here.

I meant in that sense, because the Council represents the interests of memberstates, whereas EP represents the interests of the people. And while I agree with moving more power to EP, it moves the balance of power away from the national leaders, and to the MEPs.

That said I think you are right, TBH I'd quite like the council &amp; parliament to be equal, so they both set the agenda for the commission and both need to sign-off commission work, commissioned by the EP.

TBH I think we need to constantly adjust the balance, as otherwise we might end up like the US, where the house's work is constantly blocked by the Senate for partisan reasons, rather than to protect the interests of the states.

And secondly not all broken rules have the same impact, trying to undermine the independence of the courts weights quite a bit heavier than being a couple weeks late to implement the newest regulation on some random trade rule.

Yes, that would be my ideal scenario as well. Let the Executive be just that, just execute the tasks set by whatever comes out of the fight between the demos and the nation states. We don’t need no European President, at least, not in the mold of the USA. 

&gt;	TBH I think we need to constantly adjust the balance, as otherwise we might end up like the US, where the house's work is constantly blocked by the Senate for partisan reasons, rather than to protect the interests of the states.

I agree again. The USA is I think a bad example to follow. Its political system has unfortunately degenerated. Part of that has to do with the nuts and bolts of the system (Europe should prevent a two-party system *at all costs*), part of it is the almost religious status of the laws, the Constitution above all. 

But part of the problem is also the US’ tendency to see itself as God-given and indispensable. That’s a flaw that affects all successful nations sooner or later, and it’s something Europe should, especially given its extensive experience with such matters, work hard to avoid.

You really need to account for fact USA has increased it's population by 30% since 1990 vs 7% EU-28, to understand how much greater the challenges are.

America is decreasing it's CO2 usage. It's just way more economical to happen. Tesla is an American company with tons of subsides that went it's way, some as high as 20k with tax rebates. So yes research is happening.

Regardless,  


1. They barely campaigned about abortions. They are legal in Sweden, there are few to no political reasons to be against it nowadays. 
2. Their core question was immigration. And I'm not talking your average ""build a wall"" kind, they have had representatives literally calling immigrants slurs (on many, many occasions, both IRL and online), had elected representatives arm themselves with iron rods threateing to beat immigrants. They rose to power because of their xenophobia. Only years AFTER that they started to focus on other topics, such as healthcare. 
3. They have nazi roots but they still have nazi members among them to this day. Nobody bats an eye when an SD member gets outed wearing an arm band or anonymously posting antisemitism online nowadays, because it happens too frequently. Regardless of that, not even 25 years ago they were a straight-edge nazi party and those sympathizers have remained within the party.
4. And no, S is losing votes as people get older. Their voters are also uneducated baby boomers. Simple as that.

5811,Boeing has been developing a plane to fit in where the 757 was called the New Midsized Airplane concept. It would most likely be called the 797 if they decide to make it. In fact the A321XLR was a variant developed specifically to compete with what Boeing appears to be doing. If the 797 does go ahead and it's not too late then it could end up with the upper hand on the A321. They would over lap when it comes to range and seat capacity but ulitmately the 797 would probably have higher maximums for both.,civis europa sum,/r/europe/comments/e5wnbm/the_american_airline_united_airlines_has_chosen/f9n1ra4/,w00dy2,1575475116

You can move your troops and to strike specific targets, but you are not allowed to keep your troops there - Strikes on specific targets on foreign soil are allowed in cases of self defence. Stationing your troops without immediate purpose to strike specific targets (aka occupation) is not.

&gt;Afghanistan

You mean this:

&gt;United Nations Security Council resolution 1386, adopted unanimously on 20 December 2001, after reaffirming all resolutions on the situation in Afghanistan, particularly resolutions 1378 (2001) and 1383 (2001), the Council authorised the establishment of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) to **assist the Afghan Interim Authority in the maintenance of security in Kabul and surrounding areas**

Assisting local authority to secure the Capital and surrounding areas is not the same as go and bomb the whole country to the middle ages and occupy it for decades..

&gt;Libya

Again, no, only no fly zone was approved. 


&gt;Continuous can mean several things here, what exactly do you mean?

Well, the obvious thing, a continuous presence as presence without set end-goal. Initial goal was to protect Iraq from IS attacks from Syrian soil (That what gave the operation some semblance of legitimacy), that was done years ago. Then it was defeat of ISIS (This is already completely illegal, as this can only be done with Syrian government consent), this was also done. Now it is between Trump who wants to ""protect oil"", and some others who want to ""protect Kurds"" or something.

As for cheese and wine, I assume it was not meant to be taken literally. It’s not exploitation, it’s about maintaining the relevance of the French language in the 21st century. Of course there is some level of exploitation, but it is insignificant compared to what happened during the colonial era. I’m not sure it’s fair to say France is imperialist (a strong word); and racism is a grave accusation. 

You also put China on a pedestal for doing things better than France. Is that merely because you despise the west, or did you actually study the subject enough to forge an informed opinion?

The areas with a lot of social housing (e.g. Bispebjerg and Husum) don't have high rates of crime.
