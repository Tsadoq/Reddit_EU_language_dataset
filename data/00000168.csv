well thats not how it works. 

 It gets counted where it is casted, open to public, legally under the supervision of the party representatives ( all of them) at every single ballot box. There are more than 30000 ballot boxes in Istanbul. If they disagree about anything, process freezes until objector party can bring their attorneys on scene ( all parties would call upon at this point ) 

Countings get official if all parties' representatives of that said singular ballot confirm their signed (and now photographed) copies of the results with each other and document it far away from the election headquarters.

They can steal only if the opposition fails to have presence of at least two-three trained volunteers on duty, overlooking the box ( that contains few hundred votes total ), at every single step, with few thousand lawyers roaming around to adress hotspots of problem.

..as invaders trying to destroy their weak ass culture

I suppose so. Then again, just because our culture is so weak, is there something wrong in defending it by voting? Do you think we stay silent and bend over backwards due to respect? Don't confuse respect with fear. Below is an example of fear, not respect.

&gt; Sounds too me like excuses for xenophobia but what do I know

Ok. At what point, at what % of the population in a nation being non-native, from islamic cultures, does it stop being xenophobic wanting to have less immigration?

At what point did Coptic Egyptians stop being xenophobic against the Arabs, and just be worried about their own home and culture?

At what point did Constantinopole Greeks stop being xenophobic against the Turks and just be worried about their own home and culture?

At what point did Lebanese Jews and Christians stop being xenophobic against Muslims and just be worried about their own home and culture?

These were all a majority in their homelands at one point. Now these places are 99% Muslim. But who cares about history because you have some immigrant neighbors who are nice. By the way in the near future we can add Sweden to the above list.

&gt; Increasing it for violent crime will not only affect jailtime for those crimes, it will have an affect on all sentences as they are relative to each other...

Are you saying that increasing prison time for violent crimes leads to bigger jail time for non-violent crimes because those crimes are related to violence, so you can't do non-violent crimes without violence? Ok.

&gt; So they are the only party ignoring Finlands own responsibility for protecting the earth, while excusing this behavior with the kindergarten excuse of ""someone else is doing the same thing but much worse, punish them not me"".

199,"**Reply Part 1**

&amp;#x200B;

**""Wasn't talking about nazi stuff, no.""** 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for clarifying.

&amp;#x200B;

""**I was saying that you put country of origin before economical interrest. Nation before economics, strange for a former empire with many nations in it.""** 

&amp;#x200B;

I think we disagree on whether the UK's membership of the EU is beneficial to the UK economy, this may be something we will have to agree to disagree on. To clarify, the point I am making is not:  


""We must leave the EU and be damned the economic consequence"", on the contrary. The point I am making is ""We must leave the EU because of the economic consequence we have suffered and will continue to suffer as a result of remaining""

&amp;#x200B;

To repeat my previous point I would never accuse you of **intentionally trying to strawman** my argument; however it does look an awful lot like that when you represent my opinion as, **""Nation before Economics""**

&amp;#x200B;

**""Now, if you ask any group of people - hey, do you want more money? - they will answer YES. This is the fake economical translation of the referendum question. A lot of you guys stopped at this.""**

&amp;#x200B;

I have provided multiple economic arguments, and I am very equipped to provide more; however you have side stepped these and decided to discuss other topics instead. I would urge you to engage me on these points because you will be unable to change mine, and like minded individuals opinions without adressing these issues about:  


* Wage supression in the low and unskilled UK labour market.
* UK tax payer net contribution to EU budgets with a focus on developing Eastern Europe.
* European Union policy to strengthen the Eastern European manufacturing industries at the expense of the UK manufacturing Industry; using subsidies.

&amp;#x200B;

**""But when you go deep in what EU is, you realize it means education all over the continent, traveling, cheaper stuff, safety, quality etc.""**

&amp;#x200B;

**Citation needed.** I can't take your word for any of this and even if I did I would refer you to every other country outside of the EU which function at a higher level. A political union is not necessary for this and the costs outweigh the very meagre rewards.

&amp;#x200B;

**Why do countries like Japan and Canada have such highly rated education systems without being part of the EU or any kind of political union?** (1) Because a political union is not necessary.

&amp;#x200B;

**Furthermore, what has the EU done to help Germany out of their humiliating performance in the PISA test of 2002?** As far as I can gather all of the decisions made to pull their score up were made in the Bundestag; and by the individual Bundesländer's within Germany; not the EU parliament.  (2)

&amp;#x200B;

The United Kingdom has a very highly rated passport (3). We can already access a large portion of the Globe outside of the EU without the need for a VISA (4); and the EU have already confirmed we will not need a VISA to continue to travel to EU countries after we leave the political union (5).

&amp;#x200B;

To repeat my previous point about **""Cheaper stuff"":  ""Our default strategy has already been laid out and under WTO terms, and we would actually see a 7% increase in tarriff free imports."" (6)** In other words: from day one of leaving the European union we will see an immediate reduction in the price of goods. 

&amp;#x200B;

Your points about safety, quality etc are too vague for me to adress.

266,"Definition of Fascism:

Facism is a form of right-wing, authoritarian ultranationalism, characterized by dictatorial power, forcible suppression of opposition, and strong regimentation of society and the economy.

14 defining characteristics of fascism as put forward by Mussolini survivor Umberto Eco:

1. The cult of tradition - Within the group originating the movement, traditionallist thinkers serve to enhance and amplify the core beliefs.

2. The rejection of modernism - Scientific and societal developments since the renaissance are shunned as depraved, societal depravity didn't exist before these developments.

3. The cult of action for action's sake - Acting before thinking it through is always right, thinking before acting is a sign of weakness.

4. Disagreement is treason - To distinguish is to be modernistic, to follow without questioning is to be right.

5. Fear of difference - Appeal against foreigners, they are intruders and the enemy. 

6. Appeal to social frustration - Appeal to the perceived struggles of the middle class, exploit their fear of lower classes and political humiliation.

7. The obsession with a plot - Followers must feel like they are besieged, exploit latent xenophobia.

8. The enemy is both strong and weak - Change rhetoric to agravate fear and hate towards enemies.

9. Pacifism is trafficking with the enemy - Not taking action is betrayal.

10. Contempt for the weak - Those who aren't powerful are unimportant.

11. Everybody is educated to become a hero - A cult to ""heroism""

12. Machismo and weaponry - Women and people who aren't straight are lower beings, being anything but straight is a crime.

13. Selective populism - The opinion of a select group in society is presented as the majorities opinion.

14. Newspeak - Limit what and how people can say something, and their ability to fight back diminishes.",,/r/europe/comments/bmbjp8/74_years_after_hitlers_defeat_fascism_on_the_rise/emvlq0i/,Mr_1RaE,1557359962

&gt;Anyway, the list you've written yourself does not mention Germany, as Salzburg has only been part of Germany from 1938 to 1945

Nationality, if defined as basically the same as ethnicity, is not really contingent on official citizenship. Of course we are talking of the German culture and the German people when we say Mozart or Beethoven or Bach were German. And both culture and people existed in 1756.

If nationality just refers to a place of birth, then the Empire was of course of the *nationis germanicae*, of the German nation. So Mozart had Salzburgian, and Imperial Roman-German ""nationality"".

- CDU which is centrist/conservative and would rather not rock the boat. Deciding things also has the disadvantage that people start voting AfD.

- SPD which is on a soul-searching mission and otherwise finds big industry and smoking smoke stacks very sexy.

- FDP which only cares for the upper crust. Nothing should disturb them getting even richer.

- The Greens who believe nuclear is too dangerous and wind farms are ugly (also not good for your cosmic balance). Industry is icky so they'd rather not go too deep.

- AfD who believe climate change is fake news created by ((them)) to destroy hard-working German's livelihood.

- Die Linke who doesn't care but would rather have communism back.

Voters usually want CO2 reduction but no high-voltage power lines, no wind farms, no nuclear power plants and no additional taxes or costs. So, it takes 10y+ to build a high-voltage transmission line from offshore wind-farms to the industrial centers. Astonishingly, this curtails the appetite of investors to build new wind farms.

Auto industry is our sacred cow. They wanted to not be pestered with hybrid drive trains and shit but build powerful combustion engines with lots of hps. So, they lobbied parliament to not overdo things. Manufacturing is actually pretty good at conserving energy, but since we try to ensure *we* produce every single fucking machine, tool, and engine on this planet, power thirst of industry is not going down (bc output is constantly rising).

Lignite is still produced domestically because jobs, so it would be a shame to not burn it. Esp. since that would lead to ~1000 additional unemployed in the east where they vote either Die Linke (give me back the GDR) or AfD (give me back Hitler).

Ah, yes, certainly. Because Germany's worst injustices have always been committed by the evil lefties.

&gt; Examples? ""Sytematic"" is a tell tale term that your examples are mostly by some random drunk facebook users which were swiftly condemend by everyone else.

Just a moment ago you were talking about right wing extremists gaining support -- you can't have your cake and eat it, too, and the spike in hate speech is well documented, as are its effects on peoples' lives.

The problem, of course, lies in social media providing people with echo chambers. You do not have a discourse with opposing opinions like the two of us having here (as little as I believe either of us is going to convince the other); instead, automated algorythms are drip-feeding people the sort of content they want to see, and enable them to join groups of likeminded people with extremist opinions, where they will radicalize one another as they feel these opinions becoming normalized.

It is only when they leave this bubble, this safe space, that they get confronted with how an outsider to these groups may feel, and then they're suddenly wondering as to why they ""get called a Nazi"" just for saying this and that, not even noticing how they've slipped.

The internet creating these parallel societies is one of the biggest challenges of our times.

Holodomor is actually a lot closer to a lot of Polish families. A lot of them were separeted by ""allies"" deciding on a lot of shifts in border all across Eastern Europe. So yes, it does affect Polish families directly, since families reunions across these borders are a thing, and lot of Polish nationals, or descendants thereof suffered from the same food shortage as Ukrainian nationals, as suddenly they were considered Ukrainian nationals. 

The other thing, mentioned also in the thread, was Katyn massacre, which was mass-murder of Polish civilians, executed on USSR orders. How can you call someone an ally, when that ally deliberately murders all of highly educated people of your country and hunts down any democratic opposition left?

 Do not get me wrong, I am not trying to quantify human suffering here, but the discussion was about Eastern Europe and bringing Central Asia(Indian sub-continent, if you will) issues does nothing to further discussion on European matters, and distracts attention from the original topic.

545,"Well since most of the focus of libertarian economical philosophies is on the dismantling of the central state and its institutions in favour of private ownership and the free market, I will present a few arguments why this can never work.

Imagine that tomorrow we do abolish central state and privatize all state property and functions. The people with the necessary ressources would then buy out all state property and would put a price on everything we need as a society to survive and to grow.

First, lets think about the more simple things. You go into your neighborhood park, before it was free, but now a libertarian society you have to pay a price cause it is private. You sit on a bench there, you also have to pay if the bench is a private property. You go to buy a sandwich and get a food poisoning from it. In our current system you can sue the sandwich vendor for a breach of the contract you have made. If there isn’t a state to define what contracts are and provide courts where you can make your claim, what exactly can you do?

You walk further in the park and you get beaten and robbed. You had all of your money with you. Who are you going to report the crime to? If we assume that there are private agencies which have overtaken the job done by the police now, they would require a payment so that they can help you. But when you don’t have any money, you can’t pay them. You also can’t pay health care professionals to take a look at your wounds from the beating cause you again you don’t have anything to pay them with.

Second, libertarism is bound to create a society where the inequality between the class of people that possess things and those that don’t would be immeasurable. Social mobility would be impossible because education would be private and thus only for the people with the means to afford it. Also the moment you are without a job there will be no social security to make sure that you don’t end up homeless and starving.

Lastly, it is very possible that big owners will in time devour small owners if there is no regulation on the market. In the end everything will be the property of one (or maybe a fer more) person in the world who would then be the only one pulling profit thus collapsing the entire economic system.

All that being said, I don’t believe that there are many people with higher degrees of education who would support such an economic ideology considering the many disasterous implications it will have for our society.",,/r/europe/comments/bm355k/on_average_europe_is_doing_pretty_ok_for_press/emuklc0/,kurtymurty,1557337352

561,"&gt; useless in combating what they purport to combat, dangerous in restricting normal law abiding citizens not part of powerful activist lobbyist groups.

Hmm. Considering the many decades these laws have been in effect without a degradation in civil freedoms, I think they've done a good job.

Of course, what is a ""law abiding citizen"" for one person may be what the law is supposed to counter for another.

&gt; My take: If you dont want your political opponents to style themselves victims, dont victimize them.

By that logic we could do away with just about any law on the grounds that, say, a ""Reichsbürger"" might feel victimized because the state punishes them for refusing to pay outstanding debts, or a misogynist feels victimized because the state punishes them for sexual harassment.

Some people are simply unteachable, and any educational effect a punishment might have is lost on them. That doesn't mean the punishment should be foregone, because it *also* sends a signal to society at large. And from what I can see, we have not yet reached a point where society at large has much pity for racists being fined for hate speech. The only ones who consider them victims of ""state oppression"" are those who share their extremist opinions and are liable to repeat them.

&gt; I deny that this bald faced assertion is in any way true.

You do not consider it as undermining a demographic's right to dignity and right to pursuit of happiness when they are systematically targeted by hate speech for the explicit purpose of making their lives miserable? This sounds like a rather unemphatic statement to me.

&gt; It is the one right citizens can use to protect themselves from tyranny of others since it grants you the power of persuasion, the power to show violation.

This does not require 100% unrestricted freedom of speech. Explain to me, please, how the current hate speech laws are undermining the citizenry's ability to argue against tyranny?

And if you really believe that a *minority* can level the same persuasive power as a large mob, you don't understand much about social dynamics. The best arguments are useless in the face of populism -- as history has shown already.

1) that's some nice fallacy you got there
2) only one group is actually convinced that more power to.states is helpful, and those are the ones who'd love to see labour laws, discrimination laws, worker protection laws, minimum wage laws etc. Etc. Go out the window.
There is a place for states to have their own control in the US, but pretending that if all power were given to the states that this would fix everything is beyond naive.

Corruption, bribery, downright self-enrichment is so much easier if the state is powerless to stop you. Don't discriminate against women? We can do that, state rights. 
Skirt safety and environmental laws? We can do that, state rights.


Even if we pretend just one single state would be a corrupt hellhole, and zero chance of that, that still means that these people could dump waste across the border, be a hive for smuggling operations and money laundering, make it legal to only hire white, straight, christian men etc. Etc

Also, its a fact that WW2 changed our political perspective: stuff that was considered acceptable before was condemned after, because linked to the regimes. Mostly that was a good thing, since the new opportunities of the '900 hadn't historical precedents, which made difficult to actually understand how something could have impacted over the world.
WW2 wasn't fought to teach us something, but it definitely did, and forgetting that does make the war look useless from an historic point of view: what happened in the past matters for us only if we understand the implications of that.

When he got back with those tractor parts, he was simply amazed that people were still running the tractors, and, initially angry, believed that his business associate asked him to bring those parts out-of-the-blue.

https://rsf.org/en/ranking_table

Click on a given nation and you will get the reasoning in a summary

However things that can affect the rating negatively:

* health of competition in the media landscape (media monopoly? Media monopoly controlled by mostly government connected entities like Hungary? etc.)
* no protection of whistleblowers (or even criminalizing them)
* violence against journalists, this includes mob violence
* direct control of the government on publicly owned media
* bad transparency laws / government not reacting to questions of the press / only answering questions of outlets ""loyal"" to them
* amount of fake news and hoaxes / propaganda
* threats made by elected officials regarding the press (like elected officials saying they want certain journalists imprisoned or worse)

So a good situation of freedom of press is not only what's on paper legally, but also about the behavior between the government and population towards the press and uncomfortable investigations. Even if a government has freedom of press, if the population reacts with mob violence against any type of journalist entity because they don't like what they are writing, it will affect the rating negatively.

Additionally: even Germany's situation became worse since last year, however it looks good in comparison to almost everybody else (especially those under populist governments, such as Austria which fell from 11, better than Germany, to 16 and into the ""Satisfactory"" tier) which have worsened A LOT.

862,"Have you heard the PhDs that argue against you preconceived notions on race? There’s a lot of propaganda against the concept of race in science because of it’s misuse to justify racism in the past. It’s is very taboo and therefore discouraged. The main iimperatives against it are, however, political and social. This makes scientists shy away from evidence that does indeed prove that distinct races exist. The differents are fairly superficial but they do exist. Sub-saharan africans have different body morphology than Europeans say they have evolved and adapted in different climates. It’s why blacks have more melanin, longer limbs, less hair and smaller skulls. These differences are real and it is what constitutes different races. They are not very consequential and the social aspect, like you said, has been overblown and abused. However the evidence, no matter how taboo it might be, speaks for itself.

There are cases of issues as a result of vaccinations hence why there are vaccine compensation courts.

I already said having a general be a minister isnt what i was advocating for at all. Im advocating for having served, in any rank at any unit, and making budgets harder to change. 

&amp;#x200B;

Youre the one making several misleading statements. From the very link you yourself sent:

&amp;#x200B;

 Tom Middendorp heeft in zijn afscheidstoespraak als Commandant der Strijdkrachten felle kritiek geuit op 25 jaar bezuinigingen op de krijgsmacht. Hoewel het mortierongeluk in Mali volgens hem niet volledig aan geldgebrek te wijten is, zei hij geworsteld te hebben met de slinkende budgetten. 

&amp;#x200B;

He very clearly states that isnt fully the fault of budget cuts. Well no shit. A budget cut doesnt force you to buy faulty equipment, but it DOES enable the situation where the military is forced to resort to drastic measures. Its not about being able to create money out of nowhere, thats another misleading statement from your side. I never said budget cuts should be illegal or that ministers shouldnt be able to touch the budget. Im claiming it should be harder. And long, long before the current and previous one? I mean, **obviously**. That has been a trend in all of western Europe since 1990. 

&amp;#x200B;

Well, then, what to do about these 150 million remaining cars? Converting them to hybrids, you say? This is not nearly enough. At best a hybrid will have emissions 30% lower than an ICE, so all in all you managed to get a 65% reduction in emissions from the transportation sector.

There will need to be disassembly and reassembly, inspections, repairs, making new parts. For this, you will need all sorts of resources, teams of high-paid professonials who only work on refurbishing rockets, and so on.

But if you instead just build a new rocket every time, you can streamline the process. You have a standardised direct system that produces every part that is needed, has its inspected, assembles it and so on. No need to disassemble, no reason to go through every part again and find unexpected damage etc.

If you want the rocket to land, you also to throw away a lot of its capability compared to if you can just let it fall and crash. So the refurbshing has to make up for this loss in capability.

- We have universal healthcare, however crappy. When you consider that uninsured people in the West can literally go bankrupt over a major sickness, it ain't that bad for us.  
- We also have a lot more labour rights than people generally have in the US (guaranteed vacation time, separate paid sick days, etc.).  
- You are a lot less likely to get shot by either bad guys or cops.  
- We have a pretty okay public transport system in general. In Denmark for example it costs an arm and a leg to get around, and to be fair it isn't better than what we have.
- Budapest is a world-class city with things to see and do. It's easy to downplay it if you don't have a point of reference, but really, it's great.  
- If you disregard the ridiculous state of the real estate market and the cost of rent, it's dirt cheap to just exist in general compared to the West (In Manchester, the cost of a single ""triangle"" sandwitch is like 1900 forints).

&gt; A 37-year-old former addict-turned-activist, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that bonzai seemed to put the entire community into a collective coma. Once a politically charged neighborhood known for rowdy anti-government demonstrations, Bayramtepe became eerily quiet once residents developed a taste for this drug. “You can't find 10 people to protest against anything,” he said. “People can't do their jobs, they don't do any daily activities,"" he added.

Statistically the US imprisons a larger part of their own population than any other nation in history. Statistically speaking the wealth gap in the US is growing. Statistically Americans today are economically far worse off than their parents or grandparents were, and will never have any opportunity to change that. Statistically speaking a not insignificant amount of people will die, or have their lives ruined by excessive medical bills, completely unnecessarily, since the US can easily afford single payer. Statistics say you have a massive problem with violence in your society that isn't reflected anywhere else. It's not just how people are, it's Americans specifically.

All of these statistics are just as real as US GDP being the world's highest, as well as having the largest military, which is no wonder since you spend more on it than the next 13 other countries combined, most of which are allies.

You don't measure how good your society is by how many tanks you have, or how much money your incompetent politicians are allowing corporations to steal from you. You measure it in things that make life better for your average citizen. Good education *(which you don't have until university, and then at ridiculous costs)* a safe place to live, healthy and safe food to eat and water to drink, job security, fair wages, fair working hours, healthcare, time off from work.

All things the US sucks at from a European perspective. Your country makes a lot of money, but you don't collect your fair share of it as taxes.

Does that include the circlejerk of hate? Like, I haven't ever encountered an ""anti-vaxxer"", but on reddit I see people hating on them all the time in their absence, and hard, with a really disgusting Schadenfreude sometimes. It reminds me of that edgy interwebs atheist fad, where people thought just because they weren't into a specific stupid thing, that they themselves couldn't possibly be stupid.

I mean, of all the things that threaten our societies and our health, like the incredible and yet still growing disparity between rich and poor, marketing peddling alcohol, [pollution](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ella-kissi-debrah-could-become-first-death-attributed-to-air-pollution-in-united-kingdom/), people who start wars of aggression being still welcome at gala dinners... even in countries where pretty much everybody is vaccinated, *this* is the subject that gets the blood boiling? Measles, not, say, cancer caused by depleted uranium in a war of aggression? ""*angry moms looked for reasons and reconciliation so they can live with themselves because they need someone to blame*"", **that** is the shoe size people are going for? Bah. I've seen people downvoted into the double digits for merely asking honest questions, and being called ""antivaxxer"" for just that, it's already a slur. That is part of the circus, not the solution to it. Russia doesn't just fund one side of such issues, you know? *Any* ""side"" that dehumanizes, and talks about rather than to, is their friend, when it comes to undermining social cohesion.

&gt; The Estonian view is that Russian secret services systematically try to find or create tension within the society, and that Russia used the refugee crisis to put pressure on the public and on governments to split the EU. War and violence in Syria, with Russia as one of the main players, would increase the refugee flow to Europe. Russia would then provide financial, ideological and media support to populists opposing the migrants, and at the same time support leftist populists, based on historical and ideological ties. These three groups, refugees, national populists and leftist populists, would then be pitched against each other, creating splits and division within the EU.

So, step one to resist this influence would be to talk to people rather than about them, rather than 99% charging themselves up with self-righteous hatred against 1%.

1478,"Thanks, very witty. Though you still have to explain in whichever way this is relevant. As you have brilliantly concluded unit labor costs is not wage per hour but rather wage per produced unit which is leaps and bounds more serviceable in the comparisson of competitiveness than just wage per hour. 

If you pay worker X in Slowland a mere 0,5€ per hour to produce a single Sandwich or worker Y in Fastland 20€ to produce 200 sandwiches in one hour it's obvious which you pick, right? The unit labour costs of worker Y are 1/5 of worker X. Letting wages grow significantly slower than productivity is still a form of wage surpression.

Furthermore if you would have actually [checked the data](https://data.oecd.org/lprdty/gdp-per-hour-worked.htm) before posting you would know that Germany's productivity grew very slowly, so slowly that it's not a particularly relevant factor, especially if you consider that the growth is almost 1:1 the same as in France or Spain and they don't seem to have quite the same problem as Germany. 

Where you can actually see this having an impact is mainly Greece and Ireland. Greece experienced a sharp decline in productivity after the financial crisis and as a result the greek unit labor costs still seems relatively high (another factor is that wages rarely drop). In Irelland an extremely steep rise in productivity happened which is why Ireland's unit labor costs plummets like that. However it is to be noted that Ireland didn't actually get massively more productive, their GDP surged due to them being probably the biggest tax haven in Europe. As productivity measures GDP per working hour, it went through the roof, even though for the average worker nothing much changed in the short run. See also [Leprechaun economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leprechaun_economics). Note that in general huge statistical spikes like this are more likely to happen in small countries. Of the big european economies the only one where productivity could be said to have an impact is Italy which has stagnating productivity which makes it hard for them to readjust their unit labour costs because wages rarely fall, unless when in crisis.",For a Europe of the Regions!,/r/europe/comments/blsy3w/latest_2019_gdp_forecasts_for_eu28/emscq7o/,tobias_681,1557274745

These people do not produce anything.

No, they *consume* taxes, that's the big problem. The amount of money the government must raise through taxes and inflation to pay those people is strangling the Argentinian economy. Nobody has capital to invest because taxation is so high.

With fewer public sector employees the Argentine government would be able to lower taxes, allowing people to invest in production. This investment would create jobs to replace those lost in the public sector.

What the leftist governments in Argentina have done is to create a lot of public ""jobs"" where the people have nothing to do, they just receive a salary. It's almost like a universal basic income system. The problem is that this removes investment from the productive system and gives it to people who only consume without producing anything.

1635,"&gt;Facebook has assembled a team in Dublin to monitor for misinformation ahead of European Parliament elections in May, gathering 40 people at its European headquarters to fight against any attempt to manipulate the outcome of the vote through its apps.

&gt;The team, made up of data scientists, engineers, and cyber security officers, are part of a 500-person effort to monitor elections across the world and will work on the EU vote in the run-up to the May 20 ballot. The team will also have policy experts from each of the 28 countries holding elections and native speakers in all 24 official EU languages.

&gt;“We all come together because even though we are a tech company, it turns out speaking face-to-face is really helpful,” said Lexi Sturdy, who oversees the real-time election operations. The goal, she added, was to speed up response times to manipulations of the platform, allowing Facebook to “take down content proactively, and at scale.”

&gt;The effort comes after fears among European policymakers that this ballot will be a target for misinformation campaigns, either by Russia or by fringe parties in each of the member states.

&gt;Facebook recently banned a number of far-right individuals and organisations from its platforms, including Tommy Robinson, founder of the English Defence League, who recently launched his candidacy for the north-west of England in the European elections.

	The company said individuals who were banned for being hate figures would remain banned, even if they were democratically elected. “There are today elected representatives that are not allowed on the platform, like Golden Dawn in Greece,” said Richard Allan, Facebook’s vice-president for global policy. “It’s not a comfortable position to be in, but this is the trade-off.”

	If somebody is actively stirring up real world violence, whether or not they are elected representatives, they don’t get a place,” he added.

&gt;In the past week alone, the team said it had detected hundreds of anomalous behaviours around political topics on Facebook and Instagram, Ms Sturdy said, that has led, in some cases, to removal of voter supression material. Examples of flagged content could include viral politically-charged photos, comments or live videos, or unusually large numbers of invitations to a specific political group that will be reviewed for their veracity.

&gt;“For instance, people in the room . . . might see a big ‘virality’ around polling day in Portugal, the goal is we can get to [misinformation] in minutes rather than waiting for it to be flagged to a fact checker,” said Mr Allan.

They are literally fighting against fellow Ukrainians who turned against their new Ukrainian government. The only place Russia actually invaded is Crimea, and they did that with very little opposition. Yes, Russia is heavily involved in Donbass, but that doesn't mean only Russians fight on the other side. Ukraine has always been a divided country between the Western Ukrainians, and Eastern Ukrainians, and both the West and Russia have taken advantage of that. 

Then again, calling the invasion ""unprovoked"" after a pro-EU and pro-West coup happens is quite a stretch.

The Libyan National Army Air Force mostly relies on Egyptian and Emirate pilots, also some older Libyans, less on international mercenaries.  
  
The Mirage F1 that was shot down was not a Portuguese aircraft, Portugal never operated this type, but an aircraft delivered to the Libyan Arab Air Force by France decades ago when Ghaddafi was still around.

Somebody has to train the Venezuelans how to use it.

Only the public infrastructure is accounted for by taxation. Most of the public services we pay for are necessary and / or useful, some are more so, and some are very less so, but having so many infrastructures publicly managed means waste and financial inefficiency, typical of all public spending, which yields to an unnecessarily high tax burden for everybody. If I was granted the chance to decide which services my tax money is spent on, and which services don't receive my tax, such services would enter in competition with one another to maximize my satisfaction, increase cost-efficiency, and would reduce waste for the sake of being competitive and palatable within a real market rather than within a political framework financially sustainable only with mandatory taxation. This is largely not the case for public spending, where the management routinely demonstrates that queues, waiting times, service availability, efficiency and costs can be kept just at a mediocre level, because the ""customers"" will keep paying regardless.

1698,"There were no open air slave markets in Ghadaffi's Libya, the country was able to protect its borders and was not a hotbed for ISIS and other terrorists – international wanted terrorists who now often operate under cover of the Government of National Accord in Libya.

Most if not all of the GNA's air force pilots are mercenaries, so is the guy in the article. He claims to be from Portugal, the GNA-AF has contracted mercenaries from Ukraine, Ecuador, United States and other places to operate its air fleet. This is well proven. ( e.g. [[1]](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/libyan-militia-building-mercenary-air-force-rivals-claim) [[2]](https://www.google.com/search?ei=seHRXKi_GtCJk74P36y32Ag&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2Fwar-is-boring%2Fgreat-now-there-are-two-competing-libyan-air-forces-843114cfec35&amp;oq=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2Fwar-is-boring%2Fgreat-now-there-are-two-competing-libyan-air-forces-843114cfec35&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3...443331.443331..443509...0.0..0.115.115.0j1......0....2j1..gws-wiz.......0i71.uGzztWS7x9w) )The Libyan National Army Air Force mostly relies on Egyptian and Emirate pilots, also some older Libyans – pilots who still flew in the pre-2011 air force are quite old now – less on international mercenaries.  
  
The Mirage F1 that was shot down was not a Portuguese aircraft, Portugal never operated this type, but an aircraft delivered to the Libyan Arab Air Force by France decades ago when Ghaddafi was still around. Many decommissioned aircraft have been recommissioned in the ongoing conflict by both sides. [There have been more than 40 aircraft lost by all sides since 2012 in Libya (select Type: aviation).](https://lostarmour.info/libya/) 

Haftar's key backers are Egypt, United Arab Emirates, Saudi-Arabia. France also backs him. Russia is important mostly for UNSC cover, but other than that less important for Marshal Haftar.  

In Venezuela, there are no Russian bombers in Venezuela right now. Every five years Tu-160 long range strategic bombers visit Venezuela as part of training and bilateral cooperation between the militaries, they were in Venezuela in 2018, 2013 and 2008. Any Russian soldiers who are in Venezuela are there in order to train and cooperate with the Venezuelan army, which is a big customer of Rosboronexport, look at its equipment on Wikipedia, almost everything from Russia. Somebody has to train the Venezuelans how to use it. 

The claim that Maduro was about to flee Venezuela is completely unproven and most likely a lie. Trump's government has taken a page out of the Hillary Clinton playbook – if you lose, the coup failed, blame Russia. Remember all the fake stories from the early phase of the Syrian crisis, eaten up willingly by allegedly credible media. Dozens of times there were claims about Bashar al-Assad and his family being on a plane to Russia or the UAE, him living on a Russian military ship off the Syrian coast and so on.

Okay, are you aware that EU is more then just Germany? Also worth mentioning that ""federal EU"" wasnt much of a talk when most members joined so its hard to expect everyone to be excited for that. 

&gt;Tusk is in his position against the will of the polish majority (aka the party voted by the majority). This alone shows that the pro-eu claims are nothing but hypocritical.

First of all, 17% of Polish population voted for PiS, 37,6% of votes. A lot of people voted PiS only because they were tired of PO, not because they are anti eu. The only reason why PiS have majority is because of the stupid way ""wasted"" votes are awarded, where fat gets fatter, so it ended up like it ended, AGAINST the will of the nation.

Another point, you can believe that pis is anti eu but thats a lie and they didnt get votes in 2015 because they were against eu (as such, people didnt vote for ""anti eu"" party).

And my last point, PO rulled Poland for 8 years, did everything that EU asked them to do, so saying that Poland was always ""anti EU"" is simply put retarded, especially that there is nothing to back it up (and no, being against forced ""refugees"" quota isnt being ""anti EU"" or shows lack of ""europeans values"").",,/r/europe/comments/bldpsm/woman_arrested_in_poland_over_posters_of_virgin/emracmf/,wofoo,1557251159

The 3,000 number comes from Gustav Henningsen and Jaime Contreras in 1986, who studied the total number of sentences from 1560 to 1700 and found that 1,9% of the accused were executed. 

The problem, as other parts of the article say, is that it's difficult to find out the total number of sentences (records before 1560 are poor and sometimes only a few regions' records are preserved) and the percentage of executions is not uniform; Inquisition courts in Valencia, for example, were more active and had more people executed between 1480 and 1530 than in other periods.

1784,"&gt; If Ukrainian authorities call Donbass citizens ""traitors"", ""scums"" then all your arguments moot

Yes, passions tend to run quite hot in wartime. But the citizens living in unoccupied Donbass aren’t repressed, they enjoy the same rights all other Ukrainians enjoy. The areas held by the “separatists” are, by all accounts, much more authoritarian and repressive. You want to make it sound like the Ukrainian government has a violent hatred of everyone living in these two oblasts, but that’s not true.

&gt; where Russian soldiers POW ?

There have been several. Don’t you remember the reports about the Russian soldiers being captured and Russia then trying to disown them, despite the soldiers’ own pleas?

&gt; no ""ultranationalist"" (they don't have anyone with nationalist background in DNR/LNR government)

So was it just a joke when Denis Pushilin, the current DNR “President”, literally said they want to join a reborn Russian Empire?

&gt; 90% of police officers are same as before 2014

They’re police officers, tied to the local community. They generally don’t up and leave whenever there’s a change of government. And the elected governments of the region were overthrown. The elected (and pro-Russian!) mayor of Donetsk had to flee the city because he didn’t support the separatists’ use of force.

&gt; that referendum fully in line with any exit-polls

Bullcrap. Polling at the time showed only 30% of people in Donetsk backed a union with Russia.

The referendum was actually “fully in line” with numbers that Ukrainian intelligence had leaked six days earlier based on a phone call between separatist leaders and Russian neo-Nazis (again, no nationalism here!), where the latter advised the separatists to set 89% as their “yes” vote. That’s the exact result that wound up occurring.

1888,"**Paywall:**

Turkey greets you with a chilly blue eye, a flared eyebrow, a cliff-like cheekbone. The face of the republic’s founder glares imperious from almost every office wall, shopkeeper’s kiosk and airport terminal.

Turkish citizens regard Mustafa Kemal reverentially: the nation’s first president, courageous leader of the 1919–1922 war of independence, deliverer from the great powers’ imperial cleaver. An impenetrable cultish mythos envelops him. Even for Istanbul’s young cosmopolitans, any word against Kemal spurs a visceral reaction.Recep Erdogan, the current president, whose politics are anathema to Kemalist ideology, still has to invoke him for the purposes of propaganda. To an American intelligence officer who met the man in the fraught summer of 1921, however, Kemal was a  ‘clever, ugly customer,’ with the look of ‘a very superior waiter’.

It’s little wonder that an American would view Kemal in such a way. His nationalist movement was waging a quasi-guerrilla insurgency against the victors of the first world war, who sought to carve up the moribund, defeated Ottoman empire. In the process, Kemal completed what his predecessors had already begun: the definitive slaughter and removal of the empire’s remaining Christian population: Pontic and Ionian Greeks, Assyrians and, of course, Armenians.

In their expansive and detailed new volume The Thirty-Year Genocide the historians Benny Morris and Dror Ze’evi depart from well-established accounts of the Armenian genocide which often consign earlier and later frenzies of slaying to introductions and conclusions. They roll three crimes into one. First, the Hamidian Terror (1894–96) under the sclerotic rule of Sultan Abdülhamid II. Secondly, the obliteration carried out by the formerly liberal Committee of Union and Progress (1914–18). And finally, the Kemalist ‘cleansing’ campaigns during and after the war of independence (1919–24).

Morris and Ze’evi document each period well, if often gruellingly. They include a distressing but accurate summary:

*An Armenian woman from eastern Anatolia, born in the 1880s, would likely have seen her parents killed in 1895 and her husband and son massacred in 1915. If she survived, she probably would have been raped and murdered in 1919–1924. Certainly she would have been deported in that last genocidal phase.*

They are right to draw a link between all three in the sense that, no matter the ideological motive, the result was the same: a complete eradication of ethnic and religious minorities, leading to a death toll that approaches two million. But it is the ideological motives that the authors encounter trouble with. To their credit, they admit that ‘the bouts of atrocity were committed under three different ideological umbrellas’. Yet for their thesis to work, there must be unity of purpose. And they’ve picked the wrong one.

They find an ‘overarching… banner’ in Islam, which, they say, ‘played a cardinal role throughout the process’. Partly, their misreading is down to relying extensively on the accounts of Allied officers or western missionaries quick to attribute bouts of savagery to ‘fanatical Mohammedanism’. This skips over the fact that ‘Christians lived in relative security under Ottoman rule for centuries’. What changed?

The only theory that could explain all three fits of carnage is this: a siege mentality. Abdülhamid II, the Committee of Union and Progress and Mustafa Kemal (also a CUP member) were all gripped by a fear of the state’s disfigurement and collapse, and they directed apocalyptic violence against those they perceived as traitors or fifth columnists.

Indeed, only this could explain something Morris and Ze’evi consign to a desultory footnote: the Turkish republic’s 94-year-long campaign against the Kurds. They are Muslim, too, by majority, but from 1925 engaged in rebellions and resistances against the state — and have suffered dearly for it. In a way, paranoia about partition is the galvanising politics of the Turkish elite to this day.

The authors also withdraw from a bitterly ironic point made by pioneering writers such as Taner Akçam, Ugur Üngör, and Hrant Dink, a very confronting and uncomfortable idea indeed: contrary to the miraculous or messianic view of Mustafa Kemal, there would not be a Turkish nation without the destruction of its Christian peoples.

1893,"Transalted article:

&gt; **The Polish economy will grow faster this year than the European Commission expected in February. The spring forecasts published in Brussels show that Poland's GDP will reach 4.2 per cent, which is 0.7 per cent more than in the winter forecasts and gives Poland the second place in the EU after Malta. Next year the Commission forecasts a decline and a GDP of 3.6 per cent, but this will continue to be the second result in the Community.**

&gt; According to winter forecasts, Ireland, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania and Slovakia were expected to record better economic growth than Poland. Now, after corrections, the Commission estimates that the Polish economy will accelerate.

&gt; In the analysis of our country, EU experts wrote that growth will be driven primarily by private consumption, supported by wage increases.

&gt; ""Greater social benefits will be an additional stimulus for about half of next year."" - we read in the document.

&gt; The Commission's latest economic forecasts also include data on the increase in the public finance deficit. As far as Poland is concerned, last year it was at the lowest level in years - 0.4% of GDP. This year, it is expected to grow to 1.6% of GDP. This is linked to a significant increase in social benefits, as the Commission's experts have written. It is the 13th pension and the payment of PLN 500 for the first child. Assuming that the situation remains unchanged, the Commission forecasts that the deficit will fall slightly to 1.4% of GDP next year.

&gt; ""Spectacular results.""

&gt; The European Commissioner for Economic Affairs, Pierre Moscovici, considered Poland's performance spectacular. He admitted that already last year's economic growth in Poland surprised analysts.

&gt; ""The excellent export results in the last quarter of 2018 paved the way for further growth, which will be supported by Poland's strong international competitiveness and export market share. Another thing that has contributed to better results is the increase in social benefits for pensioners and families with young children, and this stimulus will contribute to greater domestic demand."" - mentioned the EU Commissioner. He added that all these factors had led the Commission to revise its winter economic forecasts and the spring forecasts are more optimistic.

&gt; **Forecasts for the euro area downwards**

&gt; The European Commission has slightly lowered its economic forecast for the euro area. According to its estimates, the eurozone economy will slow down slightly and will grow at a rate of 1.3% this year. This is 0.1pps less than the Commission's experts estimated in winter. Next year the euro zone economy is expected to grow by 1.5 per cent.

&gt; The Commission wrote that the reason for the slowdown in economic growth is the weakening of world trade. However, it stressed that the situation on the labour market had improved considerably and estimated that employment would continue to grow. She added that domestic demand would be stable and wages would rise.

1896,"Solar panels or thermal, they both capture energy from sunlight, which is going to increase only marginally and only in Southern Europe because of (again) a slight projected decrease in cloud cover. Ergo, energy production per square kilometre isn't increasing as much as you might imagine.

Let's do the maths.

Spanish agriculture consumes today [25.47 × 10^9 m^3/year](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/9/12/964/pdf) of fresh water.

Desalinating one cubic meter of water *ideally* takes [0.833 kWh](https://www.quora.com/How-much-energy-is-required-for-water-desalination). 

In practice, the number is significantly higher because of inefficiency. Moreover, the ideal number doesn't factor pumping water in and brine out, inefficiency, and other incidental energy usage. Let's say 3 kWh per cubic metre.

```25.47*10^9*2 =  76,410,000,000 kWh =  76.41 TWh``` 
only used to desalinate water for agriculture.

According to Wikipedia, Spain produces [276.8 TWh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_in_Spain) today. 31% of this comes from non-renewables, i.e. 85.808 TWh.

So, Spain should increase its renewable production by: 
```85.808 TWh + 76.41 TWh =  162.218 TWh```
only using renewables.

Wikipedia says that the largest solar thermal power plant produces 370 MW of power, ergo such a power plant working 24 hours a day (molten salts and all that) produces:

```370 MW * 24h * 365 days =  3.161280 TWh```

You will need to build more than 51 such monster stations just to break even.

* This calculation does not factor in the environmental impact of desalination (brine disposal) which is not insignificant. Also, maintenance costs: filter replacement etc.",Italy,/r/europe/comments/blbh1o/comparing_the_latitude_of_europe_and_north_america/emqyeom/,ilpescepalla,1557244569

1908,"I think you're misunderstanding what you're hearing, frankly. First of all, whether they're called ""English"" or ""British"" or not, the statement has plenty of validity - almost all protestants in Ireland are of British heritage, aside from a tiny minority of converts. Secondly, the British state explicitly privileged protestants until 1922 in the Republic, and to this day in Northern Ireland, so the correlation between ""British"" and ""Protestant"" is strong. Segregation goes right back to the plantations, and the only part of the island where it's dissipated is the Republic. Thirdly, you probably don't know this, but many of the Irish cultural revivalists and nationalist heroes were protestants, going back centuries. Lord Edward Fitzgerald, Theobald Wolfe Tone, Charles Stewart Parnell and W.B Yeats are just some examples of the most venerated figures in Irish history. Sectarian discrimination mainly went one way, and that was against Catholics in areas the British controlled. You could be a protestant and be a volunteer in the IRA, but you couldn't be a Catholic and join the orange order, or any of it's associated paramilitary entities. The Irish state *specifically* gave protestants unique rights to discriminate on faith grounds, while Catholics were being stripped of their civil rights in Northern Ireland. The idea that the there are ""two sides"" to this is frankly ahistorical nonsense.

Incidentally, while it's only semi-related, it's worth pointing out that the Spanish crown and the Catholic Church both strongly and repeatedly condemned and forbade mistreatments of American natives - from torture to forced labour (as early as 1504 iirc, and later reaffirmed - see [Sublimis Deus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublimis_Deus), the [New Laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Laws), and the [Valladolid debate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valladolid_debate)).

1965,"&gt; the people DID NOT back down in the face of violent supression.  
  
I never said people should back down. Resistance can be peaceful. They can refuse to work, or to obey the government, but *passively*, not *actively*. They shouldn't back down, but ""not backing down"" does not necessarily imply ""punching back"".  
  
&gt; You seem to know what SHOULDN'T be done, but don't really give any alternatives.  
  
Frankly: prevention. Acting correctly to preserve democracy *while it's still there*.  
Once it's no longer there, apart from massive, passive disobeying like I mentioned earlier (which would be the safest bet), there isn't much of a good solution. When you're fucked, you're fucked and, if I had the solution to removing dictatorship without making things worse, I would be out there, liberating all the dictatorships in the world.  
But my lack of a universal solution is not an argument. I also don't know how to remove a brain tumour, but I know that smashing it with a hammer is not the way to go, which is why I would be comfortable arguing with someone who suggests that even after they ask me ""yeah? well what would YOU suggest?"" and I have no answer to give them.

The reality for the Turks in Turkey is different however:  
\* Prices for meat are INSANE. People have gone full vegetarian because they can not afford meat anymore.  
\* Erdogan has effectively pillaged and destroyed farmers to the point that farmers are littering their harvest on the streets because their harvest can not sustain their already minimalist, poverty-ridden life.  
\* Erdogan has DESTROYED the hazelnut farmers who are struggling to survive while mega-corporations are raking in record profits by paying farmers less and less. Farmers are trying to increase their harvest size but inadvertedly flood the market with more hazelnuts and lowering the value even further.  
\* There are 5 times more teachers of religion than of math, chemistry, biology or any other science. Teachers of sciences are literally unemployed because the curriculum is cutting down on science.  
\* RECORD UNEMPLOYMENT for those that have fought long and hard on getting a degree. University grads are resorting to doing menial jobs or are turning to vices to sustain their miserable life.  
\* Rampart DRUG EPIDEMIC called Bonsai going on for AGES. The youth is literally killing themselves and their future on the streets.  
\* Retired people can not even live with their retirement funds and are killing themselves to  
\* People put have unpaid tabs on fucking grocery stores and the owners have entire books dedicated to debt-keeping. They know that most of them won't be able to pay it back but they know they can't let them starve either.  
\* Meanwhile Erdogan has built GOLD CHAIRS AND GOLD THRONES in his own presidential palace with funds he embezelled from the people.  
\* Nepotism in the government is RAMPANT. People without even high school diplomas can hold key positions in the economy and in the government, provided you are some kind of ally with the AKP. Those that do have a university degree have committed plagiarism on their thesis.

Just go take a logic class or something, so that at least you don't get lost in your own reasoning. Also, you should learn that repeatedly stating your opinion does not make it magically true, and neither does it make you appear more persuasive.

Then Sawsan Chebli, a Berlin politician and state secretary, got banned from Twitter after talking about an AfD election ad and people were quick to accuse her and the social democrats of hypocracy, pointing out laws like the infamous NetzDG and the much feared uploadfilters.

2156,"Depends on how you define war. By UN definition, ""A war of aggression is a series of acts committed with a sustained intent ""

And The 1933 The Convention for the Definition of Aggression, defined aggression as follows:

* Declaration of war upon another State.

(Russia did not declare war, but then again neither did Germany in 1941 and it does not mean it wasn't a war)

* Invasion by its armed forces, with or without a declaration of war, of the territory of another State.
* Attack by its land, naval or air forces, with or without a declaration of war, on the territory, vessels or aircraft of another State.

Ukrainian armed camps were surrounded and disarmed. I am pretty sure that is an attack.

* Naval blockade of the coasts or ports of another State.
* Provision of support to armed bands formed in its territory which have invaded the territory of another State, or refusal, notwithstanding the request of the invaded State, to take, in its own territory, all the measures in its power to deprive those bands of all assistance or protection.

Armed conflict did not take place, but the invasion of Crimea, I think, can be categorized as war of aggression.

2186,"&gt; How do you feel about your government track record concerning the construction of renewables energy sources and the necessary energy grid update ? Have there been massive locale opposition to those projects ?

Sometimes there is local opposition to wind farm projects, but in many cases where local people can buy a share of the project, opposition is negligible. It also depends on where you are. In Copenhagen there is zero opposition to planned wind farms in Øresund, while there is more opposition in coastal areas in other parts of the country.

The debate on power lines is quite insignificant. There was a bit opposition to a new transmission line to Germany because it was planned as overhead lines while we for decades have been putting existing transmission lines in the ground. There has also been a bit opposition to a transmission line to the UK, mainly because the business case is weak.

War breaks out on a global scale, everybody starts shooting and almost everybody dies. That would mean a rise in enviromental damage to it's actual max potential, since all the weapons will be used up. If everybody is dead, then ofc climate does not matter anymore.

A secondary scenario would be that war breaks out slowly and becomes bigger. Every power starts a race to arm itself to the teeth. Best example could be Germany before and during WW2. Almost every nation's industry was shut down or shrunk to the minimum so the ressources could be used to create war potential. I don't think in this phase anybody would give a duck about the enviroment. Full power production, bringing more enviromental damage and maybe followed by war, adding also the damage done by the use of weaponry, not only it's creation.

I don't see how someone could think war would bring enviromental health back. War alone would worsen it, before there even would be a chance for recuperation.",,/r/europe/comments/bl8lam/chart_armenia_is_the_worlds_angriest_country/emq4lky/,DataPigeon,1557223128

Its VVER 440/V-213+ reactor. Its current generation modification of V-213 series, the only one in existence that was modified to not just pass all safety checks and stress tests of IAEA and WENRA, but also any possible additions in the future. From safety perspective, these reactors are overkill, designed to handle one in hundred thousand years natural catastrophe like 9 Richer scale earthquake that has been recorded in this region exactly never.

The previous generation handled scale 8 in Armenia couple years back without breaking any safety features FYI.

So now they argue with utter non-senses like ""the coating has been drilled to"".

Which is true. It was drilled inside in order to attach additional tons of metal exoskeleton in order to handle  1 in 100 000 years Earthquake, increasing its safety. They won't mention this ""detail"" however.

Or saying how it could leak radioactive water in case that Airbus 380 hits it in full speed from impossible angle. Directly, flat-out, to reactor chamber. Ignoring that A, that is why we have at every time per NATO directive two armed and ready to flight fighter jets at Sliac air force base that are fully armed and B, chance of leakage in such impossible event is 1 in 10x5 and C, for that reason, there are installed underground filters directly below the reactor chamber which would in such event filter the water to the radioactivity level of thermal spas in Turcianske Teplice.

And D, the eco-friendly Austrians have massive OMV refinery right next to Danube in Schwechat, directly next to largest international airport in the region, making it much more likely target than NPP which is also protected by anti-aircraft brigade in nearby Nitra that is equipped with S-300PMU with over-the-horizon radar. If such refinery would ever to be hit by airplane, the explosion could total entire village and leak would destroy any and all biotope from there all the way to Black sea and permanently damage Danube and its fauna.

The status of the Alsaciens in the German Empire, that of second class citizen in a second class Land, is also quite explicite in the consideration of ""Germans"" toward Alsace.

There are many situations where you cannot prevent an accident (car decides to turn right - right into you) and a helmet is the difference between a minor concussion and a bloody mess on the street.

2327,"""The Spanish Ministry of Defense has given an award to a book that analyzes how cinema and Anglo-Saxon series ridicule the history of Spain

Arriving at the top of the hill, Theodore Roosevelt - Medal of Honor of the United States Congress and future North American president - ""shot the Spaniards who were retreating, seeing one fall, and although he was not sure that he had killed him, He boasted: 'I killed a Spaniard with my own hand like a hare. ""The fact remains that 700 Spaniards had withstood the US attack of some 15,000 men on the hill of San Juan (Cuba) for 11 hours and that they lacked of the fearsome Maxim machine guns, Roosevelt arrived, moreover, when the Buffalo Soldiers - African-American military - had won the hill and there were only machine-gunned bodies, however, in Hollywood productions such as Rough Riders (1997) or Night in the Museum (2006). ), Roosevelt is described as a hero who liberates oppressed peoples and deserves a distinction.This and other stories about the black legend are told in The Image of the Presence of Spain in America ( 1492-1898) in British and American cinema, now awarded by the Ministry of Defense headed by Margarita Robles.

The captain and historian Esteban Vicente Boisseau tells in his work how the black legend has been transposed to the Anglo cinema and, for geopolitical reasons, incorporates stereotypes against Spain. ""Without a doubt, the African-American population would consider inadmissible that in the Disney parks there would be an attraction, set to the sound of a happy music, showing Africans captured by pirates."" ""The message conveyed in Pirates of the Caribbean is that stealing, torturing and killing Spaniards, selling, buying and abusing Hispanic women and looting is not only justified, it is a joyful event, an authentic diversion,"" says Boisseau.

In the movie 1492: the conquest of Paradise (1992) shows a grim Castile that never ceases to execute heretics. Given that the Spanish Inquisition killed some 3,000 people in three centuries, it would be expected that, since Henry VIII murdered more than 50,000 Catholics, films about his reign showed continuous executions. But no.

Years later, Felipe II decided to invade England by the continuous attack of the corsairs, the execution of Maria Estuardo and the persecutions against the English catholics. He organized a large armada that in 1588, after a meeting with the English fleet, ended up capsizing in a storm. Professor María José Rodríguez Salgado also revealed that ""no Spanish ship was lost as a result of the combat"". In the British film Elizabeth: the Golden Age, Walter Raleigh is shown directing an English ship in flames against the Spanish fleet, causing the gigantic explosion of numerous Spanish naos, although the reality is that the navy sank several days later for the temporary.

Hollywood films enhance the image of the Anglo-Saxon colonization of North America without reflecting its Spanish past. It shows the passage of the Spanish as a memory that left no trace. In Dancing with Wolves (1990), the protagonist, a lieutenant of the Union, makes friends with a Sioux tribe in which an old man teaches the helmet of a conqueror saying that those who brought him arrived in the grandfather's era of his grandfather , and that over time they were thrown out, giving the impression that for two centuries there had not been a continued Spanish presence in California, Florida, New Mexico or Texas.

    The black Spanish legend that has spread Hollywood

    To the rescue of the last ones of the Philippines

The captain and historian Esteban Vicente Boisseau tells in his work how the black legend has been transposed to the Anglo cinema and, for geopolitical reasons, incorporates stereotypes against Spain. ""Without a doubt, the African-American population would consider inadmissible that in the Disney parks there would be an attraction, set to the sound of a happy music, showing Africans captured by pirates.""

In Dancing with Wolves (1990), the protagonist, a lieutenant of the Union, makes friends with a Sioux tribe in which an old man teaches the helmet of a conqueror saying that those who brought him arrived in the grandfather's era of his grandfather , and that over time they were thrown out, giving the impression that for two centuries there had not been a continued Spanish presence in California, Florida, New Mexico or Texas.

The deed of Francisco Pizarro conquering with less than 170 men the Inca Empire is undermined highlighted that was a traitor for killing Atahualpa, as in the British film The Royal Hunting of the Sun. On the contrary, the English and Anglo-Americans do not delve into how they betrayed, between 1787 and 1871, 389 treaties signed with the Indians, practicing methods of ethnic cleansing.

The films never do justice to the protective role of the Spanish rulers, who introduced improvements in America and put an end to human sacrifice and cannibalism. The monarchs Isabel I, Carlos I and Felipe II developed a network of hospitals and universities that benefited everyone, whether Spanish or native. The Government of the United States did not recognize citizenship for all Indians until 1924, four centuries later.

Shortly after his arrival in Virginia in 1607, the English settlers committed crimes against the Indians. Although Captain John Smith stood out for his cruelty, he appears as a kind and kind character in Pocahontas (1995). The American professor Theodore Jojola, of Indian origin, commented that ""the English governor Ratcliffe is transformed [by Hollywood] into a Spanish conqueror eager for gold"".

These images have been used with a ""political purpose"" to justify the struggle against Spain for hegemony in the Americas. Once hostilities began in Cuba, films emerged justifying their invasion. The power of the misrepresentation, with the film Rough Riders (1997), has had enough weight so that, more than a century after that war, ""it was granted to the clumsy colonel of volunteers and then president of the United States Theodore Roosevelt a Medal of Honor of the Congress that the own American military commanders of the time considered that it did not deserve "", explains Vicente Boisseau. He killed a fleeing soldier in the back and whose detachment had 20 times fewer men than the attacker.


The first war film in history was anti-Spanish

Two friends, the Americans J. Stuart Blackton and Albert E. Smith, filmed the one that is considered the first war film in history in 1897. It was called Tearing Down the Spanish Flag (Tearing down the Spanish flag) and showed the lowered of the badge national as it was hoisted the US over the castle of the Morro of the port of Havana.

It obtained a great success, as well as its sequel of 1899, Raising Old Glory Over Morro Castle (Lifting the old glory on the castle of the Morro). The Phonoscope magazine made the criticism: ""The Spanish flag lowers, and upwards floats the one of bars and the stars. The symbol of tyranny and oppression that has ruled the new world for four hundred years collapses, and the banner of freedom rises. In the distance are the towers and battlements of Morro, the last fortress of Spain in America.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare_state#Germany

&gt;Otto von Bismarck, the powerful Chancellor of Germany (in office 1871–90), **developed the first modern welfare state by building on a tradition of welfare programs in Prussia and Saxony that had begun as early as in the 1840s**. The measures that Bismarck introduced – old-age pensions, accident insurance, and employee health insurance – **formed the basis of the modern European welfare state**

... 

&gt;His paternalistic programs **aimed to forestall social unrest and to undercut the appeal of the Social Democratic Party, and to secure the support of the working classes for the German Empire**, as well as to reduce emigration to the United States, where wages were higher but welfare did not exist.

...

What you call ""semantics"" is actually the whole substance of it: 

Bismarck did indeed introduce the welfare *state* as we know it today. But the reason the Social Democrats and the Socialists opposed him wasn't that they didn't want welfare - in fact, quite the opposite. They wanted to preserve the welfare system that had been in place in Germany since the late middle ages, which was run by guilds, trade associations and, more recently, the German unions.

The reason they opposed Bismarck's social legislation was that they didn't want all that to be seized *by state power*; they wanted those union welfare systems expanded to industry workers (which weren't covered by the legacy welfare systems, only artisans and farmers were). 

Incidentally, the capitalists themselves opposed him on that as well. Some, like Krupp, because they had their own corporate welfare schemes and didn't want to see it taken over by Prussian bureaucrats; others because they didn't want to pay for any kind of welfare at all.

Yet, all these countries still have a rule of law and enough functioning police (and even better secret police) combined with one of the strictest laws against any kind of wepon or explosive materials that no huge terrorist attack with very numerous cassualties can happen; Further more, eastern european countries have more religious societies and while that comes with it's share of problems it also means it's way harder to become radicalised in a completely different culture without attracting any attention;

2500,"&gt; Does it mean Islam has a say in German criminal law?

Courts will generally then call religious experts as witnesses, whether or not the Quran holds such a status is a question in which it is perfectly possible to determine material-objective truth. That writing ""The Quran, the holy Quran"" on toilet paper and sending that to Mosques and TV stations was intended to defame and disturb the public peace is also not really in question, and that was before the guy started to rant in court. No wonder he got the book thrown at him.

Now, if a Zen master did the toilet paper thing with their own doctrine of iconoclasting their own guidelines we'd have a much different case, also if someone pissed on a Buddha with the intent to defame, but doctrinal failure to do so. How those cases would be decided is the actually interesting question.

Oh, and as you mentioned it: There's actually one area in which German law defers to Islamic law -- not in criminal matters, but civil, to precise family law. There was e.g a case in which a woman demanded alimony from her ex-husband, who argued that he did not need to pay a cent as she was his second wife, and thus never his wife under German law. Courts said: Nah, you got married abroad by the laws in force there, those laws don't contradict our constitution, thus they apply to your relationship. Pay up.

2619,"&gt; I wonder what the german criminal law doctrine has to say on this subject.

While not laicistic, Germany is a secular state. Public-law churches and world-view organisations have their privileges, heck they write their own employment laws (still has to stick to the constitution, of course) but they don't get any statutory say in criminal law, and also not in its interpretation. Differently put: German legal doctrine doesn't bow to religion, it bows to the values of enlightenment. This ""human dignity"" that modern German law is based on is not Christian, it is very much Kantian. Quoting philosophical discourses will get you way further than bible-thumping.

They get to say that Mary is a religious figure of respect, not what insulting her constitutes, but they do get to say what *not* insulting her constitutes (E.g. Buddhists will readily testify that pissing on Buddha statutes is not an un-Buddhist thing to do, so how could it be insulting of the creed, even if it insults the figure).

Firstly, rainbow isn't insulting, it's the symbol of tolerance. Secondly, there was no intent to ""hurt religious feelings"" - you cannot want to defame something by setting it together with a symbol that you identify with.

There were similar cases already (but in relation to the polish flag and coat of arms) and no one was convicted. Of course it's a joke that said law exists and that people are being dragged to courts, but in cases like this it never ends in convictions.

2840,"&gt;But weren't German numbers irrelevant because the Model 3 was new here, and it would naturally be at the top?

No, I was speaking about German market all the time, stop trying to be wilfully ignorant, it doesn't win any arguments. I dismissed the Model 3 numbers in Germany, not German numbers in general. And I dismissed the Model 3 numbers because it's new (in Germany), its sales numbers are volatile and it's hard to predict its long-term popularity as the novelty wears off. It might become a regular EV in time if the sales will stay at the current level, or it will remain a novelty (and therefore not a ""regular EV"") if they fall.

&gt;So there's just no data that could convince you that the Model 3 is a regular EV?

There is, and that's the percentage of Model 3 registrations as the percentage of total EV registrations (in Germany).

2847,"&gt;He is being treated poorly by the police because he is a criminal.

Do criminals not have rights? Is it ok to harass them? To attack them on the streets?

&gt; Ok, when Stephen Yaxley-Lennon a) becomes a politician and b) gets egged, he will have the same legal protection afforded to him as his fellow victim, Jeremy Corbyn.

a) He is a politician (however weird that might sound) - he is professionally involved in politics and is running in elections. Either way, that is irrelevant unless you can show me in the UK law where there is a distinction that doing something like that to a politician and to a non politician is treated drastically differently. 

b) You said it yourself: "" It is a long held practice that politicians get (mostly) harmless stuff thrown at them."" An egg and a milkshake are harmless, yet in one case its assault in another its a free police (taxi) ride. Stop pretending this has any basis in the law, its a clear double standard.

&gt; I read the interview the milkshake-throwing agitator gave in the Guardian. He explained how he found himself opposite a racist.

2865,"&gt; Kellerman, Kebler etc....spoke french, as well as most of the nobility etc...true they spoke Alsacien as well, but most edict where already in french even before the Revolution. bref you're spewing non sense.

This is besides the point. When Alsace‐Lorraine became part of Germany only about 15% of the population spoke French as a mother tongue. That is not a lot and most of it is due a certain part being annexed purely for strategical reason, so it's actually even lower.
&gt; This is completly false. Ernst Moritz Arndt want a word with you. Especially considering Prussia tried to forced High-German on Alsaciens. 

I'm not saying the situation was perfect by any means, just that it was much, much better than in France.
&gt; Nowadays 32% of inhabitant of Alsace speak Alsacien, they have school to teach and bilingual publication. What annihilation are you talking about ?

It took forever to even reach that point. Only about 5% of children speak German these days and it's because of France's actions. Even before WW II the autonomy movement was harshly repressed.

The politics after WW II were so harsh, less than half the population born after 1970 has German as a mother tongue. In only a few decades!

Why should I stop informing people how miserable it is to find rentals in sweden?. What is it that makes you so nervous about it?.

You can speak about Spain but I can't say a thing how miserable it is the rental market in sweden?.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Again, what is your agenda. 

Why do you scandinavians see only agendas when someone criticize your countries?. isnt' that a cheap way to silence people?.

In denmark it's the same story absolute misery to find rentals and in iceland the same. Why is it that you make it so difficult for people to live in your country?.

&amp;#x200B;

In Spain we don't have such restrictive rental market but you come here like an expert talking about my country when most likely you haven't been there.

I lived in sweden and I know most nordic countries are very restrictive to rentals. Then why is it like that?.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Again, what is your agenda. I haven't attacked Spain at all. It's great that you can find a place easily there. I'm not Swedish but I know that it's difficult to find a place in Stockholm. It's not in Malmö. A lot of Copenhageners go there to find cheaper accomodation. 

Again you keep lying!. The lack of rentals in sweden is EVERYWHERE!. Malmö right now has a queue of 5 years in average for first hand!. 

Why are you scandinavians so manipulative?. Why not just accept your housing system is misery and a trap?.

3266,"As usual, you come here to spread your lies, furthering your independentist stances. It is obvious you know better, as the cataln hymn is based on the events surrounding on the catalan revolt.

For all the others:

Spain and France were fighting the 30 years war on opposing sides in central and northern Europe. France decided to take the war to Spain (called the ""war by diversion""), giving aid to separatist movements inside Spain, where dissent was growing as Spain was losing important (though not decisive) battles in the Netherlands to France. The growing dissent, with french aid, encouraged these movements to openly revolt.

But why was there dissent in Catalonia in the first place? First of all, because catalans were being pressed into military service, together with castillians, which were being stationed in larger numbers in Catalonia (to fend off a possible attack). Also, the crown was spreading the tax pressure from Castille - which always bore the highest tax pressure in the empire - more evenly to other realms.

After initially declaring a republic under the protection of France (17th of January 1641), the King of France was made Count of Barcelona on the 21st of January 1641. With the spanish army marching on Barcelona defeated by the rebels at the Battle of Montjuïc in 1641, France took advantage and invaded the Roussillon, aided by the local rebels. After a 10 month siege, Perpignan fell in september 1642 to the french and the rebels.

The peasant rebels not only turned against the habsburg, but also agains the local nobility. These demanded the french to support them crush the rebellion, which they did. With the french controlling Catalonia directly with their own army, or indirectly through the rebels for a decade, the french raised taxes in Catalonia and pressed men into service against the neighbouring kingdoms of Aragón and Valencia. Nonetheless, there was no success for the catalan-french army, as the sieges against the neighbouring fortresses did not lead to the desired victories, and this lead to the catalans becoming unhappy again.

In the meantime, the 30 years war ended, and though the french pretty much won, they had a civil war (which the crown won), but which had exhausted them. The spanish were also tied down with the portuguese revolting, a revolt of natives in Chile, but the armies in the Netherlands, which had a strength of their own, took on the french again in the north. In the meantime, the french and spanish also clashed in Italy, where both held important stretches of lands, as well as extensive webs of alliances of local states and rulers.

So, despite everyone being battle weary, the catalans were so unhappy with their new overlords, that they switched sides, AGAIN, and eventually the spanish crown retook all of Catalonia south of the pyrenees, with little to no resistance from the french, who decided it was more important to repel the attacks in the north. So by 1652 Barcelona was again in hands of the spanish crown. Although Spain pushed north into Perpignan, that area was in firm hands of France, and the Pyrenees formed a formidable natural barrier that could not be decisively vanquished with depleted forces.

So what happens then? The English declare was on Spain in 1654. This is important because there was a stalemate in Italy, there was movement, but in no decisive direction in the netherlands, and a stalemate in Catalonia. The English then came down on the spanish netherlands, which upset the balance of power in favour of the anglo/french alliance, culminating in the anglo/french victory at the Battle of the Dunes in 1658. Oh yeah, and the war with Portugal is still ongoing.

So, in 1659, Spain sues for peace against France, which leads to Rousillon staying in french hands.

Here you can read about and have the links to relevant battles where you can check the dates yourself.

So with all that in mind, I ask you, the reader, to reconsider if ""Spain gave away [the Rousillon] to France"", or if there was a bloody war going on pretty much everywhere, with Spain standing alone against several other european powers, and that it had no choice but to accept the fait accompli, that the Rousillon was in the firm grasp of France, with no chance of taking it back.

From my point of view, the catalans are pretty damn well responsible for the break away of the Roussillon: By rebelling and switching sides, declaring for a foreign power, they have themselves to blame that the new border was drawn through their own territory, specially when they helped the invader take Perpignan in the first place.",European Union,/r/europe/comments/bkvja9/minority_languages_in_france/emmzeqd/,reaqtion,1557143219

So did I.

&gt;How fuckin stupid are you? 

I had this very reaction to your post, frankly.

&gt;Vilnius was built by Lithuanians. Belonged to Lithuanians. 

Lithuanians (Grand Duchy of Lithuania inhabitants). Of which Lithuanians (Baltic-speaking) were only a subset of, and not even the biggest one.

&gt;Population of the city means nothing

Not according to city's inhabitants at the time. It's verry funny when the population of your supposed ""capital"" don't want to hear about being a part of your country.

&gt;
Which was never. 

Which was during the interwar period, when the city was an integral part of Poland, regardless of whatever delusions Lithuanians (Baltic-speaking) in their little Republic of Lithuania with a capital in Kaunas might have had.

&gt;
You don't understand what you're talking about.

Says the guy whose entire argument is based on a delusional fantasy.

&gt;Completely unrelated and non comparable. The history and demographics of those cities and relations between Poland and Lithuania vs Poland and Prussia are not similar in any way imaginable. 

Surely you are aware that in both cases people living in those cities staged an uprising against the German army.

&gt;
Lol you're delusional. Typical imperialistic excuses.

Whatever helps you sleep at night.

&gt;hahaha. It cancels out???? HAHAHA. That's how the world works in your fantasy land? LOL

Maybe in your fantasy land being the second to last to briefly control a city that has changed hands a dozen of times in an all-out warfare period gives you a pernament claim to it, but outside your delusions nobody cares.

&gt; If you can argue with me with nothing but nonsense

My arguments are logical, and based on cold facts. Yours are based on delusions and magical thinking, so it figures you think you can see what will happen in the future.

3370,"I think I know what happenend. I just don't know what this phenomenon is called, and I haven't seen much of it in the West for it to have a common name. 

Basically, a lot of people in Russia and Eastern Europe just look at responsibilities and education as a formality. 

Just go, just apply to college, just scrape by, just put a signature, just get your degree, if you can cheat - cheat, go to work interviews, lie, someone will take you eventually. Knowledge? Responsibilities? It's all a formality. 

So many doctors, teachers, lawyers don't know the first thing about what their responsibilities are or what they practice. There's even a very popular saying in Eastern Europe like ""neprivalgęs neprilaižysi"" which basically says that if you didn't try before, don't try when you are crammed for time or in an emergency. Which is just so toxic. But that's what I've heard a lot before every exam I had to take etc.

So if you ever wonder why Russians are a little bit worse off in many of their responsibilities, this culture is a huge factor. Many don't bother to learn what the responsibilities are, much less how to carry them out. 

And I believe firmly this played a role in today's incident, as in many incidents in history. It's not only Russian aviation that suffers from this, but also nuclear plants (very many incidents not even bothered to write up by first parties), water treatment systems, etc.

Or maybe this is a part of some larger mentality I don't see yet. It would be interesting to hear from others who've come from these parts.",,/r/europe/comments/bl3zf4/moscow_plane_fire_at_least_41_killed_on_aeroflot/emmsgu3/,_poised,1557135999

And it would be both an administrative mess and an undemocratic unnaccountable nightmare, as it would depend on executive-level decisions on international treaties that can't be overruled by courts.

&gt;It is not impossible to be prosperous without the EU.

It's not impossible to cook a meal while blindfolded, but why would you handicap yourself on purpose?

&gt;It is the more and more growing of political involvement from the EU that people are sceptical about,

That's your claim. In actuality, the EU is just one of the scapegoats for diffuse discontentment, much like ""immigrants"", because it's easier to blame something specific that can be cast as an outsider and the obvious (but false) solution of ""remove the *Fremdkörper* from the body of society!"", rather than make a proper socio-economic analysis and find out what out what really causes that discontentment and try to figure out a way to change it.

That being said, I think most people (and economists) think that we should change the way we tax cars.

3477,"  Elected President of the French Republic in 1931, Paul Doumer was assassinated a little over a year after his election to the Salomon de Rothschild Hotel by Paul Gorgulov, a Russian doctor who wanted to condemn France's passivity in the conflict against the Bolsheviks.

    President Doumer was taken to hospital and suffered a haemorrhage and died the next day at 4:37 a.m.

    His attacker was sentenced to death and guillotined on 14 September at the Health Prison. Paul Doumer is the second president murdered after Sadi Carnot and the third with Félix Faure to die during his term.

If electric vehicles would be strongly subsidized, it would in effect be  a subsidy from people who can't afford such a car even with a subsidy to those that can. That's the perverse effect I have problems with: it punishes poverty/low middle class status and rewards having means.

And I'm affraid just about any ecological policy measure is turning out that way: Belgian solar panel subsidies sure did.

That is a problem policy makers need to figure out: how to incentivize more expensive green solution without doing it on the back of those that can't afford it and who are more likely to continue to live higher polluting lives simply because they can't pay for a new car, solar panels, the zero-emission house renovation etc.",Belgian in NZ,/r/europe/comments/bkww10/half_of_new_cars_sold_in_norway_are_electric_or/emmh5jd/,TheApatheist,1557122849

If there was enough time to notify the tower of an emergency, for the plane crash land, evacuate the passengers, and still wait for 4 minutes before the airport emergency services got there, someone fucked up badly. That is assuming those response times are actually correct, I have no idea if they are, but they are high.

As a comparison, I've worked at medical facility near a small airport and the response time from getting an emergency notification ─ which comes when there is a potential crash situation or immediately after an unexpected incident ─ to having an ambulance speeding towards the airport was 60 seconds. In reality it was less than that. The ambulance would reach the field 2-3 minutes later, arriving after the fire control group, which was stationed at the airport itself. There is no way in hell an international airport emergency service should take so long to reach the plane, especially since they knew it was going to make an emergency landing and at what runway. They would have been notified before the emergency landing attempt and be waiting for the plane as it came down.

3612,"Breton is one of 6 remaining Celtic languages, with the other 5 being from the British Isles (Welsh, Cornish, Scottish Gaelic, Irish Gaelic, and Manx).

All 6 languages are rooted in the British Isles, with Breton being more closely related to Welsh and Cornish as Breton is the result of a period of migration by Celts from Britain at around the same time as the Anglo-Saxons were expanding *and* assimilating Britons throughout the area which is now England (except for Cornwall, most of Devon, and parts of places like Herefordshire - Archenfield in Herefordshire was still Welsh speaking into the 1800's). These migrating Celts spread their culture into what is now Brittany; evidence for it is in the names - the words Breton and Briton sound the same because they used to be the same, Cornouaille in Brittany is just a Frankified Cornwall, and so on.

Breton is part of a wider history of a people, a wider culture. Celtic culture once spread from the Black Sea to the Hebrides and was the predominant culture group in western, not graeco-roman, Europe. Now it's 6 languages, 3 of which are at risk of dying - Cornish, Breton and Scottish Gaelic.

For anyone wobbling on whether they like them or not, I'd like to share a detail about them.

They've come to Denmark as well, but not really. The scooters are here, but there's no danish office, and there are no danish employees.

You can apply to be a ""Team member"", and then you get 3 dollars minimum for recharging them, and placing them back on the street (up to 5 dollars, I think, of you retreive one that's been out of action for some time,or place your scooters in a particularly attractive location, so they're used a lot)

But there's no contract, and there's no way to arbitrate, and if you don't get your money, there's nothing you can really do.

Because of the terms, it's mostly attractive to people who can't legally work, or who speak Danish, or in some other way is separated from the job market in general, and these people are even worse off, when they get fucked by their employer. Sorry, *""team leader""*. 

On top of that, there are laws about where you can put up signs, rental bikes, and this pre-existing law also applies to scooters.

However, the scooter company simply says ""We instruct our team members to follow the rules"", while they monetarily reward those that break the rules.

Similarly, almost everyone still calls her party by its old name. The new name only changed one word, and it’s clearly a political publicity stunt.

Le Pen has done many efforts to make her party votable and acceptable. This is known as dédiabolisation. It’s so well-known it even has its own sketch, depicting a guy whose job it is to make the far right acceptable.

3985,"There are a few reasons for learning a language. The most obvious one is to be able to communicate with more people, but even when that isn't the case (like in instances where everyone who speaks a language also speaks another, more widely used one) there are significant reasons to learn them.

One can be to integrate better in a community. Even if others can switch languages when speaking with you and they don't mind doing so, sharing a language is a factor that subconsciously makes us feel as more legitimate members of a group, and viceversa.

But my favourite reason is that there is good evidence that languages actually shape the way we see the world. Well, to be fair, everyone sees the world differently to a degree, and there are a multitude of factors contributing to that, but the words, expressions, sounds that a language offers to us, that we grow with, add a whole new dimension to the way we are able to perceive reality. Conversely, every time a language disappears, so do those dimensions and thoughts, forever.

4003,"&gt; Which brings us back to your ""Poles secretly controlled the German Empire"" nonsense.

??? Where? where did I make such a point? You're making things up.

&gt; Like, exactly what interest would Germans have in supposedly inflating the number of Poles? Especially if they planned on creating a puppet Lithuanian state in this area in the future?

Same interest as the Soviets had. Divide and conquer. you are probably not aware of this but you mentioned a few soviet propaganda talking points. Actually your whole point about the population of Vilnius region being Polish is nonsensical because they simply didn't identify as modern Poles. Nazis and Soviets focused on ethnicities and nationalities for a few different reasons. For the nazis is was about ethnic cleanse they had to pseudo science the ethnicities before they could cleanse them and for Soviets it was to squelch partisan resistance. 

&gt; There were no internationally recognized borders of Lithuania at the time.

So what? You're acting like Lithuania as a concept only appeared in the 19th century. There were clear defined borders during the PLC times. Everyone in the region knew where Lithuania Proper was and Lithuania is first mentioned in 1009 in  written records. The border between Latvia and Lithuania is one of the oldest borders of Europe since the 11th or 12th century. You're grasping at straws. Borders were descriptional not prescription for most of human history. a few years of uncertainty holds no merit against a millennia.

&gt; The fact that you chose a particular city as your capital doesn't mean shit if this city happens to be outside your borders.

That's a ridiculous statement. It wasn't. Vilnius is the capital of Lithuanians **at least** since 1323. 

&gt; Mexico could chose San Francisco to be their capital as well, but unless they actually control it, this is a vague declaration of what they might wish as a country.

Why would they do that? Was San francisco ever the capital for mexicans? I thought Tenochtitlan was the capital for the people who are now mexicans. 

&gt; claiming a city where 2% of population was of your nationality as your ""capital""

There were no modern Poles Lithuanians or Belarusians at the time. Your perspective on nationality is not only meaningless but also extremely disingenuous when talking about that time period.

&gt; accusing others of ""nationalistic drivel""

what else are you fueled by if facts cannot sway you?

Let alone that war just went through, Soviets were trying to put fresh territory under control and they had bigger issues that what is one's ethnicity.

It seems to me that you're mixing up the Belarussians that used to live around Vilnius before WWII and the immigrants who arrived after that period. The first group were mostly Catholic and so many identified as Poles. The second group were from all over Belarus and had no special reason to identify as Poles (which under the Soviet system would have been strongly discouraged at least). They would be more likely to assimilate to Russians. Also the most Polish regions in Lithuania are rural, while most postwar immigrants settled in the large cities.

""The consensus from both sources is highly questionable at best and this is not coming from me but from experts including Polish ones, buddy. It's wartime propaganda.""

&gt;Same interest as the Soviets had. Divide and conquer.

Coincidentally, divide and conquer is the only reason Soviets gifted you Wilno after they took it from Poland in 1920 (and to some extent in 1939, although at that point your fate as a subdivision of the Soviet Union was already sealed, so they treated it more like a purely administrational division).

&gt;Actually your whole point about the population of Vilnius region being Polish is nonsensical because they simply didn't identify as modern Poles.

Implying that Poles living in western parts of Poland-under-partitions did identify in the same way modern Poles do.

&gt;So what? You're acting like Lithuania as a concept only appeared in the 19th century.

Lithuania as a concept consisting of ""only people who speak the language from the Baltic group can call themselves Lithuanians, while everyone else should fuck off"", which was the Republic of Lithuania's stance, did appear only in 19th century. Inhabitants of the Grand Duchy would shudder at the thought of something so far removed from the idea of their homeland.

&gt;That's a ridiculous statement. It wasn't. Vilnius is the capital of Lithuanians at least since 1323. 

Then a portion of Lithuanians decided to exclude from their nation everyone who wasn't speaking a language from the Baltic group, so those people had to look for some other identity for themselves. Those who happened to speak Polish, became Poles as a result.

&gt;Why would they do that? Was San francisco ever the capital for mexicans?

I have no fucking idea why a Baltic speaking newly created country has chosen a Polish speaking city as their capital either.

&gt;I never said the things you think I did. You are making it all up.

4071,"This is burden of late 19th century/early 20th century nationalistic Lithuanian historiography. 

During the Commonwealth Lithuanian elites were quickly adopting Polish language and culture, especially nobility, but generally preserved somekind of Lithuanian separatism and awareness of separate historical heritage, but it also gradually declined overtime. It only accelerate after partitions. Commonwealth was partitioned between hostile powers and partitions borders cared a litlle about former internal borders of Commonwealth. Also the common struggle overshadowed old separatism. Polish language and culture quickly was used but almost entire catholic nobility and middle class, also many peasants adopted it, especially those of them who wanted to gain education and social advance. Polish was bascially language of educated class. 

To put it briefly inteligentsia in Lithuania was divided on three uneven parts: one group of Polish Lithuanians that felt strong connection with Polish nationality and culture, and were unable to imagine independent Poland without Lithuania; second group that had strong separate Lithuanian identity, but also did not want to cut off themselves from Polish culture and resign from Polish language, they also did not see Poland as an enemy and wanted strong cooperation even union of both states; and third group that was strongly polonophobic, saw Poland as eternal enemy and wanted to cut off all ties with Poland. Funily enough they often also used Polish as their first language. They also often originated from lower class, so for them Lithuanian nationalistic struggle was strongly linked with social struggle with Polish nobility and middle class. The third group created modern Lithuanian state.

The fight over Vilnius was also crucial part of ultimate separation of both nations. Lithuania lost Vilnius to Poland and saw this as a great disaster. In fact it was their great advantage. Interwar Lithuania already had big Polish minority with Vilnius region Polish minority would be too big to dominate, could even overshadow Lithuanian oriented inteligentsia. So losing of Vilnius was actually great excuse to start great anti-Polish campaign. Poland was presented as great enemy, Polish noble was a caricature that wanted to steal not only Lithuanian independence but aslo land from peasants. Polish people in Lithuania were persecuted and stripped of land. The myth of ""lost, occupied capital"" basically shaped modern Lithuanian identity.

Being overweight, not working extra hours you could, taking holidays, retiring - the state could equally tax or strip away such things under the same rationale you give. Individual freedom and taxation rub against one another very directly.

The insistence that they tolerate unwanted immigration into their lands would look a lot like how [China is trying to destroy Tibet by exporting millions of people to it in the hopes they will eventually outnumber](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/6418456/Labour-wanted-mass-immigration-to-make-UK-more-multicultural-says-former-adviser.html) the recalcitrant native Tibetans (if you don’t believe me, believe the Dalai Lama, who apparently has the same [perspective](https://www.france24.com/en/20180912-dalai-lama-says-europe-belongs-europeans)). The claim that they’re confused bout their own economic self-interest would give way to discussions of Bhutan style “[gross national happiness](https://ophi.org.uk/policy/national-policy/gross-national-happiness-index/)”.

4164,"&gt; Production has to be taken into account

you were the one who didn't in your first comment, referring to usage.

&gt; BEVs are no better than ICE vehicles under most circumstances

Thats your conclusion. In fact under normal circumstances EV is better than ICE, pollutionwise.

&gt; It's also the reason why you should drive your car until its engine brakes and not buy a shiny new BEV after three years of using your old car.

Agree. Energy was already spent on production, ideally should be used until End of Life (of the car :D )

&gt; 100km range, so an unrealistically tiny battery

good enough for city car, most of those bilions of km total from all drivers (excluding trucks, thats a different industry) are actually done in this regime, daily commute, few dozens km /day.

&gt; It also compares against an ICE vehicle using unleaded fuel, not diesel

Then we're not talking only about CO2 (which indeed decreases) anymore but much worse polution with other substances. Diesel looks better in this graph just because some pollution is moved from CO2 to other substances that are not taken into consideration here.

&gt; When you adjust those parameters to a BEV with 600km

This is where you go off rails. Your scenario is unrealistic. Not that 600km wouldn't be desired, with current technology and cost such EV are to expensive for mass market. 300km are much more realistic for now. In which case EVs still stay ahead of Diesel for the duration of their life if look only at CO2. Not to mention, like I said, in diesel case, other substances not included in this graph. Yes, in the future range might be significant bigger, $/km autonomy will drop, but if during same period CO2/kwh drops (recycling, technological improvements) then CO2/car produced might remain relatively the same for even bigger ranges, once those ranges will hit mass market. (which is not the case atm, most EVs have 200-300km range).

Bottom line, if we look at realistic scenarios (600km is not realistic atm) EVs are still better than ICE even for overall polution in their lifetime, not to mention moving the pollution in remote areas, which is by no means a small thing.

The worst thing ever ? Insurance. People don’t know that but when you drive anything with a motor in a road in France you are automatically subjected to the Badinter law. This law basically makes it so that anytime this driver is involved in an accodent with a walking individual the driver is presumed guilty. This means that if you hit someone with your shitty trotinette the bills are for you or your insurance and since you are guilty it s most mike you that will pay those (astronomical) bills.

You may say « even if that happens i have insurance ». Well no you don t. The contracts of those trotinette services all have that in common : they specificall warn you you have 0 insurance from their side.

With dwindling chances at having a good life or providing for one's own as an individual, you need to be on a team, one that you can trust and which accepts you as one of their own.

Because Western polities have repeatedly subverted *civic* nationalism (in the US, repeated amnesties for illegal immigration and anchor baby citizenship, in Europe, the wholesale entry of refugees, in both, large scale non-Western immigration transforming electorates and demographics), ethnic nationalism is going to rear its head.

You can adopt all sorts of elective identities; you cannot alter your descent or ethnic history - it is the product of the same circumstances that mean your parents love you - your birth to it.

4275,"Usually bike lanes in Germany are red (or not painted). However, in Berlin they decided to paint the new ones in green and just use red in dangerous spots. The idea is that psychologically, red is a warning color while green is relaxing. Another aspect is that the green color creates a sort of brand for the new, better bike infrastructure (though they're also painting existing lanes, which helps a bit against people parking there).

The bollards are pretty much a new concept here and only exist in two or three places in the entire city so far. But the exact way the bike lanes are separated from cars and pedestrians depends a lot on the street layout in each area. They try to avoid having to fell trees, for example, and Berlin has lots of trees along its streets.

As for intersections, they're mostly shit so far. Theoretically the new law forces them to fix them as well, but I think they still have to figure out how exactly they're going to do the layout.

4315,"&gt; I'm pro us being in, it's only for economic reasons

So you're not that keen on the ""inetgration"" part, but are sensible enough to know that neither side benefits if you cut the economic and ties? Fine by me!

I mean, let's leave politics aside for a moment. Ask any economic historian about the economic ties between, say, the UK and Germany. They are massive in scale ever since the onset of industrialisation, and literally the only way to cut them is by deliberately putting up barriers or engaging in major armed conflicts. 

Which would suggest that the economies of the UK and Germany are very much compatible and have been so for extended periods of time and both sides profit neatly from it. It'd be utter folly to not recognise that and think that anything good will come from kiboshing them. 

And what's the problem with striking *bilateral* agreements as to the free movement of Brits and Germans? Last time I checked, even the most rabid Leavers weren't making the case that you'd have to stop the influx of all those Germans into the country. They don't depress wages, they don't any incentive to immigrate into your welfare sytem (they've got one at home already), and they tend to kick something in once they settle in the country.

4372,"France did a lot actually, just the opposite way at first. [This was the situation in France before WW1](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/46/51/f4/4651f417511aa26300720365f683d90c.jpg), French was actually only spoken by some aristocrats and intelectuals, almost no one was speaking French but local dialects.

Then came WW1 and many people in France got together in the front lines, and communication was... difficult. It was an issue in the French army, often forcing to pass written orders because some soldiers could not understand eachother orally. Since then the government did on purpose promote French and passed laws for all schools in France to only teach French, for all administratives offices to only use French, so local dialects would die. And they did it well for decades, that most of them died and no one speaks them or even remember them, only a handfull still exists.

Until the 70-80's when they wanted to break with the war/post-war politics and decide that culture was something to care about. But it was too late for many dialects. For catalan, the region of northern catalaonia did a lot since the 80's to promote catalan, like OP map show 40% of French in the region know catalan, which is not so bad. But if you take [the socially spoken figures](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pays_catalans#Usage_social), it falls to 1% while it is that 50% for catalonia.

So the governements of the 10-70's did so well their work to kill dialects that most of French people don't see the value of dialects anymore, even if recently they try to keep the last ones alive.",France,/r/europe/comments/bkvja9/minority_languages_in_france/emk5ouk/,Azaret,1557064439

His hunger strike revolved around people like him being treated as political prisoners as they were, as opposed to criminals. In Prison he was elected to British Parliament in his constituency, where he died a month later due to starvation.  There were riots and protests across Europe, and over 100,000 people lined the route of Sands's funeral.

Furthermore of 122 candidates elected they elected their first gay candidate, despite it being a party against gay marriage, and formerly sodomy.
* Leo Varadkar, the Taoiseach (Prime Minister) of Ireland, just admitted he was ""wrong"" about the Waterford hospital scandal and it was indeed as bad as the media reported.

Some quotes by the AfD:  

* ""The idea of parties has to be overcome, inner unity to be reached. [...] [We need] a demanding and encouraging political elite to rekindle the Volksgeist."" ""It needs a strong personality and a firm hand on a long line, to control the centrifugal forces and focus them into political force."" This is hard to translate, in the german original, this sounds like a deliberate nod to the Führerprinzip.

* they have antisemites and holocaust-deniers among their ranks  (Wolfgang Gedeon, Wilhelm von Gottberg, Martin Hohmann and others). These are not just just normal members, but were placed highly on party lists (in Germany you vote for a party and the more votes they get, the more people from the party list go to parliament. They are ranked, i.e. if you are place 1 you are almost certain to go to parliament, place 10 only if your party gets enough votes for 10 seats etc.) and are now in parliaments for them. Von Gottberg and Hohmann were kicked out of the conservative CDU 20 years ago for their outspoken antisemitism, and AfD have decided to bring them back  to our parliament.  
* Björn Höcke, who is the head of the AfD in Thuringia, a German state, called the *Memorial to the Murdered Jews in Europe* a ""monument of shame"" and wanted to do a ""180° turn in Germany's treatment of history"". He also has applied the r and k procreation strategies (frogs lay thousands of eggs, leave them on their own and only few survive vs. elephants have one child and care for it) from biology to human groups, basically saying Africans create lots of children most of whom die off whereas Europeans have few children and care for them.  
* AfD were founded by a conservative economics professor, who tried to prevent the party from shifting too much to the right. He was ousted by Frauke Petry, who wanted to ""give 'völkisch' a positive connocation again"" (her own words; the word ""völkisch"" relates to the [Völkisch movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C3%B6lkisch_movement#Before_and_after_World_War_I), and not to the romantic parts. Nowadays the word is clear way to recognize far-righters). She wanted to exclude Björn Höcke from the party for his statements, but failed and was dethroned herself.  
* Alexander Gauland, the 2017 federal election candidate and one of the current leaders who was crucial in dethroning Petry strives for a ""reevaluation of the accomplishments of German soldiers in both world wars""; also, after the federally appointed German integration commissioner Aydan Özoguz made statements about German culture he disagreed with, he said he wanted to ""dispose of her in Anatolia""  
* at their federal party congress in 2016, a speaker who advocated for cooperation with Islam associations to aid in the fight against Islamic extremism and radicalisation was booed at from the party reps. And they have only radicalized since then, back then it was the Petry times   
  
[Here](http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/afd-im-bundestag-das-sind-die-neuen-abgeordneten-a-1169756.html) you can find a list of some of the AfD MdBs (in German). The neo-nazi and extreme right part of the party is definitely stronger than the economic-liberal one.

In the recent months, the AfD has taken some steps to get rid of its most neo-nazi members, e.g. kicking out Doris von Sayn-Wittgenstein, who was close to Reichsbürger (kind of far-right sovereign citizens who belive the German constitution of 1949 isn't valid and they still live in the Weimar Germany) and involved with right-wing extremist associations, out of their state parliament club, but this happened mostly due to pressure of a German domestic intelligence investigation, which could potentially ultimately lead to the party being banned. Note that Sayn-Wittgenstein was not kicked out of the party itself. Note that the AfD is the only major party where the above statements keep on reappearing and are supported by top leadership.

4649,"&gt; Before edit you asked if that's the best I could do. Well, you only asked to name one. I named two. 

I removed that comment because I though it was unfair and a bit rude, but the reason I included it to begin with was because your examples still make wide use of a grid based planning. Particularly Boston.

Although Charlotte uses less grid, I think that it's still important to note that the core of the city has as grid as it gets, and everything else, whilst not being grid, is completely planned. Charlotte doesn't feel even remotely organic, in many ways it has the same artificially planned layout as most grid based US cities. You won't find any maze of tight alleyways, haphazard and convoluted roads in Charlotte - it's ordered. 

As to your link, we're really getting into angels dancing on the head of a pin territory here now. I did take a look though, London's street direction entropy isn't 0.015, that is its *orientation order indicator*. 
This paper examines several different metrics for spatial ordering, in none of them does London emerge as any more like a US city than most other European settlements. 

You specifically say that London is more grid based than Berlin, Rome and Moscow (actually what you really mean is has a lower orientation order coefficient), but then according to the same measure is less 'grid based' than Amsterdam, Athens, Budapest, Copenhagen, Glasgow, Dublin, Lisbon, Madrid, Munich, Paris and Prague, so why bring it up, seems a bit meaningless? 

The take away from the results in that article is that US cities are decidedly more ordered than European, London is not an exception to the rule and Charlotte is simply a special case.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/bko9eb/london_sunset_from_north_greenwich_emirates_air/emjr0j4/,MyFavouriteAxe,1557043195

Some countries weren't being bombed daily, people living off rations, children sent to live in the countryside away from their parents out of cities while still trying to fight our way of the corner we were backed into.

We had been forced out of the Indian ocean three months before the famine by the Japanese. Believe it or not, we had other things to think about.

Lets take a look at what was happening when the Bengal famine began.

The UK was bombing Berlin in night raids. We were fighting in Libya against Rommel. The Japanese had defeated the USA in navel battle  losing USS chicago. The UK sent elite unitw into Burma, where the Japanese had taken control, stopping food supply lines into Bengal (where they got most of their food from).Germany liquidates the Jewish ghetto in Krakow. Huge losses in the atlantic, due to U-boats. UK breaksthrough into Tunisia. British break the Mareth line. Stalemate between the Japanese and USA at the Aleuthian Islands.

4747,"Almost certainly.

Just so you understand what we're dealing with here Europe;

On Thursday, we had local elections for councillors and stuff like that. Normally, it's the least important elections anyone has, yet here's what happened...

Conservatives (pro-leave) lost some 1300 seats
Labour (reluctantly pro-leave) lost hundreds of seats
UKIP only had 17 to be fair, but ended with 8
Meanwhile, both Lib Dems and Green (pro-remain parties) took seats from the Brexit parties.

Now anyone would think this means that the public have had enough of Brexit right? Apparently not. Theresa May responded that the people clearly want to get on with Brexit faster, and that this was a sign that people had lost confidence in the government dragging their heals. The BBC are also maintaining this shtick, while the right-wing newspapers are smugly saying that this was a punishment to pro-EU politics. The left and central papers are saying nothing of consequence.

Now supposing all of this is true, I have just one question: ""why did we all vote Lib Dems and not UKIP then?""",Europe,/r/europe/comments/bkr50q/democracy_under_attack_was_brexit_bought/emjmqmn/,DontWantToBeOnReddit,1557036637

Find some dignity and stop participating in the race to the bottom.

You simply increase productivity/effectiveness and start competing for employees instead of taking them for granted as slaves.

* Shadow sector.

* People that aren't able to find a desired job.

The empire really struggled with its own size and you would be kinda foreshadowing the EU's downfall (may it come or not) if you use Rome as a symbol like that. And beyond that you have a whole set of countries which have never been part of the Roman empire, most prominently perhaps Germany which not only derives that English name from Ceasar's term for the never romanized tribes on the other side of the Rhine but which as a country has the [Battle of the Teutoburg Forest
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Teutoburg_Forest) as the starting point of its foundational myth. And invoking Rome as the example for your aspirations is not exactly original either - see the Holy Roman Empire  (which was neither Holy, nor Roman and arguably not even an Empire). The imperialist overtones are also not exactly what you probably should be going for, especially when it comes to the EU having more and less dominant members and increasingly a foreign policy towards especially Africa.

Aix-la-Chapelle/Aachen makes a lot more sense considering the EU's origin and its objective as a peace project (not so much because of Charlemagne but with France and Germany and all that). Geographically it would also be better than Rome.

...personally I'm not sure if having a proper EU capital is actually something which would be good. Centralization is more efficient but it also has a number of negative side effects, you see that in many countries where the capital dominates the country politically, economically and often also culturally. Now, Bussels is de facto the capital of the EU, with the European Commission and the Council of the European Union being situated there - in a way its a rather practical location and it not being in either France or Germany is probably good. EU Parliament being in Strasbourg also seems fine (which symbolically is not too far from your Aix-la-Chapelle/Aachen idea, even if it lacks the specific smybolism of Charlemagne).

Personally I wished that if the EU got an Army that its headquarters were situated somewhere else - perhaps Prague or perhaps strategically more prudent in Madrid or whatnot but considering that NATO is already in Brussels that seems kinda inevitable.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/bko77u/the_rightful_capital_of_the_eu/emj6vnu/,Bekoni,1557020841

4930,"&gt;A foreign country granting political asylum doesn't suddenly remove his obligations to the courts in the UK after all. 

No, but that's not abuse. Abuse is predicated upon the idea that the country granting asylum had no valid reason to do it. That's what you're actually arguing. And Ecuador disagreed, at the time. 

&gt; And Asylum requests do have legitimacy and an impact, on the state they are made to.. 

But not the state they are made against, when it's the UK. Right? It's impossible for the UK to pursue politically motivated prosecution, or for it to support politically motivated prosecution in another country? 

&gt;He didn't feel the need to claim asylum until it looked like the UK justice system...came to the conclusion that he should be extradited. 

So he lost in UK SC, and another state granted him asylum based on the fact they they believed he was being politically prosecuted. But obviously there was nothing valid about the granting of asylum, right?

All of this is politics. It has nothing to do with rape. Rape is a means to an end.

The UK is pursuing a guy that Sweden wants because the US wants him.

What's stopping the French Government from saying ""Extremists don't get free speech, we classify the yellow vests as extremists, so supporting the yellow vests for wanting change gets you jail :-)""?

4953,"Well, I kind of think we'd all agree we all owe a hell of a lot of our culture, law, history and more to the Romans. The way I see it, Roman civilization began as a republic, turned into an empire, split in two, one half became a sort of soft pseudo-empire in the shape of the Catholic church, some of which was eventually consolidated briefly by Charlemagne. The holy Roman empire surely shows that the idea of Rome was a powerful one even in the Germanic countries, that's why they took the name. I believe the eastern empire had as great an influence even in Russia. From one perspective , we can say the empire fell, or by taking a more generous view we can say that the empire has taken many forms over two millennia and the EU is the 'democratic' inheritor of its legacy.

The imperialist overtones might seem like a negative now, but give it ten or twenty years and European Unionists might be very attracted to the symbolism of reclaiming the ancient capital, especially in a very different world dominated by China, a state with 3,000+ years of history behind it.

Now I think about it, we of course also owe a lot of our culture, law, history and more to the Ancient Greeks. Perhaps Athens would be a good choice? The Greek economy would surely benefit.

Nordic settled lands, primarily in the Hebrides and the Northern Isles, had significant influence on early Scottish history; Indeed, several of the famous Scottish clans, have mixed Nordic-Gaelic origins, such as the Clan MacDonald and Clan MacDougall, both of whom trace their ancestry to Somerled, a Norse-Gaelic warlord who reigned in the 12th Century. The influence of old Nordic culture on modern Scotland can be seen also in place names; Innse Gall is the Scottish name for the Hebrides, which in Scottish Gaelic means the Islands of the Foreigners(And they're not talking about the English here.), or in person names: Anyone with the surnames of say, MacGyver, MacAskill or Cotter, would perhaps be interested to know that their names are descended from viking names. It is also believed that the viking attacks forced the various Gaelic tribes and small areas to work together to hold the Norse conquerors back, eventually forming the nucleus for the formation of the Kingdom of Scotland.

5020,"&gt;But I think that sentiment is still willfully ignoring the very real costs the current monetary policy with the Eure and the Common Market, impose on weaker economies.

 

The problem is that a single currency for very different areas. According to Mundell (who developed the only theory that could have justified the adoption of the single euro in Europe OCA that is by the way criticized by the way). Introduction of a single currency can be economically advantageous for everyone if you have:

1. Flexibility of wages and prices, so that changes in aggregate demand are matched by similar changes, up or down, in wages and prices
2. Mobility of productive factors, capital and workers
3. Integration of the capital market, so as to have the same interest rates on credit
4. Free movement of goods, without any kind of barriers
5. Fiscal integration, with a common budget that provides for the redistribution of money to compensate for the trade deficits between the areas that make up the economic area

In Europe we cannot say that wage and price trends, measured by the inflation rate, are uniform across countries.

1. The mobility of workers is not so simple in Europe, especially for linguistic reasons, but also for the great cultural differences between the various countries. It is true that our young people who have emigrated to England or Germany have found work (what is not in Italy), but it is unthinkable that all Italians emigrate to other countries to adapt to the needs of the single currency.
2. Even the interest rates on credit are not equal, resulting always higher in peripheral areas, such as Italy. This despite the absolute freedom of movement of capital in Europe.
3. The free movement of goods between the various European countries was decided at the political level, along with the free movement of capital
4. The only possible mechanism for adjusting between the inevitable imbalances between the different areas of the economic area, due to the inevitable drawbacks described above, is fiscal transfers. But this is impossible. Why should a German from Bavaria support a hospital in Calabria?

&amp;#x200B;

In USA, which although speaking the same language everywhere, despite having a much more homogeneous culture compared to the different European countries and despite having a single banking system, the net fiscal transfers from the richest areas to the poorest ones reach up to 20% of the GDP American. This is to avoid excessive differences between the different areas of the country.

In this way the USA can keep the gross domestic product between 130% compared to the national average, in the rich state of New York and 65% of the poor state of Mississippi. 

The introduction of the euro is causing distortions that enormously benefit one part of Europe and damage the other. The end of the ECB's Quantitative Easing, expected in the coming months, together with the fragility of the German banking system (Deutsche Bank did not pass the stress tests in the US, for the umpteenth time) and the repercussions deriving from the escalation of the introduction of duties trade in trade with the US, could lead to the collapse of the economic system built around the single euro and the end of Europe.

- The Republic of Lithuania was formed in 1918

- in that period, the city was changing hands between the German Ober-ost command, Republic of Poland, and Soviets several times, until Soviets gifted it to Republic of Lithuania in summer of 1920 after conquering it from Poland. Poland retook the city several months later, after defeating Soviets.

- the city was a part of Poland in the interwar period, and continued to have a Polish majority throughout it. The people depicted are descendants of city's population in that period.

Which blend of different styles is superior to others is a very subjective thing. There are no rules. I don't think London can be described as anything else but eclectic when it comes to blending styles. To which I'd prefer any kind of order. 

And then there's the ""how"" you rate modernity. Does Bauhaus or Scandinavian design of interiors in old town count? What about in shops? Do their new large glass windows contrast with their originally baroque architecture to qualify as enough of a mix for you? They do for me.

5183,"While on a political level, the Commonwealth times were a period when Poland and Lithuania dominated Eastern Europe together, Lithuanians can't be very happy about the cultural aspect of it. You see, the formation of the Commonwealth nearly destroyed Lithuanian language and culture.  
Poles weren't Imperial Russians, they weren't forcing anyone to learn Polish, it happened voluntairly. First the (by that point, in many cases Ruthenized) nobles Polonized, at the end of the Commonwealth period even the townsfolk began to be mostly Polish speaking, under the early rule of Imperial Russia even the peasants started to Polonize.  


But the fact remains that the Polish crown was the dominant part of the Commonwealth. On paper, both The Crown and the Grand Duchy were equal, they had separate armies, separate laws, separate treasuries and so on. But Poland, compared to Lithuania was very desnly populated. Lithuania, while large, was almost empty. Thus, populous, more modern Poland was the center of power during the period. On the other side, some of the most powerful magnates, especially later on, were Lithuanian nobles, but that's another matter. All in all, after the Union of Lublin, Lithuania became essentialy the junior partner.   
Baltic speaking Lithuanians were always a minority, even before the Union they were a tiny water drop in the sea of Eastern Slavs. Who knows how the history would've unfolded without the Union, as the nobles were already under heavy Ruthenian influence, but Polonization resulted in ethnic Lithuanians being essentialy reduced to peasants by the early XIX century.  


Add to that the recent, 20 century history of Poland and Lithuania after the independance. While during the January Uprising Poles and Lithuanians marched together to fight the Russians, by 1918 they were two separate nations, each with their own view on their common history, each with different goals. Poles wanted to recreate the Commonwealth, while the Lithuanians didn't even wanted to hear about it - they connected the period with the Polonization, and wanted their own, independent country.  
Subsequent war for Vilnius and Suvalkai regions resulted in a very bitter feelings on both sides, but especially Lithuanians, who were stripped of their own capital, Vilnius, and had to relocate it to Kaunas. The Lithuanians even closed any diplomatic relations with Poland after that (which resulted in very strange situations, where, for example, if you wanted to send a package from Poland to Lithuania it had to be sent to Latvia first, where it would be stripped of any markings denoting the Polish origin of the package, and only then sent further. Strange stuff).  


Not to mention Polish coup attempts on the Lithuanian government, hell, the takeover of the Vilnius region was essentially a coup, too. The diplomatic relations with Lithuania were reopened only when Poland threatened Lithuania with war.  


So... That's why the feelings are a bit bitter to this day.",,/r/europe/comments/bklksz/the_polish_minority_in_lithuania_celebrates_the/emioyer/,Vitaalis,1557006921
5184,"&gt; Which blend of different styles is superior to others is a very subjective thing

We're not discussing the outright aesthetics, although I think that there is a strong case to be made that London accomplishes this better than most, we are talking about diversity, variety, interest and character. Uniformity and planning does not deliver that.

&gt; I don't think London can be described as anything else but eclectic

You're making my arguments for me. 

&gt; when it comes to blending styles

Most major cities on the continent barely even 'try'...

&gt; Does a huge steel industrial world wonder immediately by Champ de Mars surrounded by an old town count?

Yes, absolutely, but those are hardly surrounded by an 'old town'. The are surrounded by a city that is overwhelmingly classical at its core. It's beautiful but it's also a little bit boring.

Yes.

The UK ones have a political incentive, also...

&gt; Also, if he didn't get more than the maximum he could get for the offense, how is the sentence disproportionate?

I'm no expert in UK law, but the maximum sentence is usually reserved for repeat offenders. First offenders usually get a tiny fraction of that.

Access to the Scheldt meant access to Antwerp and Ghent, so the Austrians wanted to be allowed pasage across the Western Scheldt. The Dutch said nope. The Habsburgs then realised that they didn't really have any legal footing to force passage, and they failed in getting other nations on their side.

... In an effort to make a point about sentiments in the Netherlands. Yes, quite strange. 

&gt; can't find it. Please provide some more links and research.

&gt;The Ipsos research bureau also asked about voters' motives in the survey. Respondents who voted for FvD said in a large majority that their vote was against the government. 79 percent of the respondents indicated that. The most important reason for voting against the government is the cost of climate measures and immigration and integration.

&gt;It has become quite apparent you have unrealistic expectations of the amount of effort a random person on the internet is willing to go through to convince you. That is OK. You can look it up yourself, there are great tools for that.

I see that you omitted the paragraph were I asked whether you was just guessing like me was (since you claimed I had double standards). No surprise there. 

But yes, indeed. The polls shows that they blame and votes against the governments according to what I've found. You then argue that this is false and that they really blame the EU for it which seems to be something you have totally made up on your own and is not mirrored in the polls that you yourself provided. 

&gt;The 95% is not something an exact number, but that the majority of anti-EU sentiment comes from national policy, national politicians pointing at Brussels and misinformation being spread is clear from the years and years of news about it, the Euromyths, the reasons we saw given for the Brexit votes and the reasons why people are voting for anti-EU parties. I have said this since the start.

I have said that I don't care about the 95% numbers as such. I want to see a source that actually shows that all the people actually blame the EU for those issues as you claim. It certainly don't look that way based on your own sources, which instead says that they are voting against the local government in the Netherlands (rather than the EU).",,/r/europe/comments/bibf9e/netherlands_poll/emi2tdc/,salvibalvi,1556992497

I travel back to Slovakia several times per year.  Both me and my wife are from small towns - the ones where people keep chicken and pigs in their backyards to supplement their income (my parents had to stop a few years ago when many of their neighbors sold their properties to people from Bratislava, who then complained about the smell and noise).  People in those towns are really hard workers.  And despite their low income (the prevailing wage in my wife's region is 0.50 - 2 Euros per hour, without documentation), their additional work in their yards allows them to save some money.  However, most people I know are afraid to spend that money because of the prevailing jealousy of others, resulting into anything from social ostracism to property damage.  I've seen two direct effects of this: first, people who can open their own business, transfer their income there, pay themselves a minimum wage but live of the business ""profits"" (sorry; this may sound convoluted and a little imprecise, but I'm no accounting expert, but my parents are doing this quite successfully).  Second, people revert to barter economy.  I witnessed numerous occasions when the electrician came to fix a problem in exchange for a dozen eggs, or the plumber was paid in milk.  Neither of those strategies is declared as individual income, and as a result, the prevailing income, for Gini calculation, is depressed across the board.  And I don't believe people do it to cheat on taxes; they do it because they are afraid of being seen as being better off than their neighbors.",Ireland,/r/europe/comments/bjdzkd/move_over_scandinavia_the_most_egalitarian_places/emh7sqq/,Bruncvik,1556970094

5685,"I've looked into it yesterday. It seems that they were a mix of Dorics (greeks) and barbarians (thracians? Illyrians?). That seems reasonable given the geography. In any case, they considered themselves Greeks but (and here's where the contradiction originated) the Greeks often did not.

The period of Macedonian Greece is framed by two events that highlight this:

1-Ahead of the Macedonian rise, Demostenes in his famous speeches said that Philip II of Macedon was ""not a greek but a barbarian"". You wouldn't say that if they were 100% Greeks. But you wouldn't say thay also if they were 100% barbarians. It's clear that many greeks believed that they were Greeks but others did not.

2-The end of Macedonian supremacy. The Romans declared the freedom of the Greeks from the Macedonians after defeating Macedon at Cynocephale. Again, you wouldn't declare this if Macedonians were considered Greeks. Especially the ""you are free"" speech of the roman general Flamininus in Corinth makes a strong distinction between foreigner Macedonians and the Greeks

But the Macedonians themselves considered their Greek part much more important, took part in the Olympic games and spread Greek culture. As you said their capital had a gree origin as a name, but even the term ""Makedon"" derives from a Greek god. Alexander called himself Greek and started the whole Hellenisation thing.

5730,"&gt;Neither do you because you fell into assumption based analysis ignoring the regional context. And even if this would not be an isolated incident (because in fact it is not) too powerful labor unions create an enormous strain on the competitiveness of an economy. Which is basically an observed behavior on many, many markets.

&gt;Korea already has a developer market for goods. The middle class buy whatever they want and it's fairly expensive to buy an imported product, therefore domestic production and consumption of those services is encouraged. Buying the BMWs is a recent trend. 

That was only one of the benefits. Other benefits are improved working conditions and life satisfaction, like [lower working hours](http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20151102001240)(notice how much more Koreans work than Europeans), more secure work contracts, less bogus self-employment, [higher fertility rates, lower suicide rates, higher life expectancy](https://asia.nikkei.com/Features/Overworked/South-Korea-s-work-life-imbalance) and longer [vacation times](https://www.koreabang.com/2012/stories/koreans-receive-least-amount-of-paid-vacations-says-survey.html). Man, those unions must currently be strong in Korea.

&gt;No they dont because it makes no sense whatsoever. The most people that work in small businesses are SELF EMPLOYED are in fact the business owners.

And most of them are bogus self-employed. It is a proved strategy to try to remove overheads and gain workforce without having to give them the legally required benefits a worker deserves.

&gt;And I highly doubt you have any insights into korean culture heck..any culture including your own as being an economic student does not tell you anything about the intricacies of a business to business to supply chain relationship and the challenges all of them face. Again this is a very well observed behavior of companies and how it affects economy. 

Of course we don't learn about how business is conducted because it's not like we have to try to describe it in our models and Korea is so unique we couldn't possibly model it.

&gt;Businesses in Austria reduce hiring of domestic workers and instead hire workers in Slovakia. And it's not always because of the price.

Of course it is about the price. Don't kid yourself. If people can hire an EE  craftsman for half the price black and not be caught they will do it or generally pay immigrant workers less than minimum wage for their labour they will do it. Again, don't kid yourself.

&gt;There are other effects at play like all those indirect factors that add to your competitiveness ( having a large and important city with an amazingly good transportation system or proximity to other markets...or you know having a competent government). With a fairly converged wages ( specific IT sector ) these do not outweigh the benefits of hiring a workforce that does not participate in the labor union. Which is basically again observed behavior of those businesses.

You think economic scientists don't take these considerations into account when trying to discern the effects of unions on the economy and well-being of society. In Econometric Analysis all of these factors are taken into account and they still conclude a positive effect of unions on society.

&gt;In any way these are not even my words about korean chaebol workers participating on the labor unions having too much power. This is basically what almost every analysis from the big corporations say. The korean chaebol workers have too much power, are overpaid and too expensive for the companies.

Wow, don't you think that an analysis by big corporation about wages and work hours might, just might, be a bit bias? No, it must be the unions who complain about long, 48h, work weeks and low hourly wages.

To begin with, when scientists started to talk about the climate changes it was pretty fussy and ‘clouded’ (badabing!) what was going on and many people, included me, thought that the actual change was on behalf of the climate itself. My main source was the Channel4 ‘Great Global Warming Swindle’ that showed that the oceans produces enormous amounts of CO2. Well. They do. The vast majority of CO2 created comes from the oceans. 
The flux is balanced and it’s only within a ‘few’ gigaton to tip the flux. And, for what it seems, humans are just about to tip it and add more CO2 to unbalance the this very sensitive flux.",,/r/europe/comments/bkjfcu/climate_change_is_a_myth/emh3ca8/,peterbateman,1556963447

I don't know about DE, but NL we've had the problem where the government can put out tenders for infrastructure projects, only to get no response because the industry is at capacity, book solid for the coming years.

The babyboomers are retiring, not enough young people are choosing to go into the building industry. This is not an issue where simply throwing money at the problem will fix it.

If we want to get serious about reducing energy consumption we need to insulate millions of houses in the coming decades. There's a serious question who is going to do the work.

*“Baltic cooperation in this period could be compared to a team cycling race where one cyclist (nation) does the hard work for a few laps while the others follow close behind. The initial Latvian phase was briefest, starting with the environmental protests in 1986 and ‘calendar’ demonstrations in 1987; the Singing Revolution was led by the Estonians from the selfmanagement proposal in September 1987 through to autumn 1989; the Lithuanians led the drive to independence beginning from late 1989 when the Lithuanian Communist Party split off from the CPSU. This sequence was largely determined by the demographic situation in each republic.41 Latvians acted first because they felt most acutely the existential threat of becoming a minority in their own country, but they could not push very far without provoking a strong counterforce among the Russian-speaking residents. The Estonian situation was more favourable, but they also could not risk putting all of their cards on the table at once. The Lithuanians awoke last but, being the most homogeneous and strongly united, were able to lead the final push to independence and overcome the sharpest confrontations.”*",Europe,/r/europe/comments/bkioav/on_this_day_29_years_ago_the_declaration_on_the/emgyyah/,ObdurateSloth,1556955553

The Dutch Guilder was tied to the German Mark. Since 1983 (ok, so 35 years) it was 1.12673 guilders to the mark. The Dutch central bank announced their interest rate fives minutes after Germany did. The head of the Dutch central bank was the easiest job in the world.

&gt; It does give the south monetary and fiscal policy back tho that's the point the euro is to solid for the south or do u think their is another issue at play?

Countries can run their fiscal policy however they like. Southern countries have like the lowest interest rates on government bonds since ever, but they choose to spend it on welfare rather than infrastructure.

Currency rates are determined by markets not governments. If you currency goes down that is a implicit tax on primarily poor working people, because money and labour become worth less, while assets maintain their value.

&gt;  why is it our business that italy an independent country is trying to run its finances into the ground?

If Italy runs its finances into the ground, it wouldn't matter if it had its own currency  If they had their own currency the value of labour would be plummeting meaning workers get poorer as inflation goes up. Now the risk is transferred to people with bonds (ie rich people).

Although Italy is an interesting case as most of their bonds are actually owned by Italians.
