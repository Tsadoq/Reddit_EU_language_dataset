3,"Bezos, Martin Skrelli (the fuckin evil pharma bro, I can't spell it), Larry Page, Sergay Brin, Micheal Dell, Elon Musk. All billionaires, none boomers. The best any of them can say about their companies' environmental impact is they are ""not as bad as they could be."" The increase in power use due purely to the internet is more than 6000 MW, which we use largely for photos we will never look at again and porn. The levels of luxury and service the boomers considered marks of status we consider a birthright (climate control, computing, media). We also do virtually nothing to aid those who live on a fraction of even a minimum wage worker's  salary.

To be clear: The boomers are by no means a blameless generation. But at least they had the benefit of ignorance couples with fear. They thought their capitalist tendencies would eventually let the whole world experience the radical improvement in life that they experienced, they believed socialism was a dreaded disease that would swallow the world (and the kind they could see kinda made that hard to argue against.) They didn't have the internet to provide them with information to dispell on the inaccuracies and outright lies they believed. Fucks sake they didn't even have mythbusters or Bill Nye. They literally just tried to find a way to live in a world that hard nearly destroyed itself with war in their parents' living memories (and those parents had SEVERE untreated PTSD, so yeah they were abused en masse and thought it was normal).

They passed some shit sandwiches to us, but yelling ""bad boomers fucked us"" is simply refusing to accept the humanity of other humans. They had to rebuild a world that had bombed itself to shit and spent years on the edge of literal nuclear annihilation, due to the inability of their parents and grandparents to be rational. 

We have to back the planet down from the edge of economic and environmental annihilation now.  This will be the great struggle of our age, but we won't get there screaming at old people for not doing their generation's job and ours too. We all wish we didn't have to face the struggles of our age, but being pissed at people soon to die for actions that happened decades ago is simply worthless.

second there has been a negative feedback with firefighters and paramedic in some parts of france where local politics made it so that help was systematically slower to come and less efficient in poorer areas than the next door richer area, it seeded resentment and stupid violent acts, which led to emergency services being that much slower and reticent to work in what they believed to be potentially dangerous places and... well you see how it can turn to a spiral of shit real fast, and it did.

Note that those instances of emergency services being attacked are fairly rare (and inexcusable every single time) and that last I heard progress had been made to resolve some of those issues in some places but since systemic issues are not treated and only hot points are addressed I fear this will sadly stay a low key issue indefinitely.

121,"As I've repeatedly told you: No, we couldn't have used nuclear any more, we had to turn of the power plants for safety reasons. 

And commercial generation 3 nuclear power plants take 15-25 to build at least, the planning phase alone usually takes around 10 year, with certifications. You can't just plop down nuclear power plants wherever you want. And there's not a single company in Germany currently certified to build nuclear reactos anyway, so we would have to spend a few year to certify a company before we could start planning a new reactor. All these little details add up. And that's the problem with proponents of nuclear power, they never know about the details. Once you start to understand how many little details go into nuclear, it is no longer an attractive proposition. It's always the same. 


&gt; and weighing the benefits of nuclear power against its shortcomings and risks

That's what we've done. There's many shortcomings, a lot of risks and no benefit that renewables can't provide for a fraction of the cost. 

I get your point, that nuclear is better than coal, oil and gas. But it's also much, much more expensive than renewables, so every second we let nuclear plants run, we have to divert money from building more renewables. 

So if you think short-term, nuclear is a solution. If you think big picture and plan for the long term, renewables are the better bet.

&gt; What's happened in the last 20 years: Nuclear being replaced by renewables. Fossils fuels almost unchanged so that the country could keep up with the transition to intermittent renewables.

Again, the money we saved by turning off nuclear is one of the main reasons why renewable energy did so well

&gt; What should have happened in the last 20 years: Fossil fuels being replaced by renewals. Nuclear almost unchanged so that the country could keep up with the transition to intermitent renewables.

That would have been to expensive. None of the nuclear plants shut off would have been allowed to run until this year without heavy investments that we instead put into renewables. 

You can have either expensive nuclear, or use cheap coal to invest into clean, renewable sources.

If we had stuck with nuclear, we would have either had to invest much more money, or used much more gas and coal to offset the costs of nuclear.

After Edward's death he was briefly elected king, but he was barely 15 and too weak to hold onto power. He was still only 37 at the death of William the Conqueror. He'd initially been held as a prisoner by William and after various escapades attempting to win back the throne during William's reign he appears to have eventually given up and settled into being an advisor and ambassador for the Norman kings in the later 11th century. He was fairly useful for this as his sister was married to the king of Scotland. Unfortunately he had a habit of backing the wrong side, especially Robert Curthose. He was supposedly a naval commander during the First Crusade, and he was certainly still alive in 1125. It's thought that he died soon after this, although given that a contemporary record states that at this time he'd retreated to a quiet retirement on his estates for all we know he could have survived another decade or more. His wiki page is pretty interesting and has some references for him potentially living over 100, although that could also have been a son.

He's an interesting character. The idea of the last Saxon heir being still alive in the early 12th century and involved in the affairs of Henry I is bizarre. It must have been a strange dynamic and he'd have been oddly out of place. Did he learn to speak Norman French? That must have been pretty humiliating for the 'true' English king.

Were these feelings fostered by the government, who had their own ulterior economical reasons in mind? Most probably. But I want you to know that when people ask for Catalan independence, they're mostly thinking about protecting Catalan in school from the political parties that want to reduce it, they're thinking about making sure their culture perseveres despite the pressure of the bigger culturrs, and they're reacting against the hate that is directed towards Catalonia through the Spanish media and social networks.

249,"First of all, there's a difference between labour migration and refugee migration. Refugee migration is out of humanitarian concern and solidarity. Labour migration is out of economic need (whether that be from the side of business or government). If we look at labour migrants in the Netherlands, they have a higher labor force participation rate and lower unemployment rate than 'native' Dutch. Latinos migrate to the US for economic reasons mostly.

Second, the Dutch statistics are quite different from other countries because our right-wing parties fucked up our integration system to make sure no refugee can integrate easily. The less integration, the more votes they get. In Germany, Syrian refugees are two(!!!) times more likely to have a job by now than Syrian refugees in the Netherlands. And Germany's system still has room for improvement. The Dutch integration system does not in any way stimulate learning the language, getting a job or getting education. Refugees take a €10k loan from DUO and pay 3 years of language lessons for €5-6k a year. What signal is it giving to refugees that we make them pay €18000 to have the opportunity to learn the language?

The teaching institutions have been privatized, but because refugees are generally not capable of reading reviews or judging the quality of the company they're taking their lessons from, the quality of the courses has significantly declined ever since the right-wing nutjobs (which is, by the way, VVD, CDA, SGP and PVV) implemented this system. The result? Refugees barely speak the language anymore. The only people profiting from this are right-wing parties who mainly want people to be angry at refugees. And that's only the language course system. After refugees pass their entrance exams, they're pretty much left alone. No wonder they find it difficult to find work. If we actively supported refugees in attaining a high level of the Dutch language, Dutch cultural understanding, allowed for people to work in horeca on the side, gave them options for volunteering, made it possible for employees to work together with refugees with traineeships, recognized at least some diplomas from a country like Syria, etc, they would fare much much better and unemployment would be far lower. In such a case, refugees would be a net-win for the economy.

Third, it seems that more unemployed non-Dutch somehow leads to more employed Dutch. Let's say half the unemployed in the Netherlands right now are ethnically non-Dutch. Do you really think our unemployment rate would be half of what it is now if it weren't for migration, even when you consider that our unemployment rate is the lowest it's been in decades? The thing is that unemployed people also create jobs. They get government handouts, paid for by taxes, which they spend pretty much 100%. That spending creates jobs just as much if not more than it would if it were spent by the person who would've had to pay lower taxes. Higher taxes due to more hand-outs can lead to less people wanting to work, but, like I said before, it doesn't seem like higher refugee unemployment leads to higher total unemployment, as refugees unemployed create jobs for the rest.

If you want to know what the best political party for better integration, more refugee employment, stricter enforcement of refugee criteria, etc. is, then think about the party which, rationally speaking, has the most advantage from better refugee integration. The PVV has no advantage with refugee integration. Neither do, CDA or VVD. There's only two parties with a clear interest in getting proper integration if not assimilation for refugees, and those are PvdA and SP. And that corresponds with reality: those are the parties that want to invest in language centers, education, traineeships, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

I think it would be stupid to stop letting in refugees or migrants because our own system is designed to make refugees fail. Let's make out system work.

&gt;You're talking about two different regimes and you're also forgetting that you didn't fight Greece in that war. If Greece had entered the war there's a good chance you wouldn't have landed on the island in the first place.

I'm talking about the Greek Cypriot side. 

&gt;Of course then it would have been an all out war so there's a lot of ""what if's"". You don't agree with what Turkey did but you're trying to cover it up by saying the equivalent of ""yeah well if you didn't want to get shot maybe you shouldn't have punched me"". The Greek junta was fucked but one illegal act doesn't justify another, especially when Turkey's policy is prolonged and your country still supports and carries it on.

I could say the same thing about you, you're covering for what the Greek side did. Cyprus was independent and free of occupiers, why wasn't that enough? So you deposed the government and started to massacre Turkish Cypriots. To what end? What was the end goal here? 
And now you want to act like you didn't depose an independent Cypriot government and you didn't attack the other side. ""Just withdraw the troops and we can go back to after the moment you deposed Makarios.""


&gt;I will repeat myself. Equal status will be given for Turkish Cypriots citizens, not the thousands of settlers that you brought from mainland Turkey to alter the island's demographics. If you want thousands of Turkish settlers to have equal status with Greek and Turkish Cypriots you're fooling yourself.

They're were no settlers on 1974. And the constitution did provide equal status. If the Greek side supports all that then why did you depose the government? 

&gt;The Annan plan of 2004 was going well and was to be accepted until Turkey asked for some absurd changes that would only benefit Turkey literally in the last minute and the UN had to proceed with that plan cause their deadline was running out nad they wanted to finish with the Cyprus issue hastily in order to proceed with Turkey's EU accession talks. The new terms were basically ridiculous and couldn't be accepted by the Greek Cypriot side. Again, it was the Turkish side that altered the plan in the last moment.

Yeah that's the cover story. But the reality is that the Southern Cyprus was to join the EU anyway, so they thought why accept this deal when we can instead block Turkey's accession to the EU for a better deal. 

&gt; Cyprus is an independent nation and it will be able to decide what's best for it and its citizens.

Right and in 1974 they decided to get rid of the government, get rid of equal status for Turks and in the end perhaps get rid of the Turk. Your words are empty. There's 0 reason for the Turkish side to trust you when you have shown zero regret for past actions and instead just wail about Turkey. 

&gt;The Turkish Cypriot citizens will have equal status but will be fewer (which isn't that absurd. That's how things were to begin with.. ) if you think that you can send thousands of settlers from Turkey in order to boost a minority's number and that's okay, then i'm not the one being unreasonable here. If that's the case then let Greece send 100.000 more people in Cyprus, name them Greek Cypriots and become a majority artificially. Of course you wouldn't be okay with that.

You keep bringing up settlers. But there were 0 settlers in 1974. 

Like I said you want Cyprus to be a Greek state with minority status. Saying equal before the law means zilch. The Turkish side doesn't want to live in a Greek state. They want to live in a multi ethnic state. 


&gt;Again, if you guys only have the coast and 2 islands and we have over 2000 islands in the Aegean, why are you disagreeing with 95% ? What would you like, 25%? And how would you justify that number? Based on what territory? We have WAY more territory and access all around the Aegean than you have.

How many of those 2000 are even inhabitable? They're little rocks out in the sea. You seek to own all of the Aegean based on barren rocks. 
And I'm not even hung up on that. Let Greece declare 12 miles. But it would be nice if they didn't for the islands that turn the Turkish territorial waters into tiny disconnected bubbles. Basically Turkey can't move its fleet without permission from Greece. 


&gt;Of course you're pursuing your interest but that doesn't say much. In your scenario of the Cyprus issue which you explained above, you said that Greece wants to have the Turkish Cypriots as a minority under its boots. It's not true but if it was, wouldn't that also be pursuing our interests? Why are you protesting against? Everyone is pursuing their interests but we're talking about reasonable things here. Turkey could be pursuing its interests and claiming Athens but you understand how retarded that would be.

Because you're acting like Turkey's behavior is super alien and unreasonable. 

&gt;To use your own argument from earlier about Cyprus: ""Maybe you should have thought about what might happen before going to war?"" :P

500,"&gt; Oh so different people have different rights. 

... yes? Compare the gun situation in America and Spain.

&gt; This mentality allows for so many diverse and creative ways to generate discrimination that i will not even try to list them.

More like too lazy to do it.

&gt;  So many countries fail to recognize a plethora of basic human rights and penalize various freedoms. Does that mean that their citizens don't deserve those rights, aren't these rights being violated? Of course they are. How can this happen? Well, because what is legal has absolutely nothing to do with what is right or ethical.

yadda yadda imaginary scenarios, stay on point.

&gt; If I, a catalan, violate your rights by voting in a referendum for the catalan independence from spain without you, who lives in a different part of spain, then the rights of the uk and canadians were violated when their referendums happened.

From my perspective they were, but like I've said many times different systems different constitutions. Look at Belgium, their Constitution doesn't allow secession either.

&gt; And fun fact, to have those rights recognized, our ancestors broke a shitton of laws. Like, a lot.

This is my **favorite** point, you are capable of realizing that our fathers fought to have a democratic country. They succeeded and now like a normal democracy we have separations of power, that means that the judicial side checks the legislative one in case politicians go rogue which is exactly what's happened.

Also if people who break the law under a fascist regime are heroes what do you call people who break the law under a democracy.

&gt; Yeah sure the remainders of the dictatorship that formed a party and their friends are not fascists at all.

Grow up, our constitution was written by communists too. It's a beautiful common effort for a better and fairer country for everyone between a wildly different political spectrum.

That's why I said this:

&gt;*Now this redditor may not be ultra-right, or may not know he is, but that above is exactly their discourse.*

This is fun: 

&gt;But you will find many people who vote for leftist parties who frontally reject the idea of independence.

Do you know a running joke among pro-indy catalan supporters? *The closes thing to a Spanish right-winger is a Spanish left-winger*. Mate, we are very aware we have zero support among Spaniards because for Spanish people this is an ethnic conflict (hence the constant attacks against our language, education, culture, etc etc), while for us it's a self-determination conflict.

&gt;The idea of unfairness in the electoral vote stems from the fact that regionalist and independentist parties have, for many years, held so much power over the central government. Think about the PNV and their economic demands for the Basque Country in exchange for their vote to Pedro Sánchez. That extra money alloted to them just for those votes does not come from thin air; it is given to them to the detriment of other regions that cannot negotiate in the same terms because they don't have the same representative power

So people in *other regions* (sic) decide to vote Madrid-centric parties and they get surprised and angry when those parties don't look after them? COLOUR ME SURPRISED MATEY.

&gt;And here I'm shitting on the central governments, right or left, who have allowed this to happen for their sole benefit. People are pissed off in every region, I promise you.

Self-inflicted damage mate. The Basque and the Catalans have decided to vote for parties that look after them, because otherwise no one else does.

You have to make the correction in the same place you made the accusations. You can't just drop a ""oh yeah my bad"" down the collapsed thread where no one will see it. That's how you spread misinformation mate.

&gt;Your reasoning is like saying that all regions should have outrageous demands that should be considered or else they separate from Spain, right? 

Your question is loaded because you're branding any decentralisation request as *outrageous*.

&gt;That poorer regions are poor because they don't pressure the government enough with some bullshit. That is not a good thing in any country.

That's exactly the definition of democracy and compromise mate. Look it up. 

Did you know that e.g. in the UK we elect around 600 MPs,  so your local MP is for a small area? Did you know that many people vote based on how their local MP has supported their local needs during the last term?

&gt;And, although it might surprise you, there are people who like being part of Spain (and they are not fascists for it!).

Nobody said people that like Spain are fascists. Fascists actually dislike Spain, they just want a MegaMadriz. Nothing wrong with Madrid, but Madrid is Madrid and Huelva is Huelva, not Madrid.

My mother in law has always said she's Spanish first and catalan second. She wants to be able to vote and give her voice. She doesn't feel that the police beating up separatists are her voice at all. She is disgusted by it. She, like many others would happily have voted to stay in Spain. Now, she's not sure. 

Through making the vote illegal, not allowing voices to be heard, Spain is simply making the divisions bigger. Each time the police hit a protester, another person will want independence. Doing what Spain is doing is not going to work, it won't silence the resentment. You can't beat someone into compliance. You'll have to kill them, that's what Franco did and Spain is better than that thankfully. 

I love Spain, and I love catalonia. They have more in common than they have differences. For me as kind of an outsider, it is horrible to see this situation. Giving them the freedom to choose is soon going to be the only peaceful option left. We've already seen the police enforcing the non peaceful.

Wanting independence is not an attack on Spain or the Spanish. Nor is wanting the freedom to vote. To you it probably seems like it, but honestly it is not.

I think there are 2 reasons: other countries within the EU have secessionist movements too; and mainstream political parties are pro-EU, they don't want a balkanized Europe, it's already very difficult to get things moving forward politically with 27 voices, imagine if you multiply those voices by 2 or 3.

As a spaniard I agree with you, trying to stop the referendum with the police was really poor. I'm also in favour of a proper referendum, I understand there is a deadlock that needs a solution, but maybe you are not aware of how aggressive separatist leaders have been in their strategy. They ignored Spanish law, which I guess means something if we don't want to be a banana republic. They unilaterally declared independence without even having 50% of the votes for the Catalan Parliament, what about the rest of Catalans, fuck them? They did all this with extreme urgency, Catalan governments started pushing for a referendum barely 10 years ago. Why all this urgency and disruption when you already have a fairly high degree of autonomy, including full control of public schools and media. Nationalism has skyrocketed during the last 10 years, keep pushing your agenda in the schools and you'll reach easily 60% of support in the next 5 or 10 years, and keep pushing politically for more autonomy without ignoring the law. Instead they pushed throw the limit like if Catalonia is in some kind of oppression, big companies moved their headquarters to other regions because of the instability, social division, etc, ... independentist leaders acted like populists.

The ""problem"" with the term ""indigenous"" is that while it does include most ethnic groups in Europe, it primarily used in discussions about indigenous groups of an entirely different character, with different problems and mostly in the New World. Why I did write it was because of my own country - the right of self-determination shouldn't apply to foreign immigrants, who are not indigenous people of that land. Otherwise it would be rather easy to abuse that right - invade a country, implant your population there, and then claim the right to self-determination for them - that was never intended to be the purpose of that right.

766,"&gt;Catalan is   
&gt;  
&gt;one  
&gt;  
&gt; of the languages of Catalunya. Don't forget that.

Catalan is literally ""the language of the Catalans"" and this is written in the Estatut, which gets its validation from the Spanish Constitution.

And there are laws guaranteeing that Catalans should be able to interact with their government in their own language.

The Spanish Constitution says Spanish is the official language in the whole of Spain and that Spaniards have the duty to know it, which means it is illegal for a Spaniard to not know Spanish, so you can't get a job in public admin without knowing Spanish. Not doing so for Catalan in Catalonia is discrimination. You twisting the facts to make it discrimination against those who don't speak Catalan is actually the act of a fascist pig. If you're not a fascist pig, and I'll give you that I'm angry and tired of being discriminated, you should think long and hard about your words.

&gt;Your England comparison doesn't make sense.

It does. English is the language of the English people.

&gt;Welsh would be a better comparison, and depending on the role (customer facing or not) Welsh is required or advised.

I, sadly, don't know the state of Welsh laws regarding language.

&gt;But forcing languages on people never works, it has to be a choice.

It's not forced. It's a requirement to do your job right. The funny thing is that in many positions knowing Catalan gives you extra points when applying for those roles, while in all public administration roles throughout the whole of Spain not knowing Spanish immediately disqualifies you for the role. The only language that's actually *forced* is Spanish. The ability to understand your citizens in Catalan is indeed required for public facing roles such as police, doctors or judges (apart from more clerical jobs). You're not forced to reply in Catalan (unless you realise the other person is not understanding you), but you are required to understand Catalan enough to understand most Catalan speakers and not need to often request them to switch.",,/r/europe/comments/dhrl1l/airport_of_barcelona_right_now_following_the/f3trk7o/,CloudNetworkingIO,1571144237

&gt; A state that they feel represented in, in the current political enviroment its often seen as the spanish goverment looks only after the benefit of castilian people.

You used ""it's seen"" - but can this be said objectively? It could be understand that Spanish government may feel more inclined toward Spain as Catalonia, while significant is still only 6th part of Spain. (a bit of devil's advocate here)

&gt; too concerned about topics that feel they are not related to catalonia nor should be part of a discussion in the 21st century.

This is also slightly connected with previous point (1/6th) but also - what about Spain is not progressive and what about Catalonia is? What laws would Catalonian people would like to see (especially those progressive) that are currently actively blocked by Spanish government?

&gt; Being represented in the international comunity, when catalans go aborad they are often treated yas if they were castilians, and it often seems than in the world of nations states you need a state for your nationality to be treated like any other.

OK, but this seems to be more related with ""marketing"" isn't it? And ignorance of the world (you would be surprised how many times I, as a Pole abroad, surprised people that no, I don't speak Russian...)

&gt; Yes the languange is being revived inside the country but it is nowhere near as normalized as any other european language are.

Would you like to have Catalan as one of the official languages of the EU?

Ireland has quite similar problem with their Gaelic and it's not going that well. I think people are also quite ""utilitarian"" (in their case English has more benefits, Spanish would seem as well). But I'm also quite weird in that area and I'd argue that adopting Esperanto as universal second-language in whole EU would be an awesome idea ;-)

&gt; While in europe for example the survival of the polish culture should never be determined by who rules in germany.

OK, now you touched on the important point and something that slightly 'unhinges' me. You see Catalan independent claim they are oppressed (which was true to some degree in the past, especially during Franco) but nowadays both in Polonia and Catalunia we both have freedom to enjoy our language and culture without much of the limitation. Do you think that going full independent instead of enshrining total independence of catalan language in culture in Spanish legislature wouldn't be better solution? That way you would avoid any future thread to region (culture wise) and would benefit from being part of larger entity?

&gt; Catalonia is a small nation and money is one of the few tools catalans have to fight, taking some away from them even if it is little its seen a threat to their national security.

OK, I asked this in separate comment but I'll repeat: Catalonia is also pro-EU, which has same mentality: rich regions support development of poorer regions so they, as one, can be stronger together. Would Catalonia after separation and (well, unlikely but for the sake of argument) joining EU oppose such subsidies?

834,"&gt; It’s bad faith to say that part of rites is allowed so they can theoretically continue their religion. A religion is not a market where you choose which piece you want, that’s why it’s a belief, a faith. You give yourself to a whole. 

The rites are allowed, as long as it does not go against the law and principles of the country for the good sake of a united society. Are you considering that we should tolerate everything because it could hurt someone in practicing its religion everywhere everytime ? Stupid example, but what about a religion who would require me to live naked ? I  could go everywhere anytime naked right ?

Living in society is not for someone putting religion above all, you've got monastery for this.

&gt; Trying to take the authority on a call about their own business is just the final nail polemist found to insult them in their face/faith. 

Then why are we letting this practice clearly pushed by fundamentalists ? They're not relevant either to judge and we shall protect people from them

&gt; Are you really free when *it costs* you to practice your religion? When you must stand pains and humiliations publicly? 

Are you aware of the concept itself or religion ? I mean ...

&gt; Of course it is true, of course the religious freedom is a fallacy in the muslim case. That’s what I have been arguing in all my other paragraph.

Please provide proof of what you're saying ? How is it prevented to be a muslim in France ?

&gt; First, you start by saying that the practice of a religion is a community based claim. Is a community based claim illegal? Or has the Republic decided to forbid to have the same opinions? 

Not illegal, but below the interests of the Republic that is first and foremost indivisible, secular, democratic and social. It does not ignore cults, but do not recognize them.

Have you heard of Zineb el Rhazoui, 'Femmes sans voile' collective ? Indeed it is not big, why ? Because this is something new as we had a generation of muslim women who knew the pain of being forcibly veiled and the degradation of women rights linked to this.

&gt; And you implying that women are more probe to domestic violence by Muslims is obscurantist and based on nothing 

How did I imply that ? but if you want to discuss about it, please have a look at the countries trying to get a hand on France's muslim communities, you know, Iran, Saoudi Arabia, indeed, paradise for women rights.

&gt; I never heard the Republic congratulate the Muslim communities for embracing such progressive views, how come?

1225,"There was no reason to remove those elements of that Catalan Statue after it had been approved by both Catalan and Spanish Parliaments and endorsed by the Catalan people in a referendum. 

The Statute of Autonomy is the most important law in Spain after the Constitution. It'is a very important issue for the political organization of Spain. Never in the history of Spain has happened something like what happened with the Catalan Statute, with the Constitutional Court (controlled by a PP majority) changed what had been agreed and endorsed. And the PP collecting signatures throughout Spain against the Catalans. It was a horrible propaganda campaign by PP, nothing else. How can we accept that these same elements get removed from the Catalan Statue but are accepted in Andalusia or Balearic Islands Statues? Why can't Catalonia have what the other regions do? Like look at [this](https://elpais.com/diario/2007/07/05/espana/1183586424_850215.html).

The current socialist president of the Balearic Islands, that drafted current Balearic Islands Statue, explained it herself: ""[we copied the articles of Catalonia's Statue for our new Balearic islands statue, but PP didn't appeal ours simply because we weren't the Catalan problem](https://twitter.com/F_Armengol/status/1061741292294733825)"".

In Europe at least, the socio-demographic profile of many poles after 2004 is not any different from that of the turks. While some highly educated also went, the bulk came from poorer sections (plumber, carpenters, construction workers, service workers in restaurants etc, etc). So I don't think it can be explained by that either. 

Is it rapid assimilation? But then US and Canadian ones would have turned left/liberal, too.

1243,"I mean, we know we suck, right? It’s not like whatever criticism we have been reading about our country for the past few weeks on Reddit was news to us. But what they are failing to consider is the fact that Erdogan government did not just magically appear out of thin air; but had the full and active support of United States and EU in their early years - even though his views on democracy were well documented for us. So when you read these kind of threads and comments you can’t help but feel a bit disappointed because we knew, right? We have been telling these over a decade now but nobody cared until it became a part of “oh-let’s shit-on-Turkey-because-of-Syria” bandwagon.

I think what many people in the West mischaracterizes about us is the fact that not every thing is black and white as they seem to them. We are not simply daft people who blindly supports every policy decision made by the government. But when Europe wags their finger and scolds us for all the bad shit the government has done, it does not sit well with our inherent inferiority complex to impress them because being a part of West is engraved in the foundation of Republic. And, considering from a historical point of view, we are still a young Republic trying to find its identity and course. So I think when we are judged harshly by our Western counterparts, it just is not helpful. It only puts us in a more defensive point of view and plays into the hands of nationalists who would constantly remind us that Turkey has no friends other than herself. 

So, to go the opening sentence, it is not “we” that who sucks but our current government. And they will not be around for the whole time. There is already a huge backlash to them for the last few years and it will gain a lot more momentum in the next elections.

It's far from being true. Seriously, don't believe the lies that some Spanish nationalist parties say. People who have never been to a Catalan school.

&gt; The Statute of Autonomy asked for impossible things, like a completely independent judiciary system. That is just ridiculous.

This is also false. Why on Earth would PSOE, which had a majority in Catalan parliament and was the ruling party at that time, and then the Spanish Parliament approve a Catalan Statue of Autonomy with such thing? The Statue of Autonomy didn't include impossible things at all, which is why it was approved by both the Catalan and Spanish Parliaments.

The PP copied the articles of the Catalan Statues for other Statues, like the Andalusian one, while at the same time they sent those Catalan articles to the Court. The Catalan Statue articles were nullified by the Spanish Constitutional Court, while the Andalusian copies weren't. It was just a big propaganda campaign from PP, to win more votes in the rest of Spain. With the anti-Catalan message.

&gt; And why would you force people from outside of Catalonia to learn Catalan when basically 99% of Catalonians can speak Spanish? It's a waste of time and money.

Well now you see why there's a problem. Catalans want to use their language, since it's Catalonia's own language according to the law. If Spanish public servants working in Catalonia can't speak in Catalan, then Catalan citizens can't address to them in such language.

1291,"*Goes looking for an etymology*

https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/whiskey-and-whisky-and-alchemy

&gt; The 15th century alchemists who first used the term *aqua vitae* were doing so to refer to distilled spirits. They were searching for immortality (in addition to wealth and longevity) and must have settled on the name a dram or two shy of overindulgence. (To be fair, it's likely that it was less euphoric drunkenness that made them choose the name than the substance's medicinal properties.) Their Latin borrowing has endured in English: *aqua vitae* is still a generic (and seldom used) term for a strong alcoholic liquor, like brandy.
&gt;
&gt;*Whiskey* (as it's typically spelled in the United States; more on *whiskey*/*whisky* below) is the modern version of the Hiberno-Scots take on *aqua vitae*. It's a shortening of earlier *whiskeybae* and *usquebaugh*, among many other variants, all of which are borrowed from either Irish *uisce beathadh* or Scottish Gaelic *uisge beatha* and refer to a drink traditionally distilled from malted barley.
&gt;
&gt;*Aqua vitae* inspired coinages in other languages as well: *aquavit* (also styled as *akvavit*), a Swedish, Danish, and Norwegian take on *aqua vitae*, refers to a clear Scandinavian liquor flavored with caraway seeds; *eau-de-vie*, which refers to a clear brandy distilled from the fermented juice of pears, raspberries, or other fruit, is a French translation of the term.
&gt;
&gt; Now about that spelling: is your local hipster bar using ""whisk(e)y"" as a category heading on its menu because it looks cool, or is there a distinction that requires parenthetical diplomacy to be accurately inclusive? Well, *whiskey* is the usual spelling in the U.S. and Ireland, while *whisky* is the usual spelling everywhere else. The labels on bottles will typically reflect the spelling favored in the land from which they hail—though some American bourbons align themselves more with scotch and use *whisky*.",🇺🇸 United States of America,/r/europe/comments/dhojse/wto_formally_backs_us_tariffs_on_eu_goods/f3sxvmy/,duisThias,1571112016

Indeed, I'm not, which is why I reject your aimless, sourceless blathering.

&gt; That's kinda hot as far as literotica goes tbh!

Really? Who let you out of the zoo anyway?

&gt; Ableist much?

So you admit it? 

&gt; Read up some literature

You don't read anything. You don't know what literature is, and by the looks of the harebrained pseudohistorical platitudes you're spewing, you haven't had much of an education either.

&gt; Sucks to be the guy who invented the word 'murder'. 

Murder is a legal concept. You can't lecture about it in primitive societies where it doesn't exist. 

Now, what's amusing here, is to see you helplessly go for increasingly reductionist semantics until you've found a term sufficiently deprived of complexity that knowing or not no longer matters. The fact of the matter remains that you put a term in Marx' hands that did not exist at the time, on top of *misapplying it entirely*, since Marx never advocated violence against a specific ethnicity to begin with, let along that being counterrevolutionary is a political *choice*, not a fucking ethnicity.

This isn't merely a single failure - it's a massive, *compound failure* in attempting to convey a laughable falsehood. You **failed**, and your squirming as you fail to grasp the nuances of modern political semantics is highly entertaining. 

&gt; ""All other big and small tribes and peoples have the mission to perish in the revolutionary world-storm"" [etc. etc.]

For *Engels* to allude to a possible ""next world war"", which *might result* in a catastrophic defeat of counterrevolutionaries (see, this is where your ""unrevolutionary"" nonsense fails, it's *counter*revolutionary), is bellicose revolutionary rhetoric, not a statement of intent that Engels is going to make an extermination happen. Which is why the full German text is necessary, not your Google translated (I got **one** google hit on some forum, and the poster claimed to have used Google translate, heh), cherry picked mess.

1) ""Of all the nations and monasteries of Austria, only three are the bearers of progress who have actively intervened in history, which are still viable - the Germans, the Poles, the Magyars . Therefore, they are now revolutionary. All other big and small tribes and peoples have the mission to perish in the revolutionary world-storm. Therefore they are now counterrevolutionary.""

Context:

&gt; Die ganze frühere Geschichte Östreichs beweist es bis auf diesen Tag, und das Jahr 1848 hat es bestätigt. Unter allen den Nationen und Natiönchen Östreichs sind nur drei, die die Träger des Fortschritts waren, die aktiv in die Geschichte eingegriffen haben, die noch jetzt lebensfähig sind - die Deutschen, die Polen, die Magyaren. Daher sind sie jetzt revolutionär.

&gt; Alle andern großen und kleinen Stämme und Völker haben zunächst die Mission, im revolutionären Weltsturm unterzugehen. Daher sind sie jetzt kontrerevolutionär.

2) ""These remnants of a nation which, as Hegel says, are relentlessly trodden down by the course of history, these peoples' trashes are always, and remain until their utter obliteration or denationalization, the fanatical vehicles of counterrevolution, as their whole existence is in itself a protest against a great historical revolution.""

Context:

&gt; Es ist kein Land in Europa, das nicht in irgendeinem Winkel eine oder mehrere Völkerruinen besitzt, Überbleibsel einer früheren Bewohnerschaft, zurückgedrängt und unterjocht von der Nation, welche später Trägerin der geschichtlichen Entwicklung wurde. Diese Reste einer von dem Gang der Geschichte, wie Hegel sagt, unbarmherzig zertretenen Nation, diese Völkerabfälle werden jedesmal und bleiben bis zu ihrer gänzlichen Vertilgung oder Entnationalisierung die fanatischen Träger der Kontrerevolution, wie ihre ganze Existenz überhaupt schon ein Protest gegen eine große geschichtliche Revolution ist.

&gt; So in Schottland die Gälen, die Stützen der Stuarts von 1640 bis 1745.

&gt; So in Frankreich die Bretonen, die Stützen der Bourbonen von 1792 bis 1800.

&gt; So in Spanien die Basken, die Stützen des Don Carlos.


3)  ""The next world war will not only turn into reactionary classes and dynasties, it will also make entire reactionary peoples disappear from the ground. And that's also progress.""

The problem is that there is no lie going arround in Spain saying that Madrid is extremely overrepresented in Spanish parliament, but lots and lots of Spaniards are 100% convinced Catalan parties are extremely overrepresented in Spanish parliament, which is absolutely false. One more of the lies explained agaisnt us. Truth is some minority Spanish parties are extremely underrepresented and Spanish majority parties are extremely overrepresented. Examples:

Large all-Spain party

* PSOE: 28,67% votes - 123 MP (35,14%)

28,7% votes, 35,1% of MPs

Medium all-Spain parties

* PP: 19, 69% votes - 66 MP (18,85%)
* Cs: 15,86% votes - 57 MP (16,28%)

35,5% votes, 35% MPs

Small all-Spain parties

* UP: 11,06% votes - 33 MP (9,42%)
* Vox: 10,26% votes -  24 MP (6,85%)

21,3% votes, 16,3% MPs

Strictly Catalan Parties

* ERC: 3,89% votes - 15 MP (4,2%)
* ECP: 2,35% votes -  7 MP (2%)
* JxCat: 1,91% votes - 7 MP (2%)

Slightly over 8% of votes, slightly over 8% of MPs

But they have been made to believe it's not the large all-Spain parties the overrepresented ones, but the Catalan ones!!!!

They are told ERC+JxCat have 22 MPs with less than 6% of votes, Vox has 24 MPs with over 10% of votes, so it means Catalans are overrepresented!!!!!

Catalonia didn't get any investment nor protective policies from the Spanish government.

No. It got rid of the Double Irish loophole in 2015, but it's claimed by some biased media sources that it simply switched to the ""single malt"" loophole because linkedln was found to be using it in 2017 and teflex in 2018. and they also claim that BEPS tools are still used after an uptick in 2015,  What they failed to mention was that within the legislation all multinationals will become tax resident in Ireland when it finishes taking full effect in 2020 which will render them ineffective, in 2017 tax relief was capped for capital allowances which restored the effective tax rate and in 2018 tax treaties where further amended to end BEPS restructuring.

&gt;Technically correct. In reality, not really.

That doesn't mean anything, elaborate. Sales outside the state where considered tax due to the country where the company was headquartered, no tax evasion scheme existed in Ireland without eliminating the funds to an *actual* tax haven such as bermuda, cayamans etc.

1465,"&gt;Parotting Youtube videos is not, in any way, a substitute for credentialed historical sources and academics. You don't even speak German.

&gt;The NSDAP never had a ""socialist wing"", just like the ""DPRK"" never had a ""democratic wing"".

&gt;You can prove right now that you actually know what you are babbling about by telling me what the antonym of ""Nazi"" was at the time.

You can deny it all you want, but it's the simple truth. I'd suggest rereading your academic literature if you still fail to understand.

Also, I have it on good authority from several socialist literature and intellectuals that the DPRK has regular, democratic elections so I'm not sure that what you're saying is true.

&gt;Is this ridiculous leading question supposed to be a substitute for historical evidence? Socialism and communism were different movements and their rivalry even in Weimar Germany was fierce. And then even communism and stalinism aren't identical.

I mean, historical evidence says it all. Mao, Pol Pot, Stalin, Lenin, whatever sicko lead the Derg, they were all spawn of the socialist ideology. That is, socialism is the foundation for the justifications the use to hang poor people from street lamps.

&gt;You might as well claim libertarianism and conservatism are nondistinct. It's rhetorically-tinged sophist hogwash designed to ascribe atrocities from one movement to the other when rhetorically convenient. And you know it.

Y'know what they say, conservatives of today were the neolibs of yesterday or something like that.

&gt;""Socialists"" are communists when it suits you, and then Nazis again when it suits you.

They're pretty much the same for me all the time. If you're going to go around and commit ethnic cleansing on minorities while using your ideology to justify it, then your ideology is the same genocidal hogshite as the other genocidal ideologies. Simple as that.

&gt;Not only did the term ""ethnic cleansing"" not exist at the time, ""unrevolutionary"" (not a word they ever used) isn't an ""ethnicity"". Jfc.

That's kinda like saying gravity didn't exist before the 16th century because the word wasn't invented until then lol. You say it wasn't about ethnicity, but when you single out specific national identities to be eradicated it's kinda ethnic-cleansingy.

&gt;Is this... an attempt to undermine your own point?

I'll leave it up to interpretation, a true poet never explains the meaning behind their art.

&gt;Stalin had no choice but to establish a non-aggression pact with the Nazis until his army was even remotely capable of fighting them. They still weren't ready when they were subsequently invaded - a clear sign that they were never ""alliies"" in the slightest - just two regional powers deciding briefly not to attack, and then doing it anyway.

&gt;The Soviets then sacrificed rivers of blood fighting the Nazis while Churchill sat twiddling his thumbs, admiring the spectacle, knowing full well the brutal war would weaken both his enemies, only deciding to intervene directly, with American and Canadian help, at the latest possible time before Germany would be lost to the Soviets entirely. The only appeal the Americans can make to intervention is the Lend-Lease program, but contrary to public perception, the Soviets' native tank production vastly outnumbered American industrial support, and as we know from the Hitler taps in Finland, constituted Hitler's worst nightmare.

Lmao. The USSR didn't have enough troops to fight the Nazis but it had plenty enough to conquer and occupy Poland as well as the Baltic states, must be some commie magic. If you can spare the manpower to brutally occupy half of an entire country and orchestrate acts of ethnic cleansing in it, then you have enough manpower to fight off the Nazis.

If we're talking about twiddling thumbs, the Soviets were the experts of sitting around doing fuckall while others perished for their hubris. It was the Soviets, after all, who coordinated the occupations of sovereign countries with the Nazis and brokered a pact with them, even going as far as to organise joint parades in occupied cities. It was also the Soviets who waited until Warsaw was reduced to 90% rubble by the Nazis because they preferred dead Poles to independent ones.

1550,"On average, the prison sentences of the coup were 6 years, while those of the 'procés' amount to 8.3 per sentenced.

&amp;#x200B;

Comparing the figures of this trial with those applied to those convicted of the coup d'etat of 23-F, the jail sentences issued this Monday by the Supreme Court are equal to those of the coup or even greater. It is a condemnation of less striking dimensions, because in this way that of the 'procés' equals or even exceeds the scope of the wielding against those responsible for law enforcement for breaking into the Congress of Deputies and mobilizing the tanks in the streets of cities like Valencia in order to end the country's democratic regime.

With the sentence of 13 years in prison for the leader of ERC Oriol Junqueras at the head and penalties not less than 9 years, several Twitter users have taken advantage to illustrate this comparison in the networks, as is the case of Hibai Arbide Aza. An exercise of retroactive contextualization that leaves a strong data uncovered: only three convicted of the 33 exceed the condemnation of Junqueras.

Analyzing both sentences in more depth, the comparison only becomes more bleeding. On average, the prison sentences of 23-F were 6 years, while those of the 'procés' amount to 8.3 per sentenced. Not counting the courts that did not face prison sentences, three fined in the current trial and three acquitted in 1983, only seven coup plotters were sentenced to prison sentences greater than the lower of those belonging to the 'procés' trial (9 years ).

In addition to the three leaders responsible for the coup - Milans del Bosch, Antonio Tejero and Alfonso Armada - who received a 30-year prison sentence, only Commander Ricardo Pardo Zancada (sentenced to 12 years in prison), General Luis Torres Rojas (12 years old) and Colonels Diego Ibáñez Inglés (10 years old) and José Ingancio San Martín López (10 years old) had sentences of more than 9 years in prison, the lowest within those of the 'procés'. The remaining 26 coup leaders received sentences of eight, six, five, three, two or a year.

&amp;#x200B;

Those responsible did not comply with the full sentence

Once the sentence is passed, it is now possible to verify the possible differences that may occur when serving prison sentences between the defendants, something that is not yet known with certainty how it will happen in the case of the 'process'. On the other hand, none of the three responsible for the coup d'etat served more than half of their initial sentence.

&amp;#x200B;

Milans de Bosch was released in July 1991, when he was granted probation by article 60 of the civil prison regulations after serving 75 years. Therefore, he served about eight years in jail.

Alfonso Armada Comyn, whose sentence was reduced to 26 years in prison by the Supreme Council of Military Justice, was pardoned in 1988, thus serving five years of internment.

Antonio Tejero was the one who spent the most time in jail. In total, he was more than thirteen years old, obtaining the right to release in 1996. In this way, Junqueras, who has already been in pretrial detention since November 2017, could spend more years in jail than the three maximum responsible for the 23-F if you end up serving your full sentence. At the moment, it is still pending to know how they will comply with these sentences or if they will have access to the third grade.",Earth,/r/europe/comments/dhwxq2/only_three_convicted_of_23f_had_greater_penalties/f3rbwl4/,TheGabnor,1571086538

If a big majority of people really want this is, they should be able to vote in a party or a coalition of parties that run on “an independence referendum” as their main program point. If such a coalition wins with a very clear majority, they should then demand the government (Spain) organizes the referendum (not the local government). Spain might demand a 2/3rds majority for independence is needed, which is not crazy! Independence would be highly disruptive, which is why its only justified if a big enough majority of Catalans want it!

1640,"The article behind the paywall: 

Ankara’s radical proxies are also apparently executing Kurdish prisoners and killing unarmed civilians, videos show. 

As Turkey wages a violent campaign  against Kurdish fighters and civilians across northeastern Syria,  Turkish-backed proxy forces with ties to extremist groups are deliberately releasing detainees affiliated with the Islamic State from unguarded prisons, two U.S. officials confirmed to *Foreign Policy*. 

The claim pours cold water on U.S.  President Donald Trump’s suggestion on Twitter that the Syrian Kurdish  fighters tasked with guarding the prisons released the detainees to grab  U.S. attention after the Defense Department ordered all U.S. troops to  evacuate the region.

Backed by Turkey, the Free Syrian  Army, a decentralized band of Syrian rebels that has been linked to  extremist groups, has launched a bloody assault on northeastern Syria, [executing Kurdish prisoners](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/12/world/middleeast/turkey-invasion-syria-kurds.html) and killing scores of unarmed civilians and Kurdish fighters with the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). 

Over the weekend, a group of Turkish-backed forces ambushed a [female Kurdish politician](https://www.timesofisrael.com/kurdish-politician-among-9-civilians-killed-by-turkey-backed-rebels-monitor/) driving on the M4, the main highway through Syria and Iraq, forced her from the car, and killed her.

The group even deliberately targeted  U.S. troops in Kobani on Friday, two U.S. officials, speaking on  background to discuss sensitive operations, said separately. On Oct. 11,  Pentagon spokesman Capt. Brook DeWalt confirmed reports that U.S.  troops there had come under artillery fire from Turkey, adding that they  were unharmed. 

“It is not a mistake,” one senior U.S. administration official said. “They are trying to push us out.” 

Now as Turkey captures territory from  the SDF, the Free Syrian Army, also known as the Turkey-supported  opposition (TSO), is deliberately releasing Islamic State detainees  previously held by the Kurdish fighters, U.S. officials say.

Turkey used [video footage](https://news.mb.com.ph/2019/10/14/turkey-accuses-kurdish-forces-of-freeing-is-prisoners-in-syria/)  of an empty prison in the Syrian border town of Tal Abyad to  claim—without evidence—that the SDF deliberately released the detainees  before fleeing the Turkish assault.

“Turkish forces raided a prison in  Tal Abyad earlier today, expecting to take custody of Daesh terrorists  held there,” a senior government official told Turkish media, according  to reports. Daesh is an Arabic acronym for the Islamic State. 

“Before they got there, PKK/YPG  terrorists set free the Daesh militants in an attempt to fuel chaos in  the area,” the official said, claiming that no doors in the prison had  been broken. Turkey considers the SDF to be an offshoot of the Kurdistan  Workers’ Party (PKK) and the People’s Protection Units (YPG). 

Trump waded into the information war  on Monday, tweeting that the “Kurds may be releasing some \[Islamic State  prisoners\] to get us involved”—an accusation that U.S. officials said  is baseless. 

“That has enraged our forces in  Syria,” the senior U.S. administration official said. “Kurds are still  defending our bases. Incredibly reckless and dishonest thing to say.”

Another U.S. official said the SDF  has not abandoned the prisons—in fact, the group has moved some  detainees to facilities further south. 

“Turkey/TSO are in a very active information war,” the official said.

Northeastern Syria, which had  maintained a fragile peace under the leadership of the SDF and its  political arm, the Syrian Democratic Council, has fallen into chaos  since Trump appeared to give Turkey the green light to move in on Oct.  6. Five days into the incursion, more than 800 suspected Islamic State  detainees [escaped](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/14/isis-prisoners-are-escaping-from-camps-in-syria-amid-turkish-offensive.html)  the Ain Issa camp in northern Syria, which holds Islamic State  prisoners, internally displaced persons, and families of Islamic State  fighters.

There are at least 10,000 detained  Islamic State fighters in several prisons across northeastern Syria,  including roughly 2,000 foreign fighters. In addition, there are more  than 100,000 Islamic State family members and other displaced persons in  camps in the region, including 70,000 in al-Hol refugee camp.

U.S. military officials have been  warning for months that camps such as al-Hol are hotbeds for extremist  ideology. The camps include tens of thousands of [female Islamic State fighters and their children](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/07/29/in-overflowing-syrian-refugee-camps-extremism-takes-root-syria-bashar-assad-islamic-state-isis/), Maj. Gen. Alex Grynkewich, the deputy commander of the U.S.-led military coalition to defeat the Islamic State, told *Foreign Policy* recently.

“The real danger to me is it’s the  next generation of ISIS that’s being programmed right there in those  camps,” Grynkewich said, using an acronym for the Islamic State. “I see  this as the greatest long-term strategic risk to the overall global  campaign against ISIS.”",Canada,/r/europe/comments/dhv4ls/turkishbacked_forces_are_freeing_islamic_state/f3qqyxy/,jondevries,1571079342

Have they put something forward? Do they want a different form of government? Do they want independence? Do they want to have the right to not having to extradite criminals?

I mean, the extradition thing is specifically dubious, the whole protest started because Bejing wanted to have a murderer/rapist extradited, and Joshua Wang, the poster boy of these protests, lobbied in Washington for a law that would Hong Kong prohibit to give asylum to American whistleblowers, e.g. someone like Chelsea Manning would be delivered to the US to be tortured.

How would getting sick of coalitions make people vote for AKP exactly?  And their neoliberal policies were held by ANAP aswell

It might not be AKP fixed the 2001 crisis but it is the narrative that they made the economy grow, which was mostly thanks to the pre-AKP reforms under the DSP-MHP-ANAP government, the economic boom Turkey experienced would have happened largely under the DSP-ANAP-MHP governemnt if the election had taken palce in 2004.

I'm not confusing it with rebellion, the difference is very clear between both crimes. I'm only commenting on sedition, since rebellion has been discarded (it shouldn't have been even considered to begin with).

I've read Supreme Court's reasoning and that's why Spanish legal experts who have read it too are already criticizing it, like this former [Spanish Constitutional Court attorney](https://twitter.com/jpurias/status/1183698715942510593). How on Earth can we accept that someone like Carme Forcadell, president of the Catalan Parliament at that time, has been convicted of sedition? It's the only crime she has been convicted of. When did she carry a ""public tumultuous uprising""? It's obvious that she has not committed this crime. It is impossible that she committed it.

The real problem is no other than the clash between spanish nationalism and catalan nationalism, being the rise of catalan nationalism a consequence of the suffocating spanish nationalism and its attitude towards Catalonia.

A few years ago, the catalan government was promised and assured a new Statute which was supposed to grant Catalonia a decent level of autonomy within Spain, but it was the spanish government and its judges who shredded that to pieces, this is what triggered what is now known as the ""proces"".

Spanish nationalism only seeks to homogenize all territories into one state, one which is monolingual, monocultural and mononational.

Spanish nationalists often criticize catalans for wanting to build borders and separate territories and people, but this is not true, there are no borders in EU and Catalonia has no intention of starting one, what spanish nationalists can't accept is people with a different language or a different culture, this is an imaginary border they;re terrified to cross.

The majority of catalans were only seeking for more autonomy, for a more federal or semi-federal status, for a Spain that accepts itself as a multinational and multicultural State, for a territory where different nations can live in peace, but the truth is that after 40 years under a criminal fascist dicatorship, Spain is still drenched of bigoted ultranationalism.",,/r/europe/comments/dhnbug/catalan_separatist_leaders_given_lengthy_prison/f3ptz4m/,suirea,1571064982

The gist of it are same rules governing everybody.

2143,"&gt;You said the constitution was voted without overturning the fascist government.

That's how it was. Franco died of illness, not before reinstating the King. ETA killed his 2nd in command a while before.

There was no revolution at all, nor trials. Nobody ever got sentenced for what happened during 40 years of dictatorship.

&gt;I understand that to mean that you think the people who wrote the constitution were (at least in part) fascists.

Some were. Fraga was a minister under Franco, and was one of the ['fathers of the constitution'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fathers_of_the_Constitution).

&gt;But if so, how did people vote for it to avoid further fascism? 

What I'm saying is that they voted it because they were tired, not because it was as good as it could have been.

&gt;Wouldn't a fascist constitution lead to more fascism?

It has. Spain has had two different severe conflicts with two territories. One of them violent, with 50 years of ETA in the Basque Country; another of them non-violent, with 10 years now of non-violent independentism in Catalonia.

&gt;And how is a constitution that tries to give people from all over the country the same rights a jail for many? 

Because if you're an ethnic minority, you're subject to what the ethnic majority will decide for you.

What started this conflict was the Constitutional Court overturning the critical parts of a Catalan Estatute that was voted by 90% of the seats in the Catalan Parliament. Catalans voted it in referendum too, with 80%. But then Spaniards say: ""Nope"".

There's a part of Spain that acknowledges it's variety, and one that won't. This is a historical concept known as [the two Spains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_two_Spains).",Catalan Republic,/r/europe/comments/dhnbug/catalan_separatist_leaders_given_lengthy_prison/f3p4ng8/,Erratic85,1571043333

Try to talk with someone who has to work on sundays. No one likes it. That is about 30% of workers. The main argument against it was that it would stifle growth but so far there hasn't been any change in growth and companies earnings show no change.

Judicary change is easy. Judicary in poland was never liked. They were seen as bastion of corruption and ineptitude for a longest time. Anyone who ever had to deal with judicary in poland can attest to that. Simple cases can take literally years of just pencil pushing.

&gt;What does this mean? Isn't healthcare already free in Poland?

It is not ""free"", you have to have a job or be on retirement to have health security. PIS already made changes so that basic healtcare checks etc require none of that and want in their next therm to cover all healtcare all people regardless of their job status.

Hospitals are required to treat you even if you don't have insurance but they will bill you after it.

The point here is that in socialized healthcare it makes no sense to keep part of population from medicine. Those people sooner or later will work and not treating them when they get their condition is more costly than just giving them healthcare.

Well, EU gave 14+ billions of free euros to Southern European neighbors on this matter since 2004. Amazing progress, very cool.

&gt;One of three areas that stand out for urgent attention:    
A return to talks on a mobility partnership, where the key quid pro quo will as ever involve the EU facilitating legal migration for business people, students and young workers and the like in return for Morocco further intensifying cooperation on control of illegals, including on return and readmission.

Hol up. Why is the author mentioning cooperation on control of illegals, including on return and readmission as urgent, after he wrote:
&gt;Morocco is for the EU a rare example of political stability in its turbulent southern neighbourhood and has proved to be a reliable and effective partner in control of terrorism and migration.

Main misconception is that the attack is on all the Kurds, which is not true at all. The targeted organizations are YPG / PKK, two organizations that are a threat to national security. I don't know if you guys see the news here in Turkey but just recently some Kurdish families started to address HDP (basically Kurdish Party and some alleged ties to the PKK) that their children got kidnapped and forced to serve the terrorist organization. Again, these people are Kurds.

Plus, do people really believe that US cares so much about Kurds? The only reason that US wants the Kurdish opposition alive is because YPG and PKK fight the Syrian regime, connected to the Russians. This is sort of a proxy war all over again, they don't care about the Kurds' living conditions. They just want to keep their allies that are opposing Syrian regime. 

If it was the US that dealt with a terrorist organization and the Turks supported it, because US was one of the big boys of NATO, they'd flip us off and would tell us to mind our own business, and Turks would be labeled as ""big bad Turk"" because we interfere with our allies' internal affairs. That's just an easy escape.

You seem to just have a vendetta against Spain, which is why you bring that up, which btw is changing the topic. As for the conquest of South America/Andes, you do realize that the Inca conquered/did the same thing only a little less than a century beforehand? As in, the Inca were just a small area but suddenly conquered most of the Andes by force/violence and threats of violence, only to have exactly the same happen to them by Spain a few decades after taking over the Andes? Also the Inca had no problem slaughtering entire villages/clans who refused yo capitulate, whereas Spain simple conquered, not going around massacring tribes/civilians just because they didn't surrender. Keep in mind the only reason a small number of Spaniards managed to topple the Incan empire was because most natives actually saw them as liberators at the time, helping them throw off the Incan rule over them.

No its not because whataboutism is not an argument to dismiss what someone said its to show that their act of moral superiority is bullshit.

&gt;that people of your ilk utilise to distract and muddy the waters about the crimes in which you support.

The fact that you see it as ""distraction"" shows your true colors lol.

&gt;It's also highly presumptuous to think that people support selling arms to Saudi Arabia.

Tell that to your politicians. If when your governments do nothing when we had news after news of suadi arabia's crimes in Yemen but quickly opt to punish Turkey the day the operation starts then we have every right to question your bullshit morality.

&gt;Most people don't, and because we are human and can chew gum and walk at the same time, support for selling arms to Turkey is also becoming less popular. 

The original post clearly was referring to countries governments not to people but if you are someone blinded by nationalism you might have taken that a bit personally.

&gt;You may be blinded by nationalism and defend everything your country does on the world stage, but fortunately it is possible to remain objective on this

The whole point of doing whataboutism is objectivity genius its to question if everybody in the debate is objective with their opinions. Clearly French,German governments are not objective with their stance.

&gt;provided you haven't grown up with the usual embarrassing Turkish fetishising of nationalist symbols such as the flag, Ataturk, Turkish exceptionalism, which all result in Turks having a very warped perception of their country.

Its better than growing up fearing people who carries your nation's flag. I can like my nation's history and symbols while also being critical of it.

2649,"Israel's shift to the right came with the rise of Menachem Begin, a Revisionist Zionist leader and insurgent during the British years. He courted the demographic of both Middle Eastern Jews (who now make up the majority of Israel) and religious Ashkenazi Jews, both of whom had been heavily marginalized and discriminated against by the Mapai government. The Mapai government and kibbutzim were composed of secular Ashkenazim who had a great-degree of internalized antisemitism. 

For a while, it was a part of Zionist doctrine to shift some degree of blame for the Holocaust and other Jewish persecutions on Diaspora Jews for not ""fighting back"". When Middle Eastern Jews arrived in Israel en masse due to expulsions from Arab countries, the Mapai government put them in tents, sprayed them with DDT, and occasionally separated children from their families. Their were reports of them cutting off the ritual sidelocks of children so that they appeared more ""civilized"". Begin genuinely respected Middle Eastern Jews for what they went through and their piety in a way that Mapai didn't. His actions against the British also made him popular.

&amp;#x200B;

To this day, the voting demographics in Israel consistently show Middle Eastern Jews voting to the right, and European Jews voting to the left. The majority of Israel's population are wary due to both their experiences with Arabs and their experiences with the Israeli left, not that that justifies Israeli humans rights abuses.

Japan also isn't in any union and their twilight was when China was still rice picker nation and they had barely anybody around them.

So the idea that EU is everything there is bollocks. Would it impact negatively Poland for a while yes. But the idea that Poland couldn't go its own way or even achieve success is idiotic. The main benefit of EU when Poland joined was EU laws toward economy where state companies couldn't be rescued. This is why it started to develop fast not direct money transfer.

2700,"I would say getting closer but not ""really similar"" as of now. For one thing, Hungary seems to have a much bigger base of far-right voters. Jobbik was, before the leadership sold out its own voters, a very substantial far-right party. Before that happened, Jobbik+Fidesz were at like 65%-70%. Those voters haven't gone anywhere. By contrast, PiS' extra boost this year happened largely because of very good economic times. Their core support is closer to 30-35%. Add Konfederacja and you get to 35-40%, which is significant but still not close to 65% or so. 

Furthermore, PiS didn't make any electoral pitches on immigration this year, probably partly because they have had an extremely loose policy for work migrants, and increasingly for non-European ones too. Orban, by contrast, made immigration his central plank in his re-election effort.

I wouldn't say the two countries are very similar unless Konfederacja gets to 15% or above. A lot of PiS' conservatism is just typical boomerism. But they are becoming closer.

You're right that the state can indeed subsidise, create and protect industries and even in northern european countries they do.

You should not require any kind of government permission to start a bakery, hairdresser, book store, toy store or for basically 90%+ of stores in a typical city. A smoothly functioning legal system is also a good idea. Not having to bribe anyone is also good.

&gt;**Syria: 785 ISIS escaped - Is Europe Ready?**  
&gt;  
&gt;The ISIS nightmare, which Donald Trump claims to have won in full, is rekindled over Europe as the Turkish ""source of peace"" in Syria is in full swing for a fifth consecutive day.  
&gt;  
&gt;The ISIS nightmare, which Donald Trump claims to have won in full, is rekindled over Europe as the Turkish ""source of peace"" in Syria is in full swing for a fifth consecutive day.  
&gt;  
&gt;Hundreds of ISIS jihadists - 785 in number - fled a camp where they were held in northern Syria after a Turkish bombing, according to a Reuters report citing the Kurdish administration.  At the same time, in another camp guarded by Syrian-led Kurdish Democratic Forces fighters in northern Syria, they managed to escape around 100 ""ISIS brides"" and their children.  In the images circulating online, prominent journalists argue that jihadists are portrayed as they flee.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Is Europe ready?**  
&gt;  
&gt;The question, however, is how jihadists in Europe will behave. This is an issue that terrifies the old continent.  Many of them are from European countries and may be trying to return to them. Near the area where the attacks are taking place there are three camps where jihadists are held.  The largest of these is al-Hool, outside the military operations zone, but one cannot be sure that it will be hit by a fire. The Kurds may also decide to withdraw part of the guards, which would make their escape easier.  As Claudia Duncek, head of counter-radicalization consultancy, points out: “There are many women in the Islamic State Prison in the Islamic State, and these women want to revive this entity. They will seize the opportunity and pop it and take action again. Prison riots, sabotage, whatever.   
&gt;  
&gt;**""""The issue is of no concern to Turkish media""**  
&gt;  
&gt;On whether Turkey is well-prepared to deal with such a situation, the German expert doubts: ""For Turkey at this time other issues are important. They are security concerns because it accuses the Kurdish organization YPG of being the Syrian offshoot of the PKK. And most of all there are Syrian refugees who want to move to this area. The issue of the Islamic State and their families does not concern Turkish media at all. ""  In addition to the camps held by ISIS members and their families there are also regular prisons and they are in the business zone.  They hold men, among them very senior executives, and no one wants to know what will happen if they are released.",Greece,/r/europe/comments/dhdkhr/syria_785_isis_jihadists_broke_free_is_europe/f3nnkrb/,noimira57,1571000062

The very aggressive social 500+ program that increased the job inactivity to 48% (48% of able 16+ polish citizens are not studying nor working and are not searching for work - they are not in the unemployment category). Moreover, the Health care system is the last on the EU ranking, we don’t have any R&amp;D and our military is based around a couple of F16 and 40 years old T-72 tanks. There’s no fleet, the military academies underwent a purge of generals (they were sacked) Polish PIS politicians are also hiding and not prosecuting pedophiles in the Catholic Church.

The biggest pis scandals are (part 1)

1. [KNF scandal](https://www.ft.com/content/949bf91e-e6a0-11e8-8a85-04b8afea6ea3) - Leszek Czarnecki, owner of Getin Noble Bank, has claimed(you can find tapes) that Marek Chrzanowski, chairman of Poland’s Financial Supervision Authority (KNF), used a private meeting to suggest the bank hire a specific lawyer and pay him a fee worth the equivalent of 1 per cent of the bank’s market capitalisation in exchange for “support . . . and protection” from the regulator, in an official deposition made by Mr Czarnecki to Polish prosecutors and seen by the Financial Times. There are tapes and you clearly hear the chairman
1.  [SKOK scandal](https://www.reuters.com/article/skokwolomin-bankruptcy/polish-regulator-seeks-bankruptcy-for-credit-union-skok-wolomin-idUSL6N0TW1G720141212) - Cooperative savings banks and credit unions were not included in the banks, so that only after the introduction of the law in 2012, the checks initiated by the Polish Financial Supervisory Authority of credit unions began. After audits, it was found that 44 out of 55 existing savings banks do not meet the requirements. This situation directly threatened the finances of people who had taken out loans or loans from credit unions or entrusted their money. After 2014 controls, 13 credit unions collapsed and around 250,000 people died as a result of their bankruptcy. According to the Business Insider, the bank guarantee fund has so far paid them nearly PLN 4 billion 335 million.
1. [SREBNA-KACZYNSKI scandal](https://www.dw.com/en/kaczynski-tapes-reveal-murky-business-dealings-of-polands-powerful-pis-leader/a-47316459). The company in question, Srebrna, was founded in the mid-1990s by the conservative Porozumienie Centrum (PC) party, a forerunner to the PiS. The company is majority-owned by the Lech Kaczynski Institute, which was founded to commemorate the eponymous Polish president who died in a 2010 plane crash. Lech Kaczynski's twin brother Jaroslaw is on the institute's supervisory board. When Srebrna decided to erect two skyscrapers in central Warsaw, Jaroslaw Kaczynski signed off on the project. The Lech Kaczynski Institute was to move its headquarters to one of the towers and the remaining space was to be rented out. One-third of the annual revenue generated by the buildings would then go to the Lech Kaczynski Institute. A relative of Kaczynski's cousin, Austrian businessman Gerd Birgfellner, was tasked with bringing the €400 million ($460 million) project to fruition. To this end, Poland's state-run PKO Bank Polski apparently granted Birgfellner a €15.5 million loan. Without a permit, he then invested €1.5 million into the project, assuming Kaczynski would greenlight it as planned. But when Birgfellner asked to be reimbursed, Srebrna declined to foot the bill, as Jaroslaw Kaczynski had decided to stop the project.
1. [Morawiecki scandal](https://www.intellinews.com/index.php/poland-s-leading-newspaper-accuses-pm-morawiecki-of-shady-real-estate-deal-161583/). Poland’s Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki used his personal ties with a key figure of the country’s Catholic Church and town hall officials in Wroclaw for a huge business gain that he kept away from the public’s eye, the leading Polish newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza reported on May 20. The newspaper quotes documents to prove Morawiecki paid just PLN700,000 (€172,800 in 2002 prices) for 15 hectares of land, which the Wroclaw diocese had received from the Polish state in 1999. The land’s market price was assessed at PLN4mn at the time. After the PM bought the land, it was zoned to enable construction of an important throughway as well as commercial real estate such as offices. Morawiecki signed over the ownership of the land to his wife in 2013, the newspaper also claimed. The PM never mentioned the transaction or the ownership of the land in mandatory declarations of financial interests that public officials are obliged to submit and make public. The entire land the Morawieckis own is currently worth around PLN70mn, Gazeta Wyborcza claims on the basis of a survey of local land prices.
1. [PFN scandal](https://www.politico.eu/article/polska-fundacja-narodowa-polish-public-promotion-scheme-backfires/)  A lavishly funded Polish organization dedicated to improving the country's international image is trying to rescue its own reputation. The Polish National Foundation, founded in 2016 and financed to the tune of 400 million złoty (€93 million) from the country's leading state-run corporations, was supposed to combat the deluge of bad press about the country's ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party. The foundation hasn't been willing to say much about its finances in Poland, but the online news portal Onet dug through financial statements made in Washington by a U.S. lobbying firm hired by the Polish organization. Onet reported that the White House Writers Group, a Washington PR firm, has been paid $5.5 million since 2017 to raise Poland's profile in the U.S. — a sum similar to the annual budget of the Polish Embassy in Washington. A YouTube site set up for the foundation had 13 subscribers as of Tuesday, with mostly fewer than 10 views per video. An Instagram account with stock images of Poland had 51 observers. And even some of those images were wrong. A picture of a sunset over the Polish capital turned out to be of Prague. A photo of ski jumping champion Kamil Stoch was of an acrobatic ski jumper — a completely different sport.
1. [Sex hotel Banaś (Chief of Supreme Audit Office) scandal](https://emerging-europe.com/news/polish-ruling-party-politician-linked-with-criminal-underworld/) Marian Banaś , a Law and Justice (PiS) politician and recently appointed chief of Poland’s Supreme Audit Office has been heavily embroiled in a corruption scandal, another to hit the ruling party just weeks before the country votes in a parliamentary election. Mr Banaś served as finance minister from June to August this year, and is a key figure in the party. Mr Banaś concealed his possession of a tenement house in Krakow from his financial disclosures. This property was then revealed to have deep running connections with a local, criminally-run escort agency. He claimed that the house was given to him by an old friend whom he met in the Home Army, which he then renovated. In his disclosures he claimed he would sell the house, which never happened. Banaś claims that this was due to the buyer’s inability to get a loan. Investigations have further revealed that Mr Banaś agreed to rent the property for 5000 zloty a month, 10,000 zloty lower than its estimated market value, according to Gazeta Wyborcza. Just as the scandal could not apparently get any worse for Mr Banaś, further investigation by journalist Bertold Kittel revealed criminal links. When Mr Kittel entered the property he found at the reception an infamous Krakow criminal known as one of the brothers K – Wiesław or Janusz, who control escort agencies in the region. While still under investigation, there have been suggestions of contact between the two.

According to the Onet report, Piebiak operated and financed an online campaign by a woman called Emilia who allegedly sent over 2,000 letters and emails about Markiewicz to other judges as well as to pro-government right-wing media. The messages contained fabricated, semi-confirmed and gossipy details of the judge’s personal life. According to Onet, Emilia obtained Markiewicz’s personal address from Piebiak so she could send him one of the letters.",,/r/europe/comments/dheun6/polish_elections_exit_poll/f3mz2md/,Logiman43,1570993482

ELI5: PIS is taking its power from six very controversial arguments they are using on every occasion:

* Fight against communism. They are accusing the opposition (the previous ruling party PO) to consist mostly of ex-communists or communistic party members or collaborators. The issue is that most members of PO fought against the communism and spent months/years in prison in the ’80 (it is true, some had communistic backgrounds). On the other hand, the PIS party members scarcely fought for polish liberty and some of its party members are former communistic party members or communistic prosecutors [Piotrowicz](http://inside-poland.com/t/communist-era-prosecutor-to-keep-job-with-polands-governing-party/)! [Ie Polish CT judge]( http://inside-poland.com/t/back-to-the-prl-polands-new-government-appoints-former-communist-party-member-as-constitutional-court-judge/).

So, PIS is fighting against itself.

* PIS is pro family. The party is giving away 500zl per month for the second and following kids in Poland. It is a very good idea however it “bought” the elections. The polish economy is unable to sustain such an endeavour [roots of populism]( https://www.cidob.org/en/articulos/cidob_report/n1_1/the_roots_of_populism_in_poland_unsustainable_growth_and_cultural_backlash). My [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6om5ex/dear_europe_please_help_us_defend_freedom_in/dkihv9f/)

* PIS is pro catholic religion. Even by funding catholic foundations from [public money]( http://natemat.pl/172191,ojciec-rydzyk-otrzyma-dofinansowanie-sad-przyznal-jego-fundacji-26-mln-zl-odszkodowania). Ie £4.7 million to Lux Veritatis, a foundation behind ultra-conservative Catholic radio (Radio Maryja) and TV (Telewizja Trwam) stations 

* [Fear against refugees](http://www.politico.eu/article/politics-nationalism-and-religion-explain-why-poland-doesnt-want-refugees) and calls for [xenophobia](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/25/poland-right-law-justice-party-europe)

* The fight against nepotism. It is true that the previous government used its power to fill the various ranks with colleagues and family. However the said persons were qualified to serve these functions. When PIS came to power they fired everyone and filled the ranks with their family, mostly unqualified. The most famous was “24yo Misiewicz, a former pharmacy assistant without a university degree, also has been given lucrative jobs in the defense industry under Macierewicz. The apparent favouritism has raised ethics concerns in a party that won office promising to fight corruption.” [source](https://apnews.com/91620f6ad9124b4b9b6c72ff75273158/conflict-erupts-top-ranks-polands-ruling-party) There is even a webpage listing more than 1000 cases of nepotism under PIS [Misiewicze]( http://misiewicze.pl/lista-misiewiczow). 

* the so-called [assassination](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/636whw/polish_prosecutors_say_russians_deliberately) of Kaczynski's twin president brother in Smolensk. They created a ""cult"" around his death.

[""Alleged"" Paedophila and Sex trafficking scandal with Kuchcinski](https://newsbeezer.com/polandeng/sex-scandal-with-pis-politician-the-cba-agent-requests-the-disclosure-of-this-evidence/)  Wirtualna Polska learned the contents of the message of CBA officer Wojciech J. to the prosecutor's office about the failure of the head of the CBA, Ernest Bejda. In the background is a lost record with a recording of one of the leading PiS politicians who should have sex with a minor Ukrainian girl lost. His name falls on the document. In the message, Wojciech J. refers to several reports that he was the head of the office in connection with the ""unauthorized access to his armored cabinet during his absence"" submitted. From this vault, a record should be lost in escort agencies from the Podkarpacie region. One of the leading PiS politicians should have sex with a young Ukrainian in the recording. The statement signed by lawyer Beata Bosak-Kruczek mentions the name of Sejm spokesman Marek Kuchciński.

The Bialowieza Forest is a UNESCO World Heritage site that sprawls across the border between Poland and Belarus, occupying almost 580 square miles of woodland and providing home to rare European wood bison among others. Minister Jan Szyszko and foresters have said that more trees need to be cut down because of an infestation of the European spruce bark beetle. Environmentalists, meanwhile, say that increased logging will cause irreparable damage to the ancient forest, which attracts thousands of tourists each year.
1. [Illegal presidential pardon for CBA chief Kaminski](http://archiwum.thenews.pl/1/9/Artykul/309656) In 2013, Law and Justice (PiS) MP Mariusz Kamiński – who served as head of the anti-corruption agency from 2006 and 2009 – was found guilty of overstepping his powers. He was sentenced to three years in prison and was banned from holding public office for ten years. Polish President Andrzej Duda pardoned Kamiński even though he was still appealing his sentence at the time. The case against Kamiński was then discontinued. A supreme court judge said that the president interfered in the legal process because Kamiński was proven neither innocent nor guilty when he was pardoned, making a future ruling redundant. The judge said that the president can pardon someone after any final appeal has been heard “because then he is not interfering with the judiciary”.

After the election of the new KRS, a publication of the list with the names of judges declaring their support for specific candidates was refused. The Supreme Administrative Court ruled that those names must be disclosed. However, the Chancellery of the Sejm has yet to carry out the NSA’s ruling.

According to TVN, the money went toward the purchase of a “new system to spy on telephones and computers, the most expensive system in the history of Polish secret services.” Reports that the covertly purchased system could be Pegasus — a top-performing spyware that is impossible to track — surfaced last week.

2938,"&gt;And what Catalans ask for is a simple referendum, not a referendum where a huge majority is required for one of the options.

Which means you want to force potentially 49% of people to deal with a massive change they don't want.

&gt;Think of it the other way: would the people supporting union with Spain accept a referendum where the requirement is 2/3 majority for the remaining option? It seems neither fair nor objective.

To me it is pretty logical that a change would require more people in support compared to keeping things the same.

&gt; managing to convince the majority of Catalans with higher levels of education. While unionists concentrate the elderly and uneducated population

This is very dangerous level of thinking, since you are now basically saying the higher educated are in the right while the elderly and uneducated are easily convinced by - according to you - bad information. While those uneducated might be the most impacted by the economic downturn after such a massive change. They have less options to move or adapt.

&gt;so Catalonia would become a member state in that case.

Unless you can get everyone to agree on that and sign off on it beforehand, such an assumption is very dangerous to make considering the massive impact it would have if it doesn't come true.

I don't have all the answers also, but it seems to me that to make such massive changes, you also need a massive majority to support it or you will have decades of more trouble.",,/r/europe/comments/dgyb6z/catalan_separatist_leaders_to_get_up_to_15_years/f3mcg1y/,cissoniuss,1570986263

2941,"I know from your local perspective it may not make sense (really there’s a lot about economic that seems silly at first glance), but there are very real, huge differences in costs and complexity. And moreover the difference can be indeed counted and quantified. A proper study of it requires looking at way more than new business starts, but I would be shocked if the actual rate in Spain is anywhere near the top of the EU per capita. 

So people who want to start an industry... they do the math. They compare the court system speed, regulation costs, costs of hiring the right workers (often imported specialists) and they go to where it’s the easiest and cheapest. That’s the point of this analysis, they do the same analysis the people who start, run, and expand industries do and try to give a (partial... shit is never simple of course) reason to explain it. Hence why it gets simplified in headlines as ‘competitiveness’- can’t really say a quantitative analysis of judicial systems, regulations, state industry ownership, immigration laws, and a million other things.

Instead of only the very best worthy succeeding to the goal (being rich) by the very design of said goal, everyone can reach the ""European dream"" (or at least, that's the objective/goal) with a much calmer path to that dream.

3044,"Instead of the separatists, we should ask ourselves what all the Catalans want because it's a referendum that affects all Catalans. And what Catalans ask for is a simple referendum, not a referendum where a huge majority is required for one of the options. Think of it the other way: would the people supporting union with Spain accept a referendum where the requirement is 2/3 majority for the remaining option? It seems neither fair nor objective. And I'm sure that the separatists wouldn't accept it either, although it obviously benefits them. A standard referendum, like the Scottish one or the 2018 New Caledonian independence referendum (from France) is the preferred option for citizens.

It's indeed very important to get all the information before making such a decision. And I think the separatists have done a much better job than the unionist side in this regard, managing to convince the majority of Catalans with higher levels of education. While unionists concentrate the elderly and uneducated population, much like the Brexit voter ([source](https://i.imgur.com/gyoH6wf.png)).

As for the European Union, it's clear that Spain would veto Catalonia's membership in case of unilateral independence. At least for the first years, as Spain does with Kosovo.

3079,"A good place to start is understanding the definition of a concept before using it. 

The way you're using the word ""propaganda"" as an umbrella term is incorrect, but understandable given that dictionary definitions are extremely vague. The same can be said about the word ""terrorism,"" whose actual definition involves criteria not covered by the dictionary definition.

Propaganda does not include all persuasive messages targeted at a large audience, even when such messages promote a specific agenda. A persuasive message based on factual statements and logic is not, in fact, propaganda. Propaganda substitutes logic with faulty reasoning and/or emotional appeals which are not grounded in fact, regardless of whether the message attempts to help or harm. There is always a measure of deceit, direct or indirect.

Whether I personally agree or disagree with a message has no bearing on whether it is propaganda or not. This kind of judgment is not based on opinion, but on objective fact. 

So, in order to determine whether the OP's message is propaganda or not, you have to go through each statement and establish its veracity. Is it a fact that nothing is happening at our borders? (and especially at the borders he/she names). I would say yes. Is it a fact that our water is clean? I'd say that's mostly true, but debatable, since there are probably places where there might be contamination (this has to be fact-checked). And so on. Lastly, is it a fact that ""boring is good""? That's also debatable, since it can be argued that while the lack of negative events is good, the absence of crisis can also lead to stagnation and complacency (but this is subjective). 

This message attempts to be factual and succeeds to an extent, but also has some gray areas. So that's why I said that it's benign propaganda at worst, as it's not 100% unambiguously factual, but it also doesn't attempt to deceive on purpose.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/dh8xr1/as_an_advertising_student_i_made_a_small/f3lstar/,Hangry_Squirrel,1570979219

Pride is about ""gay liberation"", it first happened on the first anniversary of the Stonewall riot as a way to commemorate the event. Stonewall was a gay inn/bar in New York that got raided by the police in 69, it escalated into a full-blown riot as the LGBT folks there resisted. So gay pride was a way to keep the memory alive and show other people that they existed, weren't going anywhere, and that they would always fight for their rights. Over the years it spread across the world with always the same message. 

So in some countries pride is still in great parts about resistance, in other it is mostly about remembrance, in a nutshell gay pride is the LGBT equivalent of celebrating one's Independence day. ""Shoving their sexuality in your face"" is the point. Thinking it only from a PR perspective would be self-defeating and those that dislike gay people because of it and thinking this is ammunition to use against them? They are the exact reason LGBT people do it and the audience they do it for. Taking from one of their chants: ""We're here, we're queer, get used to it"". The idea is that you don't get to like gay people only when you can pretend they don't exist because you don't see them. The guys that dislike pride? They're the same guys that end up hating LGBT people appearing in media or kissing and holding hands in public because then it is ""shoved in their throat"".",The 5th bee in the oven,/r/europe/comments/dgt88b/president_zelenskyy_ukraine_responds_to/f3jque6/,FloatingOutThere,1570956949

Please let me know if you have suggestions to make this roundup better for /r/europe. I can search for posts based off keywords in the title, URL and flair. And I can also search for comments.

If you would like this roundup sent to your reddit inbox every day send me a message with the subject ['europe'](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=subredditsummarybot&amp;subject=europe&amp;message=x). Or if you only want a weekly roundup, use the subject ['europe weekly'](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=subredditsummarybot&amp;subject=europe%20weekly&amp;message=x)

However, I can do more.. you can have me search  for any keywords you want on any subreddit you want. Send a message with the subject ['set europe'](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=subredditsummarybot&amp;subject=set%20europe&amp;message=200%0A25%2C%20keyword1%2C%20another keyphrase%2C%20last example) and in the message: specify a number of upvotes that must be reached, and then an optional list of keywords you want to search for, separated by commas. You can have as many lines as you'd like, as long as they follow this format:

    200  
    50, keyword1, another keyphrase, last example

  You can also do ['set europe weekly'](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=subredditsummarybot&amp;subject=set%20europe%20weekly&amp;message=200%0A25%2C%20keyword1%2C%20another keyphrase%2C%20last example) And you can replace europe with any subreddit.

3630,"&gt; It was originally Slovakia

Originally (before 12th century) it was Poland and before that it was just a land with Slavic speaking tribes. Not many people lived there and the pre-20th century borders weren't even accurately appointed.

&gt; They stole the land in the beginning of the 20th century.

Stole? It was Czechoslovakia that didn't want a referendum in this region in the early 1920s (Poland was fighting with the Bolsheviks at the time so it agreed to this terms) so only part of the propounded area was given to Poland. Furthermore, the region that eventually became Polish ([Polish Spis](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polski_Spisz)) - the one that is showed in this post was majority Polish and the international Conference of Ambassadors gave it to Poland without any doubts in 1920.

&gt; They were shooting to the Slovak villagers that were resisting them. 

Source? The were some clashes but between armies not villagers and mostly in the area more to the south (not in the Polish Spis where this photo was taken).

&gt; Poles are the same as Russians. Imperialists.

What? This region was always mixed, with no clear national identity. If talking about a stealing in this region I can think of the [Zastaw spiski](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zastaw_spiski) - the region specified in this agreement was Polish from 1412 to 1769 when Austrians took this land just before the first partition of Poland. 

&gt; Check this table of the nationalities living in the stolen villages in 1910. Why isn't this table on the Polish wikipedia?

The population census you linked is biased because there was no Poland to choose (they were counted as Slovaks). And yes, there is a list of nationalities of this region in Polish Wikipedia but in [another article](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spisz), which BTW once again confirms that the northern part, from which that photo comes from, had majority Polish population.

&gt; And before somebody bring in the Hungarians in the southern Slovakia. Yes, I and many Slovaks and Slovak historians agree that a lot of the land that is now part of Slovakia should stay in Hungary. But you will never hear something like that from the Poles, the best Slavs under the Sun.

Yes, of course, you had many discussions with Polish historians and read Polish books :D Most people in Poland aren't even aware of the Spis issue and its history. It's a tiny piece of land (about 195km2) and to be honest it's nothing like a situation in southern Slovakia because the Slovakian minority is from 1% to 3% of inhabitants in just 5 municipalities and the Polish Spis has mostly Polish identity.",Poland,/r/europe/comments/dgyysj/białka_river_poland/f3iipo5/,MajesticTwelve,1570937194

3639,"If the Turks crush Syrian Kurdish forces this weekend, how should we react? You can say that these Kurds are our allies, who risked and gave their lives confronting Islamic State jihadists not so long ago. That decent countries defend their friends, and we should act. Or you might argue that there’s been too much Western “acting” of late, costing billions and achieving nothing. So best leave the Kurds to fight their own battles.

I’m in the former camp. When Sir John Major’s government decided to defend the Iraqi Kurds with a no-fly zone in 1991 – in effect, protecting them from Saddam’s butchery – it led to stability and even prosperity. We ended up with good relations, trade, even Land Rover dealerships in Irbil. And we exchanged people. The page you’re reading was designed by Kuchar Swara, a Kurd who also redesigned The Spectator. Business minister Nadim Zahawi is another Kurdish export. The Kurds have long been Britain’s friends. And America’s, too.

But Donald Trump is redefining alliances now. The Kurds didn’t fight in Normandy, he bizarrely said this week, so why should America shield them from the Turks? Or shield anyone in the region from anyone? “The worst mistake the United States has ever made, in my opinion, is going into the Middle East,” he said. He puts the cost of deployments in Afghanistan, Libya and Iraq at anything from $4 trillion to $8 trillion, depending on his mood and his audience. His upshot: he’s fed up with America being the world’s policeman. He’s walking away from the role, and his allies will have to get used to it.

For allies like Britain, this is all rather serious. “Before, the Americans would at least consult us,” says one minister. “Now, we have no idea what they’ll do. This lowers our credibility with our own allies.” Britain’s great boast has been a “special relationship” that can influence America. But what good is that when even the Pentagon is blindsided by the White House? When Trump said he’d pull troops out of Syria earlier this year, there was panic in London and talk about whether Britain should stay and continue the fight. It was a brief discussion. Without America, no one else had the power to do anything.

This is not just Trumpian madness. Most of the 20-odd Democrats running for the presidential nomination offer their own versions of Trump’s arguments: that too much blood and money has been spent trying (and failing) to solve problems in the wider world. Bernie Sanders and Trump both talk about American interventions over the years as “endless war.” Polls show Americans have come to regard the George W Bush missions as a miserable failure. Given that the Taliban now controls more of Afghanistan than at any point since 2001, no wonder.

You’ll find plenty of politicians in Washington who also describe Nato as a scam that allows freeloading Europeans to enjoy US military protection without paying for it. Or asking why Britain (and many other countries) have not taken care of their homegrown jihadists caught in Syria, especially the 2,000 jailed by the Syrian Kurds. Two British jihadists, members of the so-called Beatles, were spirited away by the Americans yesterday. To Trump, this sums up the tiresome way in which his country always ends up doing the mopping up.

The new Turkish drama at least offers us a glimpse of what the world looks like without America. Vladimir Putin, who is busy putting together an oil network in Syria and the Middle East, can now present himself as the dominant force in the region. Look, he can say to the Saudis, who is a better friend? Trump, who has just abandoned the Kurdish fighters that he armed so recently? Or a Russia that stood by Bashar al-Assad even when he was gassing children in the streets of Damascus?

Without America, the 77-member international coalition against the Islamic State might not have got very far. Of the 22,000 airstrikes carried out, more than 17,500 were from the US Air Force. David Cameron and Nicolas Sarkozy led the charge in Libya, but when it came to discharging the £1 million-a-piece Tomahawk missiles, the US Navy was pretty much on its own. Without Uncle Sam, no end of sharp words would have been fired off from European capitals. But not much more.

Now and again, we hear reports about the readiness of Europe’s various armies. They’re invariably terrifying. The Dutch admitted recently that half of their army vehicles won’t start. Two months ago, all 53 of the Bundeswehr’s attack helicopters were declared unfit to fly. France does a bit better: at the last count 160 of its 460 military helicopters work. Military readiness costs money, and not many European nations pay. If Turkey were to lead a surprise attack against Europe, rather than the Syrian Kurds, it’s by no means clear what opposition it might meet.

A recent study for the RAND Corporation looked at what might happen if Putin invaded Latvia. The Germans, it found, would need a month to mobilise a battalion in response: the Brits, it turns out, could need three months. For bigger missions, the degree of reliance on America is stunning. And it’s looking like a more dangerous bet every year.

Karen Pierce, the UK Ambassador to the United Nations, puts it well: the world we face now involves an aggressive Russia, a more assertive China and an inward-looking America – and it’s the latter point that’s the most worrying. Jeremy Hunt had a point when, in the Tory leadership campaign, he said that a post-Brexit Britain should double defence spending. Not because the world is a more dangerous place, but Britain needs to show it can act independently. If Uncle Sam vanishes from the picture, everything changes – as the Kurds are now finding out.

Trump has asked Recep Erdogan to behave himself in pursuit of his Kurdish enemies, saying he’ll “totally destroy and obliterate” Turkey if anything untoward happens. Given his opinion of foreign entanglements, it’s unlikely. The world is learning to expect plenty of words from Washington, but ever-less action: Trump has become a president who speaks loudly while carrying a small stick. For America’s allies, it’s the worst possible combination.",Denmark,/r/europe/comments/dh5dmu/europe_is_dangerously_unprepared_for_a_world/f3ijmuz/,DaphneDK42,1570937588

3704,"&gt; US most certainly wasn't going to nuke western Europe
yeah. US and UK was going to nuke USSR straight after WW2. And all 80 years after that. did you know that? probably not

Lol. Last I checked, USSR was **eastern** Europe not Western. And Yes of course US, UK (and France, you forgot they had nukes too I see) were ready to nuke the Russians during the cold war, that's why they did all those bomb drills in the 50s and 60s, because USSR had their nukes trained on the west. It was a very real threat to both sides. 

How could you possibly think anyone isn't aware of that ?

&gt; Without knowing any history and politics 

Now how on earth do you jump to that conclusion ?

&gt; you were told that ""dirty commie wanted to nuke US and EU and invide it""

Lol. I don't think Putin and his oligarchs could be labelled ""commies"" under even the loosest definition of the word. Authoritarian Dictatorship pretending to be a democracy, yes. Commie, no.

&lt;snip long list of American misbehaviour&gt; 

No argument, I'm not a particular fan of the Yanks, particularly as the get ever closer to being a fascist state (see comment about them becoming a rogue state in the post you replied to). However your ""whataboutism"" doesn't address the key point which you clearly didn't get: my answer to ""why is it always Russia being the potential trigger"" was ""because cold war"" it lasted long enough to imprint that paradigm as being the key threat to western Europe.

Now, as I said (please refer above) with America seemingly going rogue we west Europeans do need to rethink our threat model. I think a fascist USA (hopefully they'll turn away from that cliffedge) would be a much bigger existential danger to the EU, but then, it still doesn't remove what then becomes a possibly lower but still clear threat from the world's second largest nuclear arsenal.

take what happend in brussels as an example, you want to do the protest in the palace gardens (because you won't bother any working people there), but police arrests those who try to get in there, meanwhile, the protest on the public road blocking common people is allowed.....

so it's fine to block off streets, it's not fine to sit in a yard.

massive protests with hundreds of thousands of people following the law and having legal permission(climate marches) yield no results, now we get people breaking the law to press the issue, still no result.

I think the Sherman doesn't get enough credit for how good it actually was.

The Sherman was very reliable, had adequate armor and a capable gun, was easy to repair and also cheap. Contrary to popular belief, even the short gun was able to handle most German tanks\*. The UK Firefly variant did only have a slightly improved penetration ability, so it was not considered to be worth it. And when talking armor protection, it was not a death trap, casualties in tanks were far lower compared to infantry. The crew was able to easily get out. (Only high explosive shells really kill the crew outright if they penetrate. Most men did survive a hit that went through the armor)

\* Shermans could handle all but Tigers, but Tiger tanks were very rare. Both variants combined, Tiger and King Tiger, only saw less than 2000 build. In a tank battle, the side that engaged first was usually the one to win, as you only engage the opposition if you think you will win.

In order to mae you understand the situation I have to push a lot of effort.
So I will just tell you this until 2015 Erdogan was a puppet of US, then they unplugged him and thats when Turkey got close to Russia.

Before that we were shooting ourselves in the foot and helping US raising jihadists so they can attack Essad regime. The US' primary aim was to destabilise any country that is on Kurdish corridor.

In 2015 it was Turkeys turn to be destabilised so they unplugged Erdogan.
In 2016 the coup attempt wasnt exactly completely theatre, it was Gulenist(a religious cult whose head is a US agent now lives in Pennysilvania,US) but Russia warned Erdogan so they intervened before it was organised enough.

Nowadays Turkey continues to raise Fsa jihadists but now in order to destroy YPG. The Kurdish terrorist organisation that is trying to found its own country(obviously destabilising for Syria right ?)

So Essad is actually happy with what is going on atm.

So Turkey pre 2015 like you said had been destabilising but now stabilising.

all US wants is a puppet Kurdish state in middle east bordered to both eastern mediterranian and also Persian gulf. 

Its just a geopolitical war with Iran and US. If today Iran invade gulf, they can cut off the entire patrol flow.

If a Kurdistan ever gets found on Kurdish corridor US will both be able to take oils through it via eastern mediterranian and also found military bases that put pressure on Iran and even Russia.

Truth is as open as this but you refuse to see it.

This is why once Turks captured afrin US lost interest in Kurds.(now the Kurds being betrayed silliness remember ?) Because afrin was the gateway to E.Mediterranian for Kurdish corridor !!! a Kurdistan without borders to E. Mediterranian is no better than no Kurdistan capishe ?

The only way to stop the, ever increasing, wave of immigrants/refugees is to move them to external camps with plenty of media coverage. They'll soon learn that it is not worth the risk, money, etc... to come illegally in Europe because they'll always end in an external camp.

Note: [Australians are doing just that](https://youtu.be/kNyx1O6panU).

__________________________

External camps should be located in non European countries. There would be economic compensation and humanitarian aid. The cost would be a fracion of what we are spending now. Supporting immigrants/refugees is much cheaper outside Europe. Many lives would be saved as the dangerous crossing to Europe would be stopped.
__________________________

Europe can't solve all the problems of the world.

We should accept only those immigrants/refugees that we can safely integrate in our societies. That means a thorough check of those (limited numbers) we let come in (as Canada, Australia... are doing).

It is an easy choice: We deal rationally with this problem or we commit cultural (economic, social...) suicide.

Movies like ""Blazing Saddles"" will never be made, ever again and that pains me to no end.  and if you haven't watched it fucking watch that movie!! holy shit man, Mel Brooks was singlehandedly bringing enlightenment to the ignorant masses.  

Fuck, at the start of the 90s we were well on the way to moving onto living together with respect to race relations; we had a long way to go (getting the cops under control and war on drugs fucking people up big time by arresting so many of our kids and giving them police records over a fucking dime bag of yayo)  but we were moving in the right direction.  

I joined the Army in 1990; one of the most profound sayings I learned at that time was ""Nobody prays for peace more than the warrior"". 

If I were forced to describe my ideologies, I'd say I'm a centrist, right leaning Republican.  I believe the Bill of Rights doesn't ""grant"" us shit.  It's there to protect our inherent rights AGAINST the tyranny of our government.  ""love my country, fear my government"".  I need to have that tattooed backwards on my forehead so I see it every morning when I look in the mirror. 

I'd just love to have a conversation in the U.S. where we can talk about issues without propaganda added.  I do my best to keep an open mind; I'm lucky enough to have had a GREAT family who loved me FIERCELY.  They taught me other people think other things, and on lots of issues we can both be right and not hate each other.  I'd love to get back to that kind of philosophy.

They're way too careful to be that brazen that far from their influence area. For now they are consolidating their hegemony in the China Sea, and until they haven't done so, they won't go places where they have to challenge big influencers. 

Right now they are going on overdirve trying to develop and grow their military but they are still way behind technologically. Their one advantage is the sheer manpower they have, but otherwise they are really behind in a lot of stuff, eg. submarines. They are a regional power, have always been and them trying to get global is really recent and thus needs a lot of preparation. 

Their lack of hard and soft power is why they've mostly been (aggressively) moving only in their direct neighbourhood or in places that are mostly ignored by Russia/USA (like Africa). I've read someone that put it like that ""most influencial powers shape their foreign policies like they are playing chess, China is playing go"". In other words, China is all about caution and mousy/sneaky behavior, they rather flex their economy rather than their military. And economy only gets you so far.

**TL;DR**: China won't ever move in a way that could be taken as a direct threat/challenge to Russia by moving in once the US is gone. After all China has a Cold War of their [own](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Soviet_border_conflict) with Russia.

4218,"&gt;so i really don't understand what argument you're trying to make here. 

The point is that the ruling said that the declaration of independence is legal, not independence itself, which is what we, and the resolution, discuss.

&gt;No, it states that the ""interim political framework"" should preserve the territorial integrity of the FRY. The resolution is silent about the final status of Kosovo and thus does not constrain or determine its final level of autonomy/independence. This is the legal opinion shared by both the EU and ICJ.

It clearly states that all UN members are committed to respecting FRY's (now Serbia's) sovereignty in regards to Kosovo. Yes, it also opens up a new Kosovo process, a process which is to comply with the rest of the resolution, and to be decided by the UN, not the Kosovo Albanians themselves. Again, it was not the UN which decided that Kosovo should be independent, if it was we'd have little to argue against. Independence was instead decided upon by the Albanians with a UDI, and they didn't the right to decide Kosovo's final fate.",Rep.

I'm not so sure if that's true. Even in countries where gun possession is legal I doubt that mafias use registered weapons. And anyway they use also weapons that everywhere are illegal.

I guess the black market is the main supplier of organized crime, drug dealers, traffickers etc., not legal gun stores.

4370,"&gt; But why are Poles voting for a Government that is attacking the Independence of the Judiciary ?

There are several reasons why someone votes for a specific party and when your choices are limited (for example we only have 5 parties to vote for now), you dont really need many reasons to do so. PiS has strong support for a couple reasons: strong economy, absolute shit opposition, talking about issues that have been previously ignored (that doesnt mean they are tackling the issues correctly, just that they are at least talking about them - judiciary desperately needing reform is a great example of this), etc.

Regarding the judiciary, Poles always have had a bad opinion of our courts (slow, corrupt, etc). Every once in a while, we get ridiculous court decisions that make Poles not care about judges much. The most recent one that comes to mind is a journalist hit an elderly lady with his car, when she was crossing the street on the pedestrian crossing (legally). He didnt have a driver's license (the police took it away several years ago), required documents for the car (insurance, technical check ups, etc). Our ""wonderful"" courts first gave him a ridiculously low fine, he appealed that and another court decided he was innocent... Additionally, judges are considered to be political already (to a certain degree).

&gt;So why are Polish people supporting this nationalism and attacking the EU ?

There is nothing wrong with nationalism (in the core meaning of the word), its a big part of our history. It was basically ignored under the previous government and when PiS picked up the patriotic/nationalism narrative, a lot of people liked that change.

I wouldnt say attacking the EU. PiS doesnt want Poland to leave the EU like many media claim, they dont like the direction its going (United States of Europe) and many of the EU's decisions, I would say Poles dont have a big problem with this, because we also dont want a complete federation and dont agree with many EU decisions (best example: migrant quotas).

**PP:** The big right wing party we were talking about. Very corrupt.

**Ciudadanos:** Initially born as a Spanish nationalistic party in Catalonia, was propped by media and big business a few years ago to replace the PP, as they had a cleaner public profile. The attempt failed and they are declining now, in part due to an image of being very hipocrytical in their discourse/actions. Always vote together with PP in parliament.

**Vox:** Born from the hardcore nostalgic branch of the PP. Extremely nationalistic and traditionalist, their discourse centers around criticism of minorities and movements like immigrants from poor countries, LGTB, regional nationalisms, and feminism. Economically, they support policies that favour big fortunes, similar to the other conservative parties in Spain. More overtly catholic-traditionalist in their discourse, although when it boils down to parliament vote the others are too.

**PSOE:** Ironically, in practice they are not dissimilar from conservative parties. Economically speaking, they usually defend similar measures and favour big fortunes and corporations, but occasionally agreeing with other parties some progressive policies (like a recent increase in minimum wage). Socially speaking, they are somewhat progressive in most aspects in their discourse, but also very comfortable with the status quo (including religion, which at the moment is not really separated from the state). They are a very big party, and one of the oldest in Spain, so it's no surprise that they are the second in corruption after PP.

4447,"This article was published on  22 Feb 2004. It would have been worthwile to include that date in the tittle. Speaking of title, it would have been better not to editorialise it and keep the original :

&gt; Now the Pentagon tells Bush: climate change will destroy us

This article is not quite clear on how the risks are articulated, nor which is the consequence of what.

The risk that climate change could change currents in the Atlantic and therefore lead to a much colder climate in Western Europe is well known, and I'd suppose it was known in 2004. However a 'Siberian' climate in Britain is more evocative of a nuclear winter, and that a nuclear war could come out the geopolitical tensions stemming from climate change was not, still is not, completely out of the equation.


The use of the phrase ""carrying capacity"" is reminiscent of [The Limits to growth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Limits_to_Growth), which was updated in 2002. This report explores various scenarios, some of which do show a global collapse starting around 2020. I would suppose that this *secret Pentagon report*, which is the topic of this article, likewise explores different scenarios, and that the journalist, for some reasons, insisted on the worst one.

As for London being submerged, while it has not happened *yet*, see Doggerland for an illustration of what a few degrees can do.

Finally, 

&gt; Bush administration's close links to high-powered energy and oil companies was vital in understanding why climate change was received sceptically in the Oval Office. 

is quite an understatement, is not limited to Bush, and is not even new : remember when *Rockefeller* was VP ?

A sobbering reminder that 15 years ago, climate change was already in the public domain, and that not much has changed since, only that it is even worse.

It knew their time was up and in April 1993 there had been a referendum, where ~70% of people had said they want new parliamentary elections. 1993 was their last ditch effort to take control and turn back history. They were unsuccessful, there were new parliamentary elections in 1993 and the communist party got ~12% of the vote.

[We Should Thank China for Its Foolish Steel‐​Dumping Agenda ](https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/we-should-thank-china-its-foolish-steel-dumping-agenda)

&gt;What do basic economics tell us about this situation? China is wasting an enormous amount of resources in order to sell steel to other countries for less than it actually is worth. This is foolish. In essence, China is transferring wealth from itself to other countries.
&gt;
&gt;On the other hand, the United States also is acting foolishly by refusing to accept bargain-priced steel. It restricts imports through the use of 200 antidumping and countervailing duty (AD/CVD) measures. This has made the United States a high-priced island in an ocean of low-priced steel. Economists have understood for decades that restricting imports always reduces a country’s overall economic welfare. The U.S. economy undoubtedly is being hurt by its own protectionist steel policies.

-

&gt; The best approach to resolving the steel market’s challenges would be to open the U.S. border to imports while simultaneously offering aid to steel workers.

How can a complex issue spanning decades be so clear-cut for you, and if it is so clear-cut, why does it even still exist?

But then again, even the ""opposition"" shows its true ultra-nationalist nature every time foreign policy is involved, so I guess it is not really surprising.

Just look at the June 2015 elections to see how most Kurds actually feel about Turkey. Mind you, even those elections were rigged - the last couple even more so - millions of Kurds simply could not or did not vote because they know it won't matter anyway. And how right they were. Didn't Turkey just suspend elected Kurdish mayors from the Kurdish provinces of Diyarbakir, Mardin, and Van? Democracy in Turkey is a joke, and your numbers are anything but representative of what Kurds feel. Take this from me, a Kurd, who earlier this year visited North-Kurdistan (South-East Turkey) and had the privilege of talking with many Kurds from Diyarbakir, Mardin, and Urfa. Even in Urfa, the Kurds were more patriotic and anti-Erdogan than I had expected, for from the outside it is portrayed as this ""Kurdish Erdogan base"", but in reality, it's just a city flooded with 500,000 Syrian Sunni Arab Refugees who resent Kurds and love Erdogan.

Of course, conservative idiot Kurds who vote for Erdogan exist, but they are a minority, and their opinion of your warmonger dictator who butchers their ethnic kin is rapidly changing. 

There are over 25 million Kurds in Turkey and they are not free citizens. Kurdish language was criminalized for almost a century, 5000 Kurdish villages were levelled to the ground, thousands of historic sites purposefully destroyed, over 150,000 Kurdish civilians butchered by Turkish armed forces... the list goes on.

5097,"&gt; The heart of Europe is now beating in Athens, where the 15th annual meeting of the “Arraiolos Group,” comprised of heads of state from around the continent, takes place on Friday.
&gt; 
&gt; The topic of the informal summit, which was convened after the recent, pivotal European elections, is “The Fundamental Principle of Solidarity as a Key to EU Deepening.” The talks will focus on the future of Europe itself, as well as the additional steps needed to further promote European unification.
&gt; 
&gt; The meeting is being held in Athens at the initiative of the President of the Hellenic Republic, Prokopios Pavlopoulos, who will host other European presidents, including Germany’s Frank-Walter Steinmeier, Italy’s Sergio Mattarella, Portugal’s Marcelo De Sousa, and Poland’s Andre Dundas.
&gt; 
&gt; Other presidents, including Hungary’s Janos Ader, Malta’s George Vella, Latvia’s Egils Levits, Slovenia’s Borut Pahor, Estonia’s Kersti Kaljulaid, Bulgaria’s Rumen Radev, Croatia’s Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović and Ireland’s Michael Daniel Higgins will also take part in the talks.
&gt; 
&gt; It is reported that the summit will result in the “Declaration of Athens,” which will address the future of the European Union. Emphasis is expected to be placed on the need to take decisive steps, as swiftly as possible, toward European unification, and by extension, European integration.
&gt; 
&gt; The ultimate aim of the discussions will be to establish a type of “federal” European Union on the terms of a representative democracy.
&gt; 
&gt; Special emphasis will also be given to the themes of the two meetings, with the first focusing on “Effectively Tackling the Economic and Refugee Crisis” and the second on “Tackling the Challenges of Security of the European Union and its Member States.”
&gt; 
&gt; The discussions are expected to conclude at approximately 17:00, with the Presidents giving their statements to the press.

5110,"&gt; Dude, your country allied itself with Nazi Germany and invaded and occupied foreign territory during WW2!

That alliance had nothing to do with ideological sympathies and was the product of Bulgarian ambition and some fear from Germany. We saved all our Jews so obviously Bulgaria then didn't really subscribe to Nazi ideology. It invaded and occupied territory sure, but how is that different from every European country at the time?  Hell many of them continue to invade countries to this day. Lands filled with Bulgarians were viewed as occupied by us too.      


&gt;And now you want the (successor) country that you occupied to remove “Bulgarian Fascist Occupator” from all World War II historic landmarks?    

I don't know if that's what our government really wants. This declaration was partially for local consumption and I suspect merely toning down the disproportional focus on that event would be considered sufficient progress by our government.   

As I said in the bottom of my comment I concede that they probably have cause to view as violent occupiers. Not because I trust their version of events but because it's pretty much impossible to take over territory without any violence. I do think their account is exaggerated though.  


&gt;The point is, that piece of land was never yours to begin with. It hadn't been yours for a thousand years since perhaps the Bulgarian kingdom, and that is a whole other can of worms because it goes into the problem of identity of various slavic tribes, our modern understanding of national identity and your shared history in the Ottoman Empire.   

 It was more Bulgaria's than it was someone else's. There was no such thing as a Macedonian identity not unless you want to go back to the Kingdom of Macedon which was Hellenic and a totally  different thing from  present day Macedonia even if they share the name. There are no accounts of historic figures until very recently that identified themselves as Macedonian, no census that spoke of a Macedonian people, nothing. If Macedonian ethnicity existed it failed to be recorded in any history books. All the people from that land instead identified as Bulgarians or Greeks and briefly Serbs.   


&gt;My point is, you can't just march into *a foreign land* and claim that everything is okay since the locals liked you.   

You can't now. And obviously I don't want such a thing to be done. But you could back then and everybody else did so I don't see how Bulgaria's the bad guy for doing what everyone else did where it had a better claim.  Macedonia's own history is the result of Serbia marching in and turning it into what it is. Their actual independence is only from the 90s.


&gt;So what? It was still a crime and a sign of aggression.   

Yes I don't deny that.


&gt;Regarding the soldiers from N. Macedonia serving in the Bulgarian army. You actually need to be very careful with such claims, people were conscripted left and right by whichever army passed by in WW2   

That's why I said Macedonian majority battalions. If they were a majority that they could probably revolt and change sides if that's what they wanted? Do you know that there is no Bulgarian minority in Macedonia? Every country around it has a Bulgarian minority and this region is many times more intertwined with Bulgaria than them so where are all the Bulgarians? They're the Macedonians and there should be nothing surprising if some of them voluntarily joined the Bulgarian army.     

&gt; It is necessary for your diplomats to find ways to move past your differences and find a common language so that as neighbours you can move forward.   

lol that's what they are trying to do. It's not as common now as it was before (and by before I mean 10 years ago) but Macedonia was absolutely full of anti-Bulgarian gestures, hate crimes and what not, defacement of monuments, insults. This was their government policy, the things I linked to you under the Kingdom of Yugoslavia continued until recently  in spirit if much less violent. It was nothing close to normal neighbourly relations and almost all of the animosity was from the Macedonian government. We extended a bunch of gestures to them (like being the first to recognise their independence, supporting them in international organisations, helping with fires)  that went unrecognised and did nothing  to quell their government's  anti-Bulgarian rhetoric.   
 
All of this is not something that we can solve without demanding their government to change its active policies.   Things have gotten a lot better but there are still many problems and no guarantee things won't deteriorate.


&gt;I don't see how that has anything to do with their ascension negotiations.   

Not only are current members allowed to require whatever from any candidates but candidates do actually have to solve disputes with their neighbours and EU members if they want to join. Stealing our history and peddling anti-Bulgarian rhetoric is  not being a  good neighbour.   

I somewhat feel bad for them and wish we could forget about all this nonsense and support them unconditionally. But I also ask myself why should we  swallow our pride and accept insults and history theft when they don't want to do  the basics for a friendly relationship? And all of that is for their benefit, namely EU membership, not our benefit. Sure the basics may be hard for them to do but it's their own fault that they based their identity on history theft and denying Bulgarian heritage (God knows how they manage both).    


Unfortunately things aren't going to get easier for them.  As absurd as it is our stance on Macedonia has little to do with our interests and is mostly dictated by Moscow. In the past the Bulgarian communist party, now socialist, tried very hard to legitimise Macedonia because that's what Russia wanted. Nowadays the socialists are paddling hardcore nationalism against Macedonia because that would keep them out of the EU as Russia wants. This declaration is   partially a result of their efforts even though they are not in power. If one of the many Russophilic parties forms a government they would probably destroy the fragile warming of relations we've had.

5134,"&gt;you say its nonsense. ok, so you would rather live in china, russia, colombia, or sub-saharan africa, etc. than norway, denmark, canada, or switzerland, etc.? If you can answer that question in the affirmative the list is non sense. But you can't honestly answer the question in the affirmative because its NOT a nonsense list. 

This does nothing to support the validity of the list. The idea that it's better to live in a wealthy democracy than in an totalitarian dictatorship, and that it's better to live in a dictatorship than in a completely collapsed state has never been in question at all. The methods being used to differentiate between between states that are at least in the same obvious tier are all based on nothing even remotely substantial. 

&gt;Now if by nonsense you mean that you can't definitely say #5 is better than #7 the author agrees and says so in the end.

He also says that we can be assured that 5 is clearly better than 15, which is false. You can't seriously intend to argue that life in life in America is unambiguously superior to life in South Korea, or that Slovenia is markedly better than Italy. 

&gt;Or if by nonsense you mean its all subjective, the author addresses that too in the 2nd paragraph. There are both objective and subjective components as the author readily admits. 

Except there *aren't* many objective components, and what little there is are weighted less heavily than the ones that are completely subjective. For example, his heavily weighted ""excellent"" and ""very good"" indexes include the ""Corruption Perception Index"", the ""Global Peace Index"", and the ""World Happiness Report"", while things like the ""Human Development Index"" are rated lower. He's actively made a choice to consider nebulous feelings which don't meaningfully translate across cultures to be more important than actual data.

And on that topic, while I could take the time to rip apart the methodology of many of those reports, it's not even really necessary. I mean, I'll do it if you want me to, but even if we take their accuracy completely at face value, they don't really correlate to how good your domestic life is. For example, the Corruption Perception Index doesn't actually measure real corruption, it measures how corrupt people *think* their country is. The Global Peace Index might (allegedly) tell you how good of a state acts on the international stage, but that doesn't really mean anything for the day to day life of it's own citizens. 

&gt;As for the objective components, if you can in your great wisdom come up with something better than an aggregate of all relevant lists each of which has many criteria and we're done by the UN, think tanks, etc, then do so. 

To begin, not being able to come up with a better idea doesn't preclude someone from being able to point out problems with another. But as it so happens, I do have a better idea. If I were the author, I would consider looking at sources which *actually* have merits, rather than just cherrypicking a dozen which support my preconceived conclusions. After reading through much of his other posted work, I seriously question just how seriously he took his ""research"".

5197,"Bulgaria's occupation was welcomed by most of the natives:

&gt;[When the Bulgarian Army entered Vardar Macedonia on 19 April 1941, they were greeted by most of the local population as liberators, as anti-Serbian and pro-Bulgarian feelings among the local population prevailed at that time.[36][37][38][39][40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II_in_Yugoslav_Macedonia)


Note the 5 sources.  Macedonians also formed the majority of some of Bulgaria's battalions though I don't know how representative that was. Funnily enough some of the opposition to Bulgaria was organised by the Bulgarian Communist Party which has always been an arm of the Kremlin and  tried to help Yugoslavia against Bulgaria.    


Yeah ok we were technically fascists. But our occupation killed
  ""önly"" 6.7k  ëthnic Macedonians (and more of   other minorities). Pretty sure that makes us less fascist than what the Yugoslavs did in that territory, when are we going to call them fascist?  

&gt;Following the two Balkan Wars of 1912 and 1913 and the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire, most of its European-held territories were divided between Greece, Bulgaria and Serbia.[81] The territory that was to become North Macedonia was annexed by Serbia and named South Serbia. Following the partition, an anti-Bulgarian campaign was carried out in the areas under Serbian and Greek control.[82] As many as 641 Bulgarian schools and 761 churches were closed by the Serbs, while Exarchist clergy and teachers were expelled.[82] The use of all Macedonian dialects and standard Bulgarian were proscribed.[82] IMRO, together with local Albanians, organised the Ohrid–Debar uprising against the Serbian rule. Within a few days the rebels captured the towns of Gostivar, Struga and Ohrid, expelling the Serbian troops. According to the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace report, a Serbian army of 100,000 regulars suppressed the uprising. Many were killed and tens of thousands refugees fled to Bulgaria and Albania.[83][84]   


&gt;In the fall of 1915, Bulgaria joined the Central Powers in the First World War and occupied the most of today's North Macedonia.[82] After the end of the First World War, the area returned to Serbian control as part of the newly formed Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes[85] and saw a reintroduction of the anti-Bulgarian measures. Bulgarian teachers and clergy were expelled, Bulgarian language signs and books removed, and all Bulgarian organisations dissolved.[82]   

&gt;The Serbian government pursued a policy of forced Serbianisation in the region,[86][87] which included systematic suppression of Bulgarian activists, altering family surnames, internal colonisation, forced labour, and intense propaganda.[88] To aid the implementation of this policy, some 50,000 Serbian army and gendermerie were stationed in North Macedonia.[82] By 1940 about 280 Serbian colonies (comprising 4,200 families) were established as part of the government's internal colonisation program (initial plans envisaged 50,000 families settling in North Macedonia).[82]

Yes, it does, because they did this without bullshit of suicidal mission, 400 rubles, motivational speech, artificial horror and drinking vodka with comrades right in ""dirty suits"". 

With scouting and preparation, in a normal working atmosphere and task got exaggerated by media.

&gt; that was one of the most heroic things on film in the last few years 

And that's the problem, you don't understand the ""if not us - then who?"" mentality. They did this because they were raised to act like this. ""How I'm gonna look in people's eyes, if I don't do my duty?"" 

&gt; make it seem like everyone just knew the risks and what to do

Les Russes ont proposé aux Français de constituer une mission d’enquête sur la réalité de l’attaque chimique à Douma en Syrie. Il avait été convenu d’un nouveau contact entre les ministres de la Défense dans la journée. Ce contact n’a jamais eu lieu. Pourtant, l’Ambassadeur russe soutient que de nombreux rappels ont été faits.*

5566,"BERLIN—Germany’s security agencies are investigating their own ranks for suspected plots to attack immigrants and politicians, as authorities have become increasingly concerned about allegations of extreme-right radicalism among some soldiers and police officers.

The probes examine a range of activities, from racist discussions in online chat forums and illegal weapons possession, to suspected hit lists of left-wing politicians and liberal activists, according to confidential documents and people familiar with the investigations. The inquiries are also examining alleged plots to carry out terrorist attacks.

The investigations come amid broader concerns over far-right extremism in Germany. On Wednesday, a suspected right-wing extremist attacked a synagogue full of worshipers in the eastern town of Halle on Yom Kippur, the holiest Jewish holiday, killing two people.

They constitute a small minority among Germany’s security personnel, but the presence of anti-immigrant sentiment and rogue networks within the security agencies is an acutely sensitive matter because of the country’s Nazi past.

Officials fear that far-right extremism is seeping into the ranks of police and soldiers, as a number of their officers have been indicted or sentenced, and dozens of others are being investigated, for offenses ranging from links to extremist groups to plotting terrorist attacks in the period since the migration crisis of 2015.

Details of the German investigations were cited in a confidential report earlier this month by Europol, the European Union law-enforcement agency, which found that European far-right militants are actively working to recruit soldiers and police officers in order to acquire combat and weapons skills, according to two officials familiar with the document.

Some of the security agencies’ investigations were launched in recent months, others years ago, but they all gained urgency after a recent increase in politically motivated violence by far-right extremists. A suspected neo-Nazi terror cell went on trial for terrorism on Sept. 30 for allegedly planning mass murder in Berlin. A pro-immigration politician was killed in June and an Eritrean immigrant was gunned down on the street by a self-declared xenophobe.

According to Germany’s domestic intelligence agency, far-right extremists have committed 10,105 violent crimes in the past decade, as well as 83 murders since 1990. In comparison, Islamist terrorists killed 17 people in the same period.

The danger of Islamic terror was now matched by the threat of fight-wing extremism, Interior minister Horst Seehofer said.

“The threat from anti-Semitism, right-wing extremism and right-wingterrorism is very high,” Mr. Seehofer said in a press conference on Thursday

In September 2017, police raided the headquarters of an elite unit of Germany’s special forces.

They found that a special-forces sergeant, who is an expert in sabotage, managed multiple chat channels on the encrypted service Telegram with a total of up to 500 participants, including a SWAT police officer, other senior police staff and senior army officials, as well as civilians such as lawyers and doctors.

In one of the chat channels, the special-forces sergeant, who served in Afghanistan, discussed in 2016 possible violent clashes prompted by Muslim immigration, according to investigation files.

“Unless the conflict happens this year or the next, then in ten years’ time we won’t be able to defend ourselves anymore,” he wrote. When interrogated by police about his message, he said that mass migration would make Islam a state religion in European countries.

Some in the group had discussed rounding up political opponents and shooting them at an abandoned quarry, according to investigation documents. It hasn’t yet been determined whether any participants took steps to enact the plan.

One chat-group member celebrated his birthday by organizing a shooting tournament with a trophy bearing the name of a Muslim victim who was murdered by the National Socialist Underground, a neo-Nazi group. He and former officers of the elite police squad, investigators say, kept a list of pro-immigration personalities they said should be shot in a secluded quarry. They are under investigation for terrorism.

The special-forces sergeant, who declined to be named, was convicted in September for illegal weapons possession.

In December, five police officers were arrested in Frankfurt for sending death threats to an immigration lawyer. According to investigators, one of the threats, sent in a fax, read, “Disgusting Turkish pig, you won’t destroy Germany,” and threatened to “butcher” the lawyer’s daughter.

The officers have been suspended for the duration of the investigation, which is ongoing.

Two Bavarian police officers were fired in April for being members of a far-right association known as Reichsbürger, or citizens of the Reich, whose members have a history of violent encounters with police.

In September, a member of the police’s elite SWAT team who specialized as a sniper was charged for illegally owing a machine gun, two pistols and a stash of 30,000 bullets. Associates of the SWAT member also purchased body-bags to be used on what they called “Day X.” Some of the men told investigators that this was code for a breakdown of the constitutional order due to immigration-related riots, according to investigation files.

In a separate probe, a police inspector and a soldier are being investigated for conspiring to commit a terrorist attack.

Authorities’ investigations into their own ranks have uncovered people who also question the legitimacy of the government and profess admiration for the autocratic rule of President Vladimir Putin’s Russia, according to classified documents concerning two larger investigations seen by The Wall Street Journal, as well as interviews with investigators, suspects and their associates.

Indeed, a group of active servicemen met with Russian elite soldiers and operatives of the FSB, Russia’s main intelligence service, in Stuttgart and in Russia, according to one participant, in 2017 and 2018.

5729,"And this is where a second part of the argument takes shape: Unregistered aliens (to use the US term) that work for minimum wage or below are great for an economy.

It means they are not part of the social backup system we have in place. If they are without work, they cannot claim for unemployment benefits or social security money. They cannot use hospitals, because then again they would show up as unknown, requiring a check of identity. They cannot even retire, even if they worked their entire life.

And if they work, they work either in a black market (without paying taxes, but those taxes are nearly entirely for social welfare anyway) or work with a fake or copied tax-id for minimum wage, meaning the worked for benefits go to somebody else or vanish in the void. And they still pay VAT, so it's not like they pay no taxes at all.

Germany doesn't lack jobs for unskilled labor, it lacks unskilled jobs that can reasonably pay enough for living a good life.

Now, do illegal aliens (to use the US term) contribute more in taxes than they take out? They contribute more, even if they work illegally without paying income taxes, which are 34% of the total tax.

Taxes they do pay are VAT (also 34%), Energytax (7.5%), corporate taxes (6.7% and 2.3%, 9% total) and the smaller remaining taxes that depend on consumption or property. Why do i include corportate taxes in the ones they do pay, because the companies they work for make more money they must pay taxes for when they pay less for wages.

So, what benefits do they lose for their reduction of 34% in tax burden? 41% that goes to pensions, unemployment benefits and social security. 4% for health. (you can make a case that 5% that goes to education and sciences are also lost to them)

So at least 45% less benefits for 34% less contribution. Sounds like a profit to me.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/dfyg2v/v4_reject_eus_plan_on_the_redistribution_of/f3ap4oi/,Alcobob,1570784437

5850,"&gt; Cool story, but there is no need to share fun facts from your personal life here since it's not particularly relevant to anything.

It is kind of relevant when you claim I hate foreigners. Maybe you should just retract that claim as you have zero evidence to support it. 

&gt; Either you do something about them so you could finally have your ""Unity with Europeans, not economic migrants from all around the world"" for the first time in the history of Europe, or you don't do anything about them and will have to deal with the terrible truth that you've been in ""Unity with economic migrants from all around the world"" since the day you were born.

You are really a creative thinker. But guess what? I'm a remainer. And when I say Europeans I am not speaking in racial terms. You are the one who seems constrained by a closed-minded prejudice of who I am and what I believe. That is more than slightly ironic given your holier-than-thou attitude. The political project that is the EU does not have any duty to accept mass immigration from around the world. In fact, for the sake of our precious unity, as Europeans of all backgrounds, we should tighten our borders.

5920,"&gt; hy is it inherently a problem that there are more multinational companies in Ireland?

It isn't. Not inherently. Problem is, Ireland attracts more than it's share of companies, which means skiming the cream. And those companies only pay taxes in Ireland, while doing actual work in other countries. Using infrastructure of those countries. The one they don't pay anything for.

&gt; Do they need to be divvied out equally from on high?

No. It's just that tax havens should be abolished. Either by those tax havens changing their ways, or (painful way) by abolishing double taxiation relief treaties (which, thanks to tax havens, became de facto no taxation treaties).",PL /Lublin voivodship/ (please invest),/r/europe/comments/dfwhnh/ireland_could_lose_1bn_in_corporate_tax_under/f3afh42/,EastPoleVault,1570771138

&gt;Honestly, the lies were weapon grade.

That's a cop-out. People use the same justifications for Trump getting elected.

So what? Governments only exist to lie to you, but it's still not very hard to figure out a lot of stuff with only a very modest amount of information-seeking on the Internet, which even most old people are quite adept at using in the West -- at least insofar as Googling stuff.

I find that most people want to be lied to. They went along with Brexit because it appealed to their prejudices. They went along with Trump because it appealed to their prejudices. Yes, Russia helped both of those. Yes, a lot of billionaires helped both of those votes as well. But in the end it was the prejudice and bigotry of a large segment of US and UK population that got both Brexit and Trump to become the reality.

The source of your confusion is that you believe in a strawman single-issue Brexit argument that is all about immigration or nationalism.

I'm a citizen of 3 EU countries, I am not British, but I would have voted for Brexit and I would vote for all 3 of my countries to leave the EU, too (well the three countries in question are France, Spain and Germany, so there wouldn't be much of an EU left).

Not because I don't want there to be European collaboration, but because I believe there should a better institution of European collaboration, somewhat closer to what the EEC used to be, that simply has a smaller scope and burden on member countries. Free trade and movement is great, but doesn't require a million rules, a parliament, an army, or any of the Brussels circus for that matter.

That depends, it's not just that really. Living in non-EU Eastern Europe means that getting inside EU is harder than any American can imagine, 98% of all the Americans I've talked to have no idea you have to fill out long and sometimes difficult to obtain Visas in order to visit countries. 

And yet Eastern Europeans are much more bilingual than Americans.

I do agree English being an international language is making it harder for Brits/Americans to learn a new language -- but at the same time, coming from Russia we don't have a minority like the Hispanic minority in the US. We have all sorts Central Asian minorities but they all speak different languages and frankly speaking they don't have much of a culture that would attract any Russian, not like the massive amounts of Spanish-language culture. 

Americans should be a lot more interested in learning Spanish. It's a pretty big, quickly growing and culturally influential minority in the US. It's very useful to speak Spanish in the US.
