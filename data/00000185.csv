In over 20 years, many people have stood where you are and taken in this place - businessmen in suits on their way to work; lovers on the cusp of adulthood, escaping to an intimate retreat; an ocean of travelers, perhaps some in old age and who have since passed.   


Could it be that in twenty more years, someone your age, with his or her own past, memories and experiences, will stop in the same way, and take note of this vast emptiness? Of the rails, passing like the endless timeline of human conceit? The world will be a far different place than it is now. But this metro station, barring a cataclysmic earthquake, mass floods or atomic warfare, will be like many others - largely unchanged.

And my point about the environment was a different one. What is considered ""good for the environment"" is obviously, as all normative questions are, completely subjective. There's no objectively ""better"" or ""worse"" ""environment,"" let alone a global one. Climate change surely benefits some, in their evaluation, and hurts others. Even if ""on net"" (inter-personal comparison and tallying up subjective assessments is dubious, of course) it is ""bad.""

12,"Aye, that is a common point of view in Russia. And especially among the Russian leadership. As the late Polish diplomat and scholar Zbigniew Brzeziński once put very keenly: 

*“It cannot be stressed enough that without Ukraine, Russia ceases to be an empire, but with Ukraine suborned and then subordinated, Russia automatically becomes an empire.”*

The current Russian leadership wishes for nothing more than to restore Russia to its former greatness. They can not do this without Ukraine. Russia's generals know this only too well. Sooner or later, they will come for Ukraine. However, they are not stupid. Quite the contrary. Currently, Russia is not capable of conquering Ukraine. Not because Russia is not strong enough militarily. On the battlefield, Russia could crush Ukraine in a matter of days. But it is all about the economy.

 The re-annexation of the Crimea was a heavy burden on the Kremlin's treasury already. Integrating it into the Russian Federation and upgrading and replacing its old, neglected infrastructure cost a lot of money. Yet these projects are essential for Russia to create and maintain the popular support it needs to keep Crimea under control. After a Russian conquest of Ukraine, similar projects will be needed all across the country in order to appease the Ukrainian people. The Russian economy can not afford such a burden. A Russian annexation of Ukraine would ruin the Russian economy, upsetting the Russian people and likely costing the current Russian leadership their control and position. 

And so the Kremlin waits, keeping Ukraine hostage with the conflict in Donbass until the opportune moment for annexation arises. And they can wait a long time. Russia is a nation of inveterate chess players, especially among its military leadership. They know how to execute long-term strategies.

49,"The Spanish government's handling of the Catalonian independence movement is worse than a human rights outrage; it is a mistake. 

The trial of a dozen separatist leaders on charges including “rebellion” and “sedition”, charges carrying sentences of up to 25 years in prison, ought to be unthinkable in country that is an established member of the European Union and a signatory of the European Convention on Human Rights. 

From the beginning, from the confrontational way in which the Spanish police handled peaceful demonstrations in Catalonia, the authorities in Madrid have got this wrong. They responded to the attempts by the devolved parliament in Barcelona to seek independence with a heavy-handed refusal to respect free expression and democratic, non-violent demands.

The independence movement has not always handled its campaign in the most effective way. The unofficial referendum held in October 2017 was not a good mandate, and the parliament’s declaration of its independence a few weeks later was unwise.

But the central government’s response has been disgraceful. The charges brought against the leaders of the independence movement are plainly political and the long detention of those accused is unjustifiable. It ought to prick the conscience of all Spaniards and indeed all good Europeans that Carles Puigdemont, president of the putative breakaway republic, felt he had to flee the country. 

For a non-violent political dissident to have to seek exile in another EU country – Belgium – is a stain on Spain’s membership of a union supposedly committed to the protection and furtherance of human rights. 

What makes Tuesday’s court proceedings in Madrid so controversial is that, if the defendants are found guilty, they are bound to appeal, eventually to the European Court of Human Rights, where their right to peaceful expression of their views is almost certain to be recognised. 

However, even if the Spanish national authorities refuse to accept that they are on the wrong side of human rights law, Pedro Sanchez, the Spanish prime minister, should realise that this is not the best way to defeat demands for Catalan independence.

We British should resist the temptation to lecture other nations on how to manage national and regional differences within states, but there is something to be learned from the way David Cameron dealt with demands for Scottish independence. He accepted the right of a people to govern themselves, and sought to persuade them in a democratic campaign that they should remain part of the larger union. The idea of making Alex Salmond, first minister of Scotland, a martyr by jailing him was never a remote possibility. 

If Spain's prime minister cannot see that what his government is doing in Catalonia is wrong, he should realise that it is counterproductive and risks storing up much greater trouble for the future.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/aq2oke/spains_trial_of_catalan_separatists_is_a_terrible/egd15ns/,Belgieeuro,1550032607

Unless you are 

**1) collectivist dictator** that would rather everyone lose and stagnate - citizens and businesses - for an misguided ego driven revolutionary ideal (and the power of his clique) rather than integrate with the world economy for the benefit of everyone. 

**2) Iran**, constantly asking for the destruction of America and Israel in their Majlits, constant diplomatic insults, constant funding of Hezbollah through their outposts in Syria, funding of even Hamas and and funding of Houthis. 

There was NOTHING they gave in return for the lifting of sanctions, perhaps just behind closed doors. No changing of discourse, no rational policy. Their adversariality has only gotten more insane.

**How do you deal with these zealots obsessed with the fact Israel exists 2000km from them, raging that Israel is making peace with Saudis, Emiratirs, Kuwait, Iraq, Qatar and even Lebanon ?** 

Iran and Israel used to be borderline allies during Pahlavi's reign, (AS IT IS GEOPOLITICALLY NATURAL) up until the revolution.

JUST ISLAM.** 

Yet still, a measure of normalcy continued. Israel helped Iran in defending from Iraq, **making relations cold with Reagan and the West.**

&gt; Israel's support was ""crucial"" to keeping Iran's air force flying against Iraq. Israeli sales also included spare parts for U.S.-made [F-4 Phantom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas_F-4_Phantom_II) jets. [*Newsweek*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek) also reported that after an Iranian defector landed his F-4 Phantom jet in Saudi Arabia in 1984, intelligence experts determined that many of its parts had originally been sold to Israel, and had then been re-exported to Tehran in [violation of U.S. law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._sanctions_against_Iran).[\[35\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Israel_relations#cite_note-Scott,_Peter_Dale_1987,_p._173-174-35)\[[*copyright violation*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Copyright_violations)\] [Ariel Sharon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariel_Sharon) believed it was important to ""leave a small window open"" to the possibility of good relations with Iran in the future.[\[36\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Israel_relations#cite_note-36)

156,"&gt;Where many women choose for their own happiness to spend more time with their children compared to men? Is this a bad thing?


Not automatically. But you seem to assume with all this that people exist outside a social and economic factors and make decision soley based on personal preference. [Here](https://swaddle-wkwcb6s.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/mother-wage-gap-1.png) some graphs how child-birth impacts earnings of the mother in a couple of countries. Now, some of that might very well be culture caused personal preference...but I'm very skeptical of the notion that a longterm -60% earnings decrease for mothers in Germany is soley or even just primarily result of German mothers being so much keener to be with their children than for example Swedish mothers (which experience ""just"" -20% in earnings) and that this is not to large extend rooted in maternity leave and child care policy which, combined with societal expectations, push mothers more or less into a caring or earners role. 

So, yes, this is mostly child birth related but this has crass ripple effects and I believe its naive to say, faced with crass earning differences of young mothers  in culturally/[economically](https://sekaikyu.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/male_female_employment_rate.gif) relatively similar countries, that women being more or less dominant in many jobs isn't rooted in much more than gendered or just personal preference but for example lacking child care availability and affordability, combined with societal expectations to care personally for children, can significantly contribute to women not pursuing a education and career which they might have wanted to pursue otherwise.

&gt;what you think is the ideal distribution (is it 50/50 across all jobs?) or do you recognise that their are differences across genders in choices and life style and abilities?

​I wrote above:

&gt;I [...] would argue for looking into all jobs where there is a crass gender imbalance(&gt;70-&lt;30% perhaps)...

&gt;Yes, men and women might have slightly different preferences in what to do but dismissing women's absence in certain workplaces on the basis of them apparently not being interested or good enough to be there is willfully ignorant of what else leads to people entering or not entering and staying in jobs.

Personally I wouldn't care about anything withing a 60:40 balance. Take politics, its a traditionally exclusively male profession but starting in the 20th Century that changed slowly in many countries where the EU for example is at around 30% women in national parliaments, while some countries [are now around 50%](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SG.GEN.PARL.ZS?year_high_desc=true), at least going by this example I would argue that societal rules and norms can have tremendous impact on what jobs women choose - Bolivia now has ~53% women in its parliament, that was just 12% in 2000 and for example in the USA (whole of Congress) its just 24%. Or go with programmers...having its roots in the almost entirely female ""computer"" job it used to be dominated by women from the start. But as the profession grew and rose in prominence and wages and developed its own culture you see the share of women declining to pretty low levels, I'm skeptical that being only or just primarily due to women not liking math and or programming.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/apspgu/proportion_of_women_scientists_and_engineers_in/egcqxgq/,Bekoni,1550024594

They're operating within the same institutional framework. Police also technically answers to the designated ministry, it certainly doesn't mean that any sort of abuse of power doesn't happen. What third party, then? Some NGO's? You seem to not understand that this whole issue revolve around the very fundamentals of Norwegian approach and Norwegian law. Every Norwegian ""third party"" will consider Barnevernet actions correct. Every Polish institution/court - won't. Hence the heat.

&gt; No you just don't know anything about this. Every modern country's CPS have strict confidentiality rules, for very good and obvious reasons. Confidentiality exists to protect the children. I'm sure building trust among a bunch of eastern European conspiracy theorists isn't more of a priority than making sure the affected children's identity are protected throughout the case.

I fully understand that it is about privacy. I have worded my point poorly. What I don't understand is why you find it so easy to believe one side, when there are so many complaints. Like do you really believe there's so much serious abuse that justifies taking away the children happening there? Sorry mate, I don't. Here we come to the clash of values point I made previously - for me and other Poles or Eastern Europeans the state should not interfere unless serious shit is happening.

Perhaps better training is required, as i can not understand why the authorities will not allow the Consul to be present a the meeting, when one side of the conflict requested his presence. It would make whole process very clear and free of doubts, when everything is according to local law, the presence of Consul has completely no impact on the matter. But when the authorities insist to keep the man away knowing he has already helped other parents with success, it seems to me that the case is not so obvious. Maybe handling this situation in this way is considered good in Norway, but in my opinion it is not transparent enough to be considered a good practice worldwide. Which I think is important in this discussion, not whether it is legal or not.

I believe that this authority, has protected many abused children and should not be oppressed with such a great amount of hate, but on the other hand it would be beneficial for everyone if whole process would be more transparent.

The EU is slowly dismantling sovereignty of nations, and we've seen that happen before. Apparently people have a really short memory. 

The EU vouched for the filtering of information from the populace, so they can deduce for us what is fake news and what isn't. You cannot name a single person on the planet whom you would let filter information for you, but if its the EU proposing it to you, you barely scratch your head. If anybody proposes to me to filter all the information I get to see, and seriously means it, that person can no longer be trusted. Let alone a conglomerate like the European Union. So don't pretend you don't like to be brainwashed, you are asking for it. Give the EU more power, go ahead, what could go wrong?

368,"&gt;Probably not, there might be some other options between granted self-determination and war. You're ignoring OP's point, though.

I think OP's point is right. Self-determination is not respected in the EU. In fact, it's not respected anywhere else either. It's sad but there are many other state-less nations being oppressed all around the world, the Catalan case is not the only one.

&gt;For what you claim to be applicable, you'd  need provisions and protocols that define how a newly independent chunk  of the supranational organization keeps being part of the group and how  its new legislation and economy interact with  the rest now. These do  not exist currently in the EU.

And that's something we should try to fix, IMHO. Saying countries can only be split or merged by wars is a shame for the humanity. Come on, it's 2019, there should be better ways to handle democratic wills.

&gt;They aren't and it wasn't. In that particular case, Catalonia, along with the rest of the Crown of Aragon of which it was part, supported someone as their preferred king for Spain. They fought for him and lost, and the payback was certainly grim. While self-government lost back then has continuity in current  institutions, to claim that modern Catalonia and its struggles are the  heir of that suppressed Catalonia that somehow survived three centuries  of occupation is as valid as bemoaning the occupation of Spain by the  Bourbons, which continues to this day, too.

That's a good point, but according to your logic, if two countries merge into one peacefully, they shouldn't be allowed to split later if the national majority doesn't want the national minority to leave?

372,"&gt;Neither Russia, nor Ukraine is part of CCM and Russia uses cluster bomb every Friday.

Indiscriminate attacks are an issue, not cluster munitions in general. 

&gt;Its well documented that separatists were placing artillery in vicinity, sometimes literally backyard, of civilian urban areas.

Both sides re purposed civilian infrastructure for military positions, which is withing their rights. 

&gt;Return fire from UA artillery units targeted those

That's a classic piece of their propaganda. It's always ""return fire"". 

I'd pay to see their artillery journals, if the clowns even keep them. 

&gt;What were they supposed to do? 

Firing from a position close to civilian population is not prohibited in itself. 

However, indiscriminate attacks are prohibited, and I think we can agree that blanketing a whole town or neighborhood with MRL fire certainly qualifies.

482,"There are only 36 trade agreements that would affect the EU that are in force in the EU: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_free_trade_agreements

4 of those are British overseas territories and crown dependencies.

The rest represent an insignificant amount of global GDP - with the exception of Japan which has only just come into force. 

The Japanese agreement would also have no bearing on UK trade because of the fact that it has been enforced for around 3 weeks.

There's little to no benefit for the UK to trade with any of these 32 country's (or to reduce existing tariffs) that could not be ratified already.

Infact if you take the trade agreements as a whole, it seems more competitive not to seek trade agreements through the EU as an independant nation, as ratifying multiple agreements with other nation states which represent most of the world's GDP (US, China, India) would be far more profitable.

Either way, the benefit is negligible considering the UK's largest trading partner as a single state is the United States.

As I said before, there is between 2 and 6% of the UK economy that will be directly affected by the loss of EU trade agreements, but free trade agreements with other nation states could more than make up for that loss over the next 25 years.

499,"There are a few things that stand out,

First of all the, and I really have no other word for it, disgusting standpoint you take on the UK's involvement in WW2. It is almost as revolting as American's sometimes take. The UK knew it was next on Hitler's list, hell, it was constantly attacked. This wasn't some 'noble pursuit to save Europe'. It was pure self defence, which is perfectly viable as far as reasons go. Pretending that it was for some 'greater good' is either completely ignorant or downright wrong. You can pick which you prefer.

As far as your 'freely available data' you only linked one source so far, which still places the UK tenth by a quick count of EU countries. And, yet again, **lower than Germany**, which you've claimed several times now is just dumping the immigrants in the UK. So literally by your own source you are wrong.

As far as ""on an overpopulated island"" (again, it's like you don't fact check and take your buzz-words plan straight from FOX news or Breitbart), let's look at the list, shall we?

First, a nice picture to show this ""overpopulated island"" [https://i.imgur.com/irwWOae.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/irwWOae.jpg)

Now, to the numbers. Population density:

UK: 272 per km²

Germany: 230 per km²

Netherlands: 488 per km²

Belgium: 374 per km²

Luxembourg: 207 per km²

&amp;#x200B;

Yet all of these countries contribute more than you. For clarity, this so called ""the future is looking more dangerous"", GPD actually skyrocketed in the very period where most migration took place (1992 to 2000 I believe you stated before?), including in the UK [https://i.imgur.com/2yM7HsS.png](https://i.imgur.com/2yM7HsS.png)

More precise, if not for immigration the birthrate decline would have crippled the UK for decades.

I can keep going. No matter how you look at it, every single one of your facts so far has been demonstrably wrong. I assume you do this to protect yourself from having to admit you're wrong in your beliefs, but I hate to tell you this plainly: by all data, you are wrong.

In islam, man judges and punishes you while you are alive and if you do not believe then if anything you are treated worse.

If you want to look at current threats talk to European businesses that have had technology stolen and/or been forced to hand it over to the Chinese government if they wanted to do business in China.  you might also ask European unions about how they feel about the manufacturing industries that have been lost in Europe.

If you want to look at future threats.  Ask the Dali Lama or any current Chinese neighbors like Nepal, Tibet, Taiwan, Vietnam and all countries around the South China sea how much China respects their territorial rights.  You can look at countries in Africa and the around the Pacific and places like Venezuela that have taken massive loans for infrastructure improvements and are now losing control of their resources such as ports because they are defaulting on loans.

The reason that Huawei is a threat is that it is used by the Chinese government to spy on and gather data on its citizens.  They then use the data to create social scores to control their citizens.  The threat is that Huawei will either steal technology and/or gather data on people both important and common that can be used against them.

So the indifference of the landed gentry first created the famine and then ensured it would continue. 

On discrimination, this was partly caused by a mis-match between the state religion and the de facto religion. The effect was to act as a root for anti-irish sentiment, which was not only commonplace but supported by 'evidence', thanks to the 'science' of eugenics.

office pages.  Annual net migration is the total number of people remaining in a country after considering all those who have left the country. Germany is an outlier in the data due to the bizarre happenings of 2015 onwards. After that, Britain has had approx 280k-360k net annual immigration since 1997.

So following that logic, that's also why those regions separated from Ukraine. 

&gt;For the separatists to have a potential case, they'd have to provide evidence that the new democratic elections were rigged, since they got to vote on it and if it was fair they don't have any case at all. 

Their president was violently removed and had to run from the country. At that point, everything went to shit, Crimea was already done for before the elections elections in Donbass were held in some places, not in others.

649,"&gt;Armed forces is not exclusive to military. 

By definition it is, there are some edge cases (see military police and military fire services in some countries that carry out 'normal' policing duties). But it is not a term used to describe civil police forces.

&gt;And because the forces being trained are going to have arms, they are a force that is armed.

Yes, and is you had said an armed, civilian police force you'd be right, but you use the term 'armed forces' which have a particular definition..

&gt;Additionally, you are able to call terrorist organisations out as such, but refuse to agree above due to it appearing to you as a definition that sacrifices accuracy for the potential of emotional elicitation?

The term 'Terrorism' has a definition, all of those groups fall into that definition. 'armed forces' also has a definition and the police in the UK, including the PSNI don't fall into it. It's be a bit like calling a traffic warden 'a paramilitary', it might well share some of the attributes (hierarchy, uniforms etc..) but not the definition.

&gt; Whilst also denying that british forces are foreign to Irish citizens and their townlands in the north? 

British forces aren't foreign in the UK though are they? And Northern Ireland is part of the UK (and again, the UK's armed forces include people from Northern Ireland..). 

&gt;We are, ourselves, manifesting a microcosm of the central issue. Two incompatible views from two incompatible and fundamentally different people groups.

The difference I think is that to support your view you have to ignore reality. The only way you make the police into an 'armed force' is by twisting the definition, the only way you make the police (or British armed forces) foreign is by ignoring that Northern Ireland is part of the UK.

If instead you were to accept that Northern Ireland is part of the UK, we might be able to look at the actual issues (you know, like Ireland has done and indeed the EU does). I can't help you if you have to redefine a section of the language and make a lot of unsubstantiated territorial claims to get to your point doubly so when even Ireland doesn't..).

&gt; You should pay the taxes where your activity takes place.

And how do we fairly determine that in the example I mentioned above?

Europe will soon realise that trade works both ways and if tarriffs are put on EU imports other markets will be justified.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Ireland#/media/File:Northern_Ireland_Constitutional_Preference.png

20% want a united ireland. From that...

Just below that...

```
An opinion poll of 1,089 people conducted by LucidTalk in 2014 around the time of the Scottish referendum posed several questions. On the question of whether or not there should be a border poll, 47% said ""yes"", 37% ""no"" and 16% ""don't know"".[65] On the question, ""If a referendum on Irish Unity was called under the Good Friday Agreement would you vote: Yes for unity as soon as possible, Yes for unity in 20 years, or No for Northern Ireland to remain as it is"", the results were as follows.[65][66]
```

So what you have is ""Life and time survey"" says 20%(for) or so. The ""LucidTalk"" shows 50/50% +/- 15%. ""OFOC"" shows 60% for a united ireland. But Lord Ashford shows 44%(for) 49%(against). Yet NILT shows 22%(for) and 55% against. YoGov shows 42%(for) 49%(against).

So as I said. You can find any results you like.

Very different when you ask ""Would you vote for a united ireland?"". You get 20% yes from this question. To something like ""Do you think there should be a poll on a united ireland?"" where you get 50% for this kinda question. Or ""Do you think there should be a poll on a united ireland in the event of a no deal brexit"". Which is now mixing leaving the EU with a united ireland which isn't the same thing.

Now...Since I have laid some cards out.... Can you show me some facts that proves the above which is multiple different unreleated independant organizations wrong.... Bear in mind in the last 5 years only 2 surveys say yes there is support for a united ireland but there is 20+ says there is not.

Quite often the question that people are actually saying yes to is ""Do you think there should be a vote?"" Rather than the answer of a vote and this is what SF are using later figure to spin it.

No, all Scottish oil revenue is included in GERS.

&gt;and 50% of our exports goes through English ports and aren’t counted.

No exports are counted in GERS because it's a statement of public sector finances. The Scottish government does have an export statistics publication, that includes goods that go through English ports as Scottish exports. 

&gt;Figures we can verify with credibility are the Irish figures.

OK.

&gt;Ireland has 4% of the Whiskey market and makes 2 billion a year.
Scotland has 84% of the whisky market yet only makes 4 billion a year.

Those figures have no relationship with reality. The Irish whiskey association says Irish whiskey exports are 600 million euros a year. The Scotch whisky association says Scotch exports were £4.36 billion in 2017. 

It also has nothing to do with GERS. GERS is a measure of public sector revenue. 

&gt;GERS and the UK are cooking the books.

The Scottish government, ie the SNP government, is publishing figures to make Scotland's public finances seem worse than they are? Why? 

&gt;You haven’t opened them for scrutiny since 1927 for Scotland. Nor allow us to look at the accounting.

There is no recent data on that, not even recent census data if you want to be crude and assume people would vote along religious lines. Things are very different with the Brexit situation, moderate unionists are more open to the idea of being in a united Ireland and inside the EU than left as part of the UK, outside it.

&gt;Polling of Northern Ireland residents by LucidTalk in December found that - in the event of a so-called hard Brexit with no deal on the border, the Good Friday agreement or citizens’ rights - support for remaining in the EU through reunification with the Republic was marginally greater (48%) than support for staying in the UK (45%)

1117,"&gt; That's because you're from a different culture. You also didn't address  how in this day and age all of the children of said family survive and  they're doing fine financially yet they continue to have so many  children. If it isn't a bad thing why is there so much effort to reduce  birth rates all across the world? 

Well in the very shortsighted term it isn't bad. In the long term tho it's and absolutely horrible and selfish move by him and his wife because they'll create 8 consumers. Who, if they follow in their fathers steps, will create 8 more consumers each and so on an so fort. Couple that with the fact that due to the advance in medicine humans are living longer and longer and this family is actively contributing to the world's overpopulation problem and setting up humanity for a future crisis. Hopefully these children will be smarter than their irresponsible parents and opt to only have 1 child each.

&gt; It applies to men only with the most generous interpretation, how do you explain women having children later and later in life? 

Because they spend their early years in their late teens and early 20s to study and build up a career so they could contribute to the family budget and ensure that more secure and high end lifestyle. Also medicine has progressed a lot so women can safely have children later in life, women can even freeze their eggs to have a child at a later more comfortable date for both them and their spouse.

And lastly this again applies to men too. Most modern men opt to have children around 30 or even later when they are financially stable and ready to support a family.

1157,"Firstly, I'd note you still were unable to provide any sources.

&gt;Well you've made up your mind, like how on earth does priests having to act as translators support YOUR claim?

How on earth does the priest understand and speak Finnish if this was banned? You said this:

&gt;But that's how you do it: *when official business is only allowed in one language* it means that either people need to learn it or they can not fully function in the society.

This is false. Finnish speakers could interact with the officials with their own language if the official spoke Finnish. This was not banned. Like *you could interact with the priest in Finnish, because the priest also spoke Finnish*.

Swedish was the language *within* administration. So if you wanted your cause to be understood within the administration, at some point someone had to translate. Compare this to how we have it in Finland today. While the official languages of administration are Finnish and Swedish, *officials are not banned from speaking English, Arabic or Somali with people.*

&gt;I guess if we removed Swedish from official languages you could easily explain to people why it would not endanger its position and usage in the long run.

Of course it would endanger it. I'm not arguing Finnish language was not endangered. I'm arguing Sweden didn't try to swedisise Finns.

Also, modern times are different, because we don't live in an agricultural society where most people have comparatively little need to deal with the officials, and also today we acknowledge the right to use mother tongue, Swedish already is an established official language, so removing it obviously would seen fennicizing today. But during the Swedish rule, Finnish never reached the status of official language, because things like language rights were not an issue back then. So Finnish not being an official language was not the result of a conscious decision to remove it from official languages, but it was the natural status quo.",Finland,/r/europe/comments/ap38f4/i_just_realized_how_many_islands_there_are_off/egagso1/,Toby_Forrester,1549952952

1177,"&gt; I'd also claim that especially men (but women too) are encouraged to ""live their lives"" before getting kids. I know many 40 year old dudes who haven't even tought about getting kids. When women are most fertile on 20-30 year old it can be a challenge to get the stars to align so that you will get that one kid, let alone several. 

Thanks to technology and medicine, we decreased infant mortality rates, and helped women go trough pregnancy with less issues. Also retirement funds and other social policies helped us focus more on careers.

&amp;#x200B;

That relieved some pressures that women faced about having families. 

25-30 seems like a perfect age, but it gets into dangerous waters at 35-40. It's definitely not a nice moment for a career oriented woman to learn that she can't have kids anymore, when she decides that the time is right.

&amp;#x200B;

I wonder if we can go with technology even further and let women have kids with no issues at 35+. We should think about that, because Europe may get severely depopulated soon.

And to make it more painful, you are not even the only person on the apartment tour more people are present as the competition is high. If you finally find an apartment you like, the realtor will ask you to submit your last 3 salary checks to check you are credible enough to get the contract. Yeaaaah.

Months of trial. More than [500 witnesses](https://www.publico.es/politica/juicio-independencia-apretado-calendario-juicio-proces-meter-500-testigos-11-semanas.html) have to declare, from Mariano Rajoy to Basque President. Lots of [international observers](https://www.eldiario.es/catalunya/politica/Trece-organizaciones-internacionales-reclaman-observadoras_0_862313964.html), including the American Bar Association and the International Federation for Human Rights. There will also be free publicity for far-right VOX, because they are the private prosecution on this trial.

And then all the Spanish politics focused on this. Yesterday we had the demonstration in Madrid from Spanish nationalist parties against Spanish government policy of dialogue with Catalonia, where they also demanded that Catalan leaders on trial must be punished with prison. Also this last week —knowing that this trial will end for sure at the European Court of Human Rights and where things look pretty bad for Spain—, we also had the Spanish president [going to Strasbourg to visit the Court](https://elpais.com/elpais/2019/02/07/inenglish/1549527000_417384.html) in order to ""defend Spanish democracy""; first time in history that a Spanish president visits that court.

If that wasn't enough, just today [Spanish president announced that he may call early election for April 14](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-spain-politics/spains-pm-considers-calling-early-national-election-for-april-14-efe-idUSKCN1Q0192).",,/r/europe/comments/apns7s/hours_before_the_catalan_independence_trial/egaago8/,GulaDelNorte,1549946460

1227,"&gt; Yeah well maybe that's the issue. You see, let's take the glyphosate. Is it bad? Yes it is a catastrophy for the environnement.

Citation needed.

As far as I know, the toxicity of it is quite low. The glyphosate debate has been an absurdity in France and it's been sad to watch. As much as I don't like Monsanto, they do not even have the patent on Roundup anymore, and GMO are not allowed in France (another stupidity by the way given how much of it we import already)

In general, relying on the common wisdom of the population is a terrible idea. On social points, you'd have 30 years delay compared to most countries (death penalty might come back for instance, most polls show appreciation of it. Voting rights for women would have come much later, like they did in Switzerland)

On technical points, it is even worse. This distrust in experts is very alarming, and has been one of the strongest talking points of campaigns for Brexit and Trump. It is the same mechanism behind anti-vaxxers, and I blame social media for it.

Finally, I live in Switzerland (as a French). Their political system has its pros and cons, but it has nothing to do with how much money they earn. Also it relies on citizen actually being educated to this system, you can not improvise it. I was listening to the Swiss radio recently and they were laughing at the idea that French people would use it. I mean, some years ago they voted against having more holidays (https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/switzerland/9138137/Swiss-vote-against-taking-more-holiday.html).

The RIC is not a magical solution and would be a disaster, bringing even more importance to short term politics. But eh, I don't live there anymore, and given the importance of the yellow vests movement, it doesn't make me want to come back anytime soon.

McDonald's lost the case not because they didn't have a claim, but because of the EUs rules regarding evidence in a trademark case. In fact had they presented the right evidence they probably would have won that particular battle. The case can be appealed. EU Trademark appeals courts allow additional evidence to be presented on appeal at the judges discretion. So we will see what happens. 

It's also important to note that the request to revoke is a seperate action to McDonald's trying to get an injunction preventing Supermac's expansion.

&gt;Norway's Barnevernet: They took our four children… then the baby
&gt;
&gt;The case of a young couple in Norway whose five children were taken away by the state has fuelled mounting concern within the country and abroad over its child protection practices. Protesters around the world - and leading Norwegian professionals - say social workers are often too quick to separate children from their families, with too little justification, particularly when parents are immigrants.

-

&gt; They were suspected of administering corporal punishment, and in Norway, that's completely illegal.

Hmm.  This is legal in all US states.  It appears to be illegal in about half of the EU.

In the UK we used to have what are known as the “ceremonial counties” which were drawn along the lines of the old feudal holdings. Most of them have been replaced by more representative administrative counties. Sure the people of Rutland or wherever still see themselves as being Rutlanders, with unique heritage and traditions, and they are. But it’s delusional to try and keep a system built for an undemocratic time which has long since died.

Imo the “nations” are just the big brothers of the old ceremonial counties. If we hadn’t gone plunging ahead and ended up creating a precedent for having regional governments on national boundaries, we could have built the thing from scratch. But now we’re stuck with another faulty system of regional governments which are essentially playing out a pantomime of the old mediaeval system.

That was Germany. And it was a case of supervised visitation. Makes sense to ban a language that the supervisor doesn't understand.

[France had a state of emergency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_of_emergency_in_France), that was extended 5 times and lasted 2 years (Nov 2015 - Nov 2017). After it, they added new laws that were widely criticized, [for example](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-41493707). This article from the BBC has a ""wonderful quote"":

&gt; Interior Minister Gérard Collomb told parliament on Tuesday that the threat level was still ""very serious"", saying: **""We're still in a state of war.""**

I dont know about you, but I wouldnt call that ""having things in order.""

&gt; Mine was a true question about this.

My answer was also genuine, if it came off any other way - that wasnt my intention.

&gt; A generation whose highest ambition is social security, ie getting bailed out by the state? Where's the ambition in wanting to be given money due to unemployment?

Its more complicated then that. The article describes what it was like under the previous government: 

&gt; the economy grew, but not the younger generation's economic security. Youth unemployment peaked at more than 27 percent in 2013. Young Poles ended up on temporary contracts and their wages were lower than they had hoped. 

The issue wasnt a lack of ambition, it was a lack of opportunities (other than emigrating). The issue was that despite this situation, the approach the government had was its infamous ""warm water in the tap"" (no real program, things will slowly improve by itself, only thing they can guarantee is warm water in the tap). That was not good enough for the younger generation. If anything, its because people had ambitions that they didnt accept this approach.

Well I looked into this tire regulation thing, now I tell I don't know anything about cars but here what it says :  ""The Act mandated the use of a suitable **TPMS** technology in all light motor vehicles (under 10,000 pounds), to help alert drivers of under-inflation events. ... For N1 vehicles, **TPMS**are not mandatory, but if a **TPMS** is fitted, it must comply with the **regulation**. ""  Now i googled what low presure tires mean how are they a problem for a driver and here's what came up "" **If tire pressure is too low**, then **too** much of the **tire's** surface area touches the ground, which increases friction between the road and the **tire**. As a result, not only will your **tires** wear prematurely, but they also could overheat. Overheating can lead to tread separation — and a nasty accident.  ""    So basically all this regulation does is prevent you have an accident by letting you know of the tires pressure. How is this bad? Does it adds more money to spend on the car for the driver? probably, haven't look to see how much they cost, but is that really the isssue here when it helps save your life and prevent an possible accident?

&gt;As long as he can feed them he can have 50 if he wants, but that fact neither impresses me as a man, nor do I see it as a great achievement. It's neither good nor bad, it's their choice.

That's because you're from a different culture. You also didn't address how in this day and age all of the children of said family survive yet they continue to have so many children. If it isn't a bad thing why is there so much effort to reduce birth rates all across the world?

1644,"Yes, great comment, good points. Also there is so heartbreakingly many couples struggling with fertility issues that has nothing to do with age. I feel like there is way too little discussion of how much i.e weight and healthy living habits affects fertility. 


&gt;Both women and men can have fertility issues, specially if they start trying later in their lives.

It's so great that you added men too! It genuinely blows my mind how insanely many men are completely, and I mean completely, blissfully unaware of the fact that their fertility and sperm quality declines too with age. Yes it's not in the same way than women, but the risks definitely are there. The father's age affects everything from the time how long it takes to get pregnant (if you can get pregnant at all) to the risk of miscarrying to the health of the child. I have not once met a woman in my life who doesn't know the fact that her fertility declines with age, but the amount of older men who for some reason have this unwanted need to tell you how they are searching for a younger partner to have kids with ""some day"" is pretty crazy. Many men even in their 40s seem to think they have all the time in the world.

But this is part of a larger picture, that being how uneducated people are of the very basics what comes to reproduction. You can stop the average childless person on the street and they very likely couldn’t tell you what lochia is or what are the stages of spontaneous vaginal delivery (i.e how a normal birth roughly goes). Just some examples, comparing to how people being stopped and asked about i.e contraceptives and STDs would have a different outcome.

&gt;So if you spend your twenties/early thirties studying, trying to establish yourself professionally, securing yourself financially (getting a stable home for yourself) and looking for a reliable partner, it may just happen that you for example end up with just one kid instead of two that you would ideally want to have.

Yes. If you wait for the “perfect” setting, the perfect time might never come. But perfect isn’t really even realistic, for many people it would just “not struggling”. There are so many factors, it’s not an easy subject.

1724,"&gt;but doesn't that prove that we only breed for our own benefit?

Some humans in the modern day, might breed for their own selfish reasons. I.e get extra hands on a farm or have someone to take care of them when they die or just out of sheer boredom.

Capitalist minded people might want new consumers and labor.

Military minded people might want bigger manpower to their armies.

Welfare state -minded people want more taxpayers.

But! Breeding itself is not selfish. Most if not all selfish reasons for breeding are man made. Most animals don't think much about it. It just happens.

Ants, bees and maybe some higher order primates might get advantage from numbers, but hey are not cognizant of it.

And yes. Most animals breed until they reach the carrying capacity of their particular ecological, but we can't really blame them. It just feels natural to them.

When i said: ""I see life as a magnificent marvel and a rebellion against the infinite cold universe.""

I meant that that is my rational for respecting and valuing life itself. Whether it's microbial life, plants, insects, fungi, mammals or even humans. 

I understand that it can sometimes be really difficult to come up with reasons to continue existing. Individually, and as a species. Especially as a humans. Since we are presumably the only ones who have the capacity understand the futility of this all. (Or maybe we are the dumb ones? Maybe all animals have already evolved in a way that they've gotten rid of conscience, so they can survive without these thoughts /s)

&gt;besides, what if you don't end up happy after you have children, then you're back where you started except there are now more people with that problem in existence.

This is a very plausible outcome.

I really can't tell. It is all the same whether humans exist or not. Or if life itself exists, in any form.

&gt;or what if your children are even less happy/more unhappy with their lifes?

My children might be less happy or as unhappy as i am. Or they might be happier than i am. 

I guess that would depend on what personality affecting genes they inherit from me and my possible future wife. 

Environmental factors play their part in human happiness of course. But judging from how we humans have been able to exits for hundreds of thousands of years in all kinds of conditions. With every generation having some portion of the population being moody, neurotic, introverted, melancholic people who have suffered existential troubles. 

&gt;you talk about deadly sins but you don't even seem to consider just how selfish it is to force another life into existence.

There has always been happiness and sorrow. But i have to add. And yes. This is a selfish reason produced by my human mind. Both kinds of people are needed for survival of the species. Neurotic people, although they suffer a lot of existential crises, are very important at detecting risks. Happy people who love living have unbelievable capacity to listen, react and overcome these risks. (Although they are insufferably slow to react..)

So yeah. Life is suffering to *some* people. I guess some of us just need to learn to love the suffering. It can be fulfilling. But i admit. It is not something i wish for my children. 

Then again. Since i have a natural inclination towards melancholy, that my parents didn't have, i was not properly raised to handle this kind of personality type. Luckily i have the foresight to understand that my child might have similar personality to that of my own. Therefore i plan to teach my children the necessary tools to mitigate the suffering that is existence. Who knows. Maybe he or she won't suffer at all. 

Is it selfish to give life? or selfish to deny a chance for a new life? If only my genes could talk... Some of the genes might yell: 

-""NO! Do not reproduce us! Life is horrible. We have been here for 4 billion years. We know for sure that it is horrible!"" Other genes might be yelling: -""Go on! Do it. It's awesome! We wan't to go for another round!""

I really don't know the answer. So i just quote Shakespeare:

&gt;""To be, or not to be, that is the question:
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles""

Just because it's not legally binding, doesn't mean it's not a directive. We live in a democracy, and if the public votes for something, it's generally accepted that the government/Parliament should carry it out. 

&gt; You just wrote above that Parliament can't be bound, not even by itself.

I also wrote that it was a political necessity, as opposed to a legal one. 

&gt; Says who? You? It was a major issue.

Says who? You? Did you not follow the indy ref? It was generally accepted that leaving the UK also meant leaving the EU, at least for some time. Of bigger concern was the currency, apparent monetary union, border controls with the south, and citizenship. If you look at the Ashcroft poll, the biggest issues were tax, pensions, money, and the NHS - the EU wasn't a particularly important issue. 

&gt; Is there any evidence to support your assertion here?

Yeah, all the polls that say Scotland hasn't changed its mind. They're on wikipedia, look them up. 

&gt; Before I answer that

Okay, so either there isn't one or you're just assuming I'm retarded. Moving on then. 

&gt; Why do they need to be 100% behind it? If I show polls that demonstrate my argument, are you going to shift the goalposts?

Polls without campaigning are probably going to be different to polls now, but I suspect that polling the RoI before telling them of monetary issues are going to be fairly different to when they realise they'll lose 10% of GDP (actual GDP, ignoring all the tax haven stuff). It's a moot point anyway, as I only said that they're not 100% behind it. Sure, they're generally pro-unification, but I expect support would drop in the run-up to an actual vote, considering the shitstorm that'd follow. 

&gt; You're assuming a lot in this discussion. If Scotland and Ireland leave, causing the economy to nosedive even more, what makes you think that Wales would feel the same as they do now? Again, you're acting like things are set in stone, and that things will be the same no matter what. 

It's ironic that you say I'm assuming a lot, when you're (falsely) claiming that the economy is nosediving, and would nosedive even more if Scotland/NI left. If they did leave, the rUK economy would pick up, since Westminster would be able to lower taxes due to less subsidies, and all the Scottish businesses that said they'd move south in the event of independence, would move south. 

&gt; what makes you think that Wales would feel the same as they do now

What makes you think they'd change their minds? Despite the rise of nationalism, devolution, and the constant efforts of Plaid Cymru, the Welsh are relatively apathetic to the idea of independence. 

&gt; Well, no, what's preposterous is your continued dismissal of all the warning signs that the country is in an existential crisis

After Italia has cowardly changed sides in WW1, they got these predominantly slavic populated territories as a war booty from their ex-allies Austria-Hungarian, who dismemberd after losing in WW1. In years to come, Slavic people of these regions where victims of brutal fascistic oppresion and of italianisation untill the fall of fascistic Italy in 1943. After the WW2, these territories became part of victorious Yugoslavia and tables has turned for fascistic oppressors and for all italian civilians who supported fascistic regime.

Finland. You know, the country we're discussing in this thread.

&gt;Maternity leave is still called maternity leave for a reason and even willing men often can't because bosses won't allow or they just freeride it anyway. 

All employers are legally mandated to allow all their employees to take leave for the child. I'd like to see the source for your claim that they're routinely breaking the law.

&gt;they just freeride it anyway.

1832,"&gt;The Scottish Parliament can't solely legislate for a referendum, but it is required to legislate in order to hold one. 

Scottish parliament legislation isn't required for a referendum on Scottish independence. Not legally, anyway. Westminster could legislate for such a referendum on its own. I don't think it would, for obvious reasons.

&gt;If they did pass a referendum Act, then Westminster would follow.

The Scottish parliament almost certainly can't pass a referendum act. It doesn't have the power to do so. 

&gt;Right, but they weren't forced into it, like they were by the Scottish Parliament/SNP.

They weren't forced into it by the Scottish parliament, either. They could have said no. 

The point is saying no when there is public support for something is likely to increase the support for it, and the longer it goes on, the more support will grow. Cameron delayed a referendum in his first term, by saying now is not the time (just as May has done now). But that's not a strategy that can be continued indefinitely. 

&gt;Because in one case, a party with a manifesto commitment to hold a referendum won an election and formed a government with enough strength to pass a referendum Bill.

Passing a referendum bill is beyond their legislative competence. Cameron wasn't compelled to agree a Scottish independence by law, he was compelled by the politics of denying a referendum on something that clearly had significant support. That goes equally for Brexit (more so, as Brexit clearly had more support).",,/r/europe/comments/apewm8/nicola_sturgeon_scotland_will_be_independent_in/eg8bkff/,WhiteSatanicMills,1549901063

Could you elaborate?

&gt; The west objectively hates Russia and Russians and wants its destruction.

Not entirely. Even if I stand alone, in the West, without hating Russia and wanting it's destruction, I break your statement. But, people don't hate Russia. I have a friend who worked in St Petersburg and admires your fellow countrymen incredibly. What I hate is the constant aggression, almost like a big cat, waiting for you to turn your back so that it can pounce. It's hard to be friends with someone unpredictable.

&gt;I'd call it rather wealth transfer. East gets a bit richer. West gets poorer. If both had same high standards, there'd be much less incentive to move out. So yes, West would probably be a wee richer. But East would just stay as poor. Same dynamics is in EU/USA&lt;-&gt;Asia.

The common good that you damage is the common environment.

&gt;Well, we're getting access specifically because companies are leaving countries with high regulations. 

The access is predicated on common regulatory standards. We'll just have to tighten those then.

&gt;More like person A robs a bank. Person B doesn't see other ways to get rich aside from robbing a bank. Person A lives off his past robberies and doesn't understand why person B wants to rob a bank too. Why can't he live off money he made in the past?

Because robbing banks has negative effects, we know now. We didn't know then. Worse, it's cumulative so the first damage is limited, but all the added damage is worse per unit.

You cannot separate the benefits of that bankrobbing from the legitimate efforts either. So you're essentially asking for a blank cheque.

I think that you have to say ""person B doesn't *want* to see other ways to get rich"". Again, capital and technology are available now, which weren't available in the past.

&gt;It's only for big companies with stable and high volume traffic. And going long distance. For small businesses trucks or even vans is much more efficient. Paving 1km of road, which you need anyway for employees and emergency services and whatnot, is much cheaper than 1km of rail or canal.

1964,"&gt; Member states play a hugely important role in EU decision-making, but too often they act as middlemen for corporate interests. This new report combines case studies, original research, and analysis to illustrate the depth of the problem - and what you can do about it.

&gt; Corporate lobbies are actively influencing decision-making, via national ministers and officials, to ensure that EU laws and policies suit them. These corporate lobbies include famous national brands such as Volkswagen and Telefónica; iconic sectors like the finance industry in the City of London or the Polish coal industry; and high-spending EU trade associations such as BusinessEurope and CEFIC (the European Chemicals Industry Council). And whether it is on climate change, finance, chemicals, data privacy, or many other issues, when corporate interests win, the public interest loses out.

Here is a simple conceptualisation.

If you consider an article of clothing to be oppressive, you do not free anyone by making it illegal to wear it. 

It's not even this as a philosophy though. Because this is not something that needs to be theorised. Army banned headscarves here, you know what it resulted in? More women clinging to their headscarf as part of their identity, many of whom which would probably not wear it if they didn't feel they were being oppressed.

""The society"" is nothing but the sum of all the ""normal average men and women"". It's true that in most cases a husband simply can't afford to be the single payer, but you can't deny the change in gender roles either. Most women don't want to stay at home. The old paradigm of marrying, having children and women staying at home by default is over. People's lives have become much more individualistic. They don't feel like having children is the default anymore. In the end it's both: a financial struggle as well a change in mentality. 

The possibilities of ""the government"" on the other side are limited. Sure, you can increase child benefits and make child care free, but this won't be the deciding factor. Poland for example offers negative taxes for married couples with children, but their birthrate is even lower than that of Germany or Austria.

Back in the early 2010s Finland was still one of the highest in Europe. Then around mid 2010s (~2014 to be exact] there was a turning point and since then it's been getting worse and worse.


I am a young woman who talks a lot with other young women, and the amount of reasons I know people aren't having kids is crazy. Everything from not feeling safe to not just wanting to be a mom. Also there are those who want babies but don't have a good partner, and women can't just multiply by ourselves, no matter how much the focus seems to be on women than it might it seem like it. If you don't have a good man there is no point and no idea of having a baby.


However it's kind of funny to see feminism being blamed in every single of these charts. Fertility rates in Europe are higher in countries where women go to work after having babies. This isn't fixed by making women stay home (like I suggested in my last comment about this subject, I refuse to start using /s in here).


Time will tell if this is just one phase. Like i.e Denmark had a very low fertility throught the 1980s, worst being the total fertility rate of 1,38 in 1983.

1. They already know the climate is going to shit, but thanks for the assumptions about my family anyway

2. You do not change the mindset of people, that they have had for decades before you were born, just by talking

3. They will never, ever have the same stakes in our future than the younger generations, in the same way that we will never, ever have the same stakes as our children (provided that we have them in the first place). By the time I am scheduled to retire (~ the mid 2060's), southern Europe will already be much more arid than now, tropical nights much more common, etc. My grandparents have about a 0,0000001 % chance to be alive then, as they would be supercentenarians, and my parents' would be more like ~10 %, as they would be nearly centenarians themselves. They naturally cannot project themselves into such a future, because they won't know it. They (not incorrectly) assume that by 2050 they will be either dead, or senile. In 2050 I'll be 53, and following life expectancy trends, I might very well die in the 2080's or early 2090's. The chance that I live to the year 2100 (I'd be aged 103) are rather tenuous.

Main topic : the Benalla Case

Other topics: 

-Yellow Vests, week 13: another young man lost a hand due to a grenade. (5th case). There was also a national strike. Macron carried on with his 5-hours-long televised 'debate' shows. His popularity polls are improving, but so are the ones about the Yellow Vests... The ""anti-rioters"" law passed in the National Assembly. 

-search at Manuel Bompard's home (he's a member of 'far-left' party ""France Insoumise"")

-A MP was accused of sexual harrassment and sexual assault in 2016 (before Me Too) by several female colleagues. He filed a defamation case against them and the newspaper that published the story. (The women didn't press charges because the facts were too old). The trial was this week: it backfired against him. He didn't even attend it. His lawyer was bad. A major political figure who until then had not complained about him revealed he assaulted her as well, at a time when she just had a baby and he was about to get married to a close friend of hers. He didn't win.

-""Lol League"": it was revealed that a bunch of young men working in journalism or communication and who were the ""kings"" of Twitter at its beginnings around 2009-2012 harrassed multiple people. Mainly women, also a few men. They would make coordinated attacks:  sexist (or homophobic, racist, antisemitic) """"""jokes"""""", porn montages, and also on several occasions """"""prank"""""" them by pretending to offer them a job. Now many of these dudes work at high positions in progressive newspapers. Basically they bullied their ways to the top of the parisian elite, many people knew, it was swept under the rug. For the past 2 days they have published ""apologies"" in which they mostly make it about them and how the climate was different at the time and they didn't realize how it affected their victims. Which is a big lie. 


-Tensions with Italy. France asked its ambassador to leave the coutry in protest. 

-Big  fire in Paris = 10 deaths. The culprit is a woman with a heavy history of psychiatric issues. People working in pyschiatric services have coincidentally been alerting and protesting for months about their working conditions.

Another one I also already mentioned: America is successful in brain-draining the world. Good for them, but there is simply no way all countries can be successful in a same way. It's like tax haven - if your are already tax haven and there are few tax havens throughout the world, it works, but it's not the way that could be emulated by all countries. The supply of brains is limited.

Another one are social benefits still lower than in Europe: The hardworking people believing in self still view America as the ideal country and are more motivated to immigrate there.

2343,"Since Iceland is never really talked about here, and I'm sure none of you have heard of this, I'm going to do a deep-dive into the KlausturGate issue which has been going on for quite a while now;

This was supposed to be a TL;DR version of events, but a lot has happened, bless this mess;

Members of Parliament, from a few different Political parties got drunk at a bar called 'Klaustur' ergo KlausturGate, anyways, they said awful things about just about every female member of Parliament, commenting on their looks, calling a certain member of Parliament a 'Cunt' iirc and lots more.

They were secretly recorded by a patron of the bar (To be fair, they must have been talking VERY loudly in order for her old ass phone to record their voices so clearly, but I digress)

The (female) patron that recorded them then came forward with the recording and it caused a fucking shitshow the size of France.

(One thing I don't like about it is how the Patron came forward with her name and all, and didn't just stay anonymous, thus allowing us to keep the focus on the actual tape and not the person who recorded it. But whatever, you gotta make money somehow.)

The PM's were VERY quickly recognized by their voices and outed, they did not really offer much of an apology when confronted about their assholery, causing more ire.

They were then put on (unpaid) leave for a few weeks.

Some of the dicks on the tape then had the tremendous gall to sue the woman who recorded them in order to shift some of the attention onto her, and not them. This of course did not work, since that's a fucking stupid idea.

Generally, their plan seems to be to draw even more attention to their lack of respect for any and all vagina-owning members of the general population by repeatedly attacking the woman that recorded them.

&amp;#x200B;

Parliament then went on Christmas break, the matter was discussed and argued about endlessly on RÚV including when the Minister for Education called the KlausturCunts 'Thugs' on National television, Parliament then went back into session after the Holiday break.

There have also been many, *many* protests and probably some hashtags, because let's be honest, there's always a goddamn hashtag.

&amp;#x200B;

The MP's that were on the tape did not step down, did not really apologize in any way, and in fact have since returned to their Parliamentary duties, even though no-one actually likes them, this caused yet another shitstorm on Icelandic FaceBook/ Twitter.

Some female MP's then went on Ríkisútvarpið, or RÚV, the National TV station where most people get their news, and commented on the issue and their objections to these KlausturFucks returning to their duties.

One of the people involved then got on a pretty popular talk-show and discussed the matter, offering no real apology, or really showing that he regrets what he did in any way (cunt).

More recently, some members of the Pirate Party did a silent protest of sorts when one of the main members of the KlausturShit debacle was speaking in Parliament, this protest involved hats with 'FO' meaning 'Fuck Ofbeldi' / English; 'Fuck Violence' 

This protest was of very little value, since it was the Pirate Party and they are morons, but that's just my opinion.

2351,"&gt;	Organic farming is about not relying on ‘external’ inputs for food production. You can argue with that, but that’s the central dogma in organic farming.

What? No its not. Organic farming uses  ‘External’ inputs like fertilisers and pesticides just like conventional farming. In many cases it uses a lot more because the tools being used are less efficient. If you use poop as fertiliser for instance you need a lot more fertiliser than you would need if you just used normal fertilisers. A lot of organic farming used copper sulfate instead of glyphosate. This is a lot more toxic to the environment and you need more of it, but I guess it is ‘natural’ which is why the toxic part doesn’t count? 

This stuff definitely needs to be trucked in. Organic farms can’t produce nearly the amount of poop that you need, so obviously that comes from the big factory farms. Copper sulfate doesn’t grow on trees either.

I think you are projecting onto organic what you want it to be. Organic is more wasteful farming, where we use inneficient old processes which use more resources. The upside is that people prefer older processes because they feel it tastes better, is healthier, or is better for the environment.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/ap44s0/austria_leads_the_way_in_organic_farming/eg7j5nb/,Leprecon,1549866694

With better quality of life, that child mortality is going down, but it takes a generation or two for birth rate to adapt to that. So you end up with a phase of severe population growth. That phase is only temporary, though. 
As is said, birth rate has already started to decline in Africa, even in Niger (steady drop from 7.88 in 1982 to 7.24 in 2016).
Granted, it doesn't drop quite as fast as other african countries, so we might have to do some checking and find out what's hampering the decline.  ",,/r/europe/comments/ap6jk0/viktor_orbán_no_tax_for_hungarian_women_with_four/eg7j9gx/,mrspidey80,1549866824

Price supports would literally just encourage overproduction and would prevent bad farmers from going out of business. There’s a reason we got rid of price supports in the first place.


You have literally no conception about how agriculture works. The reason that so many family farms disappeared following World War II was because of mechanization, tractors, and scale. These people had to fucking go. My grandparents were all born on farms. You don’t see anyone in our family picking cotton any more like in the 1950s because that’s all done with fucking tractors now.


It takes very little labor to farm. That’s why there’s only like 2% of the population are farmers. Modern tractors are literally GPS guided and drive themselves. You have this childish conception that the US taxpayer is going to start subsidizing millennials to move to the middle of nowhere and start milking cows by hand again instead of with robots so we can all pay twice as much for milk.

2564,"&gt; Like the basic premise of free trade is that different countries prosuce and export the goods that they have a competitive advantage in. 

It's that you export in things that you have a *comparative* advantage in.  Sure, you get the largest benefit if you can trade for anything, without restriction.  But even if we *only* traded with the EU in shoes and cars, we could still expect to benefit, because it's a good bet that one has a higher relative opportunity cost versus the other for each party.

True, about 75%, however the developong world is so massive and growing at such a rate that in 20 years they will have outpaced us:

They will have essentially done more damage in 50 years than we did in 200.

This was true before we were developed even. In fact since we have become developed, the large majority of these species are coming back in the developed world.

&gt; Afaik coral bleaching is a consequence of warming seas, no? 

It's due to many reasons, such as increased ocean acidity from more CO2 in the atmosphere, or dumping of toxic chemicals into the ocean, or you know, physical destruction to build military bases: https://edition.cnn.com/2017/03/29/opinions/south-china-sea-coral-reef-destruction/index.html

&gt;I’m not saying developing shouldn’t care about pollution, I’m just saying we have polluted a lot more; and for a lot longer, to blame global warming on the developing countries.

The issue is that people mix up pollution with emissions. We have, for the time being anyway, emitted more CO2 than they have. The crucial point however, is that they are having a much larger and more permanent impact on the environment than we ever had, mainly because of the use of heavy industry (i.e. toxic chemicals) and plastic on another scale, but also due to intensive industrial farming. Not only that, but in the next 20 years they will have emitted more as well.

2737,"&gt; The UK is trying to conclude a deal with the EU because the majority of MPs would rebel over a no deal. Not because May has any particular respect for remain.

May wanted to remain, she wants a soft brexit, she has made that repeatedly clear. The UK is pursuing a deal because that is what makes sense for the UK (and the EU..). MP's can't 'rebel' over no-deal, it's simply what happens if there isn't a deal, they need to agree a deal if they want to avoid no deal..

&gt;Have yet to see a dangerous and deranged fundamentalist of remain. 

Really? You missed the bit where they were calling for the rejection of *any* deal with the EU, in the hope that the prospect of no-deal would mean no-brexit? Or those that have suggested that the UK should remain and never ask again? Those seem pretty fundamental.

&gt;Plenty of dangerous Leavers tho.

I suppose it rather depends on whether you want to see the UK remain in or leave the EU. There seem to be any number of idiots on both sides though.

&gt;The ERG are not in charge, true, and yet May only speaks with them and embraces their position instead of the moderates in her party. 

Erm.. I mean, that's just not true, I'm not really sure where to go with something that blatantly made up, I'm reasonably sure even the Guardian and Independent wouldn't make that claim.

&gt;Which makes it doubly infuriating. It doesn't help that the ERG has pretty much invaded every possible UK media outlet.

And another one.. Most of the UK press is either moderate or remain leaning. The ERG is pillories pretty constantly, as is Reese-Mogg.  Where are you getting this from?

Whether or not Portugal recognizes Guaido makes absolutely no difference. It’s just one small country or of dozens recognizing Guiado.


If Maduro actually started some ridiculous pogrom against Portuguese people, then that would be amazing because it would give Brazil and the US a great excuse to actually invade Venezuela.


How the hell do you think the Brazilians with a far-right president would react if a neighboring Spanish speaking country started rounding up Portuguese speakers for the sole purpose of persecuting Portuguese speakers? 


If Maduro started targeting Portuguese citizens in Venezuela then (1) it would accomplish nothing in the grand scheme of things since Portugal is just one small country, and (2) it would give foreign countries an real good excuse to invade Venezuela.

2900,"&gt; That's funny coming from the guy who thought saying ""Do your own research"" was enough

TBH someone else said you that. Take a closer look at usernames.

&gt; But you don't even seem to understand that technological development is about future possibilities, about knowing things that we don't know yet.

Yet projects in that list seem to be rehashing other ideas rather than exploring future possibilities. Can't wait to see graphene battery prototypes I was promised 5 or 10 years ago.

&gt; You only seem willing to go ""Oh, well what we have now is not enough, so there's no point to developing it""

My point was specifically that we need a major breakthrough. Existing tech, which we keep iterating in build-bigger-and-more style isn't going to cut it.

&gt; Now piss off and go find something less annoying to do to entertain yourself

I'll assume you'll change your mind when you go up your thread and learn someone else told you to ""do your own research"". If not, go fuck yourself and learn to stay calm.

2902,"I don't have a clear-cut position on that, because the European Council losing power goes in hand with the EU moving towards federalism. Since I think that EU's current rules are bad, I am wary about removing power from member states. But rules turned bad in the first place *because* of a geopolitical and ideological balance skew coupled with member states pursuing their own interests.

Another reason is that removing power from member states *may not* fix the skews I mentioned, but on the other hand it *will* remove the ability from member states and their populations to resist them. So there I would only support more federalism if there is also direct democracy.

&amp;nbsp;

Electing the President of the European Commission through direct universal suffrage means granting him a lot of power. It would make European policy *much* more clear and predictable to European citizens, who right now vote and have no idea what it will actually mean in the end, because the Lead Candidate system continues to define policy *after* votes have been cast, trying to strike deals to grab a majority.

Direct suffrage means that the European Parliament's role will need to be clarified though, because it will be weakened and and the European Council will also be weakened informally. Power could need to be balanced away from the Commission President. I think it's still more interesting than Lead Candidate but would circle back this comment to see my earlier concern with federalism.",,/r/europe/comments/ap2s2u/german_cdu_chief_europe_must_adapt_to_survive/eg61nhk/,_Handsome_Jack,1549821758

I think this is largely a case of believing your own propaganda rather than anything else.

The difference is that the pro-EU media in the UK, and the media in general in places like Germany and France are highlighting it more.  The UK is however a massive provider of aid, good at diplomacy, and about to be able to mate trade, aid, hard power and diplomacy...

3064,"Regardless, I still think Markovic would succeed. EEC (EU) offered Yugoslavia $4.5 billion ($8.6 billion in 2019) for structural reforms. But Milosevic and Serbs were too busy hijacking Yugoslavia in order to see this. Yugoslavia could have been saved and reformed with the help of EU if there was no Milosevic. It would have been better for everyone today, including EU. Yugoslavia now would probably be net contributor. Europe already has federal and confederate states and they work fine, there was ZERO reason why Yugoslavia would not. 

Political reform was necessary, Slovenian and Croatian representatives insisted on this - they wanted to save Yugoslavia BUT as a confederate state. But Milosevic's defiance made them seek support from Germany for independence. When Belgrade sent tanks to Slovenia and Croatia it was the end for Yugoslavia.  

I know plenty of Serbs like to say ""federation was necessary, confederate Yugoslavia would fell apart after some time"" and my response is - no. As the time would go on, it would have been more and more unprofitable for individual republics to seek independence - especially after 2004 when Yugoslavia would become a member of EU. If Slovenia asked for independence, they would become non-EU and would need to go through all hurdles once again while Yugoslavia would remain in EU and could have blocked their accession. No responsible government would do that to their own nation.

Overall, existence of Yugoslavia would benefit everyone. Today they would import workers from Ukraine and Asia instead of exporting their own people to wealthy EU states.",Pan-European nationalist,/r/europe/comments/ap2l5v/tito_the_barman_1955/eg5t8ew/,1step_closer,1549815206

3069,"&gt;Technical or not, Italy is in recession.

Right, and Germany only just missed that (may even turn out to have been depending on how the figures are revised) France is in a similar situation. The UK may be once it has left the EU, but it isn't currently.

&gt;And despite the unhinged cretin that couldn't bite his hands, it's not because of the EU. While the UK, on the other hand, had a bit of luck last year, but eventually that is running out.

The UK hasn't had a 'lucky year' it has however been through a fairly long period of restructuring and is arguably in a better position to weather a recession than most of the larger Eurozone members (arguably the no-deal prep that firms have done will actually help with that..). But just to be clear, Italy isn't in recession because of the EU, nor is Germany's situation a result of the EU, broadly the causes are global and relate to manufacturing and export issues. Germany and Italy are far more exposed to that than the UK is, and they are far more exposed to each other.

And that is where the EU (and more importantly the Eurozone) is a factor, if Italy fucks up, it'll hit Germany by dint of being part of the same currency union, and it'll have a far more major impact on the rest of the EU because their markets are massively more integrated.. Now if the UK were as integrated and dependent  on the single market, or if the UK were in the Euro, those would all be issues the UK would have to deal with too. As it is, the UK is far less focused on the continent and has an independent currency. Oh and the UK seems to have spent quite a lot of time reducing its exposure to southern EU risks too, so risk is lower",,/r/europe/comments/ap26g2/italys_populists_choose_provocation_over_politics/eg5taut/,-ah,1549815257

I would agree here, but this wasn't a deliberate process. it was just facilitated by societal progress.

as Romania started to modernize, we imported a lot of French words in areas such as culture, science, administration and city life. there was no way around it because we had a lot of catching up to do.

also due to centralization, provincial regionalisms fell out of favor to French neologisms used in urban areas. in fact, our national play writer (Ion Luca Caragiale) made fun of the mangled mix of French and Romanian spoken by the cosmopolitan *bourgeoisie*.

after this whole process, standard Romanian from urban areas diverged with the rural language quite a lot.

So, for example, the latest EU-Japan FTA doesn't apply directly to them. They also have a border with the EU, fyi.

3108,"[An estimation done by an independent journalist based on surface area (in Spanish)](https://twitter.com/matthewbennett/status/1094564197130739713?s=19)

According to the occupied area it has been around 100.000-150.000 people.

So first of all it is not a ""far right"" demonstration. Yes, some far right groups participated but the absolute majority supports the Constitution. 

This demonstration happened because many people were angered because of Sanchez's decision to cater to the independentist demands on how to negotiate by appointing an observer. This was shortly cancelled by the government shortly after due to how outrageous and completely devoid of any self-criticism the independentist demands were (basically making the Spanish Government say everything is fascist Spain's fault and the Catalan government has not done a single thing wrong).

We also have to add the animosity Catalan Independentism has generated in other regions. Due to these feeling insulted for the independentist's complete lack of empathy and respect towards them. From Catalan President Torra's racist remarks to the insulting comments towards other regions and their needs from many independentist personalities. 

This has all converged into the creation (with only one week in advance) of this demonstration. Which has nothing radical nor authoritarian despite having some less savoury groups tagging along. Another good thing that will come out from this is that VOX has showed again his anti-eu side criticising the decision of C's to bring EU flags with them to the demonstration. This in my opinion will weaken him as Spain is notoriously pro-EU.   

I hope this helps understanding the situation before some people try to sell this as some kind of skinhead riot.

Usually in presidential systems the president is not accountable to the parliamentary bodies because the president has not been selected by them. In EU the parliament can just decide to fire the commission if they feel like it, but in a presidential system this is much harder. The parliamentary bodies cannot fire the president if they feel like it and the people have to wait for years for new elections.

Wiosna has a hard ceiling at about 20%. Biedroń talks about winning the elections, I like his style, but it's not going to happen.

And there is little overlap between the 10-15% of voters who can support Biedroń, and the 20% of voters who remain with PO.

So - it's a win-win situation for these parties to work together.

&gt; PO litreally takes pride in doing changes slowly, meanwhile Wiosna wants fast change, so how would this be resolved ?

By PO doing changes they want to do slowly, and Wiosna doing changes they want to do - reasonably fast? I still think reality will catch up to them and in practice they will be like UW or early PO. Biedroń may use populist rethoric, but he's not going to introduce changes without all the due processes (consultations, normal voting in parliament and senate, corrections, vacatio legis, etc). This takes time.

Most importantly - the changes PO and Wiosna want to introduce are independent of each other. There's so much cleaning up after PIS to do, that the best PO can do is to let Wiosna work on social and LGBT matters while they fix all the institutions destroyed by PIS.

Coalitions between parties who are different are actually easier than coalitions between parties that are similar (because they don't compete for the same voters).

3282,"&gt; You are now generalizing as whole Croatia is like that 

No I'm not. I just said it's typical, as in it happens often. Way too often. Remember a few months ago when a car got vandalized with Ustashe signs because it had Belgrade licence plates? Dozens of incidents like this happen every year to Serbs in Croatia. The fact that Serbs need to conceal their Serbian accents (in fact anything that would give away the fact that they're Serbs) in order to avoid getting, at best only nasty looks, and at worst violence, tells me all I need to know about the attitude you hold against us.

The idea that this type of shit is spread beyond Split and hooligans is backed by the video. Hundreds of people passing by and not a soul helping him. One woman even justifies this because ""Well he's a chetnik after all, no?"". The idea that this is widespread across the entirety of your country is backed even by the simple fact that Thompson, the Ustashe sympathizer who sings of slaughtering Serbs is hailed as a national hero in your country. This mindset has spread to reddit as well. All it takes is one look at r/croatia. The majority of the comments on the post about this were justifying the violence because the Serbian waterpolo players were ""provoking them"" with their club jerseys.

Now tell me when was the last time something like this happened to a Croat in Serbia?

&gt;  incidents like that only happen in Split (where that one happened) and maybe Zadar, I'm not even sure about Zadar though.. 

Wrong like I said. You're either: a) Blind or b) Willfully ignorant.

&gt; 90% of Croatians would not approve that kind of behavior 

Wrong again. Also, I'd like the data and research for that statistic please.

&gt; One thing to note is that our news papers will send that message to Croatians and we will all be ashamed of what has happened there, while if similar thing would happen in Serbia, your news paper would not report that. This can be seen by 4000 people march for the weekends.. 

Yea, maybe [Index.hr](https://Index.hr), but the rest? Hell no. And yes, our news would definitely try to spin this as they're bought out by Vucic, with the exception of N1. But you know what the difference is? They wouldn't need to report on anything as this shit doesn't happen to Croats in Serbia. Unlike the other way around. Seriously, this hatred between the two nations is almost becoming one sided, and it ain't coming from out side.

When on Earth did you get that number? You should understand that Italy's carrier are far smaller than the American super-carriers and serve a variety of purposes. In fact, *Cavour* is clearly designed to support landing operations overseas:

&gt; The ship is designed to combine fixed wing V/STOL and helicopter air operations, command and control operations and the transport of military or civil personnel and heavy vehicles. The (...) hangar space can double as a **vehicle hold capable of holding up to 24 main battle tanks** (typically Ariete) or many more lighter vehicles (50 Dardo IFV, 100+ Iveco LMV), and is fitted aft with access ramps rated to 70 tons, as well as two elevators rated up to 30 tons for aircraft. **Cavour can also operate as landing platform helicopter, accommodating heavy transport helicopters (AgustaWestland UH-101A ASH) and 325 marines (91 more, on option).**

In other words, if Italy needs to intervene around the Mediterranean, this ship is designed to support such operations. That is far from unreasonable, given the condition North Africa and the Middle East are in.

Just because *you* don't see a reason for Italy to have such a ship doesn't mean that Italy doesn't need it. I am no naval expert (and I very much doubt you are either), but given my meagre understanding of military strategy, having such a ship is fairly justified given Italy's position in the Mediterranean Sea and the threats and challenges it faces there.

&gt; What exactly is going to change in the next thirty years that will make a carrier seem like a sensible investment?

Aside from the above explanation (devil's in the details, as usual), where do you draw this confidence about the future from? A lot can change in 30 years. I bet nobody predicted the collapse of Libya or the Arab Spring, very few people predicted that Russia would be openly invading and annexing territory of sovereign nations, or that Turkey would turn against the West under Erdogan. Basically anything can change and ANY RESPONSIBLE DEFENCE STRATEGY has to try and predict a wide range of potential challenges and prepare accordingly.

Italy has clearly determined that it might be asked to participate in operations around the Mediterranean, likely as part of broader NATO or EU missions, aimed at stabilising failed states, rescuing Italian or allied nationals, protecting Italian and European shipping from piracy, etc. etc. etc. Small carrier-landing vessels such as *Cavour* and *Garibaldi* are ideal tools for these missions.

Furthermore, with all due respect to Mr. Heusgen, Serbia's (admittedly dumb) fight to gain support for retracting independence recognition of Kosovo has nothing to do with Serbia's EU ascension. Kosovo has done plenty of lobbying and has fought for years in order to gain recognition, thus I don't see why Serbia couldn't engage in similar affairs, even if it's only for show. I'd wager it's just a fair diplomatic fight. Objectively, the retracted independence recognitions mostly came from tiny island countries, and I really see no reason why was there such an uproar about them.

3519,"&gt;Let me illustrate this with an example. Every year, we run thousands of experiments in Search. We recently ran one in the EU to understand the impact of the proposed Article 11 if we could show only URLs, very short fragments of headlines, and no preview images. All versions of the experiment resulted in substantial traffic loss to news publishers.  
&gt;  
&gt;Even a moderate version of the experiment (where we showed the publication title, URL, and video thumbnails) led to a 45 percent reduction in traffic to news publishers. Our experiment demonstrated that many users turned instead to non-news sites, social media platforms, and online video sites—another unintended consequence of legislation that aims to support high-quality journalism. Searches on Google even increased as users sought alternate ways to find information.

Sheesh, this malformed malpractice really has potential to screw things up in profound manner.

There's no credibility to the myth that Romanian is the closest to Latin. Although the language has kept some important traits of Latin, like the 3 genders and the 6 cases, the Slavic influences in our language are very clear, especially when it comes to vocabulary and pronunciation. From that point of view Italian and Spanish is closer to Latin.  
Also the fact that we're surrounded by other languages, and at various points in history dominated and conquered by them as well, has very much influenced our language.

3535,"Although I understand some of the motives that leads to people in France not being happy, the truth is that things in general are not so bad. For example, other countries in Europe like Portugal have lower purchasing power than France and you don't see them in the streets destroying property and creating more chaos that negatively affects the economy and in turn makes things even worse. I believe Portugal - for example - would be better suited for direct democracy than France.
France is a democratic country and has democratic tools in place (besides voting) to make our voice be heard. If people ignore or don't know these tools and instead go on the streets creating chaos, how can we expect them to care, be involved and use the tools in a direct democracy?

Heck, France has one of the best social securities. I'm currently traveling in the USA and it's eye opening the number of people with mental problems, drug addicts and homeless walking freely in the streets without any aid. Again, things are not so bad in France.

I believe France needs at least a few cycles of young generations going through civic duty education and be taught how to be involved in a democracy and use state institutions and tools for that end, before France can actually implement a direct democracy.

What *is* the UK asking for?

That's supposedly true with the Sámi also. I've read somewhere that they have South-West European origin genetically, and that they are presumed to have been a relatively small and isolated group of hunters that followed the retreating ice along the west coast.

...but their languages are the result of meeting another group of people somewhere up north, around the Kola peninsula or northern Finland, who spoke a proto-Finnish language.  
And for whatever reason they more or less abandoned their own language and instead adopted this Finnic language, which then split end evolved into the various Sámi languages and dialects... This in paralell with Finnish evolving its own way, as Finns and Sámis lived quite separately from each others, not interacting with each other ""more than absolutely necessary"".
  
Besides some similarities in some of the most basic (and old) vocabulary (and also the some similarities in the general *structure*) there is practically no mutual intelligibility.

3832,"&gt;&gt;Likewise what the goal of EU is is not completely set in stone.

&gt;That's the single biggest problem with the EU. Either it federalises (properly, fiscal union and all) or it continues to stumble along, with further economic divergence and more financial crises. 

So you admit that the ultimate goal of EU is not set in stone like you previously claimed.

&gt;It wasn't speculation on my part, I was referring to the goal that, most the committed europhiles, concede needs to be realised.

They don't get to decide the goal of EU. The change of EU happens via representative democracy, who we vote in national elections and EP elections.

&gt;Oh come on, don't be so obtuse. The Parliament and the Council (who are in many ways the same), and to a far lesser (but not insignificant) extent, the council. 

Tons of people talk about ""Brussels"" without even knowing how EU operates.

Parliament is directly elected by the EU citizens. Council represents the national governments elected by the people. As the opinions of people change, so do the views of the Parliament and the Council. So there is no set goal, unlike you claimed.

&gt;You assume that Europe is incapable of knocking down most barriers to free trade without the EU.

No, I don't assume. But in our current timeline, it is the EU who knocked down most barriers to free trade within Europe. Therefore it is silly to say EU is against free trade.

&gt;an EU-less Europe wouldn't be all that different on the trade front.

So in your view it would be as much against free trade as Europe is todeay? Then why blame EU for being against free trade?

&gt;It also doesn't change the fact that the EU's championing of proper free trade is confined to within her own borders, she looks at the rest of the world suspiciously.

And what's inside those borders? 28 member states, which before EU did not have a customs union or free trade.

Your argument is silly. Let's imagine an extremely pro free trade union. In the end it ends up encompassing 99% of the world, so 99% of the world is within that single market union. It would be silly to claim that an union encompassing most of the world in free market is against free market, because it doesn't have full free market with those outside the market. You are completely ignoring how large free market area EU has managed to create between nations. You treat EU as a single country, not as an organization which managed to create single market among dozens of countries. If EU were against free market, *there would not be European single market*.

And as for looking the rest of the world suspiously, EU still has a huge amount of FTA's.

&gt;Consequently, some individual member states could potentially achieve a better FTA with particular third countries if they were allowed to negotiate these themselves because they wouldn't be bound the the protectionist interests of the other 27.

""Could potentially"". So it's just uncertain speculation.

And again let's remind that EU has a large amount of FTA's and EU has much more negotiating power than individual countries, meaning EU can reach much more beneficial FTA's with other economies since it is far more interesting for other markets to get acces to entire EU market than just to a market of a single country.

And again your claims of protectionism are unfounded, since EU has pretty much abolished protectionism among its member states and created a large amount of FTA's.

If you think EU is agains free trade and EU is a protectionist market, could you name for example 10 markets in the world which are genuinely not protectionists and are supportive for free trade? And how many FTA's do those economies have? And how many countries it is that they have managed to remove customs and tariffs like EU has managed to remove between 28 countries?",Finland,/r/europe/comments/aos0me/brexit_250_uk_companies_discuss_moving_to/eg4i4fw/,Toby_Forrester,1549759104

The case of Venezuela is a paradigmatic example of how a truly common foreign policy of the European Union may be objectively contrary to the interests of some countries - in this case, of Portugal.

Not that, in this case, the European Union is not quite right. Venezuela has become a democratic anecdote, which only the indigenous extreme left can (without laughing) defend. Accepting that the Venezuelan regime, having lost the legislative elections, could then create a self-proclaimed Constituent Assembly to delegitimize the Legislative Assembly, would be to dynamite the whole concept of Democracy.

Portugal is, in this case, in a particularly delicate position. The Venezuelan regime has as human hostages some hundreds of thousands of Portuguese and Luso-descendants and has begun to make threats - in some cases, even in a veiled way, in other cases, already in a very audible way.

We have no doubts about what the majority of the community thinks about the Venezuelan regime. Many of the members of this community are merchants. Given the policy of the Venezuelan regime, which (almost) did everything to hinder private initiative, with the results now in sight of all, it is easy to guess what the great majority of the Portuguese and Portuguese-descendant communities think of it (or already returned) on the Venezuelan regime.

However, even this community will now be very hesitant to express its opposition to the regime, for reasons more than understandable. When our life is not at stake, it is (too) easy to make grand proclamations of principle. And so the Paris-Berlin Axis (the keystone of the self-proclaimed common foreign policy of the European Union) made its proclamation of principle - as we have said, but only understandable because, unlike Portugal, Germany and France have no real interests at stake.

Imagine, however, another scenario. Let us imagine that the social and political turbulence in Brazil leads to an authoritarian drift. Let us now imagine that, in view of this, the Franco-German axis would like to impose a position similar to the position it now takes vis-à-vis Venezuela. Should the Portuguese Government, whatever it may be, accept a cut of relations (even if by drag) with our largest brother country? In this case, our extreme left would certainly rejoice (since they have already argued that Portugal should not have been represented at the highest level in the inauguration of Jair Bolsonaro ...), but the answer can only be a resounding no.

3884,"&gt; Salafist Islam is just the icing on the cake.

That's something you don't read every day.

&gt; The mistreatment of women (domestic violence being considered a family matter for example) is not something that just krept up because suddenly the Saudis took an interest in the region. 

It certainly isn't helping, and you'd be naive to underestimate how much influence the Saudis can wield.

But thanks for your view on this, it is good to see the ""other side"". One of my main issues though is that it seems that islamic countries for the most part just won't soften when it comes to giving women an equal place in society.

For example, my country is still majority catholic but in the last 20 years alone we've decriminalised drug usage, legalised abortion &amp; gay marriage.

Would Kosovo do this in the next 20 years? If not then why not?

Just as a perspective: I don't think we will see gay marriage in Hungary either in the next 20 years. I'd be surprised if Poland did introduce it in that timespan. Germany only introduced full gay marriage last year and the way it was introduced was, lets say questionable and leads to a lot of legal and philosophical arguments. I'm not really that deep into politics in other countries in eastern and central Europe to make predictions for those countries however I wouldn't bet against another 2-3 EU member states not introducing it within said period of time. If you look at how the russian orthodox church looks at gay persons you also get an idea that the western view on this topic is not really one shared in many places of the world. Hell, even in the US that topic is very divisive. 

What I'm saying is and I'm not sure if that message gets through is more than just radical islam that creates conditions of living that are untenable for certain groups in a society. It doesn't help anybody, the least people trying to limit influence of those fanatics from the gulf if you argue without differentiating and looking properly at a problem. There are still plenty of reasons to fundamentally oppose salafism without the case mentioned in that news article and using this one as a leverage merely makes your case weaker, not stronger.

Since you are retarded and mention Morocco as a safe country: Dublin is an EU regulation. It forces the 1st EU country that an refugee arrived on to take them back and be the ones that process their asylum claim. Morocco or Turkey are not in the EU and they are not bound by the Dublin Agreement. Nor are individual refugees.

There is no mention about being a safe country (after all EU countries would be presumed to be safe). Also that myth is usually attached to the [1951 Geneva Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_Relating_to_the_Status_of_Refugees). Can't even do proper bullshit.

Anyways Merkel suspended it quite late, in August 2015 after we had have record numbers of arrival. It was a good move as it relieved pressure from **Greece and Italy**, European countries. 

Later on the EU practically bribed Turkey to keep refugees, maybe they should just unsuspend that 1990 agreement heh? 

Spain also has been paying Morocco to help contain the problem, they must be idiots not trying to get the EU to make Morocco honor it's 1990 protocol obligations.

Most of the attacks were done by citizens of those countries who grew up in those countries. A few of them went from Western Europe to the Middle East to fight for ISIS and came back. 

&gt;These are nearly all wealthy Iranians who are safe in France and want to come to Britain citing that Iran was not a nice place to live anymore for reasons such as no ‘dating’ before marriage, no alcohol etc.

What the fuck do people already in France going to the UK have to do with Merkel? Did she suspend the 1990 protocol for France and the UK too? 

And are you seriously arguing that anybody deserves to live in an Islamist theocracy where pre-marital relations are punishable by lashing and death penalty (on the 4th count)? Are you that stupid? Iran is a safe place that nobody has a reason to flee from? 

&gt;Again, you should go and look at statistics and papers written on this sort of thing before weighing in on something you don’t seem to have a grasp of. It is a waste of people’s time having to bring your knowledge up to speed, when you can do it yourself.

You must be a troll. You don't know even the most basic facts and speak like you gone through studies and papers. Fuck off kid, off with your lies and bullshit.

4039,"Also very strange how they use the symbols of soldiers for new troop placements.

The Russian symbol stands for a complete division where as the symbols for the NATO-deployments say nothing about the numbers. Sadly, I could not find the exact numbers but for example one of the NATO seem to be in the size of 500 - 1000 troops while a division is in the size of 10000 troops.

Also the color schemes are strange. Belarus and Ukraine are colored as if they belong to Russia and makes it look like the new divisions are stationed deep within the Russian territory. Both countries are independent nations so Russia is deploying divisions close to other countries.

I think the most important think to remember is the following: the fear is not that Russia might overrun Europe. However, the Baltic states are in a vulnerable position and if Russia would invade them they could not defend themselves. Then NATO would have to attack there to reconquer them.

...Okay well I've moved here 3 years ago and honestly the services are NOWHERE NEAR that bad. Some may be more expensive than other countries (telecoms specifically) but once you take into account how much we tend to earn... yeah.

&gt;most people are about as rude as it can get without resorting to physical violence

First of all, speak Dutch and already that becomes a non-issue, because Dutch is far more direct than English and tonnes of Dutch people just speak English as they would Dutch because that's just their speaking patter.

Second of all, I seriously have never met more rude people here than I have in Portugal or France or even Taiwan or Australia.

&gt;Racism and the racially segregated society

I am not fully white, and although I agree that racial segregation is an issue, this tends to only be an issue in Amsterdam, which ironically you said is the only good place here (yes sure let's ignore Eindhoven, Utrecht, Nijmegen, the Hague, etc...).

Racism is still an issue, I agree, but even so, I've met way less racist attitudes in NL than in other European countries.

&gt;The cuisine (or lack thereof)

Who the fuck forbade you from just cooking and eating whatever you'd like? It's what Dutch people do: look up recipes and cook them to try stuff from around the world.

&gt;outside of Amsterdam it's as boring as it gets

So essentially, you've been a sheltered tourist during your stay here. Amsterdam is kinda known as the worst part of the Randstad, it gets quite a bit of criticism from all around the Netherlands for just essentially being a tourist-fest Disneyland version of the Netherlands.

Go somewhere else and learn about the country.

4113,"&gt; services are NOWHERE NEAR that bad. Some may be more expensive [...] how much we tend to earn...

I'm sorry dude, but having moved here from Canada maybe I have to disagree with you on both the services and the ""how much we earn"" part. As far as public services go the bureaucracy is through the roof here, and don't even get me started with the private services where everybody tries to scam you as soon as they get the chance. If they screw up however, it's no big deal, most of the time they won't even apologize.  

&gt; First of all, speak Dutch and already that becomes a non-issue

My Dutch is pretty good and is part of the reason I came here. It's also the thing that brought me the most misery, thinking that I could use it to my advantage and I ended up working in a Dutch company with Dutch people. Worst months of my life, period. I've since moved to an international company and the difference is almost surreal.

&gt; Who the fuck forbade you from just cooking and eating whatever you'd like.

It's what I'm doing. No way would I eat the garbage that passes as food around here.

4200,"&gt;That's a recurrent theme we hear from the British isles. Don't they understand how arrogant this is? Don't they understand that the Norwegians, Dutch, Lithuanians don't see why they should have less rights than the British because their countries are smaller? Isn't the protection of the rights and borders of small EU members against the imperialist instincts of the big animals a fundamental achievement of the EU? Why would the plurality of small countries of the EU27 throw this overboard just to pamper the Brits?

The UK is leaving the EU though, and the context here is important. The UK will of course apply EU rules to business with the EU, in the same way that it will when it trades with the US, China or anyone else. The quote you are pulling from the article though is that it is a fundamental red line for Brussels that the UK makes its own rules for its own internal market...  

In that context London is absolutely right to challenge the EU. The UK is leaving the EU, it is going to regulate its own internal market, it is not going to hand off that autonomy for a trade deal, it simply isn't worth it (the UK internal market is massively larger than it's international trade after all). 

this isn't about arrogance, it isn't about having more or less rights, the Norwegians, Dutch and Lithuanians have decided to exchange sovereignty and control over their markets in exchange for being part of a large block, the UK is leaving that block, as a result it is 'taking back control' of its market.

Maybe you could explain why on earth the UK should accept anything short of regulatory autonomy when it is outside of the EU and aiming for an FTA?

At this point, UK-Europe should be like siblings who grew up after an era of usual sibling rivalry phase.

Britain has been central balance to this dynamic all through history and now for some ""reason"" they threw that away.

Coming from Asia, where there were central authorities already well established, or kingdoms which had more or less accepted territorial demarcations with a rigid governing system, all we had was a gradual decline from every ""golden age"". The urgency to innovate, to find a system of governance versatile enough to be accepted by all, was never there.

Indian empires never took the next step, or never had the opportunities, to create a more flexible, secular, robust administration like what HRE became (even its bureaucracy was its advantage).

4257,"That part about Romanian being the closest to latin is mostly an urban myth and it starts to get more and more popular.  
From wiki:  

&gt; One study analyzing the degree of differentiation of Romance languages in comparison to Latin (comparing phonology, inflection, discourse, syntax, vocabulary, and intonation) indicated the following percentages (the higher the percentage, the greater the distance from Latin):   
Sardinian 8%,   
Italian 12%,   
Spanish 20%,   
Romanian 23.5%,   
Occitan 25%,   
Portuguese 31%,   
French 44%.  

We're pretty much somewhere in between when it comes to how ""close"" we could be to Latin.  

&gt; Btw, language is a different thing from ethnicity. I have no idea whether it's right to say that Romanians are latin slavs  

Yeah, that's mostly meme material, I believe. All kinds of ethnicity have washed over the present-day Romania, at this point us being ""slavic"" or ""latin"" its not so much about genes as it is about identity and most often than not Romanians tend to identify as having ""latin"" roots.  

[We have a lot of shit going on, but Latin and French have priority and they're followed by slavic and italian influences, and a a mix of bulgarian, german, greek, hungarian, rusian, dacian, serbian-croatian, ukrainian](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/03/CuvinteleLimbiiRomane.svg)",Romania,/r/europe/comments/aos2oc/why_you_are_you_like_that/eg3gua8/,ceproastaimata,1549729680

4391,"Relevant ""news"" from the fake news magazine [postillon](https://www.der-postillon.com/2019/01/queen-brexit.html) (translated with deepl):

&gt; London (dpo) - Enough is enough! In view of the chaotic conditions in British politics in the run-up to the Brexit, Queen Elizabeth II has spoken a word of power today: As the 92-year-old announced in a TV speech, the parliamentary monarchy will be transformed back into an absolute monarchy with immediate effect.

&gt; ""I've watched this ridiculous democracy circus long enough now and I'm not amused,"" said the visibly angry Queen in her speech to her subjects. &gt; ""Useless spontaneous elections, unstable majorities, rumbling eggs on the Brexit course, failed votes, motions of no confidence, Boris Johnson... Enough!
&gt; In the future, therefore, the Queen's sure hand will again determine all political issues - Parliament will thus be completely deprived of its power. The previous Prime Minister Theresa May as well as numerous other politicians and ministers were thrown into the dungeon by members of the Queen's Guard.

&gt; The restoration of the absolute monarchy is legally secured by an additional article of the Magna Carta. The corresponding passage says: ""(...) if þe Pryme Ministre fucketh uppe majorly, þe Kynge or Qween shall regaine thereupon His or Her powre and rule as in olde tymes (...)"".
The inaugural speech of the newly-made autocrat revealed numerous innovations in the political orientation of the United Kingdom: Thus it is supposed to be the new main goal of the Brexit negotiations to regain the territories lost to arch-enemy France in the Hundred Years' War between 1337 and 1453 - if necessary also by force of arms.
&gt; Also the former colony USA is to return as fast as possible into the lap of the monarchy. According to insiders, negotiations with several advisers of US President Trump, who should not be reluctant, are already in progress to reintegrate the United States to the British Kingdom in return for the title ""Viceroy of America"", a golden crown together with sceptre as well as a magnificent parade through London.

There are other reasons why a person might be undesirable for a job that are not related to health. Even though there are laws against it, pregnant women, mothers, people with tattoos and piercings, convicted criminals and certain ethnic groups are discriminated against. Saying that these people, who clearly struggle, are lazy or socially inept, is unjust. To see the world black and white (disabled and normal) doesn't work. There are many justified reasons why a person can struggle finding a job and earning money and I haven't even mentioned the effects of automation on the job market. 

A BUI doesn't provide luxuries. It is the least amount of money necessary for a person to pay the bills and not die. If a person wants something nice, they will still have to work for it.

4460,"What he didn't take seriously was religious dogma enforced by a State or a Church operating as a State (as was common at the time). I think Jesus' most important political message was that this had corrupted the Jewish faith. It seems Jesus made these kinds of statements almost brutally obvious, when you think about how he interacted with the State even up to his death. What is also politically significant on Jesus' part is is his support for the Romans despite his disciples and many of the people around him basically begging him to become a sort of religious king and start an insurrection against the Romans. He even made clear that his version of Judaism would no longer be associated with a State, as he implored people to accept Gentiles and preach outside the bounds of Judea and to the Greco-Roman world as a whole.

&amp;#x200B;

I think the healthiest interpretation of Christianity is to accept that the Bible is not without errors (and that errors of misinterpreting Jesus' words to mean whatever you want them to mean was common in the early church). There is a strong argument to be made (even based on Biblical principles) that Jesus advocates primarily for a society based on civic virtue and respect for people in different situations and who have different values (even those of a prostitute or a pagan society like the romans that didn't really have the same concept of religious dogma that the Jews had.) This interpretation is most quickly justified by noting that Jesus did not hold all Jewish religious works equally in their validity. In the same way Jesus did this, Christians should  apply the same analysis to the works of early church writers and philosophers and preachers. Get rid of the stuff that Jesus never weighed in on, but especially get rid of the parts of the New Testament that directly contradict things that Jesus said.",,/r/europe/comments/an506t/nearly_half_of_french_and_germans_think_islam/eg326p6/,Retwakm,1549714966

4505,"I guess it's similar to France's way of doing things. Our doctrine is that we should be able to fight by ourselves, so our planes can't depend on owning the sky and having all the air defense destroyed first (whereas it's the basis for most modern American planes, but also for the euro fighter).

As a result the rafale has its own dedicated electronic warfare unit, and the claim was that they could pretty much ignore the s200 system. Of course Russia said nope, and the potential customers didn't exactly believe it. Then Libya happens, French is making strikes hours before the US cleans up the air defense, and the second best air defense system in Africa after Egypt, based on s200 system, can't do anything to stop the rafales for hours.

Latest revision of the rafale, on top of its aesa radar and stuff, include significant upgrade to its ew unit, and unofficially it could go against s300 now. Of course Russia calls bullshit. But when we hit Syria after the gas attack, they (the Russian with their s300 deployed at their base in country) were all happy to claim ""US? Yes. UK? Yed. But there was no French planes"" until the French ministry of defense published its video of the strike ""uhh, yeah we were here, you just couldn't even see us lol"".

If you're part of a US battle group, such an electronic warfare can seem like a waste. Only reason we have it is so we can go on our own if need be. But for a country like Sweden whose defense against Russia is guerilla fighting using forest road and shit, this is a major thing.

Thanks, that's some interesting data, especially the fact that services normally create most added value, while construction and finance has the least. The retail sales are grouped together and have a quite a big added value, however I'm not sure a cashier is a vital chain in this process. The reason being automation, automatic cash registers are now ubiquitous and will only increase in prevalence, especially with fully automated stores. In my opinion this shows that a cashier's job is not creating a lot of added value, since it can be automated cheaply and effectively. On the other hand, even in this low added value field of construction, it is much harder to automate a roofer, or even a simple brick layer.  


Anyway, thanks for the interesting discussion.

4851,"&gt; And what happened next? That all the right-wing and Spanish nationalist parties began to attack the president, accusing him of being traitor and enemy of Spain, announcing a demonstration next Sunday to dethrone him. All because he had agreed to dialogue with the Catalan pro-independence government, using a neutral mediator.

I'm not understanding what you're saying to be fair.  They couldn't pull a vote of no confidence since they don't have the support to do so. How are the accusations from the right any different than what they've been saying? They've been calling him a planted separatist mole/traitor from the beginning.  Demonstrations against the PSOE government during the negotiations with ETA from the right were also common, but the government endured because people wanted those negotiations to go through. The latests CIS data shows that most people in Spain want dialogue from the government while only something like 17% want a hard hand to be applied to Catalonia. Most of the respondents who want that extreme option are already positioned to vote for PP/Vox/Cs. 

It's also worth noting that in addition to the rally this weekend in Madrid from the right, the separatist also have rallies planned in Barcelona and Madrid. Either way, the central government has someone on them right now. I don't think it matters at this point now since elections are probably going to happen now. 

&gt; Specially that ""pardoning the separatist leaders on trial in exchange for budget approval"" part, which never happened.

And so are British born and raised British Asians, if you build an empire,raise people in your culture and language, and then bring them to your capital by invitation from the king, and then those people have kids in England and raise them here, then yeah they're British, even if their complexion isn't the same as the celts, angles and saxons, normans and vikings that came here in the centuries before that.

Back then US's major concern was to cut its military spending while maintaining dominance over lesser opponents, which was everyone including Russia. Hence, F-35 was designed to excel at all kind of asymmetric warfares and be the be-all-end-all solution for the US air force. This comes at the expense of F-35 literally sucks in any kind of symmetric warfare (of which J-20 offers). Even that was actually an advantage, as it meant US could freely sell F-35 to really any country without little fear that it would be turned against itself, as US could have countered them easily with F-22.

Then J-20 came out of nowhere and made this plan this difficult. J-20 is nowhere nearly as advanced as F-35 but it forces F-35 to play the symmetric game F-35 hates, while countries like Japan would not want to buy this expensive plane any more knowing it would not be useful against their main rival.

When May said that No-Deal is better than a bad Deal, she was correct, just that it's not the UK but the EU.

The UK will come around to some deal of some sort with time anyway (even if that happens years after the UK left the EU), proximity is the primary factor when looking at trade worldwide, the UK cannot replace the EU as a trade partner. 

Even the German car companies, that are bound to lose a large market in a No-Deal scenario, prefer that the single market stays intact. It can only stay intact, if there is a good reason to have it. That includes protecting Ireland.

And towards this all, the backstop is not really the problem. The main problem is that the UK government has no majority for anything. Deal, No Deal or Remain. It doesn't know what it wants.

Regardless, Delong &amp; Summers (2012) have demonstrated how the costs of austerity are much higher than their benefits. The Eurozone is the only place where politicians, who were hearing voices in their heads, chose to implement austerity measures *during a crisis* and shown in Ball, Laurence (2014) “Long-term damage from the Great Recession in OECD countries” the Eurozone fell off to a lower steady state.

The US went down the austerity route during the first few years of the Great Depression too. It failed miserably and just accelerated the crisis just like it did in Greece.

I'm not saying there's an easy solution as I understand the politics of the Eurozone is complicated, but I am confident enough to say that the German austerity model was a huge failure. It'd be smarter to admit it and try to fix it than double down on something that is clearly not working. It's apparent to the rest of the World or any other economic bloc would have copied it.

There are many other ways to deleverage the debt: 1). austerity 2). raise taxes 3). restructure the debt 4). devalue the currency. I understand that it's not as simple for devaluing the Euro or restructuring the debt, but that doesn't mean that those wouldn't have worked for Greece. Mixing all 4 would have been a far less harsh landing and likely would have led to growth by now.

Even if inflation wasn't an option, Germany and others would/will get more of their money back if they allowed Greece to have a more sustainable payment schedule/load than they will on the current path.

1. The pool of eligible candidates was selected from people already receiving a long term aid which means that most of them **were already long time unemployed. These are people who are hard to employ under any conditions. 
2. Since all the candidates were already unemployed the trial does not allow for a person to quit their job. Meaning that a higher level of unemployment was not a possibility under the parameters of the test. 
3. Duration of the trial. Since it was a trial with a set end date, we did not see people making the types of lasting change that an open ended trial could have allowed. 

Considering these factors it isn't perhaps a great surprise that the result showed no change in unemployment.

* Here I can use very comfortably contactless payment when there they used rather cash (they brought machine out somewhere when I wanted to pay with card) and also now many client cards contactless
* E-applications, E-signature, E-receipts, E-information - when I want to have some drug prescription from my GP and I am user of it already then usually I send just an e-mail (for example in the middle of the night) and next morning I go to apothecary and give my Id-card and I get it. If I go to doctor then after visit I can log in my ""digital (medical) story"" page and read over again what we spoke in the visit, drugs prescriptions, diagnosis, fit notes, test results etc. If I want to check if my sick leave is on or any other information about my health, property, family or change information in some institutions (for example if I move) I can do it easily by logging in general Estonian page eesti.ee. 
* I use banks' apps in my phone where I can easily see if some amount of money goes from my bank account, pay bills and make transactions within 1 minute. I always know how much money I have on my bank account and use rarely ATMs.
* All school applications, project contracts and such kind of stuff I can do with E-signature. Only if having projects with other countries I have had to use regular on-paper signature. 
* When I went to school I got to see my homework, grades and projects in E-school. Results of bigger exams came with sms (it was about 10 years ago)
* When I go to city bus and I have 2 euros on my bus card and I validate it and buy ticket but after that I decide that it is better to buy monthly-ticket and I will drive once again with bus on that day and validate again I get my money back automatically on the card and instead system uses this new monthly ticket now for the last ride, too.
* Elections, taxes and this kind of information comes to e-mail and I can participate elections online, same with taxes. It takes for me about 2-10 minutes.
* I watch TV when I want and what I want - just saving my tv-shows I want and watching them later when it is suitable for me. TV also offers some free movies when I don't find what to watch and of course I can watch my Netflix from TV.
* I can order ID-card online.


When I was on this other EU country they used checks to get my project payments from bank that was open until 14 PM but they gave your money out only until 12 at noon on workdays, no e-signatures etc.

Maybe we should mandate everyone carry a camera on them 24/7 so we can know when people are committing copyright infringement?

If you make copies of copyrighted content and spread that to millions upon millions of people, you can be sure you will get in trouble.

5398,"&gt;Average rent for a one bedroom is 1700 a month.

That's the problem: people can absolutely not imagine not living intramuros where, yes, you might get studio apartments for &gt;1000 € a month. Move 20 minutes by RER away from Châtelet, and you're dealing with sub-thousand prices for decent apartments, not even in ghettoes. The increase in price for transport is absolutely negligible (\~ 50 € a month with a yearly pass, and half of that is paid for by your employer by law). Out of the 12 million people living in the Paris region, \~80 % do not live in the city of Paris. A suburban house (kills the environment btw but let's put that aside) with a garden and all can get relatively cheap, in the realm of 300 or 400k, and with still a decent transport coverage (&lt; 10 minutes away from a RER station). If you don't have a family, you can get pretty okay apartments for as little as 800 € a month. Just not in Paris.

BTW, the 1700 € for a one bedroom is absolutely a stretch. Prices in the XXe or XIXe are much lower.

&gt;You can see why the most eager supporters of Brexit are such  fans of the WTO, because one of their main complaints about the EU is  it’s “unaccountable and undemocratic”. There’s a lot of truth in this,  whereas the WTO is so democratic it’s a nuisance.  
&gt;  
&gt;Unlike the aloof EU, they’re run by a General Council,  meaning all the ordinary citizen has to do to get their voice heard is  get themselves on the General Council somehow, and no one seems to be  sure how anyone does that, making the WTO only slightly less open and  democratic than Fifa and the Vatican.  
&gt;  
&gt;They’re an approachable bunch, with a meeting once every  two years, and all you have to do if you want to pop into their  summit is get past a line of tanks and armed guards and water cannon,  and offer any opinion you want from the comfort of your own cell.

5448,"&gt; And as far as I can understand there is also no scientific consensus on this topic. 

No there really isn't. However you have to look at what scientists tells you what. Scientist usually means having a lot of knowledge in one specific area. 

The problem with renewables is simply cost and the definition of the word renewables. Nuclear power is in a way renewable. Sure we are slowly burning away the fuel. However its not like we are going to run out of it in the next million years. Solar power is using the power of the sun which again is a nuclear reactor (fusion not fission). But this is a part of definition. 

Waterpower is also a renewable power that is very effective in huge dams. However those are very limited as they need a special landscape so we cannot really scale that up. 

This leaves us Solar and Wind and this is where the problem starts. 

Solar cells aren't that environmentally friendly to produce and they are a pain to recycle, so no one does that. So if we recycle our solar cells they are a lot better for the environment as they are right now, however they become extremely expensive. 

This brings us to the main problem. How much does it cost to build, and maintain disassemble/renew those Systems. How long are they operational and how much electricity will they produce in that time. Calculating from that. How cheap can you produce electricity? Now what about the time where the sun doesn't shine (strong enough) or what if there isn't enough or too much wind. Well you obviously have to store excess energy in some form of battery. How are those batteries produced (we certainly don't have enough lithium for that) and how much does it cost, whats the lifespan, etc. How big is the loss in storing the energy? For ease of calculation assume every energy production system has to take care of its own storage system. How much will that increase the cost of electricity?

The point is neither wind nor solar can produce energy for a reasonable price. At the end of the day, nearly all production needs electricity, specially when we think ahead to more automatization and digitalization. So when the electricity prices rise, the cost for basic products as well as the living cost will increase.

Its impossible to show a detailed calculation for his promises, since some are simply unrealistic and vague.

Thats delusional, about 80% of our energy is from coal and our energy consumption is increasing. Listening to Standerski, it seems they are just wishing for some huge technological breakthrough that will magically allow this to happen.

Anyway, Biedron claims his program will cost 35 billion. That estimate has already been shot down by people from all sides, its a fairytale.

&gt; For comparison 500+ costs about 25 billions yearly.

And Biedron wants to expand 500+, but thats totally not populism, right? No one has made as many populist promises as him. Cleanest air! Retirement for everyone!

Not really. 

The reason the Tories don't want a second referendum is because it fails to really solve the issues they have (it's quite likely it'd go leave again), takes a lot of time (think a year) so drags out the current uncertainty and political mess and most importantly, there is no winning outcome for the Tories. If it goes leave it puts them right back in the same place, but now with more political fallout, a loss of trust among those who voted the first time and so on, if the outcome is remain, the ignite another massive internal row about the EU and potentially cause themselves a major electoral issue.

People simply don't want to sacrifice their living standards. This whole ""climate change is going to ruin our planet"" talk is bullshit. Even if we get the worse case scenario and we just make it worse, the planet will recover. Sure hundreds of species will go extinct. But live will prevail. However its not like we are on the route to the worst case situation. Far from it. Many people are doing a lot trying to stop and to understand this climate change. 

I am in no way advocating that there is no climate change and that we should ignore it. I'm just advocating for reasonable solutions. In case of Electricity this would be some sort of atomic power. Synth-Fuel for Aircraft and Ships (this could easily be enforced by 2025). Hydrogen for Trucks and Buses and everything bigger than a Car. 

Switching Cars to electric will take the longest, however they are not the worst pollutant so this is acceptable for now.

I also know that hydrogen is produced with Methane right now. Creating a big hydrogen market and slowly escalating methane taxes will create a market for alternative systems to be developed that will eventually solve this problem as well.

Whatever, I don't really care if it's legal or not legal under the current rules. I care about what choices Germany makes. And from this perspective, it's pretty clear - Germany is a building a project that will harm Ukraine and potentionally other CEE countries too.

What is the legal situation around it is not the most important thing. Germany could choose to not build it even if it was legal. Germany could choose to create new rules to put it under more scrutiny, but it chooses not to. In fact it's doing what it can to push the project through, despite the objections of many other member states and then has the nerves to speak about 'European interest' and 'European security needs'.

5535,"&gt;They are designed to carry medium range anti air missiles, which is exactly what the plane is build for. Not really a disadvantage, it is a dedicated fighter aircraft.

It is a disadvantage because basically every fighter jet it competes with is better at ground attack, and there's not enough money or pilots to have a top-tier fighter and a great ground attack plane at the same time. The only plane worse at ground strike is the Raptor, and that not by far (it has four underwing pylons with 5000lbs capacity each). Meanwhile you got the Eagle and the Strike Eagle, F-16, Rafale and Flankers. All of which are great fighters and also far better bomb-trucks than the Eurofighter.

Well, the F-16 is not so much a great fighter as it is the best you can buy for the money. Which is also what the F-35 is aiming at (high end US fighters are always twinjets).

The worst part is that curret presidents of constitutional court back then literally called PM back then Donald Tusk to ask what would be consequences on polish economy if it was deemed unconstitutional, I shouldnt have to point out how bad it is, since PM Donald Tusk was from that political party that did the transfer of funds. It would be like judge called guilty guy to ask what would be consequences on his family if he was send to jail and decided verdict based on that.

Constitutional court shouldnt care if something can be a risk to polish economy, it should only care if something breaks constitution, at that moment Constitutional court played politics.

No, it wouldn't be. The UK and Ireland would be cooperating on border management, not creating new rules on trade or customs, it wouldn't change the tariffs applied, the regulations on either side or anything else. I'd be like a lot of the non-EU cross border cooperation that is already in place (say on visas..),.

Both Germany and France heavily discriminate against non-German and non-French speaking academics. There is no hope of a career there unless you speak the language fluently and even then they'll likely pick natives over foreigners. Suing won't do you any good since the promotion process is fundamentally subjective and you'll have a hard time proving discrimination in court.

In the Nordics and the Benelux there is very little, if any, discrimination of foreigners, and in fact in many places foreigners have an advantage due to explicit internationalization strategies of many universities. There are plenty of Chinese professors, for example.

The reality, however, is that in today's academia the chances of getting a professorship are basically zero. There are far more PhDs graduating than there are positions for professors. Only the best students of the best connect professors get tenure track positions.

5614,"1. The withdrawal period is limited to two years. It could be prolonged for a significant reason, yes, but you can surely understand that everyone in the EU has an legitimate interest in keeping this state of limbo as short as possible (which was the EU's stance from the beginning). If the UK wanted to have more time, they could have triggered Article 50 at a later date. But there's another thing: I really don't want do seem rude, but do you think that the current UK government would have been able to successfully negotiate both the withdrawal agreement and a trade deal at the same time, looking at how unorganised the British delegation was for the better half of the negotiations? And looking at the imbalance in sheer negotiating manpower between the UK and the EU, I think negotiating one after another is actually beneficiary for the UK.

2. Exactly my point.

3. I'm sorry, but it was entirely clear from the very beginning that you can either be completely in control but outside the single market, or be inside the single market but accept the rules of the EU. It was entirely clear that you can only co-create those rules as a member of the EU, and undermining this principle now would go against the very idea of the EU. And clear as it was, it's the UK that brought itself onto the horns of that dilemma between single market and GFA, and blaming the EU for it is just cheap.

4. It's not about who's in power now, it's about who might be soon. And it's also about the percieved popular opinion and who is the loudest, putting pressure on the government. UK politics is such a mess at the moment, you really cannot blame anyone in the EU to demand a bit more than just the word of a government that might not be in power anymore in half a year (or that of any government that consists of people like Boris Johnson, for that matter)",A Europe of Regions,/r/europe/comments/ao30az/where_europe_would_be_hurt_most_by_a_nodeal/eg0hdwj/,Sm_rrebr_d,1549627719

Now Kocner everyone knew for a long time. Slimy bastard that plays his games and has shit on everyone. Also good friend of former general prosecutor and his specialty is doing media hits on people he doesn't like. He knew everyone, everyone knew him, you know the type.

But the slimy bastard never seemed like the type who would have balls for murder. So question is if someone paid him, and if so who (several suspects), or if he went apeshit.

However after police raided his house and broke down his safe they found lot of shit. Among them were apparently preparations for murder of Daniel Lipsis, ex-minister and someone Kocner hates, and also deputy general prosecutor which is fish that is above anyone and unlikely that the slime ever would have balls to go that far. His contact in the murder between him and hitmen also is now being prosecutor for order of murder of ex-mayor of one small town. The bitch is now probably in safest place, prison, and she will be there for the rest of her life. The plan for Kuciak murder was originally to abduct him, kill him somewhere outside and then make him disappear so it would all appear as if he just ""went missing"". Lot of people do. But hitman fucked up, got to house and found his fiancee there who he killed. Kuciak came few minutes later and he shot him and ran in getaway car. So everything got out.

There are no ""intense studies"". Any attempts to discuss the topic leads to immediate attack from the state. Even Pocius almost ended up in prison for admitting that number of murdered was above zero.

&gt; Also the number of people involved with nazis was minimal ... a few high ranking officers. Most members could be described as having a nationalist attitude but definitely not nazis.

Do you have *anything* to support this? Because there are internal documents (i.e. not propaganda) of NKVD, and collaboration with Nazis (and/or participation in mass-murders) is a pretty consistent trend there. Soviets were certain that it was primarily criminals and draft dodgers.

Yes, and I don't think they're protesting either.

&gt; I really fear that ecological measures will vastly increase the gap in quality of life between rich and poor, because basic things like car transports, flights, utilities, independent living will become so expensive people have to ration and cut while the wealthy can continue to live the way they always have, just at (for them) slightly higher costs.

This is true, but also a balance to strike. For example, we could make food cheaper for them by removing food safety requirements. That'd be ridiculous to seriously suggest now, but if we didn't have food safety regulations already, you might argue that they shouldn't be introduced because they would increase the gap in quality of life between the rich and the poor.

Climate change is very likely to going to increase the gap between the rich and the poor a lot as well, albeit somewhat further down the future. So something needs to be done; we should be careful not to offload these costs to the poorest or even much of the middle class. Primarily, I would believe it lies in providing the industry with incentives to transition to climate-friendly alternatives. For example, if, in a hypothetical future, all cars are electric, they are likely to be no less affordable than current cars that run on fossil fuels.

5887,"&gt; The EU is capable of simply saying ""no deal, period"". If she wants no deal, how does she gain by pretending to want a deal?

That would put the blame on everything that will happen on solely on the shoulders of European political leaders and remove all blame from British politicians. The one constant in politics is to dodge the blame on everything bad happening and this one is predicted to be bad. By allowing the talks to go ahead with impossible to meet conditions, all the blame can be put on Britain in the eyes of the public.

As to the actual impossibility of making exceptions, it happens all the time when people want it to happen. The EU is under no obligation to make one, but they could have. The reason they won't entertain one is, because they want to either stop Brexit or punish Britain for Brexit and prevent other member states from leaving. With populism and Euro-critical parties rising in Europe there was a real risk of Brexit being just the first domino. If leaving was easy and relations continued smoothly, the threshold to leaving would be lowered. It was therefore vital to the EU's short term survival to prevent a smooth exit. It might not be smart long term, since no deal hurts Europe too and Britain might hold a grudge. There also needs to be changes within EU, since the short term lesson of Brexit will be forgotten, especially if Britain manages to turn things around and grow their economy faster than EU in the long term.",,/r/europe/comments/aoabu4/the_uk_doesnt_have_good_faith_they_are_aiming_for/eg04267/,DoubleSteve,1549606485

In not a single Western country is there punishment by the state for apostasy from any religion.

There are no laws against apostasy, and in fact there are organisations specialising in helping people who have been shunned by their religious communities (anti-cult organisations etc.) 

Apostasy is forbidden in all Abrahamic religions, sure, but there is only one religion that actually enforces this by action by the state in the forms of laws and punishmens. In fact, as you say, these countries consider apostasy to be treason, so much are they opposed to the Western values of freedom of religion and expression. 

Some philosophers may have suggested punishments for apostasy. But these ideas are not practiced in Western countries, because there are other philosophers who advocated for freedom of religion and expression and they were more influential. 

My distaste for Islam is not due to ignorance. You said yourself that most Islamic countries are so strongly against freedom of religion that they consider it treason.
