113,"For whatever reason, people in Greece have concentrated in Athens. 40% of the Greek population is now Athenian. To give perspective, while Greece is a small country in population, Athens is one of the biggest cities in Europe. Imagine if Berlin had 35mil inhabitants.

The extreme difference in population density has brought about changes in the people's mentality. Also, having 40% of the people in the same city has justified investing a lot in Athenian infrastructure.

As a side effect, this has birthed a vicious cycle that segregates Greeks. Some people in Athens think that non-Athenians are backwards, and some non-Athenians think that Athenians are smug, arrogant and self centred.

It is common for people in Athens to call people from the countryside Vlachoi (roughly transelates to rednecks). Driving in the countryside of Greece with an Athenian licence plate makes it more likely for you to get a speeding ticket for example as well.

- The government subsidized the cultivation of Eucalyptus trees in the area without any regard for fire safety. Eucalyptus trees tend to be really dry and burn stronger and easier than other trees. With large areas covered with those farms the fire could spread faster than many people could react.

- There are emergency plans for these incidents that have to be updated every 2 years. The government didn't do it claiming ""it wasn't necessary"". Combined with a understaffed firefighter force the first responses were badly coordinated and rather ineffective. Thus many residents complained that they haven't seen a single firefighter for hours while the fires raged trough their neighbourhoods.

- The residents haven't been alarmed in time since many communication and power lines were destroyed by the fire. The firefighter forces were not able to warn them in time and didn't lock down dangerous roads. Mostly because there was a huge confusion among themselfs. Also there was a severe lack of water since many of the pipes in the area got destroyed.

2. Stupid trend is also a thing: there was a case in Southern Kyrgyzstan, when one hooligan was shouting ""Allah Akbar"" during robbing just because he considered it to be cool.

3. But, there is foreign influence. Some sponsors from foreign countries(mainly Arabic countries) fund building of mosques. Now there are too many mosques and not enough people to fill them. 

4. Now, there is a story with Kyrgyz-Turkish schools. Some organization, ""Sebat"", which according to rumors, is related to Fetullah Gulen(religious leader and arch-enemy of Erdogan), built a network of schools in Kyrgyzstan.

In the 1970s Boeing was the be-all and end-all in aviation and Airbus was an audacious European project that many said was crazy and doomed to fail. Boeing just seemed too big, too advanced and too dominant to be challenged. (Their dominance had already killed or swallowed up nearly all the post-WW2 aircraft companies.)

Luckily some boring dull European economists analysed the situation and said that a European passenger jet made long term economic sense.

Moreover, people said that the Airbus was a recipe for disaster because the idea was that it was going to be a collaborative project between countries - and that would mean that it was doomed to failure. People used the argument that ""the camel is a horse designed by a committee"".

Despite the challenges and skepticism, Airbus succeeded and has resulted in trillions of Euros worth of revenue staying in the EU. 

Boeing is still an amazing company but the existence of Airbus is the sort of history lesson that us Brits should think long and hard about when contemplating our Brexit future.

383,"A youth revolt is upending Italian politics, and it could be a harbinger of things to come.

Western Europe’s largest antiestablishment government came to power earlier this month, driven largely by young Italian voters. Struggling with a persistent lack of job prospects over the past decade, they voted in droves for two parties in the country’s March 4 elections, the 5 Star Movement and the League, an anti-immigration party.

The result laid bare a stark generation gap, with older Italians, who often have to support their grown children, continuing to vote for mainstream parties.

The same pattern appears across southern Europe, and the forces behind the divide show few signs of slowing. Almost 30&amp;#37; of Italians age 20 to 34 aren’t working, studying or in a training program, according to Eurostat, more than in any other European Union country.

385,"“Italy is collapsing and yet nothing has changed in this country for at least 30 years,” said Carlo Gaetani, a self-employed engineer in Puglia. Ten years ago, when he was in his early 20s, he voted for a center-left party that he hoped would push for economic development in southern Italy. When Italy descended into a crippling recession, he felt betrayed by the traditional Italian left-wing parties. He has seen friends struggle to find jobs, and said his own business opportunities are limited to the stagnant private sector, because commissions for the public sector are usually awarded to people with connections he doesn’t have.

Mr. Gaetani, now 33, voted for 5 Star in the 2013 election, a choice he repeated in March with more conviction. “5 Star is our last hope. If they also fail, I think I’ll stop voting,” he said.

The employment rate of Italians under 40 fell every year from 2007 to 2014 before flatlining over the past three years, according to Eurostat. Meanwhile, it has risen every year for those between 55 and 64 years, in part due to an increase in the retirement age.

The number of Italians under 34 in absolute poverty—defined as being unable to afford basic goods and services—more than doubled between 2010 and 2016 to 10&amp;#37;, according to the Italian National Institute of Statistics, or Istat. For those over 65, it dropped to 3.8&amp;#37; from 5.4&amp;#37;.

One major problem in southern Europe is a dual employment system in which people with open-ended contracts—often older workers—enjoy ironclad job security and benefits. At the same time, during the downturn, employers began to use more short-term contracts, generally lasting from one month to a year. In Italy, 62&amp;#37; of contracts for those under age 25 were short-term in 2017, up from a quarter in 2000.

387,"Italian policy makers introduced the contracts in the 1990s in part to help young people enter the labor force as a step to permanent work. Employers used them to avoid the cost and hassle involved in firing people. Echoing labor overhauls elsewhere in Europe, Italy introduced a major revamp of work rules in 2014 and 2015 that tried to get employers to use more open-ended contracts, including billions of euros in tax breaks. The most generous breaks expired in 2016.

The efforts didn’t have the desired effect of creating structural change to the labor market that would wean employers off using short-term contracts. In 2016, when the tax breaks were in place, only 13&amp;#37; of new hires were on short-term contracts. Last year, more than four out of five new hires were on short-term contracts, according to Istat.

The 5 Star Movement has lured millions of young voters with promises to roll back new labor rules, give the unemployed and poor a so-called universal basic income of €780 ($905) a month, and abolish unpaid apprenticeship contracts. Its leader, Luigi Di Maio, was a 26-year-old university dropout who lived with his parents when he was elected to parliament in 2013.

389,"The League also made canceling the recent labor revamp a central part of its electoral platform.

Italy’s economic problems played into young voters’ sentiments about immigration during the campaign as well, one of the animating drivers of support for the League. “We can’t host all of Africa,” said Gianluca Taburchi, a 23-year old supermarket employee from Perugia who voted for the League. “We already have our own problems. We have lots of unemployment and unsecure jobs.”

Matteo Salvini, the leader of the League who became a deputy prime minister and interior minister in the new government, promised to return hundreds of thousands of migrants to their countries of origin. 5 Star, which straddles the line on many issues, spoke of stemming illegal immigration, but stopped short of calling for mass deportations.

About 53&amp;#37; of Italians under 35 voted for the two parties combined, according to an Ipsos poll. About 43&amp;#37; of Italians over 65 voted for legacy center-right and center-left parties, while only 28&amp;#37; of young Italians did.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/8rv1zh/the_force_behind_europes_populist_tide_frustrated/e0uee6n/,nolesfan2011,1529279145
390,"Elsewhere, almost 40&amp;#37; of Spaniards under 35 said in an April poll they would vote for far-left Podemos and its political allies in a coming election. In Greece, more than 41&amp;#37; of those age 18 to 24 voted for Syriza in the 2015 election, six points more than the antiestablishment party got across all age groups.

Argyro Maltasoglou, 30, said she voted for Syriza in the 2015 election because she thought the upstart party would make radical changes, especially in terms of policies to help young people. Since graduating from college in 2013, she has been bouncing between short-term contracts lasting less than a year. She has been looking for a job since her short-term contract as a secretary in an Athens hospital expired in March.

The job paid €500 a month, the most Ms. Maltasoglou has earned so far. She has had to accept money from her parents to get by. “This isn’t what I dreamed of when I was studying,” she said. “I would like to have a family, but I wouldn’t dare to think about it now under these conditions.”

One exception to the generational phenomenon is the U.K.’s 2016 vote to leave the EU: 71&amp;#37; of voters age 18 to 24 voted for the country to remain in the bloc, according to a poll by YouGov. Only 26&amp;#37; of those 65 and over voted to remain.

Studies following the Brexit vote showed that, in this case, young Britons valued the increased ease of working, studying and traveling abroad that EU membership brings. At the same time, many older voters viewed leaving the EU as an opportunity for the U.K. to better control immigration.

The pain in southern Europe reflects a feeling across much of the Western world that the younger generation will struggle to surpass their parents in wealth and security. Half of Italians who responded last year to an online survey on jobs site Monster.com said they thought they will earn less over their careers than their parents.

Young Italians, who bore the brunt of the country’s protracted, triple-dip recession, still bear the scars that will affect their career prospects, homeownership and birthrates for decades to come.",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/8rv1zh/the_force_behind_europes_populist_tide_frustrated/e0ueeoi/,nolesfan2011,1529279160

392,"Banks are reluctant to lend to people on short-term contracts, which has helped push up the average age of home buyers to 41.6 years in 2017 from 39.4 years in 2012, according to Fabiana Megliola, head of research for real estate group Tecnocasa. In 2017, 56&amp;#37; of home buyers in Italy were under 45, down 10 percentage points from five years.

The number of Italians getting married has fallen by a fifth over the past decade, according to Istat. In 2016, the last year for which data are available, Italian men got married on average at age 35 and women at 32, in both cases two years later than in 2008. Births hit an all-time low last year.

In a country with strong family ties, parents are stepping in to help adult children. They can often afford to help because they enjoy pensions that are the fruit of decades of generous retirement benefits. Italy spends more than 15&amp;#37; of its economic output on pensions, the most in Europe except Greece.

About half of Italians age 25 to 34 live with their parents, according to Eurostat, almost double the European average and more than in any other Western European country. The number has risen 3 percentage points in the past decade. And more than a third of Italians in their 30s get economic help from their parents or grandparents, according to a survey by agricultural industry association Coldiretti and polling firm Ixè.

Parties such as 5 Star could continue to win over more young voters if they are able to enact some of the pro-youth policies its leaders campaigned on. “I’m not interested in politics because nobody on either side \[of the political spectrum\] is doing much to help young people,” said Giada Gramanzini, a 29-year-old Italian university graduate. She hasn’t found a steady job since deciding not to renew a three-month contract as a full-time receptionist that paid her about $2.70 an hour. Last year, she moved back in with her retired parents and sent out more than 70 resumes before moving to New York last month to try her luck in another country.  


In the March election she voted for a small pro-European party, in what she called a protest against the Democratic Party—the center-left party that ruled the past five years. She didn’t feel 5 Star was ready to govern.

Her father, Emilio, collects a good pension after working most of his career for the Naples municipal administration. Her mother, Daniela, began working full time at 20 and was employed by the city for several decades. She retired last year.

Daniela worries about the late start Giada is getting on adult life. “How can you not be worried about your daughter if at 29 she still hasn’t found her way?” she asks.

That is not true. You need to be classified as a refugee (there are some criteria someone needs to fulfill) to get asylum. And when you don't get asylum you are sent back (the difficulties of actually getting them back is a different discussion).

See we can [kinda] agree on something.  
  
Even the NGOs don't say that the current ( as in last year) situation can and should be continued, instead they advocate for humanity visas and the repeal of regulations that take transport companies into responsibility to check passengers for visas.  
  
&gt; So what you do is try to discourage people from making that journey.  
  
At that point these people have crossed multiple dessert, risked multiple times to be sold in slavery. The biggest killer is the sahara on that trip, not the mediterranean. And even if nobody came to the rescue of these boats there still would be a massive amount of people trying to cross, as to them that's just a bit more risk.  Taking a look at other people trying to cross a sea in inadequate boats, after the vietnam war ended  about 1.5 million people tried to reach Philippines, they had about an 1/4 chance of dying.  
  
Also I wasn't making any argument about any other policy, i was just pointing out that stopping operations that find and rescue people isn't the moral thing to do. But as you're going there I'll give my 2cents on it. Not cheaping out on foreign aid and not letting someone drown aren't mutual exclusive but currently money send home from migrants is the biggest stream of foreign aid, so things are bad. The deals with Turkey or with Lybien to hold back anyone is still collaboration with brutal dictators and at least in the case of lybia these camps have been unhyperbolically discribed as concentration camps by the UNHCR, so we aren't as far of from copping of peoples heads to scare people of after all.

487,"Romance and Germanic languages share a common ancestor and in fact share it with Slavic languages as wel; there are very few languages in Europe (most notable, Basque, Finnic, Hungarian and Turkic) that do not belong to this group which also contains a lot of Asian languages like Hindi, Persian, Kurdish, Pashto and what-not.

It all goes back to the reconstructed Proto-Indo-European noun ""\*ph₂tḗr"" which is written down a bit weirdly because no one is quite sure what the reconstructed phonemes sound like so they give them numbers which ultimately comes from the root ""*peh₂-"" to do with protecting which also is the origin of the modern English verb ""to feed""; hence ""father"" traces its meaning to ""protector"" in a reconstructed sense.

In general you'll find that English words have an ""f/v"" sound where Latinate words have a ""p/b"" sound as per a phonological shift called Grim's law. Other such pairs include the English ""fish"" (Old Germanic reconstruction *fiskaz) and Latin ""piscis"" and modern French ""poisson"" or modern English ""foot"" which is related to the Latin stem ""ped-"" meaning the same as in centipede and similar words.

There are quite a few other such similarities such as that Germanic ""h"" typically maps to Latin ""k"" via the same Grim's law hence we have Old English ""hēofod"" (modern: head) which is a cognate to the Latin ""caput"" which means the exact same thing both showing the h&lt;-&gt;k and f&lt;-&gt;p correspondence.

I just personally hate counting the two Councils together because I feel they are distinct enough to warrant being looked at as two distinct institutions (even if they have a common past).

This in-between state is, I feel, one of those blurry things that contribute to the ordinary citizens's confusion.

I actually think renaming the two institutions should be top priority of the next treaty change. At the very minimum, renaming the ""Council of the EU"" as the ""Council of Ministers"" would make it more easy to understand: ""National Ministers sitting together -&gt; Council of Ministers"".

Also, renaming the European Council as the European Summit Council might help (some languages already distinguish between the two councils.

I mean, spending more on the NHS is pretty popular anyway, there have been protests, it has been used as a stick to beat the Tories in every election since 2010 (And will continue to be, because this doesn't go far enough..) but it seem that the link to brexit has tipped the balance somewhat.

The really silly thing is that there has been a lot of push back (because of the use of the 'brexit dividend' term) from some remain leaning groups, that's quite dangerous for them as the nuanced message of 'it's not coming from payments that would have gone to the EU' is coming across somewhat as 'don't fund the NHS from taxation'..",Royaume-Uni de Grande-Bretagne et d'Irlande du Nord,/r/europe/comments/8rpv9n/nhs_gets_20bn_birthday_present/e0u06nz/,ajehals,1529263594

I think you think of National identity in more abstract terms than me (in terms of worth for example). National identity is simply the greater expression of the simple scientific fact in psychology that humans tend to like other people more if they perceive them to be more similar to them (sometimes in terms of looks, values etc.). People tend to identify themselves the most with themselves, then family, friends, city, region, province then country, then maybe europe and so on.

The maps aren't an issue as they are historical, but the students conclusions are rather striking.

&gt; If Macedonia was that strong, you would have the right to feel worried.

I have no concerns at all about land claims. I don't see that as remotely realistic, primarily because I don't think the FYROMians have those aspirations. But that's not the point.

Well, that's not what I said. I never said that Greece would be overrun or that FYROM would even want to attempt that. Again, that;'s not the point.

What is possible and likely is that FYROM would leverage their ""constitutional obligation"" to stir local hostilities in the northern region of Greece as a means of applying pressure on any number of issues, primarily trade disputes and legal conflicts of product origin labeling (which exist even today).

OK, I understand. In that case you should really have the word ""relatively"" in there, because it's only easy compared to a very difficult thing.

&gt; I assume you don't suggest local elections are illegitimate and should be done away with?

I never suggested any election should be done away with. I do think local elections have a legitimacy problem, yes. They're quite important but the perception of them as such is low. 

&gt;If people decide not to wield the powers granted to them by law it doesn't mean they somehow don't have those powers. 

The right to vote does not in and of itself guarantee democracy, the effective rule of the people, whether used or not. With that said, if loads of people don't bother, it's a lot easier for democracy to be subverted.

&gt;there is no arbitrary percentage where somehow a democracy becomes illegitimate if a X% decide its not worth bothering with voting.

758,"&gt; Doch. Economic growth is just not fast enough for that. The whole GDP of Denmark is something between 200-300 billion euros. You can only concentrate 100 billion euros at the hand of someone by redistributing it from the others.

Yes, you can. As the other user points out, almost all billionaires are self made. This is not surprising, [given that the world's entire wealth was basically created only very recently](http://2oqz471sa19h3vbwa53m33yj.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/gdp-world.jpg). 

Billionaires could not have inherited their wealth as you have suggested in your other response, because there wasn't that much wealth to begin with. It is not a sort of treasure passed down through the generations, but generated by economic innovation. We are not living in a static world. 

On the contrary, the class that inherited wealth is the upper middle class. The lawyers, the doctors, the small town politicians. That's the jobs that are essentially passed down through the families.

Ok, and why *should* China be allowed to be at the top? Because they're an early civilisation? So were parts of the Middle East. Maybe we should all have Sharia then? 

China then and China now are two entirely different things anyway, and I don't think that independent countries should have to bend to the will of some foreign power. 

Secondly, China's civilisation, morals, and policy are so different from my own - and Europe's - that I do believe, to maintain European security, we do need to do everything we can to curb China's influence on Europe.

893,"Actually, I'd argue the Hungarians had [a much better version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goulash_Communism) of communism than East Germany.

Ironically, the idea of farms, businesses or factories belonging to the hard-working people is what communism is all about, as the workers that toil in them don't tend to be the owners. And in many countries at the time, the owners exploited their workers quite a bit for the purpose of profit maxizmitation. The US are no stranger to this, if you think back to the era when mining companies would use private security forces or the national guard to suppress miners on strike for better living conditions.

But yes, I don't come from a family that owned any factories or farms. We were just normal people owning a house.

Stalin/gulags/red terror (all part of the same era/government, just like the invasions of Poland and Hungary) certainly are part of communism's history, just like Hitler/Chile/Vietnam/Indonesia are part of capitalism's. The question is whether we should take individual incidents or governments and allow that to represent the *entire* ideology or the individual nation for all eternity regardless of its current government, or whether we should perhaps be more careful and distinguish between certain eras and regions.

Also note that mass famines have occurred in USSR territories and China *all the time* even before those countries became communist. That they stopped happening at some point could thus be attributed to a government finally managing to stabilize food supply (although in reality the biggest change was probably just industrialization, that is improved farming practice as well as transportation).

And there would have been at least one democratic communist country, if the US hadn't supported an illegitimate coup. When you say the Chilean Army bears sole responsibility, you're ignoring the US role in indirectly (via economic warfare) and directly (via CIA propaganda, bribery and incitement operations) working towards the putsch.

More interesting documents on the subject: https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB8/nsaebb8i.htm

And it appears you have not answered my question on those alleged constitutional breaches. I *know* his political opponents claimed so, but what were they, exactly?

&gt; You can't steal property from a country's citizens without paying compensation and then expect us to be nice to you.

Absolutely. I merely mentioned this as you seem to have suggested that it was the Soviets who got involved first.

And the *diplomatic* reaction was understandable, but there's a difference between closing all doors in protest, and covertly getting involved in a country's internal affairs -- as Russia did with the recent elections in the west.

&gt; I'm not downplaying this, but you haven't even told me what we did? 

You're right; perhaps I should have went into further detail sooner. The information isn't that hard to come by, so I thought it was more or less ""common knowledge"", but I may have allowed my own subjective readings to influence what I expect of others.

To clarify, the CIA was tasked in [Project FUBELT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_FUBELT) to prevent an Allende presidency and, failing that, create the conditions for a military coup. As per [the CIA's own report](https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol47no3/article03.html), this included funding election campaigns of political rivals, the deployment of false-flag intelligence units, the bribing and manipulation of elected officials, as well as strong assurances that the US would support a military coup. This is in addition to ""softer"" political manipulation as per the so-called Track I approach, meaning the ""manipulation of Chilean congressmen and senators within the framework of the Chilean constitution"" as well as the use of local media for propaganda purposes.

The CIA also delivered three submachineguns and tear gas canisters into the putschists' hands, though it is unclear what exactly was done with them (it's possible they were used in the assassination of General Schneider, though the CIA's contacts assured the Americans this was not the case).

895,"Most of those things were already in effect yes, some of which did have to be revisited. They were still something that had to happen and be confirmed with the new law. In any case way more than the five minutes you've mentioned. And for a lot of these things, there was no reason to ask them or even think about them, let alone spend money on them.   
  
e.g. if a client wished to collect a first and lastname, an e-mailadres, there was no issue previously. Right now if they wish to do so they should explicitly state what that information will be used for, how long it will be stored etc.   

Mind you; I'm not saying it's a bad thing.  
  
No one would spend time and money on unnecessary things, you wouldn't do stuff because it might be needed in the future as a person, neither would a company. Since you have no clue what could be that is needed in the future. In fact, you could be doing the opposite of what is needed. e.g. collect IP addresses of visitors like required in some cases in some countries, the GDPR goes right against that. 

Or a less IT related example: Spend time and money on buying a car and making sure it's able to float indefinitely on water since that might someday be a new EU law. How does that make sense? You'll do it when it has to be done.    
   
You also mention ""big company"" and ""important data"", could you define what those mean to you in this regard? 

You even make it sound like it should be some form of punishment. Odd position to start from but perhaps that's my interpretation of your words. It might not help that you're asking for your view on ""five minutes"" to be changed, and all you can do is say the ""process"" would've been ""deserved"".

You're not improving the gene pool by allowing these fetus to come to life since they'll usually die at an early stage of life anyway, before having the ability to reproduce if they even have that ability, and their siblings sometimes inherit similar diseases with terrible prognosis. They're also seen as inferior, or aberrations and are marginalized by society, meaning they won't have the ability to reproduce. My point being, if they live to become adults they won't pass their genes because most of the time they won't find a partner and when they do it is someone who also shares the same abnormalities worsening the odds for the fetus to inherit genetic mutations from the parents which can ultimately lead to miscarriages.

Aren't all living organism a bunch of cells in essence? Or are you insinuating a fetus is no different from cancer or a tumour?

Are coma patients sentient beings or just a bunch of cells?

Nobody is saying that. 

&gt; Why would you then blame her for ending a pregnancy in a phase when the fetus is still in a stage where it isn't in any way resembling a sentient being?

Because they would be ending a life. Sentiency isn't the determining factor whether something can be considered a life or not. If you'd have to determine at which stage a fetus can be considered a life then anything but conception would be an arbitrarily chosen point aka some people would disagree with your definition and you would disagree with others definition of what constitutes a life. Life then would be an ambiguous term.

&gt;The Uprising of 1953 in East Germany started with a strike by East Berlin construction workers on 16 June 1953. It turned into a widespread uprising against the German Democratic Republic government the next day. In Germany, the revolt is often called People's Uprising in East Germany (*Volksaufstand in der DDR*). It involved more than one million people in about 700 localities. 17 June was declared a day of national remembrance in West Germany up until reunification. Strikes and working class networks, particularly relating to the old Social Democratic Party of Germany, anti-fascist resistance networks and trade unions played a key role in the unfolding of the uprising.

&gt;The uprising in East Berlin was violently suppressed by tanks of the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany and the *Volkspolizei*. In spite of the intervention of Soviet troops, the wave of strikes and protests was not easily brought under control. Even after June 17th, there were demonstrations in more than 500 towns and villages.


[...]


&gt;Early on 17 June 40,000 protesters had gathered in East Berlin, with more arriving throughout the morning. Many protests were held throughout East Germany with at least some work stoppages and protests in virtually all industrial centers and large cities in the country. Joint strike committees were established in Hennigsdorf, Görlitz, Cottbus, and Gera.

&gt;The original demands of the protesters, such as the reinstatement of the previous lower work quotas, turned into political demands. SED functionaries took to the streets and began arguing with small groups of protesters. Eventually, the workers demanded the resignation of the East German government. The government decided to violently suppress the uprising and turned to the Soviet Union for military support. In total, around 16 Soviet divisions with 20,000 soldiers as well as 8,000 *Kasernierte Volkspolizei* members were used to quell the uprising.

&gt;In East Berlin, major clashes occurred along Unter den Linden (between the Brandenburger Tor and Marx-Engels-Platz), where Soviet troops and *Volkspolizei* opened fire, and around Potsdamer Platz, where several people were killed by the *Volkspolizei*. It is still unclear how many people died during the uprising or were sentenced to death in the aftermath. The number of known victims is 55; other estimates put the number of victims at least 125.

1142,"I'm a huge supporter of economic equality in general but I have to agree to the previous argument if I understood it correctly. Those billionaires often create world class companies. Since there is a lack of the ultra wealthy creating or maintaining large companies Denmark is at threat of becoming ""foreign owned"" in the sense that all the small companies are sold to foreign conglomerates who take the profits out of Denmark. The neoliberal phrase that capital has no nationality is unfortunately still not true. Like it or not we still live in a market economy and creating new large companies is what makes the economical wheels spin. It's better if the billionaires who own the companies live in your country than abroad due to them paying taxes in your country, giving to charities in your country and reinvesting their profits in your country.

It's the exact same situation here in Czechia. We have very low income inequality but that is also due to the fact that ""our"" 1% does not live here at all.

This is a late post but you're wrong. 

Most of the European colonial powers during that era were already kicked out by local powers, with the Travancore kingdom [crippling the Dutch East India Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Colachel) and the Maratha kingdom flattening Portuguese influence (with the Mughal Empire having to come in at the end to save them).

The only real threat was the French India Company which was run by incompetent officials, so it's no real surprise why they got defeated so easily.

This gives a much greater flexibility for companies with a wide scope of capabilities, so what was a dedicated wind turbine fleet becomes a general service ship fleet that just so happens to be owned by the same people that own the turbine installation company and they both share an admin service provider they also own.

New companies pop up and compete regularly in unregulated markets. You don't need to be top dog you just have to find a nitch. That's why capitalism provides so many different and unique services for so many different people.

&gt;They would simply buy competitors (as capitalism intends),

That's actually not a capitalistic phenomenon. It's because of central banking (a socialist institution we call the Federal Reserve) that offers ZERO or even NEGATIVE interest rates that allows mega corporations to take out risk free loans to buy out their competitors. This money comes out of the pockets of the American people in various ways including increased inflation and less competition in the market place that causes decrease in quality of product.

I understand the meme's that are repeated about capitalism by people of socialist leanings. This conversation has shown some of them and I'm glad I've been able to clear some of that up for you.

&gt;and the barrier to entry is several billions of dollars. You will not find investors eager to compete at this level I'm afraid.

Again, entering a market isn't about being a top dog its about finding a niche (that sometimes turns you into a top dog).

Sure, they are in more expensive areas but they get to deduct these land (read ""rent"") expenses now and have the luxury to afford it. 

Also, let's talk about basic psychology. If the corporate tax rate replaced with a land tax, how do you think companies will react? Will they keep moving to big cities, leave, or stay? High taxes deter behavior. This is why Americans smoke less than before and why Europeans don't own many cars (obviously infrastructure has something to do with this too, but argument is the car purchase tax).

Look at the financials of a tech company. If you're telling me that you want to get rid of their corporate tax and replace it with a land tax, then you need a wake up call. They will save a shit ton of money by moving from LA to Vegas or Portland or London to Riga. They'll save even more on legal expenses used to utilize tax loopholes under the current system.

The degrees you get wont have the same value at all and in France, the types of degrees are extremely important

There is no problem with having billionaires around as long as poverty isn't an issue. It doesn't matter if your neighbour is ten times, a hundred times or a thousand times richer than you as long as you are well off and your life improves. The issue is poverty, not inequality. 

Wealth isn't a zero-sum game, today less than ever. If Denmark creates a 100 billion dollar startup tomorrow inequality will have increased, but no Dane will be worse off. ",Germany,/r/europe/comments/8rlfro/income_mobility_across_generations/e0szros/,Nyxisto,1529208905

You essentially have to define it, so say a men's group providing support for men who have suffered domestic violence could exclude women because of how the support is tailored.  Generally you have a different issue if you provide a service (like printing..) that is entirely unrelated to the gender, sexuality, race, age (or whatever other protected characteristic you want to pick), and where the discrimination isn't for a legitimate reason, but rather one based on the personal preference of the person providing the service. 

I could (probably, someone correct me if I'm wrong..) provide a men's only tailoring service, or a men's only hairdressing service, because my skill set is essentially gendered - I've trained only to cut men's hair, or produce men's clothing, but I couldn't run a hairdressing or tailoring service that only serves straight men (jokes about fashion sense aside for the moment).

If however you can think of a reason why printing for an LGBT business forum would be somehow different from printing for any other business forum, or why it would require a different approach, or some different skill set, I'd love to hear them.

1438,"**Communism**

Yeah the US really hates communism. The US is really individualistic so the idea of confiscating farms, businesses, or factories that hardworking people created sounds like tyranny. Or preventing people from making their own living.  

When you say ""I didn't feel very oppressed"" growing up in East Germany, I would imagine that you probably wouldn't feel very oppressed because you grew up in communism so at the time you didn't know anything different (also East Germany was the best managed and wealthiest communist state).  When we think of communism, we think also of communism starting. The idea that someone would come and steal all our property from us. Property we worked hard for for ourselves and our families. You have to nationalize property first to start communism. 

You probably were born after all that stuff was nationalized, and there probably was not that much property worth much to nationalize in East Germany right after World War II. 

Also, when we think of communism, we think of Stalin, gulags, red terror. Invasion of Poland (USSR invaded Poland with the Nazis at the same time as allies in 1939), the Invasion of Hungary, The invasion of Czechoslovakia. The North Korean invasion of South Korea. The imposition of communist client states in Eastern Europe after WWII. 

Also, the USSR was the other hostile superpower against us. So we associated communism a lot more with ""the enemy"" b/c of the cold war when they had nukes and guns pointed at us. And because they were the other superpower, there was sort of this feeling in the US that there had to be one of us standing at the end of it, like us or them. And we thought it was like a battle of ideology and we wanted to prove our way of life was just or good and that they were evil (this is just how people in the US grew up to think about communism). 

And... there were no democratic communist countries. Instead they had to seize power by force everywhere. It seemed like an ideology opposed to democracy. The US has had democracy for a long time and we like to think of ourselves as the inventors of modern democracy (whether that's true or not, I'm just saying that's what Americans think, or the national myth of the US). 

Also the mass famines of the Soviet Union in the 1920-30s or of red China in the 1950s.  

I mean, what did we do bad that comes even close to all that? I'm not talking about East German communism, but ""communism"" in general. We were not thinking of just East Germany. 

**Chile** 

First, I want to say that I retract what I previously said after looking into it. The US did not help overthrow Allende. The Chilean Army did it themselves. 

To answer your points though: First the elected legislature accused him of violating the constitution in a vote of 81-47. That's a lot of elected political opponents, many of who supported his candidacy when he first ran.

&gt;On 22 August 1973, with the support of the Christian Democrats and National Party members, the Chamber of Deputies passed 81–47 a resolution that asked ""the President of the Republic, Ministers of State, and members of the Armed and Police Forces""[\[38\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_Chilean_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat#cite_note-38) to ""put an immediate end"" to ""breach\[es of\] the Constitution . . . with the goal of redirecting government activity toward the path of Law and ensuring the Constitutional order of our Nation, and the essential underpinnings of democratic co-existence among Chileans.""

Then the Supreme Court chimed in

&gt;In August 1973, a constitutional crisis occurred; the [Supreme Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Chile) publicly complained about the government's inability to enforce the law of the land. On 22 August, the Chamber of Deputies (with the Christian Democrats united with the National Party) accused the government of unconstitutional acts and called upon the military to enforce constitutional order.

Your questions:

&gt;Are you aware that the Soviets only started to prop him up after the US cut off relations? And why would you criticize that, but not the 2.6 million dollars the US spent on the election campaign of his rival?

The US cut-off relations because he nationalized US owned copper industries in Chile. That was US property that American had invested and developed in Chile. He stole from US citizens. How would you like it if Trump nationalized VW's factory in the US? You can't steal property from a country's citizens without paying compensation and then expect us to be nice to you. 

I did not know off the top of my head that the US spent $2.6 million to finance his rival in 1962 a decade before the coup. That was wrong. That might be the worst thing we did in Chile. 

&gt;The US deliberately helped prop up a *capitalist* dictatorship (I couldn't help but notice your choice of words re/ ""non-communist"") and, due to the actions of its intelligence service, shares responsibility for countless dead or tortured Chileans. Don't downplay this just because it doesn't fit into the good-vs-evil narrative you were going for with your description of communism -- the world is not black and white, but rather shades of grey.

Where? What did we do? How did we prop them up? With what when? I'm not downplaying this, but you haven't even told me what we did? The US had an arms embargo on the Military regime from 1976 until democracy was restored. 

You have no right to accuse of of the responsibility of ""countless dead"" until you even tell me what we did to aid their murders. I want to see real evidence: declassified CIA documents, testimony of Chilean regime officials, testimony of former active CIA agents. I don't want far-left conspiracy theories.

**Germany**

&gt;As for Germany, what was the alternative supposed to be? NATO had plans to use nuclear weapons on German soil (to the point that mini-nukes were stored for use in artillery bombardment). Germany just happened to be where both blocs would have clashed. And if it wouldn't have been for Germany, the US would have deployed their troops in France. And if it wouldn't have been France, they would have done so in Spain.

NATO planned to use tactical mini-nukes to blow up Warsaw Pact tanks. So what? NATO was not planning on using large nukes against civilian areas. Mini-nukes are like you say, small nukes. They are good at blowing up tanks. Germany is a big country, and you are complaining that NATO planned on using bombs to blow up a few square kilometers to defeat  invading Warsaw Pact tanks i*n order to protect West Germany.* You think you are accusing us of something, but all I hear you accuse us of is having a good strategy to protect our own democratic allies in the event the Warsaw Pact invaded us. Guilty as charged. 

  
And also remember, Germany is not a victim here. The only reason that the border between NATO and the Warsaw Pact was in Germany was because it was Germany's fault. You realize that you, the German people, invaded Russia from the East and then you invaded France from the West.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German\_declaration\_of\_war\_against\_the\_United\_States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_declaration_of_war_against_the_United_States)

  
Then Russia defeated you in the East, we defeated you in the West, and then Russia and us met in the middle of Germany. If you didn't want there to be a border in Germany then you should have won World War II. You can't start a war, lose that war, and then complain about the bad situation of losing it. If you didn't want to have a border down your country, you should have fought harder in World War II. 

You make it sound like NATO took advantage of Germany? The Russians treated *you* badly in East Germany. The US, on the other hand, gave billions of dollars in aid to West Germany, made it into a democracy, and stationed hundreds of thousands of troops there to protect it from Stalin. NATO was just an organization that represented all the democracies. Russia was dismantling factories in East Germany to ship back home while were were rebuilding West Germany with billions of dollars in US taxpayer money.  
It's not relative, we're a lot fucking better than the USSR was. That's a low bar.  


&gt;As you said, it's just geography. And the Domino doctrine that compelled the US to try and contain communism in the European theater. Or Vietnam. Or Chile. And so on. You can argue that the Soviets were, on average, ""less good"" than the US (especially given the United States' important role for helping to establish the democratic society the European Union is today), but let's not act as if either side could claim the role of a saint.

I still don't understand what you are even accusing us of bad yet? Yes, our doctrine was to confront communism everywhere because we believe it is bad. That's a good thing. We have said that out loud many times, it's not a secret. What else should we have done?

  
**Domino Theory**   


&gt;And of course the US have been at domestic risk of communism, or at least were convinced of it: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domino\_theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domino_theory) If you really think the US at the time only acted out of the good and selfless hearts of its people, I'd say that is a bit revisionist.

No no no no no. This is all wrong. Domino theory has nothing to do with fears of domestic communism in the US. Trust me, that I know more about American politics and history than you do. Domino theory was the ""theory"" that if one state started to be communist, it would increase the likelihood that another state nearby  would. The US wanted to fight communism, and domino theory was just an excuse we told ourselves to justify that we should fight it everywhere. 

  
The purpose of ""Domino Theory"" was a justification for us to fight communism in small countries. US presidents wanted to intervene to stop communism in small countries in South East Asia. Lots of people then asked, is it really worth fighting it if it's just a smaller country? Domino theory was an excuse to then intervene in that smaller country, presumably to prevent a larger other nearby country from also becoming communist.   
It was an excuse we told ourselves to justify fighting communism in small countries in South East Asia. Nobody literally believed that each neighboring country from South East Asia to the US would fall into communism like dominoes.

  
The US has never had a domestic communist movement. Communists could not ever just seize power in the US like they did in Europe. The people are conservative, the military is conservative, the country has a huge land mass, and we all have guns. 

  
You realize that the US Federal government is 230 years old? We use the same constitution that George Washington signed in 1788 today. Washington was the first president, and Trump is the 45th president consecutively.  And we even had democracy for 150 years before 1788 when we were small colonies before we separated from the British Empire. We've had democracy ever since we left England 400 years ago.   


I'm not trying to brag, I'm just saying that when you have a governmental system for that long, it turns into the people's DNA. We associate the system with ourselves and our culture. People give the constitution and the system of government reverence, like it was the Quran for a muslim.

With his colleagues, Fermi subjected more than 60 elements to neutron bombardment, using a Geiger-Müller counter to detect emissions and conducting chemical analyses to determine the new radioactive isotopes produced. Along the way, they found by chance that neutrons that had been slowed in their velocity often were more effective. When testing uranium they observed several activities, but they could not interpret what occurred. Some scientists thought that they had produced transuranium elements, namely elements higher than uranium at atomic number 92. The issue was not resolved until 1938, when the German chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann experimentally, and the Austrian physicists Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch theoretically, cleared the confusion by revealing that the uranium had split and the several radioactivities detected were from fission fragments"".",Italy,/r/europe/comments/8rkdk4/thank_you_italy_for_helping_out_with_the_forrest/e0smdqi/,RomeNeverFell,1529191730

this is why I analogized the confederacy and not a Klan meeting, because yes you were making a political point not a racial one. 
 
 That said, splitting off a union is still a very bad idea. I mean at what level do you believe an authority loses legitimacy? I'm going to use the US as my example because that's what I know best: 
 
Confederates would have said the government loses authority beyond the state level because the federal government is *too big* and too disconnected from the people who voted for them to properly represent them. But some states ('countries' in the EU) are really big too; are all my state representatives connected and not too big to properly represent me?  
 
What if I think my state government is too big, and illegitimate? What if I think my county government is too big and illegitimate? What if I think my local township government is too big and illegitimate? 
  
Do I just get to become President of my own house? Am I a king of my own personal kingdom of self?  
  
----- 
 
 If you're going to draw a cutoff point for when an organization becomes illegitimate, you need concrete reasons to explain why the electoral process of MEPs is inherently less legitimate than the same process which chooses your countries President or MP.

You should define a characteristic that define a city as the worst at its perspective. For example what's the dirtiest city in Europe? 

For example Paris is one of the best cities in Europe, surely in the top 3. But maybe it is the worst city for someone who speak only English and not French if he want to ask For directions etc.

The whole point of the Bretton Woods system of free trade was to unify the world's once-warring countries under a single rubric in order to contain, beat back, and destroy the Soviet Union. In this order Germany was no longer an isolated target, but instead an integrated bulwark. With Germany and France and Spain and Italy and Britain and Sweden and Turkey and more all on the same side, the Germans could for the first and only time in their history expand economically without risk of invasion (except from the Soviets, of course). The time since the Bretton Woods era kicked off has not ""simply"" been the greatest period of peace and prosperity in human history, but it has been the only period of peace and prosperity in German history.

I say this without hyperbole: without Americans underwriting Bretton Woods, there is no free trade. No free trade, no EU and NATO.

1827,"&gt; First, the poll numbers are not the same was what a country would vote in a referendum to make the EU a federation or a stronger one.

You're moving the goalpost a bit here. We weren't discussing technicalities but the willingness of the people, which you said would not exist due to a focus on nationality. And it was the president of France that just proposed a common EU finance minister.

Where you are correct is that IGC decisions have to be made unanimously (excepting use of the Passerelle clause or Article 333 TFEU for enhanced cooperation a la ""multi-speed Europe"", of course), but in the end this just comes down to what exactly is on the table at the moment. After all, this limitation did not prevent the levels of joint operation that have been achieved thus far.

Will we eventually come to a point where any deeper integration will become impossible due to public opinion in a few member states? Most certainly. We will simply have to wait and see when exactly this point is reached, if it moved after another couple years or even decades, or if it's even feasible to keep any and all current member states in the union when they unilaterally prevent the rest from progressing further, like the UK at times did in the past.

&gt; The EU is not that old. You keep on saying ""its'a matter of time"" like it's inevitable, but it's not.

It's old enough to have already undergone several significant changes. It's old enough that an entire generation has grown up knowing only the EU (which is why you see such an age difference in Brexit referendum demographics, or among EU citizen identity polls). You're acting like this union still is the same as it was when it was proclaimed. It's not. And it won't be the same ten years from now. Its process of federalization, whilst at times running into walls, has so far only ever moved in one direction.

Friction and problems may arise from federalization. They can also be *avoided* by federalization, due to increased cooperation and better management (your mention of Hungary and Poland not following EU law would be one example). In the end, we will always be stronger together.

&gt; A real 'EU military"" would be a single EU Navy, a single Army under one command structure.

That's like saying the US doesn't have a real military because the National Guard exists separately from the federal army. As long as the capabilities for joint operations exist, why should there be a problem?

France would retain control of its nukes just like it does with NATO. The French president being France's CiC did not prevent French troops from participating in EUFOR missions, or NATO. The decision when to use the military is made by the Council, which is already the case. Troop deployments are decided and agreed upon during the Foreign Affairs Council (..and Germany never had any troops in Libya it could have pulled out). Defense spending allocation is up to PESCO commitments; that's part of what this agreement was about. Actually, Ireland and Austria are already sending troops to the EU Battlegroups in 2020; participation in this project will remain voluntary. If NATO countries want to do something with NATO that doesn't go against their treaties with the EU they are free to do so, just like NATO countries may decide to do something with the UN but not NATO. There's no reason why NATO and the EU's own defense cannot co-exist as long as each member state manages to fulfill its obligations; if not they'll just have to pick. And Consensus happens in the Council and Parliament, like it did for PESCO and the first 17 projects that resulted out of it.

You're just grabbing random arguments out of thin air that could just as well be leveled at NATO, an alliance that *somehow* managed to come into existence and present a sufficient united front in spite of all these factors. Why is one group of countries oh-so-different from another group of countries that's largely comprised of the same nations? You seem convinced that Europeans cannot get anything done without US leadership. I think a number of European countries has acquired sufficient experience to step up -- not in the least because a number of the officers involved have spent time at NATO.

Let's also not forget that dependence on a US-led NATO did not only bring us protection from the Soviet Union, but also [Gladio](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/European_Parliament_resolution_on_Gladio), as well the knowledge that European contributions to NATO apparently aren't as well regarded as we had hoped.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/8redor/germany_wont_meet_nato_2_spending_obligation/e0s2ufl/,akashisenpai,1529169433

1831,"&gt; Poor people make more babies, everywhere.

This is simply not true. Eastern Europe is way poorer than Western Europe, and some Eastern European countries that are not in the EU could be compared with African countries by the levels of their poverty. Yet the number of children born in those Eastern European countries is very low and is constantly decreasing. 

&gt; Since the 1950s, 8 million moroccans migrated to Europe, Israel and America, if all those people didn't migrate, we would be fucked. 

I'm glad that Morocco is doing better now, but the Moroccan immigration, as a whole, has not been a positive for the native Europeans. A lot of the terror attacks committed in Europe have been done by immigrants or descendants of immigrants from Morocco. And a lot of the religious/cultural tensions that are happening in the Western EU is due to them. As such, I hope this immigration will be decreased in the future.

1943,"\&gt;First of all, that's not a bodybuilder and there's no way all those people have a body fat of 15&amp;#37;

I didn't call it ""body builder"", the guy above said I must be one to throw off the BMI scale, I'm pointing out the contrary - that casual gym going can easily throw off the BMI scale. also Body fat relates to your diet, not your gym time, and sweden is very health conscious with diet and things so it's not at all unlikely

\&gt; Measuring body fat is a crap shoot anyways and has loads to do with genetics

the role of genetics is overblown as an excuse for people who aren't where they want to be in terms of their diet (not counting gender). The laws of thermodynamics are universal and don't care about your genetics; energy in - energy out = energy store.

\&gt; Even using your definition, you seriously believe one in 5 people in Sweden goes to the gym?

15&amp;#37; is not 1 in 5, and yes I do think 15&amp;#37; is somewhere in the ballpark, like I said going to the gym is not a male exclusive thing in sweden so our numbers would be almost 2x that of some other countries.

\&gt; You genuinely believe 20&amp;#37; of the people in Sweden hit the gym 4 times a week?

you keep inserting numbers from nowhere, where did I say 20&amp;#37; or 4 times per week? [there are some stats](http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/288126/SWEDEN-Physical-Activity-Factsheet.pdf) and while this doesn't measure gym-going exclusively there is plenty of room for 15&amp;#37; gym goers at least as supplement to other activities or hobbies.

1949,"&gt;Unfortunately, as the numbers mentioned above show, this isn't the case for all member states, but thankfully a representative democracy does not require 100&amp;#37; agreement to function. This, too, isn't any different from the US and the political leanings of its various states.

First, the poll numbers are not the same was what a country would vote in a referendum to make the EU a federation or a stronger one. I seem to recall France, Ireland and the Netherlands voting that down last time. Yeah, even France. It's a completely different animal once people realize how much power they would actually giving up and what that would entail. 

Second, it doesn't require 100&amp;#37; agreement to function. It requires 100&amp;#37; agreement to federalize. Need every state to ratify to make treaty changes. And the EU didn't do itself any favors when it told Ireland to vote again. 

&gt;And, feel free to contrast those numbers with [this pew poll on the current levels of trust in the US](http://www.pewglobal.org/2017/06/26/tarnished-american-brand/).

Hmmm... Poland looks pretty high. I'm sure they will torpedo any new EU treaty changes or EU army.

&gt;Unless the European Union breaks apart under the weight of the temporary but no less concerning problems it is currently experiencing, federalization is really just a matter of time, as it is committed to continue deepening its ties, as it has always done, for decades

I don't see what's temporary. I think the Euro has some serious structural defects. The fact that Hungary and Poland aren't even following EU law is also there. I mean Brexit.

The EU is not that old. You keep on saying ""its'a matter of time"" like it's inevitable, but it's not. Nothing is inevitable and the EU is in more strain now than ever before in its short life. The more federalized it gets the more friction and problems are gonna arise. 

&gt;Previous joint operations have suffered considerably from differing standards. You'd have troops show up with ""12 different rifles, 12 different spare parts and 12 different sets of ammunition and two different types of amored car"", to quote General Aherne. PESCO is a *binding* agreement to develop standards in equipment and training as well as new technology for easier integration of better prepared multinational troops, which in turn is an obvious tie-in for the [already existing operational headquarters](https://euobserver.com/foreign/137127). This has been decades in the making, and recent geopolitical events have kicked it into overdrive; how is it not a milestone?

1. I'm just not really that impressed with it. It's not even a standard, it's an agreement to make standards (for what? just rifles on joint operations that will never see combat), and you say it's binding, that means nothing. What are they gonna sue each other if they can't reach an agreement? It's one of those things that you can't make binding by its very nature. Like ""we have a binding agreement to love each other."" Actions speak louder than words. Show me what this vague agreement means in practice before counting it off as a victory. 
2. The operational HQ is a joke. It has a staff of 200 people in Brussels overseeing peacekeeping missions.  You realize that the only reason the EU agrees to these really low quality and low bar defense cooperations is because they want to be seen integrating, but each state really  isn't at all interested in giving up actual military powers to the EU?

 I'm not trying to degrade or attack you, but I honestly think that you saying the EU HQ, PESCO, and all this stuff is a joke. You're taking mostly symbolic agreements and hyping them up to be some precursor to an EU army. These are so far off from anything related to an EU army. 

A real 'EU military"" would be a single EU Navy, a single Army under one command structure. Who would control French Nukes? Explain to me how France could participate in an EU army since the president of France is the Commander-in-chief of the French Republic? How would the Eu decide when to use its military force? Would pacifist countries like Germany get to pull their troops from it like they did with Libya? How would defense spending get allocated by arms sector? What about the neutral countries like Ireland and Austria? What if the NATO countries need to do something with NATO but not the EU? What if 7 countries refuse to drop their alliance with the US? And how will the EU ever come to a consensus to do all of this stuff?

You have all these extremely substantive and serious questions that aren't even being addressed, and how can you possibly say that having a standardized rifle selection on already dubious joint missions is a step to an EU army? That's not even close. By this rate you'll have an EU army around 2150, but at this rate the Eu will have broken up by then.",,/r/europe/comments/8redor/germany_wont_meet_nato_2_spending_obligation/e0rw9gq/,sandyhands2,1529162407

1964,"&gt; That’s not really voluntary, since the alternative is starving to death.


That's not the only alternative. You could sell your labour to someone else, or you can own your labour and sell whatever you produce. 


&gt; If I held a gun to your head and asked you give me your money, would that be a voluntary transaction?


No, taxes is not a voluntary transaction.


&gt; Taxes are the cost of living in a society.


Great... that's not what I asked. I asked for the definition of theft you're using. But I assume you're just not gonna answer, so lets move on.


&gt; It is effective because every society ever has put into place and done great productive things while doing so.


If all countries have such a system... that per definition means both the produtive and the unproductive countries have that system. What are you talking about...?


&gt; The Social Contract is a book by Enlightenment philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau about the nature of political rights and society.


Right... I thought you were talking about the concept, which of course predates Jacques Rousseau by like 200 years.


&gt; It is an implicit agreement between individual citizens and the governments they elect to govern them.


Let's assume it is an implitic agreement. That's not a contract. A contract is an explicit agreement. That's sort of the entire point of a contract.


&gt; That’s a slogan, not data.


Fine, what are some good examples of governmental activities and processes that are competitive in any market?


&gt; Private companies are driven by profit to accomplish whatever it takes to make that profit 


Yes... that is why they are more efficient. You don't make a profit by being inefficient.


&gt; Drug cartels are private companies too.


Drug cartels enforce their monopolies by violence, just like governments.


&gt; Ironically, Samsung is pretty much a government institution at this point given its relationship with the South Korean government.


""Samsung is pretty much a government institution."" I mean... wow.


&gt; Also, nearly every component of the iPhone and every other smartphone was developed though government-funded research and development


So what? 


&gt; The US, under our current private insurance system, spends more per capita on healthcare than any other nation in the world, while comparatively getting the least coverage


You're gonna have to explain how that's in any way relevant to the specific point you responded to? Of course you won't do that, so I guess I'll just point out that the US =/= free market.


&gt; but the point here is that since the insurance company is a private profit-driven institution, it is incentivized to get as much money as possible out of its policy holders while providing as little coverage as it can get away with.


Yes, and you don't maximize profits by setting uncompetetive prices. 


This is frankly getting boring... how dumb are you? What... I don't... wtf are you talking about?


Can you explain to me why it would probably not be a good business to start an exact replica of Starbucks except with double the prices? Do you understand why that would not be more profitable than starbucks? Yes? No? Maybe?


&gt; I said health insurance specifically is ridiculously coercive because it leverages your life for the sake of profit.


So does companies making airbags. Not coercion.


&gt; What does the insurance company's ""perfect world"" have to do with anything?

&gt;&gt; Perverse incentive structure. Bad for regular people.


Right... that explains how it's relevant to the discussion.


&gt; Coercion is not inherently bad.


We disagree.


&gt; By saying this, you are proving that you do not understand what the Social Contract is.


No, you simply don't understand what a contract is. A contract is a voluntary agreement between parties. The agreement has to be enforceable in order to be a contract.

First of all the social contract is not voluntary, I was never asked. And also it's not enforcable. If the government doesn't uphold it's part of the ""contract"" I have no way of enforcing it.


&gt; Which it can be depending on the circumstances


Sure, anything *can* be. But it's not. Or feel free to hit me with your best examples.


&gt; Do I need to pull up the per capita healthcare spending chart again?


Well I would like you to point to a free market healthcare system first so I can move there.


&gt; A zero-sum game is where one’s success requires another’s failure.


You are correct! Good job!


&gt; In a system where resources are being efficiently used, new wealth is created and being distributed efficiently across the population, which increases wellbeing for everyone involved. Everyone wins.


No, everyone doesn't win. If you pay 100 money in taxes and I only pay 10 money in taxes but we both recieve 50 money's worth of goods and services from the government, I win and you lose. That's a zero-sum game.


&gt; That’s what economists mean when they say Capitalism creates wealth and isn’t a zero-sum game.


No it's not. Please find me any quote from any respected economist for that?

Economists say capitalism isn't a zero-sum game because it relies on voluntary transactions. If I sell you X for $10, you accept the transation because you value X higher than $10 (otherwise you wouldn't accept the transaction) and I accept the transaction because I value $10 higher than X.

I don't know why you pretend to understand economics?


&gt; There is no such thing as property rights without government.


That's not true. Clearly property predates governments.


&gt; It just so happens that government is the most efficient means of enforcing property rights


I agree!


&gt; Stable governments create peace(in a geopolitical sense). Peace is required to have a stable market environment.


... you of course realize government also creates wars? Almost all wars in fact.

But also a stable market environment is actually not a requirement for a free market.


&gt; In a free market, you get rich by convincing people to give you their money, regardless if it benefits them or not. That’s why Heroin and Gambling exist.


No, heroin and gambling exists because people like them and want them. If I really want heroin it would be beneficial for me if you sold me heroin cheaper than anyone else.


But what I really want is that quote from an economist saying capitalism isn't a zero-sum game because it's a system ""where resources are being efficiently used, new wealth is created and being distributed efficiently across the population, which increases wellbeing for everyone involved"". And not because of precieved value in voluntary transactions.


If you're not gonna provide that, or admit you're wrong, you might as well not respond. And if you do respond, please put the refrence or admition of being wrong at the top since I just won't read it otherwise.

2019,"&gt;&gt;  However without colonialism a small country in the north of Europe doesn't amass the wealth it needs to become such a large economy
&gt; 
&gt; Oh yes it does, by being the first country to industralize.

Oh for God sake. What do you think drove the industrial revolution? The money and trade routes driven by colonialism was key to get it up and running. It provided the raw material for industry and the markets to sell product. Equally it makes it harder to get industry set up in your country if you have been colonised by a foreign power who controls your resources etc.

&gt; Britain was also one of the most successful (if not the MOST successful colonist).
&gt; 
&gt; I guess one can claim that, but their wealth wasn't created primarily through exploitation, and a lot of regions have seen heavy development under their rule.

Well I'm not going to get into that with you as well. Feel free to Google the amount of abuse and exploitation on your own time. (Hint: building railways to make it easier to get resources and goods out of a country while transporting soldiers more efficiently served Britain more than the locals)
 
&gt; You're not going to do the few countries I asked about because cases like Japan, who only had a limited empire that lead to its complete destruction, disprove your theory about wealth as somethibg that's plundered from others.

Except I never said that! wealth doesn't have to be plundered from others, though that is the point of a colony. It doesn't mean every colony was equally successful (going back to Spain, they were significantly more wealthy for centuries than they would have been without their colony, it doesn't make it less true because they lost it all).
 

&gt; No you didn't. All you said is repeat the same claim and provided weak arguments that I could easily disprove by pointing to historical examples.

2030,"&gt;I don't get what the UK is spending all that money on - sure there are maintenance costs but if you look at a lot of their military programs most of them are about extending the life of old technology - like the Challenger 2, the Typhoon (not that it is old currently, but it will be especially so when they want to finally get rid of it), Warrior AFV etc

Well there are the new Aircraft Carriers, Frigates and Submarines, the acquisition of the F-35, new missile systems, new vehicles.. I mean, in terms of investment and the Modernising Defence Programme, the equipment plan makes up 40% of defence spending, and that's without including the new F31e's too.

So the UK is spending that money largely on kit, then maintenance, and then maintaining a fairly high operational tempo.

&gt;Secondly, AFAWK they're not developing anything new themselves - they abandoned stealth fighters to join the F35 program, they are co-developing a UAV with the French who are co-developing one with Germany? I think they mentioned they were looking into railgun tech but only promised something like 300 million pounds.

The UK has a fairly decent defence industry, the UK is the only Tier 1 partner on the F35, the joint development with the French is a continuation of BAE's Taranis..  Even in terms of Railgun tech, the UK doesn't seem to have a particular interest at the moment, but it's BAE working with the US navy on their tech.  You also sort of have to factor in that UK/US cooperation is deeper than the US with pretty much anyone else, with the UK producing parts for strategic US assets for example, and of course massive cooperation on intelligence gathering where the UK is arguably the best in the world..

No, the UK isn't just producing things domestically for the hell of it, it works with partners (including France, Germany and the US), but it does that so that it can keep capabilities in the UK and remain competitive in terms of capabilities.

&gt;Also they cling so dearly to the L85. Just accept that it's never gonna be that great and change to a HK or something. You can list statistics all you want but soldiers still complain about the L85. Heck, now would be a great time to change to the HK433 considering Germany is upgrading to it.

Soldiers will complain about any bit of kit that they use, and in that context the SA80 is no different (I've used the A1 and A2 and there is a lot to complain about, but then I've also handled things like the M16A4, HK417 and indeed various AK47 variants and there are always issues..). We'll see where the UK goes next, but if you are complaining about the level of research and spending, individual weapons don't tend to have that much going for them in either area.

2078,"&gt; You do understand that there is a causal link between how much resources you have at your disposal and your quality of life... right?

I lived in America for thirty years, and outside it for twenty five.  

By every objective measure, the quality of life in America is _worse_ than in Europe.  Yes, you have more consumer goods - your error is however believing that your quality of life is measured by the value of the consumer goods you purchase.  People in Europe live longer, healthier lives; they never worry about becoming homeless;  they never worry about getting sick and losing everything. We have much more social mobility than you do, which means that a bright kid from a poor family really does have a chance at ""making it"" here.

I live in the Netherlands.  Salaries are vastly compressed compared to the United States.   Taxes are high.  

And people live excellent lives.  No one worries about being homeless or getting sick and going broke.  We can all see where these high taxes go - I am literally looking out of my window right now at trees and a beautiful canal.  It's safe - little kids play unsupervised in parks late at night and no one thinks anything of it.  

Right before I left the United States, I was deep in Brooklyn to see a concert - not even in a _bad_ neighborhood, but just a mediocre one.  There was trash everywhere.  Then I saw a guy with no legs in wheelchair.  He was literally weeping in despair.  He wasn't even begging or anything - he was just weeping off in the corner.

And I thought two things.  The first was, ""Society has completely failed this man.""  The second, and I'm a little ashamed of it, was, ""Perhaps this is the last time I'll ever have to see this"" - because I knew I was leaving.

Your society is cruel and uncaring and many of your citizens are miserable.  Worse, your obsession with warfare and low taxes has led you to make a series of short-sighted decisions.  

In the last twenty years, you've blown $5 trillion, that's five thousand _billion_ dollars, on pointless wars in places that your average American couldn't even locate on a map, none of which achieved their military, strategic, diplomatic, economic or humanitarian goals.

At the same time, you've cut taxes on the rich, so you did all that warfare on credit - you're going to make your children and your grandchildren pay for it.

Your infrastructure is crumbling and you are doing nothing about it.  A small number of your schools are the best in the world, but a huge number of your schools are the _worst_ in the developed world.  You pay more per person for medical care than any other country in history, and you get far worse outcomes.  The idea of a career - something that was taken for granted by my generation - is not even a dream for the majority of young Americans today.

Objectively speaking, you are fucked.  

Unfortunately, the discourse in your country right now is dominated by a fairly small number of angry, hyperaggressive people:  deeply delusional people, people with no interest in facts, knowledge, or reasoned discourse but simply mockery, violence and dominance of others.  It's like an infectious mental illness, and it is destroying the body politic.

If someone wants to shout out (like, really propagate it, publish it in a book, state them at a public rally, etc) racist bullshit, fascist propaganda, or extreme religious views, and the like, yeah, I think that someone should be fined, because such views don't have a place in our modern society (in my opinion). Noone should be punished for holding legitimate crirical views of others. If they can't critizise someone without resorting to racism, etc, well, then that might not be valid  criticism. 

You may not agree with this point of view, and I may not agree with yours, and that's fine. See, that's the point of democracy. We can both hold legitimate opinions that might not go together, so society has decided that we as a people vote on stuff like that in one way or another. And while I agree that the core of freedom of speech (the freedom to legitimately critizise others without legal repercussion) is non-negotiable, society indeed has the power to decide what else is included. Some societies (like the USA) take it to the max, others exlude one thing or another (like racism or facism). That doesn't make one better or worse than the other.

2119,"Right now I think there are plenty consequences to preaching hate speech without needing to actually explicitly make certain types of speech prohibited. Furthermore, drawing a line on the restriction of speech is where much of the issue comes from when you go down the road of legally recognising the potential for danger in an open marketplace of ideas. Almost everyone can agree that neo-Nazis proselytising in favour of organised mob violence is a pretty uncontroversially destructive form of speech that can be made illegal, consequence free.

But actually, I think that's a pretty short-sighted view of the full consequences. It isn't so clear cut. The issue is that if an idea of that sort is at the point where it has reached such critical mass amongst the general public that it needs lawmaking to tackle, it's already too far gone. Pushing such thought underground changes the nature of all of society's political development and in a sense grants some validation to the idea as a genuine threat to the power of the state and the current sociocultural model. In the case of NSDAP in the 1930s, this actually happened on some level. Impositions on the growing power of the party and ideology came too late to extinguish it and instead made its supporters more virulent in their hope for genuine change at every level of society, and revenge, of the sort promised.

Anyhow, in our own time and place, we can also ask more controversial questions: Are Bolshevik doctrines for overthrowing our current socioeconomic model too dangerous to be allowed to be discussed? It could lead to class warfare, violence, destabilisation of law and order etc if they gain too much traction in the current climate.

Is Islam itself too hateful of an ideology by its very nature to be tolerated? If hate speech includes protections based on sex, gender, and various sexual identities then wouldn't it follow that a majority of Muslims practice hate speech? Same goes for the more radical wings of Christianity, and maybe for a majority of Christianity in relation to their views on homosexuality. Abrahamic religions in general have tendencies to be riddled with homophobia, transphobia and various other forms of speech fairly uncontroversially regarded as hateful. This is usually rooted in the foundational Holy Books of these religions, regardless of what some intersectional theories try and ignore.

'TERFs' believe that the same models which validate transgender identities do so by oppressing and debasing women and that the large-scale adoption of these models is an existential threat of sorts to (cis) women. Trans people will likely have stories about harrassment in the form of hate speech from these same groups and of the existential danger which TERF theories pose to trans people when adopted politically. You probably side with one of these groups. I know I do. What do you think would happen if your side, or the opposing side, was silenced by the state? Either way, I really can't see that it would improve the health of society.

Each time we give up a civil liberty such as freedom of speech, or the right to privacy, as a means of protecting ourselves from some threat, aren't we actively cannibalising our own values as a society? With that in mind, doesn't that make us more vulnerable to political manipulation by foreign actors or otherwise? For instance, the PATRIOT ACT 2001 was pretty indicative of the level of destabilisation and landmark change which terrorist acts could have on Western society; making a rich, stable nation openly chew up the values which defines its national identity, as a means of guarding itself from an ideological opponent. Sophisticated political actors both inside and outside of our societies have taken note of this and acted accordingly. Terrorist groups have implemented this as part of their long term strategy in destabilising the national values held by their opponents. Powerful groups within our nations have and are continuously eroding at these fundamental liberties we have in the pursuit of their own interests and power bases. Giving them up willingly and enthusiastically does not just kill off Nazi ideas in a fantasy vacuum. It's such a lazy, dangerous attitude to take.

You could write about this stuff at great length but I'm not sure that would amplify my own speech in this case whatsoever, so I won't ramble on too much.

When you fight with your spouse/partner, you will use love, sex, money, relatives, etc, as an excuse for the argument. But it's hardly about one thing in particular because no long term relationship is that simple and easy to reduce to one thing only. Personally I use Maslow's pyramid because relationships are about fulfilling each other's needs (even when it's about a whole country). And at the base of the pyramid you have basic needs which are usually solved with money. It's good if you can have all your needs met of course, but if you can't and yet your partner (spouse, country) solves your basic needs and there's such mutual dependence that separating implies not having those needs met anymore, then you will choose to stay together. If it works don't change it. You can agree to disagree and therefore respect each other when you have your basic needs met. It's the case for Switzerland in my opinion, they fulfill their basic needs together, and their cultural needs independently. Whereas for other regions, basic needs that are not fulfilled make the cultural needs even more important.

2443,"Since we're that far down the thread, it's basically only the two of us who are left, so we might as well get personal. 

I was born in the 80s. Back then, the Reds were still around, Germany was right there at the front line and a wholesale army camp, where people like me had to go through ""civil security exercises"" (*Zivilschutzübung*) in elementary school - you know, when the nukes came flying in. The official part was where they told us how to take cover, where the next bomb shelter was, how to survive 30 days in the wild, NATO code lingo (to radio in, provided the next base was still alive and kicking) - things like that.

The older ones back then were told another thing: It's actually best if you move right next to a spot where nukes likely hit the ground. A nuclear holocaust is bad, but worse is the prospect of surviving it in a country that is reduced to a smoldering ruin of death, despair and radiation beyond imagination, where survival meant nothing more than the ""blessing"" of instantly descending into madness.

(Remember: Back then, Germany was scheduled to be hit by *two* nuclear strikes - the offensive one, and the defensive response.)

When the Soviet Union finally came down, the sigh of relief throughout Germany wasn't just because the Iron Curtain was gone and the country reunited, but because something appeared on the horizon that promised a future which heretofore was the stuff for a fairytale: That a **peace dividend** was about to be paid out after so many years of living at the point of two guns. The big enemy is gone, now we can enjoy peace and prosperity - not just Germans, but all of us!

It's not out of spite that the average German isn't quite fond of keeping huge stockpiles of armaments around. And it has nothing to do with our alleged 'pacifism' or, you know, The War^TM - It's just that most Germans don't get it why everyone around us seems to be obsessed with weaponry and death.

2521,"&gt;Well, some people around here still have vivid memories of President Trump presenting an ""invoice"" to Merkel during their first official meeting in the White House. Although our own government tried everything to downplay and bury it, it's been perceived as a huge slight, and it certainly didn't help any efforts to get defence spending up significantly, because that would just seem like the government would be giving in to blatant bullying.

That's not what happened. A British Newspaper, the Sunday Times, made that report by allegedly quoting an anonymous German Minister. The Sunday Times report said this:

&gt;Donald Trump asked the German chancellor Angela Merkel to pay what her country “owed” Nato for defending it when they met last weekend, German government sources have revealed.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Sunday Times has calculated that the sum may exceed £300bn.

[https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/germany-dismisses-white-houses-intimidating-300bn-bill-for-defence-dl7dk629k](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/germany-dismisses-white-houses-intimidating-300bn-bill-for-defence-dl7dk629k)

Then that news reported was picked up and repeated by other news sources all over the world. First, it's fishy because it allegedly relies on anonymous sources. Second it's fishy because ""the Sunday Times has calculated that the sum may exceed"" makes no sense. What did they calculate? Either they knew what he said or they're just making stuff up. Third, it was denied by both the White House and the Germany government.

&gt;It's almost as if Trump *wanted* defence spending to remain that low so he could use it as an excuse for the next rant.

Also... the thing supposedly occurred during a private meeting with Merkel and Trump. If it did happen and the paper isn't making the story up, then the only reason it got released was because an ""anonymous"" German Minister leaked it to the paper.

Which also raises the question? Why would a German Minister tell that to a British Newspaper who broke the story? If he wanted to leak it, he would do it to a German paper. The story had nothing to do with Britain. 

&gt;Let's be honest: If someone up there really wanted it, it could be done easily. The first step which certainly would take a lot of the pressure off would be if someone flew over to Washington and ordered a few of those neat F-35s. By all means, we could use als well as afford them.

2571,"This is true. But look at all the things that the US has done for Germany and you can see the balance and understand the US position more on why it's frustrated with Germany's reluctance to spend:

The US  stationed 400,000 troops in West Germany during the Cold War and it was the US that demanded West Germany and East Germany be allowed to unify despite the fact that the leader of the UK, Thatcher, and the leader of France, Mitterand, both wanted to keep Germany from reunifying because they wanted to keep Germany weak. That's what Reagan's whole ""tear down this wall"" speech was about. We overruled France and the UK to demand Germany be allowed to unify.

And speaking of the EU.. you know that French guy Jean Monnet? The founding father of the EU? Monnet released a plan, called the Monnet Plan:

&gt;The Monnet Plan proposed giving France control over the German coal and steel areas of the [Ruhr area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruhr_area) and [Saar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saarland) and using these resources to bring France to 150&amp;#37; of pre-war industrial production. The plan was adopted by [Charles de Gaulle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_de_Gaulle) in early 1946.  
&gt;  
&gt;In September 1946, the US government stated in the Stuttgart speech [Restatement of Policy on Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restatement_of_Policy_on_Germany) that it would accept the French demands on the Saarland, but that: ""the **United States will not support any encroachment on territory which is indisputably German or any division of Germany which is not genuinely desired by the people concerned**. So far as the United States is aware the people of the [Ruhr Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruhr_Area) and the [Rhineland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhineland) desire to remain united with the rest of Germany. And the United States is not going to oppose their desire.""

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monnet\_Plan#The\_Saar\_Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monnet_Plan#The_Saar_Area)

You do realize that like 80 million ethnic Germans live in the US, way more than french people? The US forced the Frenchman/EU founding father Jean Monnet and De Gaulle to back down because it was unacceptable to allow France to do that to Germany. They wanted to enslave Germany like they had done after World War I.

Instead of enslaving Germany again, we forced the French to unify West Germany and the US paid to help rebuild West Germany with American taxpayer money.

And then the US airlifted to supply West Berlin  when the Soviets blockaded it in an attempt to starve it out.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin\_Blockade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Blockade)

The US did all of this for Germany. Despite the fact that Germany declared war on the US for no reason.

Maybe because it's a juicy story that sold web traffic and there was no way they could get caught making it up because they used ""anonymous sources."" I don't want to get in the ""fake news"" territory, but the whole ""The Sunday Times has calculated that the sum may exceed £300bn"" sounds fake as fuck. Did Trump give a math formula to Merkel that the Sunday Times had to calculate? The fact they said they had to calculate it means that he didn't even say a specific number. 

Or maybe.... the anonymous German minister made the story up in a false leak he told the paper. The Germany government knows it won't be able to increase spending politically, and like you said ""It's almost as if Trump *wanted* defence spending to remain that low."" This fake leak gave the German government political cover to not increase spending because they don't want to be seen giving into a bully. (This is a conspiracy theory I am making up, but it would only take one German minister acting on his own to do it. It's plausible)

&gt;Whether ""fake news"" or not, a great many people around here believed it, and since perception is 90&amp;#37; of reality, it had an impact. Particularly because it seemed completely plausible that Trump would pull such a stunt.

2717,"WHEN Britons voted to leave the European Union two years ago, they had no chance to say what sort of Brexit they wanted. But Theresa May, who became prime minister in the aftermath of the referendum, quickly decided that they wanted the most drastic break possible. Without consulting her cabinet, let alone Parliament, she announced “red lines” for her negotiation with Brussels that put Britain on course for the fullest of separations.

This “hard” Brexit—in which Britain would free itself from the clutches of European judges, trade policy and migration rules, at significant cost to its economy and security—has long looked inevitable. Parliament’s resistance to Mrs May’s extreme plan has been timid and the Labour opposition feeble. Yet this week the tide turned. Rebel Tory MPs look likely to wrest control of Brexit’s endgame from the government (see [Britain section](https://www.economist.com/news/britain/21744116-prime-minister-concedes-just-enough-avoid-parliamentary-defeats-she-being-driven)). Meanwhile, the penny dropped among Brexiteers that the Irish border presents a near-insurmountable roadblock to a hard exit. With less than six months of negotiating time left, it is becoming clear that Brexit will be softer than Mrs May set out. That is good news for Europe and for Britain.

**U-bend if you want to**

This week’s showdown got the government to promise MPs a “meaningful” vote on the deal Mrs May negotiates with the EU near the end of this year. The assumption had been that a vote to reject Mrs May’s version of Brexit would lead to a drastic “no deal” outcome, in which Britain simply left without covering its financial obligations or establishing its future relationship with the EU. That need no longer happen, because Parliament will now be able to force the government to start again.

That still leaves plenty of room for a hard Brexit. Although the negotiations have laid bare the cost of such a policy, the government has stuck to its demands and red lines. Brexiteers bluster that any problems can be overcome with a bit of positivity and patriotism, or argue that they are a reasonable price to pay for freedom from Brussels. They have persuaded the prime minister that the referendum obliges her to take Britain out of the EU’s single market and customs union at any cost.

But there is one area where Britain cannot opt for maximal separation, however great Mrs May’s appetite for self-harm. Brussels has demanded that in Northern Ireland, for the sake of peace, there must be no new checks or infrastructure at the border. Mrs May agreed to this in December, and has since been seeking a way to reconcile an independent trade policy with an invisible, open border. She has failed—unsurprisingly, since even the EU’s most frictionless frontiers, like those with Norway or Switzerland, involve some checks. So Britain will resort to a “backstop” plan, keeping Northern Ireland in the EU’s customs union until it finds a solution to the border problem, which it may never do. To avoid customs checks between Northern Ireland and the British mainland, which would incense the Northern Irish unionists who prop up Mrs May’s government, the customs union will cover the whole United Kingdom. And it will have no firm time limit.

The softening may not end there. Britain has promised that its Northern Irish backstop will include “full alignment” with the relevant rules of the EU’s single market. Again, Mrs May might find that she has to apply this to the whole country, to avoid a unionist rebellion. Britain would thus find itself in a notionally temporary, but in fact indefinite, arrangement that included membership of the EU’s customs union and full alignment with much of the single market. Soft Brexit would have been achieved, via a backdoor in Belfast.

**Soft, strong and very long**

Though the logic of the negotiations now points to a soft exit, such an outcome is not yet inevitable. Britain’s soft landing outside the EU faces three main risks. The first is that the rest of the EU leaves Ireland in the lurch and drops its demand that the border remain invisible. But EU leaders’ language on the border has if anything been toughening.

The second risk is popular outrage when the EU refuses to give Britain privileged access to the single market unless it allows the free movement of people. If, as seems likely, the EU refuses to dilute this principle, Britain could apply brakes that some member states have already used: registering new migrants, limiting their access to benefits and even excluding them from public-sector jobs. That may be enough to appease some Brexit voters, given that net migration of EU citizens has already fallen more than half since the referendum. Others might be bought off if Mrs May fulfilled other Brexit promises, such as stumping up more money for the health service. And although a hard core would never forgive any softening of Brexit, many more will tune out next March, once Brexit is formally achieved and the blue passports have been issued.

The gravest risk for Mrs May is not the will of the people—polls suggest most Britons favour a soft Brexit. It is the Europhobic wing of her own Tory party. If the prime minister seems to be going soft, her MPs may trigger a leadership challenge. But she might well win such a contest, given the lack of obvious replacements. Even if she fell, her successor would run into the same problem in Northern Ireland. Some Tories complain that the Northern Irish tail is wagging the British dog; they might prefer to see a customs border in the Irish Sea than the wrecking of their hard-Brexit dream. Yet the government’s reliance on unionist votes makes this tail hard to ignore. Would a diehard Brexiteer prime minister risk yet another election, in a bid to win enough seats to ditch the unionists? It would be a reckless gamble that exhausted voters might punish.

The road to a soft Brexit is bumpy. But the remorseless logic of the Irish border is pushing Britain in that direction. And then what? Some Leavers see a soft Brexit as a transition to a complete break. Some Remainers see it as a platform from which to rejoin the EU. Others, from both camps, think that such a semi-detached state is the worst of all worlds. History suggests that Britain might be in for a long stay in transition. Norway, the model cited by many for a soft Brexit, entered a temporary economic arrangement with the EU in 1994.

Macedonian, as many others have noted in the comments, has sentence structure similar to Bulgarian. Although, it has only one definitive article for masculine (in Bulgarian this article is at the end of the word). In Macedonian it's -от (or another variation, but always ending in -т), whereas in Bulgarian we have -ът/-ят and -а/-я, and their use depends on whether the word is the subject in the sentence.

Not one more goddamn 'refugee' from Africa. Syrians are the only ones who should have ever been granted asylum, and even then temporary at best - they should already be on their return flights home at this point. Every single African that insisted they were a refugee should have been turned around *at sea*, and if they refused, sunk and told to swim back or be shot. Every single ""charity"" aiding and abetting this massive human trafficking and invasion should have had their origanisational status as a charity revoked, and any and all employees to jail - ten+ years each for human trafficking, and another ten+ for high treason.

If the centrists and ""reasonable"" politicians will not stand up for Europeans' right to be the beneficiaries of their own taxes, I will gladly join the far right's movement to get it done.

&gt;The man who threatened Metternich and bragged about how he couldn't be stopped because he could spend 30 000 lives a month

That quote is an obvious hyperbole because if he had been taking 30,000 casualties a month he'd be out of soldiers in a year and then lose. The point of the quote is to say that he has more soldiers than Matternich not in the least because French population was homogeneous unlike Austrian where Germans only made up about a third of the population. 

&gt; the regime he usurped was infamous for it's liberal use of guilliotines against whoever it found troublesome that week

Yes as opposed to the glorious republican revolution that saw fit to guillotine whoever Robespierre didn't like that day, or whoever was politically expedient or just an easy mark. The revolution isn't some monolithical event, for much of the period it was a mess culminating in Robespierre's terror. Napoleon brought in order, stopped the mass killings and consolidated the major achievements of the revolution by forming his code napoleon, which is one of the biggest legal achievements in European history. Again, if you want to call him a tyrant you have to look who he was fighting - Austria, Russia and the UK. You cannot call Napoleon the bad guy when his facing opponents such as those. 

&gt;...But building a stable and lasting empire is not something I could see him doing, afterall, the regime he usurped was infamous for it's liberal use of guilliotines against whoever it found troublesome that week. ""What if"" it turned tyrannical? It did.

But you don't need to assume anything, his empire lasted from 1799 to 1814 perfectly well despite near constant state of war from all the major European powers and despite Britain's blockade. There's no reason to assume it would have fallen if you remove the two external factors causing it instability, quite the opposite. 

The revolutions of 1848 were liberal revolutions caused in large part because of the failure of Napoleon and the French revolution, with his victory those revolutions either would have been completely different or wouldn't have happened at all. Even if they agitated for greater independence of German states under France as long as the French made the customs union and economic integration permanent it would have spurned on economic growth and industrialization like never before in Western Europe. Imagine Germany's 1871-1914 economic miracle but also spread across WE with France and Benelux participating. 

&gt;Lol, now who's playing ""what if"" - the spanish sure couldn't integrate them before, the Dutch fought an 80 year war to make sure it didn't happen. What makes you think other parts of Europe wouldn't?

Napoleon's Dutch regime was fairly popular and German regime wasn't the most unpopular regime there either. They might have rebelled but long term, especially without Austria, I think they would have been properly integrated into the empire. Remember this is before the 1848 outbreak of romanticist nationalism and well before Bismarck tied nationalism to blood &amp; soil and made it conservative.

&gt;Yeah, about a century later; in 1918 due to two major factors; It had exhausted all it's resources in a massive continent spanning war(sound familiar?) and little concept of nationalism that I previously mentioned but you disregarded with some what-if story.

Austria would have actually collapsed in 1848 under the Hungarian rebellion (which would have meant independence for Slavs as well) but the Russians intervened and crushed the Hungarians based on the terms of the reactionary alliance Russia, Austria and Bourbon monarchy in France signed after the Congress of Vienna. And once central Austria collapsed the rest could be integrated into French dominated European system, Slovenia and Croatia were already directly annexed into the empire. 

Those are your wonderful, liberating, good guy victors of the wars against Napoleon. And let's not forget Poland who remained oppressed and occupied for another century because of Napoleon's defeat. Let's ask them how much they loved the ""good guy"" victors.

This is true.  The context of migrants in the US is much different than in Europe.

Many Mexican American families became American after the Mexican American War, and still have family south of the border.  A swath of southwest America larger than most European nations used to be part of Mexico.  As much as many Americans would refute it, Mexican culture is a big influence on American culture.  Many many Americans speak Spanish as well (which kind of fucks with the Euro stereo type of Americans being unilingual, but I digress).

Plus Spanish is very easy to learn as you pointed out (not so easy to type on a US keyboard I find).

However we deal with far greater numbers than you do in Europe.  Choose your poison.

The US also emits about twice as much [co2 per capita as any developed European country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_carbon_dioxide_emissions_per_capita#/media/File:CO2_per_capita_per_country.png), moving down from a higher baseline is pretty trivial, and in the US largely a result of the shale revolution. You're celebrating low-hanging fruit here, the US is by far still the worst offender among large industrialised nations. 

Also a large part of the reduction is related to a geographical shift of industry from the US to China, which of course still benefits the US because the US simply became the importer of co2 intensive goods for the purposes of consumption.

&gt;it's been pretty much consensual [...] that the price system
expresses that value in a quantifiable and comparable way like money.

and when I point out that it is an ordered system (IE a ranking [in the mathematical sense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranking), maybe I wasn't clear) you disagree?

sure micro economics has the utility function that act as personal ranking (the fact it change over time doesn't really matter here) but that was not what we were discussing : the price of IPO

If you really want to go to the detail, in macro economic, the demand function is just the agregate of all the utility functions (technically not a weighted average, but the idea is the same)



&gt;&gt;A common example is the private hospital saving 1000 lives and making a profit vs the public hospital saving 2000 with some deficit. Which is the best depend on your political ideology.

&gt;Not really sure of what is that supposed to be an example, but any economist will tell you that's a normative question - the answer obviously depends on each person's worldview.

we seem to agree here, but OP was complaining of people using the metric of profit as the ultimate criteria and your answer was to berate him and say he has ""economic views that have been dead for literally centuries"".  
so which is it? is the view that success is not best measured by profit dead for centuries or does economist agree it depend on the person worldview? you can't change your claim two comment down the line.

-wo is a postfix that means roughly ""noun related to that root, but not the obvious one"".

So:

 - pić = to drink, picie = drinking (noun for the activity of drinking), piwo = the thing you drink

 - krzesać = to strike a flint, krzesanie = the activity of using a flint, krzesiwo = a flint

 - palić= to burn, palenie = activity of burning, paliwo = fuel

 - piec = to bake, pieczenie = activity of baking, pieczywo = baked goods

3047,"&gt; The cabinet doesn’t have to be in the House because it wouldn’t make sense to appoint an elected lawmaker to a ministry.

Although it's usually the case (for political reasons), there is no requirement that ministers have to hold a seat in parliament.

&gt; Like the current minister for defense is a former general

As I recall, he required a special waiver from Congress, because that's not how it's supposed to be. The defence department is supposed to be headed by a *civilian*. And I'm not saying that to trash Mattis; quite the opposite, his qualifications are beyond reproach. All I'm saying is that his appointment to the post is highly unusual and the exception, not the rule.

&gt; You don’t want politicians doing these things because they usually don’t know anything about the ministry area 

That's the reason why most of the decisions of *substance* in our departments are made by federal agencies, which are run by career officials who have expertise in their respective field. Being overseen by political appointees in their respective ministries isn't necessarily a bad thing, because it makes sure that the public has a say in it: ministers can be recalled, policies can be changed and you're not bound to be ruled over by unelected officials running the show behind the curtain.

&gt; That’s why the US has stricter air pollution standards.

3130,"&gt;Not really, since it's a distinction without difference. It's a naturally occurring thing that harms literally nobody. You can't say otherwise.

It does harm humanity in a way though, as they're not going to reproduce. On a smaller level it harms the nation for the same reason. 

&gt;This is definitely not a valid argument. Guess you don't want to see people with Down syndrome, or amputees in public either?

And, you can literally use this exact same argument for being non-white in Russia. Don't want to see an ""abnormal"" (for the region) race after all, right? You shouldn't base your intolerance of something based on appearances.

You do make good points with the down syndrome, but while seeing down people ain't a problem, them drawing attention on themselves through it is. Which is why I hold the same opinion with homosexuality, don't draw attention to. When you're in your 4 walls do what you want, express as much as you like. 

Amputees don't have disorders. I mean my uncle is one, he's all fine, just that he god hit by a grenade. 

Being black though is normal. Yes, it's rare in the region but it's normal. Being gay isn't, cause you can't reproduce through same sex intercourse, which is rather important to humanity.

&gt;I don't understand why giving them equal rights = giving them ""privileges"". Just boggles my mind that you could even make that kind of logical leap. Just treat them the same you would everybody else, because it literally harms no one at all. Literally zero.
There doesn't have to be ""a way"" if you adhered to modern, first world views on marriage equality, but this is an issue because people want it to be one. Gay marriage shouldn't be a privilege, but an inalienable right.

But you're not treating them equally, you're treating them better. As I said, marriage is defined as a union of a man and woman, whether you like it or not, and to have them be able to marry you have to break that definition, something you don't have to for straight people.

And their definition of marriage is just as valid as your's. In no way is your's more correct than their's.

Grabbing a northern norwegian harbour would open up the world oceans to their fleets in a way that they have never been able to do before. Just like how grabbing Gotland would allow them to cover most of europe with missiles and air strikes.

&gt;It's certainly great to see how Europe becomes more important in the tech sector, although I'm struggling with the idea that success is mostly measured by how successful the IPO is and not something like quality or usefulness of the product.

And how exactly do you measure the quality and usefulness of the value? Since Walras and Menger came up with the [subjective theory of value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjective_theory_of_value) in the 1800s, it's been pretty much consensual that individuals voluntarily trading ownership rights over something (in this case, over tech companies) is what reveals that something's value and that the [price system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_system) expresses that value in a quantifiable and comparable way like money.

The IPOs valuation are nothing but an expression of how investors measured the quality and usefulness of what those firms offer to consumers. If you believe investors got it wrong, then it's a great opportunity for you - short or buy stock of those firms you believe to be overvalued/undevalued. 

Theories of intrinsic value were abandoned centuries ago.

3266,"Half of the individual EU countries are more succesful than USA, which is the point. USA already has massive ethnic and political tension, because its so diverse. So half of the EU countries would see a massive downgrade if we became like them. One of them is Finland.



What? Are you mental? You are suggesting that the differences between Finland and its neighboring countries aren't immense, as an argument you say you've travelled alot in EU?

I was born and raised in Finland you fucking doofus. I've been in Sweden 5 times, I've been in Åland, Estonia, Poland, Hungaria and Czech republic. For the love of christ I don't want you to tell me how we're similar to sweden. We're not, and we don't like them. Fucking hell.

You say you've even lived in 2 scandinavian countries, well lucky for you I have a geography lesson for you - Finland isn't part of scandinavia.

Right, okay, what about the political climate of said countries?

Compare Ireland politically to Finland and then Bulgaria. See the similarities? Me neither. Maybe because we're living 3000 kilometers apart from eachother and we have fuck all in common.

USA is a failure of a country when compared to alot of countries, but you fucking missed my point completely.

**They weren't united until they fought a war of independence and a civil war over slavery**

Do you understand how that is not exactly an argument *for* Federal EU?

Oh for fuck sakes. Stop putting words into my mouth. All I said is that ***EU NEEDS TO BE SEEN AS TYRANNICAL FOR FEDERAL EU TO FAIL. AND IT IS ALREADY SEEN AS TYRANNICAL. I DID NOT FUCKING SAY IT IS TYRANNICAL***

Lucky for me, joining a political union and general people supporting it has nothing to do with supporting that institution turning into an federal state. It also applies to things like NATO.

But okay, Catalonia again as an example. They didn't want to be independent because they hate Spain - but because they're richer, and they want to keep that money.

Do you see how this exact same thing would happen in EU? That Denmark doesn't want to pay for Romanias 20 million peoples healthcare expenses, and it would lead to the richer states leaving the union? Involuntary charity - especially when we're talking about potentially over half of your salary, rarely gets a good response from people.

Sure, you could say to Danes that ""you're part of the same group dude, so you're like donating to your neighbors""

And then I ask you to donate half of your salary to the starving people of Senegal and just think they're your neighbors. Just pretend dude. No biggie.

That is absolutely what would happen if EU were to become a country. Mathematically its impossible to have Bulgaria with a gdp per capita of 8000$ and Denmark with 56,000$ under one nation without redistribution of that wealth. One nation cannot have 27 different health care and education systems, they would need a level playing field. If they didn't, everyone would go to Denmark to get an education and healthcare and voilà the system collapses under its own weight.

That is something that I will not be paying for. Neither will Danes, trust me.

In USA this again happens. Richer states like New York pay for states like Mississippi. In this case, Danes are NY and Romania MI.

Not just one swedish person. Nobody in Sweden gave a shit about it. Nobody bat an eye. Nobody raised a noice. Because. Nobody. Fucking. Cared. And they most certainly wouldnt do so under a federal eu either.

3289,"But why did Hitler want to take new ""Lebensraum""? The reason is that Hitler and the Nazis were advocating for something called ""autarky"". They rejected the global trade system in favor of autarky, because the dependence on foreign resources ultimately was the reason for Germanys defeat in World War 1. As the country was blockaded by Britain, the population suffered through scarcity.  Lebensraum was a means to an end for the Nazis, as it would bring resources and population growth.

You have to understand: The defeat in WW1 was THE key event that lead to the rise of Nazi ideology. It was the humiliation that poisoned the mind of the German population after the war.

As for Austria: Hitler hated Austria, because it was a multicultural empire, which in his opinion was the reason for its weakness. So it makes sense that one of his goals was to wipe it off the map, even though it was his homeland.

&gt; They promised a state of things that never existed before. There is no date in history which even remotely fits what the nazis had sketched out. They build up a mythological past but they had no real past to demand to go back to in a reactionary fashion. If you completely make up the past to fit your plans, it's not reactionary.

Sorry, but this definition is wrong. It doesn't matter if a reactionary wants to return to a past system that really existed or something that existed in his mind. What matters are the values that are connected to that fantasy and the rejection of progressive, modernist ideologies, like liberalism and socialism. They used the fantasy of the ""glorious 1000 year Reich"" to justify their policies.

If anything, the Nazis were the most extreme reactionaries possible. Other reactionary faction such as the DNVP merely wanted to restore the old system of the Kaiserreich. But this system already resulted in a failed war and thats why the Nazis rejected it. Their answer: Go back much further, to a time where Germany wasn't ""infected"" by jews and modernist values like liberalism. The other reactionary factions were to moderate for them.

&gt; they weren't idiots, they knew enough about history to be aware that what they proposed never remotely existed.

This doesn't matter, as long as people believed it. Its the same as todays ""Alternative facts"". The Nazis weren't idiots, but they were crazy. Their ideology was contradictory, but to its core the extreme perversion of conservatism and reactionary.

&gt; People make the mistake to lump of fascists and they also make the mistake to lump up far right parties today. Mussolini or Franco you could easily describe as reactionaries but neither started the biggest war in history in an effort to take over perhaps all of Europe. Hitler was in fact not an original fascist but during the 20's he was himself inspired by the tactics Mussolini used (he even tried to replicate Mussolini's march on Rome which got him imprisoned). His end goals and overall ideology however were different.

Fascism and Nazism are two sides of the same coin, with Nazism being even more extreme. Franco on the other hand was merely a moderate reactionary in comparison.

3345,"&gt; Isn't that what you are doing? I give you facts and you chose to ignore it.

Good job ignoring the above points I've made.

What you think will happen isn't a fact, it's you misinterpreting the law because you didn't read it. Read it for yourself before commenting on it.

If you still have criticism about it, then quote the parts that you do not like. Vague claims about what will happen are not part of a healthy discussion.

&gt; If you want to ignore the YouTube example, you can have a look at Google's chilling piracy takedown on what happens when there's no penalty for misfilling.

Google = Youtube. It's the same company.

They currently do ad hoc flagging because there are no rules on how to do it. These new EU rules will force them to treat each case individually in the EU and that's a good thing.

&gt; If you see another way to implement the EU law differently, I'm listening

Reddit has voluntary moderation on every subreddit. Posts that do not follow reddit rules get removed when they are reported for breaking the rules. This is one example of how these new copyright rules can be implemented, via voluntary community moderation on top of what reddit paid moderators do.

The automated filtering mentioned in the new EU law isn't meant to automatically remove content. It's meant to facilitate spotting repeating copyright abuses that would, otherwise, be hard to manually spot due to the sheer volume of posts that sites like reddit get on a daily basis.

The new EU law won't stop people from posting NY Times articles, for example, because almost all news sites have [linking policies](https://help.nytimes.com/hc/en-us/articles/115014893268-Linking) that explicitly allow the sharing of their articles online. This is part of their online business model.

Sites that do not want users to share their content have to explicitly mention this in their legal agreements. There are very few public websites that do not allow linking.

The new EU law mandates that these sites have to prove ownership for their content before requesting a take-down and that each take-down request is to be treated individually.

3367,"&gt;No, there hasn't. Or rather, instead of development of new reactors research funding has been dumped into research of waste management (which is an exaggerated issue to begin with).
&gt;The reactors we adopted were essentially re-purposed military tech, tech not designed for powering our nations. These are the designs that, due to the huge costs of developing reactors, essentially have held back the development of far more promising concepts in terms of safety AND fuel consumption.

Initially, sure. But it didn't work out either after nuclear power was established as civil energy supply, not in the many decades after the establishment of a commercial nuclear industry. If nothing else, it shows how subsidy-dependent nuclear power is to get anything done, while investing in renewables is much easier and within reach of even private individuals and small companies.

&gt;And no, renewables aren't ''just catching up'', they aren't even close and current concepts never will be, at least not for the purposes of bearing the brunt of the workload. 

I meant to say catching up in the total amount of subsidies received. Compare them after total amount is equal.

That being said, renewables already provide more of the world's primary power than nuclear energy.

&gt;As for the space thing again, sending fission powered probes into space will never be done at such a scale that fuel here on Earth will be a problem. 

Nice crystal ball that you have there. Either way, we can always decide to use it later. We cannot decide to get it back.

&gt;And yes, you very much can think of it as a Civ game. Stocking up on an infinite amount of vellum in the middle ages to keep an infinite historical record wasn't a good idea then and such ideas won't be a good idea now. We can reasonably expect that new advancements will be made in a century or two's time.

Vellum is a renewable resource, of course it doesn't make sense to stock up. And no, we can by definition not predict fundamental research breakthroughs. What we can predict is incremental improvements in existing technology, the benefits of mass production etc. So there is a predictable improvement in renewables coming up, but we cannot predict fundamental breakthroughs in Fusion power or the golden idea that makes breeders or thorium reactors possible for commercial use.",Limburg,/r/europe/comments/8qpkgv/a_measure_of_progress_eu_greenhouse_gas_emissions/e0ploj8/,silverionmox,1529061694

It very much is not, unless you take the Spanish view. Declaration of Independence is the correct date, legal or otherwise. 

Besides which, even if you take the Spanish view, it is absurd to say that a country only truly became independent when its former lord recognized it, despite the country having been fully treated by the rest of the world as an independent country for almost 40 years, became a Great Power in that time, and having acted as an independent country for even longer than that.

3429,"The reaction from Russia is expected. Norway has refused permanently stationed foreign troops since WW2 to keep tension with USSR/Russia as low as possible.

However, the annexation of Crimea changed that, from a Norwegian perspective. The Norwegian goverment fear a similar annexation of Finnmark. Even though such a scenario is still unlikely, it is still the most probable threat to Norwegian sovereignty. An annexation of Finnmark should most definitley trigged Art. 5 in NATO. But with all the shifts and upsets in global politics, who knows. And bigger suprises has happened before.

Norwegian policy is therefore to remove *any* doubt that the other NATO countries would have to intervene. Norway is moving and building up its forces in the north. This ensures that Russia can't do a Crimea-like ""peaceful"" invasion, and Russia would have to commit a lot of troops in Norway, with a prolonged conflict as a result. It is hard to not abide by Art. 5 if another ally is in an active an prolonged conflict with a foreign invader. 

This is also why Norway in 2016 for the first time since WW2 accepted a permanent presence of foreign troops. U.S. troops in Norway would further deter an annexation in the north.

3442,"&gt;The national grid will collapse if they shutdown the rest of nuclear plants as planned by early 2020's.

No it won't. Right now Germany has 10.8 GW of nuclear power production capacity.

Power production capacity of fossil fuel (lignite, hard coal, natural gas, mineral oil) is a combined 80.3 GW.

Renewable power production capacity is 112,2GW, though obviously not all the capacity is available at the same time. 

But which parts of those 112,2GW are dependable?
5.6GW of hydro energy, 7.4GW of biomass. Combined more than our nuclear power plants can produce.

&gt; Now that's just silly. Hitler waged war and killed millions, Apple just choose to keep their source code proprietary and don't allow everything on their store.

Because it's Holocausterer.

&gt; Which is precisely why they aren't used -- that isn't Microsoft's fault they make the better software, they've spent billions in R&amp;D, updating the Kernel, APIs and other infrastructure to get Windows where it is today, same with Google and Apple.

The point is that they should be built up to a usable state. Your point seems to be that they're not used because they are not sufficiently as of yet in at a usable state. Are we discussing completely different topics? It seems so.

Think for a moment about the logic of the context. Someone writes that the EU should build its own Linux OS, likely implying it as an alternative to Microsoft. A Microsoft bootlicker defends them with some rather pathetic excuses, and I then I mock them and imply valid reasons for why there is a cause for such a project. Then you come in and enlighten us all that the reason governments use Microsoft is because it's currently the only viable option. Thanks.

&gt; The reason why a lot of these open-source applications aren't mainstream is because they put ideology before practicality.

It's probably because there's no money in it.

&gt; Take Handbrake for example

I'm not familiar with the case of Handbrake, but if they want to build something that is 100% open source, then of course they're not going to implement things that are not open source. You deride this as 'ideology before practicallity', but I'm guessing that's kinda the point. We can see this as yet another example of how hard it is to do things purely through open source. You can conclude that they should just sacrifice their principles, but I'd rather conclude that there is merit to supporting such principles strategically.

&gt; Society is more connected that it has ever been before, to connect societies even more, you'd have to start sacrificing even more privacy if you want societies more connected.

I'm referring to things like smart cities and smart factories. What we have right now are normies and dorks playing around with putting internet in toasters.

In Denmark, this directive has resulted in plans for that **include** EU roaming and plans that don't, i.e. instead of paying for roaming on a per use basis, some people now pay a flat rate for some X GB of roaming allowed per month.

3557,"&gt; Well, brand ownership is zero-sum. Either Italy gets a monopoly over it and shifts money from Canadian consumers to Italian producers or it doesn't. That's deciding where $N goes.

It would be, if you assume that the consumption remains constant.

I've compared some specifications for cheeses between the EU and US regulations that define what a specific cheese (e.g., Parmesan) is. You have traditional raw-milk cheeses made from pasteurized milk, and allow additives for texture, color or taste when there aren't supposed to be any in there. They're not the same cheeses, at all.  

Those regulations aren't there to (only) protect the producers from a region that traditionally produces a certain product from outside competition. They're usually carefully written by the local producers' associations to also protect their shared brand against sub-standard producers from within the local community. It's not enough to produce something in a certain place, you also have to adhere to some pretty strict standards. 

Without this protection, consumers who believe they have tried a certain product, but really had a sub-standard imitation, write it off as nothing special and buy something else instead next time. You're also putting the traditional producers whose ancestors have built the brand at a competitive disadvantage *for their own product* by allowing competitors to use a cheaper method of production that they themselves aren't allowed to use, all while damaging their brand.

(That said, though, I still believe that CETA should pass. I just wanted to clarify that this isn't zero-sum, and not a simple case of regional producers trying to protect a monopoly.)

Do we want technofeudalism by Silicon Valley type Libertarians, or do we want something else, like a world where citizens can freely inspect the transparant configurations of public services, where authorities are adaptable and decentralised? To get a sense of the politics I'm referring to, I ask you to [listen to this long-ass speech.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYW3jBKg-3k)

3586,"Polling has gotten worse and worse since we last voted. The last referendum got pretty close 52.2/47.8 against joining. Current polling puts the no side at 66%. 

There are many reasons for this, but here are some of them, in no particular order; 

(1) - We're on the periphery. We're located on the edges of Europe and whatever happens in the center of the continent (sout-north wise) feels somewhat far away and distant. 

(2) - Central power. Norway is centralized on a political level, and regions and municipalities have little political leeway in terms of taxation and rule-making. Regions and municipalities have some rights to set local taxes and regulations, but the vast majority is centrally controlled, that means adding another layer on top of what we already have unknown to us, as opposed to other countries that have a more federal system. This might change somewhat with the new regional reform we're going through, where we are creating fewer and larger regions. These will probably get some more power and political clout than the regions we have today, though no changes will be made to the constitution to move any powers down to regional level. 

(3) - Foreign political system. On a national level most politicians prefer to reach large and important decisions by getting most if not all parties on board. Care is taking to ensure that everyone involved gets atleast one victory they can show for to their voters. Changes to taxation, pension schemes and other important and long term, especially fiscal matters, are usually done by getting most of the parties on board. This ensures continuity and that we don't flip-flop whenever we get a new government. The EU looks much more catothic and cut-throat from afar than our system. The level of lobbying and backroom deals makes the system seems corrupt and alien compared to what we're used to.

(4) - ""Union"". Norway has been in a Union at least two times in our history. First the Kalmar Union and secondly in a union as a minority partner under Sweden. We don't remember those times very fondly. We only regained sovereignty a little over a hundred years ago (1905), and it was a long processes that has shaped our identity and the way we view ourselves. Entering another union, where we yet again will be marginalized is a hard sell given our history.

(5) - The economy. We're obviously doing quite well, so there's no pressing need for us to join due to economical or financial reasons. Our main export is oil and gas, and our currency moves according to the price of those two commodities. This allows the currency to fall during periods of low oil/gas prices and rice in periods of high prices. Joining the EU would mean taking on the Euro, which removes the direct correlation between oil/gas prices and the currency level. During the last oil price dip, our currency devalued quickly and made our other exports more viable. Adopting the Euro would've meant that we got hit by reduction in oil and gas income and a currency that would keep its strength and not help facilitate exports.

There are other reasons, and people may not agree with what I've written, but I do believe that these are some of the reasons.

Secondly, there is not enough political pressure on either side to change the status quo. The parties that want to ditch the EEA and replace it with a FTA has been growing for the last few years, but the biggest parties in both blocks (Conservative and Labour) both effectively kill off any idea that the EEA is to be changed as soon as the coalition talks begin. 

The pro-EU side is shutting up about the prospects of us joining since it's obviously not very popular, and they fear that any discussion of EU membership will turn into a discussion on continuing the EEA deal. The anti-EU/EEA side is too small to force anything through right now, but things may change, especially on the left, if Labour keeps slipping in the polls and ends up having to make concessions to the other parties in the block, who all want to ditch the EEA or at least renegotiate it.

TLDR; Nobody is very happy with the current situation, but there's not enough political will or power on either side to move is in any direction, towards or away from the EU.  ",Norway,/r/europe/comments/8qr38u/eu_expected_to_pass_censorship_machines_link_tax/e0pf6mm/,skylark78,1529048200

Kaspersky Antivirus accused of creating fake malware for over 10 years

https://thenextweb.com/insider/2015/08/14/kaspersky-antivirus-accused-of-creating-malware-for-over-10-years/

But at the same time they are transferring their servers to Switzerland and hiring a 3rd party for audits, so dunno.

&gt;On 25 October 2017, Kaspersky confirmed that the incident described by The Wall Street Journal had occurred in 2014, and was the result of the software having detected a ZIP file containing samples and source code from the Equation Group. The user had enabled the Kaspersky Security Network (KSN) features of the software, so the files were automatically uploaded as a malware sample to KSN for analysis, under the assumption that it was a new malware variant. Eugene Kaspersky stated that he ordered that the sample be destroyed. Kaspersky claimed that the antivirus software had been temporarily disabled by the PC's user in order to install a pirated copy of Microsoft Office. When the software was re-enabled, it detected both the Equation Group code, as well as unrelated backdoor infections created by a keygen program for Office, which may have facilitated third-party access to the computer

&gt;On 6 October 2017, The Wall Street Journal—citing ""multiple people with knowledge of the matter""—alleged that in 2015, hackers working for the Russian government used Kaspersky antivirus software to steal classified material from a home computer belonging to a National Security Agency (NSA) contractor. According to the report, the incident occurred in 2015 and remained undiscovered until early 2016. The stolen material reportedly included ""details about how the NSA penetrates foreign computer networks, the computer code it uses for such spying and how it defends networks inside the U.S.""[132] The New York Times reported that the hacks had been discovered by Israeli intelligence agents who had themselves hacked into Kaspersky's network.[133] On 11 October 2017, The Wall Street Journal additionally alleged that Russian intelligence uses Kaspersky software to scan computers worldwide for material of interest.

&gt;On 8 September 2017, U.S. electronics store chain Best Buy pulled Kaspersky products amid concerns over these ties.[130] On 13 September 2017, the Department of Homeland Security issued an order stating that in 90 days Kaspersky products will be banned from use within the U.S. civilian federal government, citing ""[concerns] about the ties between certain Kaspersky officials and Russian intelligence and other government agencies, and requirements under Russian law that allow Russian intelligence agencies to request or compel assistance from Kaspersky and to intercept communications transiting Russian networks.""

&gt;In August 2015, Bloomberg News reported that Kaspersky Lab changed course in 2012, as ""high-level managers have left or been fired, their jobs often filled by people with closer ties to Russia’s military or intelligence services. Some of these people actively aid criminal investigations by the FSB, the KGB’s successor, using data from some of the 400 million customers""

&gt;On 15 May 2018, Kaspersky Lab announced that it would be migrating its ""core infrastructure"" from Russia to new data centres in Switzerland. Kaspersky software and antivirus definitions for international markets will be compiled and digitally signed in Switzerland by the end of 2018 (products targeting Russia will still be compiled on existing domestic infrastructure), and user data for most international markets will be stored and processed on Swiss servers by the end of 2019. The Swiss operations will be overseen by a third-party organization holding ""all access necessary to verify the trustworthiness of our products and business processes"", and will be accompanied by one of the three planned ""Transparency Centre"" facilities, where ""responsible stakeholders"" will be allowed to inspect Kaspersky's source code and business practices to verify their integrity. Kaspersky stated that this move was ""first and foremost in response to the evolving, ultra-connected global landscape and the challenges the cyber-world is currently facing"", and was a further step in its goal to be more accountable and trustworthy in its business practices.",Bulgaria,/r/europe/comments/8r1zvc/european_lawmakers_vote_to_ban_kaspersky_lab/e0p5398/,wintervenom123,1529032792

Like, if you have 5 parties in parliament, the governing coalition will make an agreement about what legislation to pass.

The actual policies that get implemented have more to do with internal party haggling between the leadership of parties more than actual votes.

3728,"&gt; I understand you argument; but people who argue what you're arguing, are really thinking in terms of last decade's grids, and ignoring completely how smart grids will continue to evolve moving forward.

Yeah, and my point is that we could save money by not having to upgrade.

I'm not saying that's necessarily a good thing, but spending money on a grid means spending less money on other CO2 reduction initiatives.

So the cost of renewable isn't the solar panel, or the windmill. It's the grid + solar panel + storage + extra cost of having backup energy. It's about being realistic, nothing more.

&gt;Leave aside grid-scale storage options (which are being researched, and even in its most prozaic forms are showing massive success like Tesla's setup in southern Australia); you're ignoring how low-priority appliances will communicate with the grid to regulate demand in accordance with production. You're ignoring the incoming fleets of electric cars, which not too far from now will start implementing load-balancing and even downright storage in exchange for rebates in energy with vehicle2grid technology.

I'm not ignoring any of that. Every single thing you mentioned is a cost additive, not a subtraction.

You're talking about giving people rebates to allow the power suppliers to use their cars as batteries. Those rebates must be paid for, and that adds additional costs. So whether you spend the money directly, or indirectly, it's still a cost you have to factor into it.

&gt;I'm unsure about the predictions you speak of, but some (geographically advantaged, admittedly) countries are already at next to 100% wind and solar all of the time.

Which countries are they?

I'm from Denmark and we had the world record in wind energy recently. That was just around 50% of the electricity we produced, so I'm not sure where you're getting 100%

It's hard comparing a poor nation with no industry &amp; low standard of living to a fully developed society.

&gt;The level of penetrance of these sources of energies today have surpassed all the predictions that were made even 5 years ago.

No they didn't? In fact most of the optimistic predictions are well below the expectation, especially in places like the USA, Australia, Spain, Italy, and other nations that have been ideal candidates for solar &amp; wind.

The predictions are pretty spot on - as they have been with global warming. Sure they aren't 100%, but they are well within the margin of error, and they have been for the past 20 years.

The most optimistic predictions put us at 50% renewable in 2050. That's 32 years, and in those 32 years we are going from ~20% to 50%.",,/r/europe/comments/8qzx3i/eu_strikes_deal_on_32_renewable_energy_target_and/e0p5rg3/,upvotesthenrages,1529033605

3749,"&gt; Power was taken by force from the elected parliament, with the chairman of the city of Grozny being murdered.

TIL KGB and Supreme Soviet were elected parlaiment. Those were Moscow installed oppressors and colonial suppressors.

&gt; When the parliament objected too much, it was dissolved.

That have happened when the Russian backed opposition tried to take over, and started a civil war after the failed coup attempt of theirs.

&gt; But only in Chechnya did they take complete control and turned the whole republic into a base for attacks on the surrounding regions.

No such a thing, again, I don't know where do you get such ideas. Russian daily newspapers?

&gt; Chechnya did not have the right to declare independence, so obviously Russia had to do something.

Chechnya had right to declare independence based on the first Soviet constituon. Chechnya also had right to declare independence just as Bulgaria did, and actually more since unlike Bulgarians, they've faced genocide by the colonial masters of theirs. If you're with that mindset though, you're free to support a campaign for your country to be part of Turkey. 

&gt; Yet they still waited for three years 

By waited you mean tried to have a Eastern Ukraine scénario in the Northern Chechnya, tried a coup and a civil war? Sure.

&gt; But your claim about Russia having to invade or others would have followed is false.

Russia invaded Chechnya because Russia tried to invade North Caucasus from 18th century to late 19th century. You don't have to look far to see Russians also having fears about other regions also leaving and the RF also breaking away just like the USSR.

&gt; It's only the Chechens who refused any agreement, because it would have interfered with their little bandit republic.

Pal, that's low. Especially for some country that gained its independence from an imperial master. Don't worry though, I also feel ashamed for you.

&gt; Tatarstan in fact only declared sovereignty, which is not the same as independence and in any case they reached an agreement with the Russian federal government

In 1992 referandum, majority favoured the independence. Then the Tatar elite worked with the Moscow behind the doors though, and they have reached an agreement 10 years later. With Chechnya gone, sure Tatarstan and related Tatar ethnicities would be gone too.

&gt; And the reason they did this is because the situation with Chechnya was becoming unendurable.

By unendurable, if you mean Chechnya becoming independent and them not being able to annex them back, true...

&gt; So you're denying that Chechen society is clannish, with frequent conflicts between the clans? How can you expect to be taken seriously when you deny well known information?

Clans have nothing to do with the civil war or the independence movement. Whole North Caucasus have clans, as well as Albanians, and their movements also have no relation to clans or whatever. 

&gt; What you are describing is mostly the Ottoman lands in this period.

I'm describing where the Circassian settlements were in Balkans.

&gt; And Serbia was already independent, so they couldn't have settled Circassians there.

Not the all current Serbia. That's why you had and to some point still have Circassians villages in Kosovo and parts of Serbia. Believe me, half of my family were Kosovar Circassians.

&gt; Again, you should read the source (page 147). The Circassians were  often raiders before being expelled from their homeland and continued doing the same in their settlements.

Mate, it's my nation, thank you but I do know better than you what my nation is. Most of the Circassians that have been settled in Bulgaria were democratic tribes which outlawed raids. What have happened was them robbing since they were starving. They did the same in Anatolia as well, and even with that, for the first 5 years, they continued to die.

&gt; There were no uprisings in Bulgaria in 1867 or 1868. There were some rebel bands which crossed from Romania, but they were defeated by the regular Ottoman army.

Circassians volunteered to be the militia during the 1867-1869 since the rebellions. Don't know what have happened that year, but that militia was disbanded in the '69, when the rebellions was over.

&gt; I am denying your claim that no one was settled on foreign territory.

I haven't claimed such a thing. I've said, they were settled in the territories that were owned by the Sultan. Some lands were taken away by the Sultan for settling Tatars and Circassians as well, but no land was taken by neither of them but by the Sultan, and what they've seen was Sultan giving his lands to them.

&gt; The Ottoman oppression did not start in 1876. You can rather say that the uprising were due to the long history of oppression. And the Bulgarians were not backed by Russia. The rebels were advised against starting an uprising by Russia.

That's not what Circassians have perceived at least. That's why Circassians haven't done anything towards Greeks during the Greek uprisings or Albanians or anyone. There were even some plans about Russians and Ottomans having a population exchange between Bulgarians and Circassians, and they lives in the collective memory as well. You've been perceived as Russian backed people and also a different flavour of Russians. Nobody is saying what Circassians have done was correct, and sure if there can be an independent Circassian body, we should be apologising for what we've done to Bulgarians when they wanted their independence but I'm pointing out the reasons.

&gt; And not all Circassians were enforcers but those settled by the Ottomans in Christian lands certainly were..

You're aware that Ukrainian Cossacks and Terek Cossacks are different people, right? There is the reason why Chechens do have tensions with the Terek Cossacks since they were butchers and colonisers, and exist for that purpose. Pretty much different than some Circassians enlisted into some militia.

Also, many Circassians who have settled in Bulgaria have became a weapon for the Ottomans, true but not ""in the Christian lands"". Again, no such a thing in the rest of the Balkans. Things were limited to ones backed by the Russians, or at least perceived as that, meaning only Bulgarians in the Balkans.

&gt; Several villages were certainly entirely or almost entirely exterminated. And you were certainly justifying by claiming that they were ""komita villages""

Nobody is justifying anything, I'm pointing out the reason. What have done was wrong.

**Arrian, Ancient Greek Historian, The Campaigns of Alexander**
&gt;“He also buried the Persian commanders and the Greek mercenaries who were killed fighting on the side of the enemy. But as many of them as he took prisoners he bound in fetters and sent them away to Macedonia to till the soil, because, though they were Greeks, they were fighting against Greece on behalf of the foreigners in opposition to the decrees which the Greeks had made in their federal council. To Athens also he sent 300 suits of Persian armour to be hung up in the Acropolis as a votive offering to Athena, and ordered this inscription to be fixed over them: Alexander, son of Philip and all the Greeks except the Lacedaemonians, present this offering from the spoils taken from the barbarians inhabiting Asia.”
(Arrian, “Anabasis Alexandri”, 1.16.7, http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0530%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D16%3Asection%3D7 )

&gt;""Your ancestors came to Macedonia and the rest of Greece and did us great harm, though we had done them no prior injury. I have been appointed leader of the Greeks, and wanting to punish the Persians I have come to Asia, which I took from you.""
(Alexander's letter to Persian king Darius in response to a truce plea, as quoted in ""Anabasis Alexandri"" by Roman historian Arrian, Book 2.14.4 http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Arr.+An.+2.14.4&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0530

&gt;Alexander the Great, king of Macedon, 356 BCE - 323 BCE:
""There are Greek troops, to be sure, in Persian service — but how different is their cause from ours! They will be fighting for pay — and not much of at that; we, on the contrary, shall fight for Greece, and our hearts will be in it.""
(Alexander addressing his troops prior to the Battle of Issus, as quoted in Anabasis Alexandri by Roman historian Arrian, 2. 7.4, http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0530%3Abook%3D2%3Achapter%3D7%3Asection%3D4

**Plutarch, Ancient Greek Historian, The Age of Alexander**
&gt;“He was particularly afraid of Antipater and of his sons, one of whom, Iolas, was his chief cupbearer; the other, Cassander, had only recently come to Babylon, and when he saw some barbarians doing obeisance to Alexander, since he had been reared as a Greek and had never seen such a sight as this before, he laughed boisterously.”
(Plutarch, “Alexander”, 74 http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0243:chapter=74&amp;highlight=greek)

&gt;“O wondrous power of Philosophic Instruction, that brought the Indians to worship Greek gods, and the Scythians to bury their dead, not to devour them! We admire Carneades' power, which made Cleitomachus, formerly called Hasdrubal, and a Carthaginian by birth, adopt Greek ways ... But when Alexander was civilizing Asia, Homer was commonly read, and the children of the Persians, of the Susianians, and of the Gedrosians learned to chant the tragedies of Sophocles and Euripides. Yet through Alexander Bactria and the Caucasus learned to revere the gods of the Greeks [...] Alexander established more than seventy cities among savage tribes, and sowed all Asia with Greek magistracies [...] Egypt would not have its Alexandria, nor Mesopotamia its Seleucia, nor Sogdiana its Prophthasia, nor India its Bucephalia, nor the Caucasus a Greek city, for by the founding of cities in these places savagery was extinguished and the worse element, gaining familiarity with the better, changed under its influence.”
(Plutarch, ""Moralia: On the Fortune of Alexander"", I, 328d, 329a)

&gt;“But when he (Alexander) came to talk with Diogenes  himself in Corinth, he was so awed and astounded with the life and the worth of the man that often, when remembrance of the philosopher came to him, he would say, ‘If I were not Alexander,I should be Diogenes,’ that is to say: ‘If I did not actively practise philosophy, I should apply myself to its theoretical pursuit.’ He did not say, ‘If I were not a king, I should be Diogenes,’ nor ‘If I were not rich and an Argead’ ; for he did not rank Fortune above Wisdom, nor a crown and royal purple above the philosopher's wallet and threadbare gown. But he said, ‘If I were not Alexander, I should be Diogenes’; that is to say: ‘If it were not my purpose to combine foreign things with things Greek, to traverse and civilize every continent, to search out the uttermost parts of land and sea, to push the bounds of Macedonia to the farthest Ocean, and to disseminate and shower the blessings of Greek justice and peace over every nation, I should not be content to sit quietly in the luxury of idle power, but I should emulate the frugality of Diogenes.
But as things are, forgive me, Diogenes, that I imitate Heracles, and emulate Perseus, and follow in the footsteps of Dionysus, the divine author and progenitor of my family, and desire that victorious Greeks should dance again in India and revive the memory of the Bacchic revels among the savage mountain tribes beyond the Caucasus. Even there it is said that there are certain holy men, a law unto themselves, who follow a rigid gymnosophy and give all their time to God ; they are more frugal than Diogenes since they have no need of a wallet. For they do not store up food, since they have it ever fresh and green from the earth; the flowing rivers give them drink and they have fallen leaves and grassy earth to lie upon. Because of me even those faraway sages shall come to know of Diogenes, and he of them. And I also, like Diogenes, must alter the standard of coinage and stamp foreign states with the impress of Greek government.’
(Plutarch, ""Moralia: On the Fortune of Alexander"" [De Alexandri magni fortuna aut virtute], 1.10., http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0231%3Achapter%3D1%3Asection%3D10)

&gt;""This boy is a ‘great king’; our king is only wealthy.’ But after Philip's end, when Alexander was eager to cross over and, already absorbed in his hopes and preparations, was hastening to gain a hold upon Asia, Fortune, seizing upon him, blocked his way, turned him about, dragged him back, and surrounded him with countless distractions and delays. First she threw into the utmost commotion the barbarian elements among his neighbours, and contrived wars with the Illyrians and Triballians. By these wars he was drawn from his Asiatic projects as far away as the portion of Scythia that lies along [p. 473] the Danube ; when, by sundry manoeuvres, he had subjugated all this territory with much danger and great struggles, he was again eager and in haste for the crossing. Again, however, Fortune stirred up Thebes against him, and thrust in his pathway a war with Greeks, and the dread necessity of punishing, by means of slaughter and fire and sword, men that were his *kith and kin*, a necessity which had a most unpleasant ending."" http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0231%3Achapter%3D2%3Asection%3D11

**Diodorus Siculus, Ancient Greek Historian**
&gt;“Then he (Alexander) called a meeting at Corinth of envoys and delegates, and when the usual representatives came, he spoke to them in moderate terms and had them pass a resolution appointing him general plenipotentiary of the Greeks and undertaking themselves to join in an expedition against Persia seeking satisfaction for the offences which the Persians had committed against Greece. Successful in this, the king returned to Macedonia with his army.”
(Diodorus Siculus, ""Histories"", 17.4.9)

&gt;“Such was the end of Philip … He had ruled 24 years. He is known to fame as one who with but the slenderest resources to support his claim to a throne won for himself the greatest empire among the Hellenes, while the growth of his position was not due so much to his prowess in arms as to his adroitness and cordiality in diplomacy.”
(Diodoros of Sicily 16.95.1-2)

&gt;“First he (Alexander) dealt with the Thessalians, reminding them of his ancient relationship to them through Heracles”

**Quintus Curtius Rufus, Roman Historian**
&gt;They recalled that at the start of his reign Darius had issued orders for the shape of the scabbard of the Persian scimitar to be altered to the shape used by the Greeks, and that the Chaldeans had immediately interpreted this as meaning that rule over the Persians would pass to those people whose arms Darius had copied. “
(Quintus Curtius Rufus 3.3.6)

&gt;Mutiny was but a step away when, unperturbed by all this, Alexander summoned a full meeting of his generals and officers in his tent and ordered the Egyptian seers to give their opinion. They were well aware that the annual cycle follows a pattern of changes, that the moon is eclipsed when it passes behind the earth or is blocked by the sun, but they did not give this explanation, which they themselves knew, to the common soldiers. Instead, they declared that the sun represented the Greeks and the moon the Persians, and that an eclipse of the moon predicted disaster and slaughter for those nations.”
(Quintus Curtius Rufus 4.10.6)

&gt;As for Alexander, it is generally agreed that, when sleep had brought him back to his senses after his drunken bout, he regretted his actions and said that the Persians would have suffered a more grievous punishment at the hands of the Greeks had they been forced to see him on Xerxes’ throne and in his palace.”
(Quintus Curtius Rufus 5.7.11)


As for Justin. Macedon as a kingdom did expand and conquer the Greek City States and as stated earlier while they where Hellenes they where still there own entity/group which many believe derived from the Dorians ((Which is also where the Spartans believed they derived from)). I think archaeological evidence such as the Pella Curse Tablet, local coins and other carvings along with the many statements from historians is enough to show that Macedonians where Greeks or a people that where heavily related/connected to them. Therefore the Greek side of the argument does have more of a basis then the FYROM one.

Granted while I do disagree with some of his points I think users Iphikrates answer of Macedonians being Greek is a fair conclusion to take as well.
https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4wsix2/was_alexander_the_great_greek/

Also hundreds of Historians, Archaeologist, Professors etc across the world also think that Macedonia was more of a part of Greek History then it was FYROM does also say a lot.

Let's assume we're not going full pie in the sky and only banning personal cars. Transport infrastructure better fucking be up to snuff.

If someone straight asked for LGBT material the response would be the same as I said. The company does not support the LGBT movement, not that the people who asked are gay.

You can never look at the person when making the decision otherwise you do fall under discrimination. 

Now onto my own example. It comes down to the fact internet is a utility like electricity or water. There are a special set of rules for ISPs because using the regular logic they would have the right to ban certain sites since they own the wires and the consumer is just renting the bandwidth, but that'd be too much power for a company in the same way the electric and water companies can never deny a customer.

What I particularly like about first-past-the-post is that one usually ends up with a clear majority and a clear mandate to govern. Voters decide who governs and who takes a seat on the opposition benches.

With a proportional system, voters decide who represents them, not necessarily who governs. Voters get the chance to ""fine-tune"" policy on the issues, because they have a wider variety of parties to chose from, which in turn have a real shot at ending up governing, either on their own or by way of entering coalitions.

A striking feature of proportional representation is higher turnout, which makes sense because fewer votes are discarded.

3909,"&gt;In it’s more aggressive forms, Republicanism is undeniably a radical militant nationalist ideology that glorifies struggle; loves romanticism; and prefers violence and mobilization of the sovereign collective will to what it regards as sterile, deracinated, and ineffective  political debate

You could say the same about the US and France. We both glorify the struggle in the anti-monarchy American/French revolutions, have romantic ideas about liberty than we mythmake for ourselves, and like the ""idea"" of manly violence and mobilization over debate (at least when it comes to independence/killing the monarchy. 

I think that Republicanism in Ireland just sort of comes off radical and militant because it has to because Ireland is smaller. Historically, Ireland couldn't just raise a normal army against the much larger UK and fight a conventional war, so Irish Republicanism has had to manifest itself in a more guerilla way. 

But like if Ireland had a much larger population and the IRA had defeated the British in normal full scale battles, then it would have been been pretty much the same type of mythmaking that France and the US have today. And you would never call that type of conventional republicanism fascist. ",,/r/europe/comments/8r561e/end_for_merkel_power_struggle_with_minister/e0os68x/,sandyhands2,1529018263

3914,"&gt; Nazis didn’t consider themselves reactionary

No one said that Nazism was a coherent ideology. In fact, internal contradictions are a key feature of it. Thats why the term [""reactionary modernism""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactionary_modernism) exists.

Of course, the Nazis tried to distinguish them self from other reactionary factions such as the royalist DNVP. After all, they didn't wanted to have a Kaiser in power, they wanted the power. That doesn't change that they idolized the German past and mythology as much as possible and wanted to ""return the Nation to glory"".

You can deny it, but Nazism is the most extreme reactionary ideology there is. Even more extreme than Mussolinis Fascism, which just kinda aimed to restore the Roman Empire. The Nazis wanted to return to a glory time of Germany that didn't even exist.

What acts as a unifying force are culture and a common cause. Language is just a part of culture, and one that develops, evolves and changes *due* to it as well as due to external influences (which we can witness again right now with the many English words that have found their way into everyday use of other languages).

Yugoslavia and the USSR didn't fall apart because of language. With ethnicity you are closer (and moving the goalpost), but as history shows, a common national identity transcends either. And this national identity can just as well be the European Union. The countries we are today have *themselves* not started out as such, too, but consisted of different and in many cases warring smaller states, which in turn emerged out of *even smaller* ones, all the way back to the point where our ancestors lived in tribes of a few hundred individuals or less.

I didn't say that. I said that the market of the ~250 PDO/PGI labels not already covered by CETA is minor/almost nonexistent outside Italy. And it most definitely is. 

&gt;I think 20 years of Berlusconi and his general disaffection for european politics have lulled non-italians into this feeling that we are entitled to safeguard our interests. We have those too, you know. Just because they haven't been voiced for two decades, it doesn't mean they're not there.

No one is denying your right to stand up to your own interests. The issue that the time to do that, the negotiation phase, was between 2011 and 2014.

CETA is in its 11th year of discussion and you do this right at the finish line.

&gt;""When received the report that Alexander was moving forward to the attack, he sent some 30,000 mounted troops and 20,000 light infantry across the river Pinarus, to give himself a chance of getting the main body of his army into position without molestation. His dispositions were as follows:

&gt;in the van of his heavy infantry were his 30,000 Greek mercenaries, facing the Macedonian infantry, with some 60,000 Persian heavy infantry- known as Kardakes."" [p.114]

---

&gt; [Book II - Battle of Issus] ""Darius' Greeks fought to thrust the Macedonians back into the water and save the day for their left wing, already in retreat, while the Macedonians, in their turn, with Alexander's triumph plain before their eyes, were determined to equal his success and not forfeit the proud title of invincible, hitherto universally bestowed upon them. The fight was further embittered by the old racial rivalry of Greek and Macedonian."" [p.119]

---

&gt; ""The same painstaking attention to details is evident in administrative matters. Appointments of governors are duly mentioned, and throughout his book Arrian is careful to give the father's name in the case of Macedonians, e.g. Ptolemy son of Lagus, and in the case of Greeks their city of origin."" [p.25]

----

A record of a speech given by Alexander to his troops.

&gt; ""Come, then; add the rest of Asia to what you already possess - a small addition to the great sum of your conquests. What great or noble work could we ourselves have achieved had we thought it enough, living at ease in Macedon, merely to guard our homes, excepting no burden beyond checking the encroachment of the Thracians on our borders, or the Illyrians and Triballians, or perhaps such Greeks as might prove a menace to our comfort."" [p.294]

**Plutarch, Ancient Greek Historian**, *The Age of Alexander*

&gt; Alexander was only twenty years old when he inherited his kingdom, which at the moment was beset by formidable jealousies and feuds, and external dangers on every side. The neighbouring barbarian tribes were eager to throw off the Macedonian yoke and longed for the rule of their native kings: As for the Greek states, although Philip had defeated them in battle, he had not had time to subdue them or accustomed them to his authority. Alexander's Macedonian advisers feared that a crisis was at hand and urged the young king to leave the Greek states to their own devices and refrain from using any force against them. [p.263]

----
&gt; Alexander asks a woman, who was being taken captive, who she was, she replied: 'I am the sister of Theogenes who commanded our army against your father, Philip, and fell at Chaeronea fighting for the liberty of Greece.' [p.265]

---
&gt; ""While Demosthenes was still in exile, Alexander died in Babylon, and the Greek states combined yet again to form a league against Macedon. Demosthenes attached himself to the Athenian convoys, and threw all his energies into helping them incite the various states to attack the Macedonians and drive them out of Greece."" [p.212]

---
&gt; ""The maladies and defects in the Greek scene of the fourth century were not hard to find. But its great and overriding merit is summed up in the word 'freedom.' With allowance made for the infinite variety promoted by so many independent governments, Greece was still broadly speaking a free country. This freedom was threatened and in the end extinguished by the coming of the great Macedonians."" [p.8]

**Diodorus Siculus, 
Ancient Greek Historian**

&gt; For many days the king lay helpless under his treatment, and the Greeks who had been settled in Bactria and Sogdiana, who had long borne unhappily their sojourn among peoples of another race and now received word that the king has died of his wounds, revolted against the Macedonians. They formed a band of 3000 men and underwent great hardship on their homeward route. Later they were massacred by the Macedonians after Alexander’s death. 17.99.5-6.

---
&gt; The Macedonians and Alexander backed Coragus because he was one of them while the Greeks favoured Dioxippus. 17.100.4.

---
&gt; He (Alexander the Great) was plainly disappointed at the defeat of the Macedonian. Dioxippus released his fallen opponent, and left the field winner of the resounding victory and bedecked with ribands by his compatriots, as having brought a common glory to all Greeks. 17.101.1-2.

---
&gt; From Europe, the Greek cities and the Macedonians also sent embassies, as well as the Illyrians and most of those who dwell about the Adriatic Sea, the Thracian peoples and even those of their neighbours the Gauls, whose people became known then first in the Greek world. 17.113.2.

---
&gt; When oaths to this effect had been sworn and the Greeks were interspersed among the Macedonians, Pithon was greatly pleased, seeing that the affair was progressing according to his intentions; but the Macedonians remembering the orders of Perdiccas and having no regard for the oaths that had been sworn, broke faith with the Greeks. Setting upon them unexpectedly and catching them off their ground, they shot them all down with javelins and seized their possessions as plunder. Pithon then, cheated of his hopes, came back with the Macedonians to Perdiccas. 18.7.8-9

---
&gt; When the Aetolians listened to him gladly they gave him 7000 soldiers, he sent to the Locrians and the Phocians and the other neighboring peoples and urged them to assist their freedom and rid Greece of the Macedonian despotism. 18.9.5.

**Quintus Curtius Rufus, Roman Historian**, *The History of Alexander*

&gt;Alexander, in a letter, responds to Darius: ""His Majesty Alexander to Darius: Greetings. The Darius whose name you have assumed wrought utter destruction upon the Greek inhabitants of the Hellespontine coast and upon the Greek colonies of Ionia, and then crossed the sea with a mighty army, bringing the war to Macedonia and Greece."" [p.50-1]

---
&gt; Alexander speaks: ""The Macedonians are going to judge your case,"" he said. ""Please state whether you will use your native language before them.""

&gt;Philotas: ""Besides the Macedonians, there are many present who, I think, will find what I am going to say easier to understand if I use the language you yourself have been using, your purpose, I believe, being only to enable more people to understand you.""

&gt;Then the king said: ""Do you see how offensive Philotas find even his native language? He alone feels an aversion to learning it. But let him speak as he pleases - only remember he as contemptuous of our way of life as he is of our language."" [p.138]

---
&gt; [Alexander attempts to appropriate divine honours to himself] ""He wished to be believed, not just called, the son of Jupiter, as if it were possible for him to have as much control over men’s minds as their tongues, and to give orders for the Macedonians to follow the Persian customs in doing homage to him by prostrating themselves on the ground. To feed this desire of his there was no lack of pernicious flattery - over the course of royalty, whose power is often subverted by adulation than by an enemy. Nor were the Macedonians to blame for this, for none of them could bear the slightest deviation from tradition; rather it was the Greeks, whose corrupt ways had also debased the profession of the liberal arts."" [p.187-8]

**Justin, Roman Historian**

&gt; ""It came to pass, that during the absence of exertion on the part of the Greeks, the name of the Macedonians, previously mean and obscure, rose into notice; and Philip, who bad been kept three years as a hostage at Thebes, and had been imbued with the virtues of Epaminondas and Pelopidas, imposed power of Macedonia, like a yoke of bondage, upon the necks of Greece and Asia"" [6.9].

--- 
&gt;""Philip assigned the number of troops to be furnished by each state and only the King of Macedonia will be the commander of their forces. Weather Macedonia was attacked or was in a war with any other power, the Greek troops assigned by Philip had to support the Macedonian army and serve under him as their general. It's obvious that Philip had Persia in mind and knew that this is the point that obligated the Greeks to serve his dream of conquering that empire.  The Macedonian army, which will have the exclusive status, was to be supported by the Greek army and by the armies of the adjacent conquered nations"" [9.5.5-8].

4041,"Sure, tank design in the second world war was still in its infancy.IE While tanks were more reliable and useful then they were in the first war, no one was quiet sure how to use them tactically. 

The British For instance saw them as ""Land Battleships"" making them heavy and slow so the infantry could keep up. The Germans made them Super heavy, since they never needed to transport them from the battlefields of Europe. Japan, wanted light tanks capable of amphibious landings.

America however, was in the odd position where it had to A) transport a tank across oceans and B) make it fight in all conditions. From the Dry Sands of North Africa to the Steamy Jungles of the South Pacific and even the Cold of the Eastern Front. Due to this unique challenge the US had to design a single tank which could be used in all situations and that meant making one which could be easily modified. 

As such the Tank had a sort of Lego philosophy and became the basis of modern tank design. IE, Instead of Light, Heavy,Tank-Killer,ect specialist tanks. It was more successful to have 1 modifiable, main battle tank. 

This was what the Sherman set out to do and it meant American replacment parts were easy to get logistically and no specialized crew were needed. So with very little training one crew could change tanks based on the mission.

4079,"&gt; I'm not moving goalposts.

Yes you are, discussion started from reducing inequality, then you went on to claim that reducing taxes has a higher impact for poor people's quality of life - which is true - but doesn't actually reduce wealth inequality, or that inequality can also be reduced through other ways - which is also true - but doesn't address my question at all.

&gt; You think everything about inequality boils down to taxes and thats unfortunately just not accurate. Plus you literally have no idea how tax brackets work and the complete strawman

Isn't a strawman when you put arguments in someone else's mouth and argue against them instead of arguing against what they actually said? Like... claiming I argued that $100 doesn't do anything for poor people's lives or that I believe everything about inequality boils down to taxes? Cause... that is what you are doing.

&gt; Plus you literally have no idea how tax brackets work 

It is literally irrelevant, since even if a person earning 100k gets a 10% reduction and the billionaire gets a 1% reduction, it's still going to increase inequality, based on the same logic, that investing millions is going to generate additional wealth while spending 10k isn't really. Which brings us to... 

&gt; the smart rich investor compared to the ""dumb"" less fortunate who wastes the money? Please save story time for your kids.

It ain't about smart or dumb mate, why are you arguing against claims I never made? It's just common sense. The billionaire already has everything they need, they won't spend their 100 mil on buying better shit, they're mostly gonna invest that money. A poor person is very likely to use that money to better their quality of life, which is perfectly natural and not a sign of being ""dumb"", neither is it a waste of money. There are plenty of studies that can back my claim if that's what you need, if it really isn't common sense to you that a poor person is gonna spend their extra money on shit they actually need, they're not going to invest their sum in mutual funds, let's be fucking honest here. And even if they were, guess what, a million invested by the billionaire is still going to generate way more revenue, with a better ROI too, than the 10k invested by the poor guy. So your logic simply doesn't fucking work, because no matter how you wanna frame it, the billionaire is still going to make a truckload more money off his tax reduction than the poor person.

Even now you don't wanna answer my question, whether the tax reduction serves to increase or decrease inequality.

4106,"basically: Berlin is just a huge fucking money sink, even for capital standards. Berlin alone swallows about 40% of all federal funds towards states in regard of the state-financial-balance. As in: economically stronger states will fund investments into poorer ones. To prevent one state from getting all investments and getting richer and richer while all others only get poorer and poorer and to prevent over-centralization of the economy. 

So not only is Berlin's financial balanced fucked... it is SO fucked it swallows almost all contributions made by the entire nation.

To make it worse, the former Mayor of Berlin city called it ""poor, but sexy"" as if their inability to keep a budget was something to be proud of.

4139,"The cyclists from all over northern Italy (and beyond), who were waiting for this news since the project was announced at the beginning of 2017, can cheer: the countdown has officially begun for the inauguration of the first section of Garda by Bike, the 'bike ring of about 140 kilometers that will develop along the shores of Lake Garda on the territories of Trentino, Lombardy and Veneto.

The date is Saturday, July 14th at 17 in Limone sul Garda (Brescia), where the first two kilometers of the track are ready, allowing you to ride enjoying a breathtaking view of the lake up to the border with the autonomous province of Trento.

On the social networks - where enthusiasts use definitions like ""the dream cycle path"" or ""the most beautiful cycle path in Europe"" - the wait is feverish: the municipal administration of Limone sul Garda created less than 24 hours before the Facebook event dedicated to the inauguration and on the page there are already over 42 thousand people interested (but the number is constantly growing).

Moreover, the great enthusiasm surrounding the construction of Garda by Bike was already evident months ago, when a videomaker posted on Instagram an overview of the work done with the drone, obtaining tens of thousands of views.

""This is a work destined to become a major tourist attraction for Alto Garda, given the continuous increase in interest for sport holidays"", they underline from the Municipality of Limone sul Garda. The Garda by Bike cycling ring, which aims to connect all the towns on the lake's shores favoring sustainable mobility, should be completed by 2021 and, according to the initial project, will have a total cost of about 102 million euro (the stretch that will be inaugurated on July 14 has cost over seven and a half million).

The first pictures of the bike trail are available here: http://milano.repubblica.it/cronaca/2018/06/14/foto/ciclovia_lago_di_garda_limone_ciclovia_dei_sogni-198978768/1/",South Tyrol,/r/europe/comments/8r4j8g/the_bike_trail_on_lake_garda_opens_on_14th_july/e0ocklo/,standy85,1529003890

The US is still far ahead in stealth and space technology. In the game the US has cloaking technology and the ability to have troops anywhere in the world in less than a day using a military space station. 

Europe is far ahead in more conventional ways (firearms, tanks, planes, etc).

And the final faction, Russia, makes use of the soaring oil prices due to massive nuclear conflict in the Middle East to completely modernize their military and secure parts of Eastern Europe without any Western intervention because of the said nuclear conflict in the Middle East. Technologically they are the weakest but they have incredibly strong ballistic armor and tank armor and are willing to use more numbers than the other 2 factions.


What it comes down to in game is that Americans have the longest range on their units, the ability to deploy units almost anywhere on the map, and can basically turn invisible, making them kind of like a weird guerilla warfare faction. Europeans do the most damage and are the fastest. And Russians have the most numbers and their units have the most health, along with their units using things like chemical warfare giving them a lot of DoT effects.",USA?

The same day, the Red Army established a beachhead on the Western Gulf of Vyborg. The Finns proposed an armistice on 6 March, but the Soviets, wanting to keep the pressure on the Finnish government, declined the offer. The Finnish peace delegation travelled to Moscow via Stockholm and arrived on 7 March. The USSR made further demands as their military position was strong and improving. On 9 March, the Finnish military situation on the Karelian Isthmus was dire as troops were experiencing heavy casualties. Artillery ammunition was exhausted and weapons were wearing out. The Finnish government, noting that the hoped-for Franco-British military expedition would not arrive in time, as Norway and Sweden had not given the Allies right of passage, **had little choice but to accept the Soviet terms**.

So no, Soviets just didn't want to keep going since they didn't want to risk a greater war, it had nothing to do with the cost being too high or anything like that.

It depends whether you are applying the moral criteria to the past or the present.

Because they live in the northernmost part of the region of Macedonia. When you're trying to enforce your will on other countries you have to compromise. If FYROM was not economically dependent on Greece they wouldn't even bother discussing the name. Upper or Northern Macedonia works fine. It removes any concerns about irredentism and it specifies that FYROM is merely named after it's region and does not try to claim all of Macedonian history for itself.

Nope. That's not the logic. 

&gt;it results in nothing. get your shit together, reform your fucking country, stop strangling the business, lower the taxes, reduce idiotic regulations, stop spending more than you earn and you will see a damn growth with whatever currency you have.

Who are you talking to? You sound dreadfully angry. Are you well? Even though I'm all for deregulation and lower taxes, the countries that need them more are those like Italy, Portugal, Greece and so on, not mines.

I live in reality. Structural reforms are much more difficult, virtually impossible, without the weapon of currency devaluation. Nominal wage rigidity just makes it too hard. When countries like the UK (in the early 80s), Germany (late 90s), Scandinavia (late 80s), etc, embarked in serious structural reforms, they all used currency devaluation.  It's like lubricant in a motor. 

Again, it makes no sense to say ""well, screw peopel, they should sacrifice to keep the euro"". It's the other way around.

Well, he miscalculated, he pissed off too many people a little too much, then he tried shooting them in the streets, and in doing so he lost all control as everyone except hardcore Russian supporters hated him.

The US never recognized the USSR's annexation of the Baltics and refused demands from the Soviet Union to turn over the gold but made it available to the Lithuanian diplomats who were posted abroad when the USSR invaded because they were recognized as the real Lithuanian government.

4297,"&gt; Also, hate to admit this, but I didn't even know Friso-Saxon was a thing.

It's alright, most people don't. It's a dialect of Low Saxon, which in itself isn't that well known for even being language aside from being ""farmer's dialect"", even though it has a rich history of being spoken throughout the entirey of Northern Europe as a lingua franca in the medieval ages through the Hansa League. 

It's a bit of a shame, because even though Low Saxon used to be spoken much more and over a larger area, it's now dwindling and being absorbed by the national languages. It's only recently gained a regional language status in the Netherlands, for example.

Meanwhile, the Frisians have had a stronger cultural unity, as well as having full on official language status. A Frisian can even use Frisian in court or to sign/write documents, technically speaking. They have a written standards, teach it at schools, promote it in general, keeping the language alive for the most part. It's in a much healthier state than Low Saxon. It's even available on Google Translate! 

&gt;  I suppose you are one of the true cousins of English with that blend.

I once heard a old Scottish man talking to someone else in his own Scots dialect whilst in the train. Took me five minutes of listening before I realised he wasn't speaking a very odd/strong variant of Low Saxon. 

&gt; I really appreciate you showing me this because I have floated this idea of the middle-ground of North and West Germanic for a while (even spoke at length about it on reddit) but this is truly a stark example of it in action (usually I pick syntax or word similarity between them).

You're welcome! ^^ Feel free to ask more questions if you like! I enjoy talking about it since so few people know or are interested in it. My hope is that one day a standardised variant will take shape that can ensure the survival of the language as a whole. It'd be a shame to see it lost. My hopes aren't high, though. There are many variants, and previous attempts have been largely unsuccessful, especially with regards to orthography.

&gt; Quick question if you will humour me, the 'th' sound in English used to exist in the north Germanic languages (when they were east Norse) and they used the 'thorn' character to represent them. So you find that in old English and old Swedish for example. Does that exist in these Frisian dialects?

Ah, yes, I knew about that. The þorn (and I think the eð as well) sounds existed Proto-Germanic, and whatever is between that and Old Frisian / Old Saxon. I think it was fairly quickly dropped in Old Frisian / Old Saxon, but, like you said, was retained and evolved in Old English. I do vaguely remember reading it took longer for it to drop in Frisian, but I'm not sure about that. 

No traces remain of it in the languages today, though, that's for sure. ",Groningen (Netherlands),/r/europe/comments/8qh1kg/congratulations_scandinavia_the_worlds_nicest/e0o6cor/,Gilbereth,1528997577

4308,"&gt; Man u can't be serious...

I am, here's why:

&gt; I'm not talking about those who work in Ireland... That's the money of Ireland... If u want to have a lower tax rate so be it.
&gt; 
&gt; But using the free trade market so u can take the profits multinationals make in Europe and tax it, that's just stealing. Europe should have made something like a common tax rate so that multinationals would have paid their tax in the country there making the profit.

They never did, and it was known up front that companies can operate from one country across the entire EU. That's the point.

&gt; Just imagine a second if apple Amazon and all those companies were selling goods in youre country, making profit... but when u're saying them:
&gt; 
&gt; ""Hey, u made profit in our country that's cool, but u were able to do that because we have a state that protected u, formed u're employees (by making them go to school), builded the road and maintain it... And that costed money to the state, so we're asking u to participate to that by giving us a part of u're profit"".
&gt; 
&gt; Their reply is: ""Oh no, I'm a company from that other country: xxx, with wich u made a deal: its companies can free trade in your country, and u're company can free trade in xxx. So I'm paying my tax on profit I made in your country to him but your companies are paying tax to you on profit they made in the xxx country.""
&gt; 
&gt; So u say: ""Oh yeah cool...""

What you're looking for is a tax on sales. Which you have. It's called VAT. Tax on profits is where the value is generated, from patents, research, design and manufacturing.


&gt; Then, later on u realize: ""Oh wait, but why companies does not come in our country anymore? They even tend to leave when they become big enought to afford it???""

That's not what happens. Renault are still based in France (and benefit from France's low effective tax rate, which the French government don't like talking about). Ireland is a good base for companies coming from outside the EU and setting up a base within the EU.

On a side note, some of the biggest issues preventing multinational investment in France is the cost of regulatory compliance in France, labor laws etc. You would have to get that right before worrying about the tax rate 

&gt; And u realize all of a sudden, that xxx country is apealing companies with a much much lower tax rate than yours... Actually the taxe rate is so low, that if xxx was not in the free market and taxing profit made in your country, this tax rate would (very) hardly be sustainable for xxx.

It is sustainable, Ireland built its economy around a low tax take. It sees it as a competitive advantage. As a small economy it's something it is able to leverage. The big economies simply want to remove other countries competitive advantages while keeping their own so they can entirely dominate the single market.

&gt; Now how do u feel when this same country is saying to u: ""me??? stealing you??? wtf are u saying it just happened that I have a much much lower taxe rate than u! What's youre idea of a fair taxe rate??? Your taxe rate +1% ???""

You never did answer that question. What is your idea of a fair tax rate? France's effective tax rate is something like 8% for its big companies (while still subsidising companies like Airbus) is that what you think the fair rate is?",,/r/europe/comments/8qzjwo/yanis_varoufakis_ireland_a_tax_haven_freeriding/e0nwg07/,Kier_C,1528989280

There's no operational *European made* UCAV, because no one expected UAVs to roll over into UCAVs or for UCAVs to be in such a high demand.

US' UCAV program began with the RQ\-1, a UAV designed for strictly recon. They realized they could throw a few bombs on it, and presented the MQ\-1 to the world. It evolved the design to fly higher, stay up longer, and carry more, and now we have the MQ\-9. 

When the US entered a multi\-decade counter insurgency operation in the Middle East, it discovered those UAVs that could be turned into UCAVs were invaluable at cheap COIN (counter insurgency) aircaft, and heavily invested in them, leading to it absolutely dominating the UCAV market before anyone else even had a design for sale.

The Storting has decided that an increasing proportion of all fuels used in vehicles on Norwegian roads must be *biofuel* (not palm oil). By 2020, the proportion will be 20 percent, while the government will increase the proportion to 40 percent by 2030.

The reality of the tax treatment of Apple in Ireland has always been transparent and consistent, and such as it applies to them, it does the same way for other similar multinationals.

4401,"&gt; Siemens and Alstom may be optimistic about the chances of winning approval. But Mrs Vestager’s competition investigators have very rarely been convinced that markets are truly global, rather than national or regional.
&gt; 
&gt; In the Brussels view, companies should not be allowed to dominate national markets at the expense of consumers, just so they can succeed abroad. The efficiencies that come from greater scale are taken into account, but have yet to prove decisive in swaying approvals.
&gt; 
&gt; Many lawyers have tried to convince the commission to take a broader view of markets. But as Carles Esteva Mosso, the head of mergers at the commission’s competition directorate, said in 2014: “We cannot choose market definitions as we please, any more than we can change the weather in Brussels.”
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; A prototype train, built by China's CRRC the biggest railway group in the world, is put through its paces in Zhuzhou city in Hunan Province © EPA
&gt; In previous railway mergers, for instance, EU officials looked at nine different markets for rolling stock alone. There were also three distinct markets for wayside equipment, two for signalling and nine for the other systems and services.
&gt; 
&gt; Crucially, the commission analysis is typically done at national level, rather than regional or global. Europe’s rail industry still carries the imprint of old state monopolies, which have made it hard for new entrants to break in and win contracts. Siemens and Alstom remain head-to-head competitors in many such markets in western Europe; China’s CRRC, meanwhile, has yet to win a major contract in Europe.
&gt; 
&gt; Advocates of the deal argue market share statistics are of limited use because they often turn on big, infrequent tenders for multiyear projects. But the Siemens-Alstom presence is unmistakably strong in some areas, with signalling posing one of the toughest competition challenges.
&gt; 
&gt; Recommended
&gt;  
&gt; EU economy
&gt; Macron plays corporate Meccano to make European champions
&gt; The group has a 60 per cent share of the European market and a 55 per cent share in North America, according to SCI Verkehr. At a national level in Germany, Denmark and Austria, Siemens-Alstom would be a virtual monopoly.
&gt; 
&gt; “The signalling division of the new Siemens-Alstom seems to be very strong,” says Maria Leenen of SCI Verkehr, “it could be very likely that they have to sell parts from the signalling side.”
&gt; 
&gt; Rival trainmakers, such as Spain’s Talgo, believe that the issue of “unfair competition” goes beyond signalling, with Siemens-Alstom cementing a protected position in its home markets.
&gt; 
&gt; Europe’s most controversial deals — aerospace
&gt; 
&gt; In 1991 the commission exercised its power to block a merger for the first time, preventing the takeover of De Havilland, a Canadian division of Boeing, by France’s Aerospatiale and Italy’s Alenia . Backers had hoped it would spur development of Europe’s aerospace industry, but the commission feared it would create a dominant position in markets for medium-sized commuter aeroplanes.
&gt; 
&gt; “As a European competitor, we are concerned that this long protectionist situation may be now exacerbated so that a single company may control all the high-speed rolling stock business opportunities in Germany and France,” the company says.
&gt; 
&gt; Other potential issues include the access of rivals to maintenance services and related data, and the question of whether the combined group would cut research and development spending to a level where it threatens innovation.
&gt; 
&gt; Supporters of the deal see these arguments as losing sight of the bigger picture. Florent Laroche, a transport expert at the University of Lyon, accepts that the technological legacy of incumbents has seriously constrained access to rail markets. But he argues such fragmentation can only be overcome by a big player driving standardisation.
&gt; 
&gt; “The European industry needs a European champion,” he says.
&gt; 
&gt; Competition officials bristle at the suggestion that overzealous competition rules have stunted corporate Europe. Many of Europe’s biggest companies reached their size through commission approved mergers, from Vivendi and Daimler to BNP Paribas and Vodafone.
&gt; 
&gt; Of almost 7,000 deals notified since 1990, just 27 were blocked. When faced with a potential deal harmful to competition, the usual approach is to seek specific remedies, such as asset sales or promises to restrict business practices.
&gt; 
&gt; Such commitments have been required by Brussels in more than 120 deals, with varying degrees of severity. Rivals expect Siemens-Alstom to face such demands, particularly in the signalling business.
&gt; 
&gt; “It will have to go, there is no question,” says another lawyer working on the case. “One of the businesses will have to be sold.”
&gt; 
&gt; Europe’s most controversial deals — finance
&gt; 
&gt; Ms Vestager blocked the merger of the London Stock Exchange Group and Deutsche Börse in 2017, after the groups refused to sell some fixed income clearing assets to address her concerns about the deal creating a de facto monopoly. The proposed merger was the third attempt in 17 years to create an Anglo-German exchange to rival US and Asian competitors.
&gt; 
&gt; Asset sales, if required, create a separate dilemma. Any auction may give CRRC a long-sought opportunity to establish itself in Europe — defeating the China-beating reasoning of the merger. “It does seem an own goal,” the lawyer says. “In pure competition terms, why not? But it would look foolish to anyone with a brain.”
&gt; 
&gt; This highlights a broader challenge facing the commission. One of its roles is to police Europe’s state aid curbs, which are the strictest in the world. Yet in vetting mergers it is unable to take account of the competitive threat posed by companies enjoying state-support from non-EU countries, such as China.
&gt; 
&gt; With strong Franco-German support, the EU is examining reforms to allow for much tougher screening of foreign investments in strategic sectors. But while it may stop Beijing’s encroachment into the EU market, it does not relax the competition regime that European champions must fit to their ambitions.
&gt; 
&gt; “When the EU merger regulation was adopted in 1989, the main concern, about foreign takeovers, if any, was not about China but about Japan,” says Sir Philip Lowe, the former head of the commission’s competition department. “There is always some country out there which people think is about to invade the entire European market.”",Not Sweden; in NL,/r/europe/comments/8r1p8k/the_francogerman_deal_that_could_derail_europes/e0nouwm/,dnivi3,1528982021

Why? Just demand certain environmental and quality standards are met, and let farmers price their products accordingly. Like every other industry.

If that causes financial problems for consumers, compensate them in some way. The current system lowers food prices artificially even for people who have no problems paying the actual costs.

\&gt; and self sufficiency

If self sufficiency means having enough food for everyone at all times then I'd agree, and I don't mind paying for that. But that money should only be spend on crops that are relatively efficient to produce, like grains and most vegetables; and maybe a limited amount of animal products.

u/KilometresOMalley goes into a little bit more detail

&gt;Apple payed tax in Ireland on it's Irish sales. The rest of Europe's sales are owed to where they're headquartered \- the United States. Whether they pay the US is the US's business. The revenues were still registered in Ireland, but the Irish rules say they're only interested in Irish figures. That wasn't ""special treatment"" as alleged in the politically weaponized competition ruling. Every multinational here is treated precisely the same way.  
&gt;  
&gt;Ireland is one of the only countries to make direct legislative changes to combat tax evasion. There is not, nor has there ever been a large corporate tax evasion scheme which involved Ireland, which didn't depend on loopholes which existed in other jurisdictions (actual tax havens like the Crown Dependencies). The best they could ever hope for in attempting to ""tax launder"" their funds in Ireland \- was 12.5&amp;#37; or very close to it.  
&gt;  
&gt;You morons should be *delighted* that those funds are being domiciled in Ireland. YOUR COUNTRIES STILL COLLECT THE TAX ON IT. But Ireland's required contribution to the EU goes up as a result \- the money never touches the Irish economy, but we pay more to the bloc for it.  
&gt;  
&gt;P.S. Nothing in the Irish tax system is in violation of any existing EU rule, period. The right of Ireland to set our own tax rates was also affirmed in the Lisbon Treaty, following ratification in Ireland. No change to the rules allowing countries to set their own tax rates is likely to pass in the medium term, nor should it. We have the right to *choose* to have an attractive base for business to operate (as do you, you simply *choose* not to). There are sacrifices that entails, but the benefits to our society have been enormous. We do not apologize for it. We do not owe you anything for it.

The IMF wanted it's money back to them it didn't matter whether the Greek pay it or the EU.

&gt;He did. 

That's just a more wordy and less facetious way of saying the same thing e.g.

&gt;This is why we keep telling the institutions that, yes, we need pension reform but, no, you cannot just lob off 1% of GDP from pensions without causing massive, fresh misery and a fresh recessionary round as this 1.8 billion multiplied by a large fiscal multiplier (up to 1.5) is withdrawn from the circular flow of income. If large pensions still existed, whose curtailment would make a fiscal difference, we would do it. But the distribution of pensions is so compressed that savings of such a magnitude would have to eat into the pensions of the poorest. It is for this reason, I suppose, that the institutions are asking us to eliminate the solidarity pensions supplement to the poorest of the poor.  

That roughly translates to, I know we fucked up with pensions and can't afford to pay them, but cutting them is out of the question. That's completely true but not the problem of other countries to solve.

&gt;And it is for this reason that we counter-propose proper reforms: a drastic reduction, almost elimination, of early retirements, consolidation of pension funds and interventions in the labour market that reduce undeclared labour.

It isn't now, but it's a great deal easier and cheaper to scale up the ESM than to see countries drop out of the euro.

&gt; The rest are projects that have not been approved yet.

Not true, the Single Supervisory Mechanism is in effect since 2014 and the Single Resolution Mechanism for failing banks went into force in 2016. There is no European Monetary Fund yet and maybe there won't be (decisions are likely to be taken at the upcoming European Council summit), but here again, you have to assess the options in light of the alternative. 

&gt; Anyway, calling the circumstances in 2008 most difficult is unfair. One can easily imagine a more turbulent scenario, especially if it doesn't originate in the US. 

I don't know, adding together a banking crisis, a sovereign debt crisis, and a severe economic recession together seems like a pretty good stress test to me.

&gt; Furthermore, the main reason for contagion was the eurozone itself, as Greece, Portugal etc didn't have a direct link to Wall Street. Froost difficult is unfair.

Furthermore, the main reason for contagion was the eurozone itself, as Greece, Portugal etc didn't have a direct link to Wall Street. From their perspective, you could even say they missed out on all that sweet, cheap dollar investment while QE was at its height. 

Cheap dollar investment? The point of QE was to make the eurro cheaper, not the dollar. I don't understand what you're trying to say here, also since you're throwing together the banking crisis in the US with the debt crisis in the euro. The two are connected but not the same and the timeframe is differentt too.

Today their finance minister may be playing nice but tomorrow if they a legit democratic mandate to fuck with euro membership the shock won't be just a couple points on the euro index.

Italy's 10-year bond yield went from 1,75% to over 3% before the new government had even entered into office. Two thirds of Italian debt is held within Italy.

It is also not an argument _for the euro_.

&gt; There is no reasonable way to go back to your currency because simply just like something like the Euro was never done before, obviously, leaving a shared currency like the Euro wasn't done before either

Sure there has been. There are a lot of parallels with the gold standard. The really special thing is the world we live in and the euro exists in, but a single currency isn't that much of an innovation in itself.

&gt; The defence is that the Euro is not the problem. The Euro does have problems, sure, but it isn't one. The problems are structural in some Euro-countries.

The euro has problems, is the cause of those problems and it is a structural problem in itself. Problems don't have to have one source. Indeed countries all have their individual issues on top of the euro, but taking away independent monetary policy actually makes it more difficult for them to solve these local problems.

&gt; And no, going back to a national currency wouldn't solve those. It might ease them but that will be negated by hyper inflation and financial collapse. And afterwards those problems will be there again.

Humanity can only achieve with this planet, what we can agree on - or at least what a big enough majority agrees on that can make the minority act a certain way (because kooks and assholes will never go extinct). Everyone can agree on keeping and improving our current level of comfort and technology while going green. It sure is not easy, the technology is not there yet, but I believe it can be achieved and since we can build a concensus around that, that is what we should work towards.

Some species might go extinct in the mean time, I have little hope for the lesser attractive creepy crawlies that simply don't have a lobby and even some of the well known, beloved species will go extinct thanks to humanity talking just sooooo fucking long to come to terms with the fact that the main concern our species should have is developing greener technologies because the Earth is a ressource we only have one of.

Why? What makes this a rule?

I'd argue that it's exactly the opposite. Left wing and right wing alliances help bring nepotists and authoritarians to power. We always used to have mostly right wing governments and left wing oppositions or left wing governments and right wing oppositions. The exchange between those two is what made Europe prosper and is what built most of our current welfare states. The dualism gave people a side they belong to and a side they could attack

It's not coincidence that authoritarian figures started popping up after Third Way social democracy. With more and more centrist governments including both right and left wing parties, the dualism has shifted from 'Evil/Good left wing vs Evil/Good right wing' to 'Evil/Good establishment vs Evil/Good populists'.

It can be argued that the only reason AfD got into the Bundestag, is because the previous coalition was between SPD and CDU. And that now the current coalition is AGAIN SPD and CDU, the SPD and CDU will lose their majority next election cycle.

4632,"That would mean 'kicking out' Ireland from the common market, which i hope noone with an ounce of common sense would want. It would solve some of the hardest Brexit problems admittedly...

I understand you don't want someone else to decide your taxes, even though no matter how small you draw your borders, there will always be someone else deciding your taxes. Until you declare yourself the independent nation of MasterBerter that is...

Try to understand the problem from the viewpoint of the rest of the EU. Our societies offer a pretty high standard of living, educated and healthy workforce, infrastructure, business networks, a 500mil population with comparatively high disposable income. These make the EU market very appealing for international corporations, but it also costs a ton of money to maintain. 

Irelands corporate tax rate is already low, special loopholes for megacorps not even considered. Apple as an extreme example paid 0.005% taxes in 2014 on the whole of their EU profits to Ireland. This effectively means they operate tax free in the EU, while Ireland with its less than 5mill population still gets enough out of it apparently. How do you not understand that this is not ok?

If we actually did what you suggest and closed Ireland's access to the common market, those megacorps would have to relocate as well. Because as nice as Ireland is, it's own consumer market is not what Apple etc. are after and even if they stayed a tax rate of less than 1% on their profits generated *in Ireland alone* would leave your country broke in no time.

Noone's trying to dictate your policies but you gotta understand how this is a problem and why there's a need to find a workable compromise no?

4657,"&gt; If the Polish government has not done enough to ensure the independence of the judiciary, how on earth has the Romanian government done so with all the justice laws recently?

Let me take 1 part of the new law about the judiciary that is quite frankly malicious on part of the ruling party of Poland:

The ability for the president to extend the terms of judges. With the ability to extend the terms of judges you can effectively punish those who you don't agree with and reward those you agree with by extending their terms.

Besides the obvious point that therefore the president can move the results of ruling to a certain side, it also means that judges might consider a possible term extension when they make a ruling.

And now why i think it's malicious:

This law is bad, no way around it. Now there's a common saying that you should never attribute to maliciousness if it can be explained by incompetence. Well that means that there must be another way to explain why this law was included in the changes for it to be a sideeffect that might mean it was incompetence.

But there isn't a secondary explanation. The rule only makes any sense if you want to be able to influence the judges. That only leaves maliciousness as a possible reason.

Secondly it has been stated that the changed rules were made with the German system in mind. That is blatantly false, the 2 systems have more differences than not.

In Poland the president elects the judges for life until they reach retirement age. The retirement age may be extended 4 years by the president on a case by case basis.

In Germany the highest judges are elected half by the lower and half by upper parliament, equalizing the states and the country. Also each judge has to be elected with a 2/3rd majority, which most of the time means the leading coalition cannot vote in judges on their own. Also each judge is elected for 12 years with no extension possible.

4777,"&gt; Please, feel free to point such regions to me, in order to understand your thinking.

Are you serious? Germany was wiped out more or less completely. Forget Germany, China experienced the worst ever, losing their population like no other country did. They were invaded, genocided, bombed to shits and now they are a superpower. Russia lost 25 million people in overall. France was also heavily damaged.

&gt; So, what? Are we genetically inferior? Cursed by the Gods? Or just like fucking each other over and over again?

Stop trolling. What you are doing wrong is that you are getting stuck in quarrels which you must have been over with decades ago. Name of Macedonia? Fucking unbelievable.

&gt; a form of free speech, a

No we did not have ""free speech"" when you had Ottomans over there. We had fucking bloody sectarian wars here, babies were killed because they belonged to families belonging to the heretic sect. You have no fucking idea about the inner conflicts we went through here apparently. Also, Napoleon, who overran pretty much over here, was not a free speech promoter, if you forgot, but rather a militarist who believed in expansionism and domination by force.

Just because you had worse infrastructure in Balkans, does not mean you experienced worse things than we did. In fact, if you look at the head count, probably we died more than you did over there. 

&gt; . Sorry if this breaks your (largely simplified) idea of what was and what wasn't the Ottoman period here, but that is a fact which can be seen during... your vacation. Large parts of Greece (Ionian Islands, Crete, Aegean Islands, Cyprus), Albania and ex-Yugoslavian countries (Croatia, Slovenia, Montenegro) where under Western rule (Venetian and Genoese or Habsburg) and they advanced way more than the Balkan mainland. 

You are writing irrelevant stuff now. We are not talking about low infrastructure. At least I did not criticize Balkans for having crappy roads or bad airports. So, stick to the topic.

&gt; These people's mentality is quite different than the mentality of other Greeks.

Yet you seem to have the same mentality when it comes to stupid discussions like name issues of region.

&gt; I never said it did. I merely tried to explain that the Balkans were affected by the Ottoman 'everyday culture'. By the way, Ottoman period is not only 1453. They left the wider 'Macedonia' area barely a century ago. Greek irredentism fought and lost in Central Turkey in 1922. Serbian irredentism died in the Yugoslav wars. FYROM's nationalism, just like Albanian, is still forming. So, one could say that the naming issue is by a small percent indirectly related to the Ottoman era.

Oh boy, that's as stupid as Israelis blaming the current conflicts on Roman administration of Judea.

You are doomed dude. This mentality won't take you anywhere. After a thought, I won't discuss this anymore. You cannot explain colors to a blind. Sorry.

4785,"To be fair, Neumann worked on cooperative games earlier than anyone else (which is part of game theory and his work set the framework and much of the language that game theory was built on), but Nash was the first to publish specifically on non-cooperative games (which kind of made game theory a ""complete"" field when combined with cooperative games as a ""sub-field"").

I'm saying this as someone who is Hungarian and a fan of math (of which game theory is my favorite).

Also to be fair, this all happened very close together in time. Neumann invented a sub-field of a field that hadn't been invented yet. He introduced the idea of equilibria within a decision making and payoff context, which really is what makes game theory, ""game theory."" However, it's hard to imagine it without Nash equilibria either.

Many applications of game theory is at least some mix of cooperation and non-cooperation, and that divide between the two is useless in many scenarios. It is harder, however, to find examples of cooperative game theory without aspects of non-cooperative theory than vice versa. I don't think it's ""wrong"" to consider Nash the inventor of game theory due to the fact that non-cooperative game theory introduced an incredible amount of complexity to the premise of ""decision-making and payoffs."" Evolutionary games require non-cooperative game theory, for example.

Math is also a lot more social and human than I think people tend to realize. It really is just philosophy that emphasizes quantitative rather than allegorical demonstration. Neumann probably could have been the one to first examine non-cooperative games closely if his interest and schedule focused on it. However, Nash was a genius as well who was the one to first get around to form critical ideas around it. I'm sure Neumann knew early on that a theory of non-cooperative games was very possible to create, but he just wasn't the one to get around creating it.",,/r/europe/comments/8qta9i/endianess_of_date_and_address_formats_in_europe/e0nd5x9/,IceNeun,1528961439

I'm not sure that this is knee-jerk.  I've been commenting on the bans for a bit.

4846,"I'm not sure if you're not good with analogies or just not good with time.

Assuming that a city is within it's natural time zone and doesn't fuck with things through daylight saving time -- that is to say, all things being equal and accounting for obvious man-made adjustments and the inherent imprecision of time zones and the axial tilt of the earth -- you know that 6 AM is exactly 4 hours before noon.  You know that at any point on Earth, when the Earth rotates another 60 degrees after 6 AM local time, the sun will be at it's apex in the sky.  You know this because that's the definition of what *solar* noon is.  Clock time is still roughly analogous to sundial time.  Yes, sundial time can run 15 to 20 minutes fast or slow depending on the time of year due to axial tilt and different speeds in Earth's orbit, but that's certainly good enough for estimation and well within the error range of man-made time zones and all the other nonsense adjustments we make.

It doesn't matter if Finland doesn't see the sun in January.  Their clocks are still based on the apex of the sun in the sky during the rest of the year.  6 AM in Helsinki and 6 AM in Istanbul are both going to be 4 hours before local noon plus or minus about 20 minutes.

It if had the same macroeconomic fundamentals, it's nominal wages would be close to Hungary's.

One way to see this is by going to the World Bank's database website and search for ""2010 gdp per capita constant"" and then comparing Turkey and Bulgaria. Turkey is *way* above Bulgaria on the latter, but the constant depreciation has meant that its wages has now fallen behind even a poor country like Bulgaria. This is not because BulgariaStronk. It is beacause of indigenous factors in Turkey. Nothing else.

Source? They are still running a small fiscal deficit, however with high inflation and even if you're assuming relatively low growth(let's say 1/2th of what Türkstat is claiming) that will still give you either stable or declining debt to GDP. You're giving anecdotal evidence about this or that subsidy. I'm looking at the full fiscal account. Turkey is running a tight budget. 

&gt; I think we'll see negative growth for some number of quarters

Türkstat already falsifies the growth numbers, so I doubt we'll see negative numbers. I don't actually think that Turkey is in a recession. Nor do I think it is likely to be in one soon.


Instead, the problem is two-fold: first, the numbers are massaged upwards. Second, the quality of growth (excessive inflation, very high current account deficit) means that the currency will continously depreciate in order to fund the negative balance of payments. This procress has meant that the lira has weakened 3X against the US dollar since 2010, far above than other peer countries (mostly in Eastern Europe, even those without the Euro).",Europe,/r/europe/comments/8qra5m/turkeys_economic_crisis_has_just_begun_what/e0n3ivd/,FriendOfOrder,1528946791

Yes, many did convert and become Muslims. Doesn't detract from the fact that there were Christian populations that identified as Turks. They are often referred to as ""Turkish speaking"" Christians (if you even bother to do some research). They did not speak the Greek language -&gt; they did not identify as Greek -&gt; they only spoke Turkish -&gt; and identified as Turks of the Christian faith.

4940,"I think it's a serious compromise. It doesn't make any side particularly happy, but it lets the two nations move on and focus on other issues. I'm not happy with it, but at the same time I understand the realpolitik behind the deal.

Greek Macedonians get to see their identity compromised and devalued in the international stage in favor of what we think of as a usurper state.
Citizens of the Republic of North Macedonia see their self-chosen identity be forcibly changed - no matter how legitimate their claim to this identity is or isn't, I understand that they grew up with that name, and it doesn't feel nice to them to be asked to change that.

From my side, I think the deal has a few issues:  
1) Our government promised an untranslated name that would be used worldwide. I thought that was a negotiation line that wouldn't be crossed. So even people on reddit would have to call them Severna Makedonija. Instead of that, they get an English translation. I was really surprised to see that in the final deal.  
2) I think it's a major concession to establish the ethnicity or language as ""Macedonian"". There's about 2 million inhabitants in FYROM, and there's about 2.5 inhabitants in Greek Macedonia. Technically speaking, more people who would call themselves ""Macedonian"" speak Greek instead of ""Macedonian"", more of those Macedonians exist as Citizens of the Hellenic Republic than as Citizens of the Republic of North Macedonia. The full text of the current deal does not protect that self-identification as much as I would have hoped. It almost feels like ""North Macedonia"" was ""smart"" to break away from Yugoslavia and establish themselves as an independent state, while Greek Macedonia was ""dumb"" to remain a part of the Hellenic Republic instead of breaking away as a state to claim their name and identity in the world's stage.   
3) I would have liked to see issues such as country codes, ""protected designation of origin"" terminology, etc, figured out before the deal is finalized instead of a ""we totally promise to have a working group formed in 2019 and resolve issues in 3 years after that"". I would like to see some goodwill and have the name of the country changed in google maps, reddit, etc, before the deal is considered complete and Greece concedes NATO/EU membership.

Still, I think it's as good of a deal as one can realistically get. I'm not really confident that it will pass approval from both countries' chambers. I think there's too much premature celebration. I hope I'm wrong. In the end of the day, I want us to build a good relationship with them. Greek people have more than a thousand years of bad blood between us and Bulgaria (from the Eastern Roman-Bulgarian wars, all the way to WWII), but we're buddies in the EU now. I don't see why we can't coexist with ""North Macedonia"" once this is resolved.

&gt; The evil acts committed by criminals in camp are innumerable. The unfortunates are those from whom the thief steals their last rags, confiscates their last coin. The working man is afraid to complain, for he sees that the criminals are stronger than the camp authorities. The thief beats the working man and forces him to work. Tens of thousands of people have been beaten to death by thieves.

Something criminal has entered into their souls for ever. Thieves and their morality have left an indelible mark on the soul of each.

Lol, it's a weird way to say elected leaders. There weren't any worlords before the end of the First Chechen War, and no warlord have ruled Chechnya but Putin installed Kadyrov. No Chechen government also even did anything to surrounding regions, and ones that went into Dagestan were rouge groups which were a thing after the First Chechen War. Instability was about pro-Russian folks and Russia, which tried a coup d'état and started a civil war via the backing of Russia.

&gt; I agree there probably isn't outside the Balkans nowadays. As victims of Russia and Muslims, past crimes of the Circassians will inevitably be overlooked in the present political climate.

No such a reputation in Balkans either. That only have happened in Bulgaria, and that was about komita villages, and since the Russian effect. Those units weren't also ""Circassians"" but made up with various groups, and nobody cleansed anyone or settled in there.

&gt; The Circassians were harsh towards the Bulgarians because they saw them as easily exploitable victims, since they were Christians, had few weapons and the Ottoman authorities cared little about Muslim crimes against Christians.

Nope. No such a thing. Bulgarian komita villages weren't with few weapons, nor easy to exploit. Circassians were also settled in other areas as well, but nothing like this have happened towards the Christians that would be really easy to exploit  and who were really without weapons.

&gt; RaidingThere were no uprising by Bulgarian revolutionaries before 1876 was anyway an old Circassian tradition, just adapted to new conditions.

Nope, sorry. Raiding wasn't a traditon or anything but Circassians that were settled in Bulgaria were from the democratic tribes, where raiding was declared illegal and illigit.

Why would the average Azerbaijani, who at the time was located inside of the Russian Empire, understand what was happening within the Ottoman Empire? You should perhaps quit assuming and start thinking. 

&gt;Nope Christan populations in the Ottoman empire were remnants of the christian populations of the Byzantine empire that managed to stay christians despite all the pressures they had to endure from the Turks.

It doesn't matter if they were originally Greek, Armenian, Kenyan or Alien. Are you aware that identity of people throughout human history has changed? An example being Greece's neighbor, Bulgaria, was once a Turkic entity that eventually became Slavic and adopted Christianity - see Old Bulgaria. 

This is not any different to those people in history who ended up becoming Turks in Anatolia. The fact of the matter is you have a group of people who only speak Turkish, are of the Christian faith, and identify with their nation and lands... There are even Turks to this day inside of Turkey, who identify themselves to be Turkish and practice the Christian faith. Is this some sort of surprise for you or are you just trying to make me claim that they were originally Greek or something - as if that accomplishes anything? The fact of the matter is they didn't speak Greek and didn't identify with the Greek nation, but by their language, religion and home. Language plays an important part in shaping ones ethnic identity. 

&gt;The Turks were only muslims and their empire a caliphate. Religion is no ethnicity but those christians never identified themselves as Turks (those who impose on them so many difficulties that made them 2nd rate citizens). The only christian Turkish population were/are those in Gagauzia which is another location far from the one in question.

I don't think you understand that when you imply Turks, you are implying all Turkic people. There are Christian Turks in Gagauzia like you said, in Chuvashia, in Yakutia, and in other locations. There are even a **Turkic** people called the Urums in Crimea, who ancestrally were once Greeks and are Christians. That doesn't mean they are still Greeks though... There are even Jewish Turkic people historically with their own kingdom, or existing groups still found in Ukraine today... Fact of the matter is, religion has been a tool for Turkic people. Just as it has been a tool for any other nation to use in political means. The Ottoman ruler, ruled both as the Caliph and as the Caesar, although he was not recognized by either the Arabs or Romans to be a Caliph or Caesar. 

I am hoping you are taking away something from these conversations, if not let me know in advance so I don't waste any more time.

5001,"&gt;Parliament wouldn't make a decision without a referendum.

Sort of, the Tories, Lib Dems and UKIP promised a referendum, there was a lot of support (as in something like 75%+ support) for a referendum, so it was promised, and that manifesto promise was delivered on when the Tories won the election in 2015.  A large part of the reason behind the support for the referendum was that people felt that they couldn't have a say on the EU through the normal political process. Essentially the only way you could cast an anti-EU vote was to vote UKIP, which the vast majority of people simply didn't want to do. So, a party made a promise that a referendum would be held because they felt it would get them votes...

Parliament then voted on legislation enabling a referendum, setting the terms and the question. The referendum itself was advisory, and it'd be up to Parliament to act again after the referendum. Which it did.

&gt;And why is there an investigation, like you say there is if there is 'not very much evidence of meddling'.

That's a bizarre question.. Its an investigation to determine if there is evidence to support such a claim. The investigation is supposed to look for, and find evidence. It's a bit like asking why you'd have the police investigate the report of a crime, they do it to assess whether a crime occurred and to gather any evidence.

The territory FYROM controls was never inhabited by ancient greek Macedonians but was partially included in the province of macedonia under Roman, Eastern Roman(byzantine) and  Ottoman rule. In fact, their capital Skopje known as Scupium in Latin and Scopii or Scupii in Greek was never part of the province of macedonia.

5036,"The issues we are having are mostly political at the root of things. The Central Bank is doing it's job...too late, and too little - the second last interest rate hike, managing to halt the USD/TRY parity at 4.5, was absolutely necessary, according to Prof. Refet Gürkaynak. However, the idea that the Central Bank will not be able to move in the future, due to political pressure from Erdoğan, persists.

This why Erdoğan must go, and this is why we want him gone. Notice that both İnce and Akşener are emphasizing the rule of law, and an independent Central Bank for their presidential campaigns. Once (and perhaps if) either is elected, the economy will be on a path to recovery.

The one mistake I believe practically everybody is making both outside of Turkey and some within Turkey is the belief that Erdoğan and the AKP can survive as an opposition party. Erdoğan is not a politician who can be opposition, and nor is the AKP a party that can be opposition. The AKP was designed solely to maintain power, not to be a participant in a participatory, pluralistic democratic process. It was designed to win elections, not lose them. The moment the AKP loses an election, AND (not OR) loses power subsequently, they are gone. The relationship between the AKP and the opposition in Turkey is not like the relationship between the Tories and Labour in the UK.

Imagine Putin somehow losing an election and falling into ""opposition"", with the electoral machine that is commonly known as United Russia being an opposition party. The AKP being anything remotely like an opposition party is as ludicrous as that.

Bottom line is, the crisis can be prevented *only if* the correct political moves are taken, such as ending the state of emergency, restoring the rule of law, and immediately allowing the Central Bank to do its job.

5039,"&gt;No, VW paid just shy of $3bn in criminal fines in the US. It set out a 11 million vehicle worldwide recall program worth about that much though. But its up to the owner to take their cars in to have it looked at.

You're mixing up different things. VW only paid around $3bn in fines to the US government for breaking US law. Then they still had to pay another $20 billion as part of their settlement with US car owners to buy them back as part of the class action settlement. The criminal fines had nothing to do with the settlement, they were separate cases. 

The cars weren't look at. They just agree to buy them back fully from US car owners. The US settlement with US car owners was way way more favorable to car owners. In Europe, they agree to just have them looked and to give it a software update to get rid of the defeat device (which also reduced the performance). 

&gt;That's not true though. VAG AG has had a program in place to fix the problem in affected cars. Passing emissions standards isn't the problem, the problem is offering the performance that that consumers demand of new cars. They can easily fixed the problem in affected cars, but it sacrifices a good few horses. Sure the affected vehicles now have worse resale value than their Japanese competitors, but they have hardly sunk below the notorious Jaguar Land Rover resale value. All VAG brands are still very popular in both US and EU, and they are exponentially growing in China.

Yeah, but like you said the issue was the performance and also the fact that the value of these diesels has plummeted now that everyone is worried that diesels will soon be made illegal (as many cities have already started banning them, even in germany). These cars also lost a lot of value because their reputation is now bad in the public's mind. 

The loss to consumers is what their resale value is post\-scandal, compared to what their resale value would have been if VW had never cheated in the first place. ",,/r/europe/comments/8qtwtt/diesel_emissions_scandal_vw_fined_1bn_by_german/e0mx8j3/,sandyhands2,1528939879
5040,"&gt; Why is she so offended I always thought that if you wear a headscarf, you want to be identified as a Muslim? 

I'm not all that familiar with Islam on the matter, but I expect that the point was not to ""show the colors"" but for pious modesty.

*googles*

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijab#In_Islamic_scripture

&gt;The clearest verse on the requirement of modest dress is surah 24:30–31, telling women to guard their private parts and draw their khimār over their bosoms.[15][16]
&gt;
&gt;&gt;And say to the believing women that they should lower their gaze and guard their private parts; that they should not display their beauty and ornaments except what (must ordinarily) appear thereof; that they should draw their khimār over their breasts and not display their beauty except to their husband, their fathers, their husband's fathers, their sons, their husbands' sons, their brothers or their brothers' sons, or their sisters' sons, or their women, or the slaves whom their right hands possess, or male servants free of physical needs, or small children who have no sense of the shame of sex; and that they should not strike their feet in order to draw attention to their hidden ornaments.
&gt;
&gt;— Quran 24:31
&gt;
&gt;In Surah 33:59 Muhammad is commanded to ask his family members and other Muslim women to wear outer garments when they go out, so that they are not harassed:[16]
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Those who harass believing men and believing women undeservedly, bear (on themselves) a calumny and a grievous sin. O Prophet! Enjoin your wives, your daughters, and the wives of true believers that they should cast their outer garments over their persons (when abroad): That is most convenient, that they may be distinguished and not be harassed.
&gt;
&gt;— Quran 33:58–59
&gt;
&gt;The word ḥijāb in the Quran refers not to women's clothing, but rather a spatial partition or curtain.[5] Sometimes its use is literal, as in the verse which refers to the screen that separated Muhammad's wives from the visitors to his house (33:53), while in other cases the word denotes separation between deity and mortals (42:51), wrongdoers and righteous (7:46, 41:5), believers and unbelievers (17:45), and light from darkness (38:32).[5]

Christianity has it too, though it's not as widespread today.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_headcovering

&gt;Christian head covering and hair covering is the veiling of the head by women in a variety of Christian traditions. Some Christian women, based on historic Catholic, Lutheran, Reformed and Methodist teaching, wear the head covering in public worship (though some women belonging to these traditions may also choose to wear the head covering outside of church),[1] while others, especially Anabaptist Christians, believe women should wear head coverings all the time.[2] The practice of Christian headcovering was inspired by a traditional interpretation of 1 Corinthians 11:2–16 in the Christian Bible.

[1 Corinthians 11:2-16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+11%3A2-16&amp;version=NKJV):

&gt;&gt;Now I praise you, brethren, that you remember me in all things and keep the traditions just as I delivered them to you.  But I want you to know that the head of every man is Christ, the head of woman is man, and the head of Christ is God.  Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonors his head.  But every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head, for that is one and the same as if her head were shaved.  For if a woman is not covered, let her also be shorn. But if it is shameful for a woman to be shorn or shaved, let her be covered.  For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God; but woman is the glory of man.  For man is not from woman, but woman from man.  Nor was man created for the woman, but woman for the man.  For this reason the woman ought to have a symbol of authority on her head, because of the angels.  Nevertheless, neither is man independent of woman, nor woman independent of man, in the Lord.  For as woman came from man, even so man also comes through woman; but all things are from God.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Judge among yourselves. Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered?  Does not even nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a dishonor to him?  But if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her; for her hair is given [a]to her for a covering.  But if anyone seems to be contentious, we have no such custom, nor do the churches of God.

-

&gt;Until at least the 18th century, the wearing of a hair covering, both in the public and while attending church, was regarded as customary for Christian women in Mediterranean, European, Middle Eastern, and African cultures.[18] Women who did not wear hair coverings were interpreted to be ""a prostitute or adultreress"".[18][19] In Europe, law stipulated that married women who uncovered their head in public was evidence of her infidelity.[20]",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/8qpvf6/denmark_swings_right_on_immigration_and_muslims/e0mx8lk/,vokegaf,1528939881

LOL at the personal attack because I actually looked into the link you posted.  

&gt;Even if it's not up to the standards of scientific journals (which was never claimed), over 360 different reports do give an overall picture of the lay of the land.

Is it even up to any standards at all? And even disregarding sample size, that still depends on how it was selected.

&gt;You can check immigrant crimes in the relevant issues of PKS, but even without bothering to see them for myself, I can guarantee you they didn't magically quadruple over 2 years.

So? For all we know, they might still be underreported now - I wouldn't be surprised, considering the convoluted metric he picked.

If I wanted to test for media overrepresenting crimes committed by immigrants, I'd check the number of crimes committed by immigrants, then check their coverage, and get a ratio; check the number of crimes with immigrant victims, then check their coverage and get another ratio. Then all I needed to do would be to compare ratios. 

He most likely has those numbers, but instead decided to give us the variations relatively to 2014.

&gt;German media was found have increased crime reports with immigrant suspects by 4 times from 2014 to 2016, while decreasing reports of crimes with immigrant victims by 50% - despite both categories recording a 33% increase in that time period.

1. This is a useless metric - it wasn't even adjusted to the gravity of the crimes. What type of crimes immigrants are commiting/being victim of matters. 

2. One just needs to glance the author's twitter account to realize he's a pro-illegal immigration fanatic. I wondered if this study will ever be replicated. Until I read this:

3. &gt; he and his team analyzed 283 articles from four leading national German newspapers and 81 TV news reports 

What kind of risible sample is this? This is one of those ""studies"" that partisan academics put out strictly to push their partisan agenda in the media. 

This wasn't peer-reviewed, wasn't published on a journal. It was a partisan who put out some propaganda he authored masquerading as ""science"" and ""expertise"". Then people wonder why people don't trust experts any longer. 

I've written to him asking for access to the primary data, let's see what he says. 

On the same article, 

&gt;In July, a team of researchers at the Otto Brenner Institute published a critical study documenting massive media shortfalls, arguing that leading daily newspapers' coverage was one-sided and did not take an objective view of public policy.

&gt;The mainstream media in fact applauded this new, welcoming side of the German public and government, and covered touching refugee stories, disregarding what many other Germans felt about the influx.

&gt;That study sifted through more than 30,000 newspaper reports and found journalists used what became known as the Willkommenskultur (welcoming culture) slogan to put moral pressure on citizens to contribute to the cause of helping refugees. According to the study, such coverage contributed to a loss of trust in the mainstream media.

At least this one has a decent sample. Strangely enough, there was no request for self-censorship back then from these people. I wonder if it was because that media bias matched their own views - surely not, after all these are experts only interested in facts! 

More to the point, if the numbers are relative to 2014, how the heck do you know if the problem wasn't that **crimes committed by immigrants were under-reported in 2014**?

Why on earth did they make the study relatively to 2014? Why not just point out ""% of crimes commited by immigrants that are covered"" vs ""% of crimes where immigrants are victims that are covered""?

Taken from Wikipedia:

&gt;The consistent points in Francoism included above all authoritarianism, nationalism, national Catholicism, militarism, conservatism, anti-communism and anti-liberalism as well as a frontal rejection of Freemasonry.

The only reason why there're so much references to Franco not being a fascist —which is just hilarious, because every other neighboring anti-communist dictatorship at the point was fascist (why would we be different?)— it's because historical revisionism, which goes among the exceptionality that was that the dictatorship was never overturned and judged in Spain, but was given instead a free pass, which allowed so many people to keep writing about the glories of it without shame.

&gt;In that case 80% of all governments in the 1900s would be fascist lmao

5164,"&gt;This represents political engagement.

If anything it does the opposite, it's an attempt to entirely shift the blame on what is essentially an internal political issue on to external actors. It literally ignores the fact that there are legitimate internal political issues, or any questions about the EU's direction and instead points at the most visibly 'nasty' groups that have raised issues.. Take the quotes:

*[There is a]“circle of evil around our continent” [stretching from] “Putin, Erdogan, and on a bad day – and that’s every day at the moment – even Trump”....""But our problem runs deeper than that, deeper than only foreign policy or external security. Europe has a fifth column in its ranks. Let’s be honest.""..""I call them the cheerleaders of Putin: Le Pen, Wilders, Farage. They’re doing only one thing: they take Kremlin money, they take Kremlin intelligence.""*

That doesn't seem like political engagement, that almost reads like an argument that anyone opposed to the current EU represents an external evil, as though having a different position was unacceptable, and that opposition to the EU put you in bed with Russia, Trump, Le Pen, Wilders and Farage. It ignores that there are a huge number of people who have concerns.

For reading, it barely uses up any additional time. (The time it takes to read something is not directly proportional to the number of characters in that text). In fact I would argue that it reduces the time to read in many cases due to the above mentioned parsing advantage.

For writing, it might be a little slower to always write the whole year, but really: How often do you write dates?

So even if this nonsense passes, it *probably* won't have any far reaching consequences. That said, given that it's also unlikely to help anyone, it's still better if it gets stopped.

5256,"&gt; Turkey has high inflation and a high current account deficit, yes, but it is running a tight fiscal policy...

It _was_ running a reasonably responsible fiscal policy, we don't really know  how it looks now.  They are subsidizing loans (0.98%/month when the CB policy rate is 17.5%) for home buyers across the board, there are other subsidies/loan guarantees whose effects have not yet filtered through and heaven knows how much they're spending for the election (they are now automatically lowering taxes to keep the gas prices constant, for example).  I'm not saying the debt/GDP ratio will double in weeks or anything crazy like that, but fiscal responsibility is gone.  

&gt; It will see some exchange rate adjustment, which is being done by the market, but note that this is not the same as real GDP falling by 20%. Nominal exchange rates are always volatile. PPP-adjusted GDP (which is corrected for these wild swings) should not fall anywhere near that much, in fact should not fall at all.

I think we'll see negative growth for some number of quarters if not a year at some point.  They tried to create growth for the triple elections in 2019 and it destabilized things quite a bit (thus the rushed elections for the president&amp;parliament which have to go together).  If AKP wins the presidency, they'll try to secure the local elections in 2019 as well.  How?  I don't know.  But they won't be keen to do anything to stop growth.

This year we celebrate 100 years, so the centennial, of the unifications from 1918. Obviously, that is usually about holding conferences, gatherings, concerts and what not. The Cultural Institute is promoting the romanian culture and history. It is absolutely normal to have literature about those times, the history from 1918 and maps about that year. The fact your authorities abusively barged in a romanian institution and abusively interpreted the fact some books and maps about the celebrated date and event are ''instigation to separatism'', is a grave abuse and it breaks fundamental rights. The romanian population from Cernauti and Northern Bucovina in general, was always there. They are on their lands, they didn't immigrate there. The fact USSR moved the border to the south in WW2, doesn't mean those people also dissapeared.

This is not the only abuse or disinformation spread in Ukraine about the romanian population in Northern Bucovina and the Romanian Cultural Institute. There were false rumours spead some years ago that the romanians there will proclaim independence, which never happened and nobody planned anything like that. Then there were the attacks on the same institute by ukrainian hooligans and ultranationalists looking for intimidation and provocation. Then there were their marches through the areas where the romanians are the majority, with the exact same purpose. Then the abusive education law that removes romanian from schools and tries to forcibly assimilate the romanians there. Yet, the ukrainian authorities expect the romanians trapped in Ukraine to go to war against the russians and give their lives for Ukraine. 

I can assure you Ukraine is damaging its cause in front of the international opinion with these actions and will never enter the EU or NATO with this attitude. 200 years from now and you'll still be on your own trying to keep the russians back.

5352,"&gt;Could you please tell me what did you exactly expect?

A name for international usage . Why would I expect that the we would need to change the name of the Macedonian Academy of Science and Arts into the Northern Macedonian Academy of Science and Arts or the Macedonian Radio Television to the Northern Macedonian Radio Television . Why would anyone in my country expect this.

&gt; What are you talking about? One aspect of the deal is that you can keep the term 'Macedonian' for internal usage. Also, your example is invalid.

See above ,the name of every institution or organisation that is under the governments control will have to replace Macedonia with Northern Macedonia. I could have also made the example with Great Brittain and French Brittany but decided to give a more simple one.

&gt;Are you kidding? Greece will accept the term 'Northern Macedonia' and will also accept that the UN will list your language as Macedonian, with the sidenote that it is a Slavic language having nothing to do with Ancient Macedonian. We also accept that internally you can call yourselves Macedonians or whatever the hell you like, since no once can force 2 million people to call each other Marty McFly for example.

It was stated originally that there was a clause in the original agreement that you did not have to use the names , i read a official copy and removed that part.

&gt; Look, there's no greater humiliation than pretending to be something that you're clearly not. And that applies to all nationalists in the region, including Greeks. Don't you ever get fucking tired of all the bullshit? Dressing up in silly costumes and waving flags while we're the punchbag of East, West, North and South?

&gt;I also feel this is a slightly bad deal from our point of view, given the fact that I don't see you as 'Macedonian' or your language as such, but in the face of lightning the torches and exchanging threats, I think I'd vote Yes.

The fools that wanted to LARP and went too far is a completely different problem. First some parts were started just out of spite but as the problem kept dragging on and as pressure kept mounting up from all sides Bulgaria,Kosovo ( especially them) and with no escape route in sight people started going too far. But we are neither unique in this aspect nor the biggest offenders. I will not list examples so not to expand the subject here.

&gt; You don't even get many aspects of the problem. A very large number of Greeks, more than your entire country's population identify as 'Macedonians'. When you claim that it's your state's purpose to encompass these people into a 'Greater Macedonia', you expect us to accept this? The products of the three regions (Western, Central and Eastern Macedonia) are labelled as 'Macedonian' just like the products of Crete are labelled 'Cretan' and so on. This is far beyond the stupid statues of Alexander, Phillip or Olympias and the Vergina Sun or just appeasing our 'patriotic feelings'.

And neither did you. Just as the average Greek  thought that this negotiation was being done so that in the end we will not be Macedonians so did the average Macedonian thought that the negotiations were being done so to ONLY find a name to use in international agreements .On our side there was never even a notion that we are negotiating about being Macedonians or the language being Macedonian.On the other hand we never even entertained the possibility about stopping you calling your self Macedonians.

&gt;I don't know what you think but when government changes, the whole of the state's foreign affairs don't change along. Even in Greece. The 'erga omnes national or geographical term' has been the Greek position for the last 3 decades. And again: what do you expect? That the doors of NATO and the EU will be wide-open and when you're in, we'll just have to count on your word that the deal is kept?

I would expect that the deal becomes official for both sides on the same day that we enter EU and NATO at least. Greece and Macedonia already had an agreement that Greece would not interfere with Macedonia joining any institution under F.Y.R.O.M , Greece broke it  there was even an International  court rulling , no one cared at all so excuse me of being skeptical of being tricked in an agreement where Macedonia has to do everything first.

Our law enforcement tries its best. The justice system is somewhat light handed for way to many crimes. Personally I think violent / sexual crimes against victims should be dealt with somewhat harshly.

But if you read thought the sentences it really doesn't make any sense. The guy got 10 years for ""guilty of conspiracy to rape"". This means he didn't actually rape anyone. Though he was planning to. But the guy who did get convicted to rape 3 people gets 12 years. Something there to me just doesn't add up its a whole 2 years difference but the crimes are significantly different.

5371,"&gt; nah I'm not a citizen of nowhere, I'm a citizen of two countries. If you actually read what she said, you'd know she was referring to Brits who claim their citizens of nowhere: I'm not one of them. Nice snide comment.

Naaah, you are just a US citizen who exploits its UK passport to make life easier. Double citizenship is just a way to have one foot in both camps. 

&gt; Haha! They were demanding American-made Feta to be sold in America had to have its name changed.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm not even answering the other part because you're omitting the 800 kg gorilla in the room: the EU demanded the US sold american feta as ""salad cheese"". lol.

lol the EU demanded that if the US producers want to sell their ""food"" in the EU, they respect the same laws as our producers. German or Bulgarian food manufacturers are also forbidden to sell their products as Feta, since they don't use the procedural guidelines which protect the name Feta from counterfeit. Cheeses that do not protected and registered PDOs can be sold without this caveat (mozzarella for example). Again, you just want to be exempt from rules our manufacturers must comply with and you are not giving me any explanation other than we want trade. If you want to sell into our markets, you follow the same rules our companies have. German producers also have to use ""salad cheese"" for their stuff. Why should we give you an exemption?

&gt; Because the US - who for 75% of their history have been the most protectionist country on earth - began rolling back their tariffs explicitly because European leaders promised to do the same - in time - after WW2. The EU has been pretty bad at it. Furthermore, Germany charging a combined 29% tariff on all imported industrial goods is not in the spirit of liberalizing trade. This means a lot because Germany is the EU's biggest economy and by them so brazenly going against the spirit of trade liberalization it sets the tone elsewhere.

Do you have conditions limiting your reading comprehension? I just told you that Germany cannot impose tariffs on its own. Germany is an EU member and a member of the EU customs union, which means that the tariffs applied by all members with regards to extra EU goods are set by the EU, not Germany, not France, not Portugal. Germany CANNOT DECIDE ON ITS OWN which tariffs to apply to extra EU goods and it can't levy tariffs on intra EU goods.

&gt; 
&gt; There is no such thing as German tariffs .
&gt; 
&gt; https://www.gtai.de/GTAI/Navigation/EN/Invest/Investment-guide/The-tax-system/value-added-tax-vat,t=trade-with-noneu-member-states,did=7024.html
&gt; 
&gt; This VAT acts as another tariff in effect. It makes it more expensive to import industrial goods into Germany (i.e Germany's bread-and-butter). Note that the VAT doesn't apply internally within Germany or the EU.

Again, I am seriously doubting your ability to think. You are so blinded by your nationalist fairytale or whatever Trump feeds you that you can't even see that a VAT is not a tariff. Even if we counted VAT as a tariff, which is not, it is only fair to German companies and for the sake of a level playing field. The US does not have a federal VAT and the state ones are ridiculous compared to the EU average. If you are a low tax regime and our companies work in an environment where taxes are higher, not rebalancing the disparity would put us at an unfair disadvantage. Set up a federal VAT rate at around 20%, as most EU states do, and then you can talk.

&gt; Come back when you're not a snide little shit. :)

In terms of Scotland, they’re not listed as reserved powers in the Scotland Act 1998 so are rightfully devolved.

5381,"Oh i fully agree with you that there is no simple solution. Its the first lesson you learn working in the field of migration. 

But a lot of the people currently in Libya for example went there knowing what the situation is in that hellhole. And as long as there are traffickers and people of the same community already in Europe showing their ""success"" people will try. 

What I mainly wanted to point out is that the idea with centers in Africa isn't the silver bullet that some people try to sell it for. The migrational pressure is just too high, especially with numbers like those in Nigeria which will, if they stay on this trajectory, within the next 30 years be larger population wise than the USA. Yet economically speaking even at this point due to multiple reasons the economy can barely sustain the population.  

Also what a lot of people don't realise is that developmental aid often increases migrational pressure since it those migrating are not the poorest of the poorest (those are, with the exception of slave labor/forced prostitution of no interest for human traffickers and such since they can't afford the trip) but the more educated middle class. That is true for most Afghanis arriving in Europe as well actually even though there we're more talking about economic wealth than actual education. 

However I stand to my points regarding pull factors. If you don't you might want to speak with representatives from any eastern european country (Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary to name a few that are actually transit countries to the west).

So far from a benefactor,  China collects twice as much money as it has loaned, and there's even a condition that should Montenegro fail to repay China can even seize some of its territory.

The thing you are talking about would be the Russian connections speculated on recently with Aaron Banks, but you need to keep in mind those come from his own book (not sure he would put that in his book if he got direct money) and the person who handed over emails (the person writing that book) said there was nothing in the emails that went to financing.

Well, this approach to economy proved to be counter-productive, so I suppose that one does not propose it seriously.

&gt; Imagine you work in a blue collar industry where jobs have been moving overseas slowly over the past couple decades. Wouldn't you support tariffs on these industries that will keep your job in place? 

It might help in a short term. In a long term, this approach is counter-productive. Sending aluminum to the US is expensive? Let's process it in place in the EU and send the final product to the US, so the US workers won't have any work at all. Tariffs on ready products too? So in a free market economy, the products of this kind going to be expensive, and workers might keep their positions, but their well-being will decline.

5655,"The new Minister of Culture , Màxim Huerta, defrauded 218,322 euros to the Treasury using a company to collect what he received for participating in the program of Ana Rosa de Telecinco . The fraud detected by the Tax Agency and ratified in May of last year by the Justice corresponds to the fiscal years of 2006, 2007 and 2008. In total, the Treasury claimed to the Huerta 366,000 euros for the fraud.The minister used a system that became widespread in several professional sectors, including communication: creating a society whose sole purpose was to receive the funds paid to the journalist, thus allowing taxation of corporate tax and not income tax. , always more burdensome. In this case, the company created for this purpose by Huerta in 2006 was Almaximo Profesionales de la Imagen SL . This society paid only a ""minimum"" part of what was received by the then journalist and only for that amount did he pay IRPF. In addition, he charged unjustified expenses to society, not being really related to their activity. A few years ago, the Treasury began to pursue this type of system, demanding that everything received by society be subject to IRPF.Hacienda inspected Huerta and found that he had committed three minor tax infractions. He presented two provisional liquidations, one for the year 2006 (of 54,363.10 euros) and another corresponding to the other two years (163,959.65 euros), for a total of 218,322.75 euros. Adding the interests of delay, the amount claimed by Hacienda Huerta was 256,788.47 euros.The Tax Agency also imposed two fines for a total amount of 109,161.38 euros (27,181.55 euros for the first year inspected and 81,979.83 for the second inspection). Thus, the sum total of what was claimed by the Treasury to the minister in concept of fee defrauded, interest and fines amounted to 365,939.85 euros.The journalist did not accept the Treasury thesis and appealed the decision. His appeal was rejected by the Regional Economic Administrative Court of Madrid and ultimately by the Contentious Administrative Chamber of the Superior Court of Justice of Madrid . In May last year, the Supreme Court handed down two judgments -of which El Confidencial has initially reported- that gave the reason to the State Bar in the name of the Treasury.""Although it is legitimate the interposition of professional societies, it is not the creation of companies with the sole purpose of avoiding part of the tax burden without contributing anything to the activity carried out by the only partner, who has constituted them and who administers them"", affirms in one of sentences the Fifth Section of the TSJ. ""It is a society that does not add value to services and that could have been dispensed with and aims to avoid IRPF tax rates,"" he says in another.

47% of the respondents do not believe that it is acceptable for a school teacher to be homosexual. 52% of the respondents do not believe that homosexuality should be legal in Britain. 23% support the introduction of Sharia Law instead of British Law in areas of Britain. How is this not expressive of the overall strength of the desire to have Islamic values implemented? How would you measure it then?

&gt;Censorship has a very specific meaning, and I would argue that voicing poorly supported opinions against religious minorities is far more prevalent in European media than so-called ""self-censorship"" for fear of appearing racist.

Far more prevalent, sure. But that does not mean the answer is silence, when it comes to be being honest about the many issues related to Islam.

And just for the record, regarding the original post you commented on: 
&gt;They want their own culture, norms and values to be implemented in the country they reside.

This is obviously a vast generalization. I am not defending that post. Obviously it is not an either or thing. But if you take a look at specific issues, it is a worryingly large percentage of Muslims, if not the majority, who hold views that are directly antithetical to Western values. 

If the views of Muslims are vastly different on the continent, the survey is obviously only applicable to Britain. But I doubt that very much to be the case.

Turkey has high inflation and a high current account deficit, yes, but it is running a tight fiscal policy, it has low debt and its demographics are damn good compared to most Eastern European countries. It has monetary policy independence. All these are key buffers.

It will see some exchange rate adjustment, which is being done by the market, but note that this is *not* the same as real GDP falling by 20%.  Nominal exchange rates are always volatile. PPP-adjusted GDP (which is corrected for these wild swings) should not fall anywhere near that much, in fact should not fall *at all*. 

I'd just revise downwards some of the growth numbers of the last 6-7 years which are implausibly high, as Meyersson shows.

 - Hong Kong total power consumption per year: [41.7 billion kwh.](https://www.worlddata.info/asia/hong-kong/energy-consumption.php)

 - Hong Kong surface area: [1104 square km.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography_of_Hong_Kong#Area)

 - Power output per square meter of solar panel in full sunlight: [200W](https://www.theecoexperts.co.uk/solar-panels/how-much-electricity)

 - Number of hours of full sunlight per day in Hong Kong: [Looks like about 3.5h on a worst case day.](https://www.altestore.com/howto/solar-insolation-map-world-a43/)

 - Total energy per square meter per year in Hong Kong: 3.5 hours of light per day \* 365 days per year \* 200 watts of output = 255.5kwh

 - Total energy that could be gained per year if we pave over Hong Kong in solar panels: 255.5kwh \* 1104 million square meters = 282 billion kwh.

So no, if you paved over Hong Kong in solar panels you'd generate enough energy to keep it running 6 times over. So even when you take into account losses from storage and the fact that it's impractical to pave over every square meter, it is still completely doable to run Hong Kong on rooftop solar power.

We could on the mission grounds build a separate space used entirely for asylum requests. If we hire additional workers that job it will not put any burden on the primary mission of an embassy.

And obviously there's not need for all embassies to offer that service, just in a few like in Libya, essentially the countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea.

That way migrants / refugees will get their verdict locally, which removes the incentive to use smugglers. It saves the petitioners money, so they don't waste their families money (which is often the case). We evade the huge issue of having people inside the EU we cannot deport because we don't know / can't prove where they are from.

5836,"&gt; Well, parts of our Muslim society might allow it. 

And parts of Catholic society tolerate pedophile priests - neither case should create problems for our legal systems, because the notion we'll tolerate pedophilia is insane fearmongering. 

&gt; These immigrants don't adopt Dutch culture, they live next to us in parallel societies. 

You're right, hence the need for strong integration measures and a societal tolerance towards more weird shit like not outright insulting Muslims by pointlessly cheering for right winger ''insult Islam'' days.

&gt; And as European peoples start to dwindle, perhaps we will see such a future. Who knows.

This just reeks of defeatism, for of all - we won't dwindle, our ethnic make-up might change, but, again, that's where integration and assimilation comes in. Stop treating these people like untouchable, unintegratable animals, and you can start working for the future.

&gt;  It is of course however important to note that pedophilia is not really okay in most Muslim societies.

As it's not among Catholics as well, obviously, however I support completely the notion that regressive and insane fringe ideas should be addressed in religions.

5998,"And that is a valid stand. It's how humans have lived for a very long time. 

My problem is that when women become the ones who generally take care of the family they become less reliable as a work force. Employers know when hiring a woman that everytime a kid is sick, she will be the one who stay at home and care for it. She might be gone for long periods to give birth and care for toddlers. Spending salary, education and promotions on her would be economically stupid when you have an equally compentent male, who will never stay at home to care for the family. Women become second hand choice at pretty much any company.

Now, this is still not a problem to a lot of people and I understand that. If you prefer traditional gender roles this is perfectly fine. What I see as a problem is that this limits the freedom of many women. Not only will the man be the money-earner, and thus the one ""in charge"", but also women who do not like the traditional gender roles will be forced to comply as she will be subjected to the same societal structure as the other women. As long as a large majority of women are fine with the traditional gender roles, nothing needs to be changed. But as history has shown, a large part of modern society women ended up not being fine and wanted change. Being half the population, it is hard not to justify great societal changes to cater this new need.

And this is basically why I am a male feminist. If you have any questions, feel free to ask them.",Sweden,/r/europe/comments/8qhwau/the_gender_paradox_of_the_nordic_welfare_state/e0l8mmz/,BatusWelm,1528874869
