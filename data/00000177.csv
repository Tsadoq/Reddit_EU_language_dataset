0,"&gt;Scotland hasn't been a country for 400 years it's just a region of the UK

setting aside the hazy math, regions don't usually have borders and legal systems of their own


&gt;Maybe there is just a culture of England liking change and Scotland not so much.

Yes you can see that culture of liking change from having a royal sign every bill of parliament to make it a law. Exemplary modern democracy, well done.

&gt;Weird thing about Scotland is that in the original referendum to join the EU they were the least supportive 

I think you're confusing Scotland with msheard tales of Orkney and the Shetlands though *they* are regions *of* Scotland.

I don't mean to sound forward but are you ok? You sound a bit, peevish.

18,"By the time negotiations in France begun nobody wanted another wave of news of mass crimes from Kosovo from Milošević and his butchers.

European and US leaders had very clear picture by that time from intelligence sources about mass atrocities by Serb forces all around former Yugoslavia and they were well informed that most of serbian leadership is facing trials for most henious crimes anyway.

Even more so they knew that he knows that too and that his manouvering space is very limited.

So they presented Milošević with clear choice of take it or leave it with consequences for his entire country if he does not comply. 

He decided to sacrifice his own people for having hold on power till the end being perfectly aware that stepping down means his literal death in prison or by the angry mob which he let down with lost wars and economic wasteland.

Textbook dictatorial behaviour blaming everyone and ""giving everything to the people"" against ""foreign enemies"" and iridentists. 

Sad part is that most of serbs went along with it blaming NATO and everyone else for their national disasters but least of all themselves.

It is not possible he would have stayed in power for decades and have enough support for his wars without wider support from serbs.

Every time Slobodan called for meat for his exporting wars serb would stand in the line swallowing his propaganda like hot chocolate.

That argument always seemed so stupid to me.  I used to know a guy who got skin cancer on the top of his ear, but no one says 'cut off babies' left ear to half their chance of ear cancer.'

Of course, if you remove tissue, there's less chance of that tissue getting a cancerous cell development.  You could literally make that exact same argument about removing any piece of the body.

143,"&gt; WTF is she supposed to do? Disregard the democratic process and its results? Just because the tantrums are thrown around?

How would she be disregarding the democratic process and its results? The whole point of democracy is that people are able to choose for themselves, and that their opinions can change. We're approaching 3 years since the Brexit referendum and Brexit still hasn't happened, don't you think it's possible that the general opinion surrounding Brexit could change dependant on how things have gone so far? What about the fact that many young voters were unable to participate in the referendum but could now? Shouldn't they have some input on a massive decision that would impact their futures? I would argue that the conditions under which the vote was held were questionable to begin with, and the result itself (52:48) was too divisive to mean much other than a second referendum being necessary.

&gt; And now there is that petition. Whoever came up with the idea is a total idiot, as shortsighted, or even worse than Cameron. If successful, this would basically mean the end of British democracy. **How can you have a major national vote and then say ""nah, foggetit"".**

This sounds disingenuous to me. You can't seriously believe that this petition could get article 50 revoked on the spot? That isn't the point, it's an expression of dissatisfaction and as a whole is more likely communicate to MPs/Parliament that people aren't content with the vote above anything else. I'll agree that the petition should instead be asking for a second referendum, but the difference is so minor that I genuinely think you're faking outrage over this.

144,"&gt;Still, the US is not going to be nicer to the UK than it's going to be to the EU.

&amp;#x200B;

Yeah we would. The US doesn't care what the UK's domestic law is. It has nothing to do with being nice, it's a free trade deal both ways in the EU and with a US free trade deal. You're just saying words. 

&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;In such a deal scenario, they'd have to adopt US rules and standards

Maybe, depends on the deal, they could leave lots of shit out. Most rules and standards have the same result, they just have different technical differences. ***You think Canada and the US have all the same rules and standards for everything?*** No.  

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The UK has 10% of the GDP of the EU or of the USA. A no-deal brexit  without any other trade deals would mean a minor recession in the EU and  a major one in the UK. Any UK trading partner knows that. Such a danger  is the shittiest position to do deals from.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not saying it's their best idea. They're better off than in the EU just because the EU is way closer than the US is and they do more trade.

What she did instead was to try to wait until the last moment to present a compromise she knew would be unpopular, then try to scare people into accepting it by threatening both sides with a worse outcome (a second referendum for leavers and no-deal for remainers).

Fox and Crabb went out in the first round of voting by Tory MPs, Gove in the second and then Leadsom withdrew. You are right in your description of who backed May - broadly remain supporting MPs.

Gove was kicked out of the cabinet immediately. He went back to his job at the Mail. Boris was the worst FS in living memory. He spent most of his time making trouble for May, singing racist poems, insulting world leaders and endangering British citizens whilst doing little actual work. It was widely acknowledged that if a foreign leader wanted someone from the FO to talk to, they'd go to Alan Duncan who is competent. Davies was wholly unprepared to negotiate Brexit and ended up designating most of his responsibilities to his civil servants - when he quit, he claimed that the deal he had been responsible for arguing for was so bad, he couldn't support it.

It's not, Czechia's trade policy focus is different to that of Germany's. Czechia doesn't focus on export, Czechia focuses on investment inflow into the country. The incoming capital boosts development in the country.

&gt;Czechia is a small country with extremely open economy and is therefore largely dependent on what happens outside its borders.

Exactly, hence why a locally-suited monetary policy is important. Czechia is a small country with a small economy, Germany is a big country with a big economy. Two different environments for business, two different policy styles.

599,"&gt;The US never had a military coup. The civil war began when the elected local American legislatures in the South voted to secede from the US. Then the army peacefully split and southern soldiers went to join the new southern army while soldiers from the north stayed in the northern army. Then there was peace for a few months before fighting finally broke out.

&gt;But at all times both armies were under control of civilian governments.

That peace didn't last however, and the South did attack a fort, if I remember correctly. It was a form of treason, even if reprisals against former confederate officials were avoided to allow for the healing of the union. You're right however that it wasn't a military coup, but it was the closest example I could think of.

&gt;Newburgh conspiracy

That's interesting, I didn't know that. 

&gt;You can even read the speech Washington gave here to see exactly what I’m talking about. Washington was basically an anti-Napoleon. He’s not famous for being a great general, he’s famous for being very humble and principled.

Napoleon, Maurice Challes and Pétain are a few examples of powerful generals who did/attempted putsches.

&gt;So my point is that Washington is the father of the country. It would take an almost incredible amount of hubris to launch a coup after 240 years of American history without a coup.

True, most democracies which die due to military coups are very young, and the US has been in the business for a long time. I would caution however that it doesn't make a military coup impossible, ""price of liberty is eternal vigilance', and all that.

Three British warships including the destroyer Swift, as well as the ocean liner Cassandra, aided the stricken vessel and assisted in transferring stranded passengers back to shore.

1. I've been working on re-forestation project in the Amazon, and I can tell you that by far the number one cause of deforestation (hence the mass-killing of local species) is kettle farming. It's over 90% the reason for deforestation. Cows need vast territory as well as you need vast territory to grow vegetables to feed them. 

2. Plant based food would require less than 1/10th of the land we currently use for agriculture. In the USA 95% of the corn produced (and think of all the Mexican food that requires corn) is being fed to the animals. 

3. General rule of thumb. About 100kg of plants are used to ""create"" 1kg of meat. We waste 99kg of food to get at tiny bit of meat.

4. Look up water contamination slaughterhouses

5. Look up methane and the number of cows we have on Earth

6. Look up the total land mammal mass on Earth. The percentage of wild land mammals have decreased to only 4%. All the rest is humans and the animals we grow to kill.

7. I don't see how we would kill more species by using the fraction of the land we currently use now for farming, when we could give back all these lands to the nature and stop destroying our remaining bits of rainforests. 

I have traveled over 70 countries and I have seen with my own eyes the devastating consequences of the oil and meat industry. It's about time we act and have common sense and not be frustrated by the naming of the products but by the amount of nature we destroy/ed. 

8. Related to this: look up the water, energy and land needs of plants versus meat / dairy products. If that's not convincing enough by its own I don't know what is. ",,/r/europe/comments/b2vl7o/mcdonalds_testing_vegan_chicken_nuggets_in_norway/ej9tire/,fan_tas_tic,1553442836

&gt;Having the USA as a trade partner with Trump as president.... It's going to be chaotic you can't trust Trump he changes his mind every second and Trump only things about his benefits. 

Not sure where you get that idea but those two things can't be true at the same time. Either he changes his mind every second or he only thinks about how he would benefit. Let's just say, for argument, that he only thinks about how he benefits. That's what any good negotiator is supposed to do. They're supposed to come away with all sides winning. No good business transaction happens without all parties being satisfied. You wouldn't just go into a store and hand the teller money without receiving goods or services in return, would you?

Trump may seem chaotic but in reality he is a pragmatic and hard-nosed negotiator, which is a stark contrast to Teresa May, who seems reasonable but in reality is a weak-willed puddle of jelly. At this juncture, the UK really needs a hard-nosed negotiator to get you folks out of the abusive relationship that is the EU.

Do you think they would invite Denmark to this hypothetical European Security Council? No, they would just model it according the UN model where only the big and powerful countries would have the final say.

Germany and France simply aren't willing to hand over the power over defence or foreign policy to some supranational authority. Germany preaches multilateralism, but does not show any intention to honour it when it comes to their own interests, as the entire Eastern Europe can see on the NS2 example. They pushed it over the heads of Poland, Ukraine and the Baltics and then fought as much as possible to avoid any EU oversight over the project.

And of course they have also shown that they are perfectly capable to complain about Trump and the US and their attitude to NATO, but at the same time, they are also perfectly happy letting the US being the primary player securing Eastern NATO flank. France doesn't even have anyone in the Baltics which kinda shows clearly what interests they have in defending the region, Germany has troops in Lithuania, but at the same time, it undermines NATO through its open refusal to increase defence spending and through the whole NS2 project. So on the other hand, they shit talk Trump because his rhetorics undermine NATO while at the same time, they are even worse because in their case, it's not rhetorics, it's their actual actions.",Czech Republic,/r/europe/comments/b4imvp/france_is_prepared_to_extend_its_nuclear/ej9k40e/,kristynaZ,1553435615

747,"I can tell you:

When you have countries that equal standards of living and the value of their work is the same, you can truly have an economic pact amongst equals. At that point you can have a fair division of labor and everyone has a fair chance of getting a good job. 

But when you have countries with different histories and different levels of development, an open economic system does not benefit the workers that live within the wealthier countries. Their cost of labor is too much and people from lower-cost countries have a massive advantage. They are much more in demand. 

Let's open up this example to the world level to highlight what I mean. I've been looking for side work on sites like Upwork. I'm an IT guy and my labor is worth a certain amount where I live. I look on upwork and see that the vast majority of IT workers are living in India and charging prices that I cannot possibly compete with. Many are willing to work below what would be the minimum wage where I live. 

So it becomes a non-starter. Most Americans and Europeans would have no place there. The few who are really good at selling themselves might, but they're at a tremendous disadvantage compared to equally intelligent people in India who are willing to work for $5 an hour. 

Now back to Europe. People in an expensive country like England are going to find themselves in a similar situation when it comes to labor from Eastern Europe. If you happen to work in a field where jobs are temporary (such as a house remodelers, bricklayers, landscapers, IT contractors, etc) you're going to find it hard to compete against a guy who is coming from Poland or Romania. 

The laws can state that everyone is entitled to the same wage, but this is impossible from an economic perspective. The ""going rate"" for a job is determined by what people are willing to work for. And if you have a supply of cheap labor willing to work for a low rate, that will decrease the ""going rate"" for that job.",,/r/europe/comments/b4tu45/one_of_the_best_signs_from_yesterdays_peoples/ej9ke80/,ManBearPig2024,1553435863

In 1993, investigative reporter and Pulitzer Prize–winning journalist Roy Gutman accused Mackenzie of having two trips to Washington D.C., one to speak in front of the Heritage Foundation and the other to appear as an expert witness for the House of Representatives Armed Services Committee, funded by SERBNET, a Serbian-American lobbyist group. In a telephone interview with Gutman, MacKenzie responded, ""It wouldn't surprise me if there was some Serbian involvement considering who initiated the contract; however I would be very disappointed if that were the case.""[10] The day after the interview, an article appeared in Newsday suggesting that MacKenzie was on the Serbian payroll. When MacKenzie confirmed the source of the funds was indeed SERBNET, he donated the entire fee to the Canadian Federation of Aids Research (CANFAR).However, UN officials ultimately criticised his ""lack of judgment"" in the matter.

&gt;""You won't get very ""fast"" if you use fluorides. They moderate too much.""

&gt;...

&gt;There are some real challenges to this approach, the first one being finding the right mixture of chloride salts to achieve it. Ideally you want a monochloride-tetrachloride-trichloride salt mixture. This will help you achieve low melting points in your chloride salt mixture. 

&gt;...

 &gt;for the U/Pu approach, you'd ideally want a salt like

&gt;NaCl - UCl4 - PuCl3

&gt;and this salt is pretty tough to run with because UCl4 would rather be UCl3. But you *need* it to be UCl4. From what I understand, Terrapower has run into a fair amount of trouble with this, and the latest I've heard is that they have abandoned their plan to use a NaCl - UCl4 - UCl3 salt mixture.

874,"The problem with this entire thing, imo, is that Britain is unilaterally fucked no matter what happens because we've had an incompetent government since before Blair, maybe. The deal May put forward without consulting anyone (to my knowledge) or even thinking of a plan before triggering A50 is one that'd effectively do nothing but remove any say we had in rules, which is why the House keeps shooting it down.

There has been misdirection on both sides of it: implying that the EU was taking more than we could give while the PM was wearing diamond-encrusted fucking shoes, millions were homeless and they were selling off our industry to China and god knows who else, and then blaming immigration on many of our social issues was asinine, but so was pretending the EU was 1000% on-track. Wanting a combined army is a step too far for many people, myself included. We were vetoing that every time it came up, and now we're leaving it has a chance of going ahead. From what I understand, a lot of changes are made without reading the text if Voss' reaction to Article 13 was anything to go on. We (read: all member states) could have changed these things and made it much better off for everyone concerned.

I personally don't know what on Earth to think about all this; I don't like some things the EU does, but I don't find myself complaining about it too much, and didn't want Britain to leave it; the ship's course is listing a bit for everyone's liking, but having 28 countries coming together to stop bad things happening is better than a parliament making decisions without listening to the populace. I've been really angry about it on Reddit over the past couple days or so and it's odd to read, looking back.

just to illustrate our government's incompetence to you, since you might not have kept track of what was happening until Brexit:

This moment in time is the only time I've been ashamed to be British. We look like absolute fools, and I suppose a good chunk of us are in some form or another. We're open season for any predatory trade deal any other country wishes to make because we've just shown everyone on earth and the handful orbiting it that we've no fucking clue what we're doing. The only upside to the entire thing is that our government's incompetence is on full display, not just to ourselves who no matter the vote will be furious, but to the EU who hopefully have some form of sympathy for those of us who didn't vote for this. Hopefully we actually get a party that will run the country forward instead of into the ground.

Erm, there was a big difference in life expectancy depending on if you said yes or no to the Mongol empire. They were heavyweight champions when it came to conquest, killing, raping and not washing were clothes. Over 16 million men or 1 in 200 men are claimed to be direct descendants of Genghis Khan himself. In 2003, an evolutionary geneticist named Chris Tyler-Smith discovered that 8 percent of men across 16 different ethnic populations in Asia shared a common Y-chromosome pattern with Genghis Khan. The mongols are in the top 5 when it comes to empire building so probably not the best comparison to use if you are trying to make the Spanish look like a load of ""goody two shoes"".

""The pigment used to produce this prized paint was ultramarine, itself made from the mineral lapis lazuli. As the name ‘ultramarine’ suggests, this came to Europe from ‘beyond the sea’ - Afghanistan, to be exact, which explains why the colour blue was such an expensive rarity. That all changed with the introduction of one of the first synthetic pigments, coming out of Germany in the early 1700s, called Prussian blue.

The discovery of Prussian blue is credited to a German paint maker called Diesbach. As the story goes, he was trying to make a red pigment using the shells of the cochineal beetle, but contamination meant he ended up with something blue. The value of this new pigment was immediately obvious, especially when it was shown to be stable and relatively insensitive to light. It was a sensation, not least because the new pigment was much cheaper. It was soon being sold around Europe with the patriotic names of Preußisch Blau and Berlinish Blau, and was even exported to the Japan, where painters and woodblock artists were also in need of a long lasting blue pigment.""",,/r/europe/comments/b4qof7/big_ben_restored_to_its_original_colours_prussian/ej98ki1/,iseetheway,1553421327

&gt; Legal barriers: Legal rights can provide opportunity to monopolise the market in a good. 

That's not a monopoly. A monopoly is a situation where there is only one vendor for a particular type of product or service. Being the only one able to sell your product/service is not a monopoly.

&gt; Intellectual property rights, including patents and copyrights, give a monopolist exclusive control of the production and selling of certain goods. 

Again, the above is not a monopoly.

For example, the Windows O/S can only be sold by Microsoft, but that is not a monopoly. It would be a monopoly if there wasn't another operating system available.

&gt; Property rights may give a company exclusive control of the materials necessary to produce a good.""

The above has nothing to do with copyright. Property rights are onwership rights and Ownership is what our current western civilization is based on. Abolishing ownership means Socialism/Communism, which is unenforceable in practice.

I'm serious, you _must_ get out on large scales and literally make your politicians afraid enough so that their actions look undeniably like they are committed to staying in the EU.",,/r/europe/comments/b4irot/pulling_out_never_works/ej954j7/,space-throwaway,1553415342

1082,"Translation if needed :

On 24 March 1999, Western countries dropped their first bombs on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, reduced to Serbia and Montenegro since 1992. For the first time in its history, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) was at war with a sovereign country that threatened neither its neighbours nor any of its members. Initiated without a UN mandate and on the pretext of the failure of the Rambouillet negotiations, the bombings lasted until 3 June. After the destruction of many infrastructures, President Slobodan Milošević eventually gave in to Western demands for the predominantly Albanian-speaking region of Kosovo: withdrawal of Serb forces, deployment of an international force and return of refugees.

From the first clashes in spring 1987 between the Albanian authorities then governing this autonomous region and the Serb minority, Milošević had adopted a nationalist rhetoric to conquer power and then remain there. Becoming head of the League of Communists of Serbia the same year, then president of that republic in 1989, he abolished the autonomous status of the region within a moribund Yugoslav Federation, before mobilizing the federal army to defend the Serb minorities by trying to stop the march towards independence of Slovenia, Croatia and then Bosnia and Herzegovina.

The siege of Sarajevo and the abuses of the Bosnian-Serb militias of Radovan Karadžić - who had just been sentenced on appeal to life imprisonment for crimes against humanity - rendered Serbian claims inaudible. In 1995, Milošević had to bury Greater Serbia's dream by signing the Dayton Agreement (United States), ending the Bosnian war with a confederal solution. But he was still holding Kosovo with an iron fist. Disengaged from power in a region where they represent nearly nine out of ten inhabitants, Kosovo Albanians were relying less and less on the civil disobedience advocated by their historic leader Ibrahim Rugova to regain their freedom. The spring 1998 insurgency under the leadership of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), inspired by Enver Hoxha's autarkic communism (leader of Albania from 1945 to 1985), triggered fierce repression.

In response to the use of force, Westerners denounced Serbian intransigence, did not shrink from any exaggeration of the situation on the ground, presented as ""genocide"", even if it meant putting forward false news relayed by many media. The publication on the website of Le Monde diplomatique of the content of the Rambouillet agreements showed, however, that inflexibility was not always on the expected side: the Serbs accepted in particular an autonomous government, free elections and the release of all political prisoners. But the Westerners wanted to impose the presence of troops under NATO command. What they could not win through negotiation, they obtained through war, at the cost of the displacement of hundreds of thousands more refugees, numerous ""collateral damages"" affecting civilians, and many crimes, still unpunished, of KLA leaders.

The campaign was led militarily by US General Wesley Clark (future Democratic nomination candidate in 2004) and Spanish Socialist Javier Solana, NATO Secretary General, and was led politically by the finest of the ""Western Left"". US Democratic President William Clinton could count on the support of the major European countries, all governed by social democrats: Anthony Blair in the United Kingdom, Gerhard Schröder in Germany, Massimo D'Alema in Italy and Lionel Jospin in France.

Twenty years later, NATO now includes Slovenia, Croatia and Montenegro and still maintains troops locally. Located near the capital Pristina, Camp Bondsteel, one of the largest U.S. bases in Europe, was also used as a place of detention and interrogation during the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. In 1999, hundreds of thousands of Kosovars were fleeing the war. In the spring of 2017, tens of thousands fled poverty. Despite Western benevolence, Kosovo's economy never took off. Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita remains the lowest in the region, unemployment affects 31% of the population (including one in two young people) and the trade deficit reaches 38% of GDP. The only dynamic elements are the informal economy (at least one third of GDP) and remittances from migrants working in Western Europe.

1086,"Geopolitically, the Kosovo war marked the height of a unipolar world - under American domination - that emerged from the end of the Cold War. It has established NATO as a ""global policeman"", operating in Afghanistan, Darfur, Iraq, Libya, the Horn of Africa or Macedonia, far from its original purpose: ""to provide security in the North Atlantic region"". President Donald Trump has even just mentioned Brazil's accession...

Reaffirmed at the expense of Serb minorities during the conflicts in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, the principle of respect for territorial integrity was violated first in practice and then with the Western recognition of Kosovo's independence, proclaimed in February 2008. Vladimir Putin, who came to power in August 1999, will have vivid memories of the humiliation suffered by Russian diplomacy during the conflict, particularly the Western double talk. Six months after Kosovar independence, and on the occasion of the conflict with Georgia, Russia recognized the full sovereignty of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. President Putin will also use this precedent to justify the annexation of Crimea in March 2014.

The redrawing of the region's borders on essentially ethnolinguistic and religious grounds could be further developed with the ongoing negotiations between Belgrade and Pristina. Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić no longer hides the fact that he would be willing to recognize Kosovo in exchange for territorial counterparts, while his counterpart Hashim Thaçi hopes to integrate the Albanians of Serbia into his country. Such an agreement would confirm the end of a fruitful and centuries-old cohabitation in the Balkans. For minorities in Bosnia, Macedonia or the autonomous region of Vojvodina in Serbia, he would open a new Pandora's box.

1262,"&gt; The issues that brought up Brexit are present across Europe. The UK leaving just shuffles those problems under the rug until they cause massive problems further down the road

Not really. A couple of them are, but most of the issues that led people to vote leave are specific to UK only.

We don't really have an issue with intra EU immigration as you do in the UK. It's almost never brought up. You won't find the hatred directed towards Poles, Romanians (apart from gypsies), Bulgarians, etc in Germany (whose Polish diaspora is much bigger), France, Spain (where a substantial majority of Romanians lived pre financial crisis), etc.

We don't really question the ability of the EU to negotiate favourable trade agreements with third party countries. In fact, brexit is a blessing in this regard, as the UK was the main sponsor of the TTIP, while it was deeply unpopular on the continent.

We don't rant about paying into the EU cohesion funds, not in Germany, France, etc or in the Netherlands or Sweden (which are bigger contributors per capita than the UK), although there are legitimate criticisms at the way some members allow misuse of funds. There is way more awareness that the payments to the EU are a fraction of the ROI we get from participating into the single market.

We are fully aware that the EU was never, contrary to credence in the UK, just a free trade bloc. In fact, it was designed since its foundation in 1957 as a community of nations determined to create an ever closer union. 

The only issue that is shared with some Nordic countries and with the Netherlands is the ever closer union principle and what it means. And even there, it is almost the only one objecting in some issues. For example, neither the Netherlands nor Sweden or even Finland have opted out of PESCO. The enhanced cooperation of EU member armies is not described in apocalyptic terms as it is by British media and commentators.

&gt; Furthermore losing the UK from the EU is a serious blow to the EU's credibility and influence, people can pretend otherwise but they are kidding themselves.

Influence, yes. Credibility, no. Surely losing a member of the size of the UK is a loss, but not in terms of credibility, as brexit has demonstrated that the EU is capable of sticking to its principles and hold steady against smear campaigns, attempts to critically compromise its founding principles, and get behind its members in need (i.e. Ireland). Given its past performances in the sovereign debt crisis and in the management of the migrant crisis, there were very few of us that would have bet on the EU to show such a united front. It remains to be seen if such a demonstration of unity and intents is a one time occurrence and/or if it's due to the EU being confronted with a counterpart completely out of its depth.

The difference between Net Neutrality in the US that'd make people people more to watch YouTube or Netflix videos in 1080 or 4K vs the never-ending laundrylist of laws the EU has already passed and still continues to pass is sad. The reactions are sad. American websites from Wikipedia to Netflix and YouTube to Reddit took major actions to make it into a thing. Meanwhile with every EU law that passes on European websites, it's mostly not mentioned at all or if it is it's by users and not the actual platform itself and if the platform does do it it's faint and only a few do it. 

&amp;#x200B;

What baffles me is so many people here on Reddit, I'm not referring to the average European adult but rather the edgy uni crowd are the very ones that embrace all of these new laws and think that the internet should be significantly more regulated. More red tape, more laws, more more more. When other countries stifle the internet in any fashion elsewhere, we all look at them in disgust but also concern for how it might hurt us in the future. When we do it, it's glorious! Best thing ever! Why isn't the entire world copying after the goddess EU?

&gt;Are there any other matters in the UK that require such supermajority? Why do you feel entitled to ignoring the vote of the simple majority? What other matters in your opinion _should_ require supermajority? Does the requirement for supermajority need its own referendum, requiring supermajority?


A) yes, it is required to dissolve the house of commons for a snap election.  
B) Most matters aren't put to the public, so it is a null point really.  But anything that is important enough to need public intervention should require a supermajority or a revote; if nothing else, it's puts the matter to bed.


&gt;More importantly, on what basis do you think you're unassailably ""right"" about your opinion that the UK should remain? Just because the telly told you so?

What I was saying was that if remain doesn't get 60% it should go back to the another referendum.  You're so busy looking for a fight and seeing this as about ""winning"" you aren't paying any attention. Stop trying to ""win"", this isn't sport.  
We should stop trying to black and white this issue and seek a position to maximize the average happiness (this should always be the objective).  To me, this is likely some form of deal.

I would also like to point out that, if we were a direct democracy, we wouldn't be electing a president in the first place... so I'm not entirely sure that this is a proper and fully coherent response to /u/andrewcull's point.

1540,"While you do have a point that the rich does indeed have a disproportional amount of power in the EU, that is not isolated to the EU it is true for any government, national or international.

I agree that the EU has problems, I feel that it has expanded too fast to wards the east, and believe it was a mistake.

I also do feel that EU politicians sometimes are too far removed from the reality of daily life and makes stupid decisions, well I see it more like they make an awesome decision one day and and a terrible decision or motion is put forward the next, an example is the GDPR followed soon after with the current article 11/13 nonsense.

Despite all of that, the way I see it, the EU is CRITICAL for the individual countries of Europe not to be crushed under the boot of the US/China or Russia, together we are strong, separated we are weak.

The EU will never be a perfect fit for everyone, that is not possible, but it is WAY better than trying to fight for good deals as a smaller nation, by jan 2018, the EU had about 514 million citizens, this makes us a bigger market than the US by far, which gives us a lot of power on the international stage.

The UK had about 66 million people in 2017, that is slightly more than a tenth of the market the current combined EU have, sure there are different types of markets, so it is not a completely fair comparison.

They would probably love to just throw their hands in the the air and shout fuck it but it would massively undermines the future of British politics. Hell, May was a remainer so she is literally working her ass off for something she doesn't want, showing how important it is to follow this through to the end. I don't think there can be much argument for what has to be done into his regard.

The point of contention for a few of the people I know who voted to leave but now wish to remain (there aren't that many up here) is that they didn't really know what a leave would entail. They were sold grand images of huge savings to the NHS, better controls for immigration and less access for foreign fishing boats in our waters to name a few benifits offered on our departure. Most of these have been proven to be heavily exaggerated if bot out right lies. So they argue that they are now a lot better informed interns of what it could mean for the future of the country going forward. I personally feel that both sides were equally as bad at misinformation. I think that was mostly down to they themselves not (and still not) knowing what it ultimately means and making up what they thought was needed to gain their side victory. 

All in all not a great story for British politics.

1569,"First of all, referendums not being legally binding is not a new thing. Everyone knew that he didn’t have to abide by what he said (which was kind of a running thing with Cameron, but that’s the story of another referendum). That’s not a dictatorship.

As to why have it? Honestly, search me. If it was my decision, there never would have been a referendum. It was a ridiculous thing to do, because the average man on the street didn’t have nearly enough information (on either side) in advance to allow them to make an informed decision. I suspect it was a way of trying to stop the Tories haemorrhaging members to UKIP and nothing more. As demonstrated by the clusterfuck since, they didn’t think they’d win, or they’d have had a plan in place before they started; it was just a way to pacify the eurosceptics in the party and let Bojo make his run at PM.

However, to address your second point, a lot of the information that the Leave campaign put out has since proven to be false, and they’ve also been fined by the Electoral Commission for breaking electoral law. It’s not unreasonable, therefore, to think that at least some of those 33 million people voted under the influence of lies they’d been told by the Leave campaign. Not all of them, maybe not even a majority of them, but some. There were people the morning after the election saying they’d voted Leave as a protest, but didn’t expect Leave to win (these people are the real fucking numpties if you ask me). There were also people who voted Leave in good faith expecting we’d have a decent plan of attack by now, fucking six days before the original deadline, which we obviously don’t. 

If you vote in a general election and your party turns out to be full of shit, you get another chance to vote differently in a few years. This isn’t like that. This will affect the next several decades of life in this country, maybe more. There are people who voted Leave who have already died, there are people who will die before a deal gets sorted, there are people who will die before the fallout afterwards fully makes itself clear, and there are people too young to vote whose first thirty years of life have been completely decided for them. That’s why people are angry, scared, and want to make their voices heard. If you don’t feel the same, that’s fine, but UKIP were at the anti-Europe stuff for years, and Remainers have  just as much a right to voice their thoughts in peaceful protest.

1701,"While I don't outright disagree with that statement, it's worth noting the main reason France built up its own nuclear arsenal independently from NATO was because the involvement of the US, should the USSR invade Western Europe, was absolutely not as guaranteed as claimed, due to the direct repercussions at stake for the US should they retaliate. Which is understandable.

The US could safely get fully involved along its allies in WW2 because it was traditional warfare, and because there was an entire ocean shielding them from the battlegrounds. It's entirely unrealistic to imagine Germany (or Japan) assaulting continental US, let alone invade it.

The advent of nukes, however, changed everything. The US territory became directly threatened with mass destruction. And it suddenly raised a very important question: would you risk your entire country to be devastated and your own population virtually annihilated, only to prevent some remote countries from being invaded? The answer wasn't, and still isn't as straightforward as you'd expect.

In this regard, it's especially important to consider that, if wars can be triggered by the slightest incident, unlawful invasions can also happen without any kind of formar war being declared. The Crimea annexation should be a good enough reminder of this.

My point being, the Cold War was a mess, standing on a very delicate balance of power, filled with uncertainties on either sides of the fence, with many, *many* factors contributing to the preservation of the status quo. The presence of US nukes on European soil was one of them. But not the only one.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/b4imvp/france_is_prepared_to_extend_its_nuclear/ej7jar3/,Orravan_O,1553363404

I know what you are trying to say, but we are talking about different things here. Just because a bill is proposed out of public opinion made clear through a referendum, doesn't somehow mean that that referendum is legally binding. Again, parliament is the only sovereign body in a parliamentary democracy. It is not up to parliament to implement the wishes of the majority of the populace, even if that populace is the basis of its power. Although, again, of course most bills are based upon public opinion (Since that's generally the start of the policy cycle in democracies).

Back to your comment about the bill. A policy cycle is not a linear process, as it can be broken off, or amended at pretty much any stage. To suggest that a bill is passed and that it should be implemented at any cost, even though it is clear that it will not have a desirable effect, is, quite frankly, ludicrous, and not how a parliamentary democracy should work.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/b4llpf/a_banner_at_the_proeu_march_in_london_where_one/ej7ke7n/,CometBath,1553364133

Good. Maybe the state should scale back if can't offer all those services. This example is quite absurd imo and reflects perfect the wrong attitude some have towards the state. Is not its job to offer all those services. The state is usually inefficient, the less it has to do the better. There are a few things state can't delegate to private (monopoly on violence and all it comes with it: military, police, judicial system), and some things that need to be covered by state because private is not interested due to big number of years to recoup the investments (infrastructure for example, at least part of it). On top of that there are a few things that define in what kind of society we want to leave (education and health care are best examples. Private can do those, just not for everyone and this is important for the society we want, all citizens to be educated and not savages).

1931,"&gt;I think this effect is being severely underestimated by some of the UK's politicians.

By some sure. Those pushing for a chaotic exit certainly.

&gt;The UKs largest partner outside the EU is the US. Its largest exports to the US are again, Cars, Medicaments and Power generators All rely on the EU supply chain.

Again, they aren't reliant on it, they are currently intertwined because EU suppliers have a massive advantage in terms of access to the UK economy, the question is what happens when the UK leaves. The EU loses preferential access, the UK opens up more than the EU can to non-EU economies.. That makes it (relatively) harder for EU firms to compete and means that UK manufacturers have broader options in terms of suppliers.. And that seems to be the way the UK is thinking based on the most recent tariff proposals. The UK is looking to reduce the cost of bringing components for non-EU members, and increase the cost of bringing in finished goods..

&gt;An optimist from the EU side would say, EU companies can pick up the lost UK's trade however its more likely an Asian or local company will step in and both the parts supplier in the EU and the maunfacturer in the UK will suffer

Either is possible, but this sort of highlights one of the issues with the EU as a block at the moment. For example, the UK was against steel tariffs on China, because the UK benefits massively more from imported cheap steel than it does from local production. The EU as a block however benefits more from being able to limit inbound steel and effectively promote EU steel in EU production (it's more expensive, but the large manufacturers also have a currency advantage being in the Eurozone..)..

Exports are a relatively small part of the UK economy, the biggest buyers of UK produced goods are UK companies and individuals. That means that there is a large market that has previously provided a significant preferential access to EU producers and supply chains that may well be looking to open that out. For the UK, it's not just about importing a part from Germany to build a machine, and export it to Australia, indeed for every machine going to Australia there are many more remaining in the UK. That UK market isn't shifting  out of the UK, it will be able to look for alternative suppliers though. The UK isn't an economy geared to exports, it's an economy geared to its internal market, it exports its surplus as much as anything else (that's slightly less true in terms of services, but that's a different issue).

&gt; sounds like the UK should have been trying to make trade deals once Brexit started, instead of doing whatever the fuck they did.

Well they *did* try, it just didn't happen to work as they had hoped.

I remember some news articles about the US trying to get more concessions from the UK in a trade deal such as lowering their food regulations (possibly allowing US exports such as chlorine chicken or some gmo products currently not exportable to the EU). 

We might not get much information on lots of such negotiations but I'm certain they have been and still are happening.


Everybody is aware that Brexit put the UK in a worse position in whatever negotiations they were to try, including the UK government itself, eventhough they're obviously avoiding ever mentioning that publicly. That's a peculiar position for the UK gov to be in because *they know* they'll most likely get the short end of the stick in any negotiations and it's actually more about how much worse the outcome will be. 

Contrast that with the expectation of a considerable part of their population, possible even somewhere about half-ish their electorate, expecting to be presented actual improvements, '*better deals*' in comparison to their previous situation as a privileged EU member state. Not delivering on these expectations or even insinuating not being able to do so would risk their party's political standing due to leaving lots of people disgruntled, so they try to avoid this or at least avoid publicising it to much because they *are* aware of all of this.


I reckon any negotiations (both on and off record) are burdened due to the UK gov nevertheless expecting better, or at the very least not obviously worse outcomes. 

In addition to this the first new trade deal they'd actually finish would basically broadcast the minimum extend of concessions the UK is willing to take. Doing so would seem less appealing the further away Brexit was/is, hence putting that off as long as possible. 

Likewise it's reasonable to assume that the UK spend quite some time in the past years trying to achieve better terms for any negotiations with the EU. To put it politely, not all of their expectations and demands were reasonable, which the EU made clear. To be fair it's a common, albeit moronic (imo) practice in political negotiations to go in pretending to aim way higher and then negotiating each other down to ultimately meet somewhere in the middle. 



&gt;So that way they would have a backup plan and have more leverage.

I think you're misunderstanding their predicament. Negotiations for such a 'backup plan' would as well happen within the same premise of a bad bargaining position because any negotiation partner would try to get far more concessions anyway. That's what's happening with the US for example. The US doesn't *need* to export that food, eventhough it'd be nice of course. The UK would *need* such a backup solution. Shitty position to negotiate from anyway, eh? (Also depending on whom they're negotiating with the other party could reasonably push to be not just a shitty backup solution, but to actually get a proper, more extensive deal done (with lots of concessions by the UK of course).)





&gt;They need need food? The US produces so much food and is in a trade war with China.

The apprehended lack of food is literally the consequence of tumbling over their trade rules with the EU. The UK has been importing lots of food from other EU countries for years and years now. The whole structures of trade and transport are in place, the production capacity is in place, etc. It's simply retarded to scrap all of that due to their negotiation nonsense. Their electorate would likely ask why the fuck they decided on importing one fifth or whatever of their food from horribly far away, possibly even with decreased standards in food regulations, instead of settling shit with the EU and continuing to receive the stuff that's basically grown around the corner. 


It's rather obvious that the EU wouldn't block that system on principle, it's rather a case of the UK having to fold some more in their negotiations. That's the trivial 'emergency solution', tucking their tail between their legs and meeting the EUs demands (which approximate to 'do most stuff similar to how we did it up until now anyway. no special treatment for you though' in most regards). Eventhough their politicians pretend this to be a truly horribly, utterly inacceptible outcome it's actually not that bad an option.



&gt; Looks like the UK only tried to make a deal with the EU exclusively and because of that lost a ton of leverage.

Nah. As I tried to explain they very likely tried negotiating with various relevant players but suffered under their unfavourable negotiation position.

2038,"&gt;The revenues of the plant reduce gradually as the capacity factor drops from 80% to 45% as the VRE market share climbs from 25% to 60%.

This is exactly the part i talk about. 25% marketshare: 80% capacity used. 60% marketshare: 45% capacity used.

If over the lifetime of your NPP your total output drops, you must sell each unit of energy at an increased price to make up for it.

Hinkley Point C, which i use as an example as it is the most modern plant in Europe, will cost 9,5 pence per kWh running as a base-load facility. As an on-demand facility i would estimate double that.

It makes no real economic sense to reduce the power output of a nuclear plant, ever. Same with renewables like solar or wind, in makes no economic sense to reduce their output. But if you combine nuclear with wind and solar, somebody has to reduce the output. Increasing the price of the energy they produce per kWh to stay economically viable.

Both have the same problems. And this has a name: diminishing returns. Which again is why i am against going 100% carbon neutral as a goal, as it is economical suicide to do so. We have to find another tech that can supply during peak demand. And sadly the only ones that can be used as peakers as gas, coal and oil, as their price per kWh depends mostly on the fuel, not the infrastructure. For example you can build 20 times as much natural gas power production capacity compared to nuclear.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/b42xi1/germany_poland_hungary_and_czech_republic_to/ej6sk05/,Alcobob,1553342219

I’m not saying it’s wrong because that’s just how things go. Let me say for at least the third time that non of us are responsible for what our ancestors did; But if I remember my history correctly the Roman Empire alone focused/brought a lot of prosperity into modern day Europe? And from there on out there were numerous other empires and wars all fighting for resources that many of which were brought from other lands. Lands that are currently producing helpless migrants.

And for the fourth time, I don’t think anyone has historic debts no matter how guilty or not guilty you are. We can’t take ownership nor correct actions from the past. What we can do though is recognize that our pasts have long lasting impacts and it’s hypocritical to turn people away when they have nowhere else to go.

2330,"Bill Gates is the only one that gets it, everyone else are sheeple that cant handle critical thought. I'm speaking of our politicians of course. 

&amp;#x200B;

Imagine if the whole of Tokyo or Mexico City were ran off of our current renewables ONLY with current technologies. Those two cities make NY look like a village. Now consider the fact that more and more super cities are being formed every year. 

&amp;#x200B;

What so many people fail to see is that all of those renewables require rare resources and they arent without their own pollutants rather it be in the processing, maintenance or the actual land required to store them. Coal is a prime example of an energy source that needs to be phases out immediately, yet some European countries that're supposedly so green aren't doing their part. The other side are those that think we should only be using turbines in our oceans and if you cant do that then a fuckton of wind turbines and solar fields. There's a really big problem with that, if you have a landlocked city for example and it's the size of Mexico City, solar fields and wind turbines cannot substitute other more pollutant energy sources. 

&amp;#x200B;

Bill Gates is the ONLY person I've personally heard reject the notion that we should go 100% renewable now. His take is to get rid of coal, to have a significant portion be renewables but to allow other energy sources to exist while technological improvements push forward, then after that if things like nuclear power are still way too dangerous then pull the plug on it, by then renewables will be significantly more effecient with the same size field being able to produce energy for 6x as many homes.. not to mention Elon Musk and others using home tiles for solar panels.

&amp;#x200B;

But to think we should just all go renewables now, the fact people actually think its entirely possible and a good thing, it's just propaganda and shills are keeping it form becoming a reality.. you can't fix stupid. That's not just naive at that point, that is proper stupidity along with those that think keeping coal around or rather ""clean coal"" like in Germany and the US is a smart move. Coal does 100% need to fuck off.

&amp;#x200B;

My biggest beef by far is why the fuck are we not talking about dramatically reducing our beef intake? Energy isn't the only pollutant, it's what we eat as well and what we use to get to and from work or school. Again, a case where people can only handle bite sized solutions at a time rather than reigning in the whole fucking thing. If cities simply cannot deal with renewables on such a large scale, then what about traffic reduction or the godless cow farts?

2453,"Nearly 30 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, Michael Prütz thinks Germany’s capital city is ready for a new socialist revolution. 

An insurance broker by day, Mr Prütz is one of the leaders of a bold campaign to expropriate Berlin’s biggest residential landlord, Deutsche Wohnen, and take its 110,000 flats into public ownership.

“We tenants of Berlin are under attack from greedy property companies that seek maximum profit with minimum effort,” he said, accusing Deutsche Wohnen of acting “as if it is California during the Gold Rush”. 

Mr Prütz and his comrades plan a city referendum where voters will be asked to back a plan to “socialise” around 200,000 flats, most belonging to DW. 



Next month they start collecting signatures to support the initiative, which has been fuelled by widespread anger at soaring rents.

This is just common sense: if I invite someone to my house as a guest, I expect them to abide by my rules, not to try to impose THEIR rules on me. If the latter happens I will kick them out, and I have every right to do so.

Islam is an extremely aggressive expansionist religion that is incompatible with Western values. Muslims do not tolerate other religions well, in fact they want to impose their own religion and sharia law on others - by force if need be, and if they can.

To understand what might happen if you don't protect your culture and identity when faced with aggressive cultures like that, just read about Lebanon. At the time a country where the majority of the population was Christian and co-existed peacefully with a Muslim minority, their good deed of sheltering over a quarter of a million of Palestinian refugees fleeing from the Arab vs. Israel war did not go unpunished: this directly resulted in a Christian vs. Muslim civil war that totally destroyed the country and caused an estimate of 120,000 fatalities and countless massacres of men, women and children.

2465,"&gt;And according to their time they were tolerant. 

It was not tolerant. Not even by a long shot. The only people who still believe this are uneducated people or people who fell for the bought-and-paid-for narrative of the Turkish state which has numerous """"""historians"""""" on its payroll (looking at you Bernard Lewis - you genocide denying filth).

When you have two genocides on roll; a history of discriminating, clearly, against a particular religion; several literal crimes against civilians (Batak Massacre); known forceful expulsion of native peoples (Eastern Bulgaria and others); economic, cultural and legal discrimination against a particular religion... yeah... tolerant indeed. It was not tolerant when Europeans did it and it wasn't tolerant when Asian Ottomans did it, sorry.

&gt;You compare it to their time

Again, several similar practices have been done by Europeans. In no way shape or form is it referred to as ""tolerant"". In fact, the push back within historiography and society against these practices has been quite severe. 

Again, no, it wasn't tolerant to anyone but maybe Muslims.

&gt;Blood tax was removed later 

Countries like Greece and Bulgaria had to endure centuries of this disgusting, discriminatory practice which was, for the most part, directed exclusively against Christians. Very tolerant Ottoman Islam, indeed.

&gt;and even when it was there those people received the best education the state can provide. Yes its cruel but technically they had a better life than their parents which were likely poor farmers/fisherman etc. 

Since you might be uneducated about the discriminatory nature of the Ottoman Empire, I'll help you out. I know ultra-nationalist takes on Turkish history is commonplace in Turkish schools nowadays but hey, whatever, no biggie.

1) Christian ONLY children, from 8 - 17, where KIDNAPPED from their parents. They were not recruited nor selected. They were literally stolen from their mothers, fathers. Tolerant Ottomans, indeed.

2) Instances of parents DISFIGURING their children so they wouldn't be KIDNAPPED existed. But wait I thought this was just a sign up for boarding school, right? Tolerant Ottomans, indeed.

3) The CHILDREN were KIDNAPPED from communities which needed them. A time when having extra people in the fields mattered a lot. This is a rebutal of your argument that this practice of kidnapping *literal* children, somehow, helped communities. Tolerant Ottomans, indeed.

4) They would be FORCEFULLY converted to Islam. They were not allowed to follow the religion and culture of their native lands. If the purpose was to give them a better life then why such an aggressive conversion? Tolerant Ottomans, indeed.

5) They were FORCED to move away from their homelands until they mostly forgot where they came from. Again, see how this totally wasn't an Ottoman scheme to leech off of other peoples? Tolerant Ottomans, indeed.

6) They were FORCED into MILITARY SLAVERY. This really isn't up for debate. Those that were further divided as future soldiers from the ones kidnapped where, more or less, slaves. Tolerant Ottomans, indeed.

7) They could not marry. Tolerant Ottomans, indeed.

8) Their parents were already double taxed because they were Christian by the """"""tolerant"""""" Ottoman Empire. Which is why you had instances where some gave their children away since the poverty of the Middle Ages and the discriminatory, CHRISTIAN ONLY tax was too much to bear. 

So no. They ABSOLUTELY did not live a ""better life"". One of many reasons their families had it ""worse"" than them, in the first place, is because they had a foreign invader who treated them as second-class citizens and made their life worse through Christian-only taxation and other forms of discrimination.  

It's as if I stole most of your money - because you belonged to ""X"" group - discriminated against you throughout society and then offered you what was, basically, military slavery. Tolerant Ottomans, indeed.

9) They were FORCED to learn Turkish and things relating to Islam. What you're saying - that they received better education - is misleading to say the least. 

Most of those kidnapped did NOT end up in high offices of the Ottoman Empire. In fact, very few did. Only the ones further selected to become administrators received an education into a foreign and alien culture that they were abducted into. Again, very few.

Absolutely ridiculous to claim that being kidnaped; forcefully converted; culturally denied your true roots; with a high chance of being forced into military slavery; forced to serve a foreign invading power instead of helping and living with your family - ridiculous to claim this was ""better"". 

We're now claiming that abduction, near and actual slavery, forceful cultural conversion is ""the good life""? So what Europeans did to Africans was ok and ""tolerant"", as you say, since a lot had it worse (aka, outright being wiped out as peoples - native American Indians for example)? I wonder what reactions I'll get if I post this somewhere... 🤔
   
&gt;This was at a time where christians directly massacred eachother for believing the other denomination. 

Most of the Christians were Orthodox - I personally don't know of any instances of Ortho-on-Ortho ""massacres"" that occurred in Greece, Bulgaria, Serbia etc. Hungary was Catholic and Walachia/Moldavia/Romania wad Orthodox - still no massacres.

There was the Turkish Islamic massacre on Orthodox Bulgarians, however - the Batak Massacre. Also the one against Greeks. Also the one against Armenians (the last two, funnily, in a time when the Turkish state had ""evolved"").

&gt;France literally saw non-france speakers as sub-human and completely erased their culture/language. 

The Ottoman/Turkish state ""cleansed"" it's language of Latin, Greek, Arabic influences. 

Barely in 2013, a law which forced minorities to adopt ""Turkish"" names, was repealed. ""Surname Law"", check it out.

&gt;Christians lived as second-class citizens but they LIVED and could actually live a decent life. 

See all the above. No, they absolutely didn't.

Yes tolerant. You dont compare ottoman empire to modern day 21st century mentality. You compare it to their time. And according to their time they *were* tolerant. Blood tax was removed later and even when it was there those people received the best education the state can provide. Yes its cruel but technically they had a better life than their parents which were likely poor farmers/fisherman etc. This was at a time where christians directly massacred eachother for believing the other denomination. France literally saw non-france speakers as sub-human and completely erased their culture/language. 

Christians lived as second-class citizens but they LIVED and could actually live a decent life. They didnt relocate btw they either became soldiers or became statesman in high positions.

I'm from Germany and this resonates with me as well. All my life all I hear is that we have to spend less money and have to close public swimming pools. We just don't have the money, they say. People drown because we no longer provide swimming lessons to all pupils, and we can't because we are closing more and more swimming pools.

2591,"&gt;Perhaps you could actually listen to what he said

I did listen to quite a lot of things he said in the past months, and I stand by my statement: he's mostly full of shit. At some point you simply stop listening to that kind of guy, because it's all about feeding the narrative rather than dealing with the real world and its complexities. And it gets old fast. And quite frankly intellectually revolting.

Granted, it's only my opinion and you're free to disagree.


&gt;On the other hand, you're misrepresenting the results of the study you quoted yourself. The poll asked them several questions about their feelings on the EU (none of them was about whether we should leave)

I'm not ""misrepresenting"" it, I'm literally quoting a very simple, clear question and the replies it obtained. 

And you're wrong. This is the poll: https://staticswww.bva-group.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Les-Fran%C3%A7ais-lUE-et-l%C3%A9lection-europ%C3%A9enne-2019-Pr%C3%A9sentation-des-r%C3%A9sultats-14-d%C3%A9cembre-2018-Diffusion.pdf

Page 30. ""*Should France leave the EU?*"" Literally. 14% in favour.

So here we are, the bottom line is, we have two polls pretty much contradicting each other, one is crediting **40%** in favour of France leaving the EU, while the other one is only crediting **14%**. That's an **insanely** wide gap, for polls produced within 2 months of each other. Which raises some serious questions.

Now I'm not paying that much attention to polls, while potentially helpful, I think they're garbage overall and have become nefarious in practice. But if you expect me to favour one of those two polls, I'll give the BVA one much more credit. For several reasons. 

- Because IFOP have been notoriously criticized for years regarding its somewhat lacking, dubious polling methodology, more than once producing sub-par works, and in some cases, quite openly biased (probably out of rushed/poorly performed jobs than ill-intent).

- Because the poll was commissioned by *Valeurs Actuelles*, which is a magazine openly and notoriously known for its tendencies oscillating between conservative-right-wing and reactionary-far-right, which coupled to the latter point, somehow doesn't entice me to fully trust the results garnered by this poll, or its overall seriousness altogether.

- Because the poll had a much smaller respondent base (1210 IFOP vs 5456 BVA).

- Because on average nearly *half* of the IFOP respondents replied they wouldn't vote in such a referendum (the poll is specifically about RICs, by the way, not the EU, and is structured in a very peculiar way).

- **Maybe most importantly**, because it's highly, ridiculously incoherent with the results of countless various polls, studies, reports produced over the years regarding the evolution of support and criticism toward the European Union. And it simply feels ridiculously wrong altogether. As I previously emphasized, people are not univocally *for* or *against* the EU, support and rejection ranges through a gradient of opinions, which make the results of this poll absolutely unrealistic, if not highly suspicious. Or maybe quite simply, the product of a quick-and-dirty job.

Now, regardless of that particular poll, to actually believe, especially in the wake of the whole mess that is the Brexit, that 40% of the French electorate would want France to leave the EU is absolutely, utterly, ridiculously moronic.

If anything, it says something about, either your gullibility and sheer lack of critical thinking, or your own, very opinionated and self-entertained belief that France should leave the EU. I don't mean any offense, I simply cannot help but notice it and wonder.

For reference, this is the full IFOP poll: https://www.ifop.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/116120-R%C3%A9sultats-Les-Fran%C3%A7ais-et-le-RIC.pdf",Europe,/r/europe/comments/b44aox/petition_to_revoke_article_50_breaks_3_million/ej64sez/,Orravan_O,1553310138

2601,"&gt; Apparently nobody considers the fact that at some point that deficit will have to be quenched with again higher taxes or budget cuts both of which will have to go beyond the original tax cuts because of the additionally incurred debt.

I certainly agree that Trump isn't exactly the beacon of righteousness when it comes to representing right right-wing principles in the best possible light. 

However the corporate tax in the US was even higher than it it here in Denmark before Trump's tax breaks, and it would for sure have been giving US corporations a hard time of competing on the international market if they had continued to be that high.

Trump has also kept up with or even spent more than Obama did for the same amount of time, which is why I wouldn't really consider him much of a liberal (libertarian, if you're American).

In a (my) perfect world that deficit shouldn't be quenched with even higher taxes, but Trump should have rather started immediately upon getting into office looking at vastly reducing government spending, to bring down the national debt that had been built up from the many previous administrations. Government spending is what drives government debt and tax increases while also stagnating growth in a country. Now maybe growth is not always a priority which can also be fine sometimes, but as long as people are aware of that they certainly have the right to choose whatever option they see fit.

Infrastructure is important but reprioritizing how to spend tax money could work equally as well as just increasing taxes or performing quantative easing whenever the government feels like spending more. As far as I know there are countless and countless amounts of bureacracy offices in Washington D.C. as well as many other US cities, handling oversight of paperwork and regulations of private corporations. It's like busy-work used to keep private businesses from operating effectively.

In the case at hand, the status quo is Remain and the proposed change is May's deal. Those should be the actual options. No-deal is not a real proposal, it is more of a failure at negotiating.

 https://twitter.com/DTzantchev/status/1108807850397261826?s=09

&gt;Aid the overrunning flurry of talks between the EU leaders last night, Dimiter Tzantchev, Bulgaria’s permanent representative in Brussels, found a moment to tweet a photo from deep inside the Europa building. In French he titled it: “In the corridors of the #EuropeanCouncil”. The shot was remarkable for its composition and content. Half in light and half in shadow, like the figures of an early modern Dutch painting, a crescent of officials and diplomats huddled around a laptop to devise a new timetable for Britain’s exit from the club.

&gt;There was Sabine Weyand, the brains behind the European Commission’s negotiating efforts, hands clasped. To her right: Declan Kelleher, Ireland’s permanent representative, peering through his glasses and thumbs tapping away on a phone. To her left: Philippe Etienne, a veteran French diplomat, and Uwe Corsepius, Angela Merkel’s dry-as-dust European affairs supremo, lips sceptically pursed. Among those crouching around the laptop were Robert de Groot, the Dutch permanent representative to the EU, and Clement Beaune, Emmanuel Macron’s “Monsieur Europe”.

&gt;European leaders have embraced the photo. Michel Barnier, the Commission’s chief Brexit negotiator, retweeted it this morning with the cheery English caption: “Building European unity: collective and permanent work!” [...]

To be fair, I'm a twenty year old American living and studying in France. I live, work and study every day with people from dozens of other countries. My point of view will necesarily be rather more internationalist than most as a result.

And I don't argue that supranational organizations are more important than states; but certainly year by year their influence grows. But I think that there's a division between international political realities and personal identities. In my opinion many people are culturally less rooted in individual states; I can feel rather at home in about any western country I travel to. We're increasingly multilingual, we appreciate the same music and films, we're accustomed to the same foods and fashions. We adhere generally to the same broad set of political values (at the very lesat, a common rather liberal conception of rights and obligations).

&gt; Does it really bother a Swedish reader? 

It certainly can. It impedes significantly with legibility.

It's not omitting diacritics, it's changing letters. Writing E instead of É would be an example of omitting a diacritic in Swedish. By doing that you can turn an idea into hibernation, but it usually isn't the end of the world since context usually is enough. Doing that can certainly be seen in casual texting here too. 

But replacing distinct letters like ÅÄÖ with other letters is a whole different thing. Our writing system is built on having nine vowels, so you can't just remove three. And it's not only that it changes the letter itself to a different one, it also changes how surrounding letters are read. Reading it becomes very unnatural. 

No Swede would ever eve think of replacing Å/Ä/Ö with a different letter no matter how casual the texting is. Never. The only time that happens is if you can't use ÅÄÖ, most commonly seen in things like URLs and email addresses.

At the current global average price point, nuclear power remains at the mercy of politicians because its economic case is not strong enough to facilitate pure market-driven deployment.

Apart from that I am a bit skeptic about what you are arguing.

First off, having massive lithium batteries everywhere to compensate the volatility of solar and wind seems to me a bit contrary to the idea of green energy. I am far from an expert but I don't think large scale battery usage like the australian tesla thing are very environmentally friendly.

Another thing I am worried about is that if we want to replace all fossil fuels over a market driven incentive structure like you are laying out is if that would actually provide a constant and reliable supply of power. Don't get me wrong I am not making the ""but what if no wind and dark"" argument.
I am worried that the price fluctuation between times where there is an overabundant supply and a scarce supply would mess with how our water supply and hospitals and so on behave.

2873,"&gt; Also in the context of talking about a very large group of people (or indeed any otherwise countable integer, like rice as you mention) less would indeed be more appropriate since it's not a strictly countable amount.

No such rule exists. The rule isn't that you should use less if the number is over 100 or 1000 or whatever and fewer otherwise. It's

&gt; Use fewer if you’re referring to people or things in the plural (e.g. houses, newspapers, dogs, students, children).

&gt; Use less when you’re referring to something that can’t be counted or doesn’t have a plural (e.g. money, air, time, music, rain).

— https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/usage/less-or-fewer

People can very well be counted. It's the entire basis of democracy.

Less vs fewer isn't about the actual number, it's about the nature of the substance.

Nobody counts the trees in a forest, but we do say ""fewer trees"" because a tree is a meaningful object/thing.

If you put your mind to it, you can count the number of rice seeds in a small cup, but we still say ""less rice"" because one seed isn't meaningful. Rice is measured by volume or weight like water or milk.

Quite unrelated, but he's an example of another way we treat continuous and discreet things differently. 

&gt; You're a janitor. You have to clean floors 4 to 8 from 2 PM until 4 PM. How many floors do you have to clean per hour?

If you rushed, you might have said 2 floors per hour, but there are 4-2=2 hours to do the work and 5 floors to clean: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 (i.e. 8-4+1=5)

That is, we treat floors discreetly, we say ""fewer floors"", we have a plural for it, and we count them inclusively.

We treat time continuously, we say ""less time"", we don't have a plural, and we count it exclusively (i.e. 2 PM to 4 PM means 2:00 to 4:00 (2 hours), not 2:00 to 4:59:59 (3 hours)).",Romania,/r/europe/comments/b43c2d/ukraines_second_largest_solar_power_plant_has/ej57mu5/,f567,1553285256

Many French military commands have a very legalistic, procedural approach to their missions, and typically talk in a very crude, no-bullshit fashion.

The government certainly doesn't want him to say that, but he doesn't give a shit about these political maneuvers, and he just states how the army operates in a well defined legal framework and what this framework is. 

The government is playing a weird game. At the same time they don't want the army to get involved, but they need the numbers (there really are so many places to protect that the police is spread very thin and can't answer properly go overboard in specific areas like last weekend), and they chose to use the image of the army to look tough",France,/r/europe/comments/b47pq9/soldiers_may_open_fire_if_lives_at_risk_in_yellow/ej57z8w/,n9795,1553285460

I don’t think I’m anywhere near authorized to give the American take on this lol, but I’m happy to give my personal take

I can tell you that in 2016, there was a certain anti-establishment streak that viewed Trump’s victory and Brexit passing as both symptoms of disillusioned commoners giving the finger to their ruling class.  Both Trump &amp; Bernie’s successes in their primaries were seen as the start of the same thing, the voting populace bucking the desires &amp; expectations of the established powers that be.

I remember in the lead up to the referendum, in American circles there was a certain impression of the “remain” campaign doing some shameless fear-mongering.  I remember people in local Facebook groups sharing pictures of pro-remain posters and flyers, talking about how they threatened apocalypse, or portrayed voting “leave” as the pro-racism team.

My most clear impression was that, technical details aside, the establishment class obviously had an agenda, and there was some satisfaction in seeing voters not let them get their way.  Speaking for myself, it was nice seeing the big clashes framed as “the powerful elite vs the common masses “ for a while, but it didn’t last.  It didn’t take long at all for the framing to slide back to “the progressive/left/Good vs the backwards/bigoted/Right.”  At this point in America, Brexit vs remain is viewed as just another extension of our all-encompassing left vs right war, just like *everything* else.

For my personal perspective on the current fight, to me it looks like everyone in a position of political power strongly wants the UK to stay in the EU, but can’t say so without losing their positions.  Kinda seems to me like the plan is to drag it on as long as possible, make every avenue to disentangle as hard &amp; unsavory as possible, to make it look like they’re trying but it’s just too hard, hope to stretch it out long enough and make it suck so much that eventually the public will accept dropping the whole issue.

I don’t personally have an opinion on pro-vs-against the European Union (&amp; Britain’s relationship to it), but I am concerned with the will of the people getting control of their institutions back; so if The Powers That Be(tm) are wanting to keep the EU intact against the will of the actually people living in England, then I hope they don’t get their way (even if it’s through swaying public opinion to what they prefer).",,/r/europe/comments/b43gpk/may_got_her_extension_times_cartoon/ej4w5jv/,Wordshark,1553277970
2980,"&gt;  (I'll feign to ignore your sarcastic comments that contribute nothing to the discussion).

Turnabout is fair play.  If you don't like it, don't start it.

&gt; However, from what I've gathered, these cases do not seem to be: ""give us a better price or your competitor will do it"".
&gt; 
&gt; It's more like: ""if you don't licence it yourself nor sell the licence to someone else, then that absolutely necessary drug won't be available, thus we will allow another company to licence it but don't worry, you'll still get royalties"". That's a bit different.

That is not materially different.  It is a diminution of patent rights. 
 Whatever price the government chooses to pay (""royalties""), it can do so.  The company can either accept it, or get nothing.  And it shifts the burden of drug R&amp;D costs onto American consumers.",Poland,/r/europe/comments/b3gaqv/trump_threatens_to_use_us_trade_talks_to_force/ej4w6za/,Thurallor,1553277997

2992,"&gt;6. According to some critics, the Standards promote “masturbation” and “playing doctors” in children from age 1 to 4 and encourage 6 year old children to “explore same-sex relationships”. Is this true?  
&gt;  
&gt;As mentioned, it is considered crucial that sexuality education is age-appropriate. Therefore, the Standards include information about the typical developmental stages of children. This information is addressed to professionals (e.g. teachers, including kindergarten teachers), who need to be informed about the variety of normal phenomena in the psychosexual development of children including, in fact, early childhood masturbation and “doctor” games. Without such knowledge, there is a risk that professionals will react in inappropriate ways, possibly harming the child and/or hindering his/her future healthy development. The Standards therefore inform professionals about how to deal with these phenomena in a high-quality sexuality education programme in a developmentally appropriate way.

3010,"&gt;I'm talking about Norwegian.

People who made the map do not speak Norwegian and do not know how to type Norwegian. They saw a character called U+00E5 LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH RING ABOVE, skipped the ring part and wrote ""a"". This is how everyone deals with foreign diacritics, regardless whether those diacritics are considered an essential part of the letter itself by the native speakers – especially since people don't know which diacritics are essential in which language.

&gt;Å is not created by adding a diacritic to A

It literally is. In fact, there is an alternative representation of å in Unicode, a sequence of U+0061 LATIN SMALL LETTER A and U+030A COMBINING RING ABOVE. And what is the block that U+030A is in called? Combining **Diacritical** Marks Block. Every Scandinavian Apple user commits the heresy of typing ""å"" as ""a"" with a separate diacritic.

Scandinavians may be all ""it's a totally different letter, you guys, respect that!"" but then they [do not show similar respect to other languages](https://i.imgur.com/xgcrCjl.png) and throw their diacritics away, even though those diacritics are as essential parts of those letters as the ring is to å.

So no, Å is not unique. It's just an A with a circle. So don't get your panties in a twist when someone outside Scandinavia omits the circle.",Poland,/r/europe/comments/b422v2/transboundary_river_basins_of_europe/ej4iyu4/,vytah,1553269896

Where do you even get this crap from?  

Unprocessed waste is, stored at the facilities that produce it or moved to the Borssele plant. The processed waste is also being stored above ground. 

&gt; The current policy specifies that all radioactive waste shall be stored **above ground** in engineered structures that allow retrieval at all times for a period of at least 100 years

https://newmdb.iaea.org/profiles.aspx?ByCountry=NL

Here from the policy: https://www.osti.gov/etdeweb/servlets/purl/20273568

&gt; In  abeyance  of  a  final  decision  an  engineered  surface  facility  was  commissionedfor  storage  of  radioactive  waste  with  a  capacity  to  accommodate  all  waste  generated  in  aperiod   of  50-100  years.  This   storage  facility   operated   by  the   Central  Organisation   forRadioactive  Waste (COVRA)  is currently  in operation  for  low - and medium  level  radioactivewaste while a building  for high level waste  is under  construction.



There has been a [study](https://www.deingenieur.nl/artikel/underground-disposal-safe-for-dutch-nuclear-waste) made 2018 (by COVRA) which concluded with: 

&gt; The study has not established a location, as the researchers have expressly avoided this issue. They are assuming that the location will be determined in 2100

Also from the IAEA page:

&gt;  The high groundwater table in the Netherlands disfavours the use of shallow land burial for short-lived radioactive waste, so ultimately all categories of radioactive waste must be placed in a deep geologic repository.

Sure you can. Just because it's morally objectionable, doesn't mean it's not a democracy. Democracy isn't equivalent to liberal democracy, or western democracy, or any other adjective you care to use. It's people power by the terms of voting. 

You're adding all these extra conditions to democracy that don't exist in the dictionary. It doesn't matter if you're illiberal, have a command economy, slavery, or no free press - those aren't necessary to having free voting. 

&gt; But that's somehow not allowed, so then a supermajority certainly is required.

In Brexit? It's generally frowned upon to call a revote when there's an obvious majority, and when the directive hasn't been carried out yet. A supermajority wouldn't solve that anyway, because people would complain if it was a close vote then too, with the added fun of the winning side losing because of the rules of the competition. We'd be having the exact same argument if a supermajority of 65% was required, and it was 64:36 Leave:Remain, or 66:34 Leave:Remain. Either Leave would be pissed because they had a majority that wouldn't be good enough, or Remain would be pissed because they picked the wrong arbitrary number to demand. 

&gt; And if you check more often

So don't check as often then. 



&gt;&gt;It's hardly a democracy if the people don't get to vote freely, or was your example just supposed to be 'the government is despicable?' Because that doesn't stop it being a democracy either. It doesn't matter what the people are voting for, if the entire electorate get to vote, then it's democracy.

&gt;No. A country where the state bullies the people is not a democracy.

3063,"I disagree. It's very easy right now to insult the UK and say they ""cannot decide on anything"" and ""nothing has their support"", but that is quite simply **not true**. Parliament has voted and already rejected 'No Deal', but they require changes to the backstop in the current deal before they will support it. Of course there are fringes who support minority positions, but there is clearly no parliamentary majority for 'Remain' or 'No Deal'.

So if the problems are with the backstop, let's look at the backstop; why does it even exist? Primarily, to avoid a hard border with the Republic of Ireland *in the event that a free-trade agreement cannot be reached in the future*. Both sides still intend to pursue an FTA, but this mechanism exists so that the worst-case scenario is not so bad and respects the Good Friday Agreement.

If the backstop ever took effect, it would bind the UK to the EU's rules without the rights of a member-state or any definitive way out. That is clearly unacceptable for the UK, as it would be for any country. At the same time, without an FTA, there needs to be some kind of planning for the worst-case situation. Basically, **the whole idea** of a backstop is not really acceptable to the UK parliament. It massively ties their hands when negotiating the future relationship (they basically cannot refuse), while at the same time the EU refuses to make any similar commitments about that relationship. It is the EU who wants things both ways.

The only solution is that the withdrawal agreement must include the future relationship. That would make the backstop entirely unnecessary.",,/r/europe/comments/b3nnce/european_council_summit_thursday_and_friday_2122/ej4jrwy/,kawag,1553270360

German bond prices are rising because German bonds are *safe* and a lot of large, institutional investors are clearly seeking a safe investment with a degree of desperation.

From this we can assume that one or all of the following are true to some degree:

1.  Institutional investors have a bleak outlook on the future.
2.  There's so much cash floating out there (very likely due to lingering effects from QE), especially at the investment level, and it can't find safe investments, that 0-yield bonds from a safe country are preferable to private investments.  This, BTW, would be more evidence that we've taken supply-side economics too far.

It's peak. It's pretty common for articles to confuse MW with MWh or power with energy. Here is the example from the article:

&gt; generates 64 megawatts of electricity annually

This makes no sense. Annual electricity generation is measured in kWh or MWh and not in kW or MW. Fixed system of 64 MWdc with a specific production of around 1,300 kWh/kW (which I assume is likely in this particular location) would produce around 83,200 MWh annually in the first year and about 0.5% decline in every subsequent year. Average Ukrainian seems to be [consuming around 3,234 kWh annually](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_electricity_consumption), so that would mean the solar farm serves the need of around 26,000 people.",,/r/europe/comments/b43c2d/ukraines_second_largest_solar_power_plant_has/ej4k6x6/,jdoe1029384756,1553270605
3089,"&gt;Brăila was full of greeks

Do you have issues understanding the concept of ""core Romanian territory throughout history""? Braila was on the fringe of Romanian control many times and indeed had it's considerable non-Romanian (or Vlah) minorities. Why is this so hard for you to understand? The great majority of Romanian/Wallachian/Moldovan territory was mostly never inhabited by anyone else but Romanians (or their pre-national awakening equivalents). Yes. Turks/Ottomans or Greeks had nothing to do with the ""genesis"" of the Romanian ethnic.

&gt;Also, remember the Bizantine Empire?

Yes, it was present in a part of Romania that was ALWAYS minority-Romanian. That would be Dobrogea. Dobrogea could not be in any way considered ""core Romanian"" territory. What do Byzanties have to do with the Romanian ethnogenesis which you implied was influenced by ""Turks and Greeks living with us for centuries - a claim that is nothing else but internet-historic-pseudo-science.

&gt;Also, remember Fanar, the Istambul neigbourhood that gave us more than one century of greek administration?

First of all, yes, Greeks. Second you're talking about administration. Again, what does this have to do with the ethnogenesis of Romanians? A bunch of hospodars and their retinue negates the millions of ethnic-Vlahs/Romanians that made the Romanian ethnic?

&gt;Also, Mihai Viteazu was half greek

From this you take away that the whole Romanian ethnic group is ""half greek""? So, from this we can take away that Dutch people are half-Spanish, Germans half-Slavic, Turks half-Kurdish/Arabic and so on. 

We can go further with this to the modern day, if you want. British people half-Asian? Germans half-Turkish? I'll stop here since I think I've made it well and obvious how ridiculous your omission of the varying magnitudes of ""settlement"" and ""relations"" between varying peoples that were present in the general area of what is now Romania. 

&gt;And turks.. I won't look now for how many centuries.

I have no idea what this is supposed to mean. Maybe you can clear it up? 

In any event, let me reiterate. The Romanian ethnogenesis has nothing to do with Turks or Greeks. Neither of these two peoples were ""settled"" in what can be considered as core Romanian territory. 

This is even more evident in a country even more closer to modern day Turkey - Bulgaria. A short recap, throughout history, Eastern Bulgaria was forcefully colonized by Ottoman Turks via replacement and expulsion of native Slavic Bulgarians.

In the present day one can clearly tell apart Turkish-Bulgarians from Slavic Bulgarians both culturally and genetically. 

Why would then a country like Romania, that had no instances of this on its main territory, somehow have ""Turks and Romanians living together for centuries""? ",Romania,/r/europe/comments/b3urb9/translation_our_children_will_be_free_romanian/ej4k6yz/,scotty_rotten,1553270606

3184,"The removal of borders and the nation is a return to tribalism without borders. You know, the time when we were constantly murdering eachother over land, based on ethnic/tribal divide (no rule to respect the land of others, no concept of sovereignty). This is not just Europe by the way, but a human universal. We created borders to limit those land conflicts, we created the nation state to replace our tribal ethnic identity with a national cultural identity everybody can be part of... The removal of borders is the return to tribes.  


The only way in which we interfere in Africa is that we want them to be western democracies in return for our monetary aid. We want them to turn into rich, western states we can trade with and be allied with. This is also what we did with China, but unfortunately they didn't become as liberal as we expected them to become. If that is what neo-colonialism is then I'm unsure whether that is bad at all. If they don't want our help, all they have to do is renounce our money and our western ideals. This is not colonialism in the sense of occupation and forced transformation. This is ""colonialism"" in the sense of extending a helping hand in exchange for becoming a liberal state. Our values are not evil, they are great. They made us great and they can make them great. If they don't want those values, by all means they should renounce our aid and influence, THEY CAN, like China has despite our efforts to make them a western liberal state.  


About the standards... what do you want? To instantly transform poor states into highly developed western states? Perhaps if we return actual colonialism that might be possible....... But they will have to do this themselves. How do you propose to magically make all of the planet equally developed? It's unrealistic and ill-informed. We can't. The best we can do is help them develop their economy, give them money, give them inspiration to create societies like ours, so they can become like us. We don't have a magic wand and people are NOT justified in being angry about lower standards if they simply live in a lower standard country. They can transform it like China transformed. For Nigeria even smartly reinvesting oil money is an option to develop fast, like the gulf states did. It is NOT our fault that they failed to do so and NOT our fault that we are more succesful.  


 If they have a better system that works for them instead of our western values, go for it. I also think that would fit better in Africa, but... someone has to create a viable system first, someone in Africa has to. You can't not have any system yourself and at the same time blame Europe for wanting to help you be like them. That is the only option right now and if you want an alternative it is up to you to create that alternative. I think it'd be very good for Africa if they were to create a system specifically for themselves that works best for their situation. I see too that western values are improperly adopted there most of the time, leading to corrupt and/or failed states. But what other option is there than a western democracy right now? There is no African system, I hope someone will create something to replace the current trend of corruption and poor governance.  


Neo-colonialism is not a forced exercise. Yes we spend the money now because we want them to be western allies in the future, yes we do it because we want trade partners in the future, absolutely. It's not selfless, but we do genuinely see it as helping them form a decent state. And yes, I'm even aware that neo-colonialism is strikingly similar to colonialism in the late 19th, early 20th century. Back then, too, we went there with the intent to end slavery, to help them build infrastructure, etc.... and to make money off it, and for power. But there is one vital difference between the scramble for Africa then and neo-colonialism today: if you don't want our money and don't want our influence, don't take it and go your own way. But if you turn into a dictatorship you risk us overthrowing the government, that's true and I don't think I should be proud of that interventionist approach. I'm aware of the coersive elements of neo-colonialism, but I just don't know what the alternative is... The EU spends 90 billion euros yearly on foreign aid, the US 30 billion dollars. What happens when we cease to spend that money? What happens when we cease to aid African countries to be like us and instead leave them be for themselves? I doubt that Africa will benefit from that. Dictatorships might form, China would in any case fill our vacuum and instill a very different ideology in Africa... I just don't see the alternative even though I want one to exist.

Yep, that's why all of Europe has such strict borders. It's why the states of the US are always fighting each other and it's why Hadrian's wall should be rebuilt.

Nigeria may be the richest country in Africa, but we interfere with _all_ of Africa, so this is meaningless. As for the job creation and 'progress'. Stalin transformed a bunch of farmers into a nuclear superpower. Was that a good thing too?

3217,"National interests / proximate political interests.

Firstly, in Czechia climate change is a non-issue. I'd say most of the population don't care and there is a vocal minority of climate deniers. People warning about it are mostly associated with the Greens who are completely sidelined in the political debate or ridiculed as alarmists. This means that there is little to no public pressure that would force politicians to be more climate-aware in their policy-making.

Secondly, the Czech Republic is a very industry-reliant country and the structure of its economy necessarily means it is more energy intensive. If we're asked to completely decarbonise the economy, it will hit us more that it will hit other countries, so there's a pressure from the industry and trade unions against too ambitious carbon goals.

Third, bad experience with renewable energy sources. After the bungled solar subsidy scheme of the previous governments which led to billions and billions handed over to ""solar barons"" building PVE plants nobody wanted or needed, solar energy has a bad name. Wind energy is not very viable in this country either and people are RABIDLY opposed to ruining mountain landscapes (the only places sufficiently windy) with more wind turbines (Czechs are fairly ecologically minded, but in different ways than the Westerners. Landscape conservation enjoys broad support, more abstract environmentalism doesn't.)

Fourth, we've reached an impasse about building new nuclear power plants and there's opposition to it from some of our major allies in Europe (Germany, Austria), so we can't even go this way. 


So, how are we supposed to meet these goals, binding bicycle quotas or something? I suppose the other sceptical country have very real reasons for being against these ambitious goals as well.

That seems like the only reasonably certain way to force a choice between crashing out, May's Deal, revoking A50, and applying for a long extension (would include holding EU elections). Of course, since there are more than 2 options there, it would have to be a multi-part vote, unless e.g. the ""No to crashing out"" vote that has already been held is still considered valid. However, in that case presumably ""No to May's Deal"" would still be in force too, leaving the options as ""Does parliament want to A) apply for a long extension, including holding EU elections now, or B) revoke A50"". Which is anybody's guess what they would actually decide, I think. Hence I would assume that they would claim that first, the ""No to crashing out"" would be in relation to March 29, so April 14/May 22 is a separate thing, and second, that the current deal is slightly different because the extra assurances from the EU are now legally binding, and hence all 4 options remain on the table.",Finland,/r/europe/comments/b3x565/brexit_eu_leaders_agree_brexit_delay_plan/ej3zlea/,ohitsasnaake,1553255565

I myself moved and lived for one year and a bit in the UK.

Also I never encountered xenophobia. Probably if I were to go to some ""ghetto"" communities, I might have encountered it, but the every-day English people were really nice to me. It was tough though not to be able to speak my native language and I had to seek out other fellow Romanians to fill in that need.

3327,"&gt;Nope. The universe doesn't make computers, the internet, cars, satellites, undersea cables, routers, cultivated food, distributed water, cities, roads, airplanes etc. We the people do provide these things.
&gt;When we say 'the market provides', we mean the people provide. The market is not an entity by itself, it's a synonym for the people working under specific terms and conditions.

Then by the same reasoning: The market doesn't make computers, the internet, cars, satellites, undersea cables, routers, cultivated food, distributed water, cities, roads, airplanes etc. We the people do provide these things.


&gt;Who told you that big companies like free markets? they don't. The bigger companies are, the more the companies want to drive out competition. 

And that's why they like copyright.

&gt;Of course. The market shouldn't have monopolies or oligopolies. That's actually part of the theory behind markets.
&gt;You are mixing two different things into the conversation: a) IP protection, b) monopolies/oligopolies.
Protecting one's IP through copyright is not an attempt to force a monopoly or an oligopoly in the market.
Copyright is an attempt to stop others from copying one's work. This does not force the others out of the market, it just forces them to come up with a different solution to the same problem.
&gt;There is no such thing as a copyright monopoly.
A monopoly is a state where there is only one vendor in the market.
Copyright does not enforce monopolies, as it is evident: there are thousands of copyrighted products, and there are no monopolies in any market (although there is an attempt by big companies to corner the market and drive out competition).

Nonsense. Copy""right"" gives control to the right to sell copies to only one entity, at the expense of everyone else's right. That's the definition of a monopoly.

&amp;#x200B;

This is left. Support for the disadvantaged, opposition to a clear social hierarchy. Inequalities need to be reduced or abolished. Did the Nazis support the disadvantaged? No, the Jews, Gypsies and other minorities were literally murdered. Did they support egalitarianism and social equality? No they stood for hard social hierachies with the Herrenrasse and the inferior races. Did they stand for reducing unjustified inequalities? No, they stood for increasing this as much as possible.

Let's see, did they see a certain social order/hierarchiy as inevitable, natural and desirable? Yes, Aryans should reign supreme while the rest of germany was made to serve or die. Did they base this on natural law, economics or tradition? Yes, they based it on the tradition of whites being supreme and, since they are genetically superior, natural law. Did they see the hierarchy and inequality in germany as a national result of traditional social differences? Yes. They saw it necessary to murder Jews because they encroached on ""Aryan-Soil"" and threatened germany as a whole.

&amp;#x200B;

The fact that your only arguments is that the Nazis supported a strong government. Which has nothing to do with Socialism or Left Wing at all and is an insane claim. You say socialism is about only somebody taking the means of production, so the Nazis having a total control of the country makes this socialism? Let's again look at Wikipedia here:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Socialism** is a range of [economic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_systems) and [social systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_system) characterised by [social ownership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_ownership) of the [means of production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Means_of_production) and [workers' self-management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workers%27_self-management),[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism#cite_note-10) as well as the political theories and movements associated with them.[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism#cite_note-Socialism_at_The_Free_dictionary-11) Social ownership can be [public](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_ownership), [collective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_ownership) or [cooperative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative) ownership, or [citizen ownership of equity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_ownership_of_equity).[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism#cite_note-12) There are many varieties of socialism and there is no single definition encapsulating all of them,[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism#cite_note-Peter_Lamb_2006._p._1-13) with social ownership being the common element shared by its various forms.[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism#cite_note-Busky1-5)[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism#cite_note-14)[\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism#cite_note-15) 

&amp;#x200B;

[SOCIAL ownership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_ownership) of the means of production. Workers' self management. It's about sharing the proceedings and helping the workers to lead themselves or at least work for themselves prioritized instead of being at the mercy of a company. In Nazi Germany the worker had absolutely nothing to say, to anything. If you didn't go to work because you didn't feel like it there was a good chance you were lined up against a wall and shot. This has nothing to do with Socialism.

3445," What is the name of the Nazi party? 

And here we are at the argument I tried to preemptively stop becaues it is stupid. You can give yourself any name you want, it doesn't make you what you are, your actions are. I could rename myself God-King of the US, does that give me any power in the US? Nope. The Nazis had socialism in their name to mask because it's part of the Nationalsocialism they invented and tried to push. Whose idea is to lead a country like an army to achieve a greater good, reducing the social part of the word to ""We work together on this"". This has nothing to do with classic socialism,  because it's a very different political approach. A little snippet from how ""social"" Nazis were:

&amp;#x200B;

In spite of their rhetoric condemning big business  prior to their rise to power, the Nazis quickly entered into a  partnership with German business from as early as February 1933. That  month, after being appointed Chancellor but before gaining dictatorial  powers, Hitler made a personal appeal to German business leaders to help  fund the Nazi Party for the crucial months that were to follow. He  argued that they should support him in establishing a dictatorship  because ""private enterprise cannot be maintained in the age of  democracy"" and because democracy would allegedly lead to communism.\[56\] He promised to destroy the German left and the trade unions, without any mention of anti-Jewish policies or foreign conquests 

&amp;#x200B;

They jumped from ""Big business is bad"" to ""Big business is good, everything else leads to communism"" waaaaay before the war. And actually in the same year he came to power. So everything he argued in this direction was a lie to get support.

Having a party name that is misleading if you just take a glance at it without getting any other information is very very often happening in the world. China has the ""Peoples' republic"" but it's not really lead in the best interest of the people. United Russia is the russian dictatorial party, the only reason they can ""unite"" the country is the threat of harm. It's a common trope in dictatorships because ""Party of death for everybody not our preferred people"" kinda rolls bad over the tongue. It's similar to how a lot of laws in the US get very over-the-top positive names which have nothing to do with their impact. ""Citizens United"" to give more power to big corporation over the citizens, or for example my favorite misleading law:

 

Right to Work Laws

&amp;#x200B;

Does this law for example carry the ability for workers to get proper work and fair pay? I mean it must because it's in the name, right? Nope.

  

Who wouldn’t support legislation designed to get people jobs, right?  Alas, these laws, which just recently became adopted by Wisconsin thanks  to its anti-labor governor, have the opposite effect of what they  initially seem. Instead, Right to Work laws  focus on busting up unions and union protections. Now, workers are  actually more in jeopardy of being fired without cause and having their  benefits taken away. “Right to work” is a misnomer, unless you expand  the name to be “Right to work for poverty wages until your boss finds  someone else to do the job for even cheaper.”

&amp;#x200B;

 Lefies always want death to the wrong thinkers and bring so much emotion  to economic discussions. How are Nazis similar to the GOP? Ignoring  reality and history is basically the only rebuttal you've given. 

Thanks for the assist here bro. Let's go over the first points of right wing in regards to Nazis and swap to the GOP:

Left-wing politics supports social equality and egalitarianism, often in opposition to social hierarchy.\[1\]\[2\]\[3\]\[4\] It typically involves a concern for those in society whom its adherents perceive as disadvantaged relative to others (prioritarianism) as well as a belief that there are unjustified inequalities that need to be reduced or abolished (by advocating for social justice).\[1\] The term left-wing can also refer to ""the radical, reforming, or socialist section of a political party or system"".\[5\] 

&amp;#x200B;

This is left. Support for the disadvantaged, opposition to a clear social hierarchy. Inequalities need to be reduced or abolished. Do the republicans support the disadvantaged? No, the poor, muslims and other minorities are massively suppressed and the president openly asks for violence against everybody dissenting. Do they support egalitarianism and social equality? No they stand for hard social hierachies with the monetarial leaders and the inferior serving class. Did they stand for reducing unjustified inequalities? No, they stand for increasing this as much as possible by banning muslims based on religion and colour only, by throwing Transfolk out of the military even if those would have died for their country willingly and by attacking political dissenters, trying to create an equal minded country..

 

Right-wing politics hold that certain social orders and hierarchies are inevitable, natural, normal, or desirable,\[1\]\[2\]\[3\] typically supporting this position on the basis of natural law, economics, or tradition.\[4\]:p. 693, 721\[5\]\[6\]\[7\]\[8\]\[9\] Hierarchy and inequality may be viewed as natural results of traditional social differences\[10\]\[11\] or the competition in market economies.\[12\]\[13\] The term right-wing can generally refer to ""the conservative or reactionary section of a political party or system"".\[14\] 

&amp;#x200B;

Let's see, did they see a certain social order/hierarchiy as inevitable, natural and desirable? Yes, the rich and whie should reign supreme while the rest of the US should fight for the scraps and everybody not white should be marginalized or thrown out. Because the rich work harder or at least had somebody work harder in their families past and whites are the only people able to uphold the US' culture. Do they base this on natural law, economics or tradition? Yes, they base it on the tradition of whites being supreme and, since they are morally superior by the color of their skin, natural law. Do they see the hierarchy and inequality in the US as a national result of traditional social differences? Yes. They see this as a result of some people working harder and thus getting rich and others just trying to leech of of society and thus being poor (Which, since that's the economical numbers, would be around 35% of the country).

&amp;#x200B;

They align very very hard if you look closely. And that's not emotional but a fact. As is the fact that you and your fellow rightwinger trying to make your ""enemy"" inhuman by calling them derogative terms, calling for violence against dissenters and creating obvious lies ""Lefies always want death to the wrong thinkers and bring so much emotion to economic discussions."" ""Why is Trump hurting the wrong people"" “Knock the crap out of him, would you? I promise you, I will pay your legal fees”

&amp;#x200B;

The people who want death to wrong thinkers is literally the political right in the US. Trump often has asked for violence against muslims and democrats, repeatedly. He supports rightwing terror attacks on the US soil. He said that he'll end the country if he loses presidency. Where are similar things on the left? How can you claim leftists want this when the terror from the right and even the officially pushed violence is 100 times more? This is you being biased and believing an argument supporting your stance without any support just because you want it to be true.

It really doesn't matter if its ""Chinese race"" or ""Chinese nationals"" he's trying to censor with forum spy tactics. The fact that he's using forum spy tactics is the issue. Him being a racist with his dog-whistles is just the cherry on top.

&gt;*That's the argument the PRC uses.*

No, that's the argument I use, and what US Founding Father Alexander Hamilton used. I know you're finding it difficult to think of me as an free-thinking individual since your media tells you Chinese people are unpersons incapable of rational thought, but that's just silly.

Try refuting the argument.

&gt;*Are you trying to pin this on racism too?*

Sinophobia is often a mix of both racism and geopolitics. To the average layman, you will find more racism against Chinese people to justify the political elites' decisions, who cares less for how ""different"" you are than how much of a threat you can be to their power and money.

&gt;*We're talking about other countries' policies when dealing with the PRC.*

And Italy find it in its best interests to have closer ties with China. Meanwhile, it is in Five Eyes etc.'s best interest that the world as a whole turn away from China, thus the fearmongering. Who are you to tell Italy what to do?

&gt;*That's all you're doing at this point.*

Not really, no. Pointing out your baseless argument about Africans thinking differently to African leaders without providing any evidence to support your point is just filling the air with nonsense.

&gt;*There are none of those in countries were presidents are elected for nine consecutive terms with 90%*

So you don't actually have any data to support your point of view? Interesting.

&gt;*Context is completely different.*

Not really. China invests more in developing countries because there's more projects to bring them up the world average, and less competition. Meanwhile, the US spews ""China debt trap"" propaganda despite decades of not building roads and hospitals in African or poor Eurasian countries who desperately need and wants to improve themselves.

Through the asset management company Mansvell Enterprises Limited, he controlled Skyways Express, City Airline, and Cimber Sterling aviation companies.[22] He also has media interests in the 1+1 Media Group, which operates eight Ukrainian TV channels.[13]

Kolomoyskyi has used Privat's ""quasi-military forces"" to enforce hostile takeovers of companies, sending a team of ""hired rowdies armed with baseball bats, iron bars, gas and rubber bullet pistols and chainsaws"" to forcibly take over a Kremenchuk steel plant in 2006,[26] and has used ""a mix of phony court orders (often involving corrupt judges and/or registrars) and strong-arm tactics"" to replace directors on the boards of companies he purchases stakes in.

Following the 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea the Crimean assets of Kolomoyskyi have been nationalized; according to Crimean leader Sergey Aksyonov this was ""totally justified due to the fact that he is one of the initiators and financiers of the special anti-terrorist operation in the Eastern Ukraine where Russian citizens are being killed"".[29][30]

You disappointed us long ago by portraying Erdoğan as a western-friendly ""moderate Islamist"" (as if that's a thing) progressive leader, so that's done already. You thought too simple. Erdoğan putting soldiers in jail? Must be him getting rid of potential coupists and not at all destroying the secularist faction of the army and replacing them with Gülen's brainwashed cultists which will fucking pull a coup anyway in the future, well done!

First of all nobody in Turkey cares about accession anymore. Hell, the British probably talk more about Turkey's accession process more than we do. I can't remember the last time a politician or journalist mentioned it. That ship has sailed a long time ago and any attempt to use that card will be perceived as trying to lead Turkey with a carrot which has gone rotten 10 years ago.

As someone who actually lives in Turkey and has the wonderful opportunity to see the propaganda, I can say anything said by EU will just push the ""us against them"" narrative further. I mean if EU stays silent it's not going to change anything either. It's not difficult to run out of enemies to push narratives. Anything short of economic embargo won't do jack shit. And we don't exactly need your help to fuck our economy into the dirt anyway. We are perfectly capable of achieving that on our own.

I mean, it would be good for us to join the EU.

The benefits are your comments in the past, some of which you have enjoyed making and perhaps still are proud of.

&gt;If my nation stole your nation's riches 100 years ago, back when it was not illegal (even though your nation probably objected, but who keeps score when doing a colonialism), and benefit greatly from it to this day, it is not illogical to question whether errors in the past should have consequences today. It would be pretty easy for my country to then say ""well, that was 100 years ago, the real perversion would be to do anything now.""

If it wasn't illegal, it's not ""stolen"". It's as if you declare alcohol illegal tomorrow, and seize all benefits gained by selling alcohol from the past century. That's just an ordinary cash grab - it has nothing to do with justice or morality.

You're arbitrarily opening the door.

In relation to the original question, there's a significant difference: their stay on the territory was never legal to begin with. So it would be the equivalent to a colonialist nation holding on to a piece of colony against the will of colonized, and legalize the situation when we discovered it twenty years later.

It's pretty clear you personally do not want to open the can of worms which asks whether colonialist powers have a right to the riches they ""acquired completely legally at the time, nothing to see here, let's definitely put this to the law which means we'll never have to think about it critically, let's just keep going lol"". Or, from a more common point of view, the riches they *stole*.

I don't even really care about whether we practically pay reparations or not at this point, it's just disheartening to see you continue to bang on about whether something is strictly speaking legal, because the alternative would be opening a 'can of worms' about the sins of the past.

You ask that as if it was absolutely neccecary to declair war. Also their common goal was the subjigation of Poland, not conquest of France or England,  which did not actualy enter combat until later.

Annex 1:

BREAKING NEWS: THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY HAS WITHDRAWN FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION

Because of the high net payments to the budget of the European Union, the German government decided in the late hours of the night to immediately withdraw Germany from the European Union.

The first consequences of this far-reaching decision are manifold:

1) All neighbouring states of the Federal Republic of Germany have immediately closed their borders with Germany. Entry and exit passengers have been thoroughly checked since the early hours of the morning. Queues of over 50 kilometres have formed at some border crossings.

2) France, Italy and the Benelux countries have formed a customs union in response to the German decision. All car and machine imports from Germany are now subject to a uniform import duty of 20 percent from these five countries.

3) The price of milk, beef and other foodstuffs in Germany has doubled overnight.

4) Many companies that exported their products primarily to the EU imposed short-time work during the night and threaten mass redundancies.

5) Foreign investors have begun to withdraw their capital invested in the Federal Republic of Germany and invest it in other European countries. Experts therefore believe that the labour market in Germany will collapse completely.

6) The Washington government fears a widespread destabilization of Europe and even the renewed outbreak of military conflicts in Europe.

Yeah, from the PRC he dared criticise.

That's the argument the PRC uses. All the power to them. Doesn't mean anyone else should play the game on their turf if they disagree with the rules.

&gt;  Huawei's treatment showed what happens to a Chinese company if it could actually compete against the West and capture significant market share.

Are you trying to pin this on racism too?

&gt; Not really China's problem, is it?

Germany does not challenge the US, not militarily, muxh less NATO as a whole.  Not if she spent four times what she's being asked to spend.  And the 2% applies to NATO as a whole, not just Germany, so following the level will affect all members, not just Germany.

3729,"&gt;That may be your notion of what their purpose is, but it doesn't seem to tally with what those on the far right think it is.

Of course it's not what *they* consider their own purpose. But for society as a whole.

&gt;The Overton window is system specific, 

There aren't many systems in which it has been moving to the right, until maybe 2013.

&gt;You don't need people on the extreme right to balance the extreme left, you simply need people who are not easily radicalised.

That's a nice long term goal, but as we have seen: Alinsky's ""Rules for Radicals"" actually work! Even more so in the age of social media.  

The same tactics that allow the far left to bully people into submission also work when the far right uses them. And ideally they would balance each other out, until society learns to deal with these types of attacks effectively. At which point all extremes lose their influence.

&gt;Except again, that is dependent on national norms, and frankly isn't true now. 

The quote is from Thomas Sowell, and it's of course about the US. But it applies to all anglosaxon countries, and quite a few others as well.  (the time frames differ a little)

&gt;Usually they are protesting against a flawed narriative that they have created, rather than any realistic intrusion.

We can think that they are wrong about the growing influence of Islam or the destruction of their ancestral cultures. But that *is* what they are fighting.

&gt;the same people who ~~will happily attack Gay and Lesbian groups~~ [fight ***intrusion*** from LGBT activists into their lives,] ~~attacking Islamic fundamentalists or homophobic positions~~ deriding the hypocrisy of pro-LGBT leftists that venerates Islam, while Islam teaches us to throw gays from tall buildings.

ftfy. If we're being honest about what's going on, the apparent contradiction disappears.

&gt;it is a fear of change, 

It's not fear, it's caution and respect for what has brought us this far.

The left suffers from the same kind of arrogance as angsty teenagers: they don't know enough to realize how much they don't know. 

They see that [B] is bad, and if [A] were different then [B] would be better. But they can't change [A] directly, they could change [C] and hope that it causes [A] to change, but [C] causes a thousand other things to change as well.

It's easy to notice the ""bad things"" that are happening under the status quo. It's far more difficult to understand why they happen, and how everything is related. Usually there are hundreds of levers you could try to change in order to reduce the prevalence of each type of ""bad thing"".  And they all affects each other. It's very difficult to predict what problems will arise from the changes you want to make.

&gt;Well isn't that something to look forward to.

It's a mystery why the left keeps pushing for more Islam. [The left stands to lose the most, if Islam gains control.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fswb4a9jcU)",,/r/europe/comments/b3q3l1/people_of_the_netherlands_a_reminder_of_some/ej3782f/,stereomono1,1553220240

3828,"The whole case of Europe and immigrants is getting more more dire. I am speaking with my experience of Sweden, Denmark and Germany with emphasis on Sweden where I live.  I absolutely have no issue with people of any country or any religion, etc. as long as they obey the law, respect the host culture and try making an honest living. But, as mentioned in some comments below,  the percentage of people are not having an honest living (proportion to the population of the immigrants and hosts of course), is higher in immigrants.

As it is stated in this article, immigrant criminals are getting better treatment than citizens in many cases simply because if the government does not provide them with a ""humane"" treatment they will be labeled racists, xenophobe and so on. 

The fact that governments (which are people people just working to run the country and being paid by the country) are afraid of any kind of supposed scandal or a media outbreak that an immigrant didn't get good treatment is pushing the governing body to be more and more lenient toward them. 

An example of these is the following quoted from [https://www.thelocal.se/20170208/swedish-police-officer-causes-controversy-with-facebook-post](https://www.thelocal.se/20170208/swedish-police-officer-causes-controversy-with-facebook-post) which shows a sample of offenses a police officer need to investigate: 

&gt;In [the post](https://www.facebook.com/peter.springare/posts/10208300682343230?pnref=story), Peter Springare lists what he claims to be the countries of origin and names of those he dealt with while carrying out preliminary investigations of suspected crimes in Örebro, noting that what he posted ""is not politically correct"" but that he ""doesn't give a shit"".  
&gt;  
&gt;""Suspected perpetrators: **Ali Mohamad, Mahmod, Mohammed, Mohammed, Ali, again, again, again, Christoffer**… what, is it true? Yes, a Swedish name sneaked its way in on the fringes of a drug related crime, Mohammed, Mahmod Ali, again and again,"" Springare wrote.  
&gt;  
&gt;""Countries which represent all of the week's crimes: **Iraq, Iraq, Turkey, Syria, Afghanistan, Somalia, Somalia, Syria again, Somalia, unknown country, unknown country, Sweden**,"" he added. Springare then promised to make new posts on the subject every week.  
&gt;  
&gt;A report has since been filed by police management accusing Springare of racial agitation (hets mot folkgrupp) and he is now subject to an internal investigation. He is still employed by the police while the investigation is ongoing.

I am about 1.8 meters tall, and sporty enough to manage run away from a fight, but when I am going out for groceries or train station or in the city during the night I do not feel comfortable with gangs of 4-5 men just standing smoking and littering.  That is not acceptable nor should it become a norm. I cannot let me girlfriend come home alone when she has to stay longer at work and commute back.

3884,"The whole case of Europe and immigrants is getting more more dire. I am speaking with my experience of Sweden, Denmark and Germany with emphasis on Sweden where I live. I absolutely have no issue with people of any country or any religion, etc. as long as they obey the law, respect the host culture and try making an honest living. But, as mentioned in some comments below, the percentage of people are not having an honest living (proportion to the population of the immigrants and hosts of course), is higher in immigrants.

As it is stated in this article, immigrant criminals are getting better treatment than citizens in many cases simply because if the government does not provide them with a ""humane"" treatment they will be labeled racists, xenophobe and so on.

The fact that governments (which are people people just working to run the country and being paid by the country) are afraid of any kind of supposed scandal or a media outbreak that an immigrant didn't get good treatment is pushing the governing body to be more and more lenient toward them.

An example of these is the following quoted from [https://www.thelocal.se/20170208/swedish-police-officer-causes-controversy-with-facebook-post](https://www.thelocal.se/20170208/swedish-police-officer-causes-controversy-with-facebook-post) which shows a sample of offenses a police officer need to investigate:

&gt;In the post, Peter Springare lists what he claims to be the countries of origin and names of those he dealt with while carrying out preliminary investigations of suspected crimes in Örebro, noting that what he posted ""is not politically correct"" but that he ""doesn't give a shit"".  
""Suspected perpetrators: **Ali Mohamad, Mahmod, Mohammed, Mohammed, Ali, again, again, again, Christoffer**… what, is it true? Yes, a Swedish name sneaked its way in on the fringes of a drug related crime, Mohammed, Mahmod Ali, again and again,"" Springare wrote.  
""Countries which represent all of the week's crimes: **Iraq, Iraq, Turkey, Syria, Afghanistan, Somalia, Somalia, Syria again, Somalia, unknown country, unknown country, Sweden**,"" he added. Springare then promised to make new posts on the subject every week.  
A report has since been filed by police management accusing Springare of racial agitation (hets mot folkgrupp) and he is now subject to an internal investigation. He is still employed by the police while the investigation is ongoing.

I am about 1.8 meters tall, and sporty enough to manage run away from a fight, but when I am going out for groceries or train station or in the city during the night I do not feel comfortable with gangs of 4-5 men just standing smoking and littering. That is not acceptable nor should it become a norm. I cannot let me girlfriend come home alone when she has to stay longer at work and commute back.

3934,"&gt; Honestly curious about that part. I read the latest version of the text and I didn't find the part I highlighted in bold.

I was a bit sceptical when you linked to a non-official website as usually those versions are hopelessly outdated, but a quick comparison revealed that indeed this is the preliminary agreement. 

To answer your question though, the part highlighted in bold can be found in Article 13(5), which stipulates that the cooperation must not lead to the prevention of publication of legitimate works, including those covered by the exception. 

&gt; Certainly, the law as it is right now (remember when article 13 only had three paragraphs? Good times XD) recognizes the rights of quotation, criticism, review, caricature, etc., mentions a promising obligation to put in place ""an effective and expeditious complaint and redress mechanism"" for users in case of disputes, and authorities have to take into account the size, the audience and the works of the service.

Before moving on I want to quickly mentioned that those exceptions did not exist everywhere yet. They were allowed to be made by member states, as by Directive 2001/29/EC Article(5), but they were optional. Not mandatory. While I do not know specifically which member states did not implement which exceptions, the Commission identified Ireland and the United Kingdom as two member states that do not allow you to make private copies of copyrighted works. While not directly related, it does demonstrate that member states do go quite far in _not_ implementing exceptions. 

&gt; But measures against avoiding systems prone to false positives (AKA filters and content ID technologies)? Where did you find it? Did I miss it?

While this is true, Content-ID technologies have a different purpose than is required. They try to find duplicates _and_ derivatives. If you record a cover of a song (illegal without permission), Content-ID tries to remove that. 

However, legally speaking, derivatives are not the same work as their original. They are different works protected under different copyright. There is no indication in the law that websites would have to make a best effort against preventing the upload of derivations of infringing content.

Without having to detect derivations, these technologies can become a lot more precise, and flag a lot less false positives. 

However, if you are not convinced that derivations must not be detected - which I would love to see evidence of if you do maintain that stance - Article 13(5) makes any measures that reliable do detect derivations technologically impossible. According to Recital 38b in those cases platforms are allowed to completely rely on rightholders notifying the platform of individual infringements - and thus keep the current rules under Directive 2000/31/EC Article 14.

No need for snide remarks. Sure we can agree that events lead up to the bombing. Would you agree that the bombing should have targeted military forces perpetrating violence, rather than the entire nation's infrastructure. And that the many civilian deaths as a result of NATO intervention shouldn't have happened? Deaths of both Albanians and Serbians for that matter. That NATO should have made an effort to avoid killing innocent people, rather than brushing them off as collateral damage? If the goal was to stop the violence, then target the violence.

3965,"&gt;For example, if I were to fight for my country Germany, I would not be just fighting for people whose parents and grandparents were born within a certain boundary on the soil. I would be fighting for all people who live here and as citizens form the country, regardless of ethnic background.

Right, you'd be fighting for your country, and your nation (and practically a host of personal relationships). 'Nation' doesn't exclude people based on ethnic makeup, it's not synonymous with the kind of ethno-nationalism that seems to be getting popular in some parts, it isn't dependent on race. Some people may well see it as such, some people may use it as such, bit it is most often still used to describe a both the territory and the people within that territory.

&gt;The terms are only synonymous for someone who subscribes to the idea of ""Germany for (ethnic) Germans"". I don't.

It think you may have that slightly backwards. They are synonymous if you don't subscribe to the idea of a separate 'German nation' based on ethnicity, if you take the positions that Germany as a nation and Germany as a country is the same thing (which I'd bet most people do) then you are including everyone, regardless of ethnicity in that definition. 

You actively have to take an ethnically focused view to end up with two different 'Germanies' in that context.

&gt;What? I thought you recognized Kosovos independence, and if you do you must also agree that these ethnic Serb children are as much citizens of the country and should enjoy the same rights. You can't have it both ways. If Kosovo as a independent state fail to be a state for both ethnic groups (Serbs and Albanians) what was the point of making it a brand new country.

As I said, they have every right to live and learn, and Kosovo constitution grants that right to its every citizen. And the government enforces it.

It's Belgrade that does not want them to be part of Kosovo, and uses them by making false promises that someday Kosovo will be a part of Serbia again.

The Serbs in other parts of Kosovo except those in the north bordering Serbia, have accepted the reality and live peacefully with all their neighbours, no matter the ethnicity. ",,/r/europe/comments/b3r5s9/serbian_kids_from_kosovo_traveling_to_school_in_a/ej2oexk/,ChaoticSkyVector,1553205680

4087,"&gt;Fingers crossed, but I am not so sure about that. 

The reason it's likely is that it is a different proposition to the current process. Right now the EU has nothing to gain at all from the UK leaving the EU (ignoring entirely what our views are about the UK's future). It's entirely a lose lose in terms of influence, size and everything else. There is no upside. 

Once the UK is outside of the EU framework it becomes something of a different proportion. All the 'loss' is gone, any relationship will be based on what benefit the EU can arrive at. It won't be anywhere near as close as the current situation for obvious reasons, but there are a slew of areas where the UK and EU are likely to want to cooperate. Even in areas like trade, obviously the UK leaving the SM is a massive stop down in terms of EU access to the UK (again, not suggesting that it's good for the UK, just looking at it from that side) so anything that creates more access for EU firms will be seen as a win, much like any trade deal with any other non-EU state.

&gt;The EU might just focus on survival &amp; further integration

It might, although I don't think there is much in terms o risk to the EU's survival at the moment.. And the UK won't be particularly interested in the EU's internal integration pushes, if anything it'll be nice not to be inolved.

&gt;I think like after each break-up the ""let's stay friends"" mood will vanish soon. The UK has a couple of traditional friends in the EU like Portugal or the Netherlands, but those aren't the heavy-weights.

I sort of hope the relationship analogies fall away at some point.. The EU is currently having to manage a set of political pressures relating to internal populism and external idiocy from the likes of Trump and Russia (And pressure from China). Where the UK goes is relevant there, I'm pretty sure they'd prefer the UK in the EU's 'sphere' rather than anywhere else if they can manage it. The UK I'd assume is going to try very hard to end up in no single sphere..

4142,"Don't get me wrong, when I say that complying with the law is possible, I don't necessarily mean from a technological point of view. It most certainly cannot - and this is easily provable. I can produce any number of non-trivial transformations of works and publish them and there won't be any technological means available to detect them.

What I mean is that the businesses will enter into agreements where they either will use specific services, whether they be filters, content servers, or whatnot, provided or koshered by the rights holders associations or similar or simply pay depending on traffic or other similar factors such as users/day. 

&gt; Most OCSSPs already comply with most provisions in the law

For some reason I never see an answer to this question: If most of them are complying why is Article 13 necessary?

&gt; Because the arguments put forward usually not only directly contradict what the law actually says, but they're usually identifical to the talking point of the lobby.

That is not what you can find in these threads. To the contrary what we can observe usually are pro-accounts repeating very similar lines, usually that of dismissing those with concerns. Of course there are also some concern trolling going on. I mean for those users who have many years spent on here, these kinds of activities are readily recognisable.

&gt; That's a low bar.

Still one of the better ones. Subs which have decent moderation, the quality of content can be unmatched.

&gt; The people who claim to be experts usually have not read the law. Seriously.

Anyone claiming to be an expert here is the one who should be questioned. There simply is no precedent for something like this to even be possible to know what can be the outcome. We only can find technological experts, legal experts, and specific experts in their own fields.

So experts claiming that everything is going to be rosy and that these measures are good for everyone including the users and citizens, etc... are falling on deaf ears for the many, hence no minds are changed towards the promoters' side, but the contrary actually occurs, precisely because of some of this attitude seen by the promoters. At some point it may be even helpful not to carry on the pro PR, honestly.

I am okay with cultural and fundamental minority rights, but I am against autonomy. Turkey is a unitarian nation-state, and such autonomy for Kurds, in Turkey, or Syria, through PKK and its allies/branches, is an existential threat for Turkey and the stability in region. 

Turks have 2 majority Turkish regions in Bulgaria, one referred to as *Deliorman*, in north, the other in south near the Turkish border centered in Kırcâli, which also used to be in the first Turkish republic in history, the Republic of Western Thrace in 1913. The Turkish-majority area in south Bulgaria today almost exactly correspond to borders of this republic. I do not know if you support language rights, publishing rights, minority and culture rights, including return and protection of cultural property of Turks in Bulgaria which were damaged and confiscated during communism. Sounds like you do support to some extent. Yet, would you support if these Turks wanted an autonomous state, raising the flag they used in 1913, and the Turkish-party in Bulgaria would have an associate paramilitary group carrying terror attacks around Bulgaria and the Turkish majority regions in neighboring areas in Greece?

So in 2015 they became part of the 3-party right-wing/conservative coalition government, which has gone on to be pretty much as corporate-favouring as might be expected, regardless of the establishment protest history of the party in question.

We're having elections on April 14, and a couple of years ago the ""Finns"" split into two, as the other coalition parties refused to work with the newly-selected even more anti-immigration head of the party.

I am an Irish citizen by birth. I was born in the republic. My family moved to the north of england  about a decade ago.

My dad was an English citizen. Born not far from where I now live. Because of the long and storied history between England and Ireland, Irish people in the UK are automatically considered naturalised. Because of this it's absurdly easy for me to become an English citizen.

I have an Irish passport already. However as I love in the UK I am also applying for a UK passport post-brexit.

I am not from Northern Ireland myself, however citizen of Northern Ireland are considered to be both British and Irish. Both options are availible to them.

As such there are people living in NI who consider themselves Irish, have Irish passports and live and work on opposite side sof the border.

Platforms have to:

1. As main purpose allow independent users to submit their own copyrighted works.
2. As main purpose publish those works.
3. As main purpose organise those works for profit.
4. As main purpose promote those works for profit.
5. Have a large amount of copyrighted works already.
6. Not be a digital encyclopedia.
7. Not offer communication services like chats or telephone.
8. Not offer business-to-business services. (excludes e.g. Netflix) 
9. Not broadcast content. (Content must only be supplied at the individual request. Things like streaming broadcast even without demand and are excluded.)

When they meet these criteria, as well are at least 3 years or have at least ten million monthly visitors, they have to:

1. Prove they made a best effort to try and obtain authorisation.
2. Prove they took offline illegitimate content when they were sent a transparent and substantiated takedown notice.
3. Prove they made a best effort to take offline any future copies of the content taken down under (2). Additionally, allow right holders to sent copies of their content pre-emptively.

If they comply with all three of these, they are not liable.

Additionally, when determining what a best effort is, a judge shall consider, amongst other things:

1. The size of the service, the nature of the audiance, and the cost of implementing the effort. Too expensive systems are not expected to be used.
2. Whether the effort causes legitimate content to go offline. Efforts that detect false positives are prohibited. Your effort can cause blatent duplicate contents to get through, but it cannot cause legitimate content, including derivations like parodies, reviews or criticisms to be blocked. (These didn't use to be protected in all of the EU.)

Additionally the European commission shall help the member states organise stakeholder dialogues between online content sharing service providers, right holders and users, to create guidelines to help OCSSPs by providing them guidelines. These are non-binding but can be useful for smaller businesses who don't have legal expertise to comply.

Then, if an OCSSPs breaks the law and makes an effort that violates the users' rights by taking offline their legitimate content, there shall be three ways the users can rectify this:

1. There must be an appeal procedure provided by the online content sharing service provider themselves, which allows users to appeal takedowns. These appeals shall be acted on quickly, must lead to legitimate content being rectified and must be subject to human decision. OCSSPs shall not make public the user's identity, not even to the rightholders, and respect their right to privacy. 
2. There shall be an impartial body set up by the member states where users can appeal takedowns by platforms.
3. The two aforementioned systems shall not prevent a user from bringing the matter to court.

Finally, if a user was found to have made a copyright infringement, unless they tried to profit off of it, they will be cleared from all liability. ",Belgium,/r/europe/comments/b3n6gb/i_panicked_when_i_saw_this/ej14w9v/,JBinero,1553169152

could you elaborate link tax? [this is the latest version](https://juliareda.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Copyright_Final_compromise.pdf) of the directive (taken from julia reda webiste)

I have to be wrong here, so please let me know where am I wrong:

-  These rights shall not apply to private or non-commercial uses of press publications carried out by individual users.

- The protection granted under the first subparagraph shall not apply to acts of hyperlinking. as per wikipedia: 

&gt; In computing, a hyperlink, or simply a link, is a reference to data that the reader can directly follow either by clicking or tapping.

isn't this what reddit is already doing? 

- The rights referred to in the first subparagraph shall not apply in respect of uses of individual words or very short extracts of a press publication. *how short? it's up to member state right?* 

- The rights referred to in paragraph 1 shall expire 2 years after the publication of the press publication.

I hadn't read his further posts, they funnily enough could be attributed to a shill, although to one promoting the ""China bad"" simplistic viewpoint. He also said ""Chinese"", rather than ""China"", but I assume that was just simplification as I don't see anyone calling for the boycott of Taiwan.

Nevertheless, I can't agree with you that being against further ""integration"" with the PRC is racist per se (it could be a motive for some, sure, but it doesn't need to be). The PRC's government has shown times and times again that it wouldn't play nice to any kind of outside pressure or rule, that multinational frameworks' duties would vastly be discarded and that reciprocity in trade and law wasn't in its playbook. Some may legitimately object to offering their country's physical and intellectual capital when the other party offers nothing of the sort in exchange. It could ultimately be construed as eroding a people's sovereignty in exchange of short term gains for a minority within that people, which, depending on your own philosophy, might be worth preventing.

&gt; PS: If you still don't see it, substitute ""Chinese"" with ""Jewish"" and ""China"" with ""Israel"".

The answer: Brexit was not a general election, but a referendum.

It was literally an opinion poll. That is all it was. Not legally binding, not subject to the Electoral Commission (if it had been, the result would've been discounted due to Leave campaign's crimes). Parliament *chose* to stupidly say ""Ok we're gonna revoke article 50 quickly rather than scrutinizing possible options and figuring out what they actually want, hard or soft Brexit, etc"".

So, because it was an opinion poll, it does not have a fixed term like a parliamentary election. People's opinion can change.

Lastly- unlike electing MPs for 5 years or so, Brexit is a permanent move, stripping us all of EU citizenship for the rest of our lives.

4782,"&gt;*Nevertheless, I can't agree with you that being against further ""dealings"" with the PRC is racist per se (it could be a motive for some, sure, but it doesn't need to be).*

It's a racist dog-whistle I pointed out because of a combination of factors, first requiring grouping everyone on his side ""anyone in the West"" and versus the out-group ""the Chinese"". Again, if you don't see it, just sub in ""Chinese"" with other groups like ""the blacks"" or ""the jews"". This wouldn't be considered racist by itself, but combining with the fact he called China ""thieving and merchantilist"" and that he's repeatedly use shill accusations in multiple threads just for disagreeing with him on China (this is his second time calling me a shill after I defended another user against his bullshit earlier), makes me believe there's a xenophobic angle on this.

&gt;*The PRC's government has shown times and times again that it wouldn't play nice to any kind of outside pressure or rule*

That's just not true, given the fact that PRC abides by WTO rules more consistently than America. If you disagree, we can argue more in-depth on the subject matter.

&gt;*Some may legitimately object to offering their country's physical and intellectual capital when the other party offers nothing of the sort in exchange.*

That's also blatantly untrue, given the fact that foreign investment into China has continued at a rapid pace for decades. Claiming this has been done without mutual profit to some degree is rather silly. Again, I can debate this with you.

&gt;*It could ultimately be construed as eroding a people's sovereignty*

Anyone can be construed as erosion of sovereignty. The fact remains that Italy/African countries/SEA/East Europe etc. agreed to Chinese loans because people in their government thought it would be beneficial to them. Who are you to pretend they are children who cannot take care of themselves? Chinese interest rates are no more predatory than those from World Bank/IMF/ADB. I can also talk further about this if you want, but we should stick to one topic at a time.

No democracy is perfect... at least the way we implement them in our countries. Sometimes we do fail and it's ok to accept that and move on. British citizens made a decision without having the facts. The fault is on the politicians side. They had all the facts, this decision should be theirs to make.

Imho, revoking article 50 is the best way to proceed (if you feel that you belong to EU that is). EU press and politicians might have a little fun at you, making jokes and memes, but at the end of the day you would be stopping a questionable decision.

The term astroturfing is derived from AstroTurf, a brand of synthetic carpeting designed to resemble natural grass, as a play on the word ""grassroots"".

This allows China to simultaneously have policies like buying USD or Euro with their offshore currency to make their exports competitive and also have tons of money printing locally to stimulate the economy, but since it doesn't float, it's fine.

They collect(ed) trillions in arbitrage with their crap currency by having companies like Apple or any European company overpay for their crappy onshore currency at an unfair/artifical rate converting from the offshore currency.

Besides. Its not that the EU was being difficult at all. The UK just needs to pick where its wants its border, because it wont be part of the economic european zone, if it wants the autonomy of trade deals. That's just how it works, there is no negotiation. It's going to be hart as hard-brexit.

And the big problem is the UK can't pick a place where they want the border. The EU has been super reasonable. The UK just need to .. pick and they can't. They dont want it in NI. They dont want in the ocean (NI part of EEZ). They don't want it around the Islands (no brexit). 

Its not even May's fault. UK needs a cival war or something, because there is no compromis possible internally. This is not the EU being difficult, just setting 'relationship breakers'. 

The slides that got leaked/shared by the EU at the beginning of the negotiation where a buffet of potential new types of relationship. But the EU itself predicted that a hard brexit was impossible and everything would come down to 'where does the border go'.

5047,"So what would you do?  What does ""leave"" mean?

(a) stay in the european economic zone (no autonomy on trade deals -- we only do those with the whole bloc at once). The border passings could stay where they are now. Is that honoring 'leave' though?

(b) put the borders around the UK, which implies putting borders in NI. This is unacceptable to the UK because it would trigger a cival war. Those border checks would be a war zone, palistina/israel style.

(c) put the borders in between the two islands, and keep NI part of the European Economic Zone. This would isolate the unionist in NI and inevitably lead to the NI leaving the UK and joining Ireland.

You have to pick one of these though. If you leave there are going to be borders.  

But neither (a), (b) nor (c) has a political majority in the UK. About half wants to 'leave' (or at least respect the vote), about half wants to 'remain' anyway. And of the half that wants to respect the vote, each of these three locations for a border has about 1/3 of the political support. 

So what would you pick? And how would you convince a majority of the people in the UK to accept that location?

A unified trade policy would could only give a favourable outcome to either UK or Germany. EU Army, so a vote is passed to stand up to Russia by declaring war on them. UK doesn't wish to. UK either vetoes, or is compelled to commit troops to a war it isn't interested in.

True, but you can make the case within the UK the approach is different? What if Scotland wants to stay in the EU but the UK majority wants to leave? Does it drags Scotland out of the EU? Yes. Likewise with arm sales you've mentioned, if the UK wanted to sell arms but the majority of EU for example wouldn't want to sell arms, majority wins ofcourse, it's democracy. I don't understand how can you have double standards regarding Scotland-UK relations and UK-EU relations (we are talking here about federalized UK-EU relations)


&gt;And what would the EU army do if Russia continued murdering people. Vote to invade Russia? Presumably this would require a unanimous decision from 27 member states. What if one member state is swayed by Russian influence and votes against?

I can give you one simple example from real life. Does Russia covertly murders people in the US? No. Why? Because they would be crazy to do that considering US strength. The same logic would apply to federalized EU. UK is a joke country compared would the federalized EU would be (UK with all of other EU members on top), of course Russia can do whatever it wants to the UK but when we talk about EU (again, federalized so you don't misinterpret) they wouldn't dare, none will invade Russia because Russia itself would be scared to play dirty games with big boy EU. UK is not a weak country don't get me wrong but uncomparable to the EU.

If it's their property, it remains their property. But they will need to show a passport or ID in order to cross the border, also there will trunk checks, scans, stuff like that. EU's policy is that there must be a hard border between EU and non-EU countries. Cyprus citizens can live in bases area 90 days within 180 days per year without visa/residence permit. But owning a property in another country doesn't grant you a visa/residence permit *per se*. That will have to be dealt with UK immigration.... somehow.

5132,"&gt;Denark has it's own special deals.


(Denmark)


Yes we have, because our constitution demands a vote when giving away any kind of sovereignty. That resulted in a no vote to the Maastricht treaty. But very different from UK, Denmark entered negotiations to remain, with exceptions on those issues, and a new vote was held on the new agreement which passed.


We could have blocked the Maastricht treaty, because it required that all countries ratified it. Or we could have decided to leave EU for a position much like Norway.


Obviously it would have been wildly unpopular in EU if we had blocked the new treaty, and instead of leaving we got the special deal. It was never a shitshow like we've seen from UK. Our government handled it way more elegantly than in UK, and stated it was up to the parties who voted no to define what that actually meant. The government and ""no"" campaigning parties reached an agreement which was negotiated with EU, the following vote was actually a vote to either pass what the government had negotiated, now supported by all parties, or alternatively leave EU. The deal was passed by voters.


Regarding the exceptions we are actually participating in most of it, one exception was to not adopt the Euro, but we follow the rules of the Euro-zone to the letter, and the exchange rate is kept extremely tight, to a point where it can be considered near 100% reliable.


For UK there was no constitutional requirement for the vote, but the vote was held anyway without a plan. And when the vote resulted in Brexit, the political efforts to figure out how to make it work has been as taken out of a Monty Python movie. When May said Brexit means Brexit, it's probably one of the most idiotic things I've ever heard a British prime minister state. Because it was never actually determined what Brexit means, and it still isn't determined after 2½ years now.


Yes Denmark has special deals, and we respect them, and are thankful EU allow them and that we can stay in EU.


UK has even more special deals, similar exceptions but also a huge rebate.",Denmark,/r/europe/comments/b3e4l4/not_a_single_uk_poll_has_shown_a_majority_for/eizq275/,Buffalox,1553118926

But at the same time people that knew him characterized him as mentally ill (combined with a history alcohol and drug abuse) rather than an extremist. And also, the number of victims, and the pattern of his targeting seem a bit inconsistent with that, as some of the victims were hit outside the tram (if you suddenly start shooting completely unsuspecting people in a tram carriage, you'd think you'd have have dozens of easy targets locked up in a very tight space).

5194,"&gt; What if Scotland wants to stay in the EU but the UK majority wants to leave?

Because Scotland voted against independence from the UK, and the UK voted to leave.

&gt; I don't understand how can you have double standards regarding Scotland-UK relations and UK-EU relations

I don't see the double standard?

&gt; Likewise with arm sales you've mentioned, if the UK wanted to sell arms but the majority of EU for example wouldn't want to sell arms, majority wins ofcourse, it's democracy.

Why would we agree to that if it clearly doesn't benefit us? 

&gt; Because they would be crazy to do that considering US strength.

Yes, the US is a single country.

&gt; The same logic would apply to federalized EU.

Except it would have to agree to any action. How could you justify something as significant as war without unanimous consent?

&gt; in a federalized EU there is no notion of country veto, you have British members of the parliament representing you in the EU parliament, like in the US, California cannot veto a US foreign policy, same would apply to the EU

Great, so we are simultaneously committed to British troops fighting and dying for any cause the EU deems necessary, yet if Russia invaded the UK we would rely on the EU voting to assist the UK?

5209,"I know I sound like a doomsayer every time I point this out, but I like reading histories. I have read this chapter, multiple times. We are in the chapter where it's incredibly obvious to everyone that the big horrible thing is about to happen, except to the people of the time.

We're in the ""Peace in out time"", the ""Austrian ultimatum to Serbia"", the ""the South refuses to let Lincoln even be on the ballot"" chapter. 

The only difference being that rather than one potentially horrible thing, we have dozens. 

You want war? Russia pushes further in to Ukraine. Skirmishes on the India Pakistan border blow up, China makes a move for Taiwan,  the US invades Iran.

You want human made natural disasters? No problem. Did you know that there are huge craters being created in Siberia by methane frozen in permafrost thawing a blowing up. That's a thing. Big storm turns millions of people in to refugees? You bet. Massive droughts doing the same? Of course.

How about economics? Short term bonds now have higher yields than long term bonds. This means that the markets do not believe the long term outlook is good and is a frequent indicator of economic calamity. China's construction bubble might pop. The Iran Saudi conflict might heat up leading to the closure of the strait of Hormuz and the aforementioned US-Iran war, but more importantly for this paragraph, a huge spike in oil prices.

How about internal strife?  Who wants a civil war in Venezuela? How about a coup in Brazil? State sponsored man hunt part 2 in the Philippines? Maybe have a do-over with the Troubles. Or maybe we have a classic, the Second Spanish Civil war to really hit the ""history repeats it self"" note.

All of this could be nothing, could cause a local catastrophe, could cause a global catastrophe or could be triggered by a global catastrophe.  

How is this relevant? Glad you asked. Here's a simple question, what happen if there's violence on the Irish border? What does the UK do? What does the EU do? Do we deescalate and find a common solution, do we effectively quarantine the region and let the violence play out or do we escalate. 

Far more wars were started by cowards who felt they had no choice but to resort to violence than by would be conquerors and if there's one thing we don't lack it's cowards ready to do the wrong thing for all the wrong reasons.

The most advanced artillery with guided ammunition M777 has a deviation of 15 meters from the target. Without guidance and without M777 artillery can deviate to as much as 80 meters from the target zone. It's why barrages are employed. Mortars of rocket artillery are even worse. 

I'm fully aware of all this, but again, they did purposefuly target the civilians, but with limited attacks, to make sure they don't kill them, just make it unbearable for them so they have to run.

&gt;Army was stationed within and if the shelling simply contintued it would have been a war crime, as was shown by Sarajevo sentence, but Croat ground forces advancing into towns shortly shows that artillery use was justified as part of an operation and not an intent to terrorize civilians. 

Yet it did terrorize civilians, and based on their plan of causing an exodus through fear, did the job perfectly. Of course they moved in afterwards, when the civilians already started moving.

5391,"&gt; On Farage, you might want to start here, then go here, maybe here as well.

Source 1 is an interview in which Farage explicitly denies receiving Russian funding apart from in some journalistic work for Russia Today, so I'm not exactly sure what that's meant to be proof of. Source 2 is about Arron Banks and Andy Wigmore, and isn't able to link Farage to anything. Source 3 is purely speculative and based on the fact that ""Farage's name keeps coming up"" in a probe which has completely failed to find any links between Trump and Russia. So again, absolutely no proof that Farage is a Russian stooge, as you claimed. Just a lot of hot air from heavily pro-Remain journalists. 

&gt;On Le Pen, you definitely should read this.

Ok, so that's a more conclusive link. The French banks refused to issue loans to Le Pen's party, so they turned abroad instead. But is there any evidence that Russia is actually influencing her actions, or does it just support her stance? Given that her family have been involved in the FN for decades before Putin even entered politics, it's pretty dubious to suggest that he's influencing their policy.

&gt;On Salvini, this.

Again, the article admits that there is no actual evidence, just speculation. And even if the claims were true, it seems like a similar case to Le Pen, where his party were denied loans from the sources available to mainstream parties, and sought alternatives instead.

&gt;Happy?

Not nearly as happy as I'd be if you could actually provide evidence for your claim that these politicians are ""well-documented Russian stooges"". 

&gt;You mean like the European Parliament?

Maybe like that, if they had more power than the European Commission. I'd be happy for some form of European Parliament to remain to deal with the issues that can only be solved at an individual level, but I'd still want to strip some of their powers and devolve them to the local level.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/b30btp/eu_countries_really_exhausted_by_brexit/eiz39u2/,NathanNance,1553104806

5420,"&gt; We're talking about forms of fascism and how what we perceive as fascism. You made a point how 50 years ago sharing of ideas wasn't possible at this extent with fascists, and I made a point how perceived fascism has changed since then. Far right of today is not fascist, whereas Islam is inherently fascist, ergo what's the punishment for leaving Islam? I hope I have simplified the discussion to level where you can take part in it

You didn't consider islamism to be fascist at the beginning of the discussion. You don't consider the Christchurch shooter a fascist. Brave. Still backtracking and covering your ass for your illogical positions though.

&gt; We're talking about radicalization of violent ideas and their relation to gun laws and internet, not about NZ but how our situation is akin to their situation.

NZ decidedly is relevant to this topic, as the original commenter was talking about.

&gt; Nazi-Germany recruited plenty of Americans without the use of internet

Good thing ISIS didn't have the state infrastructure that Germany did then.

&gt; Can you name few then? (I'm guessing you can't)

The entire 1940s. Amusing how you didn't get what I meant by no attacks taking place against Greeks in Turkey. The holocaust was a success, Jews aren't a minority large enough to be a target for Europeans anymore. There are bigger fish to fry.

&gt; Sure, we can keep adding to the list of non-existent and made up things if you want

To be clear: You are claiming that there have been no lethal terror attacks against muslims in Europe?

&gt; Sure, NZ was not of course, but I don't see how that's a issue when talking about censoring internet or having stricter gun laws in Europe (And I sincerely hope I don't need to reiterate this again if you fail to realize the context)

The original point was about the trade-off of between preventing the spread of violent ideology and actual prevention of violence. You are already on the side of censoring the internet in Europe (wanna guess before the end of the sentence?), you just don't want your violent tribe to be censored. It's isis btw, everything they get up to is legally censored.

&gt; Of course we are talking about those things, but you somehow keep talking about NZ incident after one attack as it was widespread problem

Global terror is a relatively new phenomenon. It is a widespread problem and all of its forms share this feature.

&gt; Obviously you have failed to do so, since you feel the need to point that out for you, if you had quoted me in full earlier you would've had answered your own question

This does not make grammatical sense. And you are not in a position to determine what context I've been speaking in.

&gt; NZ was brought in the discussion how we(As in American telling Europeans) have the same problems as them.. When was last Muslim massacre (As in not started by Muslim against Europeans of course) or Jewish massacre?

That is not how it was brought into the discussion. The topic is different and NZ is supposed to be a parallel in that New Zealand can't prevent the importation and spread of violent ""alt-right"" ideology without limiting communication or alternatively limiting capacity for violence. The suggestion was that tax evasion is similar: You can't stop tax evasion without other countries agreeing to do the same or diminishing trade (like censoring the internet).

working class people have far less resources available, they live in worse neighborhoods which means they go to worse schools.

5493,"Hello Mr. Wölken from Germany. Thanks for the AMA

If I understand correctly, this new copyright directive makes social media platforms liable if copyrighted work is available on their site without agreement by the copyright holder. Thus installing upload filters is the only solution to avoid legal liability.

Is this only the rule for uploading content or does the access of content fall under this too? Let's say an American user posts something on Twitter, that would be blocked by the filter if a European user were to upload it, could European users still see the post? Or would the European user only see a ""this post is blocked in your country on copyright grounds"" message instead of the post?

I am an independent game developer and freelance artist. The copyright directive concerns me, because I don't have a marketing budget do advertise my game and artwork. I 100% rely on the viral nature of the internet to make my brand known. If the viral success of my work fails because it ends up being blocked all over the web because of a flawed and abusive filter system, it could greatly hurt my career.

We'll see what turnout is like this time. 

We actually learned about the European Union in school, just like we did with our national government, but only in High School, so the less educated are unlikely to vote. Still, it does mean that we have a fairly good basis for doing so here, though it has only become a compulsory course a few years ago, so the impact will only be seen later. Education though is a state, not Union, competency, so if people in any given state are ignorant about the Union, that's on the state. 

The EU has actually produced very good and understandable educational resources on the Union, but you usually have to look for them, because as said the Union doesn't control the actual education system. I have had informational booklets and the like handed out to me by pro-EU NGOs at events or conventions, and I know there were simple mostly picture booklets about EU member states for children produced by the EU.

The bias you have is that you assume that everyone is the same it is just question of money. You ignore completely culture.

&gt;That is not an aim of anyone. It's insane to think it is. You don't aim for Muslim immigrants to become carbon copies of ethnic Hungarians. Just like how the ethnic Jews and Germans and Croats aren't quarantined until they shed every last ounce of their distinct identities. Just like how Poles who move to Western Europe aren't forced to live a complete imitation of Dutch, Brit, Norwegian life, even if they stay there til they die. There isn't a single right way to live a life, even if your myopia tells you otherwise. We have values, those values define a wide range of what's acceptable by the majority and a much narrower part of what's unacceptable. You need to stay inside the limits of the first one. 

Well then you have a problem here. Because on one hand you want them to change and then you say you don't want them to change.

You can't have it both. In case of Poles, Hungarians, Jews etc you are talking about groups that have similar things in mind and only vary on minimal things.

Smiling is a cultural expression. Does shaking hands mean Westerners are politer than Asians who bow?

&gt; People who make more money tend to report higher positive emotions. Last year, there was a 10-percentage-point gap globally between the highest and lowest income brackets. But not all data suggest money buys happiness. Previous research in the United States found that when these same metrics are used, a higher income level makes a significant impact on a person's overall happiness, but only up to $75,000. Above that level, income makes much less of a difference.

So why are some of the poorest countries ranked top 10 in their index?

&gt; Denmark is notable because except for one year, it has always been No. 1 when it comes to the percentage of people who rate their lives positively enough to be considered ""thriving.""

5621,"At least having a withdrawal agreement would cushion the blow at least for the time being. No deal the UK would be crashing out onto the bare minimum and to a relationship that no country has in the world. Even if there is no official trade deal with the EU, they still have some form of agreements with the EU. The the EU makes up 45% of the UK’s trade and many other EU countries have connected supply chains with the UK, that would be severely limited if the UK was to end up in that situation. I am also not convinced by the argument that it would teach the UK a lesson. If anything I am more convinced that the EU would get the blame for not giving the UK a good deal and would be seen as a bully. Which is a narrative that anti-EU parties can sell elsewhere in Europe. Rather than it being because that British parliament were utterly incompetent and refused to compromise on anything.

I also think you fail to understand the situation with Northern Ireland and how tensions are within that place. Never mind how intergrated things are on that island so treating it as effectively two countries would create a lot of problems. Not only for NI but also for Ireland who would still stay an EU member. 

It would also created more new problems as the UK parliament would be spending so much time trying to manage this stupid thing and then would likely need to negotiate a trade deal with the EU as the current situation would be quite destructive. 

So I think that many people on here actively wishing no deal are rather misguided and would just create a lot of new problems, that didn’t exist before. For both the UK and the EU. I just honestly wished that David Cameron never called his stupid referendum, in the first place and I am sick to death of people hiding around the democracy excuse, which is even worse when many of them call the prospect of holding another one as being undemocratic.

a) the present tory government remains, nothing changes. 

b) labour gets in, corbyn asks to renegotiate, the EU says it will not re-open the withdrawal agreement so parliament has to vote again on the deal that May asked them to vote for and failed and it would most likely fail again.

We're talking about forms of fascism and how what we perceive as fascism. You made a point how 50 years ago sharing of ideas wasn't possible at this extent with fascists, and I made a point how perceived fascism has changed since then. Far right of today is not fascist, whereas Islam is inherently fascist, ergo what's the punishment for leaving Islam? I hope I have simplified the discussion to level where you can take part in it

&gt;We have since the beginning, since the comment you replied to was talking about New Zealand.

We're talking about radicalization of violent ideas and their relation to gun laws and internet, not about NZ but how our situation is akin to their situation.

&gt;Again, not the point. ISIS recruited via the internet as well, if the internet was not a thing the recruitment from Europe would likely have been lower or based on recruiting militants rather than locally-sourced suicide bombers.

Nazi-Germany recruited plenty of Americans without the use of internet

&gt;Plenty. There are barely any left to bother. Like how there are no attacks against Greeks in Turkey.

Can you name few then? (I'm guessing you can't)

&gt;The threat was not made up in New Zealand. You also didn't ask the actual reverse: How many attacks in Europe by right wingers against muslims which ended up in their death?

Sure, we can keep adding to the list of non-existent and made up things if you want

Sure, NZ was not of course, but I don't see how that's a issue when talking about censoring internet or having stricter gun laws in Europe (And I sincerely hope I don't need to reiterate this again if you fail to realize the context)

&gt;We're talking about all of these things. You are unable to grasp what has been said about them. You are still unable to understand the context.

Of course we are talking about those things, but you somehow keep talking about NZ incident after one attack as it was widespread problem

&gt;I have always been talking within the context of the original comment: terror and how its motivations are spread versus physical prevention of it after the motivation is established. Everything I said has been in that context.

Obviously you have failed to do so, since you feel the need to point that out for you, if you had quoted me in full earlier you would've had answered your own question

&gt;You are the one who is unable to read what I have said in that context and resorting to useless digressions. And no, you didn't ""cover it."" You insinuated that New Zealand was never brought into the discussion while it has been within focus from the very start.

5856,"In that case:

 Hadith and Sira
Abu Dawud (4462) - The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, ""Whoever you find doing the action of the people of Loot, execute the one who does it and the one to whom it is done.""  (This is a sahih hadith)

Abu Dawud (4448) - ""If a man who is not married is seized committing sodomy, he will be stoned to death."" (Note the implicit approval of sodomizing one's wife).

Sahih Bukhari (72:774) - ""The Prophet cursed effeminate men (those men who are in the similitude (assume the manners of women) and those women who assume the manners of men, and he said, 'Turn them out of your houses .' The Prophet turned out such-and-such man, and 'Umar turned out such-and-such woman.""

al-Tirmidhi, Sunan 1:152 - [Muhammad said] ""Whoever is found conducting himself in the manner of the people of Lot, kill the doer and the receiver.""

Reliance of the Traveller, p17.2 - ""May Allah curse him who does what Lot's people did."" This is also repeated in three other places.

There are several lesser hadith stating, ""if a man comes upon a man, then they are both adulterers,"" ""If a woman comes upon a woman, they are both Adulteresses,"" ""When a man mounts another man, the throne of God shakes,"" and ""Kill the one that is doing it and also kill the one that it is being done to.""

5857,"Ah I see, so you are ok with what the Scots are doing because they are doing it within their own legal system. To be honest, I agree with you on principle. The legal system is there to be followed. On the other hand though, the Spanish legal system does not allow for the Catalans to seek independence. (And to be honest, it's not followed by right-wing central governments either if it is to shit on Catalonia). Allow me for the sake of the argument to take this to the extreme. What if there was a society where a particular caste of people were slaves by law? Would you be ok with them following the law? Or in another example, if in a monarchy the ruler made it illegal to contest his rule, would you accept that there is no chance for democracy because the law forbids it? 
The point that I want to make is that from the Catalan perspective, the idea of democracy has failed because they do not get to decide what to do with their own country. Instead, Spaniards from all around Spain also get to have a say in that. And it doesn't seem to matter to them that Catala is threatened. As a matter of fact, PP and Ciuntantos voters seem to strive for it. So, for me, the Catalans are justified in wanting to leave the country for the same reason that they are justified to work outside the normal democratic process: because the normal path is filled with anti-Catalan elements.

Tech companies are by design global entities and need large markets to become successful in the current online market.

That‘s why the US and China can easily start massive online companies as they do not have a language/culture barriers and can easily reach huge amounts of users.

In Europe the online market is completely segregated in culture, language, as well as regulations.
This means European tech companies would never have the same reach unless they can adjust for the individual languages and regulations of all 28 countries.

A good example for this is Delivery Hero one of the largest German web companies and they are the current world leader in food delivery services.

5925,"&gt;No, you see, most people have some form of common decency and will not tell you that your country sucks. No, they also won't tell you how their country is much better

You are simply wrong when it comes to the United States. I'm willing to concede this is an exception though

&gt;But then again, I generally also don't approach people like an asshole, which might explain the different reactions we're seeing.

Americans never bring up politics with strangers in public.  I have never done so in Germany.  When they don't know I'm an American, they don't share their opinion on the US, but if they find out you're American, they will inevitably share their opinion.

&gt;I also live in germany for a long time now and I have not seen this ""pathological self-righteousness"" or the ""deep anti-american"".

Do you live in one of the major cities, where most people in Germany live? Can you admit you're playing just a *little* dumb here and you obviously know what I'm talking about, considering you *do* engage with the media, as you're on reddit.

&gt;Maybe you have a problem with people that don't 100% love everything America does and maybe the rest of the world (or in this case Europe) isn't just anti-American.

I don't 100% agree with everything America does, I am specifically talking about anti-Americanism, and I am by no means the first to have done so.  Here are examples in left-leaning newspapers:

Rather than being a sub-culture, Celtism is a whole culture in its own right, and as I said, it formed mainly out of a Roman refusal to invade Scotland and Ireland - where these cultures are most prominent. This is also why those countries are the main ones fighting for independence. 

I'm not saying that UK culture made it impossible to stay in the EU, but it did. By time we had an Empire, we'd bigged ourselves up and said we didn't need to rely on anyone. In times of trouble, right-wing populists whip up imperial sentiment and seek radical change to increase their own power.

My gripes with the EU are left-wing, not right. I see its institutions as fundamentally flawed because they seek to preserve economy over people.

&gt; “Absolutely nobody is talking about threatening our place in the single market,” he said. 

&gt; Owen Paterson, a Tory MP and a prominent campaigner for Vote Leave made similar claims. 

“Only a madman would actually leave the market,” Mr Paterson said. 


&gt; Following the referendum Oliver Norgrove, a former Vote Leave staffer, who supports staying in the single market, urged people to check the official campaign’s website and official literature – noting that the things they had campaigned for were “utterly achievable in the EEA and make no mention at all of leaving the single market”.
