Right next to the house where I was staying lived a black lady who had a sticker in the back of her car saying ""Edmonton is racist"" and complained how she was being discriminated against on a SYSTEMATIC level. Heard the same thing from my auntie who's of Central Asian descend - she says that because she's non-caucasian and has got a high-paying job, the white neighbours are envious, don't treat her well and barely talk to her apart from saying ""hello"".
On the other hand, the Caucasian people complain as well due to the positive discrimination quotas - my cousin, for instance, finished a pedagogy degree 4 years ago, met all the conditions but is still on the waiting list to get a permanent teaching job because non-white applicants are favoured to increase the diversity and thus they rank higher on the list.

If all of those people were being truthful in their statements, then I don't see any good reason why people in Eastern &amp; Central Europe would want this to change.

He really tried. His wife hated it here but he tried. He wanted to be a good king. He tried learning Dutch but wasn't easy, he once introduced himself as rabbit of the Netherlands. He also might have something to do with fences around the Amsterdam channels(?). In the end he was recalled to France, mostly because he was just a good king I guess. Napoleon was at war with England (What else is new) so he made trading with England illegal. We traded a lot with England so it wouldn't really work for us. So he didn't really enforce it. So you were selling English tea? you most have found it in the forest or found some older stock still left over from before the law. 

So he was recalled and we became part of France for the next few years. Then more taxes, we revolted. Learned from the power grabbing struggles, so we wanted William V back or more likely his son William VI, who always wanted to rule and was pissed at his dad for fucking up so bad.

170,"&gt;No international entity has requested Armenia to withdraw any forces from anywhere.

Armenian forces is also synonymous with the Republic of Armenia. There would be no ""Armenian forces,"" without the military aid of Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh. Either way, the implications of these resolutions really insinuates that both Armenian parties (Armenia, Artsakh) should withdraw from occupied territories to resolve this conflict. This is what the OSCE states (an organization you reference frequently), UN, EU, or any other reputable institution.

&gt;Please let's keep rhetorics away from this, there is already enough of it in other media, and stick to facts and let's be honest about it.

Which I said, the facts. Nagorno-Karabakh is considered to be apart of Azerbaijan's territorial integrity and its status ""disputed,"" despite still being apart of Azerbaijan. Do you deny this? The Republic of Armenia does not even recognize the legitimacy of the Republic of Artsakh, yet coincidentally they deceptively offer extreme support for this entity which is the only reason it survives. 

 &gt;The Armenian side as well has to abide by this, which would be 2, the return of the surrounding territories.

Armenia was obliged and called upon by the United Nations to return these occupied territories long, long ago and they have even to this day refused to do so. There is still no guarantee that the lands will be returned if a peace deal is established, actually the odds tilt toward Armenians remaining and not dispersing from the areas.

&gt;Just because you see that Azerbaijan loses and the Armenian side gains, in your eyes, doesn't mean that is the case. 

I have already discussed my opinions of this conflict before with you. You must admit that Armenia gains more from a conflict resolution than Azerbaijan. The mere fact that the Republic of Artsakh will gain a corridor to Yerevan is absurd (it will cut through Azerbaijan territory), when Naxchivan will continue to be isolated. 

&gt;The Armenian side loses defense capabilities

These were once established to be offensive capabilities against Azerbaijan, as the lands weren't supposed to be apart of Armenia before it was annexed. These ""defense"" capabilities are Azerbaijani territory that is occupied. In fact, Azerbaijan should be the side concerned about defense capabilities, because who knows when Armenia might decide to annex another piece of territory.

202,"Resolutions don't insinuate nor use synonyms willy nilly. A country invading another is clearly named, and ""shamed"". No such thing exists in the resolutions with respect to Armenia. 

No recognition that Armenia is occupying anywhere. 

No recognition that Nagorno Karabakh is occupied. 

No requests that any forces should be withdrawn from Nagorno Karabakh. 

No requests for Armenia to withdraw any forces from anywhere. 

The resolutions have to do with local Armenian forces form Nagorno Karabakh and the surrounding districts. They explicitly state all this in the resolutions, name the districts, towns etc, and refer to the local forces of Nagorno Karabakh. 

There is no debate here. And same applies to all those organizations you mentioned which basically back the OSCE. 

You took issue with the term attack because of territorial integrity (which makes little sense anyway) while ignoring the self determination of Nagorno Karabakh and the existence of it's own forces as such (which are recognized as such in the resolutions) and I said that is at best half the story and it is an attack regardless. It is not a walk in the park as you implied before. It is an attack against an unrecognized *state* but a recognized entity, local Armenians and their forces. There is nothing deceptive about Armenia supporting Nagorno Karabakh. They receiving support doesn't render them inexistent. 

&gt; Armenia was obliged and called upon by the United Nations

That's again not true. Cite here the resolution and the clause where this request is made from Armenia. 

The peace deal requires the return of the surrounding territories. It's part of the whole package. In fact this should be done prior to Nagorno Karabakh deciding whether it wants independence or not. In fact this is where the Armenian side sees no guarantees. What if after returning the surrounding districts Azerbaijan changes their mind and attacks Nagorno Karabakh? Do you see, this is not so black and white. 

Nakhichevan has nothing to do with this in that context. This is for the resolution of a specific conflict, not fixing all the other problems - what the Armenian side should request that Azerbaijan should recognize the Armenian Genocide as part of the peace process as well?

Seriously the surrounded territories were held for defense, check a map and you will see, for Nagorno Karabakh (so it cannot get surrounded) and for Armenia (attack from both sides, including from Nakhichevan on megrhi).

207,"When the dictatorship started the country's finances had not been going very well for a long time. The Estado Novo dictatorship lasted around 40 years, most of those in economic stagnation, with little to no development, especially when compared to our other European peers during the same time span. 

Salazar was kind of a money mastermind though, and he managed to balance our finances. With restructuring the economy and joining the European free trade union, in the last half of his government he actually had a surplus balance, which was invested in much needed public infrastructure, allowing some of this money to find its way to the poorest of the workforce. However most of the inner country, away from the larger cities, was living in poverty and severe social inequality the whole time. 

After the revolution things got worse from a global perspective: the country had gotten into a lot of debt to try and win the colonial wars. The revolution meant the end of the colonies, which meant that effort went to waste, and on top of that many portuguese families (over 1 million people) returned to Portugal, having lost everything and in extreme need. At this same time there was a push from socialist governments to institute several reforms, from financial support, public healthcare, to nationalizing large parts of the existing industries and allowing workers to take over many companies. It seems things in the rest of Europe were not so good in the 70s, with energy prices rising, and it all went to form a perfect storm, I guess. From then on, we have been struggling with the cyclical impact of the imbalance created by those 40y of stagnation and misalignment with the rest of Europe, but - my opinion - we are recovering our lost time and doing it on our very own way, without loosing the values that we choose to uphold when we choose a republic. 

Everyone feels it was a fair price to pay, except for oligarchs who were better before, people who had to flee because they were guilty of some ugly things, legal or just immoral, and the silly guys who, having nothing to say themselves, do not value living in a place with freedom of expression.

208,"&gt;Of course I explicitly mentioned Russia's role in the conflict from the point of view of loyalty as many Armenian see. How would Turks feel if the US sold the vast majority of weapons to their enemy which they use to kill Turks with, while being in NATO together? People don't like this.

Russia sells both arms to Turkey and Syria. Turkey is currently involved in fighting with Kurdish terror groups, Turkey does not dare to venture into Russian/Syrian controlled regions. Russia is the only reason that Syria's Assad regime is still in control of most centralized areas, such as the capital city of Damascus. Russia is capable of having loyalty and protecting their interests, another interest of Russia is Armenia.

American relations with Turkey is different, both are NATO members but the United States is supporting Kurdish separatists and terror groups which goes beyond what Russia does for Azerbaijan. United States has propped, armed and supported many of these groups (handing them the most advanced of weaponry, American intelligence, economic backing etc) which has angered Turkey. So this parallel is not comparable with Azerbaijan and Armenia.

&gt;produced by Russia nor by CSTO

If Turkey shoots a projectile, what do you think the Russian response will be? Try to think back and compare this analogy I am making with Syria.

&gt;Can you imagine a country shooting projectiles into say Turkey and NATO remains silent?

Yes, as thousands of innocent Turks have continuously been killed throughout the Syrian conflict. Many mortars and rocket shells have landed in Turkish border cities killing people and destroying their property and the responsible party is vast. Kurds, ISIS, and others.

This is one reason Turkey has launched their initiative into Syria, NATO or the United States were not helping, but the United States began arming some of these groups. Not to say that ISIS wasn't indirectly armed by the US in the first place.

&gt;Armenia is nit recognizes to be occupying anywhere but instead assists NKR.

That's up to the point of view, but logic and action proves that Armenia is directly assisting in the occupation of these surrounding districts.

&gt;No requests that any forces should be withdrawn from Nagorno Karabakh.

&gt;No requests for Armenia to withdraw any forces from where.

Mind you I am referring to the occupied territories which composes more land mass than Nagorno-Karabakh itself, it is recognized to be occupied. 

&gt;self determination of Nagorno Karabakh

Self-determination was not granted or guaranteed for Azerbaijani populations living in those areas. Almost a 1,000,000 internally displaced people, self-determination should not have a legitimate role in this conflict.

&gt;the existence of it's own forces as such

The Republic of Artsakh has no **real** force, no **real** military power, no **real** ecomomic power as well without the assistance of the Republic of Armenia.

&gt;There is nothing deceptive about Armenia supporting Nagorno Karabakh. They receiving support doesn't render them inexistent.

It is completely disingenuous, deceptive and manipulative. Armenia does not recognize their existence, though political, economic and military communication with the two go hand in hand with one another. 

&gt;It is an attack against an unrecognized state but a recognized entity.

An unrecognized state inside of Azerbaijan. 

&gt;That's again not true. Cite here the resolution and the clause where this request is made from Armenia.

I'm not a lawyer who keeps all the sources I stumbled upon for further credibility in future discussions, but a simple google search has resulted in the following: 

https://www.usip.org/publications/1998/12/nagorno-karabakh-searching-solution-0#keypoints

- Security Council Resolution No. 822, dated April 30, 1993: Urges the parties to resume
negotiations, cease the hostilities and calls for **Armenia to withdraw troops from areas of
Azerbaijan** their troops had recently occupied that same month

- Security Council Resolution No. 853, dated July 29, 1993: **Demands that Armenia cease
hostilities with Azerbaijan, calls for the withdrawal of Armenian troops from more occupied
areas of Azerbaijan, and reaffirms UN Resolution 822**

- Security Council Resolution No. 874, dated October 14, 1993: Calls to preserve ceasefire
between Armenia and Azerbaijan, calls for both sides to cease hostilities, for **Armenia to
withdraw troops from occupied areas of Azerbaijan**, and reaffirms UN Resolutions 822 and
853

- Security Council Resolution No. 884, dated November 12, 1993: Condemns the
violations of the ceasefire established between the parties, which resulted in a resumption of
hostilities; **calls upon the Government of Armenia to use its influence to achieve compliance
by the Armenians of the Nagorno-Karabakh region of the Azerbaijani Republic with
resolutions 822, 853 and 874**; demands from the parties concerned the immediate cessation
of armed hostilities; calls for the withdrawal of Armenia from Azerbaijani territories, and
reaffirms UN Resolutions 822, 853, 874

https://news.un.org/en/story/2008/03/252622-general-assembly-calls-removal-armenian-forces-nagorno-karabakh

https://www.un.org/press/en/2008/ga10693.doc.htm

Important to note, the recent OSCE peace resolutions have the same point included, the withdrawal of Armenian ""forces"" from Azerbaijani lands.

&gt;The peace deal requires the return of the surrounding territories. It's part of the whole package.

&gt;What if after returning the surrounding districts Azerbaijan changes their mind and attacks Nagorno Karabakh? Do you see, this is not so black and white.

No different to Azerbaijan's concern. Armenia has not showed willingness to discuss the surrender of the captured territories, it is just merely apart of the package and Armenia could potentially disobey parts of the deal. 

&gt;Nakhichevan has nothing to do with this in that context. This is for the resolution of a specific of conflict, not fixing all the other problems - what the Armenian side should request that Azerbaijan or Turkey should recognize the Armenian Genocide as part of the peace process as well?

Not a comparable analogy when you consider that Azerbaijan will be seceding territories to allow Armenia to have a gateway to the capital of Nagorno-Karabakh, a gateway created from parts of Azerbaijani territory. Naxchivan should certainly have a corridor to our own capital, if not a transit corridor under Azerbaijani and international observing control. The topic of the Armenian genocide is completely meaningless in this conflict and has no relevancy in discussions, considering Azerbaijan played no part... It doesn't make much sense to recognize it when Armenia controls a vast portion of your lands.

279,"The caliphate title had no practical benefit whatsoever and it really wasn't that much of a popular and valued title for classic Ottoman Emperors like Selim the Grim (the first ottoman caliph) or Suleyman the Magnificent. 

If memory serves right, Abdulhamid II and Mehmed VI were the only practical users of the title. The former caused massive religious yet at the same time political tensions in the public and was violently ousted; the latter simply was the last Ottoman Emperor(had no real power anyways). I don't know which one's rule is more of a catastrophe as an Islamic authority.  

Having the calpihate in the Ottoman Empire was close to useless. At least it kept us relevant in the war, and if the Brits weren't so competent in espionage; maybe we would have found a use for it. Nevertheless, caliphate has a lot to do with democracy simply because secularism is one of the foundations of Turkish democracy. Our many collapses into despotic rule have mostly been with religious rhetoric. Abdulhamid II used religious rhetoric when he implemented the ""İstibdat"" rule, the Ottoman puppet government under British rule constantly abused religion to oppose the National Movement, Adnan Menderes used it to gain popularity, Özal's corruption was masked by it, Erbakan tried to do his thing with his Imams, and the whole thing with Erdogan goes without saying. Even Kenan Evren used Islamic rhetoric and smashed secularism with his religious education bullshit and his leeway for Islamists. Considering the damages all these people did to our democracy simply by stepping on secularism shows how much secularism protects Turkish democracy.

I've had an interesting conversation about this identity thing with my cousin. She worked herself up due to the fact that in some schools crosses were removed. I didn't get why is it such a big deal then realized that being Christian is a very important part of her identity while I just don't give a shit, that's not what is defining me.

I can totally see it work with flags too and give the wrong impression.

I'm lucky in that regard with somewhat international family and international friends, so being Hungarian isn't even in the top 5 things that I consider my defining quality.

Are you assuming I'm a neckbeard, based on what?

&gt;i pointed out social similarities, not actions, you did, and now you are doubling down and nit picking my words because you have no other argument.

You actually pointed out actual policies, nothing to do with social similarities.

&gt;and i dont do reddit fights with online nobodies. so this a one off.

But you're rather hostile &amp; angry, very noticeably 

&gt;i love how you take these discussion with someone you dont know online so seriously. i have read both books, both books are filled with inconsistincies and holes and contradict one another. both are the literal word of God. nothing between them is different, the people are and how they choose to interpret it.

Oh, both are filled with contradictions and unexplained events

However Quran is read literally and contradictions are dealt, in manner that later writing over exceeds the earlier writing

There's nothing in the Bible regarding contradictions, or how you should read it literally 

And I'm very confident, in the fact that you've never read a single book.

&gt;they are both meant to be taken literally, thats me saying it as an atheist, the fact that this bothers you so much over an innocent comment must mean you are a christian, and you took offense. i didnt say anything about the books, you did, i didnt say anything about punishments, you did, i simply stated they are similar to varying degrees when it comes to social issues from womens rights to gay rights. traditionally, the conservative ones are similar.

I'm actually Jewish ethnically, but I don't follow any religion.

I would recommend you to read again what you wrote, you seem confused.

&gt;some more extreme than others, and both would like a society governed by conservative values, no sex before marriage and all that, something with which you must be familiar with. you cant deny that.

Some individuals? Most certainly. Universally? No, that's why we don't have that, that's why we haven't had gay stoning in any western law. 

&gt;you are sooo fucking confrontational, even if you werent then, you are now. and have made me the same, and im not gonna let you ruin my good mood, so this is my final reply and then im blocking you.

Well, if you feel it as such then there's nothing I can do regarding it, I don't think it should be problem to be able to prove your statement.

&gt;you call me ignorant and bigoted. step the fuck off dude, you arent worth my time, go bother your mother and dont get so upset over a comment online to prove how much you know to try and one up someone online, you failed.

You should probably give thought to retrospect

&gt;it would be even more pathetic if you were a 40 something old man. one that apparantly has a massive hateboner for muslims.

Well this is seemingly becoming more personal to you, and I hardly don't see how I would be either 40 year old or how I would have hateboner for Muslims if I ask you to explain policies in MENA region when you're equating all conservatives, like people that do not like abortions and people that execute people for being gay.

&gt;get a life, take a shower, get off reddit and get a girlfriend. thats me being a dick and confrontational. im sorry that the meaning of my very simple comment elludes you.

If you think about it, it makes sense that he was assassinated. Don't get me wrong I hate them for it, but I get why it happened.

Those same elites would revolt in 1843 and demand a constitution because king Otto had succeeded in keeping them out of power. The revolt happened mainly because the elites wanted to get in power and a constitution was the easier way to accomplish this. The first elections we had in the Kingdom of Greece, under a constitutional monarchy, were not that democratic. The people voted for the candidate of the family that they were already loyal to.

427,"&gt; First: thanks for having an honest debate. I seldom find these online anymore and I think it's a shame I don't. 

You're very welcome.  I've enjoyed this too.  Conversations like these help me explore my beliefs more deeply than I normally would.

&gt; Slavery was pretty bad, and a war was fought over it. So is slavery really the best example of how the US constitution protects a civil, peaceful debate over controversial issues? 

For a variety of historical reasons The Constitution didn't prevent that evil.  But it did prevent the compulsion of a majority opinion on the minority opinion.  My point was: had The Constitution established a unitary government slavery would have been forced on the whole body of the people.

Don't misunderstand me.  I'm not praising devolved government for *allowing slavery to continue existing*.  But I am proud of it for *containing* slavery.  And I'm proud of it for giving runaway slaves refuge in the free states of the north.

I address the cons of devolved governance in my next paragraph.  Devolved government *allowed* Jim Crow to exist.  That's a *horrible* thing.  A unitary state could have prevented that.  But it would have also enforced slavery nationwide at the country's founding.

Of course Jim Crow was stopped by our devolved federal government anyway.  So the benefits of a unitary state become less apparent when a devolved state can solve those problems as well (albeit perhaps more slowly).

&gt; Fact is: we've been in this situation for quite a while now. First, the combined political power of France and Germany hasn't been detrimental to the Netherlands when it came to making sure Greece abided by its austerity measures, for example*.

I would say the EU is more devolved than the US is.  Which has both benefits and drawbacks.  It's a fine line to walk I think.

&gt; But beyond that: I wouldn't mind a more federal European Union in which I would be able to vote for a Austrian party that had my best interests in mind, if we were to form a single Union. I'd feel bad for my German neighbours if their votes were converted to a single vote with the same weight as our Dutch vote did - that'd be antidemocratic.

I agree.  If Germany had the same voting power as the Netherlands it would be a bad system.  I'm repeating myself but in the US:

* Germany would be proportionally represented in the House.
* Germany would have equal representation in the Senate.
* Germany would have *near* proportional representation in the White House.

I *think* this is a good system.  Consider a devolved union of: Germany, France, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Belgium.  Assume this union follows the US's representation rules.  Now consider this proposal: ""Split BeNeLux between France and Germany"".  Germany and France are obviously in favor and BeNeLux is not.

Under the US system, the House easily passes the bill.  The White House eagerly awaits to sign it into law.  But the Senate rejects the bill.  A proportional system would have no problem passing this bill even if the bill would severely hurt BeNeLux for the benefit of the majorities in France and Germany.

In reality, Germany and France do not want to harm BeNeLux.  But history is long.  And having a system in place that protects minority states is a nice feature when politics get weird.  But it can not prevent evil totally.  It can only impede it (aside: it can also impede good).  If Germany and France convince Belgium to agree to the proposal, the US system would not protect the Netherlands (ignoring the Judiciary).  Its at that point when revolution would be the only option.

&gt;  the SGP wouldn't have any national say, even though it's votes account for 2/150 (number of seats in Parliament) of the Dutch population.

I would say this is the most significant problem of devolved government.  The US had this problem in the past with Mormonism.  The Mormons were a persecuted minority without a large enough presence in any state to gain political power.  The Mormons solved this problem by moving west and creating their own state (Utah).  I don't know how repeatable that strategy is.  Perhaps a system of secession in the same way that West Virginia seceded from Virginia.  But there are so many political obstacles its hard to imagine.

Assuming a state in the union adopted ""mixed member proportional representation"", the SGP could move to the same state and achieve the same result.  Remember, the House is proportional so they would have representation as long as they are within the same state boundaries.

Still.  A tough problem to be sure.

541,"&gt; But that's the point - demos means people, kratein means to govern. It's the people governing themself. The checks and balances shouldn't flow from the system to give the people a voice - they should flow from politicians being bound by the people's voice. 

Before we go any further I want to make two points clear.  First, if you have philosophical issues with devolved governance I understand.  This conversation is not designed to convince you otherwise.  Second, people in the US like their devolved governance even if they dislike aspects of it.  No system is a panacea and some amount of friction is to be expected in any system.  What I want to convey to you is *why things are they way they are and why people put up with it*.  It's not complacency.  Its the balance of pros and cons.

&gt; For one, a more direct form of voting can lead to a multiparty system, rather than the current system in which either democrats or republicans have a feasible chance of winning.

How a state decides to allocate its electors is entirely up to the state. They can use ranked choice voting if they'd like.

You are absolutely right that the Republican Democrat duopoly is anti-democratic but the electoral college is unrelated to this problem.  Electing the President by popular vote will not help or hurt the duopoly.

&gt; so long as people vote and their vote eventually leads to representation, minorities will be protected.

Devolved governance allows more minority ideas to be represented.

Imagine if the rights of slave holders in the South superseded the abolitionists of the North.  People in Massachusetts may have been forced to watch slaves imported into their states even though a majority of people in Massachusetts abhorred slavery.

This cuts both ways.  The Jim Crow South could have never spread North in a devolved state but a unitary state would never have had Jim Crow in the first place.  This is of course a terrible consequence of devolved power but the US is a wonderful place in that people can vote with their feet.  Millions of blacks left the south giving huge amounts of political power to the northern states.

Take a look at this graph.  Can you guess where Jim Crow starts?  (Hint: around the turn of the century).  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Migration_(African_American)#/media/File:Percentage_of_African_American_population_living_in_the_American_South.png

&gt; Though, given the fact California is by far the most populous state, wouldn't it make much more sense for it to have more influence on how it's governed?

In a devolved system, more populous states should strive for more autonomy and more local control (just as you described above).  The same is true for less populous states.  This is a funny coincidence.  People in both large and small states have the same political incentives.  To let people be governed as they wish.

In short, California has dictatorial power over California.

But there are issues of national importance which must be addressed from time to time.  How can we ensure those issues are addressed without destroying our lovely devolved system that the people like so much?  The US Constitution is a good attempt at that exact problem.  It leads to things like the House, the Senate, and the Electoral College.  A way of checking popular will at the national level while *fully enabling* it at the local level.

[...]

You live in the Netherlands.  No doubt you like your government more than the government of say Turkey.  But let's assume that Turkey and the Netherlands form a union.  Should the people of Turkey tell the people of the Netherlands how to live?  What about the opposite?  In a unitary state, one party is going to be unhappy in this union and the union will either dissolve or lead to revolution.

If the EU adopted the US constitution, you might not like that Austria has more representation than the Netherlands (edit: in one facet of government).  You might not like that Poland has less representation than the Netherlands.  But you would like the fact that Poland, Austria, and the Netherlands are free to organize themselves as their populations see fit.  And when it comes time to communicate national ideas, you'll like that there are checks on France's and Germany's power to compel the Netherlands to act against her wishes.

549,"While you have some good points, some of your statements deserve a rebuttal. 

* Indeed, solar or wind can't be used as a base generation, but that is not needed at the moment in NL. You are nowhere near the point where wind is a balancing problem. Netherlands has a lot of readily available gas to balance the lack or surplus of wind (also a lot of money for new technologies - e.g batteries, demand response, V2X, smart metering etc.). Also, there is A LOT of room available for wind turbines (onshore and offshore).

* [we are actually a developed country]. While that is the case (not in renewable energy though), you are vastly outperformed (no quotes needed) by some of the poorer member states in the EU. **E.g.** Romania (I am 100% sure that nobody there is using their car battery to power their house) - with all the crazy past, wild economy, lack of money and terrible politicians - always had a significant share of renewable.  Between 2008 and 2012 they completed (among others) one of the largest [wind farms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%A2nt%C3%A2nele-Cogealac_Wind_Farm) in Europe. 
In NL there is no problem pouring new asphalt, polishing the existing highways or even replacing the electrical grid. But money for renewable... nah...

* To add to the bullet above: you are outperformed by every member state in the EU. [ENTSO-E factsheet 2016](https://docstore.entsoe.eu/Documents/Publications/Statistics/Factsheet/entsoe_sfs_2016_web.pdf): Netherlands is the second from the bottom in EU in the share of renewable energy (and playing your game, we can exclude Cyprus since they just replaced their  presidential generator - joke aside, their are working really hard these years to improve the situation) [-&gt;relevant extract](https://i.imgur.com/cv1VG1h.jpg)

* The **whatabout** statement on Germany makes no sense and its just malicious. While I agree that Germany is on a weird path at the moment with the nuclear and the coal, their renewable share is extremely large and they are doing their best to improve it.

* You are proceeding with the [PALLAS](http://www.pallasreactor.com/?lang=en) project in Petten. What is stopping you to build a proper nuclear power plant?

603,"&gt; This is dead wrong.

It's a fact. The UK has 1/28th of the vote in the European Council. So does Malta. Malta also has veto power. Even if member states representing 99.91% of the EU population support a trade agreement, Malta can veto it. That is the equivalent of Cincinnati having veto power over US trade agreements.

&gt;The UK opted out of the Euro currency, they had a veto right within the EU parliament and they opted out of the Schengen-zone. The UK had many rights whilst in the EU

UK did not have a veto in the EU parliament. You don't know basic facts about the EU, so why are you commenting with such a strong opinion? It would take you 30 minutes to read [the wikipedia page on the EU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union), I suggest you do so. The UK has no power whatsoever to stop any other member state flooding us with millions of the most illiberal peoples in the world. [The Defense Minister of Greece literally threatened to do so a year before Brexit](http://uk.businessinsider.com/panos-kammenos-threatens-to-flood-europe-with-migrants-2015-3), even saying ""there will be some jihadis of the Islamic State too"". How could we stay in a union where a member state threatens to open its borders to terrorists in revenge for their economic crisis, and the EU by design has made it utterly impossible to do anything about? There is no way to kick Greece out. They have freedom of movement no matter what. Even if they start a second holocaust, they cannot be removed from the EU. The most that can be done is to revoke their voting rights, but this can be vetoed by any other member state, and countries like Hungary and Poland are sure to veto it since they might be next. The US can do whatever it likes, it is sovereign. If they want to kick a state out they can simply pass a constitutional amendment to do so, requiring only 60% in congress support it and 3/4 of the states. The EU on the other hand requires every other member state to leave the EU and reform it if they want to remove a member state. It's completely dysfunctional by design, because it was assumed that all member states would be rational and have similar political views. But far left and far right are increasingly coming to power. Regardless of your views, you shouldn't want to be in such a union with both far left and far right countries.

&gt;They need to accept that they are not the empire with its many colonies that they used to be.

No Brexiters care about that, this is a pure straw man. Many of the anti-imperialists on the left were against the EU and opposed us joining it. It was the right wing that was more supportive of the EU decades ago. We don't want to be an empire, we want basic democratic rights. We dont want Germany or Sweden to be able to fill us with people that want to kill Jews and gays and cartoonists. It was estimated that 20% of refugees in Germany would eventually move to the UK. Almost all refugees in Europe support genocidally anti-semitic terrorist groups. 64% of Egyptians think people who leave the Islamic faith should be put to death, and there are similar figures in the rest of the middle east. British people want a liberal secular nation, and that means being able to control immigration and keep out people like that, which Germany is not interested in doing. Given how big a problem the UK has with anti-semitism right now, where an anti-semitic party is tied in first place in the polls, we can't risk remaining.",,/r/europe/comments/8fe68e/facepalm/dy4foj5/,pacifismisevil,1524936895
604,"Article 37 of the German Constitution

&gt;(1) If a Land fails to comply with its obligations under this
Basic Law or other federal laws, the Federal Government,
with the consent of the Bundesrat, may take the necessary
steps to compel the Land to comply with its duties.

&gt;(2) For the purpose of implementing such coercive measures,
the Federal Government or its representative shall have the
right to issue instructions to all Länder and their authorities.

For reference here is article 155 of the  Spanish constitution

&gt;1. If an Autonomous Community does not fulfil the obligations imposed upon it by the Constitution or other laws, or acts in a way
seriously prejudicing the general interests of Spain, the Government, after lodging a complaint with the President of the Autonomous Community and failing to receive satisfaction therefore, may, following approval granted by an absolute majority of the Senate, take the measures necessary in order to compel the latter forcibly to meet said obligations, or in order to protect the above-mentioned general interests.

&gt;2. With a view to implementing the measures provided in the 
foregoing clause, the Government may issue instructions to all the authorities of the Autonomous Communities. 

There are only 2 minor differences:

* The Spanish constitution also applies if the community were to be ""seriously harming the general interests of Spain"". In Germany it can only be done if a Land is not obeying the German Constitution or other laws

* The Spanish constitution requires the Spanish government to do a formal complaint first. The German Constitution doesn't require said complaint.

This complaint clause actually came in handy once! Article 155 was proposed for the Canary Islands in 1989. However after the formal complaint was made by PM González, the regional Canarian government surrendered and followed the law again.

628,"&gt;It's not like the parties in question have only a few points in mind and will be done once these goals are accomplished, they're merely using a few points to push extremist ideology much much further.

But the reason why these parties exist is because concerns of a lot of people regarding refugees, terrorism and immigration are being ignored. The right wing and far right parties experienced a renaissance in 2015 because of the migrant crisis and the fact that only one response was presented to it in the media and people that said not only of them were Syrian were attacked and vilified.

&gt;Again, if your raison d'être is that ""the people"" are not listened to ""by those up there"" and you deduct from that that you are the chosen one to represent the obviously homogeneous will of the people then that's inherently an undemocratic approach because it claims authority over things that they don't have.

Of course they don't represent all the people but you have to admit at this point its a significant portion of the electorate. I mean around a third of the French voters voted for Marine le Pen and it's not because third of the French are secretly fascist and were waiting until just now to show it. 

&gt;Those parties, if they're minorities, don't speak ""for the people"" - and once they're majorities they start ensuring that minorities can't speak up against them.

And there are laws that protect minorities. And even if those fail there are protests and civil disobedience and other ways to show you're against. I mean even in supposedly authoritarian Poland there have been multiple major protests against bans on abortion and they've generally worked.

740,"&gt; considering that the radiations will be dangerous for thousands of years

Why thousands of years? Its [Cs-137](https://i.imgur.com/sdft32m.png) ([source](https://youtu.be/pOvHxX5wMa8?t=17m4s)) and Sr-90, both with half-lives of 30 years (I-131 was gone after 90 days, HF 8 days). After about 300 years they will be completely decayed. But they will be diluted sooner. They do damage only if ingested (not because of external radiation) and that can be easily avoidable.

These poisons however do not decay http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-34319540 but they too will be diluted in time:

&gt;After the war nine villages in the zone were sealed off completely - rendered death traps by unexploded ordnance, and **poisoned beyond habitation by the arsenic, chlorine and phosgene** the opposing armies aimed at each other.

These poisonous substances are not so easily detected as substances containing radioactive elements, where we can detect a single atom decaying by cheap [geiger counter](https://youtu.be/dTJlkEE3edo) and thus avoid consuming it or keep it bellow established limits.

And remember longer the half-life, lower the radioactivity. The assertion ""thousands of years"" it's often reference to plutonium's Pu-239 half-life of 20k years. But it's not radioactivity that it's a problem it's its toxicity like with many heavy metals (silver, lead, copper, zinc etc.) and ofc other substances:

&gt;Despite being toxic both chemically and because of its ionising radiation, plutonium is far from being ""the most toxic substance on Earth"" or so hazardous that ""a speck can kill"". On both counts there are substances in daily use that, per unit of mass, have equal or greater chemical toxicity (arsenic, cyanide, caffeine) and radiotoxicity (smoke detectors). [source: world-nuclear](http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/fuel-recycling/plutonium.aspx#ECSArticleLink4)

Physicist Bernard Cohen on plutonium:

&gt;When Ralph Nader described plutonium as ""the most toxic substance known to mankind"", Cohen, then a tenured professor, offered to consume on camera as much plutonium oxide as Nader could consume of caffeine,[21] the stimulant found in coffee and other beverages, which in its pure form has an oral (LD50) of 192 milligrams per kilogram in rats.[22] Nader did not accept the challenge.[23] [source wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Cohen_(physicist\))

And we store more toxic substances with no problem https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/apr/29/stocamine-toxic-waste-repository-france .

800,"&gt; These institutions were specifically designed to ""let cooler heads prevail"", among other things. Like: to ensure a balance power, encourage consensus seeking and protect minorities (most importantly the individual). All things that rule by referendum is very bad at.

I don't think any of them are good at it. 

While I am very much against democracy - I cannot say it's worse at deciding some outcomes I've been seeing consensus on from the political Center. There's failure modes that might be worse than random choice selection! As in consistently making the wrong ones.

After long consideration everybody decides to play footsie with a nuclear power or invade Middle Eastern countries because apparently Bad Things are Happening There. Clearly former adversial states like Russia think they can borrow bits off Europe if they feel like it, and they're **right**.

Then there is the migrant issue or to be impolite - lots of black people are coming into Europe and it's all very unclear whether any formal limits are to be applied to the situation. Something something greenhouse gas and racism. Jesus Christ.

These are all problems with the status quo of letting typical middle class types make decisions. They are wholly unsuited to executive decision making.

&gt; To argue that people just needed to be more X (smarter, nicer, ...) isn't helpful because you can change human nature only that much. Case in point, I don't think there has ever been a time when people were better educated than today. You just can't force them to make use of it, so they may believe the earth is flat anyway.

I agree - and the whole topic is an exercise in frustration.

Politics is in general so woolly it shaves 50 IQ points off an otherwise intelligent person. People can articulate precisely total meaningless bullshit and have it pass approved as reason. 

In fact unless there exists a mechanism to harness intelligent choices, it's completely possible to run a country into the ground with the best and brightest. I think we are in no way equipped to think or talk about this - we would need to go back to first principals and really tackle deep questions the way the Greek philosophers did.

I see lots of smart people around me today - in politics, in economics, in society - but they don't lack for brains, often they lack for courage to take a risk.

This is something I appreciated seeing after the Brexit vote - the British were walking about - looking proud and standing straight for the first time I'd ever seen that. Wrong decision, right decision - I'm describing how they must have felt.

876,"The 26th of march, the Netherlands has presented her 15 year expenditure plan for defense. The document enstablishes the precise will to increase the capacity of her three armed forces with the procurement of new materials and weapon systems and with the modernisation of the most recent acquisitions. According to what planned by the white book, the defense budget will see a general increase that will start in 2019, with an increase of 1,2 billion euros (from the 8,82 previously allocated to 10,06, equal to 1,29% of GDP), followed by 1,4 billion in 2020 and, starting by 2021, the objective is to increase the funds [allocated for defense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otna9Pe3jWg) by 1,5 billion euros every year.

For the Navy, the 15 year plan forsees the allocation of 5 billion destinated to the replacement of the fleet of 4 WALRUS class submarines (2,5 billion euros), probabilly with vessels developed by the A26 swedish project, and of the current multirole AAW DE ZEVEN PROVINCIEN frigates (2,5 billion), for which, from the end of 2018, is forseen a half-life modernisation for which 100-250 million have been allocated. The contracts for the construction of the new submarines should be signed in 2021, with the launch of the first vessel in 2027, while for the first frigate they are still waiting for the definiton of the requirements, but a delivery in 2029 has been hypothesised.

For the Army, the majority of the funds is destineted to the AMV – expected for 2021 – and to the following replacement – starting from 2033 – of the 382 FENNEK multirole armored vehicles, with a variable funding that goes from 1 to 2,5 billion euros. Furthermore, more than 1 billion is allocated for the AMV of the 148 infantry fighting vehicles CV9035NL, expected for 2022, for the acquisition of new middle and long range anti-tank capacities by 2025 and for the acquisition of new self propelled howitzers in order to replace the 56 PZH-2000, expected for 2031. 

For what concerns the Air Force, in the document the Netherlands confirms the acquisition of 37 F-35°. With the first aircrafts that will come into effective service at the start of 2019. 2,6 billion euros have been allocated for their procurament, to which 200 million must be added for “the integration of air-ground strategic and tactical weapons”, wich probably refers to the integration for the dutch LIGHTING II of the capacity to carry and deliver B-61-12 nuclear weapons, a capacity already possessed – in cases of particular necessities – by the current F-16. A major part of the allocated funds – a variable between 250 million and 1 billion – is dedicated to the acquisition of 14 CH-47F CHINHOOK medium-heavy transport helicopters, that will replace the current 11 CH-47D starting from 2020, while the CH-47F currently in service will be modernised.

881,"Democracy is flawed, but that doesn't imply opting out of the European Union is a bad idea. 

Is it like opting out of the US Confederation or Soviet Russia? We can't be sure.

The people whining here about education do not know the answer - I am confident of that. I doubt these pro-education advocates know what they're talking about - the assumption is that it would align a blue collar worker with liberal values - I'm personal evidence that doesn't happen. The alignment between blue collar and blue blood isn't along economic lines - there's other things - like a shared mythos or ideals.

I'm relatively sure 60%-80% that the political consequences of ignoring the Referendum result will make quibbling over Northern Ireland's border and Scotland's exit look like easy mode.

There will be only one group of people to blame if anything goes pear shaped in the future - the middle class. Everything that goes wrong with race relations and working class wage competition is already (correctly) blamed on the middle class - if you add sovereignty issues on top then you should expect civil society to become less civil.

I think we're at a ""Inner Party"" and ""Outer Party"" moment for Britain - I'm completely unsurprised at the extreme caution being exercised at Downing Street and I don't think many /r/europe -ans realize the degree of resentment that has been saved up over the last few decades of wage stagnation.

I'm going to leave some pictures here, they are NI specific but the intent isn't to say ""The Irish are coming"" - it's to point out that in living memory we've had a mini civil war in neighbourhoods that look **a lot like yours** with racial/class/religious conflict.

EDIT:

**ELI5: What is going on in Armenia?**

Since independence, Armenia has been in the hands of oligarchs monopolising the Armenian economy with little to no ""trickling down"". They formed a political party which can best be described as a post-Soviet ""power party"". Since then Armenians have been emigrating or looking for work elsewhere. Little prospects for the youth for a decent future, specially given that the establishment hasn't done a lot to improve the root problems of the country. Many attempts were made by the people to voice their concerns via mass protests (only very recent history): 

- [The 2008 presidential election protests - where 10 people were killed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Armenian_presidential_election_protests)

- [The series of protests during 2013](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Armenian_protests)

- [The 2015 ""Electric Yerevan"" protests in response to a hike in electricity rates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_Yerevan)

- [The 2016 Sasna Tsrer Militia hostage crisis - where protestors sided with them against the establishment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Yerevan_hostage_crisis)

However the straw that broke the camel's back was when the president of the country exhausted his two terms (10 year total) and changed the constitution from a presidential one into a parliamentary one *with the promise that he would not present himself as a candidate for the PM post*, and when the moment of truth arrives, despite his promise, he is chosen as PM and he takes the post. He basically pull a Putin/Erdogan.

The opposition, led by [Nikol Pashinyan](http://www.dw.com/en/nikol-pashinian-the-man-behind-armenias-protest-movement/a-43569827), by then had carried out a walk protest and gathered some momentum which grew to be too big to be dismissed and which forced the ""new"" PM to resign. The movement kept on with the pressure and managed to get him resign as the head of his party as well. The protests have been completely peaceful and their motto is to keep it peaceful by all means (hence why they use the term '[velvet revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velvet_Revolution)').

Now the deadlock is that Nikol Pashinyan insists that since the ruling party cannot be entrusted with carrying out free and fair elections ([OSCE/ODIHR Report on the 2017 elections](https://www.osce.org/odihr/elections/armenia/328556)) despite them being majority in the parliament, he has to be chosen as interim PM to overlook the process to make sure elections are free and fair. The ruling party argues that would be against the legal framework and that the democratic process should be lawful. 

Nikol Pashinyan has been attempting to get all other political forces to side with him, with only a few MPs short of obtaining the majority, but they have to necessarily come from the ranks of the ruling party. The president of the country (symbolic role) has announced elections for 1st of May. Nikol pashinyan has said that if he doesn't get majority the protest movement will boycott the elections and even attempt to surround and block the parliament. And this is where we stand right now, to pressure the establishment to give way. All the other parties with parliamentary representation have joined the movement and back Nikol Pashinyan.

At all times the protest movement has insisted that this is [not a colour revolution](https://www.civilnet.am/news/2018/04/27/Russian-Restraint-in-Armenia/335198), the only ideology is that of getting rid of the oligarchy and corruption, the protestors are people of all walks of life, ages, professions and includes people who have voted for parties other than Nikol Pashinyan's party. Even though has been pro-EU in the past, he has said that he wants to work with Russia but that Russia shouldn't interfere with Armenia's internal affairs.

993,"Well that depends on what you mean by ""mud hut"", really. Through much of history people lived in houses that were often made from wattle-and-daub. Basically a weave of whitties made wind- and waterproof by being smeared with mud that then dries out. That might sound primitive but it is actually a very effective building technique. These wouldn't be mud huts but real houses like [this](https://c7.alamy.com/comp/E5WFEH/reconstructed-farm-with-nine-houses-of-a-large-scale-farmer-from-the-E5WFEH.jpg). (I chose a Danish example on purpose, this is the reconstructed Viking farm at Fyrkat). [This](https://c7.alamy.com/comp/EBY0TM/wall-construction-made-of-woven-hazel-rods-lined-with-clay-detail-EBY0TM.jpg) is the hazel rod construction of a similar house in Hedeby that you would see if you took the clay and plaster off.

This construction techniqe was used until modern times, too. Oftentimes when you see a half-timbered house the space between the timbers was filled with a [wattle-and-daub wall](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/Lehm_ausfachung.jpg/1024px-Lehm_ausfachung.jpg). So technically something like [this](https://community.fachwerk.de/upload/opti/I186_2004929112518.jpg) could also be called a ""mud hut"". As you can see many of these buildings are still standing and being actively used.

This is the continental European tradition that this guy was referring to. However, there is also a Near/Middle Eastern tradition that shows how hypocritical he is being. As you can imagine most of the architecture of the ""cradle of civilisation"" (Mesopotamia) was [made from mud bricks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture_of_Mesopotamia), i.e. sun-dried clay. And even most city-walls in archaic Greek cities were made from that material!

Of course if we want to be a bit hyperbolic bricks are nothing but clay (i.e. mud) baked in a kiln. So if you will [this is also a ""mud hut""](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Roskilde_Cathedral_aerial.jpg/1024px-Roskilde_Cathedral_aerial.jpg).

I'm being very reductive of course. There is a whole different construction technique called [rammed earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rammed_earth) that was also used until modern times to build houses from ""mud"". It was used by the Romans among others and is basically exactly what the name suggests: walls build from compacted clay. Believe it or not: [this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Piseehochhaus_Weilburg.JPG/800px-Piseehochhaus_Weilburg.JPG) is also made entirely from ""mud"".",Franconia (Germany),/r/europe/comments/8fck30/new_space_director_of_greece_worthless_europeans/dy3wcwr/,breaks_it,1524908117
994,"When the UK will cease to be a member of the common trade area as it is its wish, WTO trading rules (which apply worldwide) and their *most favoured nation* clauses will apply.

No, honestly, I feel for you. I had a relationship with someone from far far away which mostly took place online, and I was very much in love, like never before, I really thought this was it. We did meet several times though. It hit me like a train when he broke up over the phone, and only months later I realised that all the feelings I had for him were obviously not based in reality, because in fact, I knew so very little about him. We were in touch via WhatsApp all the time, and I felt like he cared, but looking back, our relationship was not as deep as I imagined it was. I only truly realised after the fact that he really didn't want to ever leave his country, that he really put his boss and his dad above everyone else in his life and deep inside was just very traditional and illiberal.


I know it hurts like hell, and that girl was incredibly naive for going all the way to ""I love you"" without ever meeting you in person. But this is the tough part about online relationships. They can induce deep feelings between people that are not really based in reality. Don't blame yourself for falling in love, but blame yourself for believing that the sweet feeling of being in love tells you anything about your long-term compatibility with another person. At least that's how I try to look at it now.",,/r/europe/comments/8fbwty/shy_german_woman_meeting_extroverted_brasilians/dy3tlpk/,vlindervlieg,1524901084

1203,"&gt;Yeah, I know. Could you not presume I'm an idiot?

Hard to do when you are complaining about the very existence of billionaires. In Europe, their total wealth adds up only to several % of the economy. Completely dwarfed by public sector, for example. They are not hoarding significant amount of money at all. However, large private capital explores business avenues that other sectors of the economy cannot and do not. In this they are an important driver of economic progress. It is one thing to keep economic inequality reasonably low, but demanding to confiscate the wealth of billionaires is the economic equivalent of flat earthism.

&gt;But many investments just go into stores of value and other such vehicles whose purposes are effectively to hoard wealth.

Nope, what ""stores of value""? Billionaires invest their money. Again, nobody sits on the money. This applies to those who rent, too, they are no exception.

&gt;billionaires are fungible like anyone else and their successes are as circumstantial and contingent as any other endeavor.

Dubious at best. And even if true, this does not change the fact that large private capital plays an important role in the economy. To illustrate my point, if there were no self-made billionaires, it would almost make sense to give random person $ billions to spend as they wish.",Slovakia,/r/europe/comments/8f4eok/number_of_billionaires_in_2018_by_country_in/dy3qgr5/,Marha01,1524894761

I'm not ashamed to say I'm from the Balkans, though I'd never say I'm proud to be a citizen of any country (because that never made sense to me), instead, I'd say I'm proud that I have enough sense to see through all of this, that nationalism against people who are basically speaking the same language as us never made any sense, and that nationalism is the last thing that should be on your mind if you want to live the best life that you can.

I'll talk about ants specifically since I'm better informed on the subject but it's a general issue when it comes to insects.

If I want to find out what ants are endangered in Germany or specifically Bavaria I can check out the [red lists](https://www.lfu.bayern.de/natur/rote_liste_tiere/2016/index.htm), which are nice and updated for e.g. birds or mammals. If I want the latest report on ants I can find [this](https://www.lfu.bayern.de/natur/rote_liste_tiere/2003/doc/tiere/formicoidea.pdf) report from 2003 which quotes a book from 1998 written by one of 2-3 researchers who are known for publications in this field.

There I can learn that 53.2% of ant species are in various forms endangered, 17.1% are on pre-warning lists and for 27% we have no idea. This **twenty year old data tells me that 2.7% of ants in Bavaria are *not* endangered** and it's the best we got.

Bonus, we know [since almost twenty years](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC122904/) that two (yes, two) colonies of invasive ants have conquered Europe from Portugal to Italy (and nowadays Germany), pushed out native species and had massive influence on local ecosystems.

Even if people *would* care we would have no idea how bad the damage is and/or what we could actually do about it. There's plain and simply neither enough public interest nor enough funds, nor enough researchers.

Sophistry is the construction of arguments are logically specious but *sound* convincing, like anthropomorphizing bureaucratic bodies and then attributing them character flaws like ""petty"" to dismiss their reasoning, rather than discussing the merit of their rationale for those decisions.

&gt;I'm telling you how you're perceived by others. I thought you people loved foreigners' opinions of your politics? Because you seem to share your opinions about our government with us pretty much all the time.

I'm American, so that's another swing and a miss. By the way, this argument is also sophistry. You're making an appeal to authority as an ""unbiased outsider"" when you are clearly anything but that. Later on you act as if you speak for all Americans, too, which is a total joke.

&gt;Oh, boo hoo, your enemies are out to get you. Yeah, that's called reality. That's what makes them your enemies. That's no excuse to behave the way they are towards Britain.

?

In the span of one paragraph, did you just argue that Britain being charged 6 pounds to travel to the EU is unfair and must be stopped, but the attempts of foreign nations to dissolve the European Union are just the facts of life and must be tolerated? 

That comes across as very desperate. Are you an English pensioner or something?

1318,"&gt; The mon was technically a symbol rather than a flag. It was used to signify certain families, clans, businesses, etc. They're the Japanese equivalent to European coat of arms. They likely weren't used by the whole country like they are with today's flags but are similar to flags in that they represent the nation. Since a certain clan would be ruling the nation, that flag would be used.

Interesting. I'm honestly quite uneducated when it comes to cote of arms. Strangely enough, even though I've seen and heard them mentioned in movies, the first time I looked them up was yesterday. Probably more a reason to why I'm here than to it being some strange coincidence though. Over here in Sweden, people have generally rallied around a king, or aspiring king, and not around families.  I am 100% certain it has never been mention in school, among friends or in the workplace. Which now seems kind of weird.

Anyways, why I mention that is because the idea of mons sounds quite interesting, and I want to believe that the strong family bond Japan is often perceived to have is because of that, but considering it seemed to have worked the same way in some European countries, I guess it can't be attributed solely to it.

the object of the post is the visa free regime which the UK will lose and this will affect mostly tourists. 

&gt; Italy has 12% unemployment and like 140% debt to GDP ratio...
&gt; 
&gt; Spain has like 18% unemployment and 100% debt to gdp ratio.
&gt; 
&gt; Greece had what? 8% unemployment and 100% debt to gdp ratio which caused their entire economy to collapse? 

Italy's public debt ballooned during the late 70s and the 80s, long before we had the Euro, and our unemployment rate was also very high. It's almost as if Italy's economic problems are caused by domestic issues...
&gt; 
&gt; But yeah, you enjoy. I'm sure having a collapsing economy while being bound to a currency you can't devalue will be great fun.

Oh yeah, my grandfather had a lot of fun when he had to stock his warehouse for months because the price of the components of his business fluctuated so much he couldn't reliably assess how much he would pay in devalued Italian lire, back in the days when we had double digits inflation rates and a candy cost 2000 Lira. 

Great benefit for the average Italian fixed salary worker to have a highly devalued currency, in a country that has no raw material nor is energy self reliant, but has to buy most of it on the international market with prices in hard currencies like the American dollar.

In a relative context compared to crazy places, sure. But it's still high and rising.

&gt; Also, GDP is measured yearly, while the wealth of a billionaire is created over many years

Yeah, I know. Could you not presume I'm an idiot?

&gt; basically all wealthy people invest the money, nobody just sits on it.

I'm not suggesting that they liquidate everything and then just sit on piles of gold like dragons, though right now they are hoarding enormous amounts of cash. But many investments just go into stores of value and other such vehicles whose purposes are effectively to hoard wealth. They aren't converting money into productive capital. This is not surprising, the majority of wealth owned by billionaires as a whole comes from rent to begin with.

This isn't entirely an important point though since billionaires are not economic drivers.

&gt; A decision of one person can indeed ultimately have more impact on the world than a work of 15 million people. And results is what should count, not the effort.

There is a weight that comes from commanding wealth, but this is ultimately a circular argument since impact is obviously not tied with wealth and wealth is not tied with impact. Besides which, the fundamental reality is that their decisions don't mean crap without the background of effort - modes of production are social processes - and that billionaires are fungible like anyone else and their successes are as circumstantial and contingent as any other endeavor.

Of course I know that they don't hold any ""real"" power and as constitutional monarchs only have a symbolic character, but for me it doesn't really change the fact, that they represent an outdated government form and set of ideals. Afterall it's a hereditary position, no matter the actual qualifications of the person or their character. For me, this system of constitutional monarchs stands in direct opposition of ideals such as equality. There's also a media circus around what should be in my opinion just another family. An adult member of the royal families might have the option to withdraw into privicy, but the children, who often times aren't spared from the media attention, might not. Now, if the Dutch or Danish or British like their royal family and want to keep the monarchy - which polls suggest is the case (at least for the British, from what I have read) - it is their choice. And I see that having a historic lastname like Windsor or connections to a historic house such as Oranje might increase the identification of the people to their head of state, but for me having a monarchy just isn't appropiate for modern times. I'd really like to hear the opinions of someone who is from a county that still has a monarchy. Is the royal family a subjet of interest in day to day life?

Solar and wind cannot be used for baseload, and also take up vast amounts of space for very little energy compared to hydro or fossil fuel-based plants. We have no room. 

On top of that, we are actually a developed country, meaning that power usage is high. That means we're going to be vastly ""outperformed"" by third world countries where they replace the presidential generator with a solar panel and a car battery, and everyone else is sitting around fires. (I guess wood *is* renewable though.) 

We actually have very strict environmental standards, to the point where shutting down the coal plants and making up the shortfall with imports like mr. Klaver would have us do, would *raise* pollution. German coal plants are way dirtier than ours.

After the video was released Dudaković gave a statement saying:

&gt; The Army of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina was never ordered to commit crimes. If such things happened, then there should be an investigation and the perpetrators punished. ... The film shows the front line. I was normally engaged on the front line directing the artillery. I am an artillery man. The film with its subtitles are the usual product of Serb propaganda which we came across throughout the war and later too. This is why I do not get excited.

Russia can start about Tatar decolonisation for sure, if one day Tatars come and take over Russian heartland, genocide the Russians and put in settlers there, and of course rule Russia. Until than, no such a thing is present.

It's not about who were there before but who have came to Crimea in which way. Sure, some settlers who were being put into the place of exiled Crimeans aren't some ordinary people, and I can't say they should have a say in the region's future.

I have a cousin who's guite good at sprinting, if i dm'd you our surname you'd find online italian regional articles about him easily, and he told me that if he ever got to international competitions he would 100% represent Italy.

In my case, it's a bit more weird. Italy is a GIANT compared to Bosnia, at least for international rapresentations (be it for sports, music or art/culture/politics) so i'd kinda like to represent Bosnia because of that.

On the other hand, i don't have that much of a ""real"" connection with Bosnia, and i feel more Italian overall, plus, compared to my Italian language fluency my BCMS (short for Bosnian-Croatian-Montenegrin-Serbian, in alphabetical order) sucks major dick, so i'd feel more natural being seen as an ""Italian"".

Overall, as a first-immigrant generation kid, i'd still feel as an ""Italian with Bosnian parents"" in the Bosnia team, and as a ""Bosnian born in Italy"" in the Italian one :(

Sorry for the long rant but that's a quite good question so it got me going.

Some accusations. 

So, **Moller** was found guilty by Danish Committees on Scientific Dishonesty of intentional fraud. In 2005 Moller's bird banding permit is revoked, and a letter is sent to Moller's colleagues warning them not to help him in his research

Then you imply that there is some conspiracy by nuclear lobby and go on with some emotional response on rationalwiki and nuclear energy (which is not the topic here - maybe you can address some of that anti-nuke indoctrination [here](http://www.energytrendsinsider.com/2016/02/04/parsing-bill-nyes-anti-nuclear-energy-keynote-speech/)).

I posted those studies in hope you can provide some other studies.

**Mousseau** et al. findings are not in accord with other researchers in the field such as this study by [Robert J Baker et al.]( https://academic.oup.com/jmammal/article/77/1/155/883306).

&gt; The small-mammal fauna is abundant in both number of individuals and number of species even in the most radioactive sites within the 10-km zone. The diversity of mammals within and outside the 10-km and 30-km exclusion zone appears comparable…Based on our observations, the magnitude of morphological and chromosomal aberrancy is not sufficient to readily identify the site as radioactively polluted without electronic sensing devices

Direct contradiction of the findings of Mousseau et al.

And then in regards to birds here [American Scientist - Growing Up with Chernobyl: Working in a radiaactive zone, two scientists learn tough lessons about politics, bias and the challenges of doing good science](http://www.jstor.org/stable/27858869) go to paragraph 6 in which a group is criticized for doing sloppy work on Barn Swallows within the Chernobyl zone. Mousseau’s group did work on Barn Swallows.

&gt;Some reports on the biological impacts of the fallout from Chernobyl seem to lie outside the bounds of reasonable expectations. One study reported that barn swallows, collected from northern Ukraine, were experiencing partial albinism and increased germline mutation rates, with a concomitant loss of evolutionary fitness. Unfortunately, the authors did not identify exactly where the birds were collected, they did not evaluate the radiation doses to the birds and they provided little information on the level of soil contamination [...]

&gt;The authors of the barn-swallow article inferred that the variation among the birds was the result of radiation-induced mutations, but they did not provide any evidence for their assertion.

Firebugs - Some Swiss artist named Cornelia Hesse-Honegger, an amateur scientist, has documented abnormalities in firebugs around nuclear power plants in drawings that she has made. Mousseau latches onto this findings by announcing he has observed the same thing, firebug abnormalities strongly correlated to background radiation fields. Mousseau accepts her stuff at face value. Mousseau’s never present this stuff to his peers, as someone would have questioned that surely this was nonsense.

And that famous [photo](https://i.imgur.com/RXERnba.jpg) of tree logs (scots pine) taken by Mousseau which displays [sapwood](https://i.imgur.com/DfgJMC7.png) in the spring when it's moving the most water and nutrients. Similar log from [Scotland](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/highlands_and_islands/7825954.stm) 
and logs in exclusion zone are normal [google image search](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&amp;q=chernobyl+logging). 
The image was nonetheless adopted for cover of the fearmongering book by  Yablokov [Chernobyl: Consequences of the Catastrophe for People and the Environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl:_Consequences_of_the_Catastrophe_for_People_and_the_Environment)

&gt;The book was not peer reviewed by the New York Academy of Sciences.[2][9] Five reviews were published in the academic press, with four of them considering the book severely flawed and contradictory, and one praising it while noting some shortcomings

Their estimate of deaths from Chernobyl: https://i.imgur.com/eqUbErN.jpg. Here is a [Critique of New York Academy of Sciences for Publishing Non-Scientific Book](https://www.scribd.com/document/63975511/Critique-of-New-York-Academy-of-Sciences-for-Publishing-Non-Science-about-Chernobyl). AFAIK the book is no longer issued by NYAS but it can be bough on one of the Janette Sherman websites for 1/10th of the initial price.

Mousseau and Moller were called out again in respect to fukushima birds [Response to authors' reply regarding “Abundance of birds in Fukushima as judged from Chernobyl” by Møller et al. (2012)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749112002527)


It seems there is a pattern. And by associating themselves with the likes of Helen Caldicott, Joseph Mangano, Alexy Yablokov, Janette Sherman and others all known to lie and being called out by experts in the field, it does not help them with credibility.

1982,"&gt; Hello Ryanair? When’s the next available flight to Amsterdam Schipol?

It doesn't really work how people think; people assume from that this cold approach culture exists but in reverse which for the most part doesn't. If anything it's basically chivalry; people say chilvalry is dead in NL but this is basically a form of benevolent sexism where males will hardly ever to a female make the first explicit overt move even if sexual tension has been dripping from the conversation because of some belief that females can't handle it so females end up being the ones doing it.

&gt; Really? That is so cute. So very tsundere like, the type incels would probably appreciate.

Probably not because it implies you have platonic friends who later become lovers to begin with and that you aren't so stuck up that you need to divide the world into one sex for friendships and the other for having sex with.

&gt; But yeah, it seems like this movement is largely US based and there’s not much of a thing for it on this side of the Atlantic

Probably because ""dates"" and those cold approaches are a really big thing in the US and how the culture works is that based on a first impression you have to decide whether someone is romantic material or not so if you only give off a slightly unsettling vibe for whatever reason you don't really stand a chance.

Everyone I've ever been intimate with pretty much said that they initially really did not like me; apparently I make the worst first impressions imaginable.","Maar oma, waarom heeft u zo'n grote negerlul?",/r/europe/comments/8f729h/dutch_newspaper_has_article_explaining_what/dy247ba/,my_farts_will_go_on,1524835831

2024,"No.

You are the one with the prejudice here for affirming, again and again, that I can't hate this Spain —as I do—, be an independentist —as I am—, and at the same time *want the best for this country* —which I also do. 

You think I'm rejoicing in this sentence. Fucking no.

It's ironic because I may be doing your country —not hard unionism: your country (important difference)— a better favor than you trying to defend it against the criticism of the people who hate the hateful things it has —because, yes, it has plenty of them.

I can, in fact, want BETTER things for the people in that than some of the people that are so blindly proud of it that they decide to ignore, for an example, the low quality of our separation of powers. Or is it because of catalans and basques, too, that Spain is [at the bottom of perceived judicial independence](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/resource.html?uri=comnat:COM_2017_0167_FIN.ENG.xhtml.COM_2017_0167_FIN_ENG_02053.jpg), in the EU?

See for an example Albert Pla's article, today, in eldiario. He has been criticised because his book is called *España de mierda*, while people don't realise that it's a fiction book criticising many of the pathological things that Spain has. Mind that Albert Pla isn't particularly stupid, he's one of the keenest and smartest artists the country has, yet somehow in this country artists aren't heard if they make a non-chauvinistic push, but criticised. If Spain proved itself to not be *mierda* (in this case, for artists, as that's the context of the book), Pla would be happier, and woulnd't feel compelled to write that kind of book. Beause it doesn't, artists do have to make those things —and may I remind you that some are in jail with harsher sentences than La Manada is getting for now, that won't get the dispersion treatment. 

Justice should proportional, and it isn't. Prosectuors should prosecute equally, and they aren't. Today, the German government rejected Zoido's intention of decorating the german police that detained Puigdemont. Can you see? Zoido thinks that's a normal thing to do because it's what they've been doing in Spain, but Germany, where a way better power separation exists, said ""are you serious? nope"" 

So, ironically:

- A Spanish nationalist may choose to side with ""The State"" on this because of his nationalism —like you do here, siding with the judges because you feel uncomfortable criticising your country, as if you had a complex with it—, which is someone effectively putting your national reasons over things like common decency and empathy. In other words: you put your country interest over the people in it one.

whereas

- Someone who hates Spain will take the chance to debilitate the gov so that it ups the chances that *a change to better will happen* that will make his country not as shit, so that Spain can get better, and more close to something to be loved by those who don't.

You think people hate your country because ""why not"". No. Countries —through their people and their representatives— do things, and they're loved or hated for what they do or think, and not in a mindless approach.

And millions of Spaniards hated Spain, yesterday, because of what Spain has shown to be in this case —as many other ones. And they also hated it because they had to see how many people were ok with that sentence —the other half of the country, which currently holds the government, and people like you, that will choose to side with justice even when justice is clearly failing, because of national reasons.


&gt;About your last paragraph, I admit that I don't understand very well what you were trying to say there. I would just point out that you were the first one to mention that one of the convicted was a policeman in another post, implying that he got preferential treatment.

Well, can you prove that didn't play a role?

Mind that I'm not affirming it did. I'm saying: it's part of the picture to take into account, moreso knowing how Spain's power separation isn't exactly the best.

You are, instead, affirming that IT DIDN'T. Your claim is higher than mine.

I mean you dont see such skyrocketing average heights in such an acclerated short amount of time without being one of the most heightist peoples &amp; countries to of ever of existed. I mean the huge increase in average height to becoming the tallest in the world, that isn't a fluke, or down to just better nutrition alone or down to a random chance. It's a very active and ongoing result of sexual selection aka heightism... That's what i think happened to the Dutch for them to go from shortest to tallest in the world in under 50 years. I have to ask though and im just wondering, but being that the Dutch are so tall, are the odd few short Dutch men looked down upon as lesser, discriminated and dinegrated in Dutch society?. Im 5'6 and as a short man how would i be treated and looked at in The Netherlands??.

I mean i feel like what with everybody being so tall, heightism might not be as discussed as explicitly than in other countries, it seems Dutch people don't talk about it as often etc but instead looking in from the outside it seems you are required to be of a certain much higher standard, and height is just included in that. To rephrase it, being ""tall"" might not be the most important part, being a good overall package is. And the height box to check is still stricter than in the USA or UK(both very heightist nations themselves), even though it's not as spoken about. Also height is like money. You don't realise how important it is until you don't have it. So as a Dutch person, and as a country your gonna be ignorant of heightism as you take your tall height for granted.

The west is relevant because we are talking about western countries and their justice systems. Obviously Norway is one of those countries.

&gt;It's not guilt by association. It's seeing that a person is saying 'gas the jews,' then trying to figure out if that person might actually hold far right beliefs.

Its quite clear he doesn't hold these views though. Just watch some of his videos or listen to him speak.

&gt;You notice that he's connected to far right figures (like tommy robinson)

Who has never advocated for killing Jews as far as I can see. Tommy certainly has a questionable past but I am not sure I would call him far right anymore. I could be wrong on this but he comes across pretty reasonable these days.

&gt;that he took part in stuff like gamergate and is connected to the whole skepto-sphere/nationalist-camp.

Didnt know he was a figure in gamergate. A point in his favor then.

&gt;Now he's not guilty of what these people do, but we can see patterns and judge whether or not he has intended to spread anti-semitic ideas (or if he contributes to it even without intent).

So we can see he clearly isnt anti semitic then? Tommy Robinson isnt anti semetic and nor is anyone else that Dankula associates with as far as im aware. I still dont think that this would be a fair way to judge anyone but by your own logic he isnt anti semitic.

&gt;Just saying something's a joke doesn't justify it as you can spread anti-semitic ideas disguised as humour or just spreading propaganda without explicitly stating you're a neo-nazi and this would still be wrong.

Yes but it was clearly a joke. He didnt need to say it was a joke for that to be clear. The tone of the video is always very light hearted, millions of people found it funny and his girlfriend attested thats his kind of humour.

2547,"Printing money is generally not a good option. It works in the short term, but very quickly it adjusts for inflation, leaving everyone with less money than before.

Traditionally it's a very easy solution that countries likes to use, but if you ever ""need"" to print money in any significant quantity to pay something, it generally means there's a problem with the budget and with the economy. Printing money doesn't actually solve these issues, and if it's since too much or causes inflation too.

It's a good thing the ECB won't print money for the whims of politicians. Sure, it closes down an easy way out, but it also forces countries to look for real solutions. Solutions to core problems. Greece actually has to fix is economy, it can't print money as infinitum. This is a good thing, because I wouldn't be surprised if Greece became another Zimbabwe.

Now I realise some economists would disagree with me, I'm sure there must be some valid reason to do this, but printing money is, to my understanding, a terrible idea. Government defect should not be paid by printing money. If it's done once, it will be done again. The situation doesn't change quickly, if the government needs more money it will need more money the next month and the month after that too.

2602,"If you measure relative social mobility (the ability to move from the lowest quintile to the highest quintile), the US is behind. If you look at absolute social mobility (i.e., how much more money the person earned) the US is still doing fine. 

I think that absolute mobility is more important to individuals, but both measures are useful.

You can see the difference by looking at the inequality numbers in the OP. 

The number for Denmark is 4. If the income for the bottom 20% is 20,000/year, that makes the average income for the top quintile to be 4 times that, or 80,000 year. So a generational increase of 60,000 is enough to move the Dane into the top quintile.

If the bottom number for the US is 20,000, the top number will be 8.3 times that number, or around 170,000.  Meaning to move into the top quintile requires 150,000.

But it's kind of a ridiculous argument to suggest to a particular individual who makes, say, 100,000 more than his parents that since he hasn't moved into the top quartile, he isn't socially mobile.

While the person from Denmark, who earned less, *is* socially mobile because he moved to the top quintile. 

That's a kind of rough explanation of what's being measured. However, the actual analysis requires not the *average* of each quintile (which is what the OP shows), but the *cutoff* to enter each quintile.

2609,"The generals were wrong. The major strategic resources were in the south - Ukrainian grain and Caucasian oil fields. 

Hitler was right when he said his generals didn't understand economic principles, their plan was based on what they learned in the French campaign - a swift push towards the capital to end the war as quickly as possible. It makes sense, that's what they emphasized in their officer schools and it's what they experienced in the war so far - big, manoeuvre warfare where whole armies are employed as flanking units - they've been thinking about war this way ever since the Schlieffen Plan. 

The problem is Germany only had *months* of oil reserves to work with, they needed a new source badly. Before Operation Barbarossa even started, there were calls to *demotorize* parts of the army.

 That's right, they barely had any motorized divisions to begin with, and they were thinking of downsizing! We like to imagine the German army based on 1944~ Western Front footage, Germans driving around everywhere in halftracks and the like - those were a tiny minority of the real army. It got bad enough that their recon units were re-issued *bicycles*. *Bicycles!*

But they were wrong. Germany needed oil and they needed to cut off USSR oil. WW2 is all about oil. The USSR can have all the divisions they want, no oil = no offensive capability = you lose. That's modern war. 

The problem is we like to think it was all about Moscow because.. the people telling us it was all about Moscow are German generals that wrote memoirs after the war. 

Halder, Manstein, Guderian all wrote about this and they all have an interest in looking like they were right and gosh-darn if Hitler just wasn't such a madman (I mean he was in other ways, but he was right here) we would've sure shown those commies! They were good generals, but that doesn't mean everything they say should be taken at face value.

Diocesan priests can have their own property.

Limits to the amount that may be sought for sacraments and sacramentals are set by the province (a province usually consists of 3–10 dioceses), but if a larger amount is offered, it may be accepted. The province may also determine how the standard offering must be divided.

In general, Mass stipends are always meant to go to the priest who says the Mass. Offerings for marriages and other sacraments may have to be divided between the priest and the musicians, the altar servers, the parish, or other parties.

2723,"You know, currently Ukrainian uses Cyrillic, but sometimes here is discussions about Latin alphabet. 

Ukrainian phoneme is very close to Slovak, but we do not have long vowels. So, we have, too:

&gt; /x/, /g/, /ɦ/  
&gt; /ɲ/, /ɟ/, /c/, /ʎ/  
&gt; /dz/, /dʒ/

But here is so much palatalization, example for most popular:

&gt; /zʲ/, /dʲ/, /dzʲ/, /tʲ/, /sʲ/, /tsʲ/, /lʲ/, /nʲ/ (/rʲ/)

And here most don’t like diacritics. 

I would like to change alphabet very strong where diacritics are few. For example:

&gt; c /ʃ/ → tc → č /tʃ/

&gt; [g](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G) /ʒ/ → dg → ǧ /dʒ/, for /g/ is [q](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q)

&gt; s /s/ → ts → š /ts/  

&gt; z /z/ → dz → ž /dz/

Because:

1. In the earliest Latin inscriptions, the letters C, K and Q were all used to represent the two sounds /k/ and /ɡ/, which were not differentiated in writing. Of these, Q was used before a rounded vowel (e.g. ⟨EQO⟩ 'ego') …
2. For example, some European languages use G as /ʒ/ or /dʒ/, where /ʒ/ is part of sound. The same situation with C, where in English can be as /ʃ/ — delicious, and for some languages can be as /tʃ/ where /ʃ/ is part of sound. In Azerbaijani alphabet Q is /g/.
3. C /ʃ/ is unvoiced G /ʒ/. K /k/ is unvoiced Q /g/, I guess, good combination.
4. We have so much /ʃ-tʃ/ like Polish “jeszcze” (in my version it would be “jecče” (jectce)) and, on other hand, Ukrainian doesn’t have so much Polish “trz” /t-ʃ/.

For palatalization /ʲ/ I like use digraph with ‘j’.

Palatal consonant like /ɲ/ in Cyrillic is usually like 2 letters for consonant and ‘J’, (trigraph?) like:
&gt; korinnja — коріння (я = ьа = ja).

If use /x/ as ‘x’ then here would be 26 letters and apostrophes for:

- mʼjatc or mʼjač /mjatʃ/ — мʼяч (a ball)
- if without any diacritics: vidʼgaty — віджати (I think that it is like „odžať”)

Or 30 with apostrophe or 35 (plus letters for /ja/, /je/, /ji/, /ju/, /jo/— for example, mäč, but djadjko /dʲadʲko/) without apostrophe.

But all it is, of course, just my fantasies and thoughts. ",Ukraïna — Kyïw,/r/europe/comments/8f44k8/slovak_language_with_46_letters_is_the_largest/dy14at6/,hammile,1524786261

2732,"&gt;It's hard not to know what your priorities are when 90% of the posts you make have the same political undertones, really.

Well, it's not as if I hide them. It's in my flair :O

It still is, however, very judgemental from you to think that even in a case of rape like this one, my priorities must be nationalistic.

I honestly don't think I have been that way here, in this thread nor the others here on this topic, but in fact was just trying to provide further context and confirmation. If another spanaird had been doing so better and sooner than I could, I wouldn't have done it. The only one that didn't back my points was one that thought the sentence was very much ok, justice is all ok, yada yada. And it's good that both of us can say that.

So, I don't want to be insulting here, but I'd even say it's a little paranoid thinking from you in this case.

I'd urge you, instead, to consider the idea that, sometimes, there may be in fact events that will favor our interests without us having to play any kind of 'twist' to them. Right to information happens to have those things, you can inform of shit happening that favors your interests, without you changing a single word of it.

2875,"I'll give you the reason why Belgian law defined lootboxes as gambling since I read the document today.

For something to be gambling (kansspel) it needs to exhibit 4 properties: a random outcome, a wager (inzet), a gain or loss (winst of verlies) as an outcome and a gaming aspect.

I think the random outcome is clear. The gaming aspect does include the fact that it is part of a game, but also simple things like showing slot machine like animations' (probably not exactly what it says in dutch).

The wager might be less clear, but the document does make the distinction of thing that can be bought by game currency or in-game currency. (money you earn and has no monetary value and 'gems'you buy with real money.) Only the later is taken into account.

The gain or loss is also a bit les clear but they mention that a player values  some outcomes better than other. E.g. some skins are better valued than others, this is only further shown by rare or common items.

So the four conditions to call some lootboxes gambling are there in this interpretation.

There are some other things in the document that point out problematic areas in this context and bad practices. (relating to use of specific psychological tricks to evoke gambling addiction and so on, some lack in pegi definitions etc)

They are also mentioning that even lootboxes that are not gambling, because no money is involved, might pull young children towards gambling.

The dossier is actually OK and the remarks do make sense.

I would like to point out that there are already similar discussions in the Nederlands, Germany and so on. I expect something similar to be rolled out in Europe entirely.

I do believe that some responsibility to teach young people how to handle online peer pressure( something mentioned in the document) is a shared responsibility of the society. Or that narrowing down the gambling problem to only lootboxes, or the way this will probably be used by politicians is also not ok.

In case you want to discus details: the games they looked at are overwatch, cs:go, fifa 18 and battlefront 2. The last one is found not to be gambling since they removed the monetary aspect.

2897,"&gt; I’m pretty sure Imperial China had disdain for anything European, well into the 19th century.

I guess that's why they called the Roman Empire ""Daqin"", meaning ""Great China"", huh?

&gt;The term Daqin (Chinese: 大秦; pinyin: Dà qín; Wade–Giles: Ta4-ch'in2), meaning ""Great Qin,"" is derived from the dynasty founded by Qin Shihuangdi, ruler of the State of Qin and China's first emperor who unified China's Warring States by 221 BC.[4] The prefix ""da"" (大) or ""great"" signified that the Roman Empire was on par with the might of the Qin Empire and was viewed as a utopian land located to the northwest of the Parthian Empire.[4] The title ""Daqin"" does not seem to have any phonetic derivation from Latin Roma or Greek Romaikē, although it is possible that the Latin term used for China, Serica (i.e. ""Land of Silk"", derived from Greek Serikon, Chinese si Chinese: 絲; pinyin: sī, meaning silk), originates from the name Qin using Early Middle Chinese pronunciation (with the final syllable pronounced with an -r sound).[5]

&gt; 2. Forby bønnerop i det offentlige rom

&gt; Forslagsstiller: Buskerud FrP

&gt; Flere steder i landet er det nå etablert ordninger hvor moskeer har lov til å spre bønnerop over høyttaler i byer. Dette oppleves som sjenerende og upassende for svært mange. I Norge har vi religionsfrihet, noe som også bør omfatte retten til ikke å bli utsatt for bønnerop i det offentlige rom. Fremskrittspartiets landsmøte vil derfor at det ikke skal tillates bønnerop fra trossamfunn i det offentlige rom.

It is explicitly a ban on call to prayers explicitly targeted at mosques.

2981,"&gt;Today some Basques can show collective narcissism with the Northern Basque language.

Caring about one's own language is being a narcissist?

&gt;In the Bayonne-Anglet-Biarrtiz agglomeration, only 5% of Basques speak Basque, so I think they don't give a shit.

Actually, there's demand for more Basque schooling in the area, but Basque schools do not receive any public funds from the centralised French state, so they're struggling. Every year there are demonstrations in the BAB area and surroundings asking for more education to be made available in Basque.

&gt;I specify ""Northern"" because French Basque is different from Spanish Basque

There isn't a ""Northern French Basque"" as much as there isn't a ""Southern Spanish Basque"". There are several dialects in both sides. Specifically, French Basques speak Lapurdian, Lower Navarrese and Souletin.

&gt;Something you might not know: local languages weren't forbidden

They were not banned, you mean. But you could not use them (and still can't) in the local administration, schools or medical centers.

I don't see how that matters at all though

&gt;That's not the question I asked [...]

The paper discusses if targets of hate speech are being silenced by the hate and I'd say that if the targets can be silenced by hate speech, then hate speech laws are needed as their speech is more valuable than the noise that is the hate speech.  Which means hate speech laws should cover groups (like transpeople, jews, etc.). I think this guy should have been fined if he made a racist 'joke' on the same lines, that could have bad consequenses. 

Saying hate speech laws aren't good because jews still emigrate from Europe is not necessarily true. Historical and economic situations are very important here. Some countries with many jews are going through some harder times rn, religion is a lot less important in Europe than in Israel or usa, so that may affect their decision, and also an increasing amount of Europeans lose their faith, the american and israeli jewish communities are much larger than in any European country today, Europeans are generally more pro-palestine than pro-israel and so on.

Well I´m sorry to burst your bubble mate but what the hell do you expect? Of course they are going to have to lawyer up.

These laws exist first to protect consumers from abuse by companies, for example restaurants not able to sell you a dish made with rotting food or to overprice their dishes or to not give a fuck about hygiene. Secondly these laws are there to protect Small Business from Big Business. These laws are what makes it possible for your buddies to even set up their studio, if everything would be unregulated we would see monopolies everywhere.

You would eat the same shit from the same company day in and out only to go  home to play games made by Ubisoft where every game is now a pay2win service game without any heart or creativity.

3029,"Context from the YouTube comment section by RadianHelixMedia:

&gt;For those who are confused on the time frame of what this is representing, it's not necessarily ""Vikings,"" and more or less not Neolithic. 

&gt;It's Proto-Germanic she's singing here, and in most of their music. It's Pre-Migration Period, 600 years before the Vikings, ~1st Century CE til ~550 when Elder Futhark broke into Younger Futhark. It's based on historical linguistic reconstruction and snippets of text found archeologically and through Tacitus &amp; Saxo Grammaticus, some of which were carved in runes on bone fragments, or described pejoratively by Latin writers, who described the throat singing as like ""howling dogs,"" when it would sound provisionally like in this video, inferred by the Sammi &amp; Hunnic traditions which survived the ages relatively unchanged. 


&gt;Then they kinda do this English language ""rap,"" which is based on descriptions of Galdralag and Seiðalag -- no surviving examples of which exist outside of very, very scant snippets in the Poetic and Prose Edda, and in descriptions by Saxo Grammaticus and possibly by Tacitus. The low growling and hissing, the forked fingers, is based on descriptions of Seiðr magic. That kind of image survived in the inspiration of ""witches"" which Christians were terrorized by, who were real people practicing a similar indigenous artform, and came to become an abstracted meme of its own that evolved &amp; mutated into the 21st century.﻿

This is taken from the YouTube comments, so take it with a grain of salt. It's an amazing performance nonetheless!

3079,"Top topic today in Spain, it's the main headline in all the digital newspapers and will be tomorrow on the physical ones.

**TL;DR:** 5 to 1 situation with a drunk 18yo girl, with unprotected oral, vaginal and anal sex, filming, and theft and disposal of her phone, is considered by the tribunal 'continuous abuse' (9 years), whereas rape charges are dismissed (20-25 years).

Terrible news, not only for the victim, but because what this means and the message it sends.

It's as we've seen in other famous sentences in other countries, where with the lack of proper evidence of resistance or violence it's assumed that the victim gave consent —being extra bad in this case as it's a 5 vs 1 situation.

Huge outrage right now in Spain, particularly by women and mostly anyone with a little of common sense. Only the politicans from specific conservative parties are keeping their mouth shut about it.  There'll be protests, today. 

That being said, the BBC article is a good enough resume. It only misses a few things:

- One of the 3 magistrates —~~whom were all men, I believe~~ **edit:** *I was wrong, one was a woman*— actually asked for absolution as he argued she enjoyed it. Reading his text is truly sickening to the stomach.

- It's worth noting that these guys went to the point of having their gang image tatooed, their texts showed that they were going there for this purpose —as they allegedly did, regularly, to other places—, and some say they even had rape drugs in their possession. One being a Civil Guard, and another a military officer.

- One of these shitbags had the nerve to say that ""she surely enjoyed it more than me"" in the trial. Which is not only affirming she did —enough evidence to show that he's a rapist at mind—, but also that he did not very much —which makes one think of what do these kind of guys need to enjoy sex.

It's truly sickening to see the amount of people defending these guys on the internet. We're very late to the rape culture debate as a country.

If you focus on software development, they teach you how to program in C\+\+ and Java in your first semester. You then finish the semester by taking a 3 week long group project course. In this course they teach you to use Github and how to solve your projects using branches. Your project revolves around writing a small interface on top of a SQL database, so it's both front\- and back\-end programming, with your first basic SQL thrown in. You do this in a typical three\-tier architecture.

That's just a part of what you do in the first semester.

Eventually, your final project \(the last semester of your BSc.\) revolves around solving an actual project for an actual company. This is a four month project, where you're essentially working 8 hours a day, solving real life software development projects out in the business world, often with your own desk at the company's software development offices. A lot of students get their first job this way. If they do well on the project, the company that asked them to do the project quite often hires them.

I'm guessing you do this very differently in Spain?",Iceland,/r/europe/comments/8f18p0/unemployment_rates_in_2017_in_the_eu_regions/dy009u4/,TemporaryEconomist,1524749397

No, but *extra* content with which you can pay with in game currency *does* incur extra costs. Lootboxes mitigate that.

&gt;he current loot box situation is predatory on people who are vulnerable to either a game or a gambling addiction

You are right and I will not argue with you there. What I will say though is that OW offers the best system where you're 1) not restricted on content (of any kind) 2) helps everybody get *more* content. The only thing non-payers are restricted from having are having all items without playing. I agree, to a certain extent it *is* predatory in capturing the cash whales.

The reason I defend OW model is because in the absence of such a model we'll have flat payments for *everybody* and create a worse environment as a result.

3255,"The shame of our political system.

I am very pragamatic in this cases, and the truth be said, the Spanish legal code doesn't consider sex without concent rape, just sexual abuse.

Only 9 countries in Europe consider rape as sex without concent (with or without violence) in their legal codes. 20 European countries signed the treaty of Istanbul of violence against women and domestic abuse whose members compromise to change the laws to protect the victim instead of debating whether there was actual violence or the victim froze and submitted (in 70% of all rapes the victim submitts out of fear according to amnesty international).

In this case, the victim submitted (out of fear) and the judges interpreted it as not explicit violence.

We spaniards should band together and don't vote any party who doesn't include a reform to our rape laws. 

Some years ago a girl was beaten to death for resisting her rape in san Fermín. This case just shows the hypocrisy of our laws.

We europeans need to change our rape laws from laws that put the burden on the victim to defend  herself (or himself) to laws that punish the perpetrator.



Edit: the numbers come from amnesty international. They have decided to count the countries in the uk as separate. 🙄

So basically the only countries who punish sex without consent in europe are the nords, the brits (not Ireland), germany and the dutch. This is absolutely horrifying.

3265,"As with anything that we are scrupulously analysing in this day and age, it is not black and white, but a lot of different shades of grey.

People mention trading cards or sticker packs, and yes I would agree to some degree there is an element of gambling, but I don't feel it is so blatant as lootboxes.

With trading cards it is quite often with parental supervision, when I was a child my mum might have rewarded me with a pack of Pokemon cards if I was a good boy that week and went shopping with her - I agree, the same mental practice is taking place in that if I buy XX amount of Pokemon decks, I will get the one I want. However I couldn't just go out and buy all the decks I wanted as my parents had to step in to fund it - there was my lesson as a child.

Lootboxes are different in that there is no parental supervision, kids often play these games on their own and see pop-ups offering you to buy the lootboxes in game. No one is stepping in and giving the lesson on why it isn't wise to give into that part of your brain thus sending you into the same mental loop gambling addicts do.

As mentioned earlier, it's a grey area, so where does it stop? Banning lootboxes entirely is extreme, however hiding half a video game behind a lootbox/paywall affair is robbery. I think my main issue is you're sold what you believe to be a complete product, but in reality you're only being sold parts of it - rather like you being sold a car but on collecting and driving away, a pop up tells you that you need to pay to get the stereo, fuel gauge and speedometer.

was referring to our government. not the people. What you need to remember is that 1) some papers are reporting things more and some of those e.g. guardian/times/independent are clearly on an anti-brexit tirade. (Btw, compelled to point out i'm a remainer. voted to stay. want to stay but equally when people try to link everything bad that happens to brexit I feel also compelled to point out that it's BS. . 2) some of those incidents are not reported faithfully or accurately. Like the Polish man who was attacked... /r/europe went crazy about it calling us all racist xenophobes... yet it turned out the REAL truth was the Polish man was racist and attacked the kids first.... but yet when anyone pointed that out (there were multiple press sources) it got burried or people just downvoted them to oblivion for not matching up to the story of the evil stupid xenophobic brits. 

I think you will find, statistically, there were a VERY SMALL number of incidents post-brexit. And it's inexcusable, but it's not an every day occurrence. I really think you are just jumping on the anti-British bandwagon that is /r/europe these days or perhaps your perception of events has been skewed by what you read in this sub. 
My country is not like this, it is not like it would appear to be if you get your news solely from reddit.. and when compared to most of Europe we have low rates of such incidents... yet who get's reported? we do.

I honestly do not think there is a huge number of such cases, and, when they are tied in with brexit .. the link is extremely weak. The rate of foreigners being attacked is much larger in other EU countries but since they didn't have an EU referendum, lefties can't link it to anything so they don't talk about it much / as much. 

Bottom line, yes there are racist people, as there are in every country... but such incidents are being reported more for the UK and the link to brexit is very tenuous to say the least. ",,/r/europe/comments/8eycrx/he_served_our_army_protected_our_elders_this_man/dxzuq2e/,[deleted],1524742131

Again going back to early eras of gaming (since it's exactly that, that developers are exploiting) nobody would deny that collecting all the stars in super mario or collecting all X in any other game was considered in-game progression (there's Achievements/Trophies for exactly that), the only difference is that they removed the ability to unlock them naturally through gameplay and put a pricetag next to them, it's still ingame progression for many people.",,/r/europe/comments/8f0y8f/belgium_defines_video_game_loot_boxes_as_illegal/dxzuy8k/,SpikeReynolds,1524742512

3414,"The last sentence proves that you don’t really know anything about Italian modern history.

Well, Berlusconi is greatly followed even today because our population severely lacks a political culture. I believe that a lot of people doesn’t even know how our political system works: for instance you could see a lot of people complaining about how we don’t get to choose the prime minister. I don’t really think our system is flawed, we have pretty big differences between regions (and even between provinces sometimes) that will result in voting for totally different parties. Furthermore Italian political system (which btw I think is great, https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Italy get an opinion on it by yourself) doesn’t really help when it comes to governability. And that’s basically why we have political problems nowdays.

I couldn’t disagree more about what you said about Mussolini. I agree with you that he actually did a lot of bad and unforgivable acts (Matteotti, racial laws...) but you really think that’s why he was voted and that’s all he really did? People those days had multiple reasons to vote Mussolini, he promised a lot to former WW1 soldiers and to people working in factories (people’s political awareness was raising thanks to the Great War). And, when elected, really did something for the country: he gave a lot of economical power to Italy (don’t really want to explain that go read something impartial about the topic), he also gave more importance to Christian church (I’m not a religious person, but he got away from a really tough situation. Read something about that too), reformed our school system, reclaimed the agro-pontino... So claiming that Mussolini did absolutely nothing but sinking our country is totally wrong. And I’m ABSOLUTELY NOT a fascist to begin with.",Italy,/r/europe/comments/8ese6h/today_is_liberation_day_in_italy_buon_25_aprile/dxzrgwe/,Kamik77,1524735337
3415,"Again you're hanging your whole tantrum on a word. Yes Fascism was a dictatorship which was supported by most of civilians, yes said dictatorship and its followers were guilty of many crimes and massacres. But when the dictator is overthrown and arrested, the army and government is given to an anti-fascist  coalition which sign an armistice with the Allies and surrender, but then said dictator is freed from prison by a military force which then occupies part of the country and forms an illegitimate puppet state with said dictator who has lost most of his consensus. When people and partigiani start fighting the dictator supporrted for the most by the nazi army, and every time that a nazi soldier is killed by a partigiano 10 civilians are executed. When the Cities get rid of the Nazi and the Italian Fascist on their own or with the help of the Allies, and the dictator tries to flee and find shelter in Switzerland but then gets killed, his corpse hanged and exposed in a public plaza, and then humiliated by the people who ""pay it a visit"". In that sense we talk about an occupation of the Nazis and Italian Fascist which was unwanted and we talk about liberation from the people and the dictator and the ideology which once we supported but then turned against.

And then you say we whitewash history when on liberation day we do literally the opposite. There have been manifestation everywhere in Italy to denounce the crimes that Italian Fascism has committed in Europe, and the people who supported it and who still support it. Again I don't understand what's so bad about that.

3430,"So far, Washington has allowed the EU states exemptions in the levies on steel and aluminium products. Government representatives fear that these are now to be lifted.

The US tariffs on steel and aluminium imports will also affect the European Union from 1 May according to estimates from German government circles. This would not extend the derogations in favour of the EU.

""From today's perspective, one has to assume that the duties will come on May 1,"" said a German government representative on Thursday shortly before Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU)'s departure for Washington. There she will meet US President Donald Trump, who has sparked a trade dispute with the customs.

So far, the US measures have mainly affected China. The EU actually hopes to be permanently exempted from the new tariffs. Merkel prefers a broad dialogue with the USA instead of mutual punitive tariffs, the government representative continued.

Merkel wants to prevent escalation of trade dispute during US visit
Federal Economics Minister Peter Altmaier (CDU) expects a coordinated EU position on further action next week, according to information from Wednesday. ""We do well to avoid any escalation,"" Altmaier had said.

The EU is currently in the process of coordinating its position. ""We have a responsibility to avoid uncontrolled competition for tariffs."" The EU wants to reach a common line in the negotiations with the USA. Altmaier pointed out that there is a ""controversial debate"" in France about which negotiation offers should be made to the USA.

Chancellor Merkel wants to prevent an escalation in the trade dispute during her talks with US President Donald Trump in Washington on Friday, as government spokesperson Steffen Seibert had said. Altmaier said it was important that there should be a permanent exemption from US duties on steel and aluminium. The federal government is against protectionism, Altmaier affirmed. The World Trade Organization WTO is more important than ever.

With a complaint to the World Trade Organization (WTO) a week ago, the EU had kept open the possibility of retaliatory tariffs against the US. In a document published by the WTO, the European Union officially called for the start of consultations with the US administration. For its part, the EU could impose protective tariffs on US products such as whiskey, motorcycles and jeans.

3438,"&gt; A system that produces bilingual citizens is a different thing than a bilingual system.

That's how it is defined here. When this bilingual model was established in 1983, it was precisely to have bilingual citizens. It's not a monolingual system. It's bilingual because students reach a perfect almost equal level on both languages (Spanish is still a little higher, but decimals of difference). That's how bilingualism is understood here: a student must be able to write, read and speak perfectly in both languages equally. If this is not achieved, then there's no bilingualism and the model would have failed.

&gt; as you admit in my example

You showed an example of a non-bilingual system for Catalonia, because it wouldn't produce bilingual citizens. 

&gt; Calling the Catalan system bilingual like you insist to do may lead anyone to believe that Catalan and Spanish are used in the Catalan schools to the same extent, when that is not the case.

I don't insist, that's how the system is established to be: bilingual. Catalan language immersion is the tool to achieve bilingualism. If immersion wasn't necessary to achieve that, then it wouldn't exist. Results are what matter.

Catalan and Spanish are not used to the same extent. But this is not how a model is defined to be bilingual. We could have had a model in Catalonia where 50% of subjects are in Catalan and the other 50% are in Spanish. This would mean both languages are used in the school to the same extent, right? But this wouldn't be bilingualism, because the level of Catalan the majority of students would achieve would be really low, in big contrast with their Spanish. Thus, that would be a model where students learn perfect Spanish and have some lower knowledge in Catalan. This can't be called bilingualism.",Catalonia,/r/europe/comments/8ewete/in_spanish_the_european_parlament_asks_the/dxzrk21/,Gerardpb2,1524735558

But what happened was that as the people started drinking skimmed milk and always getting the low-fat options on every food product, they started getting more and more hungry from the absence of fat in their meals. This constant little hunger meant that the consumption of sugary snacks and quick carbohydrates skyrocketed.

No, you've already agreed that you can't treat this as ""one large seesaw"", because an imbalance in one area doesn't balance out an inbalance in another area.

If you are Dutch, even if you are willing to work for the same pittance, often you are *legally not allowed* because it would be less than the Dutch minimum wage.

Also, in one fell swoop that's 100 years of accumulated worker's rights down the drain, for anybody at the bottom end of the scale. They have no rights, and even though you technically do, you can just be replaced by a Pole if you get uppity. And it's not really fair to the Poles either, they have no rights.

I don't blame the individual Poles for any of this, but it's understandable that people get upset. It would already help a lot if they banned these shady constructions and instead required that people be hired under the laws of the country they actually work in, but then again I think this was the whole reason to open the borders in the first place.

The No True Scotsman fallacy is based on subtly changing the definition of the group that is referred to. In your example you have the person being an actual Greenpeace-member. Therefore it's correct that it's a No True Scotsman to then claim that he wasn't Greenpeace, as you outlined.

However, the group we have in this case here is ""feminists"". And the definition of feminism is aiming for equal rights. This woman here obviously has no interest in this whatsoever, on the contrary she wishes to abolish this in favour of women. That does not fit the definition of feminism. Yet you seem to think that she is a feminist.

Objecting to that is like saying ""transport helicopters are useless, because they're highly-vulnerable to enemy fire and aren't good offensive tools"".  Well, yeah.  You use the transport helicopters to move soldiers, not to drop them directly into the middle of a fight.

Even stuff like heavy APCs (like a [Namer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namer) or something) will be vulnerable to modern [ATGMs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATGM).  And you aren't going to get much more armor than that.

Trucks are also vulnerable to fire and aren't much by way of offensive tools, yet they are still used as a major component of military transport.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorized_infantry

&gt;In NATO and most other western countries, motorized infantry is infantry that is transported by **trucks or other un-protected motor vehicles**. It is distinguished from mechanized infantry, which is carried in armoured personnel carriers or infantry fighting vehicles, and from light infantry, which can typically operate autonomously from supporting elements and vehicles for relatively long periods and may be airborne.

-

&gt;Motorization provides no direct tactical advantage in small-unit combat, as trucks and jeeps are vulnerable to artillery and small arms fire. However, in larger battles, motorized infantry has an advantage in mobility allowing them to move to critical sectors of the battlefield faster, allowing better response to enemy movements, and the ability to outmaneuver the enemy.

3635,"&gt; I'm not saying Poles should be ashamed to not like Germans and I very much stated that this is very understable when considering history.

To make that perfectly clear I don't have problems with Germans due to historical issues. I will bring them **IF** they are relevant but I don't find them as obstacles from get go. To put that into perspective, I work for quite iconic German brand, drive German car and my aunt sister marries a German this weekend if this isn't sign of lack of prejudice I don't know what is. Saying that I stopped seeing Germans as superhuman, too. Our branch was green field investment. we had many cheap IT workers and we have very sophisticated environment created. For example we got over 200 lines of products while most other branches have under 20. Now, when new German CFO is appointed we are forced to conform to much lower standards to save costs in group which will have impact on our performance but we were ""awarded"" higher targets to boot. To add insult to injury despite having over a dozen years old streak of positive financial results our wages are 1/4th of Germans without sign of improvement on the horizon. So it is quite real life example of Polish-German relation. Saying that it, of course, don't affect my assessment of average German but allow to do so without complexes.

&gt; griefed about Germanisation deny any type of Polonisation in the PLC's Lithuania

AFAIR Polonisation in PLC wasn't forced and nominally GDL and Crown were equals with Lithuanian rulers on Polish throne so it was quite different to Prussian occupation. Saying that there was interwar period, too...

&gt; I Just find it regrettable that anything comparable to Franco-German Reconciliation (that does not deny any crimes, actions or events) is pretty much unimaginable between PL and DE for the time being.

I think that Polish-German Reconciliation took place. Problem is most Poles are quite insecure and resort to defensive stance when challenged. We are aware German superiority in standard of living, organisation and institutions. Taking into an account that Poles growing up in Germany don't differ much from their native peers people ask questions, if we are so similar why outcome differ so much? This create tension. And then there are politicians which try to get support by stirring this pandora's box.

&gt; And on an individual level in Real Life the Poles I know are very pleasant

We could say the same. I was very pleasant surprised when I was accompanied by young German from Munich to Swiss border when I was in taize meeting many years ago. He offered his help and I don't know if I didn't overused his hospitality but young kid in foreign country (which I was) found this act very helpful and didn't know better.

&gt; My comment adresses broader social sentiments that seem to exist and are very visible here in this subredddit.

We got much to catch up and sometime it looks like Germans are creating obstacles in our way up. Being warmblood we act on impulses and we got narrative that support that stance. Saying that many people interact with Germans and with deeper interactions there is little space for maintaining relations based on prejudices because they don't work efficiently, this way. Part of the problem is we see Nazi Germany as lawful evil forcibly converted after war to lawful neutral if no out right good while we perceive themself as chaotic good with tendency to gravitate toward neutral. We see Germans as organised, punctual, obedient, without sense of humour so perfect worker. Quite set of prejudice if you'd ask me but it wasn't my main idea. We perceived ourself as innovative, loving freedom, quite relaxed kind, perfect leaders and yet we have to conform to inferior Germans overlords and cognitive dissonance happen. Some cope with that better some resort to history. I'm afraid there is not easy way. Process of dissolving prejudices and losing perceived superiority need time, quite a lot of it. But contrary to common sentiment I thing it proceed quite fast.

3813,"&gt; What kind of propaganda have you been imbibing? Hungary is a landlocked nation. It is literally impossible for them to be the first landing place of migrants, and thus impossible for them to be responsible for said migrants.

That's just factually inaccurate, Hungary has a border to a Non-EU country, Serbia, which the refugees were coming from, you'd have to prove that they had first been in Greece which you couldn't because Greece stopped vetting them so Hungary was responsible for their vetting.

&gt; But once Germany declared they were ignoring said agreement, and told others to to do the same, migrants started rent shopping around Europe for the most generous welfare benefits.

That's an outright lie, FIRST Hungary put them onto busses to Austria, after that Merkel acknowledged that nobody was following Dublin anymore. Merkel did not end Dublin; Greece and Hungary did. Merkel had to come up with another plan. Either she ignored Hungary's plea or she spreads them evenly, she decided to help Hungary, the country who let them all in.

&gt; Germany is demanding places like Hungary and Poland ""take their fair share""

Hungary already had the second highest amount of asylum applications in 2015, right after Sweden. Nobody wants to have them, but if Germany is forced to let them in, then so should everyone be, that includes Poland, it's a European crisis.

&gt; That is absolute, verifiable nonsense. She threw open the doors and helped exacerbate the crisis. Numbers are falling now because she is walking back her own policy.

That's just wrong, her policy has always been anti-immigrant from the very first day, nothing changes. Merkel got involved in late September 2015 when she 'opened the border' the numbers of immigrants to Europe began to fall from November 2015 onwards, those that came in October 2015 had already left their home and were on their way to Europe, so almost immediately after Merkel got involved immigration dropped from 220,000 in October 2015 to now 3000 per month to all of Europe through the mediterranean route. You're spreading fake news.


&gt; Saying and doing are very different things. [...] And when Italy threatened to close those ports

Merkel is not the EU. From your article:

&gt; ""We support and we understand Italy's concern and **we support their call for a change in the situation**,"" European Commission spokeswoman Natasha Bertaud told reporters.

&gt; ""But what we're also saying is that any change in policy should first be discussed with other member states, and also properly communicated to the NGOs who are running these boats so that they have time to prepare.""

&gt; German Chancellor Angela Merkel stressed the need to resolve the political situation in Libya but fell short of meeting Italy's demands to accept more new migrants who arrive at Italian ports.

-

&gt; Deportations? You mean like the truck attacker in Germany who was supposed to be deported two years ago? 

Correct, his deportation case was managed by the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, governed by the left-wing SPD and Greens,in response to their failure that state went to Merkel's right-wing party after that and the Cologne assaults.

&gt; Who are they integrating, if they actually plan to be rid of them...?

Both is done at the same time since we don't know who is going to stay and who isn't and for how long. But until they are gone, which can take years, they have to learn the laws, language and culture of Europe if they want to be allowed to roam on the streets of Germany.

3827,"&gt; So you dont consider an assimilated immigrant to be Italian? OK, and then I am being called the hateful one...

Saying she was ethnically Italian would be denying evidence

&gt; 'NOT ALL MUSLIMS'.... take a look at the article of how many of these incidents happen

That's why i said many still are narrow minded, education can solve this problem

&gt; Azerbaijan is an extremely conservative country, as far as I remember it is the most homophobic out of all the countries in Europe and Caucasus, something like 98% of people there say homosexuality is morally unacceptable which is the hgihest number out of all surveyed. Just because a country isnt a full retard terrorist state like a lot of Muslim countries does not make them liberal.

Azerbaijan is a very modern state and being homosexual there is legal, the social anti-homosexuality thought, despite is undeniable, isn't as much of a problem as you say (i'd like a source on your statement) and is more a remnant of the soviet Era rather than religion, also, i doubt you'll find many pro-gay rights people in eastern europe so saying it is a ""muslim"" thing is wrong, really wrong

&gt; Cool story, which part of my post was a lie?

You said i deny facts, i'm not criticizing you criticizing what happened, What happened to Sana was a despicable act, i'm criticizing the fact you're using the news to just hate on muslims without actually caring about the girl

&gt; In other words 'I dont like people who dont take part in my echo chamber'

I actually like debates, and can you deny what i said ? Europe is becoming increasingly anti-muslim and a new wave of nationalism is approaching, Italy already elected populist idiots (and trust me, idiots is the most accurate word to describe Di Maio and Salvini) and this situation reflects on r/europe

&gt; Right so we are no longer allowed to criticize murderous Muslims who murder their children for becoming westernized because that's turning us into Literally Hitler? Should we just ignore this and be like nothing to see here, bye?

You can criticize as much as you want and i can criticize your Hypocrisy of exploiting news and acting like you care about the victim as much as i want, freedom of speech is our right. I know what you're trying to do, you're trying to make me appear like the bad guy by suggesting i support this violence, which is untrue (btw this exact tactic was used by Allesandra Mussolini against Civati [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74ffi-4lrD8) , it is a pathetic tactic people use when they are clearly struggling don't use it), as i said this is a despicable act and i'm criticizing you for another reason

&gt; And despite their small numbers, they still cause a huge amount of trouble. It really is shocking how such a small minority of people could stick out so much.

True, it's because they lack education, even Italian-americans in the USA were considered ""violent rats"" and produced famous criminals like al Capone but now they are the upper class and very few are criminals nowadays thanks to education, no debate on this

&gt; 'Only 9%', haha that's a disasterous number and it is only going to keep growing.

It won't grow much, as i said their fertility rate will adjust in one generation or two (like every other ethnicity ever did in other host countries, fertility rates are a matter of education and in Germany they will have access to german education)

&gt; Most of them do not marry native Germans.

That's why i said ""many"" not ""most""

&gt; At the moment.

The number of muslims with citizenship might rise, true, but they will still be a minority

&gt; Which doesnt really matter when you constantly let in more and more of them over decades as the new generations always have more kids, it's a never ending cycle with immigration

With Syria slowly getting more stable numbers of accepted middle eastern migrants have became smaller, and again, most of Germany's migrants come from eastern europe and southern europe

&gt; No, it's basic statistics based on current projections.

As i said, they don't take account of birthrate decline, they just think muslims will keep the current birthrate, and anyway results of those estimates range from 10-15% to 45-50%, the latter number being ridiculously high and taking no variable into account

&gt; Yeah they are using the scenario that you are trying to push to demonstrate what the results of it would be, obviously.
Seriously go and try to convince someone else with your bullshit because I am not falling for it.

I'm not trying to push an high immigration scenario, imo immigration **SHOULD** be regulated, i'm just pissed of how toxic people like you behave on the internet and how people like you try to depict muslims as monsters instead of people by spreading lies

So here in the East, we are double fucked compared to our western allies. We are stucked between all the free escapism with a tip of the finger and a horrible economic status at the same time.

""The frequent statement that more than 90 percent of antisemitic acts are committed by (German) right-wing extremists is doubted not only by civil servants, but ultimately also by the ""Independent Expert Group on Anti-Semitism"" appointed by the Bundestag [= German federal parliament]. The scientists submitted a report on behalf of the German government in April. It states that xenophobic and antisemitic acts are basically classified as ""politically motivated right-wing crime, if no further specifics are identifiable"" and ""no suspects have become known"". The experts wrote that this ""could lead to a picture distorted to the right about the motivation for the crime and the circle of perpetrators. They also stated that a ""systematic underestimation of anti-Semitic incidents"" must be expected.""

Original:

""An der oft getätigten Aussage, mehr als 90 Prozent der antisemitischen Taten würden von (deutschen) Rechtsextremen begangen, zweifeln nicht nur Beamte, sondern letztlich auch der vom Bundestag eingesetzte „Unabhängige Expertenkreis Antisemitismus“. Die Wissenschaftler hatten im Auftrag der Bundesregierung im April einen Bericht vorgelegt. Darin heißt es, fremdenfeindliche und antisemitische Taten würden grundsätzlich der „politisch motivierten Kriminalität Rechts“ zugeordnet, „wenn keine weiteren Spezifika erkennbar“ und „keine Tatverdächtigen bekannt geworden sind“. So entstehe „möglicherweise ein nach rechts verzerrtes Bild über die Tatmotivation und den Täterkreis“, schrieben die Experten. Sie erklärten zudem, es müsse mit einer „systematischen Unterschätzung antisemitischer Vorfälle“ gerechnet werden.""

3997,"I think a lot of people's opinions regarding this issue are slightly tinted due to their experiences with lootboxes as gamers. I personally see a few problems with this.

In gambling, you genuinely win or lose. You put money on the table, and you either leave with more money or no money. That's a net loss. The same can not be said about lootboxes. **You are guaranteed a product by purchasing a lootbox**, which simply is not the case in true gambling.   \*

This wasn't done when trading cards were around. **Trading cards are essentially the same thing as lootboxes, yet nothing was done.** Kids are still limited by their pocket-money, so nothing much has changed. (This isn't much of a 'problem', but rather a noticable inconsistency)

CSGO is 18+. So ideally children can not purchase the game. Yet here we are, pushing ban on CSGO lootboxes to ""protect the children"". This indicates a few things. Namely, the age-rating system is not working and/or parents no longer care about what their children buy/do. **Banning lootboxes is NOT addressing the real issue here. This is as stupid as banning sex in video games ""because of the children"".** 
*Edit*: Children were not mentioned in the article, but I believe this factor played a big role in this decision. However feel free to correct me; perhaps Belgian law is very strict on online gambling, and this is their reason behind this decision?

*^(I believe one can only make this argument against CSGO/Dota, where you can actually point to a ""net loss"" in money due to the market value of items.

4020,"To give you a rough idea of how much Multinationals support Ireland:

Foreign multinationals dominate Ireland's economy, attracted by Ireland's corporate tax regime and its three multinational tax schemes (the double Irish, the single malt and capital allowances for intangible assets scheme), which can deliver effective Irish corporate tax rates of 0-3% for firms with substantial intellectual property. For example, foreign multinationals in Ireland:

Directly employ one-quarter of the Irish private sector workforce;[12]

Create ""high-value"" jobs at an average multinational wage of €85k (€17.9bn wage roll for 210,443 staff) vs. Irish domestic industrial wage of €35k;[15]

Directly contribute €28.3bn in 2016 in taxes (€5.5bn), wages (€17.9bn on 210,443 staff) and capital spending (€4.9bn);[14][15]

Pay 80% of all Irish corporation and business taxes;[13]

Potentially pay over 50% of all Irish salary taxes (due to higher paying jobs), 50% of all Irish VAT, and 92% of all Irish customs and excise duties;

(this was claimed by a leading Irish tax expert (and Past President of the Irish Tax Institute), but is not fully verifiable)[60]

Create 57% of private sector non-farm value-add (40% of value-add in Irish services and 80% of value-add in Irish manufacturing);[12][61]

Make up 14 of the top 20 Irish companies (by 2017 turnover) (see table below).[16]

4044,"&gt;There were some quite famous pogroms that happened against Armenians in the last years of SU.

Hmm... Do you even know the actual history of the conflict or you only know the supposed famous? Did you know that many Azerbaijanis were ethnically cleansed in various parts of Nagorno-Karabakh and were kicked out of their homes (many killed as well) in Armenia? I wonder why people always emphasize Armenian side and not Azerbaijani side. 

You mention oppression of Armenians citing pogroms. But did you know the pogroms (only a couple occurred) started **after** Armenians declared that they were seceding from Azerbaijan and many Azerbaijanis fleeing as refugees?

&gt;I don't see why Armenians had any duty to stay in Azerbaijan, just because those pesky Soviets happened to have drawn the borders they way they did.

This is failed logic, secondly ~~Nagorno~~-Karabakh was in Azerbaijani hands during the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic before Russians annexed it. 

Problems arose when autonomy was revoked and when Azerbaijanis began immigrating to the region. How dare Azerbaijanis for immigrating to a region which is recognized to be apart of their territory? By these same standards, Russia shouldn't even exist. Half of the people in Russia don't want to be apart of Russia. Imply this same sort of logic toward others as well, such as your own country...

I think of it like this- whenever someone says ""group X is more Y than Z"", is it trivially wrong that every member of X is more Y than Z?

4166,"&gt;Again, you haven't given a solution.

I gave you 2 solutions that would be proportional to the threat.

&gt;And I'm not talking about assault weapons on the street of Berlin but rather more police in areas where there's a lot of Jews at least.

We are already doing that, as i said 350 police officers are already exclusively protecting known Jewish buildings. Thing is, the event that started this was not in a typical area with a high number of Jews.

Throwing more police officers will not solve the issue that some people are anti-semites, only education (with potential lawsuits, fines and jail) can prevent such attacks in the long run. If a police officer is present, sure people don't openly attack others. But that will not get rid of the of the core issue and mostly moves the illegal acts to another place or time.

What you don't want to understand is that not everything warrants a total escalation, which was my entire point when i replied to ""greater stance towards protecting the jewish community"" the way i did. Each action must be proportional to the cost and gain. What we currently have deployed is enough to prevent most crimes.

And as /user/rEvolutionTU has said, the total number of crimes committed against Jews, is not high enough to throw more man-hours / funds at the problem. Out of the 1453 registered crimes, only 32 were violent and 160 were property damage. It simply isn't big enough a problem to use more resources.

4167,"For those that do not know, in Catalonia all public education is mandated to be in Catalan exclusively with a couple hours dedicated to learning Spanish per week (So history/maths/natural sciences etc by law all need to be in the Catalan language)

The effect of this is that Spanish children do significantly worse than their Catalan peers or Spanish speaking children in regions of similar development

For anyone that reads Spanish here is a round up of an international study of the matter[2015 PISA report](https://www.ecestaticos.com/file/456ad2f934dbecae008b9ed60c2276b8/1488375060-analisis-de-los-resultados-de-pisa-2015-en-cataluna.pdf)

So, for example the report says that Spanish speaking children are twice as likely to fail than their Catalan counterparts (defining failing as being unable to pass the most basic level of math) having 50% greater rates than regions with similar development within Spain (Navarre, Aragon or Madrid being the examples), Spanish speaking children feeling the least integrated in their schools in the whole peninsula, 72% of students that repeat one course being spanish and 90% of 2 or more courses being Spanish speaking. The people that made the report also pointed out the Generalitat does not provide such figures and they can only be found in international studies.

At best this is going to result in a system where FIFA19 comes with a belgian version that has all the grind of having lootboxes but with no option to buy them. At worst this is going to result in FIFA19 not being sold in Belgium. The one I have a real problem with being on this list is Overwatch. What is the clear wage there? You put in a euro and get 4 things that aren't actually worth anything. CS:GO i understand since you can essentially sell the guns on the steam market place so that can be seen as actual gambling. In FIFA you can sell your players (for ingame currency i think, i'm not really sure) so that can be seen as buying varying amounts of ingame currency for the price of a pack, but i just don't see it in Overwatch.

&gt;The move “could make it easy to jail journalists as 'spies’ for obtaining leaked information and see them jailed for up to 14 years”, the report found.

Are you kidding me?

More [here](https://cpj.org/blog/2017/03/uks-proposed-espionage-act-will-treat-journalists-.php).

&gt;Journalists in Britain are becoming increasingly alarmed by the government's apparent determination to prevent them from fulfilling their mission to hold power to account. The latest manifestation of this assault on civil liberties is the so-called Espionage Act. If passed by parliament, it could lead to journalists who obtain leaked information, along with the whistle blowers who provide it to them, serving lengthy prison sentences.

4263,"There is a lot more to it than this, but a simple explanation...

It is part of the UK, but citizens there have the right to Irish citizenship as well due to the good Friday agreement. 

Ireland was brought into the UK in a very different way from Scotland, and they were obviously a lot less pro UK than what Scotland is. In the early 20th century the calls for Irish home rule increased. The UK government diddling around for ages and eventually sending in the army to keep the peace led to the declaration of the Irish free state, which (after a lot of discussions) led to the republic of Ireland being officially recognised with the condition that what became Northern Ireland stayed in the UK. 

Obviously some were not happy about this and many more decades of violence led to an eventual agreement to the state we currently have, with the good Friday agreement. 

People in Northern Ireland can be British or Irish or both. They have a unified rugby team, they have separate football teams (and can play in either), they are required to have power sharing in their devolved parliament. Lots of other fun things.

So then, if while her husband is living she is joined to another man, she shall be called an adulteress; but if her husband dies, she is free from the law, so that she is not an adulteress though she is joined to another man.  Therefore, my brethren, you also were made to die to the Law through the body of Christ, so that you might be joined to another, to Him who was raised from the dead, in order that we might bear fruit for God. For while we were in the flesh, the sinful passions, which were aroused by the Law, were at work in the members of our body to bear fruit for death. But now we have been released from the Law, having died to that by which we were bound, so that we serve in newness of the Spirit and not in oldness of the letter.

4311,"&gt; Personally, yes, but with the European humanist spirit in mind, no. Everybody should be able to belief whatever they want EXCEPT if that belief culturally, mentally and/or physically endangeres/hurts peoples, which Islam does.

I didn't mean that as a crusade, but the Chruch (or for that matter any institution with a good moral substitute, I prefer older ones that have survived the centuries because we know that they work in the long run) could send out missionaries to places where the government won't or can't act.

&gt; if we did not allow them to build mosques in the first place, that level (of liberalism) would already have been achieved.

I'm pretty sure building churches, temples and mosques is protected by freedom of religion in most countries in Europe that protect religion constitutionally, I know Germany does. Circumcision would be much easier to tackle since you'd also get progressives on board.

&gt; Keeping Gaddafi in power would be hypocritical.

I strongly believe that is was/is a necessity, if we could find other countries to do that for us we probably would have already. At the moment we desperately need Erdogan, it would be foolish to try to get rid of him if the alternative would be all of Syria on the shore of Greece, no matter how authoritarian he might become.

&gt;we could still build refugee camps on foreign soil and send immigrants back to it. The European Union aids so many countries of which the citizens come to Europe, we can cut any form of aid

Sounds simple on paper but we desperately try exactly that with moderate success, we should still continue to try though.

4361,"In every single thread I see about electric cars someone shows up to claim that they are worse for climate change than gasoline-powered vehicles. This is bullshit. Some numbers here to make this clear:

A cheap electric car, the Renault Zoe, uses about 16,5 kWh/100km. The battery charging efficiency is around 0.8, and the electric transmission efficiency is around 0.935, so it needs about 22 kWh/100 km, considered at the power plant. Now let's suppose you charge it exclusively from the worst coal power plant in Europe, Niederaußem, that emits 1.2 kgC02/kWh. You emit then 26.5 kgCO2/100km.

Now let's compare it with a cheap gasoline-powered vehicle, that uses about 10l/100km. Burning one litre of gasoline emits around 2.36 kg of CO2 at the tailpipe, and [refining it](https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/ask-mr-green/hey-mr-green-how-much-co2-generated-producing-and-transporting-gallon-gas) something between 0.4 and 0.8 kg, so picking the lowest number gives us 27.6 kgCO2/100km.

So even considering the worst coal power plant in Europe the electric car wins. If you consider instead the average power plant emission, which is around 0.5 in Europe (and going down), you get 11 kgCO2/100km, less than half of the gasoline-powered vehicle.",Europe,/r/europe/comments/8es0k1/electric_buses_are_hurting_the_oil_industry/dxy4qkc/,araujoms,1524671134

4387,"&gt;The withdrawal agreement is whatever the EU and UK decide it is. At the minimum it's about the way the exit occurs, but it can include anything that both parties want.

No it can't, it's limited by the scope of Article 50 (and the other rules set in the treaties). 
For example, you can't fit something like a mixed trade agreement into the A50 deal because the ratification process defined in Art. 50 (QMV) 
isn't compatible with the ratification process necessary for a mixed trade agreement (QMV + national ratification).

&gt;Not really, at best it is a payment for the UK's portion of things the EU had agreed to fund in the future, it's not a payment for services rendered (the UK isn't behind in its payments to the EU as far as I am aware).

The yearly member state contributions are calculated to cover the expenses that need to be paid that year. Decisions to spend money are obviously always made *before* the money is spent, 
so there's always a gap between the spending commitments and the actual spending. (for example, most of the expenditure for an infrastructure project will happens years after it's financing has been agreed)

http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/eu-annual-budget/

This gap is called the 'reste à liquider'(RAL) and Britains share of it is a large chunk of the 'divorce bill', Pension/sickness insurance liabilities for EU staff are another big chunk.

Let's math.    
about [35MJ/l](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline#Comparison_with_other_fuels), at 30% efficiency in a combustion engine gives about 10MJ/l of kinetic energy, and [8.91/3.78=**2.36kgCO2**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline#CO2_production)     
Those same 10MJ ([=2.78kWh](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=10MJ+in+Wh) of kinetic energy (ignoring the fact that EV are much more heavier than regular vehicles due to the batteries extra mass) will come from a much more efficient electric motor, say 80%, so 3.5kWh in the motor, lets also assume a very efficient battery with 90%, that's 3.86kWh in the battery, lets ignore the grid (100% efficiency), and only consider the very efficient Bełchatów power plant (which I guess is not the only coal power plant in Poland), that gives us 8.77kWh out of the plant.    
At [1.09MtCO2/TWh=1,090kg/kWh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_least_carbon_efficient_power_stations), that gives us a bit less than **10tons of CO2**.   
You are right that I did not count the bringing of oil to the car's tank, but it would need to take 4000 times more energy to bring the liter of oil to the car for the coal to be relevant (and oil would become completely uneconomic due to a terrible [EROI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_returned_on_energy_invested)).

You can see how easy it was to introduce new developments in the First World War and the second one also saw some major improvements, but costs have been growing bigger and bigger. Could France afford itself a fourth-generation aircraft? Apperantly yes. Fifth-generation? Now that's a problem. 

Furthermore France has a bigger military spending to other E.U. members by a large margin(only Poland is close at 2.0%, then it's Italy at 1.5% and Germany at 1.2%), so it's not like all militaries are equal.

If bigotry against Jews by immigrants should be punished by the state should bigotry against Muslims by immigrants be punished by the state? What about natives who don't like Muslims?

Here we go.

&gt; committed the same massacres

No he didn't...

&gt; pardoned genocide perpetrators and welcomed them into his government

He hated CUP cadres with a passion. Most of them he banished and didn't even allow their remains to be returned to the country. Some got pardoned despite him. Look up his speeches about them. He wasn't a one man government, if he were he'd manage to pass the land reform bill he dedicated his life to and we probably wouldn't be dealing with these feudal leftovers we are now.

&gt; continued the same nationalistic policies that caused the genocide

He was a cultural nationalist. I don't agree with his view of ""nation"" either, but ethnic nationalism and cultural nationalism aren't even close.

&gt; and actually started denial of the genocide

No he didn't. I don't know how else to answer that, your own quote actually has him acknowledging the 1915 genocide.

&gt; I don’t wish to talk about the beginning stages of the World War, and **what the Allied powers are talking about is certainly not the shameful act that belongs to that distant past.** Alleging that **this kind of disaster is being executed in our country today,** they have demanded that we stop doing it...

He is talking about after the republic era, accepting the horrors of 1915 literally on the sentence above. He's answering British propaganda that accuses his government of continuing the genocide.

4561,"It lasted 48 years, so it varied a lot. It started as a military dictatorship, evolved into a fascist regime with roman salutes and all (and concentration camps for dissidents), and then transformed into more ""burocratic"" repression where its violence was more hidden.

When it was overthrown, it was waging a bloody colonial war for 13 years in 3 African countries (yes, we still had huge colonies in 1974). Political repression was absolute, elections weren't free, censorship was heavy in the press, and once in a while a dissident was killed. A political police harassed, arrested and tortured dissidents and had informers hidden amongst the population. Women were considered inferior to men, and their roles were enforced as traditional by laws and education. School curriculum was heavily propagandistic. Separation of church and state *de facto* did not exist. In regard to labour rights, a 'corporativist' system made sure workers had no real rights, and other kinds of unions were prohibited. Poverty and illiteracy, among many other human development indicators, put Portugal severely behind the West.

It wasn't a full blown fascist dictatorship in 1974 like in the 30s because if it were, it would have collapsed long before. But it was an oppressive dictatorship in every sense of the word.

Fun fact: Amnesty International was founded in 1961 by a British man inspired by a news article he read about two Portuguese students sentenced to 7 years in prison for shouting ""Viva a Liberdade"" (long live freedom) in a Lisbon café.

Edit: forgot to mention arts were also heavily censored, with books and songs being forbidden. One such song was chosen by the revolutionaries as a signal during the Revolution (played on a radio at 00h20 after it was occupied), and it became a symbol of this day and of democracy: https://youtu.be/Ha-h5bPSxQE

4626,"&gt; The Normans partially invaded Ireland

There was some Game of Thrones level stuff going on around that time. Diarmait Mac Murchada, the King of Leinster, had his title revoked by Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair, the High King of Ireland, because he had abducted another king's wife. Diarmait wanted his title back and eventually aspired to be the High King of Ireland himself, so he fled to England to seek help from King Henry II. Henry refused direct help but allowed Diarmait to petition nobles within his kingdom for mercenary support. Richard de Clare, the 2nd Earl of Pembroke, later known as Strongbow, agreed to provide assistance in return for Diarmait's daughter's hand in marriage and the promise of inheriting the title of King of Leinster. It started the Norman Invasion of Ireland and Diarmait would ultimately get his title back, with Henry II as his overlord. However, Henry II was concerned about the lack of control he had over Strongbow and the other Norman warlords, and so he launched an invasion of his own the following year. He ultimately reined them in and the mercenaries swore fealty. The Normans had secured a foothold in Ireland and the period is often noted as the starting point of England's relationship with the island.

The popular narrative amongst Irish nationalists is that it kicked off 800 years of British rule in Ireland. The reality is that it's a lot more nuanced than that. Diarmait Mac Murchada is often regarded as a traitor, however it's incredibly anachronistic to link future British imperialism with the what he did. He didn't seek to assist an English invasion of Ireland, and it's arguable that Henry II had no initial interest in invading Ireland either. The Normans were mercenaries whose heads were turned by the promise of titles. Henry II invaded to bring them under control, not to subdue Ireland.

&gt; but had become more or less Irish by the time England really started to exert control on Ireland a few centuries later.

Going to the doctor \(when you are at the weakest point of your life because you are suffering of your health\) and being able to speak in your mother tongue, which is the language of the territory you are living, is a right every government should grant to its citizens.

&gt;They ARE cutting rights to people who don't know the co\-official language.

Well, when you migrate to another country or region, you are expected to learn the language of that territory if you want to work as a doctor. If for some reason you hate the language that people speak that much that you don't want to learn it, probably you would be better living somewhere else.

&gt;Meanwhile the country's official language, the one speaked by 100&amp;#37; of  the population and which curiously is the 2nd or 3rd most important  language worldwide, is tried to be replaced by a freaking regional  language.

Can you quote that? I think nobody proposed that doctors should not speak Spanish \(like you are proposing for Catalan\). What the government suggests is that they should speak BOTH, because they are serving a bilingual population.

&gt;You can talk Catalan with anyone while  waiting at the hospital. Every sign and information is bilingual. Most  doctors and nurses speak it too. But requiring it for specialists? Are  we crazy or what??

Being a good doctor is not only learning long books during your university years. It's also about communicating with your patients and being able to offer them a good assistance.

4716,"&gt;Britain could seek €1.4bn refund as tempers flare over post-Brexit security access

Isn't that part of the settlement in the [divorce bill](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/24/uk-liable-for-divorce-bill-even-with-no-brexit-trade-deal-nao-chief)? It seems reasonable to get some sort of a refund though, if they are indeed booted out of the project.

&gt;“They’re playing hardball,” said one senior UK government official. “We’re looking at a range of options, but unless they back down, we will withdraw from Galileo. We are scoping the possibility of launching our own system.”

That seems a rather expensive adventure. I hope it will not affect the [£350 million a week](https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/10354) that Boris promised will go to the NHS.

&gt;“They’re playing hardball,” said one senior UK government official. “We’re looking at a range of options, but unless they back down, we will withdraw from Galileo. We are scoping the possibility of launching our own system.”
&gt;
&gt;David Davis, Brexit secretary, is also said by colleagues to be “furious” over the commission’s stance, while Olly Robbins, the UK’s Brexit negotiator, held frosty discussions with his counterparts in Brussels last week.

While I do agree that the UK and the EU should keep cooperating as close and as much as possible when it comes to security and defense, Galileo *is* an [EU project](http://ec.europa.eu/growth/sectors/space/galileo_en) and the UK chose to leave that same EU:

&gt;The Galileo programme is funded and owned by the EU.
&gt;
&gt;The European Commission has overall responsibility for the programme, managing and overseeing the implementation of all activities on behalf of the EU.

Sorry to say it, but leaving the EU means leaving EU projects. This is *exactly* what Brexit means and this is *exactly* what the UK voted for and what Brexiters wanted. The EU is not to blame, if they didn't see this coming.

But to be honest, I'm pretty sure things will work out fine regarding this subject:

&gt;“The EU cannot share security-relevant proprietary information with countries outside the EU,” Mr Barnier said. “But there are of course ways Galileo can co-operate with third countries and these are open to the UK as well.”",European Union,/r/europe/comments/8erkb4/uk_explores_producing_own_satellite_system_after/dxxk87s/,Leocto,1524641880

4845,"&gt;That’s a decrease in demand

I agree. If consumption rates lagged after supply restored to pre-prohibition levels, than demand must have decreased. But, that does not prove that demand decreased during Prohibition or because of Prohibition. 

Some economist think that prohibition increased demand because alcohol was seen as an illustrious good. Speakeasies were seen as alluring social get togethers. But, upon the repeal of prohibition, demand would decrease because alcohol is no longer seen as an illustrious good. Similar trends exist in the present day. Americans younger than 21 have higher demand for booze than legal drinking age Americans- the charm of crime increases the demand. 


----------------------------------------------
In regards to your citation, wikipedia. It notes that they are no definitive estimates of alcohol consumption during prohibition. Consumption data pre 18th amendment was based upon taxes. To quote the article, ""Scholars estimate that consumption dropped to a low of about 60% of pre-prohibition levels around 1925, rising to almost 80% before the law was officially repealed."" This statement does not align with your claim that consumption did not bounce back until the 40s.

4869,"&gt;don't blame others for faults if you have the same

If you're talking about anti-semitism with the conclusion that Christians and Muslims have the same faults, that's simply nonsense. In the Christian world anti-semitism is repulsed, in the Muslim world it is spread. In the Christian world the holocaust is taught and learned from, in the Muslim world it is blatantly denied. It's a gross misinterpretation and really a slap in the face to hundreds of years of Christian progress on the issue while Muslims have generally regressed on it. Note: these are generalizations of course, but reflect a large majority of both populations. May I remind they are the exception though, not the norm.

I ask you, before you make claims against the Bible, have you read any scholarly opinions on the subject matter, and not an atheist opinion only (as I assume you are), but also that of the opposition? I question your authority on the matter because of your lack of basic logic; you say it contains anti-semitism, but you forget half the Bible is the religious text of Judaism, Jesus was a Jew, Jews are God's chosen people, so do you claim the Bible openly rejects the people it was originally made for?

Christianity is most definitely the least repressive mainstream religion on the planet, and since you fail to give another example that refutes this claim, I assume you have no argument against it. It is the spawn of liberal democracy. And finally neither women or especially gay rights were values of the Enlightenment, but nonetheless Christian women led the way in suffrage and prohibition, fighting for the rights of ""all God's children"".",,/r/europe/comments/8ejbsg/german_muslim_leader_says_antisemitism_is_a_sin/dxxawr5/,kyleburr,1524627002

4976,"&gt; There are numerous interviews with refugees saying they want to go home now because Merkel promised them a big house and free money and it didn’t quite work out like that, and they came for that reason etc.

Merkel never promised them that. Evidence like that is anecdotal at best, in your case you haven't even provided said 'evidence'.

&gt; At the time you idiots were chanting ‘yes we can’ and ‘refugees welcome’ while clapping and cheering them arriving at train stations without even stopping to think of the consequences because you were too busy self congratulating yourselves and patting each other on the back about how you were no longer nazis.

Merkel didn't do that, she is right-wing Christian-Conservative, it's not her fault is some Leftists at the trainstations in Munich were a bit crazy.

&gt; This is all while calling anyone that dared point out this might not be a good idea a nazi and a bigot and threatening other EU countries that refused to take in refugees.

4978,"&gt;Ok, I am going to ask you, if I got this right. So the thing you are saying is that Armenia should stay in a status quo of perpetual corruption and never improve? 

If you reread it you will find that not only I don't write about Armenia should improve or not, I do not use words ""corruption"" and ""improve"" entirely.

My post is very simple. Armenia is and will be Russia-friendly no matter what just because Russia is the only one that can guarantee its survival. How to say it more clearly? Is it possible to be more brainwashed? I talk that Armenia is the main enemy of a bigger state, the state that wants genocide of all Armenians, genocide worser than Holocaust, because it will be not polite German ""Step into rows and march into shower"" but simply: taking a woman, open her belly, put a child inside, sew it, make you watch, then cut your throat.

That's the threat Armenia and every Armenian in it lives with every day. And now you come and start to tell me about how Russia attacked Crimea and Georgia and now probably Armenia.

It's what I wrote about. Blindness to everything, splitting the world into black and white, making simple syllogisms.

Eh, no? Why the hell on earth Russia and the US not acknowledging their own genocides but acknowledging another should irritate anyone denying this and that? It's simply pointing out the hypocrisy.

&gt; I'd have to say they aren't. The only ones still denied their homeland to this day like the Armenians are the Assyrians.

Wait, so Circassians aren't denied their homeland? Or Crimeans? 

The hell, Tasmanian are exterminated. Literally. Native peoples are also decimated to a point where they don't matter anymore with numbers and have no say in once their homelands. Eastern Coast of the US is free of those nations.

And higly possibly you don't know much about the American history, nor their exile, nor Caucasian history, nor the Australian.

&gt; . Id' have to rate the Natives below though because they were mostly killed by disease, not radical nationalists intentionally trying to commit genocide.

Yep, Trail of Tears and mass massacres on Natives were some dreams. /s

&gt; The Native Americans and Australian Aboriginals are pretty well known. No one neglects them.

Yep, that's why no one acknowledges those genocides...

&gt; As for the rest, no one talk about them because they aren't real genocides, and no one outside of Turks and Turkish-paid ""historians"" claim otherwise.

Which ones aren't mate? Circassian one was brutal than yours, as well as the Chechen-Ingush one. Heck, European Parlaiment acknowledged the later one. Crimean Tatar one was pretty much like yours, aka a mass exile. It's pretty disgusting that someone blabbers about a genocide but calling others, and even more brutal ones as fake, just because he has weird fantasies about Turkey forging up some fake genocides.

&gt; This makes no sense at all. The Armenian Genocide has been and still frequently is slighted so has not to offend trusty NATO ally Turkey.

Yes, this mentality is definitely sick and demented that some of you are glad and wish for Aliyev to continue his power because it benefits you. Your people have said very bizarre and outlandish things in the past, MakeWarNotDolma being a user who said our people are subhumans who have not been able to integrate within the region for the past 1000 years. I never hear any callback or criticism from Armenians when they make racial statements towards us. 

My post was not racist though, my post is calling out the racist and sick mentality that comes from this area which users participate in. Just a day ago, a large post shared to the international world displayed us as ""Sheep Lovers,"" as in people who bed with sheep and I replied in surprise and disgust, unbelievable how calling us Sheep Lovers is something deemed to be ok. By /r/Europe standards as well, where racism is abundant. 

&gt;Just for your information, there was a mini-session of awareness for the genocide today in my university, and I did have us discuss not just the Armenian one, but also the Bosnian, Circassian, Cambodian, and Greek genocides as well. Make of that what you will.

Then why have you been disagreeing and even creating an argument this entire time???????? This is exactly what I said should be done, Armenian rememberance day. many are focusing and bringing awareness to a genocide, there should be mentions of other ongoing genocides and how others are silenced as well as yours once was.

The antagonistic post I made was in regards to getting TUrks to recognize the Armenian genocide. I feel you are going to get nowhere at all if you guys continue burning their flags, burning products that have the name ""Turkish"" on it, or any of these sorts of gestures. In fact, it seems you guys are completely ok with being enemies with Turks and are not seeking recognition from Turkish people but recognition from other people in powerful countries. Are Armenians really interested in Turkish being recognizing it? Because it does not seem so at all. Are Armenians also interested in recognition from African countries like Zambia or is this just from countries with political power and a political thing in total? 

When Armenians burn the Turkish flag, it is interpreted as an attack on their nation. How would you feel if a Turk burned the Armenian flag? An attack on Armenia, right? This post is actually for Armenians, do you not think this is counterproductive thing to do on Armenian genocide rememberance day when you guys do this?

Either way, I am not convinced at all that Armenians are interested in reconciliation with Turks.

&gt;The German penchant for following rules is not just a cultural stereotype; as an export nation dependent upon the United States for its security, Germans care deeply about the rules-based liberal order, and their criticisms of Trump usually take the form of frustration and incomprehension at his flagrant disregard for its norms. **But Germans can afford to be sentimental about the liberal world order because they do so little to maintain it. If Germans love to speak of rules, the French better understand that enforcing them requires the power to do so**. “In the case of the France–U.S. relationship, cooperation has been promoted politically as a way to pursue common strategic interests rather than as the realization of a moral and normative bond,” write Alexandra de Hoop Scheffer and Martin Quencez of the German Marshall Fund of the United States. “As a result, French leaders have learned to be relatively comfortable working with U.S. presidents who were deeply unpopular in France.”

&gt;The pragmatic versus petulant approaches to dealing with Trump mirror the ways both countries responded to another American outrage: National Security Agency espionage conducted against their politicians and citizens. In 2015, when WikiLeaks, drawing on documents obtained from the fugitive NSA contractor Edward Snowden, revealed that the United States had spied on French presidents, the reaction in Paris was a collective shrug. The French understand that this is part of life for great powers — of which France is certainly one. **The French attitude toward Trump is not unlike their nonchalance at NSA spying: If Americans decide to elect a boorish television game show host as president, they will deal with him and not feel the need to whine and cry about it — and it’s not like the French themselves aren’t used to prima donna presidents.**",United States of America,/r/europe/comments/8embfb/american_donald_just_got_a_friendly_pat_on_the/dxwx08j/,ujorge,1524612522

First off your assumptions are hilarious and no surprise, coming from you. Second off, you completely ignored my analogies. Is it alright for me to go to someone else's funeral and bring about the death of someone completely unrelated, even if they may have died due to similar circumstances? Is it alright for me to change attention from the holocaust remembrance occasions, and instead switch to the Armenian genocide, or the Rwandan genocide, or etc.? No, that's extremely rude and is very basic human social etiquette that is drilled into people from a young age. You don't go about shouting off tangentially related things during a day/moment of solemnity just to spread awareness of a genocide when you can easily do so during the rest of the year as well. If you care so much about it, why don't you do so during other days? Why do you only try to bring up differing genocides that *do* need attention *only* when it's the Armenian one being mentioned? Knowing you, it's most likely because you want to divert attention from the Armenian genocide.

&gt; What makes one genocide more important than another genocide? There is no denying that Armenians politicize and base a huge part of their identity on this genocide. This has devalued the killings and tragedies of other people. What gets me angry is not the genocide of the Armenian people, but the supposed genocide of the Greek people where Greeks were responsible for mass ethnic cleansings and deportation of Turks yet one is recognized to be a genocide and another is not

What makes one massacre more important than another massacre? There is no denying that Azeris politicize and base a huge part of their identity on this Khojaly massacre. This has devalued the killings and tragedies of other people. What gets me angry is not the massacre of the Azeri people, but the actual genocide of the Turkish people where the Turks were responsible for mass ethnic cleansing and genocide of Armenians, yet not everyone can recognize it as the genocide that it genuinely is.

&gt; When should it be discussed? Please give a single example as to when any of these other genocides were ever discussed on any other day.

News sites, forums, articles, dedicated discussion centers, UN council rooms, university activity centers, TV, Radio, online, in public.

&gt; ARMENIAN GENOCIDE IS A THING OF THE PAST, DO YOU UNDERSTAND? There is actually a people being butchered, ethncally cleansed and exiled from their homes with nowhere else to go THIS VERY DAY. Do you want a MONOPOLY and to constrict all attention toward an event in the past which is almost 50 years older than the Jewish holocaust or do you also want to mention to the world that THERE ARE OTHER genocides occuring?

First off, child yourself good god, you're acting like a child and it's honestly genuinely embarrassing. There is actually a people being constantly affected by the genocide, ethnically cleansed and exiled from lands that used to be historically theirs for over millennia, scattered as they are to the four corners of the Earth to THIS VERY DAY. Do you want to DIVERT and to constrict all attention to the genocide just because you hate my people and don't want to see us prosper? You talk about seeing the Caucasus thrive and get together, then you go ahead and do this. Shame, shame.

&gt; Selfish, selfish, selfish, selfish. I honestly believe that Armenians want a monopoly on the genocide term and want to keep attention on them and not to others. Ironic, considering Armenians often complained of Jews for doing this when many Jews always warn of repeated history and how the world is not doing enough on their day of remembrance.

Coincidentally, that's what other holocaust deniers say against the Jews in an effort to undermine their cause. I honestly believe that Azeris and Turks just want to see Armenia fall and fail to prosper just so they may have the joy of seeing us suffer. I'd say it's surprising, but I'm not surprised anymore. Sometimes you talk sense, and i appreciate your words, and other times you act like a triggered nationalist who wants to see my people and I fall just because we were born to this ethnicity. I would suggest you look into the mirror and re-evaluate yourself, but I fear that you're a lost cause. Shame. I've met other Azeri people who are more rational and objective than you, however, so I won't waste anymore time with you. Have a nice day.

Relativization:

Armenian Genocide:

- More Muslims than Armenians died during the war, hence the Muslim population suffered more.

- Redistributing and inverting roles: Armenians were the perpetrators, Muslims were victims.

- Chronological confusion: the Turkey of today cannot be held responsible for what happened in 1915, but the actions of present-day Armenia explain and excuse the past treatment of Armenians.

The Holocaust:

- Germans and Austrians suffered most during the war due to Allied bombings.

- Redistributing and inverting roles: Jews planned to exterminate Germans; Germans were the true victims of genocide.

5120,"Uh, no, they're not. There's nuance in the word choices, and even your very-cherry-picked choices still show the distinction behind them.

Wikipedia:

&gt; Academic discourse considers both genocide and ethnic cleansing to exist in a spectrum of assaults on nations or religio-ethnic groups

A spectrum does not mean that they're the same thing. It means they're on a varying level of severity, with genocide being more severe and carrying a hefty legal baggage than ethnic cleansing.

Knowledgenuts:

&gt; The line between the two is often horrifyingly unclear, although the UN recognizes them as two separate crimes.

The UN recognizes a distinction exists between the two. it's not 'lItErAlLy GeNoCiDe' because if it was, that would be the term that would be used. No, there's a difference, a legal and social and political and physical one, and both of the terms used are meant to showcase that distinction. It's the same way when you say that you're 'hungry' and when you're 'famished'. Both mean the same basic thing, but the severity of each is vastly different, as can be seen. The example bellies the heaviness of the topic of discussion, but it gets my point across.

PBS:

&gt; Ethnic cleansing has not been defined and is not recognized as a crime under international law, according to the U.N. And in reality, the lines between ethnic cleansing and genocide are often blurred.

True, given only that, it shows a very clear similarity between the two, but allow me to show you the rest of the messages in the article:

In the case of genocide:

&gt; The treaty outlines five acts that can constitute genocide if they are done “with the intent to destroy an ethnic, national, racial or religious group”:

&gt;1. Killing members of the group

&gt;2. Causing serious bodily or mental harm

&gt; 3. Deliberately inflicting conditions of life calculated to bring about the group’s physical destruction in whole or in part

&gt; 4. Imposing measures intended to prevent births

&gt; 5. Forcibly transferring children

Whereas ethnic cleansing is described as simply:

&gt; Ethnic cleansing, on the other hand, only refers to the expulsion of a group from a certain area

Again, very clearly defined context and nuance, context and nuance that was built further upon within recent legal times, as stated by /u/Idontknowmuch in his prior comments.

Borgen:

&gt; Ethnic cleansing is considered a crime against humanity. It has not been written and signed in any U.N. treaty, which means Member States do not have to protect those who have fallen victim.

Same point as stated above, along with the other sources backing the distinction between the two terms.

&gt; Yes, those are literally all genocides. That is what the law says, but then the international community realized that it happened way too often to be able to deal with consistently so they made up case law called ""'ethnic cleansing"" to avoid having to deal with it. 

No, they're not genocides. The Azeri army did not intend to destroy and kill the entirety of the Armenian race within that region, it was ethnic cleansing and a massacre built within the context of the war. A genocide involves the total extermination of an whole race, and that was not displayed by the Azeris, bloodthirsty as they may have been in the war.

&gt; Dude, you can disagree with me on whether its fair to equivocate, but LITERALLY EVERYTHING YOU JUST POSTED SUPPORTS MY ARGUMENT.

Just pointed out that it doesn't so...

&gt; If you are going to say I am wrong, it MIGHT be a good idea not to just cite sources for me.

You're right.

Still, it's close.

&gt;It was about orphans, and that was a crime, while it wasn't about beating all Armenians into Turkishness.

You should (even though you won't, nor really deserve to) read Goodbye, Antoura by Karnig Panian. Armenian orphans were indeed subject to essentially identical orphanages that were meant to turn them into Turks, like how Native Americans children were taught to be more western.

A main goal of the genocide was largely about killing any Armenian that wouldn't convert to Islam and essentially become Turkish.

It was certainly not of Christendom, particularly the former. The enlightenment led our ancestors away from it as a world view in little more than a century before it died a death, in Europe at least, in the two wars.

As I said below it took none to long to go from reformation &amp; renaissance, to enlightenment &amp; liberalism, to secularism &amp; humanism.

Either way, pretty sure that both put paid to most being 'Christian' in a way that anyone from the 15th century would have recognised by the middle of the 20th. Yes, people we're empowered initially by understanding what the bible actually said over what they'd been told, but things moved pretty rapidly away from it after that once they'd learned to question it.

Hardly. Christianity didn't invent those morals (and in fact, many of Christianity's morals run directly counter to what we consider to be moral behavior). They predate Christianity; or indeed, any religion.

No. Our various languages either predate the christianization of our various countries, or evolved from pre-christian languages. Not a single of our languages is based on Christianity.

Could you imagine that Orban had to fashion a new law in 2010 that finally allowed citizens to defend themselves?

5235,"&gt;No, my point is that these parties sought to actively undermine the more liberal and pro reconciliation elements within Turkey so they could further their goals towards independence. They risked genocide for their own political goals. That in no way justifies the consequences, but it is still morally wrong.

If the Ottomans wanted Armenians to have a more favorable opinion of the government, then they shouldn't have created paramilitary groups for the sole purpose of massacring Armenians like a sport for the past several decades. You turks always like to forget that the Ottomans tried to go ahead and annihilate the entire Armenian race in 1890s too, and even though they got farther than they did with the Bulgarians, there was still no world war going on to occupy the great power's attention.

But for sure it's entirely the Armenian's fault that the government wanted to annihilate them. Genocide clearly justifies further genocide.

\&gt;I am not saying that they are responsible,  but they certainly didnt work to help reinforce the liberal regime that  could have easily won the 1912 election if it was free and fair.

What the fuck are you spouting now? Every non\-Turk supported the liberal regime \(before it betrayed the Christian ones\).

\&gt;The Young Turks were a mix of islamists,  ottomanism, and Turanists. When the Ottomanists were forced out, they  formed their own party and were set to win the 1912 elections until they  were rigged. They then took power in a coup and would have likely  maintained that power until the Balkan Wars undermined the legitimacy  and the racists took back power.

You mean the same ones that massacred the Armenians in Adana in 1909? Why should the Balkan countries practicing their right for independence and self\-determination mean the Armenian race has to be eliminated? If you could justify this, then you shouldn't have every problem with the Russians killing every single Circassian \(which they didn't anyway\).

\&gt;Ah yes, Louise Nalbandian never said ""Both  organizations were committed to armed struggle to achieve their goals  and accepted the use of terror” and most genocide scholars totally dont  accept that the Armenians participated in the slaughter of Muslims in  Eastern Anatolia.

I searched this quote and it seems to actually come from a book by Guenter Lewy, an infamous genocide denier, and he doesn't cite where this Nalbandian quote supposedly comes from.

\&gt;TIL that the Turkish population of Bulgaria never decreased from 35\-40&amp;#37; to 8&amp;#37;

Cool McCarthy stats.

\&gt;The ottomans committed genocide there, FYI

Well I'm glad you agree. Hard to really expect the Bulgarians to want to keep the Turks around after all the crimes they committed and yet they still have a large Turkish minority that they even let form their own political parties \(the sole reason Bulgaria hasn't recognized the Armenian Genocide\). Meanwhile if you kill an Armenian in Turkey, the Turkish police will throw you a party.

\&gt;Lol, never said that.

You said the Armenians ""risked genocide"" by daring to voice their own interests in a government that already tried to wipe them out before.

5241,"&gt; What has Macron to say about the Saudis who finance wahhabism in Europe, or the US? 

The US doesn't have any interest what so ever in destabilising us. We are one of their biggest markets, and vice versa. We can talk about Islamic terrorism, when it's an actual threat to our societies, and not just a sporadic tragedy. 

&gt; They destroyed Irak, Lybia, and are working in Syria these days, so they can sell weapons and steal oil

Sources please. Libya and Syria are active war zones, not really prime locations for resource extraction. 

&gt; is that better than occupying South Ossetia? 

Yeah, since we sure as shit started neither of the civil wars that are happening now, while the occupations Russia do, are done in order to prevent countries, that have historically been oppressed by Russia from joining NATO.

&gt;To be clear, I do NOT sympathise with Putin at all.

Then stop acting like the textbook example of a useful idiot. 

&gt; But this campaign against Russia has a commercial interest behind (Nordstream) since the US wants to sell their gaz in Europe and they don't want the pipelines that will connect Russia and Europe.

This campaign has the interest of letting f.x. the Baltic countries decide their own fate in this world, which they've explicitly told the world the last 100 years, is to not be subjugated by Russia.

&gt;I doubt it is in our best interest that we help the US to make us fully dependent on them for the gaz.

And pray tell me, how exactly would the US sell gas in a meaningful scale to Europe? There's no pipeline between Europe and the US. 

Also, Russia has several times used closing valve on their already existing gas pipelines to Ukraine as a political leverage. Relying on Russian gas is in no way in our best interest. Our best interests is to move past it.


&gt;And regarding the danger, isn't NATO also doing military demonstrations in the Baltic? Aren't they doing the same?

Fuck no. When was the last time we [simulated nuclear strikes on Russian soil?](https://www.vice.com/da/article/dpwk4q/why-is-russian-military-hanging-out-on-swedish-territory)(Be aware this is a nuclear strike simulation on a neutral country) Or simulated [a strategic bombing of a political summit?](https://www.thelocal.dk/20141031/russia-simulated-a-military-attack-on-denmark)

When it comes to troops stationed in the area, Russia far outnumbers the NATO forces. The NATO forces are there to act as a safety for the Baltic countries, not as an invasion force(there's like 7000 foreign NATO soldiers stationed in the Baltics and Poland). 

&gt;Maybe I'm wrong, but, could be an option for Europe to start some kind of dialogue instead of closing the communication lines? We are 500 Millions against 140M, and there are nuclear weapons in both sides, which side you think is more powerful?

We tried that. It's obvious Putin has neo-imperial ambitions with Russia, and therefore it won't get off the ground.

Obviously internal politics have to favour this as you said. It cannot be forced. There is a saying that only a truly democratic Turkey will recognise the genocide. And I firmly believe this. The genocide issue should be seen and used as a means to achieve true democracy and not as a means to repress democracy which unfortunately is what is being done.

Because saying ""fuck your retarded warmongering"" isn't an option most of the time.

&gt;£Tell me about how we're slaughtering people for all this nonexistent Afghan oil.


North of Afghanistan are countries with rich oil fields - specifically Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.   South of Afghanistan is Pakistan, and then the Arabian Sea.  Many oil companies, most prominently BP, want to build an oil pipeline that runs through Afghanistan (and then Pakistan) to the sea, but are unwilling to do so because they believe that the pipeline would be constantly attacked, especially by the Taliban.  The terminus of the pipeline would be a facility where oil tanker ships would fill up.

But I suppose asking an American to do some Jesus forbid research, before defending warmongering would be too much.

""In my note-book I find this entry:

July 1. -- In the hospital yesterday, a word of thirteen syllables was successfully removed from a patient -- a North German from near Hamburg; but as most unfortunately the surgeons had opened him in the wrong place, under the impression that he contained a panorama, he died. The sad event has cast a gloom over the whole community.
    
That paragraph furnishes a text for a few remarks about one of the most curious and notable features of my subject -- the length of German words. Some German words are so long that they have a perspective. Observe these examples:
    
 - Freundschaftsbezeigungen.
 - Dilettantenaufdringlichkeiten.
 - Stadtverordnetenversammlungen.
     
These things are not words, they are alphabetical processions. And they are not rare; one can open a German newspaper at any time and see them marching majestically across the page -- and if he has any imagination he can see the banners and hear the music, too. They impart a martial thrill to the meekest subject. I take a great interest in these curiosities. Whenever I come across a good one, I stuff it and put it in my museum. In this way I have made quite a valuable collection. When I get duplicates, I exchange with other collectors, and thus increase the variety of my stock.""

Socialism is an economic system in which the means of production are owned and directly managed by the workers. It doesnt require ""other peoples money"" as thatcherites like to claim, infact, the whole fucking point of it is to get the value that YOU, as a worker, actually create, into your pocket.

Socialism has nothing to do with welfare. Welfare exists primary in capitalistic systems, but can appear in literally any political or economic system. Fuck, the Arab Caliphates had welfare, as did the ancient romans, and even the Egyptians to some extent (hell, the egyptians, despite being as far right as you can get, a dictatorial theocracy, had 100% of all land in the country owned directly by the monarch.

Think Russia or Turkey vs the West, there is a palatable tension there that has persisted for centuries, a distinct sense of ""otherness"" on each side.

And while divisions can exist within a civilization as you mentioned (Western Europeans have been killing each other for centuries as well) there is a much more pronounced sense of dehumanization and viciousness when two worlds collide. For example, when Catholics were at war with other Catholics or Orthodox Christians were at war with other Orthodox Christians they never made a point of maliciously demolishing each others churches, that wouldn't have even occurred to them since those places of worship were essentially just like the ones they'd worshiped in all their lives back home, there was a fundamental sense of cultural and religious familiarity that all sides shared. Yet as seen during the Yugoslav wars, Catholic churches, Orthodox churches and Islamic mosques were all deliberately targeted for destruction by ""the other side"", the absence of that sense of familiarity made such acts a lot easier to accomplish, the tribalist instinct is still hard-wired into humans and all it needs is a perceived sense of ""otherness"" to be triggered.

5572,"In the 1820s Mexico used to be around 3 times larger geographically. It included all the land from California to Texas. The problem was that Mexico had a small population which mostly lived in Southern Mexico. The Northern part of Mexico was mostly just inhabited by Indians.

Mexico was worried that the US was rapidly expanding westward so they invited all these Anglo-Americans and Europeans to settle in Texas. The idea was that they would populate Texas, assimilate to Mexican culture, and then they would prevent the US from wanting to take Texas. By 1835 Texas (an area twice the size of Germany) had 30,000 English speakers from the US and only 5,000 Mexicans.


Then in 1835 there was a military coup d’etat in Mexico. The new dictator got rid of the old federalist constitution and created a much more centralized government from Mexico City (1,000 miles away from Texas). That really pissed off Texas, so Texas revolted. The Mexican dictator invaded Texas and was defeated and captured by the Texas Army. Texas was an independent country from 1835-1845 before it negotiated to join the US (most of the population of Texas were Americans anyway).


So then Texas was part of the US, but Mexico never recognized the independence of Texas and there was a border dispute on where the border between Texas and Mexico was (it had never been defined). A few Americans were killed in the no-mans-land claimed by both countries and in 1845 the US declared war.


An American Army landed at Veracruz and marched to Mexico City. They occupied the capital and forced Mexico to “sell” all the land from California to Texas to the US.


The war was really controversial in the US at the time, but California was so awesome that even the anti-war people kinda went along with it. The Mexican army never won a battle.

5621,"&gt; A judge might think that those statements were offensive if general society also believed it to be, even though within the context it was factually correct?

No. 

The judge doesn't decide based on what they personally find offensive or what any other specific individual finds personally offensive. You, I and the British legal system all uniformly agree that outcomes would vary wildly if they were reliant on entirely subjective personal feelings of people effected.

Same reason the families of murder victims don't get to influence sentencing. Courts strive to be as fair, reasoned and predictable as possible.

'*Grossly offensive'* is tested through what's commonly known as [the man on the Clapham omnibus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_man_on_the_Clapham_omnibus), or the 'reasonable and prudent man' in Scots law.

&gt; So a cute pug being trained to raise its paw on command, a command that is as a result of an u usual out of ordinary and out of character, within the context of a joke... is a joke.

To be absolutely clear, the salute *was not the issue*. It was excessive repetition of ""*gas the jews*"" being uploaded publicly to the internet, he promoted it once it went a little viral, he made absolutely no effort to restrict access to it despite his defense in court being reliant on ""*it was only for friends*"".

Again, it's **not** illegal to hold opinions or say the whole video verbatim, neither seriously or as a joke. It's not illegal to offend or insult a person. 

You can even share yourself doing it online. You just have to make *some* effort in recognition that you have a legal responsibility - in the UK - to consider your potential audience. You can't upload a video wherein you repeat ""*gas the jews*"" ~20 times and have it never occur to you that maybe this could be an issue if just anyone has access to it.

&gt; In my opinion you shouldn’t be able to apply criminal activity to office and how someone else feels as a result of ideas or language.

As I've tried to explain, he was not convicted of offending anyone.

The literal crime is sharing a digital file that a judge *later* deems grossly offensive. **Anyone** uploading that video publicly, in full, is technically guilty of the same crime. Not discussing it, not quoting it, not doing a similar bit with better editing. It's the content of the video in question being shared in the method it was.

Had the content been different, had it been shared differently, he would have never been charged.

That's not to say the law as it stands is fit for purpose.

Their new law would forbid any native minory language usage (Polish, Hungarian, Romanian, Russian) for education after the first 4 years, meaning you cannot learn about history, math, biology ect using your nativel anguage only Ukranian, while a very minimal course stays for native education. This completly kills of any organic growth of native language in few decades leading to huge assimilation pressufe of minorities, the scientific literature is clear on this.

Compare this to the Hungarian law, where until university level native education is not only allowed, but supported by the goverment and extra funding is allowed from Slovakia and private groups. Many of these schools are actually higher status because the better funding than the native Hungarian ones.

Also Slovakian minority due to the brilliant ""exchange"" programs of Benes are mostly dispersesd in the coutry with few cities being an outlier, while Hungarian minority forms an ethnic core with in most places 80%+ majority.

As I reluctantly start to walk away toward the airport, he tells me to hold on and hands me my phone that had fallen out of my pocket and between the seats.  Even though most Romanians I've met have been perfectly nice and helpful, I felt bad for automatically assuming the guy was dishonest.

On the other hand, I once made the mistake of asking a friendly Romanian taxi driver if he took Euro because I didn't have any leu on me.  He charged me 15 euro for a 10km trip, which I thought was very fair as someone used to western European rates.

The one that isn't is the Cohesion Fund, which is only available to members with a GNI of less than 90% of the EU average.

In the current budget period the Cohesion Fund is worth 63.4 billion Euro so 18% of the 351.9 billion for all ESI funds. 


The funds are a bit complicated. Regions that are below 75% of average GDP are counted as ""less developed regions"", and they are eligible for more funding than transition regions (75-90%), which receive more than more developed regions (90+% of average GDP). 

But you can totally have less developed regions while not having access to the cohesion funds. That's probably what those politicians were hinting at. Spain (Extremadura is less developed), France (Guadeloupe, Martinique, Guyane, Réunion, Mayotte), Italy (Campania, Puglia, Basilicata, Calabria, Sicilia) and the UK (Cornwall and Isles of Scilly, West Wales and The Valleys) are currently countries that don't have access to the CF but have less developed regions.

Also is a choice not a given.

Meaning that not all hungarians choose to learn in hungarian or not all universities have all subjects in hungarian.

The point is people feel like they have a choice so they have no problem choosing to study in romanian because they see it as an oportunity not as an obligation forced down their throat.

Why we chose this path?

Because for instance even to this day there are stories people say about how during Ceaușescu (commie times) which was probably the most opressive regime in Romania's history the army service was 1 year mandatory and the funniest thing was trying to teach romanian to the 2-3 hungarians in each platoon.

That is confirmed by many. Hungarians would learn romanian in the army (so their 20's) even during the most opressive and centralistic regime in the country's history.

Marxist? The ""open society"" was described by Sir Karl R. Popper in 1945 as a strong **opposition to marxism** as well as any sort of extremist and radical rule in general namely national socialism, as well. The open society is literally the exact opposite of marxism, because it aims to create freedom and equal rights not based on ideology, but on separation of power, intellectual exchange, civil rights and laizism. It's part of the essence of modern Western societies, where you're not judged by who you are, but by what you do. It's what you have the pleasure to live in, my friend.

But apparently you seem to have issues with that, because you lack respect for law as well as rights. Considering that you were quick to associate me with marxism, I'd reckon that you come right from the other despicable extreme of the political spectrum, i.e. national socialism.

5718,"In Latvia you can teach up to 40% of the curricula in minority languages like Russian. This is not oppression, it's an insane watering down of the word oppression to call it that. The problem is  many russians have this hilarious delusion that they are culturally superior to their neighbours, and so any brutal colonization efforts on them are for their own good, and for them to have to learn the language of the country they have lived in for easily 40-50 years half fluently as a second language hurts their pride and results in claims of oppression.

&gt;So did they immigrate on their own accord, or did a totalitarian planned economy move them there regardless of their opinion?

Initially it might well have been against their will for some, however today they hold positive views of the soviets and the don't give a shit about the horrors they inflicted on the baltics. But what matters is they are living nice and confortably in the baltics compared to 95% of places they would live in Russia, and that is why despite the nazi latvian regime they would not leave in a hundred years.

&gt;So must all Turks be evicted from Bulgaria by force because they're remnants of a colonizations by a regime that was not forcibly herding them wherever The Dictator chose to?

I didn't say they should deport the russians, I just said they should consider themselves lucky they are allowed to stay even though they completely shit on soviet oppression in the baltics and extremely basic things to be expected like fluency in the local language.

However many of them came before the ottomans from the north through ukraine and dobruja, including the namesake of bulgarians, the bulgars, so you'll have to completely rewrite bulgarian history to make this logical.

but i answered the question ""If you go by the racial standards of the internet"" 

And compared to this whole ""aryan god/goddess"" stuff, south germans are darker skinned (its hotter), smaller height wise (on average in my experience, cant find any data, mountains kinda do that) and there are a LOT of Italians and Greeks mixed in (not saying the north doesnt have as many immigrants, but the Greeks and Italians are more integrated than say, Turkish people, and therefore more likely to join your family via marriage, also they are closer to the south and therefore are here in larger volumes)

If you are going off of culture, then for sure, i agree 100% that you would say that south germany is the ""real germany"".

The old anglo idea of germans used to come from hessen/ westfallen, because there are a lot of brits stationed there, but back in the day it used to belong to the queen (westphallia), there are plenty of germans in Newcastle, i dont know maybe its just that back when you learned about all this shit as a kid there where different ideas about who acts like what.

What we need to ask ourselves is why we are so opposed to the idea of accepting the label. There are many factors that play into the unwillingness to acknowledge the genocide; I've seen a few well-written articles on this, though I don't think I'll be able to find them right now. The politicization of the genocide by the ""other"" side and fears of having to pay reparations do play into it to an extent, though I believe ultimately the fault falls on our side.

5927,"&gt;In 2017, 6.7% of the population or around 33 million people in the European Union (EU) were severely materially deprived. 

&gt;This means that they cannot afford at least four of the following items, which are considered by most people to be desirable or necessary to lead an adequate life:

&gt;* pay their bills on time;

&gt;* keep their home adequately warm;

&gt;* face unexpected expenses;

&gt;* eat meat (or fish or the vegetarian equivalent) regularly;

&gt;* take a one week holiday away from home; a TV;

&gt;* a washing machine;

&gt;* a car;

&gt;* a telephone;

&gt;Across EU Member States, Bulgaria (30.0%), Greece (21.1%), Romania (19.4%) and Hungary (14.5%) register the highest shares of severe material deprivation. In contrast, the severe material deprivation rates were below 3% in Sweden (0.8% in 2016), Luxembourg (1.6% in 2016), Finland (2.0%) and the Netherlands (2.6%).

&gt;In most of the countries for which 2017 data are available, the severe material deprivation rate decreased compared with 2016. The exceptions are Denmark, where it increased by 0.5 percentage points, from 2.6% in 2016 to 3.1% in 2017, and the Netherlands where it remained stable at 2.6%. The largest decreases are registered in Romania (from 23.8% in 2016 to 19.4% in 2017, or -4.4pp), followed by Italy (from 12.1% to 9.2%, or -2.9pp), Croatia (from 12.5% to 10.3%, or -2.2pp), Bulgaria (from 31.9% to 30.0%, or -1.9pp) and Cyprus (from 13.6% to 11.7%, or -1.9pp).",Bucharest,/r/europe/comments/8eiorl/share_of_severely_materially_deprived_people_down/dxvhu18/,B0etius,1524555719

The upper house only has revising powers and is limited to sending legislation back to the Commons for them to think over it again.  So the Lords cannot prevent legislation from passing.  That said, there is a degree of moral authority that comes with bouncing a bill back to the Commons that means MPs are more likely to break ranks and vote their conscience rather than the party line in such circumstances.  Also, while it is true that the Parliament Acts allow the Commons to force through bills in the face of opposition in the Lords, that is seen as a nuclear option that is only to be used in extreme cases.  So it is not a given that votes in the Lords will just be ignored since it is hard to motivate the Commons to use the Parliament Acts on controversial issues.",,/r/europe/comments/8eewrf/theresa_may_suffers_third_brexit_defeat_in_lords/dxvhwl8/,Cryptoalt7,1524555882

How many millions did Netherland lose in WWII? Every country prepares for the last war. US and GB during Cold war were truing to get ready for new Battle for Atlantic. USSR was paranoid about invasion from the West.

I mean, last time Russia wasn't ready to fend off the agression the repercussions were apocalyptic. The fear of another foreign power slaughtering civilians left and right is so deeply engrained in Russian social consciousness, that even the elite, which is supposed to be more informed, tends to overreact.

5960,"&gt;If anything, Portugal is Galician, and not Galiza is Portuguese.

Neither is correct,regardless of your personal opinion in this matter.What I do know is that there is a movement in galicia called [reintegracionismo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reintegrationism).

There's alot of sides in this movement tho.

&gt;The **isolationist** considers Galician and Portuguese to be two distinct languages, although they are closely related. Isolationists favour differentiated rules of writing and spelling between Galician and Portuguese. In this fashion, Galician spelling follows the model of Spanish orthography and its own traditional conventions, which converge with it in some aspects. This view is held by the majority of public and Government organizations. Its standard norm, the ""NOMIGa"", is elaborated by the Real Academia Galega (Royal Galician Academy) and the Instituto da Língua Galega (Institute for Galician Language).
Among other criteria, isolationism argues that since the majority of the Galician population was educated in Spanish only (as official use of Galician was forbidden for centuries[citation needed], especially during Franco's dictatorship), it is easier to create a Galician written norm which is closer to Spanish, therefore more ""familiar"", regardless of other considerations. It is also alleged that since the Spanish language had such a vast influence in modern Galician its contribution should not be simply disregarded. This influence is noticeable in some aspects of Galician phonetics and colloquial speech.




&gt;The **reintegrationist** view considers Galician to be a variant of a shared Galician-Portuguese linguistic diasystem, as evidenced by the common origin, grammar, syntax, vocabulary, morphology and overall high level of mutual intelligibility. Therefore, reintegrationists support the use of spelling rules similar to the ones used in Portuguese-speaking countries. This is supported by the AGAL (Galician Association of the Language), Galician Academy of the Portuguese Language, Brazilian Academy of Letters, Sciences Academy of Lisbon, and a number of civic and cultural associations both in Galicia and Portuguese-speaking countries.
In this fashion, it is argued that Galician would be faithful to its history and etymology and subsequently its written norm would be more scientific and precise. Thus, it would allow Galician speakers to have direct access to a world culture and it would also clarify some spelling problems of the isolationist norm (for example in terms of accentuation).
&gt;Reintegrationism is a cultural stand as much as a linguistic position. Its supporters believe that Galicia rightfully belongs to Lusophony since, in fact, modern Portuguese originated in what is today Galicia (see History of Portuguese, Galician-Portuguese period). They aim for stronger cultural and economic ties with the Portuguese-speaking countries using the common language as a tool for direct communication.
