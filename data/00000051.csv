In the UK there are small areas of public land called ""commons"", these are (almost always) remains of the common land that was left over when the land was fenced and stolen.

The new forest for instance was a private hunting ground for the royalty, it's soil is terriable for farming which is one of the reasons it wasn't turned to agricultural as well.

110,"I read that some king declared that traffic was to travel on the left while going across London Bridge, and it spread from there, when it comes to Britain and Ireland. The bridge was basically an extension of the city, with up to 200 houses built on it. Congestion was severe enough that crossing it could take over an hour. The traffic law came into effect in the 18th century, and was incorporated into the Highway Act of 1835 and implemented throughout British territories.

Roman soldiers did always march on the left, and there is some evidence wagons and carts were drawn on the left also. The Pope in 1300AD declared that all pilgrims travelling to Rome should keep to the left. Keep-to-the-right began in the late 1700s when much larger wagons, pulled by a train of horses, became popular for transporting larger quantities of goods. The driver sat at the back left of the train so that he could reach all of the horses with his whipping hand. Being at the back left made seeing oncoming traffic harder when travelling on the left. These wagons were most popular in North America, due to its size, and the first keep-to-the-right law was passed in Pennsylvania in 1792. France decreed the same in the same year, and Napolean later enforced it across French territories. Britain, being relatively small, had less need for wagons of that size, and so did not need to make an adjustment.

35% of countries in the present drive on the left, most of which are islands. There is an argument that it is safer because most people are right eye dominant, and that when changing gears in a car designed for right lane driving the hand left on the wheel is the typically weaker left hand. Countries that drive on the left tend to have considerably fewer traffic accidents and fatalities than those that drive on the right.",,/r/europe/comments/kc4fl5/driving_side_of_countries_of_europe/gfny2e5/,valdamjong,1607847199

Up until WWI there was no prevalent side in mainland Europe, since the amount of car traffic was small.

177,"&gt;But saying that far-right terrorism is a bigger threat to our freedoms than islamic terrorism, is just straight up bullshit.

Islamist terrorism *is* far-right terrorism. There's two types of far-right terrorism that currently pose a problem to Europe: white nationalist far-right terrorism and islamist far-right terrorism.

&gt;But the fact is that the islamic terrorists belong to a population group that is at max 10%, while the far-right terrorists belong to the 90%.

That is indeed a fact, but not a very useful or relevant fact. Remember, our goal is to stop terror attacks, not to incriminate a group of people. It's also a fact that almost all terrorists are men, just like almost all rapists, murderers and violent criminals are men. They're slightly less than 50% of the population and responsible for like 99% of the terrorism and 75% of the violent crimes. Sounds to me like it would be a lot effective to put all men under constant surveillance and treat them as second class citizens than to do this with all Muslims, including women. A white atheist man is obviously far far more likely to commit a terror attack than a fundamentalist Muslim women. It's just statistics and facts.

All of that is of course bullshit, scapegoat hunts don't stop terror attacks. 

&gt;Once again, they should both be dealt with

354,"&gt;Well, the thing about uniform dress code is that it's supposed to promote the idea of equality. 

No it promotes conformity.

&gt;If schools allowed students to wear whatever they wished, all the rich kids would wear nice, fashionable clothes while poorer kids would have to wear the plain ones that their parents could afford.


People love this argument but it's bullshit, we don't live in a classless society and depending on the job, which would be most jobs, you can wear whatever you want as long as you're reasonable, so what's the point of enforcing that standard in schools when the rest of their lifes it would be largely without uniforms.

It sets them up for a world that doesn't exist.

And if you're gonna start arguing that maybe the rest of society should be like that as well, I'm gonna shut you down right now, cause people have the right to dress and express themselves through they clothing however they want.

Kids should be allowed to express themselves through their clothing, and start teaching kids to be less judgmental, instead of enforcing uniformity, which is:

1. Authoritarian

2. Stifles individualism and uniqueness

Not every Kurd who refers to his city by it's Kurdish name is a PKK supporter, it's perfectly normal to use the Kurdish names when speaking Kurdish. Dersim specifically has quite a history and a meaning though, and thay combined with this guy's profile and comment makes it pretty clear where his affiliations lie.

&gt; It's getting closer and closer and autonomy is only the first step, don't worry, no one will miss Turks like you when Kurdistan is established in Eastern turkey.

How is it getting closer? Kurds can not break away from war-torn devastated Iraq and Syria, how they will break away from Turkey?

&gt; Btw your crying about ""bUt mUh tAxEs, DiRty K√ºRdS dOnT pAy fOr mIlitArY eQuIpMeNt"" made me happy.

A normal society functions in a way that everybody chimes in the money that's later used to build, maintain or improve infrastructure, provide public education and healthcare, etc.

When a portion of society does not do that, yet continues to receive these things it means that it lives off the backs of honest taxpayers. If Kurds are so keen on boycotting Turkey surely they can do that by not sending their children to schools, not using public transportation, not driving on public roads, not going to public hospitals and so on and so forth. They will do that though, they just don't pay for any of it and wonder how come everyone around them dislikes them so much.",Turkey,/r/europe/comments/k939ee/a_road_sign_when_crossing_from_georgia_to_turkey/gfm3a63/,Old_Cheesecake,1607818332

517,"&gt;We‚Äôre nowhere near equal GDP

20.8$ T nominal 2020 estimated US. EU: 19.23$T nominal 2019 (couldn't find 2020). So within 5% as stated.

EU is poorer on average, due to eastern economies that are quickly catching up. Now consider western European countries in the EU. Our western economies have GDP per capita that is quite close to US (albeit lower except for e.g. Luxembourg). Add the fact that we (in western Europe to be clear) have health insurance and a lot of other advantages, and you get a population that e.g. lives longer than the US, and arguably has higher living standards. Less wealthy (a bit on paper), but no student debt, no anxiety over paying medical bills, lives longer...

&gt;Barely a union and France is your only military power left.

True, we are lagging in military terms, but at the same time power is not only military. Barely a union: also true, but improving. It could be worse however, we could be a set of states suing each other because we don't agree with the result of a federal election. Also think soft power: much of that vanished under Trump.

549,"&gt; UKs GDP growth has been better than Italy, France and Germany almost every year of the last decade. 

Slightly better if you look at the numbers. Worse now.

&gt; Europe‚Äôs population demographics are awful that‚Äôs the main reason for low growth and since Europe‚Äôs population is projected to peak next year so that‚Äôll probably continue to get worse. 

Varies across European countries. France has decent pop growth, Italy abysmal. Low growth can be explained by a lot of other factors to, not only population growth (otherwise France would have high growth and Germany low).

&gt; UK trade with CPTPP would drastically increase if there was free trade which there isn‚Äôt. 

Yes, but again from a very low base. CETA increased EU trade with the EU 16% over 5 years. That's good, but not great. 

&gt; Pre-Brexit the EU held back Britain in almost everything, the British only ever wanted trade nothing else. 

Well not really right: now they've left and will be trading a lot left.

&gt; Obama tried to get a free trade deal with the EU the British were all for it, the rest of Europe knowing they couldn‚Äôt compete not so much. 

Not about competition, more about having different standards, especially in terms of agriculture/food.

&gt; As for us being some evil supervillain who preys on our trading partners that is laughably untrue. 

I did not say that. Contrary to what you seem to think I have a great deal of respect for the US. But let's be honest, look at the Trump presidency. Bullying EU steel imports, threatening and enforcing tariffs and banning exports from the EU. Threatening Korea for a better deal on military bases. Threatening Canada and Mexico into a new version of Nafta more beneficial to the US. Tariffs, tariffs, tariffs, the list goes on. I actually have little moral objection to that: all is fair in trade, but it would be nice to at least not claim to have any moral upper ground.

&gt; Are we the ones who forced Canada into regulation alignment?   
&gt;  
&gt;Have we preyed on Mexico? 

Yes, cf. us canada mexico trade agreement. 

&gt; You‚Äôre living in a fantasy. A trade deal is just that A TRADE DEAL, the EU has deluded you guys into thinking trade should be anything more than just business.

Now let's return to your initial point.

&gt; Before the WD this was the EUs position.    
&gt;  
&gt;However just before trade talks started his position suddenly changed to this. 

In the first case, the EU was saying: we can use the Canadian trade deal as the general level of free trade our future relationship can hold. This is before Johnson, and meant as code for a soft-Brexit. There was most likely the implicit assumption that there would be regulatory alignment. Then came Johnson, who removed the provisions that made such a deal interesting: no hard-borders.

602,"&gt; The UK is asking for a FTA along the lines of the one the EU has already signed with Canada, Mexico, South Korea and Japan. 

Yes, but the EU has likely no interest in such a deal: the UK is a potential competitor with a large trade volume with the EU, not the countries you have listed. The EU wants a deal that preserves EU interests.

&gt; None of the FTA signed by the EU in its history include the provisions it demanded of the UK because as we have seen no country would accept such an unfair agreement. 

Fairness is a non-concept in this context. There is no fair, there is only what each side is ready to accept. If the two positions are too far apart, as seems to be the case here, the result is no deal.

&gt;The EU is proposing that EU state aid laws apply to the UK and EU national governments but not the EU commission.  
&gt;  
&gt;So if the EU wants to gain an unfair advantage it can simply subsides EU members industry's at the EU level to bypass the rules.  
&gt;  
&gt;There is no similar mechanism which the UK would be permitted to use in order to similarly bypass state aid rules.

The EU Commission is not a state. All countries involved would be following the same rules. I this corresponds to positions that will likely not be palatable to the UK political class. At the same time, even more simply, the agreement can be ripped up in the future by any parties if such a situation occurs, or if they wish it.

&gt;It also wants the power to to unilaterally reinstate tariffs against the UK if its unhappy with its regulations going forward this would not require the EU to demonstrate that they causes any trade imbalance or unfair advantage and the UK would not have the ability to do the same in return.

The UK chose to let its regulations diverge from those of the EU. What UK politicians call sovereignty is a valid concern, but it's important to understand it comes at a cost. The idea of the UK making its own laws completely independently, yet competing on equal grounds with EU companies is a fiction. It has to chose one of the two.",France,/r/europe/comments/kb0c71/nodeal_brexit_is_now_likeliest_ursula_von_der/gflfgs3/,PhlegmaticMoose,1607811078

That is a very large number. It is somewhat comparable to the economic cost of covid, which has caused massive increases in unemployment over the world. That's also like erasing 4 years of growth. I fail to see why such a think would be negligible.

&gt; Plus if they join CPTPP and get a trade deal with us (both very likely) it‚Äôll be completely irrelevant. 

CPTPP: UK exports to CPTPP countries are low. 

US: UK trade with the US is somewhat high, but still much less than with the EU. In addition, the US fights for its own interests the same way the EU fights for theirs. I'm not sure how the UK would feel if a trade deal came with the condition of sacrificing its agriculture sector. The UK would be in a weaker position as well, given that the EU is at least trying to preserve something resembling the status quo (pre-Brexit, which was very positive for the UK). Given the predatory nature of US trade policy (under Trump in particular), I wonder if the UK would not end up trading a partnership of equals in order to become a vassal state to another country.",France,/r/europe/comments/kb0c71/nodeal_brexit_is_now_likeliest_ursula_von_der/gfli0ek/,PhlegmaticMoose,1607811973

764,"&gt;Education Scotland said on Wednesday night that it was ‚Äútaking steps to review the publication‚Äù to ‚Äúensure the facts are reflected accurately‚Äù and, after being contacted by The Daily Telegraph, deleted it from its website.

&gt;In the document, there are repeated references to Scots being mistreated by the English, including a debunked myth that Sir Winston Churchill ‚Äúdispatched English troops and tanks‚Äù to Glasgow in 1919 to quell unrest while locking up Scottish troops in barracks over fears they would ""precipitate a major revolution"".  It claims ‚Äúthousands of English troops remained in Scotland for many months‚Äù.

&gt;It also asserts ‚Äúa resentment of English domination‚Äù in the 18th Century and states ‚Äúhopes for an independent Scotland continued‚Äù after the 1707 Act of Union, even though there was no mainstream political movement for independence until the second half of the 20th Century.

&gt;The document includes 24 references to the SNP, the same number of mentions as Labour, the party that actually delivered the Scottish Parliament.

&gt;It includes a mention of the 1995 film Braveheart, stating that William Wallace had been an ‚Äúinspiration to Scottish nationalists‚Äù since his death in 1305, and a reference to a pro-SNP magazine. 

&gt;However, it is silent on Scotland‚Äôs major role in the British Empire or the slave trade which Sir Tom said there was a growing understanding of among historians.  

That is not education. That is a political campaign based on nationalistic lies.

786,"&gt;It was owned by Krupp, but had to operate under the laws of Nazi Germany

That is called capitalism, not planned economy.

&gt;Actually, I do.

But you don't mention that financial elites supported him.

&gt;No need to be hostile.

I wouldn't be if you wouldn't talk nonsense like:

&gt;The Nazis had a planned economy. The war was caused by Nazi-Soviet cooperation.

So...

&gt;As I said, one system being bad does not automatically mean that the other one is good.

But you for example say that WWII is the result of nazi-soviet cooperation, which is absolutely historically inaccurate.

That means that you don't know that fascism stated anti-communism as it's core feature, that pro-communistic USSR tried multiple times to organize anti-fascist coalition, but League of Nation (British and French empires) declined. While they also were not against german militarism (but only on eastern direction) which returned to them soon after Munich treaty.

&gt;But we were talking about communism, not fascism, and whataboutism is an ugly misdirection tactic.

We were talking about Bulgaria, and you've said ""i know what it was in Hungary and it was similar"". That is nonsense.

There is no whataboutism - if you want to call pro-communist regimes oppresive - let's see what was there before changing government?

Nazis and fascists, totalitarian xenophobes who invaded others.

If someone points on that - that's misdirection for you? Why?

&gt;Just as many, if not even more people died in gulags or were killed by the invading Soviets as died in concentration camps.

What proof of such statement have you seen?

Present it - because I call it absolute bullshit.

(Also, specialist in soviet camps must know that GULag (Glavnoe Upravlenie LAGerei) is the head department, there are no gulags by definition, that's penitentiary system based on previous for czar times).

So, let's see - what documents do you base your words on.

&gt;Also, the Nazi-Soviet cooperation was just the casus belli.

No, it wasn't. Before nazi-soviet non-agression treaty, Germany took Austria and Czechoslovakia, and German ally Japan attacked China. Let alone that war against Poland started 1st of september, and soviets stepped in war only 17th of september, to liberate western Ukraine and Belarus, which poles occupied in 1920s.

&gt;But capitalism having its flaws does not make communism good.

You blame communism that in crysis times of communism you had to stay in queue for some goods.

I blame capitalism for hundreds of wars including 2 World Wars.

&gt;The non-participation of the USSR in the partitioning of Czechoslovakia

Even more, USSR was the only one that declared intention to fullfill mutual defense obligations with Czechoslovakia. Meanwhile France refused to do it's part, because Poland refused it's part: didn't allow way to CZ and took important CZ region for themselves.

&gt;does not redeem its participation in the partitioning of Poland

Absolutely agree, these 2 events aren't connected.

Actions against Poland are the result of Pilsudski agression in 1920s, they violated Curzon line - we returned occupied lands.

Btw, plan Weiss was signed before Molotov-Ribbentrop, and in Plan Weiss itself USSR is mentioned 2 times - and both times as potential enemy.

Did you know that?

&gt;Why is capitalism oppressive?

Because it opresses people, as you've agreed 1 message above.

&gt;At least they don't shoot poor people

They do and very often: [Vietnam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M·ªπ_Lai_massacre), [Iraq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_War_documents_leak), even [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Cyclone) and its' consequences!

&gt;while communist regimes imprisoned and frequently killed wealthier people

That's whom and when and for what?

&gt;but what is the other option?

Socialism, there is no choice. Either we live to solve some strategical goals, or we fight for oil until we kill each other like dogs (and that's gonna happen in a matter of minutes, considering modern weapons). Or, of course, some transnational corporate dystopia defended by army/police.

&gt;Standing in line for bananas like it's the new iPhone?

What countries were allowed to import bananas in USSR - Vietnam and Cuba? :)

Is that a problem of isolation and blocked trading or of socialism itself? Did you have apples?

And what's more important - okay, now market globalized, you can buy iphone - but do you have enough money for iphone? Brazil had access to iphones and had capitalizm - but most popular phone in country was button nokia - that's it. Plus if queue for you is the problem and hours on work to get money isn't - that's strange.

&gt;Waiting decades to get a Trabant?

Yeah, ""decades"". And like you don't work ""decades"" nowadays for a car or flat. Like USA people aren't stuck in credit pits for same things for years.

And that's in the richest capitalistic country in the world, wow.

&gt;Economies crumbling under government debt

That's naive myth, economy that didn't crumble from WWII, can't crumble for relatively small debt.

&gt;Capitalism works, and communism didn't.

Just wait new war. Then another war and then another one.

There are no uninvolved places to take profits from, you have to understand that.

&gt;Instead of having few wealthy and many poor people, everyone was poor (except the party elite - but that's another story).

Nonsense, even in worst times there was no picture like in modern USA for example, where 10 people own wealth of 150 poorest millions.

790,"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skylon_(spacecraft)

Copied from Wikipedia:

Skylon is a series of designs for a single-stage-to-orbit spaceplane by the British company Reaction Engines Limited (REL), using SABRE, a combined-cycle, air-breathing rocket propulsion system. The vehicle design is for a hydrogen-fuelled aircraft that would take off from a purpose-built runway, and accelerate to Mach 5.4 at 26 kilometres (85,000 ft) altitude (compared to typical airliner's 9‚Äì13 kilometres or 30,000‚Äì40,000 feet) using the atmosphere's oxygen before switching the engines to use the internal liquid oxygen (LOX) supply to take it into orbit.[3] It could carry 17 tonnes (37,000 lb) of cargo to an equatorial low Earth orbit (LEO); up to 11 tonnes (24,000 lb) to the International Space Station, almost 45% more than the capacity of the European Space Agency's Automated Transfer Vehicle;[4] or 7.3 tonnes (16,000 lb) to Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit (GTO), over 24% more than SpaceX Falcon 9 launch vehicle in reusable mode (as of 2018[5][6]). The relatively light vehicle would then re-enter the atmosphere and land on a runway, being protected from the conditions of re-entry by a ceramic composite skin. When on the ground, it would undergo inspection and necessary maintenance, with a turnaround time of approximately two days, and be able to complete at least 200 orbital flights per vehicle.",,/r/europe/comments/kbw9jw/skylon_ssto_spaceplane/gfkwlh0/,cain325,1607804906

He came in a fairly tumultuous political time, with the right-wing party (Les R√©publicains) losing ground in the polls because their candidate was going through a lot of revelations relating to malpractice over public finances. At the same time the left was embattled by a crumbling of the socialist party (there are a lot of reasons for that: since the primary was open to votes from non-adherent of the party, militants from other parties flooded the process to vote for Hamon to oppose Manuel Valls, which caused a schism in the management of the party. Furthermore Hamon was ... not a great campaign leader, refusing to work with his former opponents in his party, which ended up with a lot of them jumping ship to Macron). 

He was in fact very lucky: Jean-Luc Melenchon of the far left party ¬´¬†France insoumise¬†¬ª was getting a lot of ground in the polls while Macron himself was losing voters. If the campaign had been two weeks longer, Macron would have come third in the first turn.

858,"&gt;So, Krupp steel wasn't owned by Krupp? :)

It was owned by Krupp, but had to operate under the laws of Nazi Germany. That meant following their economy plans and subordinating themselves to the war economy. It wasn't that difficult, given that the board was filled with party members. 

&gt;It's 2020 and you still don't understand how and why marginal party in Weimar Republic came to power? Who and why needed ""expansion on East""?

Actually, I do. People dissatisfied with the Treaty of Versailles, the victims of the 1923 and 1929 crises found someone who appealed to them. This sadly happened to be an extremist party that offered a solution to their problems (a bad one, though). 

&gt;Actually, why should you, if you would know this - it would be hard to organize it again.

&gt;maybe you need at least some basic level of competence before discussing such huge things?:)

No need to be hostile. 

&gt;The war was caused by Nazi-Soviet cooperation. 

&gt;War was caused by Versailles treaty and global crysis of capitalistic system.

&gt;By the way - was this caused by soviets - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_Agreement?

&gt;Or you say cooperation was crucial?

&gt;Oh, whole list of victims with their own fascist (and couple imperialist) regimes there, what a surprise. /s

&gt;You didn't know that? That's not studied in hungarian schools? Only ""occupation"" fairytales? While rewriting history and whitewashing of fascism?

I'm not trying to whitewash fascism. Fascists committed horrible crimes, in Hungary, too. As I said, one system being bad does not automatically mean that the other one is good. But we were talking about communism, not fascism, and whataboutism is an ugly misdirection tactic. Just as many, if not even more people died in gulags or were killed by the invading Soviets as died in concentration camps. 

Also, the Nazi-Soviet cooperation was just the casus belli. You are right in the impact of the 1929 crisis. But capitalism having its flaws does not make communism good. The non-participation of the USSR in the partitioning of Czechoslovakia does not redeem its participation in the partitioning of Poland. 

&gt;Communists in French and Italian governments were absolutely legitimate (with 1,5 mln party members behind).

&gt;And you are defending opressive capitalistic regime to prove what?

Why is capitalism oppressive? At least they don't shoot poor people, while communist regimes imprisoned and frequently killed wealthier people. 

&gt;Capitalism goal is to get profit - where are you gonna get profit, when world is split? 

&gt;From nowhere. On opposite profit gonna be earned from results of your own labour or resources, that's it. 

Yes, but what is the other option? Food stamps? Standing in line for bananas like it's the new iPhone? Waiting decades to get a Trabant? Economies crumbling under government debt to maintain that low standard of living? Capitalism works, and communism didn't.

It does not exist yet, but [this is what was proposed](https://www.france24.com/en/france/20201130-french-parliament-drops-draft-law-curtailing-right-to-film-police): 


*Article 24 did not completely ban sharing images of the police, but made it a crime to share them with an ‚Äúobvious intention to harm‚Äù ‚Äì such as inciting violence against officers ‚Äì punishable by a year in prison and a ‚Ç¨45,000 ($54,000).*


*The bill aimed to prevent recognisable images of police officers from appearing on social media for fear they would face retribution for doing their jobs. The proposed ""global security"" law, as it was called, was partly a response to demands from police unions, who said it would provide greater protection for officers.*


I don't understand why so many people are shocked about this. It's already common for cops participating in anti-terrorist operations to cover their face with balaclavas to prevent retribution. Of course they can still be identified by the number on their uniforms, but it makes it more difficult for angry people to turn up at their houses.",Finland,/r/europe/comments/kbjyjr/emmanuel_macron_on_freedom_of_religion_freedom_of/gfjl6wg/,Silkkiuikku,1607789424

Another example is the Swiss ANSP controlling some parts of French and German airspace near the border, primarily because Geneva and Zurich airports are so close to the border.

The main role the Eurocontrol serves in operations, other than running MUAC, is being the ""Network Manager"" (NM). Each IFR flight files a flight plan through NM systems and the NM distributes these flight plans to the ANSPs that will be impacted by the flight. In addition, when an ANSP or foresees an overload in one of the sectors it controls, it can limit (""regulate"") the capacity of this sector. This is transmitted to NM, whose systems will calculate which flights that are currently on the ground need to be delayed on the ground and for how long in order to alleviate the predicted overload. Most of the time you hear the pilot announcing a delay for the flight before departure and the cause isn't immediately obvious, it's because it was assigned a delay by NM.

The cash-and-stock takeover announced on Saturday shows the Anglo-Swedish company‚Äôs determination to strengthen its position in immunology, already a core focus, alongside cancer treatments and those for cardiovascular, respiratory renal and metabolic diseases.¬†

It comes after months of speculation that AstraZeneca chief executive Pascal Soriot was hunting for a large target, seeking to take advantage of his company‚Äôs soaring share price that has seen the UK drugmaker become one of the largest listed businesses on the FTSE 100.

Under the terms of the transaction, Alexion shareholders will receive $60 in cash and 2.12 shares from AstraZeneca‚Äôs US-listed entity for each share they own.¬†

The transaction values Alexion at $175 per share, a 45 per cent premium to its closing price on Friday. Alexion shareholders will own about 15 per cent of the combined company.

But what makes you actually think Ukraine had not commited war crimes? Or rather, many Ukrainian people that went to conflict zones litteraly with the idea of getting rid of the ""Russian mongols"" one way or another.. there's also cases of the Ukrainian army shelling clearly civilian areas.

This investigation should look very closely at both sides, and I'm convinced they'll find plenty on both aswell.

I also remember 2 very similar cases of war crimes that happened from both sides. Corridors of retreat being attacked after cease-fire agreements. First separatists were shelled and killed, there were a lot of civilians, family members, wifes and children of the fighters in the convoys that were shelled... and then after that, The Ukrainian military were retreating trough a safe zone corridor and were ruthelesly shelled by separatists. The separatists excused this by saying that the condition of retreat was leaving behind the tanks and APCs and they didnt.

You understand, this conflict was very very dirty, and I'm suprised that in 2015-2020, my fellow slavs on both sides, still both behaved like absolute savages.

They stepped on George Floyd's neck until he died. There is video of it. And there are few things that justify the authorities murdering a member of the public in a free society. Unless he was actively committing a mass shooting and they had to shoot him to stop him, it was a murder and the officers should be in prison. 

As for the grooming gangs you referred to, they were atrocities, no question about that, and corruption at every level prevented them from being investigated.

But the murderers of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and countless  others were people who had power and authority.

1254,"Having a currency stably and predictably at the wrong level can be a problem, though. Imaging your domestic price level is too high compared to other Eurozone countries, as might happen in a country with a long history of higher inflation that hasn't managed to remove any of the causes of that.

The result could be the one we know already: people buy foreign products, with that outflowing spending balanced by incoming government borrowing (like Greece) or commercial lending (like Spain). Then, eventually, that incoming flow stops or slows. Where a country with a floating exchange rate might see a devaluation, bringing the price levels back in line, one in the Eurozone has to reduce its domestic price level the hard way.

Politicians used to talk of 'forced convergence' between Eurozone countries, requiring them to become more similar in the pressures on price levels. That means keeping wage growth down in some countries, for example.

One way to sustain this anyway is, of course, to use government to set up flows from taxes in countries like Germany to spending in countries like Greece - ie, fiscal union, which will not be popular in the higher income countries.",United Kingdom,/r/europe/comments/kb7ozl/another_one_thanks/gfi9qgg/,xelah1,1607768244

&gt;Seven people suspected of planning violent action were referred to the National Anti-Terrorism Prosecutor's Office (PNAT) on Friday.  The suspects come from the ultra-left movement.

&gt;A judicial investigation had been opened several months ago by the national anti-terrorism prosecution.  It is in this context that police officers from the Directorate General of Internal Security (DGSI) arrested nine individuals last Tuesday in the Paris region and in the Toulouse metropolitan area, explains BFMTV.

&gt;Coming from the far-left movement, they are suspected of preparing violent action, particularly targeting the police.  Searches were carried out and investigators seized weapons but also products that could enter into the design of the TATP, a powerful explosive.  They were in a truck.

 
 &gt;Steel balls were also found, along with a sawn-off shotgun, revolver, knife, and ammunition, the chain of information said.  Investigators also discovered protective equipment for law enforcement, including leggings, a helmet and a shield.

&gt;A man who fought with the Kurds. The truck belongs to one of the defendants, Florian D., who is a fall anarchist activist who fought in Rojava, a Kurdish enclave in Syria, alongside the Kurds.  The man returned to France in January 2018 after spending 10 months there, say our colleagues.  He is suspected of wanting to form a group to commit violent acts.

&gt;seven of the nine arrested - six men and a woman aged 30 to 36 - were referred to the PNAT after 72 hours in police custody.  They will be presented to an anti-terrorism investigating judge.  The other two suspects will be released.",,/r/europe/comments/kblhot/suspected_of_preparing_violent_action_7_members/gfi2mtm/,szarnyaskezuszeretok,1607760721

1343,"The fiscal union cannot happen with Germany without a referendum. No German government  may transfer the ultimate authority over finances to any other party.

The German constitutional court has made that very clear:

[https://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/SharedDocs/Entscheidungen/EN/2014/03/rs20140318\_2bvr139012en.html](https://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/SharedDocs/Entscheidungen/EN/2014/03/rs20140318_2bvr139012en.html)

(I inserted \[...\] when i left some parts out to keep it readable.)

&gt; 1. The Basic Law not only prohibits the transfer of *Kompetenz-Kompetenz* to the European Union or to institutions created in connection with the European Union \[...\].  The German constitutional organs may not grant blanket empowerments for the exercise of public authority either \[...\].  Dynamic treaty provisions therefore must be interpreted in a manner that respects the *Integrationsverantwortung* and must therefore be made contingent on suitable safeguards for the effective exercise of this responsibility. For borderline cases of what is still constitutionally permissible, the legislature must, where necessary, make effective arrangements in the legislation that accompanies the Act of Assent to ensure that there is enough room for its responsibility with respect to integration.  
&gt;  
&gt; 2. Art.¬†38 sec.¬†1 GG is violated in particular if the German *Bundestag* relinquishes its budgetary responsibility with the effect that it or a future *Bundestag* can no longer exercise the right to decide on the budget on its own \[...\]. Deciding on public revenue and public expenditure is a fundamental part of the ability of a constitutional state to democratically shape itself \[...\]. The German *Bundestag* must therefore make decisions on revenue and expenditure with responsibility to the people. In this context, the right to decide on the budget is a central element for shaping opinions in a democratic society \[...\], which must also be adhered to in a system of intergovernmental governing (a). 

And to anybody who has the bright idea to simply change the articles in the basic law that prevent this, the government cannot. The articles responsible are all at the end protected by an eternity clause (Article 79 of the basic law), meaning no German government may ever change them. Only way to evade this is via a referendum where the citizens of Germany vote in a new basic law.",Germany,/r/europe/comments/kbjsqi/angela_merkel_calls_for_creation_of_european/gfi38y8/,Alcobob,1607761355

1424,"&gt; I genuinely wonder what Erdogan‚Äôs game plan is.

Simply being more respected as a country.

***
&gt; So make enemies with the EU 

Eh. What the decision, and the caricature OP posted above, show is that the EU isn't Erdogan's ennemy. The EU is too cowardly for that... 

The only two EU countries who are actually genuinely ""against"" Turkey right now are France and Greece, due to their own history and actions. You could try to make a case for a few others european countries (like maybe Italy), but they are far less active. And well, Greece can't do anything on its own. As for France, Macron made some noise, but concretely, while tensions rose, not much happened... 

&gt; and US.

What hostile action did Turkey take toward the US ?

* If you're talking about the Kurds, then it's more the US picking a fight with the Turks by supporting the Kurds in the Syrian civil war than the other way around. 
* If it's about buying that weapon system from Russia, that's not really ""making an ennemy of the US""... 

Either way, Turkey doesn't try to pay hardball with the US, and the US largely remained silent on the current issues involving Turkey. 

&gt; Then make enemies with Iran 

Eh

Another case where they aren't really ""ennemies"". Turkey and Iran maybe be struggling for influence in the middle east, but they are far from the only ones, and that's really nothing new. The middle east has been squabbling about who is top dog in the region since they got independence from the colonial powers... Not to mention, Iran has better things to do than fighting the Turks, and vice versa.

Also, since the current areas of conflict are Iraq and Syria, can we really act as if Turkey is responsible ? If anything, it's the US fault for taking out Saddam and destabilizing everything... Turkey just reacted to this situation. 

&gt; and Russia.

Turkey and Russia are playing a game of influence in the region, but they aren't ennemies either. I mentionned above the sale of weapon, and that's not what ennemies do.

&gt; Then what? There‚Äôs no room to move.

There's plenty of room to move. Turkey isn't fighting seriously any of the countries you mentionned seriously, and so they can play all sides. 

* If the US view doesn't favor them, then they can go to Russia
* If the russian view doesn't favor them, they can go talk to NATO
* If the EU pretends to do something, they can ignore it and continue what they were doing.",France,/r/europe/comments/kb7ozl/another_one_thanks/gfhvw7j/,SpyMonkey3D,1607754408

if the UK government is serious about that pledge, it shouldn't have no problems with the EU standards (which are only a minimum threshold member countries cannot go lower while it is always possible to set higher and higher standards). If your government has problems to abide to higher standards, it's because it has every intention to lower them at some point. 

Just like Johnson had every intention to renege from the Withdrawal Agreement from the start.

The UK government has given [mixed signals](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/27/report-casts-doubt-uk-pledge-prevent-low-quality-food-imports-brexit) about its intentions. And we know from the Internal Market Bill that even a signed and ratified binding international agreement is not enough to stop the government from willfully breaking the law.

1821,"&gt;I interpreted your previous comment. Swedishness, I agree is much more of an idea than Sweden the land. However nations are physical lands in addition to being ideas. Swedishness/Scottishness are also arguably physical observable things too: our genes are distinct (for our old countries).

Land is land nothing more. Nations are myths with boundaries that doesn't exist. We have however collectively agreed that those boundaries exist, even though those boundaries only truly exist in our minds. This is not necessarily a bad thing. So no, nations aren't physical lands, just ideas.

Swedishness is interesting as a concept. 400 years ago a finnish-speaking finn would identify as a Swede to people outside the Kingdom, he lived in Sweden after all. 700 years ago majority of Stockholmers would probably identify more closely with a North German identity than Swedish.
Meanwhile Swedish traditions changed and evolved throughout time. The stereotypical Swedishness we know today is mostly based on 18-19th century Dalarna and has then evolved to incorporate most of the population, including people that don't share genes with me. It has evolved that way because most of those who identified as Swedes choose to, those who disagree vote SD, so about 15-23%.

So no I don't think Swedishness is easily observable at all.

&gt;
Again, this is a gender role. It is preformative, not innate.

Wouldn't you agree that in most cases you can tell what gender someone identifies by looking at how they choose to express themselves?


&gt;.. and? So are ugly people, or short people. Harrison Bergeron illustrates where your level-playing-field ends. People are born with differences, some are beneficial in certain aspects of life, some are detrimental. This is life.

Who is risking getting persecuted because they are ugly or short? Meanwhile racism and transphobia is mainstream asf.


&gt;If your stance/idea/etc. can't make sense in a vacuum, then it is not correct.

I want to frame this quote on a wall. Nothing exists in a vacuum, especially not politics or society.

&gt;The truth is the truth no matter who says it.


The problem isn't if the statement ""life is hard"", it always will be to some degree. The problem is the context and most importantly the intent of the statement. You're using that statement as an excuse why we shouldn't try to make life better for others.

&gt; It is not that crying is weakness, it is the reason for why you are crying that determines if you are to be viewed as weak or not.

Depends on who defines it. I have read several personal stories (second-hand anecdotal, I know) about women close to them ignoring them when they cried about serious stuff. Fuckin' awful.
And even if it's about something ""silly"" like stress: Hey, sometimes homie gotta cry, doesn't make him lesser.

&gt;FWIW, I too cannot cry, or feel sad at all. Better living through chemistry.

I interpreted ""chemistry"" as ""medication"", English isn't my first language so I might've gotten it wrong, anyway:

As someone who is not at all qualified to speak on this issue to me it just seems like kicking the can down the road, like the goal seems to me like getting off medication at some point. I realise chances are what I am saying is dumb asf.

Personally I like feeling sad sometimes every now and then. Especially because most of the times I feel sad these days is due to me being ashamed, and shame is mostly a helpful feeling. 
Chronic depression however? Yeah, fuck that.

&gt;Recovery? My depression and anxiety were not caused by trauma, I just am depressed and anxious naturally. For me it really is taking my medication and deciding not to feel that way.

Alright, then it's pretty dumb to tell people who've actually experienced much worse to pull themselves up by their bootstraps unironically.

&gt;You (and other left-wing people) are free to do so, right now. The issue is that you want to force everyone to go along with you. Start your own (or join a) commune - surely if your way of living is superior we will all join you. (not being snarky here, I want you to explain why you wouldn't do so - and why everyone doesn't live in communes already)

I want to force? I'd rather convince a sizeable amount.
And like I've already made clear: I'm neither a communist or an anarchist (atleast during current circumstances). Why would I want to live in a commune?

&gt;You need only look at the news, the curriculum taught in schools, social media, etc. to see the abuse hurled at the right. That there are a great many closeted right-wingers who turn out to vote is no proof of there being no abuse.

Closeted in Britain? The Tories do really well in polling? A lot of British press is rightwing asf, like famously right-wing and quite nasty too.

On social media I see right-wing people harrass people all the time. What part of the curriculum is anti-right? I'm not british but the Swedish is pretty biased towards socdem and liberal-to-liberal conservative. Far-left and far-right it is absolutely biased against.

And our formerly pro-Swexit right-wing party is usually overrepresented in polls (not pro-Swexit anymore for obvious reasons).

&gt;If you can tie my actions directly to the harm of another, feel free to. However, I'm certain it's a cumulative effect with no individual to point at as the cause. Even the poorest individual on the planet emits greenhouse gasses just by breathing. Sure I may emit considerably more by living like I do, but if this is a tragedy of the commons, we are all guilty.

I think I've made very clear that I don't blame individuals.

&gt;Additionally, you completely overlook the positive contribution the rich are making: who funds all the efforts to address and adapt to climate change? Overwhelmingly the wealthy. The starving child in Africa ... almost 0 contribution. As I believe the only solution will be in technology (i.e. humanity won't stop economic activity), it is the rich doing the overwhelming majority of the work to address climate change - where is their credit?

We've already been over the technology argument. What do you expect a starving child (starving literally hurts brain development) with no access to decent education to do? Pull themselves up by their bootstrap so they may help combat climate change that they're barely responsible for?

Richest 10% account for 52% of carbon dioxide emission, Richest 1% account for more than twice the poorest half of humanity. The rich are entirely to blame for this issue in the first place, doing some half-measures to feel good about themselves while the poor will face the consequences doesn't make them heroes.

&gt;Not at all. I am only concerned about myself. The only time I take any view on others is when they take actions which affect me. From transgendered people demanding how I speak, to Marxists wanting to take my earnings, to left-wing politicians telling me who I must do business with, all of these left-wing people are instigating action which negatively impacts me. If transgendered people didn't talk to me, I would never call them the ""wrong"" pronoun. If Marxists used their own earnings to help people, I would never vote against their policies. If left-wing politicians didn't write laws forcing me to do things against my will, I would not vote them out of office.

&gt;Those like me on the libertarian/right of the spectrum just want to be left alone. My ideas and actions will be none of your concern, so long as your ideas and actions do not involve me.

It's almost as if in society nothing exists in a vacuum. It's almost as if every day in your life you have to confront structures of power.
And non-libertarian right-wingers absolutely want to bother people all the time and don't want to leave anyone alone.

&gt;Why won't you (meaning left-wing people) just leave us alone?

""7 members of the ultra left, suspected of preparing a violent project, referred to the anti-terrorist prosecution


INFO BFMTV - Seven people were brought before the national anti-terrorism prosecution on Friday. From the ultra left movement, they are suspected of having planned violent action.

Nine people, aged in their thirties, were arrested last Tuesday in Vitry-sur-Seine, in the Paris region, in Toulouse and Cubjac, in the Dordogne by police officers from the General Directorate of Internal Security (DGSI) , suspected of preparing a violent action.

Several months ago, an investigation was opened by the national anti-terrorism prosecution on a possible plan to act. Investigations have shown that these individuals, from the ultra left movement, in particular planned to attack the police. However, the degree of preparation of their project remains to be determined.

Weapons discovered

In the truck belonging to one of the individuals arrested, the police discovered products used to make TATP, an explosive, steel balls, but also weapons, a sawed-off shotgun, a revolver, a knife. and ammunition. At the home of one of the other suspects, CRS equipment such as leggings, a helmet, a policing shield, was found.

According to our information, this truck belonged to a certain Florian D., who turns out to be one of the suspects. He is an autonomous anarchist activist who fought in Rojava, a Kurdish enclave in Syria, alongside the Kurds. He spent 10 months there before returning in January 2018. Since then, the police have suspected him of forming a group in order to carry out guerrilla actions in France.

After three days in police custody, seven people, six men and one woman, were brought on Friday to be presented to an anti-terrorist judge for possible indictment. The prosecution has already requested the placement in pre-trial detention against some of the suspects. The other two individuals arrested saw their custody lifted.

1888,"[...] Because from the original idea - money is only given to those who adhere to the basic values of the EU - little is left when viewed in the light of day. This is mainly due to three things, all of which were pushed through by Poland and Hungary:

The mechanism is, contrary to what was initially envisaged, narrowly limited to budgetary issues: Violations of the rule of law are now only to be punished if they concern the use of EU funds. Other violations of fundamental values, such as the restriction of media freedom and freedom of expression or the suppression of minorities, are excluded.

Another problem is the majority needed to trigger them. According to the Commission's first proposal, sanctions against rule-of-law offenders should be quasi-automatic - unless a qualified majority of member states were against it. Now it is the other way round: 15 of the 27 EU countries with at least 65 percent of the EU population must be in favour. Observers assume that this hurdle can only be cleared in extreme cases - if at all.

The mechanism is accompanied by a declaration of the heads of state and government. Among other things, it states that the EU Commission should only apply the mechanism once the European Court of Justice has ruled on its legality. According to the Commission's estimates, this will take almost a year. If it were to set the mechanism in motion after that, the procedure would take another few months. [...]

That doesn't matter. If the regime kills anyone who writes about trade unions, then it's probably not easy for the people to unionise, so worker's rights are likely bad.

Anyhow, the Mujahideen dissolved as soon as the Soviet Union left, and they quickly began infighting.

2050,"Sees which ""newspaper"" publishes this and, quelle surprise, it's the daily telegraph, aka the torygraph, aka the newspaper that pays Johnson 100k for a few opinion articles stuffed with euro lies and deliberately misleading claims. 

The UK has not been punished, because giving it a free trade deal is not a right they are entitled to. It's something that we give to third countries  (so what the British people voted to become in relation with the EU) provided that it suits our interests and conditional to the compliance of said country to our standards and laws. 

The less the third country is prepared to comply with, the smaller the access to our market will be. The UK wanted a frictionless access to our single market without giving back anything of equal value. 

But I understand that when you are used to getting your way for centuries by virtue of bullish behaviour (see the opium war in China or the Suez canal crisis or the cod wars with Iceland), anything but deference to their elite is seen as punishment.","Ein Tirol ist nicht genug, dem S√ºdtirol gebe Ich mein Vorzug",/r/europe/comments/katw7y/vindictive_eu_harms_itself_by_turning_brexit_into/gff2ud0/,standy85,1607710502

London still remains the largest exporter of financial services, world wide. London remains, by far, the world's leader when it comes to global currency trading - representing 41% of the global market. New York comes in second at 19%. London trades more US dollars than New York and more Euros than all European cities combined. I doubt all this will change on the 1st Jan. The EU would suffer as much as the UK, economically.

2067,"You're misinformed or just not being objective with what you're saying. 

Turkey is a high productivity country, you are looking at GDP/hours worked which is highly flawed and its usage is criticized extensively. It gives countries like Norway/Saudi arabia/Ireland the highest productivity which is far from reality, they aren't more productive they have more natural resources in the case of Norway/SA and Ireland because its a tax haven. 

Comparing african countries with no infrastructure, no economic deals and no education is just silly. You can't compare countries with tons of differences and only analyse one metric. 

In this case young working age population is advantageous if other things go accordingly. Look at Italy for the counterpoint, Turkeys GDP per capita before covid was predicted to surpass Italy by 2050, mostly because Italy has a terrible dependancy ratio which is No of ppl working age/No of ppl retired age. 

Education might be getting worse but not really, you have an overblown opinion. While i can't agree with the state promoting religion and such it doesn't have a huge effect. 

A more important point is that 10-20 years ago only a fraction of people even completed High school level education, nowadays i think everyone completes High school level. And there are over 7 million university level students. Of course a saturation of educated people doesn't mean economic success but for a country who had very few people at degree level this is helpful in kicking off new industry/growth. 

Its location will always be important, the fact that it simply sits between the two most important continents on earth gives it strategic significance. This isn't related to the Middle-east or anything. 

Beyond this simple speculation its simply best to read up on reports done by actual economic experts who's job is to study future prospects of nations. PWC 2050 analysis predicts Turkey to surpass Italy in GDP per capita by 2050. With a predicted GDP per capita of $53,000, for comparison Japan is predicted at 63,000 France, 66,000, Germany 82,000, UK 72,000.

It won't suddenly become richer than Europe or anything but it will close the gap, which is a good thing because wealth usually = stability and Europe benefits from a stable Turkey.

Not starting a story from the beginning is a surefire way to discard inconvenient truths. I am Jewish, father born in Israel, just for context. I have a friend I went to high school with who now lives in a settlement in the West Bank. He sees Palestinians as dogs, nothing more. They work hard, but to him they aren‚Äôt human, they have no right or reason to even be physically present in Israel because God gave the land to the Jews and the Jews alone. It says so in the Torah, so it is true (according to him and others like him). He is one of many right-wing Jews in Israel who want to do what the Nazis did to our ancestors: relocate them, at the very least, but if they won‚Äôt leave, just exterminate them. Until that is permissible, they opt for collective punishment (your son was arrested for suspected ‚Äúterrorism‚Äù? Now your entire village will be bulldozed.‚Äù These ideas and the ideology that supports them are not just held by average folks, they‚Äôre held by high-level Israeli government officials, including Netanyahu (how the fuck that man is still in office is beyond me). And before we start on the ‚Äúwell what about Hamas...‚Äù train, condemning violence and hatred by one group *in no way, shape, or form* condones violence and hatred by another. Israel also endangers Jews around the world by claiming to act in their name as they oppress the Palestinian people.

2142,"\&gt; I know at the end of the war the UK was crippled. We didn't have the resources to go to war with Russia.  


Oh, you were lucky that Poland in 1940 and following years was in such great condition that it could spare some soldiers to defend England :-)   


\&gt; Poland might blame us for not helping them against Russia, but we came to your aid against Germany.  


No, you didn't, really. UK reaction to the Nazi invasion on Poland was pretty much equivalent to today's bunch of angry tweets condemning Hitler's behaviour. You met in Abbeville with French and decided not to do anything really (phoney war does not really count). After Hitler invaded Denmark, you thought that it might be wise to pretend him from putting his hands on Norway, but it was only after the France was attacked that you really went into war. 

\&gt; Wars are brutal to all those involved, the UK was drained after WW2. The anger of the Polish should be aimed towards the aggressor, not a country that went to war for you.  


As we all know, Poland after WW2 was the land of milk and honey, so selling it to Soviets could only help by shaving the overflowing goods and money off it. /s  


Of course Poles are angly at the attackers, but they are also angly at the allies, who promised to go to war with us, and did not fulfilled their promise, then when they were attacked themselves, accepted Polish help, and then, again, when they were already secured, sold Poles down to Soviets, as since they themselves were already secure, they didn't care about their ally anymore.   


\&gt; However that is in the past. Before my time and most people now  


That's true. However, Britain tends to be unable to come to terms with the wrongdoing in its history. And if we remember its colonial past, Polish episode is miniscule compared to other sins that Britain should admit to.   


I think coming to terms with its own history will do Britain only good, as it would mean decomposition of this false myth of Britain being the best, glorious country and the mighty empire. Britons would do much better if they understood that their unique position and richness came not by that they are somehow better, but by centuries of abusing and exploiting of other nations. If you had that proper perspective and saw yourself (I am using plural form as per nation, I am not addressing you personally or your friends), then perhaps you would not make such stupid decissions as Brexit, which was posible, in my opinion, solely because of the deep belief in British society that you are somehow better than others.",,/r/europe/comments/kapd5i/please_help/gfej6cl/,Zenon_Czosnek,1607703335

2223,"&gt; Why does Erdogan has to be my representative? It doesn't always work like that. Of course there are radical erdogan supporters but it doesn't represent at least %70 of the people 

I'm not saying he represents your beliefs but from a national standpoint, the president as the head of the country, for all intents and purposes is the country. If he declares war on a country, unless there's a coup, then Turkey will be in war and it will bear the consequences. That's how it works with country leaders. 

In every single country there are always people with different opinions and views from their leaders but that doesn't say anything in the end. When a country acts, others countries will react and it will be on a national level, not a personal one. 

&gt; Were german people responsible for that physchomaniac hitler's actions? 

Not all Germans but his supporters were, on a large degree. It's not like his agenda was secret. Nazi Germany is actually a good example. A lot of Germans were against Hitler, some even tried to kill him numerous times but despite that fact the obvious outcome was that all Germans paid for it because of his actions. It doesn't matter if a chunk of people disagree with him. On a global scale Germany as a nation was responsible for an entire world war and many war crimes and it paid a heavy price cause... well i can't believe that i have to explain this but other countries that were so deeply affected by war, weren't going to sit idle and say ""naaah some Germans are innocent though, why should they be affected? Let's not fight and defeat Germany cause if we win those guys will pay for it and it's not fair"".

2261,"&gt;David Frost and Michel Barnier are going round the track one more time ahead of the latest Brexit deadline on Sunday night. But there‚Äôs a problem: the dinner that Boris Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen had on Wednesday night gave the negotiators little to work with. The leaders had two courses of fish but are no closer on fishing. They discussed their positions on European Union business rules and standards (the so-called level playing field) but kept their distance intellectually as well as physically.

&gt;One of those close to the talks on the British side says that Johnson ‚Äúdid try to propose creative solutions to some of the thorniest issues. They listened but they didn‚Äôt react.‚Äù


&gt;The danger is that the remaining optimism on the European side comes from a belief that Johnson will climb down at the last minute. This is a dangerous misreading of the situation. Johnson is under very little domestic pressure to do so. I am told that ‚Äúaround the cabinet table there is a strong desire for a deal, but there is a willingness to do no-deal‚Äù. The sense that the EU hardened up its position late last week has strengthened the cabinet‚Äôs resolve. In parliament, Johnson has an 80-seat majority, his party behind him and a leader of the opposition who is visibly uncomfortable talking about Brexit, as this week‚Äôs PMQs showed.

&gt;Then, there is the question of the practicalities of no-deal. Brexit will inevitably bring disruption, as you‚Äôd expect given that the UK has been trading as a member of the customs union since 1973 and has been part of the single market since its creation in 1992. And Brexit would be far easier to manage with the goodwill that comes with a trade deal. However, the prime minister doesn‚Äôt really see it this way. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs inoculated against Project Fear,‚Äù says one veteran of the process; this is one vaccine that might prove to have been a little too effective.


&gt;The fundamental problem is that the two sides view the negotiations very differently. As one weary British official puts it: ‚ÄúThey view us as a departing member state, not as a country they are doing a trade deal with.‚Äù The British view is that the withdrawal agreement dealt with the process of leaving and this agreement should be about the future. But much of the EU‚Äôs thinking reflects a mindset that fails to appreciate that the UK was quite serious about leaving in the first place. For instance, the EU is keen that Britain doesn‚Äôt deliver what it regards as unfair state aid when the Covid recovery starts. But the EU itself has no plans to restrict itself in this way and thinks that not only its coronavirus recovery scheme but the European Commission and European Investment Bank funding in general should be exempt from subsidy rules. It is not reciprocal for the EU to be able to exempt its ‚Ç¨750 billion fund from the treaty‚Äôs subsidy rules when the UK‚Äôs post-Covid funding would be subject to them.

&gt;These double standards would quickly pose problems in other areas. Imagine that the EU decides to fund development of a zero-emissions jet plane. ‚ÄúSupranational‚Äù subsidies for this project would not be caught in the current agreement, but if Johnson went ahead with a British ‚Äújet zero‚Äù he‚Äôd be expected to follow the treaty‚Äôs state-aid rules. This is not fair. The EU should make clear that for any EU-level funding that is exempt from state aid rules, a proportionate amount of UK funding would be permitted.

&gt;The same problem can be seen in the biggest sticking point in the talks, the so-called ratchet clause. This is meant to address what happens if the EU tightens its regulations in one area and the UK does not follow suit. The EU wants the right to unilaterally impose tariffs in these circumstances. There would be no obligation to show that Britain‚Äôs different standards were distorting trade. The EU would simply be able to act. But Britain would not be able to hit back. The text proposed by the EU would block us from responding to measures that they thought were unfair or disproportionate with their tariffs.

&gt;It is not sustainable to have a system where Brussels can act as judge and jury and then unilaterally disarm the UK to prevent it from taking countermeasures. There is, however, a potential solution to this problem. The EU could still have the right to respond if it increased regulations and Britain didn‚Äôt follow. It would, though, not be able to do this automatically. Rather, it would have to go to arbitration and show that the different standards were having a material effect. This would deal with the EU‚Äôs medium-term concern about Britain trying to undercut it while maintaining zero-tariff, zero-quota access to its market. It would also reassure the British side that it could not be subject to capricious actions by Brussels every time the EU introduced a relatively minor change.

&gt;Fish is the other great sticking point. The issue has become totemic on both sides of the Channel and the importance of fishing in Scotland has grown in salience given the elections there next year and mounting concern in Whitehall about the Union. But it should be possible to find a fix. Britain wants exclusive rights to the fishing up to 12 miles off its coast. This will hurt boats from France, the Netherlands, Belgium and Ireland, which have traditionally fished in these waters. But given that in 2015 EU fishermen caught about ¬£17 million worth of fish in the six to 12-mile zone, it should be possible to compensate them in cash terms and by allowing them more rights elsewhere.

&gt;It is sometimes assumed that the dinners and the ever-slipping deadlines are just theatre: that the two sides know they will do a deal but both want to wait until the last moment. This is, alas, untrue. The prospects for a deal look worse than they have for some time. The two sides need to step back and look at the big picture.

&gt;They can let this descend into no-deal, poisoning relations between the EU and the UK, or they can make it the beginning of a new partnership based on reciprocity and mutual respect. When Johnson and von der Leyen speak on Sunday, they should do so in person and with an acute awareness of what is at stake.",,/r/europe/comments/kb3itx/the_eu_has_dangerously_misread_britain/gfe5o2h/,DecentAttention9,1607696160

&gt;  
&gt; EU are overplaying their hand now and not negotiating in good faith. 

You're putting a moral spin on a story where there is none. The EU is just stating the following: ""We want access to UK waters to fish. Not giving this to our fishing industry constitutes a political cost we are probably not willing to pay. Your choice."" The rest is just rhetoric. In the same vein, there is no hand to play, or cake to be eaten. There are just two possibilities: deal (involving fish and other concessions from the UK) or no deal. If no deal happens, it won't be because the EU, or the UK for that matter, overplayed their hand.

But that's only because the Germans and the Dutch were so close, that the differences in the Middle Ages were not that strong. But since the Middle Ages, eastern dialects started shifting towards the Franconian Dutch. Plenty of reasons for this, partly political, partly economic, partly cultural, partly religious etc. In short, those 'Low Germans' transformed into the Dutch. Just like how the Gaullish tribes transformed into a Romance speaking people. Peoples and their identities change over time. I also wonder what you would then consider 'natural developments'. The Germans in Sudetenland did not suddenly start speaking Czech because they were in specific lines. Their language was based on their people, of course pressured by external factors like politics, and as a result they spoke German.   


My point is not that every people stayed exactly the same over the centuries. My point is when we speak of the Dutch, we do not speak about persons that happen to live between a certain line. We are speaking of a people, with a shared identity, and that is the basis of the boundaries of nation-states as we know it, starting since the French revolution.

- You can hit the population to show them they should vote in a different party. This one is too blunt and probably will backfire. You'd only use it against a dictatorship where elections cannot unseat the regime.

- You can weaken the financial basis of the state and the military. This means there's simply less money for the military and no access to modern weapons. This has been done to Argentine, Iran, and North Korea - and of course the USA just cancelled the Turkish F-35. Typically this results in a lot of chest beating but has dramatic effects. Neither Argentine, nor Iran or North Korea have an air force worth shit and they are fuming over it. Venezuela also suffer enormously because their oil infrastructure is rotting.

- You can punish the oligarchs. Every autocratic country is deeply corrupt and there are always sycophants profiting. If they cannot fly to London or their family can only visit the Riviera without them, they might try to influence the strongman. This obviously doesn't work for Russia (Putin simply deports unruly oligarchs to Siberia), so IDK whether there's data how successful this is.

2461,"A good dub can make a bad movie bearable. On the other hand a bad dub can kill a masterpiece.

Watching the original (English) version in a dubbing country is usually the ultimate test for advanced learners, so there's even a bit of a stigma for dubbed material as it's ""for the uneducated masses"" as opposed to the smart ones who are able to enjoy the original version.

But in fairness, it's just pointless snobbery.

As said, good dubs are actually a work of art themselves and in some countries (e.g. Italy) have a long and brilliant tradition of voice-acting.

The only really annoying part is that, with the oversaturation of content and channels the talent pool has become too shallow and you often end up getting the same voice actor playing like 4-5 prominent roles. Or relatively minor characters in 10 different shows sharing the same voice.

It's quite jarring hearing ""Phoebe"" also playing a CSI detective, or Lisa Simpson and Steve Urkel sharing the same voice (with a marginal tonal difference).

Indeed, there are plenty of lessons to be remembered here.

The first one, of  course, is the grand total of exactly zero fatality.

Then, *all the other* coastal nuclear plants that rode the tsunami. One was so badly damaged that it was written off, still without any consequence outside of the containment building. The rest ? Meh.

The most interesting part in Daichi-3 is how earth scientists had long ago recommanded the upgrading of the tsunami protection, how this upgrading had been made legally mandatory, how the TEPCO management prioritized profits over safety, and  how regulation authorities failed to notice and act. All in all a story of public management of industrial risk, which, alas, isn't specific to atomic electricity generation.

All in all, quite the contrary of *the best, most carefully designed contingency plan.*

This article presents the first results of a nowcasting exercise focused on the estimation of employment income losses along the distribution. All figures provided are part of the experimental statistics produced by Eurostat in the frame of advanced estimates on income inequality and poverty indicators.

The impact of the crisis is very unequally spread between Member States and is particularly strong for the most vulnerable sub-groups of the working population, with low wage earners having losses 3 to 6 times larger than high wage earners in half of the EU Member States.

National governments have put in place or activated short-term work schemes to address the COVID-19 economic challenges, in particular, policies to preserve jobs (wage compensation schemes). These contributed to mitigate the income loss in all EU countries with the overall income loss reduced by half.",Romania,/r/europe/comments/kaxdk5/covid19_impact_on_employment_income_in_the_eu_he/gfd99o2/,filosoful,1607667862

OLaNO - strongly populist and narcissistic leader, leader leans conservative right, but has strongly religious conservative personalities inside (minister of health seriously claimed he saw the holy spirit entering someone, they also have a couple of christian activists who are extremely against abortions, etc...). They claim to be centrist though because they do have a couple of leftist liberals inside. Their whole look is that they‚Äôre representing the ordinary people, as opposed to career politicians. They have the most seats in government and parliament now but are one of the smallest parties with most nominants being non-members. A lot of them are therefore unknown variables. 

Sme Rodina - strongly populist, business type folks. They claim to defend the ‚Äúordinary families‚Äù from threats (mainly ends with anti-immigration policies, etc.). Their second in command is strongly religious guy with nickname ‚ÄúThe Last Crusader‚Äù. However they are on board with any policy as long as its publicly popular.

SaS - economic liberalists now as most of their socially left-liberal members left for the more leftist liberal PS party. Leader is neoliberal leaning libertarian but doesn‚Äôt care about anything other than economy. Wants to deregulate everything and have the most open markets. They have some left-ish members though. They like data-based approach and scientific method and as such often clash with the PM from OLaNO who prefers ‚Äúthinking with his heart‚Äù and on the spot decisions. This is the most predictable party in Gov right now. 

Za Ludi - centrist party who decided they would avoid the left-right divide and try to do what‚Äôs best for Slovakia. They do have one or two MPs leaning left and one or two leaning right but they don‚Äôt have a unified opinion. They are the most neutral party in gov now, so they are often labeled ‚Äúleftist‚Äù by right wingers.

I would call all of them centrist but SaS is more predictable, Za Ludi more neutral and OLaNO and Sme Rodina straight up chaotic - I have no idea what to expect from them in the long run. 

In the opposition we have LSNS - basically neonazis with low education targeting lowly educated poor populace. Smer - former communists, in the past years spewing more and more hate, strong ties to oligarchy. Targeting mainly pensioners. Hlas - guys who left Smer because they‚Äôre trying to be less radical, but still have some ties to oligarchy and they are mostly a new party formed this year so largely no idea what to expect.",Slovakia,/r/europe/comments/kadhgz/democracy_in_slovakia_just_died/gfcnbkp/,black3rr,1607654420

I'm not referring to the NK territories, either. 

Whether they were binding or not is entirely besides the point. Firstly, there was an existing obigation under international law. Secondly, the point I was making is that the Western powers made their opposition to Armenia's actions clear. That being the case, it's insane to expect these same powers to protect Armenia from their consequences.

2947,"Basically the person replying referred to a school system change where pupils aged 7-16 started attending the same completely free of charge schooling  when before even rather young children had to apply to a track for more academically oriented schooling which cost money and others had more basic education. I would argue this has more to do with Finland developing generally to an egalitarian society where social mobility is very possible rather than a gender question. However, I assume it also helped with women becoming more educated as well.  

After 16 you still decide if you go to high school or trade school. And after that, college - all free of charge. 

Finland has a long history of gender equality/women in politics in the sense that we were among the first to give women voting rights and the right to seek office in Parliament/Congress (1906).

3016,"&gt; So where do you see this trend? I see a 3% change from this time last year, in terms of trends that is jack shit.  

To see a trend you don't compare same months between different years, you look at the change between consequent months and look at the general direction. After the dip in 2018 there was a slow and steady growth, with barely any changes 1-2% at most. In 2020 there was a big dive and rise again in the first half, that could be explained by methodology change. And then there is a new dip starting from September, when summer has ended and first wave of bankruptcies of small and medium sized businesses started (due to insufficient support during the pandemic). It goes on for 3 months now and there is no sign of it ending any time soon, because situation in the country only gets worse. And there was nothing like that in 2019.  

&gt; To be honest, I'm not a scientist and I'm not following much of the criticism there, but I do not see the anonymous author of that article actually pointing out any lies.   

Criticism is that they don't follow the scientific procedure for testing the vaccine. They also don't want to provide actual information about their test and don't want to be held accountable. They also bend statistics to look better than their competitors and that's only gist of it without going deeper. I think it's a really dangerous behavior, because even if vaccine is good it has such a bad reputation, that could endanger mass vaccination.    

&gt; If I understand correctly, this person is a programmer, not a medical professional of any note.  

He is, but it doesn't matter, because most of his claims are either sourced or easily googleable. I just linked something more condensed.  

&gt; It has shown Putin has enough support to openly make himself president for life.  

That's quite a stretch. Considering amount of falsification and how rigged procedure was from the beginning. Also, even if real numbers still favor Putin, it doesn't automatically mean that people would actually vote for him. Especially considering that most of them didn't even knew what constitutional amendments were really about. 

&gt; However, if you're outright rejecting those numbers, then we really don't have any basis to discuss the handling of the pandemic in Russia.  

We have. We can look at death count of previous years and compare it with death count of 2020. Excess mortality is going to help to make an approximate picture. It gives us a number of 120k more people dead, than in 5 previous years. This is at least 3 times smaller than Rosstat figure.

&gt; I also thought that measures for supporting the economy in Russia were too small, but then again, I'm not an economist, and Russia doesn't seem to be crashing as hard as some.  

It's hard to fall, when you are already at the bottom. Also you don't see a crash (yet), because more than 70% (if I'm not mistaken) of Russian business sector are large state monopolies. And government made sure that they won't fail, of course. Results of remaining 30% slowly dying out are not gonna surface here and now it's a slow process.

If you need to be mindful of the budget consider an itinerary thorough Poland, Czechia, Slovakia (maybe with a quick trip to Vienna), Hungary, Croatia. The costs still add up (do NOT imagine it will be like in that EuroTrip movie) but you'll definitely get more bang for your buck, so to speak.

In my experience (as an eastern European 'pauper') in countries such as Italy, Germany, Spain (not to mention Sweden or Norway) costs can quickly add up. And keep in mind that if you put in the effort to travel all the way here you might not want to eat the cheapest supermarket food available (or McDonalds, that sounds like a pretty bad plan) and only drink tap water, since part of the experience is trying out a local restaurant or bar.

3220,"You'll probably get a million different opinions from every person there is in Serbia, so here's mine. When the opposition was in the parliament it was not only impossible for them to do anything as they were in a tiny minority but it was pretty much impossible for them to even talk as the ruling party has taken ""parliamentary obstruction"" to a new level. They were proposing 1000s of new amandmands and laws which differ in the current ones only in wording. When the opposition politicians finally got the chance to propose something a whole number of shitstorms occured. Booing from the ruling party members, their microphones got turned off at times and similar things happened.

So, the boycott of the national parliament is a rather logical method of fighting against the ruling party.  Either way you can't to anything there as an opposition member and while boycotting you can maybe get the attention of european and world leaders, media and gain the public opinion (which hasn't happened, but hey, they tried). 

But the our retarded opposition has  boycotted almost very local election and because of that the ruling party has won in cities which could have easily been won by the opposition and that could have served as a way to gain popularity. In my city the opposition could have won, but they boycotted so thank them for leaving me hostage to the criminal whims and corruption of our ruling party for another 4 years.

3232,"I'm American so I may be ignorant on the Dutch / European home buying culture.  But in the U.S. the price you pay for a home is often a secondary consideration, what really matters is the *payment*.  After all, most people need a loan to make a purchase as large as a home.  In the U.S. our interest rates on mortgage loans were FAR higher in the 1980's and 1990's, they are only around 3% today.  So the actual *monthly housing expense* hasn't changed nearly as much as the value.  Likewise, how much of a salary is disposable, how inflation has changed expenses, how much taxes have changed and cost of common goods and necessities... all of these have changed.  So to do a truly fair comparison we must compare an adjusted version of salary v. monthly housing expense.

3268,"'Feel' is a key term here. Truth is much worse, I'd say, since during socialism things like education (not just secondary but tertiary education), healthcare and housing was accessible and very cheap if not free. Wages have gone up since though and priorities have shifted, so they **feel** that education hasn't been impacted negatively, even if it actually has been.

Standard of living makes sense, since larger variety of marginally better commodities is better perceived than a few provided by the workers of the state.

Pride makes sense too, since nationalism was heavily downplayed by the communist parties, and the rest as well.

However, when it comes to healthcare, that is something that will always matter to people, and it has received such little funding, that experts are emigrating, leaving behind surgeons who are either too inexperienced, unskilled or shouldn't be qualified under conditions where one could spare them.

It is a matter of private ownership now, the English sold their own rights, and those are now in the hands of multinationals. Not just foreign, but also their own billionaires. Those foreign companies and own billionaires will just keep on fishing, unless they step in and backtrack on property law.

So other then scoring some political points, a big portion of English fisheries are already bought and paid for by foreign entities. The fishing is really not worth arguing about. I doubt many politicians are actually serious about it, it is just a convenient issue to throw out some propaganda over, blame the other side and call it a day. And that is what both sides seem to really want.

This is the opinion of a user who has been very strongly against covid-related measures so take it with a grain of salt. It's a bit alarmist. Yes, people will be pissed off that there's going to be another lock-down during Christmas, yes, this government is headed by a clown and yes, they do have a bunch of other clowns in their parties, but they're not dismantling democracy by any stretch of the imagination.

If I was afforded the liberty to voice my opinion: were it not for covid-denying loonies who whine about their rights like some privileged kindergarteners and refuse gestures of basic human decency (wear the fucking mask when you're around others and get tested when you get the chance) there would be no need for such draconian measures.

For the record, I also disagree with the directionless and unscientific approach of our PM (he's the one pushing through most of the stuff, but luckily he's a clueless clown so I'm sure a lot of stuff is still pushed through by cleverer people than him), but the wave of arrests in the corrupt judiciary, police and prosecution is a very welcome development in our country and I'll be eagerly awaiting those court decisions from quarantine if need be. Once the vaccine is available, I'm pretty sure all of this will be behind us.

Also, just to illustrate the OP's level of delusion (although I agree with him/her on many other points), it's definitely not true the ruling coalition is left/center, if anything, its definitely right/center, and the main opposition is social democrats (and extremist loonies with no clear plan who I'll conveniently ignore).",,/r/europe/comments/kadhgz/democracy_in_slovakia_just_died/gfa2ysk/,PropOnTop,1607610123

No there won't be. If that was the case, North Korea would have had a revolution decades ago. There is simply no alternative to the CPC that is even remotely credible. 

If there was some slowdown in development, first you'd have to convince the people that it's solely due to the fault of the government, and not due to foreign intervention or disasters such as Corona. Then the slowdown has to be so massive that you can actually get some people together, and then you'd have to actually convince them that whatever you're planning would be a better solution. All of these are unlikely to occur.

This is also not even considering that fact that a replacement of the CPC would hardly be an improvement over the current situation. Or do you think that a democratic China (already making the assumption that a replacement government would be democratic in the first place, but whatever) would suddenly switch its entire foreign policy to please the West.

3572,"&gt;I'm not. You don't get to dismiss conservative ideas as mere ""feelings"" and yet assert (without evidence) that gender is a material objectively real thing. Feel free to provide that evidence.

No serious political commentator is saying that. Gender is a social construct (unlike sex) but a construct with real-world consequences.

I meant feeling as ""thin air"" if you're interested.

&gt;Ask that to the working class who didn't vote for him. My bet is that they believe he was prioritising those issues above their own.

In the dem primaries? No absolutely not.
Conservative attacks on him was mostly attacking his economic  ideas.

&gt;He has been in politics all of his life, and has 1 piece of legislation to show for it.

Do you deny that he was a huge part of making left-wing ideas part of mainstream US politics?

&gt;Fair enough - I'd argue that to a left-wing person a centre-left win is preferable to a centre-right win.


With climate change on the line? A bit better but not nearly enough.

&gt;1. we're the most adaptable species ever to exist - we permanently inhabit: deserts, frozen tundra, mountains, underwater (submarines), and even space. Humanity is not threatened by climate change.

Sure the richer nations will survive. How will you handle the enourmous amount of refugees from poorer countries? This is literally the Ben Shapiro meme.

My concern is about the billions of people who will get royally fucked over, seems heartless not to be.

&gt;technological progress is the only way to actually address climate change, and capitalism is the best system for technological progress. Nuclear power (fission and fusion), more efficient renewable generation, more efficient and effective ways of breaking down/reusing harmful by-products of industry, geo-engineering, carbon capture, etc.

We needed to make drastic changes yesterday. We haven't had time to wait for new tech for a while now. Capitalism has failed to adress this issue, I don't see how someone couldn't make that conclusion unless they're in deep denial.

&gt;Indeed, and expertly shows why Marxist theories are terrible ways of looking at the world. Choosing to judge the world based on just 1 category and ignoring all other relevant factors (e.g. class/gender) gives you an incorrect and terrible view of the world. Marxist theories also take away agency and free will from people: you are poor/female, ergo you must be a victim of the system, your choices don't matter.

Oh I certainly agree you won't get the complete picture using only one set of theoretical tools. For example: Marxist Feminists often combine marxist and feminist analysis to arrive at their conclusions.
You do seem to be very radical in your indivudualism, you do realise the goal is the reflect reality for most people not every single individual?

Would you agree socio-economic circumstances is a great predictor for the level of personal economic success someone will most likely achieve? 

Do you also think Marxism is terrible as a base for understanding history? If so, why?

&gt;I'm not saying this to be dismissive

Don't worry, I'm an ass all the time.

&gt;This is very simple: they face no issues of government. There are no laws denying them rights any others have. Sure they may face discrimination from individuals in society, but not from the government - ergo it is not a political problem. We are free to discriminate our personal interactions: who we befriend, who we sleep with, who we have children with, who we do business with, etc. If I don't want to do business with you or talk to you, it doesn't matter 

Having the option to choose is a privilege few people have. Power dynamics and the tool of social exclusion does affect groups and individuals in ways that have personal economic consequences. Things as simple as chilhood bullying and exclusion have proven to have consequences for bullied individuals later in life.

The **history of** [**York**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/York)  as a city dates to the beginning of the first millennium AD but  archaeological evidence for the presence of people in the region of York  dates back much further to between 8000 and 7000¬†BC. As York was a town  in [Roman times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire), its [Celtic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_languages) name is recorded in Roman sources (as *Eboracum* and *Eburacum*); after 400, [Angles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angles) took over the area and adapted the name by [folk etymology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_etymology) to [Old English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_English_language) *Eoforwƒ´c* or *Eoforƒ´c*, which means ""wild-boar town"" or ""rich in wild-boar"".

The cleverness of Diocletian's tetrarchy was that with a clear successor (his caesar), there was someone ready at the reins of power to find any assassin and take gruesome vengeance on them. If said designated successor got it into his head that he ought to accelerate the succession a bit, there was a colleague (the other augustus) with strong motivation to correct that successor in a lethal manner. The reason it failed was that first succession, where Diocletian's colleague was a) not really ready to retire and grow sallad, and b) wanted his son to succeed him.

did later on when Mario Draghi changed course of the ECB and save the euro by lowering interest rates for all countries.

3845,"Europe‚Äôs potential vulnerability to economic coercion increases as the euro becomes less relevant to international trade, and vice versa. For many European companies, losing access to US dollar markets means losing access to the international system of payments and trade. And the threat of market exclusion can make companies and policymakers vulnerable to blackmail. There are two underlying problems in this.

Firstly, Europeans too often discuss their monetary union and its reforms from an internal and technical perspective. They frequently fail to think about it from a geopolitical perspective ‚Äì with a view not to dominate but to protect themselves from the geostrategic actions of others. They cannot protect their values and interests, including their freedom to trade, with a euro that is overshadowed by foreign currencies.

Secondly, in the realm of digital currencies, Europe has fallen behind the United States and China. Usage of the euro may soon be less attractive for businesses as a result. Digitalisation will not automatically lead to a greater role for the euro in the world, but it is an essential precondition for it. Blockchain experts estimate that digital currencies will reduce transaction costs in international trade by 20-50 per cent once they are fully in place.

3860,"&gt;It just seems that (...)

And it just seems to me that you're hellbent on systematically misinterpreting what I'm saying here to make it fit the narrative you've decided to afix to my posts since we started discussing it.

I've repeatedly made the effort to clear it out for you, but in return you've been repeatedly twisting the substance of my posts, putting words in my mouth, severing them out of their broader context. 

I've repeatedly ellaborated on the parts you quite obviously misinterpreted, but you've been repeatedly pretending to know better than I do what I meant.

So at this point, this discussion is pretty much deadlocked.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;I (...) therefore completely welcome this French decision

As do I.

But as you keep missing my point, you still haven't understood that.

Did I claim there were alternative to conventional carriers? No, I didn't. I said those vessels were bound to become obsolete down the road.

But I never mentioned ""*soon*"", **you** came up with that term, and in this context, ""*soon*"" means several decades anyway. So *of course* it makes sense to keep building them for the time being. Nowhere in any of my posts did I state the opposite. **You** made up this narrative, on your own and out of nowhere, and freely attributed it to me.

Finally, the obsolescence those vessels are facing is not related to their inherent purpose, force projection, which isn't going anywhere. It's related to the aspect force projection is going to take decades from now, when are factored in the development of unmanned drones, the betterment of anti-ship weapons, and the cost-effectiveness expected from the successor of conventional carriers ; amongst other things.

&amp;nbsp;

Now, everything I've said since we started this is crystal clear, but that's assuming you're actually trying to understand it in good faith. 

If you just cannot acknowledge that you may have been mistaken, there simply isn't anything I could possibly say to clear this out any further.

3934,"First of all, read the flair. No I‚Äôm not American. And no, I don‚Äôt say, because MY government would be more transparent. Orb√°n is just as big of a crook as Putin, they have dismantled every independent institution in Hungary except for the courts, but not for lack of trying. I can see first hand, what is the result if healthcare is politicized. The second wave hit us like a truck, and they are hiding the true state of our hospitals, more than a hundred people die every day from COVID in our not even 10M country, and they try to paint the picture that every last one was either old or already sick.

What does America have to do with it? That‚Äôs the exact question I ask you back. Not 70 years back when Russia moved into Hungary crushing it with tanks, and they are coming back flaming our far-right and buying our government to sabotage the EU. It is a political game for them, and ordinary citizens are getting caught in the crossfire.

Let me tell you that independence and transparency regards to how an institution makes decisions. Like, your employer might pay your salary, but does that mean you are their slave, to do anything they ask? No. Transparency means you have a written job description, an expected salary and it is clear, who has to do what and what are the limits. Just because Johns Hopkins gets some of their funding from the government, doesn‚Äôt make them less transparent or independent, the decisions the institution makes are clear: who decides what and why, it is transparent. Like, the head of Johns Hopkins was not a political appointee. The CDC is falling under Trump, this wannabe fascist, Fauci have been close to being fired and replaced by someone more loyal, but they couldn‚Äôt see how to get away with it, they simply replaced him as advisers for Scott Atlas, who will say anything Trump wants to hear. The same happens here in Hungary, it‚Äôs just Orb√°n have already replaced the head of the Hungarian CDC before the pandemic, and she goes along with withholding vital information. Also he had an advisory board from the best scientist Hungary could offer, and now he shuns them since they wanted lockdowns as early as September. But even they didn‚Äôt get any memo if they will be needed, they just got gradually disregarded. Not even their own mayors get settlement level information that they would desperately need, or what portion of new cases are nosocomial for example. Now this is not transparency, and you cannot make good decisions like this.

Another layer of independence is that trials are run by an independent body of clinics and doctors not by the manufacturer themselves. And transparency in this case is that there is oversight in this regard by people not invested in a particular vaccine manufacturer, and that the trials are double and triple blind. I‚Äôm sure Gamaleya want to comply with this standard as well. It‚Äôs just the same shit Putin pulled Trump wanted to pull as well, to have a vaccine before November 3rd he can use for his reelection campaign, but the FDA and the CDC didn‚Äôt budge, because he has not got that kind of power neither directly nor informally. That is independence. It‚Äôs not perfect, but even political appointees can grow a conscience sometimes, if they see they won‚Äôt be able to get away with going along unscathed.

There were results published for both Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, and they are being peer reviewed as the data are coming in. We had no information of Sputnik V before Putin approved it. Also, even if Moderna got money from Operation Warp Speed, Pfizer did not, they have an outstanding conditional order from many governments, but no money beforehand.

If people at the EMA approve Sputnik V after reviewing it, then I‚Äôm ok with it. It‚Äôs just unlikely that will happen soon, not before Pfizer and Moderna that‚Äôs for sure, since they have already submitted their request.",Hungary,/r/europe/comments/k97u8s/how_the_european_and_us_vaccines_compare/gf8wcdc/,lynx655,1607574894

So for me it‚Äôs the opposite, the mRNA vaccine looks simpler and safer, since there is no chance it will interact with the nucleus and your genome, and they have to keep it cold exactly because it is very unstable, so it can not really have long term effects. As long as the mRNA strand stands, the ribosomes can pump out the antigen and only that, and then the RNA deteriorates and only the antigen is left behind. :)",Hungary,/r/europe/comments/k97u8s/how_the_european_and_us_vaccines_compare/gf8yuou/,lynx655,1607576546

I think it‚Äôs the typical italian ‚Äúvictim‚Äù way of thinking. You are the strongest european economy, and probably ignorant people put the blame of their bad political choices (that lead to the debt) on stronger countries like you. Italy has never gone bankrupt because our debt is internal, with the italians themselves (BOTs in which italians invested, less foreigners) so it doesn‚Äôt fall. But the debt is still high and the politicians have never had problems with giving high interests, expecially before of the crysis, to have consent.

That said, in germany (in the 80s) my parents were not served in two restaurants and festivals because they were italians (explicit) and my mother, in one of them, heard a group of old germans watching the scene and saying ‚Äúlittle italian traitors‚Äù or stuff like that. Her german was incredibly poor, but she was really good at english, so she went to the table and protested. They apologized, it turned out they knew italian because they had crossed all italy to rome by bike, and they had a dinner all together.

Also you germans are a bit different: i had a german neighbour who bathed outside in november, ate even the crusts of the cheese and was wealthy (former soldier for the US) but still lived ‚Äúin the nature‚Äù with the house full of stuff and eating outside even in winter.

3999,"I already mentioned it before, even though you are not American, when it comes to Russia, the conventional European stance ultimately boils down to ""America is protecting us from Russian tyranny"". Persistent questioning of a European that hates Russia will reach that conclusion. When it comes to Russia, you objectively view the United States as a country that respects independent institutions and transparency. If you're comparing the US to maybe Finland than you might criticize the US more in this area, but with Russia, no. I'm not here to defend all their actions especially 70 years ago. As for what they are doing in Hungary now, the citizens of Hungary need to address the problem just like they did 70 years ago, even though it failed. But they still took action. 

I personally don't think that is what transparency means. If I am at a job and my boss asks me to do something that I think is morally wrong and tells me not to reveal that secret, then that is not being transparent. I can have my salary and a clear job description, but the actual job itself can be shrouded in secrecy, opposite of transparency. In the case of Fauci, he is just one person. He is the head of the COVID task force but there are thousands of people working hard in the CDC, so even if he is replaced, the scientists and doctors will not stop their work. And people have been claiming the CDC is failing for so many years now, especially during the Ebola outbreak in 2014. People were hammering the CDC back then. So I don't really consider those kinds of claims. 

On the issue of independence, I was using the financial standard of ""independent from the government"". That is what I have been taught growing up in America. Independent media is supposedly media not owned by the government. Independent oil companies are not owned by the government. Independent universities likewise. So I was assuming when people say Russia hates independent institutions, it's because their government funds much of them. And my response to that, specific to COVID, was that America (again, even though you're not American, you roughly align yourself with them compared to Russia) funds many of their institutions thus making them not ""independent"". But if you're talking about independent from Trump, then I guess you're right. 

I believe it was the British medical journal ""Lancet"" that peer reviewed the Sputnik vaccines. And many countries, including Israel, have already received it for clinical testing. If Russia was hell bent on not being transparent, they wouldn't give these vaccines for testing. 

The whole point of my original comment was in reply to another comment regarding Russia. I am just telling people what they already believe. ""Russia bad, end of story"". You don't believe Russia has independent and transparent institutions? What is the reason? The reason is the same, ""because Russia bad"". And I don't care about Putin, he's bade But when someone keeps on saying that, they internally view America is a righteous noble country, and that is what made me reply.",,/r/europe/comments/k97u8s/how_the_european_and_us_vaccines_compare/gf90g1i/,RiceFar,1607577666

&gt; **Lord Ashcroft's election day poll of 12,369 voters also discovered that 'One third (33%) [of leave voters] said the main reason was that leaving ""offered the best chance for the UK to regain control over immigration and its own borders.""**

&gt; **According to The Economist, areas that saw increases of over 200% in foreign-born population between 2001 and 2014 saw a majority of voters back leave in 94% of cases.**

&gt; **Immediately prior to the referendum, data from Ipsos MORI showed that immigration/migration was the most cited issue when Britons were asked 'What do you see as the most/other important issue facing Britain today?', with 48% of respondents mentioning it when surveyed**

&gt;  **'High numbers of migrants don't bother Britons; high rates of change do.' Consistent with that notion, research suggests that areas that saw significant influx of migration from Eastern Europe following the accession of 12 mainly Eastern European countries to the European Union in 2004 saw significant growth in support for UKIP and more likely to vote to leave the European Union. Academic research investigating differences in Brexit vote among local authorities concluded that the Brexit vote was bigger in areas that had seen a large rise in the proportion of immigrants between 2004 and 2011.**

i mean there is tons and tons of proof, but you wont believe it either way, or you do and you cant face the reality that your brand of xenophobia is the same one that targeted EE migrants in the UK and was the driving force behind Brexit.

immigration from outside of the EU can be controlled to zero, immigration from within the EU cannot be capped or controlled. we couldnt stop a pole from immigrating here, now we can. simple as that.

This has only recently changed a bit, in no small part as a consequence of Brexit. I guess, the German government has realized that the long-term surivival of the EU is no longer a given (especially considering that the current crisis has the potential of causing an Italian sovereign debt crisis with all its systemic risks for the whole Euro zone) and it has to do more to keep the union together, since the costs of a breakup would far exceed those of more financial support for particularly hard hit countries like Italy.

My understanding is that without a waiver, the best India can do is apply for compulsory licensing (which takes time, and can be rejected), and then import the vaccine from states that have access to it, or by ordering it through, let's say, Pfizer, who has a limited capacity to manufacture vaccines.

Short of Pfizer opening up a lab in India, or granting a license to one of India's pharmaceutical companies, vaccines will not be manufactured in India. -that's my take on it.

HMS Prince of Wales is powered using an Integrated Electric Propulsion configuration, with 2 Gas Turbines and 4 Diesel Generators, which produce High Voltage (11kV) electricity to power everything from propulsion to radars, to hotel services. So the RN, quite rightly don't to take any chances when an aspect of this has suffered water damage.

The Queen Elizabeth Class have 364,000 metres of pipework, with a lot of this under high pressure (8 bar). Some of this pipework is now approaching 10 years old and will have weak points, especially at joints

So whilst this isn't great, unfortunately it's one of the hazards that any warship (edit indeed any ship) can expect to face. It's certainly not unique to the Royal Navy and doesn't reflect on the build quality, the sailors or the ship itself.

4200,"All I am saying is that there is no Eastern Roman Empire during the reing of Justinian I (the Great), since that nomenclature and political division had ceased to exist for more than half a century, and at that point it was the sole Roman Empire, with a sole Roman Emperor and Roman Senate (the one in New Rome). 

As for me, because you are asking, being a Greek is essentially synonymous with being a Roman, so I would call myself a Roman. And that more than a Macedonian, especially since I have no direct ties to the region of Macedonia, albeit I am also Dorian, who Dorians were kinsmen of the Macedonians as fellow Northern Greeks. Not to say how the Roman Identity has gained the same meaning with the Greek one, and is still alive today, while that of the Macedonian Greek is only a subgroup, of a regional people and a historical people, and in no way exists politically. 

This synonymity of the term Greek and Roman stems, in my opinion from the fact that as attested, directly of indirectly by 30 ancient scholars, initially Rome was merely a Greek colony, and while it was founded as a city and statehood with no nationalistic vision, based on citizenship and not ethnicity, for what they were scorned by other Greeks (like the Albanian Latins), their state always attempted to assimilate the foreigners in their own culture. And while they had become alienated from other Greeks, slowly barbarized and italianized by the indigenous, they still retained their identity, and then slowly began a process of (re)hellenization. Eventually, they would unite all the Greek World in one single political entity, with many Greek allies peacefully submitting to them, or even Greek kings leaving their realms to Rome in their death wills (Bythinia, Pergamum, Cyrene, Egypt), thus ending the eternal kinstrife of the Greeks based on localistic differences. 

Hence, the Romans became Greeks (if they were not, contrary to what they themselves said) and the Greeks became Romans, accepting them not as Barbarians (Non-Greeks), but fellow compatriots. In fact, in instances that the Greeks of Greece did so, the Romans would be infuriated and explain them how this is wrong (there are instances they went to war over such denial of their Greekness). While the term Roman also included the many other nations, those were Romanized, which was the same thing like Hellenization, and both entities were considered as one and the same. Of course this became even more and more prevalent with the shrinking of the Roman Empire to the area of Greek majority. Just think that if during Justinian's reign, before the liberational wars in Africa and Italy, there were 30 million Roman Citizens, and out of them in the very least about 20 million Roman Greeks, based on the Synecdemus of Hierocles, in 530 AD, how much this percentage must have risen when Africa, Egypt and the Syropalestine was lost to the Arabian Invasions!... 

And of course this Roman Identity did not erase that of the Greekness of the Roman Greeks, who would remember both the Romans and the Greeks of Greece, as their ancestors, and would try to imitate them and surpass them. Hence, the Hellenes and the Romanoi were the ancestors of the Rhomaioi, who in the recent centuries are mostly known as Rhomioi, a name used even today in Greece, despite the more predominant usage of the term Hellenes again (which was never put out of use).",,/r/europe/comments/k9yn30/roman_byzantium_linguistic_divisions_during_the/gf7qsox/,Lothronion,1607551872

4277,"&gt; This is exactly the matter at hand. How do you determine what the damage caused was? With nuclear accidents, looking objectively and scientifically at them shows that the damage caused (directly by the accident) is little to none. Certainly less than what any fossil fueled power plant causes normally without any accidents.
&gt; 
&gt; However, you can then have say half a million people who voluntarily - or via government suggestion - fled their homes to run away from nothing, and then incurred damages via their self-harming actions, which will all sue the power plant or whoever they can to recover those damages.
&gt; 
&gt; Should insurance cover that? If a member of the public believes their life is at risk and thus self-harms, is the nuclear power plant responsible?

Yes, since those are normal actions when confronted with a danger of unknown severity. Unless you can predict *exactly* when and how and how severely an accident affects the environs, Captain Hindsight.

Literally in the source I provided: ""It is important to remember that this data represents a snapshot of language learning in one year ‚Äì 2017 ‚Äì rather than a student‚Äôs language exposure over the full course of their academic career. For instance, while the Netherlands ranks toward the bottom in terms of all students learning English in 2017, this is driven in part by lower proportions of Dutch primary students enrolled in language classes. While only about four-in-ten primary students are enrolled in a language course, nearly all of those students in a language class are already learning English in the classroom. Foreign language classes are not mandated in the Netherlands for students until age 10, one of the later ages in the EU.""

The reasoning given for this? They relayed information from AlarmPhone to the Greek coastguard (informing the Coastguard of the positions of boats) and if the coastguard did not react, they posted the location on social media. That seems to be all evidence/reasons according to [FRA](https://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra_uploads/fra-2020-migration-bulletin-4_en.pdf), the European Agency regarding fundamental rights.

You can do well in your life and still think that politicians are not be trusted, cause that is just the mainstream opinion. I think this is quite common in post-communist countries that there is a very low trust in the domestic politics, because of the turbulent transformation of the 90s.

The difference just is that Czechs don't trust foreign politics either. Defying foreign overlords and being betrayed by our allies is kinda the main narrative in our history. West betrayed us, Russia ruined us economically and socially, Germans/Austrians tried to germanize is for centuries, we don't really have a clear good foreign guy in our historical narratives.

Lots of people here also have a small country-isolationist mentality, i.e. everyone leave us alone, we can manage here on our own.

4501,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Bolshevism

&gt;Jewish Bolshevism, also Judeo‚ÄìBolshevism, is an anti-communist and antisemitic canard, which alleges that the Jews were the originators of the Russian Revolution in 1917, and that they held primary power among the Bolsheviks who led the revolution. Similarly, the conspiracy theory of Jewish Communism alleges that Jews have dominated the Communist movements in the world, and is related to the Zionist Occupation Government conspiracy theory (ZOG), which alleges that Jews control world politics.[1]
&gt;
&gt;In 1917, after the Russian Revolution, the antisemitic canard was the title of the pamphlet The Jewish Bolshevism, which featured in the racist propaganda of the anti-communist White movement forces during the Russian Civil War (1918‚Äì1922). During the 1930s, the Nazi Party in Germany and the German American Bund in the United States propagated the antisemitic theory to their followers, sympathisers, and fellow travellers.

Not really surprising. People like go on about Islam, and not without reason, but Christian conservatives can be pretty extreme too.

For example, the ottomans decriminalised gay sex over a hundred years before the UK. Obviously, homophobia is a big problem among muslims, but it's not as if a nominally christian country was that much better until quite recently. IRC Abortion law is now more liberal in Iran than it is in Poland. Quite something if you're more conservative than a literal islamic theocracy.

TLDR It's a mistake to think European countries are more progressive because they're christian. Plenty are progressive *despite* being christian. Like France. Most progress in France was achieved despite the catholic church, not because it was super tolerant.

Or anti-vaccination. Popular in muslim countries, but also among christian conservatives who don't believe in thwarting God's will or some or other nonsense.

4630,"I knew a old Priest. You know the type. Kind, gentle, unjudgemental. That rare 1 in a million breed that embodies what people think a priest *should* be like, instead of how they all to often are.

He had that Albus Dumbdore quality: Not just old but actually ancient.
And he was so old he had absolutly no fucks left to give about filtering what he thought of the higher ups in the church and the young men straight from the seminary full of traditionalist dogma and classical theology and know lived experience of people's ordinary messy human lives.

It's a peculiarity in the church (at least in my country), probably to do with how they train them, that the younger priests, full of Zeal and book learnt theology are oftimes more critical and traditionalist. Whilst the ones who have been around the block a few times and actually done the job for a few decades are far more flexible and open to new ideas and interpretations, and the changing world. The younger chaps still acted like they were under Seige. A church under attack from a secular hostile world instead of going out and living in it. It's where the people are after all.

Anyway, this Priest, I recall, once invited some of the laity to speak on some issue. I think it was a charity drive or something. And one of the young mothers spoke, for a conaiderable time. And it was impressive. Charismatic. Moving. And afterwards, he paused. And then thanked her. And then thanked her for ""demonstrating once again, the ridiculousness of refusing to admit women to the priesthood in the twentieth century."" Had a chat at the end, and it was astonishingly palpable that he had no truck with the church's position on women priests, clerical celibacy, or the way things were ran.

He died about a decade after... Only funeral for a clergyman I've ever witnessed. And he was clearly well respected because they pulled out all the stops. Barely room by the altar for all the priests officiating.

But I still think about him. I think quite strongly there was a part of him that regretted joining the priesthood, from the way he talked about it. He wanted a family. He wanted children and a wife and to be part of the community. He didn't want to give up his job to do it though and it clearly hurt him.

I don't think be ever lost his faith in God. Though he did cover the subject of doubt quite a bit in his sermons. I rather suspect he'd lost his faith in the church though... or at least in ""Senior Mangement"" (My Catholic Mothers rather unflattering nickname for the Bishops and Cardinals).

I can't imagine him ever willingly leaving the church though... He did too much good there. And when you've done the same job for 70 years, I suppose it's a little late to back out.",,/r/europe/comments/k9axff/percentage_of_population_absolutely_certain_god/gf62woy/,Kenobi_01,1607523408

4633,"To be honest, life expectancy is more or less the same in all of European countries, the differences are minimal. See for example  https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/life-expectancy-at-birth-including-the-un-projections?tab=chart&amp;stackMode=absolute&amp;country=FRA-0~DEU-0~ITA-0~ESP-0~GBR-0&amp;region=World

However, I suggest a few relevant points
1) life expectancy is not necessarily the same as quality of life. We could live the same quantity of years, but the advantages and disadvantages of each country could very well compensate each other. A spanish citizen could live longer due to better diet and climate maybe, while a citizen in Norway has access to better healthcare to compensate for harsher winters. That doesn't mean that they are equally happy or satisfied. It depends a lot on individual factors. 
2) look also at other indicators. Italy is one of the 2 or 3 worst countries in Europe on any fair comparison: unemployment, birthrates, low education levels, corruption, human rights violations, lowest economic growth, organized crime, freedom of speech, public debt, etc. Life expectancy is good, but it seems the exception unfortunately. 
3) in particular, look at one particular benchamrk which I consider interesting: migration. The youngest and brightest are escaping en masse from Italy. That alone is the worst symptom, IMO, that they are finding elsewhere their happiness. The number of expats is growing, now is nearly 200.000 per year. A country which offers no future to its children is declining, not happy! If the fertility rate is already as low as 1.3 (vs a replacement rate of 2.1), what will be in 10 years from now, with a million young couples less than today? It's a nightmare, really.

But in the end, I think there is no need to argue on that. Everybody is free to look for happiness wherever he/she prefers. If you are looking for a long life , you are welcome to try our lifestyle.",,/r/europe/comments/k9lt37/december_in_trastevere_rome/gf62xqt/,usaegetta2,1607523425

Romanian is an ethnicity. Nationality has 0 importance here. A piece of paper that makes you the citizen of 1 country or another doesn't change a person's ethnic identity.

Being Romanian means a lot more than having Romanian citizenship, it means being part of a group of people with a shared heritage, culture and language. The same is true of every other ethnic group.

I guess you may be from the USA or Canada so I'll try to explain it in a way that you'll hopefully understand.

Essentially, anyone can be American, Canadian, etc. because those aren't ethnicities and the countries weren't formed around an ethnic identity. The same is not true for Romania and pretty much near all other European countries who were almost all formed around specific ethnic identities.

If ethnic identities were less important than nationalities then countries such as the USSR, Yugoslavia, the Ottoman Empire and Austro-Hungary would still exist today instead of having dissolved into several countries.",,/r/europe/comments/k9qc2l/champions_league_match_suspended_after_romanian/gf63jdf/,Areishia,1607523774

Alrgiht, let's go. What the Pfizer's history will tell us:

&gt;Pfizer has faced thousands of lawsuits filed for medical injuries caused by some of its most popular drugs. It has also set a record for the largest fine paid for a health care fraud lawsuit filed by the U.S. Department of Justice. Pfizer paid $2.3 billion in fines, penalties, and settlement for illegal marketing claims.

Their hormone drug has caused thousands of breast cancer cases.

&gt;[Nearly 10,000 Prempro lawsuits were filed by women who had been diagnosed with breast cancer. The lawsuits were largely settled by 2012 for about $1 billion.](https://www.nationalconsumerlawyers.com/hrt/prempro-lawsuits/)

They killed more than fifty children in their one experiment on new drugs.

&gt;[ Pfizer representatives and personnel from a contract research organization (CRO) traveled to Kano, Nigeria to set up a clinical trial and administer an experimental antibiotic, trovafloxacin, to approximately 200 children. Local Kano officials report that more than 50 children died in the experiment, while many others developed mental and physical deformities.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdullahi_v._Pfizer,_Inc.)

And yet they actively pour money into politics and lobby for their own interests above the interests of people and their health.

&gt;According to U.S. State Department cables released by the whistleblower site WikiLeaks, Pfizer ""lobbied against New Zealand getting a free trade agreement with the United States because it objected to New Zealand's restrictive drug buying rules and tried to get rid of New Zealand's former health minister, Helen Clark, in 1990.

The issues of comparability that exist are due to AstraZeneca/Oxford conducting a more sloppy trial, with an ad-hoc a-posteriori approved change to the dosing regime, that was ultimately applied to a statistically non-representative sub-set of volunteers (no old people, smaller number).

4796,"This comment on r/soccee present the situation perfectly,  is clear that you are just nitpicking rn without understanding the situation or the contex



&gt;\^ This. (Context: I speak Romanian fluently). On the one hand, yes, Romania has basically no history of trading or exploiting black slaves, so the word has no negative connotation in Romanian, or in any case, no more negative than its speaker intends it to be. I'm pretty sure the ref didn't mean it in a derogatory sense. (It's non-derogatory enough that ""Negru"" and its variations -- ""NegrilƒÉ"", ""Negrescu"" and so on -- are pretty common family names among ethnic Romanians. Edit: also, I'm specifically saying ""no history of trading or exploiting *black* slaves"" because Romanian history is definitely not devoid of slavery).  
&gt;  
&gt;On the other hand football is an international game. People from all backgrounds, all races, and all cultures are part of it. *Especially* when you're refereeing, you're supposed to know and understand and respect these things. Being singled out as ""the black guy"" has a very hurtful cultural connotation for some people -- the fact that it was done in a language where the word itself is harmless makes no difference.  
&gt;  
&gt;Edit: there are a few things that popped up in the comments below and I want to clear 'em up before this devolves into even more of a flamewar than it already is, and before this post gets archived.  
&gt;  
&gt;First, [/u/ballaedd24](https://www.reddit.com/u/ballaedd24/) has been downvoted to hell for taking issue with something from my post, and I'm pretty sure I could've replied more kindly, too, so let me clarify it here: when I say the word has a meaning that's ""no more negative than its speakers intends it to be"", I mean only that it's not a racial slur. It *is* used to refer to race, just not in an inherently negative way, the way the n-word would be used in English.  
&gt;  
&gt;Second: while Romanian culture does not have a tradition of discriminating against people of African descent, I think that, as I mentioned in another post, a Romanian referee should have been more sensitive to this if only because, while most Europeans would say ""the Romanian one"" about someone and mean nothing else but that they're from Romania, some of them would use it to imply some other things as well.  
&gt;  
&gt;My Romanian friends might not be able to relate, specifically, to the concept of ""white guilt"" because their grandfathers didn't own black slaves, but I am convinced they can all relate to the *concept* of being singled out for something. Having spoken Romanian in all sorts of places where people don't have a good opinion about Eastern Europeans, I can sure as hell understand why someone would take offense at being singled out based on race or ethnicity. So ""his culture doesn't have that term"" is very much a moot point, it absolutely does, and I bet he was at the receiving end of it more than once, too.  
&gt;  
&gt;THIRD: To everyone saying ""but how else was he supposed to identify him???""  
&gt;  
&gt;Back when the Busby Babes were beating everyone (guess why I'm butthurt *tonight*) it was pretty common for every player on the pitch to be white. If the refs were creative enough to precisely identify someone under *those* circumstances, I find it very hard to believe that there was no other way to identify a player except by his skin color. A few plausible alternatives include ""the one to my left/right"", ""the one I'm pointing at"" and ""-- What's you name, sir? -- Webo -- WEBO!""",Romania,/r/europe/comments/k9qc2l/champions_league_match_suspended_after_romanian/gf5t8of/,TheGodTachanka,1607516713

4849,"As far as I am aware there are some really big question marks when it comes to the Russian vaccine, and also the Oxford vaccine.

The Russian one just basically boils down to the fact that they have been cagey with the trial results and the Russian governments hype of the vaccine is considered untrustworthy.

The Oxford vaccine is because of the fact that the stage 3 trials were conducted a bit weird with regards to how they chose participants, how they processed data, and especially with how they decided dosages. That is why there is such a  large window of 60-90% effectivity. Apparently it is more effective at smaller doses, something they didn‚Äôt really test for that much in their trials. This is counterintuitive, but it can definitely be true.

On paper the oxford vaccine is the easiest, cheapest, and one of the most effective vaccines. But the trials need to be looked at closer.

4857,"With Bulgaria's joining the Eurozone approaching, I have started thinking about what should the national sides of the coins hold. All existing Eurozone members have to follow the design guidelines and Bulgaria' sharing Greece and Cyrprus's unique position as members with their own alphabet, I opted to design national sides, not only holding symbols of Bulgaria's history, but translaing the coinage's value in Bulgarian.

The Greek coinage calles the euro cents "" ŒªŒµœÄœÑŒ¨ "" (lepta). Likewise, the word ""cent"" in Bulgarian is ""—Å—Ç–æ—Ç–∏–Ω–∫–∞"" (stotinka), so on all cent coins I've placed this word, thus preserving the Bulgarian word and following the provisions of the Lisbon Treaty, allowing member states to apply their language's norms on the names of the euro. The front side has it in Latin script. The mint symbol is the logo of the [Bulgarian National Bank](https://www.debtagency.bg/images/bnb-logo.jpg).

**Now, for the symbolism**

**2 euro**  
The national side features the face of Paisiy Hilendarski - the monk who wrote Istoriya Slavyanobolgarska - the book that arguably ignited the Bulgarian Revival in the 1700s and led to the Liberation of Bulgaria in 1878. Hilendarski is currently on the [2 leva coin](https://webnews.bg/uploads/images/62/5762/175762/orig.jpg?_=1446867211).

The coin has the portrait of Paisiy Hilendarski, the incription ""2 –ï–í–†–û"" in Bulgarian, meaning 2 euro and the mint symbol.

**1 euro**  
The national side features St Ivan Rilski - the patron saint of Bulgaria. He is the namesake of the Rila monastery - ne of the most holiest places in Bulgaria. Ivan Rilski is currently on the [1 lev coin](https://newsline.bg/upload/98871_lev.jpg).

The coin has a copy of an icon of St Ivan Rilski, the incription ""1 –ï–í–†–û"" in Bulgarian, meaning 1 euro and the mint symbol and the text –ë–™–õ–ì–ê–†–°–ö–ê –ù–ê–†–û–î–ù–ê –ë–ê–ù–ö–ê - Bulgarian National Bank and the mint symbol.

**50 stotinki (cents)**  
The national side features the Madara rider - a pre-Christian iconic symbol, made by Bulgar nobility after the establishment of the Bulgarian Khanate in 681. The symbol is currently on all [stotinki coinage](https://i.colnect.net/f/6197/279/1-Stotinka-not-magnetic-back.jpg).

The coin has the Madara rider, the inscription ""50 –°–¢–û–¢–ò–ù–ö–ò"" (50 stotinki) and the mint symbol.

**20 stotinki (cents)**  
The national side features the image of Sebastocratoress Desislava - one of the most influential Medieval Bulgarian noble. She's famous for being the sponsor of the BOyana church - an UNESCO world-heritage site and one of the few surviving examples of ""Renaissance Pal√©ologue"" art. Desislava was on the [20 leva note](https://www.numiscollection.com/upload/image/bulgaria-20-leva-dutchess-s-ortiza-desislava---church-p-image-61552-grande.jpg) in the late 90s before the series was discontinued after the hyperinflation of 1997.

The coin has the image of Desislava in front of the Boyana church, the inscription ""20 –°–¢–û–¢–ò–ù–ö–ò"" (20 stotinki) and the mint symbol.

**10 stotinki (cents)**  
The national side features the Cyrillic alphabet, commissioned by Tsar Simeon I the Great to replace the Glagolitic script, introduced by the brother saints Cyrill and Methodius.

The coin depicts the alphabet as a ring, surrounding the inscription ""10 –°–¢–û–¢–ò–ù–ö–ò"" (10 stotinki) and the mint symbol.

**5 stotinki (cents)**  
The national side features the image of a Thracian princess, as depicted on the dome of the Kazanlak tomb - a burial site of the Thracian ruler Roygos. The tomb is an UNESCO world heritage site.

The coin depicts the princess seated in her throne and the inscription ""5 –°–¢–û–¢–ò–ù–ö–ò"" (5 stotinki) and the mint symbol.

**2 stotinki (cents)**  
The national side features the heraldic lion on a shiled and crown as depicted on the [100 golden leva](https://blog.fibank.bg/app/web/upload/tinymce-source/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/100-%D0%BB%D0%B2.1894.jpg) coin of the Third Bulgarian Tsardom. The heraldic lion is rampant in a crowned shiled and was the inspiration of the current coat of arms of Bulgaria.

The coin depicts the shiels and crown and the inscription ""2 –°–¢–û–¢–ò–ù–ö–ò"" (2 stotinki) and the mint symbol.

**1 stotinka (cent)**  
The national side features the Pliska rosette - a pagan charm, found in the first capital of the Bulgarian Khanate Pliska. It is a seven-pointed star with inscriptions in a script, used by the Bulgars.

The coin depicts the rosette and the mint symbol in its center. Due to the size of the coin and the ever-more likely discontinuation of the 1 cent coin all over the Eurozone, I opted to exclude inscriptions.",,/r/europe/comments/k9p48q/what_i_think_should_be_on_the_bulgarian_euro/gf5lh44/,gerginborisov,1607509085

Can't say I'm surprised that catholic is not only is a filthy liar but also makes everything about himself and his religion.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;In 1987, following the adoption of the flag by the EC, Ars√®ne Heitz  (1908‚Äì1989), one of the designers who had submitted proposals for the  flag's design, suggested a religious inspiration for it. He claimed that  the circle of stars was based on the iconographic tradition of showing  the Blessed Virgin Mary as the Woman of the Apocalypse, wearing a ""crown of twelve stars""  
&gt;  
&gt;(...)  
&gt;  
&gt;Paul M. G. L√©vy, then Director of Information at the Council of Europe responsible for designing the flag, in a 1989 statement maintained that he had not been aware of any religious connotations.  
&gt;  
&gt;In an interview given 26 February 1998, L√©vy denied not only awareness of the ""Marian"" connection, but also denied that the final design of a circle of twelve stars was Heitz's. To the question ""Who really designed the flag?"" L√©vy replied:  
&gt;  
&gt;""I did, and I calculated the proportions to be used for the geometric design. Ars√®ne Heitz, who was an employee in the mail service, put in all sorts of proposals, including the 15-star design. But he submitted too many designs. He wanted to do the European currencies with 15 stars in the corner. He wanted to do national flags incorporating the Council of Europe flag.""

They actually say it in the Lancet article themselves. It may be due to chance.

""Efficacy of 90¬∑0% seen in those who received a low dose as prime in the UK was intriguingly high compared with the other findings in the study. Although there is a possibility that chance might play a part in such divergent results, a similar contrast in efficacy between the LD/SD and SD/SD recipients with asymptomatic infections provides support for the observation (58¬∑9% [95% CI 1¬∑0 to 82¬∑9] vs 3¬∑8% [‚àí72¬∑4 to 46¬∑3]).""

After you the guy who posted this article assumed, for some inexplicable reason, that the words ""enemy"" and ""attack"" imply a direct attack on French soil to the exclusion of *any* other type conflict that France might be obliged to get involved in.

I can't speak for the guy who started this thread critiquing the French strategy, but considering he's been online hours after this conversation started and hasn't corrected me, and the topic of this thread is a fucking aircraft carrier ..... I think it's a safe assumption the strategy he's referring to regards the likely situations a carrier might be deployed to handle and not some cold war fantasy where France is existentially threatened.

5208,"&gt; Regarding their survivability, what happened during the Millenium Challenge 2002
&gt;  is a testimony of how unsuited to not-so-modern warfare those vessels are. After the fleet suffered devastating losses on the first day, the exercice was modified to follow a script, effectively restricting what the attacking team could do, in order to artificially validate the US carrier doctrine of the time. And this was 20 years ago already.

The initial run of MC02 was a fuck up and anyone who looks to it as educative example or buys into the scripting narrative bullshit is someone hasn't done the slightest research into what the purpose of the exercise actually was and why it had to be redone beyond skimming a Wikipedia page sourced entirely from articles written by people who have zero knowledge of military matters.

MC02 was about predicting enemy behaviors, specifically their intelligence gathering capabilities and high level decision making. In addition to the logistics and communication issues of commanding large naval, air and amphibious forces.

It had nothing to do with testing the ""survivability"" of carriers or any other ship. It wasn't supposed to be an accurate tactical simulation of navel combat, it couldn't be. No weapons were firing and ships were barely maneuvering, it was all done on paper/computer. Which is why absurdities in the tactical aspects of the simulation like teleporting bike messengers and anti-ship missiles bigger then the boats supposed to be carrying them were not the fundamental problem with the initial run ..... because we already know anti-ship missiles *can* in fact disable ships, and we don't have perfect knowledge of all our foe's capabilities in any case.

The problem is the commander of red team, Von Ripper, made an asinine assumption about blue teams actions/movements, partially based on faulty modeling and partially on account of his own arrogance as demonstrated by his media tour afterwards, and responded in a way that completely botched the initial run, forcing them to restart.

As per the circumstances of the simulation red team threatened to close a strategically important straight and when it began blue team had just started marshaling their forces in the region in a process that was expected to take two weeks when they communicated an ultimatum for red team to abandon their stated objectives and allow passage through the straight. 

This was done in the assumption that red team would likely not respond at all or begin mining the straight, in which case blue team would likely begin limited attacks via aircraft and the vessels they already had in stand off range. In any case blue team likely had several more days at least before any larger action was undertaken or even an attempted transit of the straight to test red teams resolve assuming minelayers didn't get to work immediately.

**Von Ripper interpreted the ultimatum as a declaration of war and the demand to be allowed through meant the entire blue team fleet was in the straight *at that exact moment*.** He ordered an all out attack and predictably destroyed a simulated fleet that was bunched up within visual range while blue team, not knowing any of this was happening, was commanding a simulated fleet dispersed hundreds of miles at sea and a bunch of marines were scratching their asses on ships just off an isolated stretch of beach waiting for their part to begin, also not aware Von Ripper was attacking their simulated ships. 

The only restrictions they put on red team was for their commander to not be so retarded as to think that when the simulation went live and he saw systems erroneously indicating enemy ships, including ones that were still in route half way around the world at that point, were in position for an amphibious landing on day one of the simulation with no proceeding air attacks and no clear declaration of war. 

The correct course of action was to stop the exercise and find a fix or workaround for the obvious problems in computer modeling before starting again. Instead he attacked, ruining the goals of the exercise and potentially wasting an enormous amount of time and money including all the ships, aircraft and personnel committed for the next two weeks if they didn't restart. Than he got ass-hurt when this was painted out to him and over the years has wasted no opportunity to shift the blame.",,/r/europe/comments/k97mim/the_aircraft_carrier_charles_de_gaulle_will_have/gf4iafa/,76DJ51A,1607480078

Again, the roof simply doesn't float over there, especially a timber and marble one, you'd have to recreate the full interior, restore the fire damaged surfaces and the lintel over the west doorway, recreate the entirety of the eastern doorway, and the four ionic columns of the opisthidomos from nothing and the two story colonnade of the interior out of twenty or so fragments. And putting new weight on the ancient members **will** damage them to some degree.

&gt; The conservators are notoriously conservative. [Venice Charter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice_Charter) has been essentially static since its inception. Its centerpoint is an aggressive anti-reconstruction approach, often to the detriment of the state of the monument or historical environment. It has been quite significantly criticized, even though it remains a Bible for the academia in historical conservation.

They are conservative because previous restorations that were considered the height of technology at the time, like the one on the beginning of the 20th century fucked up even the undamaged parts of the monument.

5354,"Conventional fighter carriers are on the verge of becoming obsolete anyway.

With the neverending betterment of anti-ship missile technology on one hand, and the rise of unmanned drones and lighter carriers on the other, they're predicted to suffer the same fate as battleships in the coming decades. 

As of 2020, they're little more than token ships, and are only used as expensive force projection platforms in low-intensity conflicts.

- Regarding their force projection capabilities, ligther and cheaper multipurpose intervention carriers such as the [Mistral-class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mistral-class_amphibious_assault_ship) are more adapted to the kind of asymmetric warfare France has been, is, and will remain involved in, in the foreseeable future. Further down the road, drone carriers will complement that kind of ships, effectively sounding the death knell for conventional carriers.

- Regarding their survivability, what happened during the [Millenium Challenge 2002](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Challenge_2002) is a testimony of how unsuited to not-so-modern warfare those vessels are. After the fleet suffered devastating losses on the first day, the exercice was modified to follow a script, effectively restricting what the attacking team could do, in order to artificially validate the US carrier doctrine of the time. And this was 20 years ago already.

So overall, building two of them in this context seems just like a ridiculous waste of resources, which can be more aptly used elsewhere in the French military.

&amp;nbsp;

Furthermore, [the French doctrine](https://www.defense.gouv.fr/content/download/215253/2394121/file/White%20paper%20on%20defense%20%202013.pdf) has moved on since the Cold War, the operational availability of that kind of vessels is now factored in the multiple defense agreements France has -- chiefly NATO, the EU and the UK.

&gt;In this framework, France must be able to deploy the following resources, together with the associated command and support functions: 
&gt;
&gt;(...)
&gt;
&gt;- the aircraft carrier, two combined force projection and command vessels (BPC), a key core of national escort vessels comprised primarily of frigates, a nuclear attack submarine and naval patrol aircraft. **The permanence of this joint air and sea capability could be assured by the Anglo-French joint expeditionary force provided for by the Lancaster House agreements**;

(...)

&gt;This period of sharp budget contraction in all the European countries should be seized as an opportunity to organise **mutually agreed capability interdependencies**. For existing capabilities or those currently being acquired, France firmly intends to engage in the pooling and sharing initiative adopted by Defence ministers of the European Union in 2010.

https://global.ctbuh.org/resources/papers/download/1293-tall-buildings-in-the-netherlands-constraints-to-innovation.pdf

&gt; The  actual  study  found,  nevertheless, some  reasons  why  the  willingness  of  contractors  to  be innovative in the design stage is still limited:
&gt;
&gt; 1.The  Dutch  building  regulations  are  applicable for  buildings  up  to  only  70  meters  high.  For taller  buildings,  the  conditions  for  a  building permit   must   be   negotiated   with   the   local authorities. Each community has its own officers with  their  own  vision.  Often,  some  courage  is needed  to  give  an  innovative  action  a  chance. Contractors are more likely to accept any risk in this  respect  than  civil  servants  are.  As  a  result, there is no certainty about what will be accepted and   what   will   be   rejected.   So   innovative constructions may be acceptable for one city, but not allowed in another one.

https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/21/greathomesanddestinations/amsterdam-embraces-residential-high-rises.html

&gt; AMSTERDAM ‚Äî The term ‚Äúhigh-rise‚Äù has special meaning in Amsterdam.
&gt;
&gt;The city government considers any building taller than 30 meters, or about 98 feet, to be a high-rise. But then the tallest building in Amsterdam, the Rembrandt Tower, is a 35-floor office structure that tops out at 135 meters. (So it would take more than six Rembrandt Towers to match the world‚Äôs tallest building, the Burj Khalifa, the 829.8-meter skyscraper in Dubai.)
&gt;
&gt;But as Amsterdam‚Äôs mayor, Eberhard van der Laan, noted in a recent televised interview, more high-rises would help the Dutch capital.
&gt;
&gt;‚ÄúThe power of Amsterdam is that it is actually a very small city,‚Äù Mr. Van der Laan said. To preserve that small scale in a place that now has almost 800,000 residents and expects roughly 35,000 more by 2020, the mayor said he sees few possibilities other than ‚Äúupwards.‚Äù
&gt;
&gt;Residents of Amsterdam have long resisted such development, many linking high-rise living with the vast concrete facades of the Bijlmermeer project and the problems of integration and crime that it experienced in the 1970s and early ‚Äô80s.

Well of course you can. Maybe the domestic market is limited since hydro and nuclear saturated all of it - good for climate though - but in a rational world there's always export options.

One thing for sure makes it impossible to sustain an industry, and that's precisely to stop building them.

They stopped building them because of the zeitgeist of the 80s, and the famous nuclear accidents which suddenly made it unpopular worldwide, not because building them was a disadvantage. The government actually wanted to entirely phase it out by law, but walked back on it after the people didn't confirm such desires.

5408,"&gt;but the differences between each nation are enough for nationality to be far more than just a nation defined by borders. History, culture, language, I can list more, 

&gt;but there is a reason sovereign states exist, and have done for the past few millennia.

Yeah, power grabs, buffer states, royal inheritances, balance of power, games of thrones...

&gt;Ultimately borders are defined by culture, not so much a nations lines on a map,

Moldova and Romania? Andorra and Catalonia? Switzerland and Liechtenstein? Austria and Bavaria? That strange thing called Belgium?


&gt;and to say all European nations share a culture is not very fair to the diversity of our continent.

But if everyone has their way, you'll find everyone telling you their little town is the quaintest little town in all of Europe, that their accent which is just pronouncing a couple of words differently is a completely different and full-featured language, they'll tell you their humor is either the darkest or the driest, that the national sport is to complain, there'll be like a dozen countries fighting over who made the first constitution, or who had democracy first or whose Cathedral's holy grail is the real one...

Everyone just loves to think they're way more special and unique than they actually are.


&gt;You will find now that people in Germany are happy to be German, 

There's a bunch of Bavarians who don't, though.

Actually, Germany is a good example of how nationhood can be created. For most of its recent history, it was just a bunch of mostly independent states each doing their own little thing, sometimes agreeing with each other, other times going to war over disagreements, etc. Then along comes the 19th century and the birth of the nation state. And the idea starts to spread that they all should unite into a country, hell a lot of people thought that that new German state should include Austria, and a lot of Austrians were in too, even well into the 20th century; it's just politics didn't play out that way. It's funny because Austrians love to get all hot and bothered about being called Germans, but not a hundred years back, that wasn't nearly as controversial a claim. Germans existed before a state could claim them. I'm also told there's cultural continuums between Germany and the Netherlands and Germany and Denmark, too.

Ditto for the Portuguese and Spain. The Portuguese are different from the rest of Spain, but it's not a level of difference you couldn't find within Spain, meaning there are regions in Spain with just as much of a difference between them and the central ""core"" culture as there is between said core and Portugal. It's not hard to imagine an alternative history where the Crown of Aragon remained independent and Portugal united into the ""Spains"". Again, the Spanish (Hispanic) existed before Spain could claim them. And once it did, the Spanish/Hispanic Portuguese stopped being Hispanic because only those from Spain could be Hispanic, and now calling the Portuguese Hispanic is an insult, just like calling the Austrians Germans.

My point being borders don't necessarily correspond with cultural boundaries, and when they do, is often because a culture was made to be different after a border separated it from the main body.

&gt;people in France happy to be French,

Except some Bretons and Corsicans. And even then it took a long process of ""frenchification"".

&gt;people in Britain happy to be British. 

I'll let you guess what examples I would use here.

&gt;If those borders changed now, people wouldn't just up and start calling themselves x nationality all of a sudden. 

Right. But it would only take them a few decades. You can be one country for centuries and be mostly the same, but suddenly you split, and a couple decades later all the kids being born will identify with their independent country instead of the original, even if culturally they're still pretty much the same (e.g. Australia, Cuba before communism, Moldova...).

&gt;A nationality is an idea of culture, history, language and community

Of which a good percentage is made up.

&gt; - borders have no effect on that.

I think history proves otherwise.

&gt; It just so happens different nationalities (defined by the above) stick to their borders, 

Only since technology and political will made it so that borders could be controlled.

Before that they were quite permeable, that's why you have cultural continuums all over across border regions.

&gt;Fundamentally, a border is where two cultures meet that are different enough that they cannot be said to be the same peoples. Far more than just a land border separating two countries. Ultimately, borders are based on cultural borders, not simple land borders. It's difficult to explain, hopefully it makes sense.

Explain Belgium then. In its place there should be a border between Germany and France, instead you've got a whole made up country which now has been a country for long enough to have a culture. The borders made the culture, and not the other way around.

&gt;A border does not define its nation, but rather a nation defines its borders.

And all throughout history nations have absorbed smaller nations, incorporated them first into their borders and later into their culture. Thought other times they were first a part of their culture and then a part of their borders. It's all too fuzzy to make any categorical claims.

True in comparison to the u.s, but we are still one the wealthiest and most militarily capable nations in the world, with a soft power that on many polls rivals or exceeds that of the u.s - so don't buy the argument we should just bend over and take it because we're not a superpower.

I should have said a fair or a serious deal, because they are not trying to that. The offer of the french ""deal"" is just the current status quo, unfettered access. A deal suggests compromise. As I said, if they want access, they should offer proper compensation- so I am not against a deal and arguing against it as you suggest, just a fair deal if there is one. 

With regards to where we would sell them...anywhere that wants them. There are lots of countries not in EU and they can travel pretty far on ice, but i'm not sure the eu would go through with that threat and they would just buy them.

Whilst i would say we obviously disagree about what constitutes a proper amount of compensation, you already agreed your country would refuse it because it is unfair. Something like at least double or triple the current offer think personally would be more reasonable.

Your last point valid and fair, but from one the from of the articles you linked - 
""Why were quotas sold off?
Many parts of the quota were sold by English fishermen in the 1990s when fishing rights were cut dramatically. Cod fishing, for instance, was almost entirely stopped for several years. *(BY THE EU)* Foreign companies then bought it up as a long-term investment, and experts say the quota market has been allowed to develop in an unregulated way ever since.""

5525,"&gt;Switzerland is a politically neutral country, yet it has a strong military. All across the Swiss alps are military installation and bunkers carefully hidden so as to blend into the surrounding landscape. Some of them are camouflaged as huge rocks, others as quiet villas or barns that could open up in the event of an emergency to reveal cannons and heavy machine guns that could blow any approaching army to smithereens. Enormous caverns are dugout on the mountain side to function as ad-hoc airbases with hangars. Every major bridge, tunnel, road and railway has been rigged so they could be deliberately collapsed, whenever required, to keep enemy armies out. Highways can be converted into runways by quickly removing the grade separations in between the lanes.

&gt;The country has nuclear fallout shelters in every home, institutions and hospitals, as well as nearly 300,000 bunkers and 5,100 public shelters that could accommodate the entire Swiss population if required. Switzerland also has one of the largest armies on a per capita basis, with 200,000 active personnel and 3.6 million available for service. Every male citizen under 34 years old (under 50 in some cases) is a reserve soldier. Soldiers are even allowed to take all personally assigned weapons to home.

5601,"&gt; You can try and twist my messages in any way you'd like. 

How am I doing that if I'm literally addressing your exact statement? Stop making bullshit excuses.

&gt; What my point was about is the fact that support for the EU in Poland is dwindling, and dwindling fast. 

No, your point was:

&gt; you've made the most EU-friendly country despise you now

Nothing about dwindling, but about already being against EU by an overwhelming majority. 

And sources for dwindling fast?

 &gt; We were by far the most EU-friendly country, even more supportive than the countries that profit most from its membership ( Germany and Netherlands for example ).

Yes and this is absolutely irrelevant with the topic at hand.


&gt; Whilst this my own personal observation, so it may not mean much, but the euroscepticism is visible among the people I know, especially when compared to opinions say 6 years ago. Poland's views do not match the views and goals of the EU, which is a recipe for divorce.


Your anecdotal evidences are irrelevant.


&gt; No such thing as state 'propaganda'.

You are fucking yourself if you think there isn't such a thing as state propaganda. This is so laughable bad lie it doesn't need to be even addressed, because it defeats itself automatically. And you think you have an audacity to tell someone has tiny brain LMAO. Or are you just hired LaJ troll?

&gt;  The national TV channel falls in the hands of any governing party, which worked to the benefit of PO ( Opposition ) when they were in office.

No other party turned public television into full blown state propaganda before, no matter in which hands was it. 

&gt; PO's propaganda was one of the main reason why Poland become so EU-positive in the first place. Talking about propaganda, isn't it seen as propaganda when our trams, buses, roads and government buildings are plastered with EU flags, declaring that this or that was funded by the EU? Isn't that subtle indoctrination, especially considering that all these things WEREN'T funded by the EU, rather bought with EU funds now, paid back with Polish money later. The EU is a glorified credit card with extra indoctrination sprinkled on top. 

That's right, PO's propaganda was one of the main reason why Poland become so EU positive and that's why [77.6% of people voted to enter EU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_Polish_European_Union_membership_referendum) in 2003. I didn't know PO could bend space time.

And you're comparing SUBTLE propaganda to crude, aggressive and snide propaganda?  Kekw. I don't even know if it could be counted as propaganda, if they were stating facts.

&gt; especially considering that all these things WEREN'T funded by the EU, rather bought with EU funds now, paid back with Polish money later.

Especially when you're talking out of your ass, you mean?


&gt; So according to which of your sources, is Poland not seen as a key player in the EU? Are you on fucking drugs? 

Oh, so you are going for strawman yet again? Mind quoting me saying anything about key player or are you on drugs? 


I was going to address this entire fragment, but then I realize it's pointless, becuase you are too stupid to address my point and instead went off topic.


&gt; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euroscepticism Go have a read. 

Still incorrect, you should provide the exact evidence and study. 

&gt; Also, do you own research and search for (...)

No, the burden of proof is on you. Either you provide evidences, or anything you say goes right to the trashbin.

&gt; And that's also projected to grow.

Based on what?


&gt;  Euroscepticism is also brewing among PiS voters. 

Due to state propaganda. What's new?



&gt; Fuck your strawmans,

YOU are the one who is using strawmans.


&gt; I pointed out your ignorant view, which is that Poland leeches off the EU, 

I literally haven't been talking about leeching off or money, you pulled it right out of your ass. And what's worse, you did that right after accusing me of strawman lmao. How stupid can you possibly be?

&gt; even though the EU profits from a significant presence in the Polish market 

Because Poland does not benefit from market in EU's countries and Poland does not benefit from presence of ther countries. Not one single bit. It's not like Poland needs EU far, FAR more than EU needs Poland.

You can save this kind of half assed argument on annual idiots convenction



&gt; Losing Poland would be devastating for the EU, 

Yeah, you can keep this laughable delusion of Poland being super important in EU lmao.


&gt; but as I said, I'm not going to start educating you, because you're stupid and don't want to be proven wrong. 

After denying state propaganda or lying in case of eurosceptic party you are in no position to educate anyone. 


&gt; Losing the UK, and losing Poland, Hungary and potentially the southern states would crush the EU... in fact losing any member state would prove awful. It's obvious to anyone with a brain.

and honestly, every time i go on reddit i am less convinced that at least some wouldn't expect a full compensation and would not rejoice in the impoverishment and destruction of germany. 

today it would be about as politically suicidal to cede claims as to accept them. (of course the german sentiment wouldn't matter legally, but many people would then joke about demanding compensation for napoleonic wars, the swedish contributions in the 30 year war, or for the roman occupation of germany. and people do think it's settled.)

the claims are legally unenforceable without a global power forcing them massively (and even then - souvereignity of nations would probably still hinder it legally, even if boots on the ground could change it factually)

i would like to a good friendship between countries in europe. of course some claim this would happen if Germany just paid. But the hatred not only bc of wwii would not stop. this would never stop.  
there are no friendships between nations, just interests. as displayed daily by politicians as well as on reddit. the hatred germany gets on here is even more than turkey or russia or the uk in brexit negotiations. if this is any indicator, i fear not only common currency or stuff like that, maybe even making the eu bigger than the founders might have been a mistake. i hate to think this. but this topic - after reading on it several times also on other subs - makes me believe collective suicide could have been a better version. not after wwii, after wwi at the latest.",,/r/europe/comments/k8863y/on_this_day_50_years_ago_during_his_visit_to/gf2rxor/,itzzettel,1607451254

5689,"&gt;Besides a few short periods of time it didn't, I mentioned lithuania major/minor as reference to my specification for their religious differences. 

So in essence I was right, Lithuania is traditionally Catholic.

&gt;basically there used to be (a mainly Polish speaking) calvinist community, quite reduced now due to soviet resettlement policy.

Were most Poles in Lithuania Calvinist at some point?

&gt;In my view, Estonia, in addition to baltic, also clearly fit into baltic-finnic culture

There is no such thing really. How can it be if Lithuania sticks out clearly?

&gt;you seem to treat them as contradictions. 

I understand that cultural groups do not need to be contradictions. I consider Estonia to be in the same cultural group with both the Nordic countries and with Latvia, due to different aspects of our culture.

&gt;I won't judge the importance of them in Latvia and Estonia, but to suggest that they are not important in Lithuania

Will you let me know if you find someone suggesting that?

&gt;You seriously want to complain about belittlement after all the things you've said about lithuanian culture?

I have said literally nothing negative about Lithuanian culture.

This is the point I don't get. Balts and especially Lithuanians get this feeling of insult as soon as Estonians state that they do not share some aspect with them. It's as if you take it as an insult that we have our own national identity...

&gt;I would consider centuries to be a bit longer than ""almost never"".

Please name those centuries and as a test of your short-term memory, please avoid naming periods under the same nominal rule, when we went through totally different experiences.

&gt;the cultural sphere where people go to saunas

I am sorry, but sauna culture is by far less important in Lithuania.

And I might agree with the psalteries being a common instrument from Finland to Lithuania, but how many aspects like that can you name? And furthermore, these are not main aspects of culture that should be used to divide countries into groups, but rather very specific ones that aren't necessarily related to other aspects.

5758,"You can try and twist my messages in any way you'd like. What my point was about is the fact that support for the EU in Poland is dwindling, and dwindling fast. We were by far the most EU-friendly country, even more supportive than the countries that profit most from its membership ( Germany and Netherlands for example ). Whilst this my own personal observation, so it may not mean much, but the euroscepticism is visible among the people I know, especially when compared to opinions say 6 years ago. Poland's views do not match the views and goals of the EU, which is a recipe for divorce. 
No such thing as state 'propaganda'. The national TV channel falls in the hands of any governing party, which worked to the benefit of PO ( Opposition ) when they were in office. PO's propaganda was one of the main reason why Poland become so EU-positive in the first place. Talking about propaganda, isn't it seen as propaganda when our trams, buses, roads and government buildings are plastered with EU flags, declaring that this or that was funded by the EU? Isn't that subtle indoctrination, especially considering that all these things WEREN'T funded by the EU, rather bought with EU funds now, paid back with Polish money later. The EU is a glorified credit card with extra indoctrination sprinkled on top. 

So according to which of your sources, is Poland not seen as a key player in the EU? Are you on fucking drugs?
Poland is positioned in the centre of Europe, an important trade route between Asia &amp; Russia and the EU. It is a key player in the region of EE, as its the most powerful and most populous country. It is the 6th most powerful country in the EU, and inevitably will overtake Italy and Spain in the near future if things go to plan. Our military is also more advanced than Germany's, even though they're a much wealthier country than us. I'm not going to convince you how significant Poland is in the EU, because you would've already known this if you weren't stupid. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euroscepticism Go have a read. Also, do you own research and search for who views the EU most unfavourably. You'll quickly find out who these countries are. 

Konfederacja, which received the 4th most amount of votes in the latest elections, has managed to overtake Lewica in the polls. Consistently. And that's also projected to grow. Euroscepticism is also brewing among PiS voters. 

Fuck your strawmans, I pointed out your ignorant view, which is that Poland leeches off the EU, even though the EU profits from a significant presence in the Polish market and the geographic location of Poland. Losing Poland would be devastating for the EU, but as I said, I'm not going to start educating you, because you're stupid and don't want to be proven wrong. 

Losing the UK, and losing Poland, Hungary and potentially the southern states would crush the EU... in fact losing any member state would prove awful. It's obvious to anyone with a brain.

5777,"&gt;A federal Europe would mean the end of dozens if not hundreds of cultures, traditions and languages (over the long term of course). Have you ever seen a country working with several languages and cultures without one taking the top spot? I like European diversity too much to let that happen.

Have you taken a good look at our modern culture recently? We watch American movies, we listen to American music. We are on an American website right now. Most of the younger generations speak English, just as we are doing right now. By the way, those American movies/songs/websites are being changed, so that *China* will accept them in its country as well. 

You really don't have to worry about German culture replacing/influencing Dutch culture, for example. You have to worry about American/Chinese culture replacing/influencing ours. Those are the real dangers to our cultures.  

European cultures can be saved in a federation that respects these cultures. A federation that is strong enough to defend us from foreign influence. You think America gives a shit about your culture? Fuck no. You think China gives a fuck about your culture? Fuck no.     

I would argue that the EU (and a federated Europe would) defend our cultures more, than going at it alone. European countries have been a slave to the United States for decades now, and see how much it has changed us already. This will only continue if we don't stand on our own two feet. 

&gt;Moreover being under the rules of a bunch of technocrats not elected by any one is not really something i'd like to become the norm.

So why not make the current system more democratic instead?

Besides, who are you talking about when you say 'not elected by any one'? Because if you mean the Commission, please note that if the people were to vote on the Commission directly, the member-states would LOSE sovereignty and we'd be a step *closer* to forming a true federation. 

Right now, the member-states have a say in who sits on the Commission. A Commission elected directly by the people would mean taking away sovereignty of the member-states.

#### The enemies of Europe

Despite the rapprochement of all the conditions set at the previous October Summit, in relation to the Turkish aggression and the due sanctions against Ankara (illegal explorations on the Greek continental shelf, illegal explorations and drilling in the EEZ of Cyprus, pirate Famagusta, illegal participation in the Nagorno-Karabakh war, illegal arms supply to Libya, preparation for a new invasion of Syria, etc.), Mrs. Merkel and her followers are talking about promoting a positive agenda with Turkey.

 Despite the rapprochement of all the conditions set at the previous October Summit, in relation to the Turkish aggression and the due sanctions against Ankara (illegal explorations on the Greek continental shelf, illegal explorations and drilling in the EEZ of Cyprus, pirate Famagusta, illegal participation in the Nagorno-Karabakh war, illegal arms supply to Libya, preparation for a new invasion of Syria, etc.), Mrs. Merkel and her followers are talking about promoting a positive agenda with Turkey.  
It is objectively a tragically failed presidency at a critical juncture in fluid geopolitical upheaval combined with the COVID-19 pandemic, in which Germany, with Germany's sovereign responsibility, has remained in a co-op role instead of pursuing a strengthened geopolitical role as befits it.  
The same situation prevailed in the other big issue of the pandemic, where in relation to the multiannual financial framework (2021-2027), amounting to 1.1 trillion. euro and the recovery fund, since at first germany refused any joint action, even after its withdrawal due to french pressure, everything, 8 months later, remains open and vague, at a time when european societies are being severely tested.  
Germany's destructive role in relation to European geopolitical support to the detriment of European interests is particularly reflected in its attitude towards Turkey, which is favored by the German establishment, although not a member of the EU, towards its equal members. , such as Greece and Cyprus. With Mrs Merkel, Mr Borrell and Mrs Michel's submissive bodies, on the one hand, the word ""sanctions"" is being eradicated from the Dangerous multilateral international conference for the Eastern Mediterranean, where Turkey could unhinderedly establish and legitimize all its unilateral illegal aspirations against Greece and Cyprus, ie European interests.  
Of course, nothing is accidental, since apart from the traditionally close historical relations between Germany and Turkey, at the economic level, the relations between these two countries are very close and important. Turkish exports to Germany amount to about $ 18 billion, being their most important destination, while imports from Germany in machinery, electronics, vehicles, etc., which reach about $ 23 billion, are very important. Finally, Turkey's imports of weapons systems are large. It is noteworthy that today, 6 submarines type 214 (respectively of Papanikolis) are being built, which are completed with intensity of work in order to claim to be consistent in delivery !, although these are weapons that are aimed directly at two European countries.  
In conclusion, at a time when American power is declining and a multipolar world is emerging with major conflicts around the world (Ukraine crisis, Russia-West economic conflict, Sino-Russian approach, Sino-US confrontation, Islamic terrorism and complete destabilization of the Middle East, Libya, Eastern Mediterranean, Syria, etc. with the intensifying Turkish policy), one would expect the effort of geopolitical strengthening of Europe and not its ""dwarfism"". But the one that was the theater of world wars and rivalries, and should be an island of normalcy and stability in this new world that is being formed, by taking relevant initiatives, Due to the narrow-minded monetarist economic policy and narrow national aspirations of the powerful European countries, it has become one of the weakest links in the world. What else can be deduced from the German pro-Ottoman stance in favor of neo-Ottoman expansion, which roams Europe directly and threatens countries such as France and Austria in addition to its neighbors?  
It is certain that this attitude of Germany towards the geopolitical orientation of Europe, will be the matrix of great internal divisions of the EU.  
From the above it can be concluded that Hellenism is in great danger. The forthcoming summit should be the starting point for strengthening the strategic relationship with France, which has been undermined in recent times by unjustified government responsibilities. Overall, a change of attitude is required for Greece to become a sovereign state.",,/r/europe/comments/k90qst/eu_countries_feel_numb_about_turkey_ahead_of/gf1ykq9/,Flaymart,1607436840

The euro sprang into existence because France was afraid the Deustchmark would become too strong and they were more of less correct. Germany agreed to the europ because it was the price of renuniting the country. In return they got control of the Central bank.

I think the more realistic answer is European leaders realized the USSR was breathing down its neck, the USA was hegemon and the only option left was to band together or become a stagnant backwater. The loss of colonies made it impossible for European nations to be world players like  in the 19th century. Atomic weapons made war something insane to contemplate.

If the EU parliament gets the initiative right, it would be able to take the EU in directions the Member States dont want it to go. It would surpass the Council.

Personnaly I would prefer this direction, but there is a valid democratic reason why the Council, the democratically elected heads of state, is the captain of the ship.

\&gt;  To make things worse, the people working in the European Commission don't really respond well to public outcries.

5987,"&gt;Congratulations you fucks, you've made the most EU-friendly country despise you now.

I fail to see the logic in this. Polish government says it is against the coronavirus fund and doesn't want to participate (this is what the veto means). EU says ""Ok, guys, your choice. You don't want it - you won't get it"" and countries willing to participate make an agreement outside of EU. At this point Poland starts despising the EU for what exactly?? You despise it because the EU listened to Polish government and got exactly what they asked for?

No, you start despising it because EU called your bluff. Poland actually wanted the money, but abused the veto and is now angry that they were caught. If Polish people want to participate, but Polish government used the veto, then the Polish people should direct their anger towards the Polish government who went against their wishes, not the EU who just followed what the Polish government signalled to them.

To every country that is against the EU I say - leave it and see how much fun you will have without the EU. I sometimes think that countries need a reminder of how it is to be outside EU, similar to how antivaxxers needed a good reminder of how it was before the vaccines. EU is not USSR and no one is forcing anyone to stay with tanks and military. However, since you know that the membership is beneficial, of course you will not leave. And at that point it means that you are voluntarily a member of the EU for your own benefit. Being against the EU while reaping the benefits of being inside is being a hypocrite.",,/r/europe/comments/k8oyvj/eu_gives_hungary_and_poland_24_hours_to_lift_veto/gf1pdv6/,UnusualString,1607430231
